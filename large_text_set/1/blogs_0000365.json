But just like in years past, it didn’t take very long for the reminder that this could be it to come crashing down on a handful of players inside the Minnesota locker room. \nSome will not be re-signed by the team, some will opt to go elsewhere, some may be traded before the 2017 season starts and a few more might have played their last snaps in the NFL. Regardless of the reason, there are a handful of players on this 2016 Minnesota Vikings team that might have played their last downs in purple...fifteen of them to be exact. Here their statuses and projected results... Matt Kalil (LT) You almost have to re-sign Matt Kalil next season with the current status of the Vikings offensive line. That said, he won’t be cheap and he’ll have all the negotiating power with the team acting out of desperation. Captain Munnerlyn (CB) At 28 years old, Munnerlyn’s role on the team might be dwindling. He’ll probably land somewhere in 2017 but it may not be in Minnesota. Andre Smith (RT) He gone. Shaun Hill (QB) Hill might not have made the final roster this season had Taylor Heinicke not stuck his foot through a window and the whole Teddy’s leg almost falling off thing. He’s 36 and might be set for a nice retirement. Chad Greenway (LB) Greenway remained non-committal following today’s game saying that he will step away for a few weeks before making his final decision. If I were a betting man, I would say that Chad walks away with his head held high as one of the most highly revered Vikings players of all-time. Terence Newman (CB) Newman showed his age a bit this year, for the first time since joining MN. The tread might be thin and according to his coach, Mike Zimmer might try and pry him away from the field to become a coach ASAP. Cordarrelle Patterson (WR) What an interesting situation. Once loved, then hated and now seemingly loved again, Patterson seems to have figured it out. Not just on the football field but off of it as well. He’s regained his impact as a returner, found a role as a receiver and seems to enjoy it here in this locker room. I would guess they try to keep him here on a team friendly deal. Rhett Ellison (TE) You won’t see it pop up in the stat books but Rhett’s role here in MN is an important one. That said, rookie David Morgan fits a similar mold and may be a cheaper option to fill that gap. Zach Line (FB) There will likely be a new approach at running back in 2017 and keeping a skilled FB in line could help that transition go a bit easier. Jake Long (LT) It was a nice experiment bringing him in in a pinch, but it failed. Long will probably not get another chance in the NFL. Matt Asiata (RB) This might be one of the more difficult decisions. Assuming #28 is gone next year, Asiata could have a role. He’s beloved in the locker room and works hard all the time. But, could that be replaced by a more effective option through free agency? I think it might be. Audie Cole (LB) Audie just seems to fit here in Minnesota. He’s a valued member for depth, he’s a good special teamer and I think he likes it here. If he has a choice in the matter (which he may not) I think he returns. Justin Trattou (DE) Tratt had some moments with the team but increased depth with young players might move him elsewhere for another shot on a different team. Jeff Locke (P) With a Pro Bowl caliber season early, Locke’s year fizzled a little down the stretch but not enough to start anew with a different punter in 2017. And then there’s one more… Adrian Peterson (RB) \nNot a free agent, but standing to cost the team over $18 million in 2017, there is simply no change that Adrian returns...for that price. There’s a small chance that he returns, but at a highly reduced rate which I’m not sure if he’s ready to admit. He could get a shot as a starter somewhere else and in his mind I don’t think he’s ready to shed that starting label. We’ve most likely seen the end of AP in Minnesota. \nCheck out Vikings.com for more information and Minnesota Vikings coverage throughout the year!
