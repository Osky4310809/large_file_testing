What happened on the sets of the film in Jaipur has been making headlines every day. After Sanjay Leela Bhansali issued an official statement regarding the dream sequence between Rani Padmavati (Deepika Padukone) and Allaudin Khilji (Ranveer Singh), the members of Kirni Sena have yet again threatened Bhansali. Speaking to a leading daily, spokesperson of the Kirni Sena – Vijendra Singh Kalyanwat said, “The newspaper Rajasthan Patrika carried a report that there was a dream sequence in the film, which shows Deepika meeting Ranveer Singh. Now Rani Padmini is not an ordinary woman. She is like a devi in Rajasthan. And you cannot show this devi meeting a terrorist like Alauddin Khilji even in his dreams. Rajputs will never tolerate this. If Bhansali distorts history and shoots the film in Mumbai, we will go there and destroy his sets like we did in Jaipur.” He further went on to say how the members of the group tried to get in touch with Bhansali and his team to express their discontent with the dream sequence but they didn’t get any response. “We wrote many letters to Bhansali’s office and expressed our opposition to the film. We wrote that history should not be distorted. We also wrote to the information and broadcasting ministry. On Friday, when we went to meet Bhansali at Jaigarh fort, his guards fired in the air. After the firing there was a scuffle. Bhansali’s bodyguards fired four rounds, following which the situation got out of hand,” (ALSO READ: Padmavati Row: Karni Sena demands Sanjay Leela Bhansali to change the title of his film ) \nFor all those who don’t know, the members of the Karni Sena created a ruckus on the sets of the film last week, Bhansali Productions had even issued an official statement regarding the same in which they had stated that there is no dream sequence or any objectionable scene between Allaundin Khilji and Rani Padmavati. “We have been carefully researching and making the film. In spite of this, the attack on the shoot and crew was uncalled for and was extremely damaging to the image of the beautiful city of Jaipur. We are grateful to the authorities at Jaipur who responded promptly and limited the damage on shoot. We are confident that Mewar will be proud of the film made on their revered queen. We do not want to hurt any sentiments and would appreciate if the local people support us in making this film and making their queen revered by the world,” read the statement further.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:09:03.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
