Their right to enter our country supersedes our own concerns (which is definitely not true).” \nYet when it comes to unborn children, leftists dismiss these exact same arguments, maintaining instead that unborn children do not deserve to be treated with respect but instead deserve to wiped out of existence so as to not impose an undue burden on the mother.
