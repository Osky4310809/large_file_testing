Xhaka has been criticised from some quarters for his displays (Photo: Clive Mason) Kante has starred for Chelsea (Photo: PA) \nBut Wenger said: “They are different type of players. Xhaka is more in the distribution of the pass through the lines and Kante is more the ball winner with the real technique to steal the ball without making the foul. \n“You should compare Kante with Francis Coquelin more than with Xhaka.” \nXhaka’s attempts to live up to his price tag since his move from Borussia Monchengladbach haven’t been helped by his poor disciplinary record. \nXhaka arrived in England with a reputation for ill-discipline having committed the third most fouls in Germany last year and being the second-most sent off player in Europe’s top five leagues in the previous three seasons. \nLittle has changed on that front with Xhaka picking up eight yellows and two reds for Arsenal this season plus another caution and dismissal for Switzerland.
