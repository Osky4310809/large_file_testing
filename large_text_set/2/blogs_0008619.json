The video starts as the snake is halfway through its lunch, having already ingested the possum’s shoulders. \nViewers were able to ask questions as they watched the snake eat its snack. \nSnake catcher Lana Field highlighted the importance of allowing the snake to eat in peace so it doesn’t start to regurgitate the possum. Aside from it being a waste of a good meal, the possum could also scratch the snake’s insides on the way out. \nShe also confirmed that the possum was killed by the python before it started eating it. \nThe video lasts for almost an hour. After the snake had swallowed all of the possum, Field allowed it to rest before removing it from the garden. \nIt will take about two weeks for the snake to fully digest its furry lunch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:19:52.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
