When Ronda Rousey was murdered in the fall of 2015, the talk of her being able to stand toe-to-toe with Floyd vanished, and we moved on to the UFC’s only remaining superstar, Conor McGregor. MMA die-hards argue that nobody in the world can take McGregor’s left hand, boxing purists claim that McGregor wouldn’t even be able to touch Mayweather, and casual fans think it’d be the fight of the century. \nThere’s a ridiculous amount of obstacles in front of Mayweather/McGregor stepping into a ring, but the unofficial contract negotiations are underway, and all parties involved want it to happen. \nThis week, Mayweather countered McGregor’s $100 million demand with an offer of $15 million and a cut of the pay per view. If we look at that logistically, and assume it’s 25% of the pay per view’s revenue and the fight does around 3 million buys (Mayweather/Paquiao did 4.6mil, so this is a LOW estimate), Conor’s looking at almost $50 million. \nDana White publicly offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million a piece for the matchup today, and while everyone’s looking at that calling it ridiculous, and it kind of is, that’s how you start negotiations. Low. Especially with two money savages like Conor and Floyd. Mayweather did make over $200 million himself for the Paquiao fight, so use that as an indicator of how far off they are. \nDon’t expect an announcement any time soon, but keep your eye on the moves being made on both sides. This is, without a doubt, something to monitor. And if it does happen, put the house on Floyd. Mortal lock of human history.
