Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017\nIt was just coincidence, surely, that Jeanine Pirro tore Ryan limb from limb.\n\"Speaker Ryan, you come in with all your swagger and experience and you sell them a bill of goods that ends up a complete and total failure.\nAnd you allow our president in his first 100 days to come out of the box like that, based on what Your legislative expertise, your knowledge of the arcane ins and outs of the bill writing-process? Your relationships? What? Your drinks at the Hay Adams with your pals?\"\n\"Paul Ryan needs to step down as speaker of the house.The reason? He failed to deliver the votes on his healthcare bill.\" #openingstatement pic.twitter.com/75WbI4mcYX\n— Jeanine Pirro (@JudgeJeanine) March 26, 2017\n\"I want to be clear: this is not on President Trump. No one expected a business man to completely understand the nuances ... of Washington,\" Pirro went on, fulsomely defending the president in a way Trump definitely did not intend for America to hear.\nThe Fox anchor insisted she had not spoken to Trump directly. Nevertheless, in her honest opinion, he is handling the healthcare collapse \"with dignity.\"\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer downplayed Trump's tweet earlier Saturday. According to the Washington Post , Spicer said Trump tweeted only because he was a fan of Pirro's show.\nIn any case, no one noticed that little Trump-Pirro coincidence apart from most of the internet.\nThis morning @POTUS tweeted: \"Watch @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00 P.M.\" https://t.co/kgFwkkbT8G\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 26, 2017\nQuick look at Trump and Paul Ryan talking tonight pic.twitter.com/gYimciiAWr\n— Jensen Karp (@JensenClan88) March 26, 2017\nThis is a COLD-BLOODED Trump move.
