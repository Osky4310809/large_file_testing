But in a super lovable way, of course. With this in mind, we’d say that Miley Cyrus just won Valentine’s Day with her shout-out to Liam Hemsworth , because it’s legit hysterical.\nCyrus posted a photo to I nstagram of her and Hemsworth posing together on a red carpet wearing the exact same glamorous , sparkly heart-covered red dress. Except, someone photoshopped Hemsworth into the pic, as well as the dress.\nMaking her Valentine’s Day post the big winner of the day. A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Feb 14, 2017 at 8:44am PST \n“@liamhemsworth & I wish you a VERY love V-Day ❤️ ,” she captioned the pic.\nThe actual photo of Cyrus was taken back in 2015 at the amfAR Inspiration Gala in NYC . But since the dress is perfect for Valentine’s Day, Cyrus brought it back for good measure.\n\nOf course, Hemsworth isn’t her only valentine this year, she also threw out a request to Laverne Cox to join her and Tyler Ford in their little valentine threesome. She wrote, “@lavernecox will you be our Valentine? ❤️ @tywrent”\nA post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Feb 14, 2017 at 8:07am PST \nFord is a former contestant on The Glee Project and was Cyrus’ date to the amfAR event.\nMeet Tyler (@tywrent), a 24 year old living in New York City, and my date for @amfar tonight!!! Tyler is a queer, biracial, agender person, whose pronouns are they/them/theirs. Tyler shares about their identity, experiences and hopes saying: “My whole life, I was led to believe that there were only two genders. I thought I had to shrink myself to fit into a box that was never going to contain me. It took years for me to find words for my gender identity, and to feel comfortable expressing myself as I am.” #happyhippiepresents #instapride @happyhippiefdn @instagram \nA post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jun 16, 2015 at 7:38am PDT \nCyrus clearly has mad love for her friend. She posted a collage of pictures from that night and wrote,\n“Have a Happy Hippie Valentime !
