Barron will be escorted to and from school by his mother, Melania, who has vowed to keep him enrolled in the prestigious Upper West Side preparatory school until the end of the school year, so as not to up-end the boy's life too greatly. \nHowever some New Yorkers have expressed concern over the traffic jam that is likely to ensue, given Manhattan's already notoriously slow early morning gridlock. \nIn a bid to reduce traffic congestion, the Secret Service, in conjunction with the NYPD, will enforce a rolling blockade of streets, first closing and then re-opening them as soon as Melania and Barron's car passes.  This option has been selected over the alternative, which would be to barricade the entire route all at once - a process that would likely lead to massive lane foreclosures and a buildup of traffic throughout the entire Upper West Side.  \nIn addition, the route the First Lady and her young son will take is set to change regularly, for security purposes.  \nIt remains to be seen if New Yorkers will suffer from or not even notice the effects of the motorcade. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T18:58:43.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
