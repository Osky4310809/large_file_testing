The Washington Redskins rewarded him for the effort Friday, the team announced . Ian Rapoport of NFL Network first reported the news. Terms were not released. Quick entered the league as a second-round pick in 2012 and struggled to find his footing at the NFL level. He posted 156 receiving yards and two scores as a rookie and was not much better in his second season, with 302 receiving yards and two touchdown catches. The pass-catcher wasn't living up to the hype that surrounded him coming out of Appalachian State. However, Alex Alarcon of USA Today 's Rams Wire said Quick's breakthrough \"seemed that it could be on the horizon\" in 2014 during the first half of the campaign. That was before a shoulder injury cut his season short at just seven games. He followed that with a mere 10 catches for 102 yards in 2015, but the Rams offered him a one-year deal. According to Ryan Kartje of the Orange County Register : \"When the team called with the offer, he swelled with confidence. He says their trust has him more motivated than ever.\" That motivation led to 41 catches for 564 yards and three touchdowns in a full 16-game schedule. He was second on the team in receiving yards behind only Kenny Britt's 1,002, and he finally appeared to be a difference-making receiver in the NFL. Still, Pro Football Focus gave him a mediocre grade of 61.1 in its 2017 free-agency tracker, which was 35th among wide receivers. While the lack of an established resume likely hurt his earning potential on the open market, Quick is still only 27 years old. Until the 2016 campaign, Quick was just a potential-filled receiver with athleticism and height (6'3\") who could theoretically develop into an impact weapon. He still hasn't fulfilled expectations, but he turned the corner in a healthy season and will now have a chance to build on that with a new team.
