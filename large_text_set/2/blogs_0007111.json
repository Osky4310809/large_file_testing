Logue filed a Freedom of Information (FOI) request for the files after noticing both uniformed and plainclothes officers “regularly and openly recording events as they were taking place,” court documents said. \nMass protests erupted at Grand Central Station in December 2014 after a grand jury decided not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in July of that year. Garner’s death was caught on video and ruled a homicide by the city medical examiner, but the grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo on any charges. \nSuch surveillance would likely be in violation of the 1985 Handschu Agreement, a consent agreement that prohibited indiscriminate police videotaping and photographing of public gatherings unless there was some indication of unlawful activity . A revised version from 2002 still contained a clause to force the NYPD to turn over the files related to their public surveillance program. \nThe NYPD initially argued that it didn’t have any records relating to the protest, but FOI requests granted by Metro-North and the New York City subway system showed correspondence between the two transit agencies and police. The department then argued that its records weren’t subject to the state’s FOI law because it would reveal tactics that would interfere with law enforcement’s work. #NYPD used undercover police to snoop on #BlackLivesMatter protests - court documents https://t.co/7jfbYnt6b9 pic.twitter.com/lb6W61Pgag — RT America (@RT_America) September 30, 2016 \nSupreme Court Justice Manuel Mendez denied the NYPD’s request to withhold the documents because their reasoning was “overly broad.” \nThe “speculative and conclusive claims” used in the FOI denial “of potential related ongoing investigations of incidents against police officers, both in New York and outside of the state and generalized references to use of the materials by” Islamic State terrorists “fail to provide a causal connection to the protesters and are insufficient to state a generic risk,” Mendez wrote. \nThe NYPD has a “long history” of “surveilling and infiltrating protest movements and other related First Amendment activity,” similar to the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO), and Logue wanted to see if the department was compiling dossiers on Black Lives Matter protesters, lawyer MJ Williams, who worked on the case, told RT.
