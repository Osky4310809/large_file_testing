(AP) — A federal judge in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order that for one week will block green card holders arriving at Dulles International Airport from being removed from the country. \nThe order, issued Saturday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema, also says that anyone detained at the airport should have access to a lawyer. \nThe motion was filed by the Legal Aid Justice Center on behalf of more than 50 permanent residents detained at Dulles on Saturday. \nThe order came shortly after a judge in New York granted a temporary stay preventing refugees entering the United States from being deported. \nPresident Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and blocking entry by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
