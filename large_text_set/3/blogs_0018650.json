One resident who lived on the ninth floor said she could only hear the trains coming into the station when the surrounding neighbourhood becomes quiet.\nShe was Quote: d as saying: \"But it isn't really noise and doesn't hurt the ears.\"\nImage: Sipa Asia/REX/Shutterstock\nAnother resident — who lived on the 11th floor — said that she was not aware of any noise coming from the train either. \"We've lived here for nearly nine years, and there's not one instance where the monorail's noise was the cause of complaint,\" she said. \"The cars on the street are even louder.\"\nThe apartment block and railway line in the central Chinese city took two years to design, and nearly four years to build. The rail is part of the Chongqing Line 2, which spans the southern end of the city, and was completed in 2005.\nThe first five floors consist of commercial space, so the train doesn't run past any residential houses, either. The 9th to 19th floors are residential.\nImage: Sipa Asia/REX/Shutterstock\nThe Liziba station, where you get on the train is between the 6th and 8th floor, and the train runs through 132 meters (433 ft) of the building, said design lead for the station, Ye Tianyi.\nYe reportedly said in 2014 that the trains cause little to no vibration to the building, because the complex's support structures are independent of the rail's.\n\"Between the six pillars that support the rail and the building, there is about 20cm (7.9 in) of distance,\" Ye told the Chongqing Evening News .\nThe station from street level\nImage: Weibo\nThe stations have even become minor attractions, say residents, who often witness tourists taking pictures at the train platforms itself.\nThe station from the monorail car\nImage: Weibo\nWATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge", "external_links": ["http://www.chinanews.com/sh/2014/08-15/6494984.shtml", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/rgQB8NjD.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mPJt3dcbuTib1lqC8aM1UnB6lrY=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420729%2F73880aa3-086e-4cf4-86c6-b37bdfdc5737.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/rgQB8NjD.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cy71kL-VJZ7Cc_c9Av5c6WJGMpM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420723%2F1a40bd0d-a33c-4d9f-8b80-95d7d6f48da1.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FI0zL2ORFUWWoDsB0puAxPoaFCE=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420729%2F73880aa3-086e-4cf4-86c6-b37bdfdc5737.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AxTnZw_dCQMMZgNU_QrCzIroujs=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420716%2F1776e403-563b-4113-b453-f90c7dc4bff5.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8D6HUKs0ScR1uti3rfhiJ1u8bQc=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420716%2F1776e403-563b-4113-b453-f90c7dc4bff5.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aU855ab6chEmGPUWqm2dkVad74I=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420731%2Fd61ca088-9320-479b-9c3a-adc265d1ee3b.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bkc2OfOL_AA9GuKg-_GhaSAFUas=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420723%2F1a40bd0d-a33c-4d9f-8b80-95d7d6f48da1.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NdRtqUnuKukX00HAYY9uIxsSRpI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420731%2Fd61ca088-9320-479b-9c3a-adc265d1ee3b.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-21T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T11:11:43.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
