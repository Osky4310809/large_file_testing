Fox Searchlight Pictures has acquired worldwide distribution and remake rights to Amanda Lipitz's documentary \"Step\" following its buzzed-about world premier at the Sundance Film Festival . \nThe film follows the senior year of three students at The Baltimore Leadership School for Young Women while they prepare to compete in a local step competition and to become the first members of their families to attend college. The action unfolds against the backdrop of the city's unrest following the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray . \nIt's a first film for Lipitz, who's previously worked as a Broadway producer. (Her credits include 'Legally Blonde.\") \n“We hope that the heroes of STEP will inspire girls everywhere to do what they have done, which is to prove that nothing is impossible when you surround yourself with a group of powerful women,” Lipitz said in a press release issued by Fox Searchlight. \nAccording to a press release, the production was financed with help from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Baltimore Ravens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T05:35:52.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
