Now that Emma and Regina are stuck in the Wish Realm, they are bound to run into a few familiar faces — and the nostalgia is almost too much for us to handle. Not only does August Booth (aka Pinocchio) make a special appearance, but everyone's favorite bandit, Robin Hood, is also back in action and looking as gorgeous as ever. Here's hoping the gang can find a way to bring him back to Storybrooke , because we definitely aren't over his untimely death from last season . While Regina is reuniting with her true love, Belle and Rumple are having a family reunion of their own as their son Gideon returns to cause chaos ( and potentially kill Emma ). Relish all the magical moments ahead! Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:28:55.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
