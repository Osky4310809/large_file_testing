Therefore I can't stand if they participate the 2018 winter Olympic game in Pyeongchang, South Korea since the people in Korea trade and eat dog meats in their country. I know all those NHL hockey players love dogs so much, and even some of them are dog rescuers. And since the ice hockey competition is one of the major event in the winter Olympic game if they do not attend, it will be a huge damage to the Olympic game organizer in South Korea. I will send this petition to the NHL headquarter and 30 NHL organizations in US and Canada. And if they refuse our requests, I will make other petitions to make fans not to attend NHL games and watch their games in television! I know that's gonna kill me because I'm a huge fan of ice hockey game. But now it's time to stand up for the poor dogs!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:58:40.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
