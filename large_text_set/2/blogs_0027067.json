The wife or woman ought to respect and love her husband and submit graciously to his demands. \nEvangelical - Southern Baptists are Evangelical meaning they adhere to the belief that while humanity is fallen, the good news is that Christ came to pay the penalty for our sins on the cross. That penalty, now paid in full, means that God offers forgiveness and new life as a free gift. All who will receive Christ as Lord may have it. \nEvangelism - The Good News is so vital that telling it is like sharing a cure for cancer. One could not keep it to himself. Evangelism and missions have their supreme place in Baptist life. \nHeaven and Hell - Southern Baptists believe in a heaven and hell. People who fail to recognize God as the one and only are sentenced to eternity in hell . \nOrdination of Women - Baptists believe Scripture teaches that men and women are equal in value, but have different roles in the family and the church. Pastoral leadership positions are reserved for men. \nPerseverance of the Saints - Baptists do not believe that true believers will fall away and, thereby, lose their salvation. This is sometimes called, \"Once saved, always saved.\" The proper term, however, is the final perseverance of the saints. It means that real Christians stick with it. It doesn't mean the believer won't stumble, but refers to an inward pull that will not allow him to quit the faith. \nThe Priesthood of Believers - The Baptist position of the priesthood of believers upholds their belief in religious liberty. All Christians have equal access to God's revelation of truth through the careful study of the Bible . This is a position shared by all post-reformational Christian groups. \nRegeneration - When one receives Jesus Christ as Lord, the Holy Spirit does an internal work within the person to redirect his life, making him born again. The biblical term for this is \"regeneration.\" This is not merely choosing to \"turn over a new leaf,\" but is a matter of God beginning a life-long process of changing our desires and affections. \nSalvation - The only way to get into heaven is salvation through Jesus Christ . To achieve salvation one must confess faith in God who sent his Son Jesus to die on the cross for the sins of humankind. \nSalvation by Faith - It is only by faith and belief that Jesus died for humanity and that he is the one and only God that people gain entrance into heaven. \nThe Second Coming - Baptists generally believe in the literal Second Coming of Christ when God will judge and divide between the saved and the lost and Christ will judge believers, rewarding them for acts done while living on earth. \nSexuality and Marriage - Baptists affirm God's plan for marriage and that the sexual union was designed to be \"one man, and one woman, for life.\" According to God's Word, homosexuality is a sin, though not an unforgivable sin . \nThe Trinity - Southern Baptists believe in only one God who reveals himself as God the Father , God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. \nThe True Church - The doctrine of a believer's church is a key belief in Baptist life. Members come into the church personally, individually, and freely. No one is \"born into the church.\" Only those who have personal faith in Christ comprise the true church in the eyes of God, and only those should be counted as members of the church. \nFor more about the Southern Baptist denomination visit the Southern Baptist Convention . \n(Sources: ReligiousTolerance.org, ReligionFacts.com, AllRefer.com, and the Religious Movements Web site of the University of Virginia.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:04:08.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
