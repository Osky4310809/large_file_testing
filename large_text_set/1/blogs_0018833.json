Cobi Hamilton dropped a touchdown, and Jesse James was marked down inside the 1-yard line after replay review overturned his score. New England then stuffed Williams on two straight runs before Roethlisberger threw an incompletion to Eli Rogers. More problematic for the Steelers was the fact New England was 100-1 with a halftime lead at home since 2001, per Pro-Football-Reference.com . The Patriots continued to control the proceedings to start the second half. They forced a three-and-out and drove into field-goal range, where Gost kowski drilled a 47-yarder to make it 20-9. Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin challenged a potential Brady fumble on the drive but did not win. Another defensive stop put New England in position to essentially bury the Steelers, and it took full advantage. Pittsburgh continued to lose Hogan in the secondary, and his 39-yard reception moved the Patriots into the red zone, where LeGarrette Blount steamrolled his way to an 18-yard run and then punched it in from the 1-yard line. The NFL highlighted his physicality: NFL @NFL .@LG_Blount carrying the ENTIRE PIT defense with him. And he gets the TD on the next play! #PITvsNE #NFLPlayoffs https://t.co/CBgc5sYiDw New England extended its commanding grip on the game when Rob Ninkovich recovered Rogers' fumble. Brady parlayed the turnover into a 10-yard touchdown pass to Edelman and earned the admiration of James Grega Jr. of Scout: James Grega Jr. @JGrega11 Tom Brady can make any wide receiver in the NFL look like a damn pro bowler. Dude is the üêê 1/23/2017, 1:50:26 AM The Steelers appeared to trim the deficit when Hamilton caught a touchdown, but he was flagged for illegal touching. New England stopped them on 4th-and-goal on the ensuing play and took over with all the momentum and a 33-9 lead in the fourth quarter. Things got worse for the Steelers when Roethlisberger threw an interception right to Eric Rowe on Pittsburgh's next possession, which New England turned into a field goal and 36-9 advantage. Roethlisberger made the final score somewhat more respectable with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Hamilton and two-point conversion to Williams, but it was far too little, too late. What's Next? While the Steelers turn their attention toward an offseason where improving their secondary could take priority after Sunday's game, the Patriots will begin preparations for Super Bowl LI in Houston on Feb. 5. New England and Atlanta did not play in the regular season, so there isn't a direct head-to-head showdown to evaluate. From an experience standpoint, the Falcons haven't been to the Super Bowl since the 1999 season. Brady and the Patriots are seasoned veterans when it comes to fighting for the Lombardi Trophy, but Matt Ryan will make his first appearance on such a stage. Experience or not, it will be difficult to beat the Patriots if they play like they did on Sunday.
