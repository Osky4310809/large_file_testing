He said it was a relief after spending the past three years giving painful testimony. (Erin Cox) \n\"It's a huge accomplishment. Also a huge weight,\" Wilson said. \"To expose yourself like that is so painful.\" \nTo gain passage, two powerful opponents had to be won over: the Catholic church and Del. Joseph F. Vallario Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Their concerns were satisfied when the bill was amended to make it more difficult for older victims to win damages in civil lawsuits. \n\"We think this is a fair compromise,\" said Mary Ellen Russell, executive director of the Maryland Catholic Conference.

(Amy Davis/Baltimore Sun video) See more videos \nWilson has told colleagues for the past three years about how he was beaten and raped by his adoptive father as a child, and how the effects of the abuse linger decades later. \nWhile the bill is \"not a silver bullet,\" Wilson hopes that it will offer one measure of legal help to child abuse victims. \nOften, he said, people who were abused as children only come to terms with what happened to them well into adulthood — sometimes when they have children of their own. \nThose victims would then find out that Maryland law only allows civil lawsuits until the victim is 25 years old. Wilson's bill extends that deadline until age 38 — 20 years after becoming a legal adult. \nThe Catholic church had fought versions of the bill for years, even before Wilson became the bill's chief champion. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, two representatives from the Maryland Catholic Conference sat alongside Wilson in support of the bill. \n\"This is a fair way of allowing these people to have their time in court,\" Russell said. \nFor victims up to age 25, the bill allows courts to award damages against institutions that employ or supervise abusers if negligence is proven. For older victims, the bill requires gross negligence — a tougher legal standard — in order to award damages. \nVallario said the change in liability for the older cases satisfied his concerns, and led him to allow the committee vote after preventing one for years. \nVallario said it can be difficult for institutions such as churches to defend cases decades after the alleged abuse occurred. \"Sometimes these priests are dead and it's very hard for the church to defend,\" the Prince George's County Democrat said in an interview. \nThe Maryland Catholic Conference had previously objected to the bill because churches that employed abusers would be held to a different standard than government institutions that were responsible for abusers such as teachers or foster care parents. \nThe Catholic church has been enmeshed in controversy for years over sexual abuse of children at the hands of priests. The Archdiocese of Baltimore has paid millions of dollars in claims lodged by dozens of people. The diocese has a policy of offering voluntary settlements regardless of the amount of time that passed since the abuse took place. \nThe Catholic church's opposition wore on Del. Eric Bromwell, a Baltimore County Democrat who had sponsored the bill before Wilson took it over. He withdrew the bill after just one year, having been inundated with criticism. \nBromwell rushed from another committee hearing to meet Wilson at the Judiciary Committee Wednesday afternoon. He embraced Wilson and told him he was proud of his work. \nBromwell said he was glad Wilson wouldn't have to give his gut-wrenching testimony again. \nThe state Senate approved the bill unanimously earlier on Wednesday. With Wednesday's committee vote, the full House of Delegates is expected to follow suit in the coming days. \nPerhaps even more important than the expanded legal rights for child abuse victims, Wilson said, is the message that the legislature is sending to them. \nEven if victims don't end up filing more lawsuits, they'll know that their representatives in Annapolis care about them, Wilson said. \n\"You want them to know they're not ignored,\" he said. \ntwitter.com/pwoodreporter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T03:15:21.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
