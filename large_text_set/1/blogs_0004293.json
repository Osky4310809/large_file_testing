I'm nearby and I hear it like it was right next to us,\" resident Konan Benoit told Reuters news agency by telephone as gunfire could be heard on the line. \nThe renegade soldiers have controlled the city of around a half million residents since taking up positions at key entry points early on Friday. \nThe army has sent reinforcements to Bouake but the defence minister said in a statement late on Friday that the government was prepared to listen to the soldiers' grievances. Mutinies also occurred in two of the West African nation's other main cities on Friday [Reuters] \nIt was not immediately clear what provoked the gunfire, but a member of the uprising said soldiers had seen what they considered suspicious movements outside the camp in Bouake. \n\"This is gunfire to discourage them,\" the unnamed soldier said. \nSimilar mutinies also occurred in two of the West African nation's other main cities on Friday as the movement appeared to spread.
