It could also cost millions of Americans their jobs. As self-driving systems are deployed in widespread use over the next decade, many of their first applications will be in commercial vehicles, and as these technologies become more robust, they will likely endanger the employment of millions of truckers and taxi drivers.\n-While there’s a shortage of workers who drive for a living today, government leaders are urging the Trump administration to prepare for a transition period when automation puts the jobs of more than 2.5 million truck drivers at risk. Two Republican governors outlined their concerns Sunday during a meeting with new Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n-“Autonomous vehicles are a tremendous opportunity, and at the same time, there’s this big-time workforce issue,” Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said. “We need to be thinking far enough ahead on that one, so that we don’t wind up creating a tremendous amount of economic hardship along the way there.”\n- - “ - “I’m very, very concerned about that, and very cognizant\n-of those challenges.” – Elaine Chao, DOT Secretary\n- - ” - -His comments came during the closing session of the National Governors Association’s winter meetings in Washington D.C. , and the echoed those made by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, who expressed hope that Chao would examine a swath of issues that arise as byproducts of automation, including upheaval in the insurance industry. He wants to partner with the DOT on examining retraining options for displaced workers.\n-“What this can do for truck drivers, we need to be looking farther out as to what are their career opportunities as we see these autonomous vehicles emerge, and how do we make sure we’re planning far enough ahead so we don’t create job-loss opportunities for people.”\n- Elaine Chao, Department of Transportation Secretary\n-The nation’s unemployment rate remains steady 4.8 percent, per the latest numbers issued by the Department of Labor in January, and autonomous trucking isn’t an immediate threat to its stability. More than 1.6 million Americans are employed driving tractor-trailers and other heavy trucks while more 826,000 more drive light trucks or are employed in delivery services. But the number of companies pursuing to self-driving truck technology, including Otto, Peloton, and Embark, is growing. On Tuesday, Starsky Robotics announced its intention to join what’s become a lucrative chase. Otto conducted a fully autonomous beer delivery last October that entailed a 120-mile drive along Interstate 25 in Colorado.\n-In her new role with the DOT, Chao may have a unique vantage point for balancing the Trump administration’s intent to promote innovation and strip regulation with the desire to preserve blue-collar jobs. She served as the Secretary of Labor for eight years under George W. Bush. Chao kept her comments on the issue brief Sunday, but did signal there may be a federal role in ushering workers from jobs with fading employment prospects into those more geared toward an autonomous age.\n-“I’m very, very concerned about that, and very cognizant of those challenges,” she told Baker. “So we do have to transition people, and we do have to keep this in mind.”\n- - Self-Driving Truck Makes 120-Mile Beer Delivery, But There’s A Concern - Federal Government Issues New Automated Vehicle Policy - Document Suggests Otto Test Driver’s Don’t Keep Foot On Pedal - -Trump may be the one who confronts the reality of job losses caused by automated driving technologies, but the Obama administration saw it on the horizon. A White House report issued in December 2016 noted that self-driving systems would have a mixed effect on overall employment, boosting the productivity of some workers who could benefit from extra time in their cars. But others would face the loss of jobs, and even if they could retrain, they may not attain the same level of wages.\n-“A share of workers in a few isolated occupations—truck drivers and delivery service drivers, in particular—currently enjoy a wage premium over others in the labor market with the same level of educational attainment,” the report said. “They may not be able to regain this wage premium if displaced.”\n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T18:41:55.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
