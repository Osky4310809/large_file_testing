It plunged into a nearby ditch after detaching from the truck. \nOperatives of Lagos State Fire Service and Lagos Emergency (LASEMA) removed the tanker from the scene. \nThey barred vehicular movement until the clean-up of the road. \nLagos State Fire Service Director Rasaq Fadipe said the spillage was diluted and mopped before the tanker was recovered from the ditch. \nLASEMA boss Adesina Tiamuyu blamed the driver’s carelessness for the accident. \nHe said the driver knew the truck had brake issues but still tried to manage it to Ibadan. \n“The tanker lost its brakes while descending Otedola Bridge and drove into the slope. When we were informed, we came in here. What we first did was to first recover the head, trans-loaded the fuel and finally recovered the tanker at the back. We have opened up the road. What we want to do is to appeal to motorists to ensure that their vehicles are in good condition because this one had brake failure and from what we gathered, he managed it even to this point so he knew the brake was bad. That is usually what we have been facing in the hands of articulated vehicles’ drivers. We want to appeal to their unions to talk to their members to ensure that their vehicles are in good condition before putting them on the road and also to make sure that their drivers are well trained. Some of these drivers lack basic driving technique.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:25:48.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
