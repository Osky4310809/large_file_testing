Many stone weapons were also discovered in the vicinity which was seen as sign of early human life. The state of Chhattisgarh is also home to many rock-art paintings which seemed to be among the oldest in the world. \nHowever, the exploration of the state’s rich history has largely been hindered due to decades of Maoist insurgency. The left-wing rebels have often been blamed for sabotaging the development of Chhattisgarh, which has also got one of the largest mineral reserves in India.
