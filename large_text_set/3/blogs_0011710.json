Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki \nAccording to Obaseki, “We have hired a specialist with a lot of experience to reorganise the Edo Transport Management Agency. It will be part of the Edo Jobs Scheme. We will be recruiting traffic officers, but we will screen them very carefully and train them in a government facility we have set up.” \nHe explained that the training would be rigorous, after which the traffic officers would be deployed to the streets to organise and control traffic. \nOn how traffic offenders would be dealt with, Governor Obaseki said the government was making plans with the judiciary to deliver swift judgment to traffic offenders, adding: “We will have mobile courts and some magistrate courts designated for prosecuting traffic offenders. \n“From the measures we have put in place, once we roll out the process this month, we should be able to put a halt to traffic menace in the state. We have people who are already working on trying to develop a masterplan for transportation in the city and eventually in the state.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T04:56:32.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
