"highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "The Most Exciting Austin Restaurant Openings This Winter What’s opening between late December 2016 to early March 2017 and beyond share 2016 is almost over, and with that, it’s time to look ahead to the new year with a fresh slate of restaurants and bars ready to open in Austin. After a year full of switcheroos, shutters, and expansions, there are some exciting big new restaurants to keep track of. There’s Philip Speer’s return in the form of neighborhood-friendly Bonhomie , Texas-influenced izakaya from the Ramen Tatsu-ya team with Kemuri , the reinvented beloved Texas fried chicken chain with J.T. Youngblood (Lenoir chef Todd Duplechan’s involvement doesn’t hurt), wood-fired fare from a San Francisco chef at Pitchfork Pretty , two new coffee shops, and plenty more. And, as usual, there are the typical holdovers from spring, summer, and fall, due to permitting woes and construction delays. 2017 is shaping up to be a good dining and drinking year for Austin. See an impending restaurant opening missing below? Send it through the tipline . This guide will be updated throughout the season as details change and places open. Bonhomie Bonhomie/Instagram Philip Speer is back with his new restaurant Bonhomie. With a name that means “friendliness,” it’s to serve as a relaxed neighborhood spot (think French bistro meets American diner). Sean McCusker, who founded New Orleans’ hit restaurant Sylvain, brought over sommelier Darrin Ylisto as the beverage director, and Speer roped Jared Ferguson, who helped him with cocktail bar Garage’s menu; he also spent time in Uchi and San Francisco’s Lazy Bear. Expect French onion eclairs, a killer burger, and wonderful desserts from the pastry-minded chef. Location: 5350 Burnet Road, Allandale Major Players: Philip Speer, Sean McCusker, Darrin Ylisto, Jared Ferguson Projected Opening: Rendering of Kemuri Rendering: McCray & Co. The Ramen Tatsu-ya team decided to switch things up for its third project in Austin with a Texas-influenced izakaya. Taking inspiration from the former bones of Live Oak Barbecue (whose smokey walls will remain standing), there will be smoked meats (naturally), sharable dishes, cocktails, and more. Location: 2713 East 2nd Street, Holly Major Players: Tatsu Aikawa, Takuya Matsumoto Projected Opening: Winter 2016/2017 JT Youngblood's/Facebook The beloved Texas fried chicken chain was long gone, but thanks to a group of Austin restaurateurs, it’s coming back next year. Dubbed J.T. Youngblood’s, the restaurant will focus on all things poultry with fried and rotisserie chicken, paired with sides, pies, yeast rolls, soft serve, and shakes. To take the edge off, there are tapped wine, beer, and cocktails. Currently, it’s hiring for a bunch of positions.. Smartly, there will be a takeout window for those Mueller picnics. (Stiles and Duplechan are teaming up for a new Southern-focused smoked meats restaurant out in Dripping Springs later this year.) Location: 1905 Aldrich Street, Suite #120, Mueller Major Players: Jeff Weinberger, Todd Duplechan, Shane Stiles, Jeff Haber Projected Opening: Rendering of Pitchfork Pretty Rendering: Greig Percy Collaborative The long-in-the-works restaurant from Seth Baas is almost here. The A-frame house with an earthy feel (vines, exposed wood) will serve up Hill Country-inspired wood-fired cuisine with produce and meats with the tease of potential fried chickens specials, too. And yes, it turns out San Francisco chef Max Snyder is indeed joining the restaurant, after leaving Old Bus Tavern for Austin. Location: 2708 East Cesar Chavez Major Players: Seth Baas, Max Snyder Projected Opening: Rendering of Kuneho Rendering: A Parallel Architecture Chef Paul Qui's revamp of his flagship restaurant is still coming, changing the angle into a Japanese eatery, creating what it refers to as \"perfect bites.\" The renovations include adding a sushi bar and an attached bar now-named The Borough. Location: 1600 East 6th Street Major Players: Paul Qui Hops & Grain/Facebook It’s all about kolaches, klobasnek, and beer when Batch opens next month. Making the baked goods is Jasmine Jones, the former Lenoir chef who now runs catering company I Knead That. Look out for ones made with Micklethwait Craft Meats. The bakery will include a taproom, beer garden, and retail shop. Location: 3220 Manor Road Major Players: Noah Lit, Josh Lit, Jasmine Jones Projected Opening: Rendering of Vigilante Rendering: Vigilante/Official Vigilante will become a board game lovers’ haven, where everything is built for activity, from customized tables with tons of modifications (food trays, wifi, focused spotlights) to food that won’t interfere with playing. There are plans for special events, including a brunch one, and guests can take advantage of private dining rooms hidden behind bookcases. Location: 7010 Easy Wind Drive, Crestview Major Players: Preston Swincher, Phillip Kromer, Zack Daschofsky, Derrick Hoang Projected Opening: Friday, Spokesman Nadia Chaudhury/EATX Bike-friendly cafe Spokesman will fulfill its duty as the neighborhood coffee shop and roastery as part of creative mixed-use development The Yard. With a \"quality first\" motto, coffee will be roasted in-house, there will be a highly-curated beer tap wall, and food. The pair knows their stuff, they come from breweries and coffee (ABGB, Wright Bros. Brew & Brew). Location: 440 East St. Elmo Road Major Players: C.J. West, Trey Ramirez Projected Opening: Pizzeria Sorellina Apis/Official Apis’ pizzeria is still forthcoming, slinging Neapolitan-style pies, cured meats, and cheese right on the grounds out in Spicewood. Taylor Hall and Adam Brick are taking their time to make sure everything is right, from charcuterie that has been curing for a while to making as many cheeses as they can, as is the way for the restaurant. Location: 23526 Highway 71 West, Spicewood Major Players: Taylor Hall, Adam Brick Projected Opening: Early 2017 Rendering of Stone House Coffee Rendering: Stone House Coffee/Official The historic Dawson Stone House will become a cafe thanks to FBR Management, with building changes approved by the Historic Landmark Commission. Look out for Cuvee coffee, beer, pastries, gelato, and an on-site food truck to be determined. Location: 1105 South Lamar Boulevard Major Players: FBR Management Native’s plywood Nadia Chaudhury/EATX Austin will get a decidedly stylish take on hostels when Native opens in the East Side, right off the highway. As part of the project, there is the lounge-like lobby bar with drinks concocted by former Star Bar manager Nathan Nyberg (think classic cocktails) and coffee. The restaurant will be helmed by chef Virginia Pharr, who ran Hard Luck Lounge's now shuttered trailer Lady Luck. She’ll whip up a short diner-inspired menu, which’ll include housemade candy bars. Food will be served at all hours of the day. Yes, the motto is still \"curating a culture of fuck yes.\" Location: 807 East 4th Street, East Side Major Players: Michael Dickson, Antonio Madrid, Will Steakley, Virginia Pharr, Nathan Nyberg Projected Opening: Rendering of PS 35 Rendering: PS 35/Official For SMGB Hospitality’s next trick (after opening East Side Chinese restaurant Old Thousand this week), it will tackle New York-style pizza up in Round Rock. This is made easier with the help of former 40 North pizza slinger chef Clint Elmore. The spot will include plenty of outdoor, as well as beer, cocktails, family-style Italian entrees, soft-serve gelato, and games. Location: 1500 Interstate 35 Frontage Road #35, Round Rock, 78681 Major Players: SMGB Hospitality Group, Clint Elmore Projected Opening: All Coverage of PS 35 Also tracking: — Still not much is known about Shawn Cirkiel's next project, Jugo, is a juice bar right smack dab in the middle of downtown Austin, but it’s set to open within the first four months of 2017.
