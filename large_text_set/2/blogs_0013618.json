This solution not only revitalizes the space but also protects existing buildings from the sun, improving their thermal conditions.\n\n\nFrom the architects: The construction is located in the industrial complex of Caleras de San Cucao, in Llanera , an industrial area dominated by the presence of buildings connected to the project.\n© Marcos Morilla \nAfter constructing a staircase that connects the two levels of the quarry, a previously unused area, visible from both levels, housing several small structures forms part of the new walkway. This was the reason why it was necessary to create something that is visually attractive to visitors.\n© Marcos Morilla \nInstead of setting up a new building to house the tasks currently associated with booths, it was decided to opt for a more economical and sustainable solution. Keeping each of them without altering their shape or appearance but hiding their presence beneath a raised garden, covering them visually and at the same time protecting them from the sun, would improve their thermal conditions.\n© Marcos Morilla \nA complex structure of metal strips forms a weaved pattern where planters of different depths are distributed randomly, creating a composition when viewed from both in front and above. When it rains, the planters, which are like a kind of flowerpot made of geotextiles and perforated bottoms, filter the water. \n© Marcos Morilla \nThe choice of the different plant species, in collaboration with the gardener responsible for the maintenance of the industrial complex, was firstly made keeping in mind the ability to adapt to a hostile environment, with strong thermal fluctuations, frequent fog and solid particles in suspension. Secondly, it was chosen to take advantage of different flowering periods and shades of the leaves to generate some colorful contrasts. \n© Longo + Roldán Architects \nWe couldn’t use plants on the pillars to support the new staircase due to the lack of sun, so we’ve made a dry garden comprised of a sample of the minerals used in one of the companies located in the enclosure.\n© Longo + Roldán Architects © Longo + Roldán Architects © Longo + Roldán Architects © Longo + Roldán Architects © Longo + Roldán Architects Architects:  Longo + Roldán Architects  (Víctor Longo Valdés + Ester Roldán Calvo)\nLocation: San Cucao, Llanera , Asturias , Spain\nProject Date: 2012\nConstruction Date: 2013\nClient: Caleras de San Cucao, S.L.\nConstruction company: Estructuras Metálicas El Rubio, S.A.\nPhotographs: Marcos Morilla\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:02:27.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
