Here are two ways to power through less-intense pain using only your mind. Advertisement \nWhen the feeling of pain first washes over you, David Tauben , clinical professor in the Department of Pain Medicine at the University of Washington, says it’s important to recognize the difference between danger and damage. Damage you can work through, but danger requires immediate medical attention. If you’re only dealing with damage, like a stubbed toe, nasty paper cut, or bruised elbow, take a deep breath and calm yourself. Once you’re calm, Tauben explains, you can try self-hypnosis: \nThink of a nice place where you’re safe, and go to that place in your mind’s eye. You have to train yourself to be in a calm, comfortable place physically or emotionally and practice that feeling when things are going well, so that when things aren’t going well, you can get back to it. \nFor example, your safe place could be a beach. Think of the smells, the sound of the waves, and the feeling of a gentle sea breeze against your body. The more sense you can bring in the better. \nIf that doesn’t work, distract yourself. Tauben says that active engagement in challenges can help you override the pain you’re feeling. Play a game on your phone or dive into some work. As long a it’s challenging it will help some. Your mind and body switch focus and devote your mental resources to the new experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:48:22.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
