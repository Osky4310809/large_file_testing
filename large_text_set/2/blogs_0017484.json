GIF via Vimeo \nYukai, a Central Saint Martins grad, has made editorial illustrations, GIFs, and videos for clients ranging from Adobe Systems to and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to The New York Times and WIRED . She has been featured in film and illustration festivals like Illustrated in Germany, Annecy International Film Festival in France, the UK's World Illustration Awards, and the American International Motion Art Awards. \nHer prowess is evident in the new video. Each frame's balance of color, motion, and rhythm furthers understanding of the concepts Hofeldt lays out.
