We are going to propose to reduce foreign aid and we are going to propose to spend that money here.” \n“So, I think that some of the proposals that you’ll see by March 16 will be some fairly dramatic reductions in foreign aid.” \nWhen asked if there were any specific countries that might be seeing cuts, Mulvaney responded that “a lot of our foreign aid doesn’t necessarily get targeted to a specific country. So when we talk about changing a particular aid program, it may have impact in various different nations, but that overriding message is fairly straightforward.”   \nYou can see his comments here: \nLiberals always say that foreign aid takes up a small percentage of our budget and shouldn’t be touched. On the other hand, when Trump proposed building a border wall — estimated at $21 billion by the Department of Homeland Security, according to Reuters — we suddenly don’t have the money for it. \nWhile Mulvaney didn’t mention any specific country or organization that might be targeted, one might assume the Palestinian Authority could be on the list. The Trump administration had already frozen a $221 million payment to the PA approved by the Obama administration on the former president’s last day in office, the Times of Israel reported.
