If you come on television and claim women love to be abused than you are as culpable as the one who commits the actual abuse.

Karachi Eat Festival was criticised for their “families only” policy but instances like the ones at the Atif Aslam concert on Saturday show us why such policies are necessary in the country that we live in. \nAll men may not be rapists but if you set your male privilege aside, you can see how women feel threatened by all men considering how common instances of sexual harassment are in Pakistan. \nA woman should not be made to feel like she can be assaulted any minute if she is out in public or having a good time at a concert. I hope we can all agree that any men who commit these actions are the worst kind of human beings but as men if we want to truly help create a better society there is so much more that we need to do. \nEmpathy demands us to see things from the perspective of the woman. It is not about being protective of your friends and family in public or hanging rapists from the streets but it is about assessing your words and actions each day to fight rape culture. \nIt is about realising that it is never the victim’s fault . Nobody blames a murdered person for their own murder then why do we blame the person being raped for the rape ? \nWe only make their agony worse by using language like “ izzat loot li ” (respect is taken away) – a woman should not be made to feel shameful for being the victim of a crime. She should not be made to feel unchaste or unsuitable for marriage if she suffers a sexual assault. Photo: Screenshot \nIt is extremely brave of women to speak about instances of sexual violence, like the assault at the Atif concert on Saturday, and they should be lauded for it. As men, the least we can do to support them is shut down any conversation of victim blaming or victim shaming we see men around us do. \nLet’s fight the rape culture to create a better society for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T20:37:43.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
