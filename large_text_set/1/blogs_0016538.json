Then things slowed down a bit. However, over the past several days, activity has picked back up. \nA new and more informative synopsis was released on Friday. A sample of the menacing score being composed by Marco Beltrami was released yesterday. And today, director James Mangold has released a trio of high-resolution, behind-the-scenes photographs he took of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Dafne Keen as X-23, and Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier. \nCheck out the three photos in our gallery below. \nOh, if you happen to love photography, you'll want to head on over to Mangold's Twitter account . He's been providing a wealth of information on the cameras, settings, and lens he used while snapping each photograph. He has also been answering questions from his camera-loving followers. \nIn the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces. \nThe film stars Hugh Jackman ( X-Men: Days of Future Past ) as Logan/Wolverine and Patrick Stewart ( Star Trek: The Next Generation ) as Charles Xavier/Professor X. The cast also includes Boyd Holbrook ( Gone Girl ), Richard E. Grant ( Game of Thrones ), Stephen Merchant ( Movie 43 ), Eriq La Salle ( ER ), Elise Neal ( Scream 2 ), Elizabeth Rodriguez ( Orange is the New Black ), and Dafne Keen ( The Refugees ). \nThe film is being directed by James Mangold ( The Wolverine ), based on a script by Michael Green ( American Gods ) and David James Kelly ( Mind Mgmt ). \nLogan opens in theaters on March 3, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T13:51:34.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
