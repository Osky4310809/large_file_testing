It’s the end of the line for Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) and his work on America’s first transcontinental railroad, and the final push to finish brings with it a reckoning for Bohannon and the men standing in his path: the bloodthirsty Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl), the mercenary Chang (Byron Mann) and the rapacious Thomas Durant (Colm Meaney). \nOn average during its fourth season, “Hell on Wheels” delivered 3.5 million viewers per episode, including 1.3 million adults 25-54, according to Nielsen’s Live+7 estimates. The show is consistently one of the top scripted originals on Saturday nights and is currently the No. 1 show on cable and No. 2 on all of television for its timeslot. \n“Hell on Wheels” is executive produced by showrunner John With; Paul Kurta; Michael Rosenberg; Jeremy Gold, EVP, Endemol Shine Studios; and Mike Frislev and Chad Oakes from Nomadic Pictures. Entertainment One Television’s (eOne) Debra Curtis, SVP Current Programming, and David Shafer, VP Production, oversee production in partnership with producers. eOne in the worldwide distributor and licensed television rights in Europe to Endemol Shine. \nSpanning the years 1865 to 1890, “The American West” will show how — in the aftermath of the Civil War — the United States transforms into the “land of opportunity.” Viewers will be transported into the violent world of cowboys, Indians, outlaws and law men in the eight-episode limited event series, which will air Saturdays at 10 following “Hell on Wheels” starting June 11. \nIn “American West,” little-known stories of Western legends such as Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull will air along with exclusive interviews with notable names from classic Western films, including Redford, James Caan, Burt Reynolds, Tom Selleck, Kiefer Sutherland, Mark Harmon and Ed Harris. \n“The American West” is executive produced by Emmy Award-winning Stephen David Entertainment and Robert Redford and Laura Michalchyshyn with Sundance Productions.
