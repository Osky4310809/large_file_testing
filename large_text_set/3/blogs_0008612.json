Jeff Zrebiec of the Baltimore Sun was the first to report the move, and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport confirmed it. The 31-year-old Webb spent eight seasons with the Ravens, registering 13 interceptions as a cornerback and safety. Webb switched his primary position to safety in 2016 and started 16 games, producing to the tune of 73 tackles, five passes defended, one interception and one sack. The Ravens announced the signing of safety Tony Jefferson on Thursday, and with safety Eric Weddle already on the roster, Webb became expendable. Webb's best season came in 2011 when he picked off five passes as a cornerback, but his versatility could make him a commodity on the free-agent market. Do-everything defensive back Micah Hyde landed a five-year, $32.5 million contract with the Buffalo Bills on Thursday, according to Rapoport , and Webb's similar ability to play both safety and cornerback should generate interest as well.
