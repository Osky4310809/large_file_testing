Winners were announced Monday. \n“Cocooned by a swirling ball of frenzied glassfish, nature decided in a matter of seconds this diver’s fate…as well as his outfit for several minutes!” Wu wrote in his description of the photo. \n“However, it was the instinctive nature of the predating school of larger fish that corralled the glassfish from the reef below into mid water where they all came upon this diver. \n“The blanket of glassfish grazed against my whole body and face as they swarmed around me to avoid the incessant torpedoing attacks of the hunters.” \nOcean Art is said to be one of the most prestigious nature photo contests in the world with photographers from 60 countries submitting some of the best underwater photographs of the year. \nOcean Art shared a few other winning images with GrindTV: “Looking.” Photo: Courtesy of Joaquin Gutierrez/ Ocean Art Competition \nFirst place, portrait, Joaquin Gutierrez, “Looking,” shot in Tenerife, Canary Island, Spain. The photographer’s description: \n“Marine drift lines carry all kinds of marine animals, jellyfish, gelatinous animals, fish farms and in many cases species that take advantage of these lines for their food. This time these two roosters feed on a piece of jellyfish or some gelatinous species. When I saw their looks through the viewfinder and being able to capture this photograph made me very excited.” “Our Enchanted forest.” Photo: Courtesy of Lawrence Alex Lu/ Ocean Art Competition \nFirst place, compact macro, Lawrence Alex Wu, “Our enchanted Forest,” shot in Anilao, Philippines. The photographer’s description: \n“Yes, this is a marine animal and if you asked, `What is it?’, then you’ve asked the same question as everyone else! What’s more important though, is where is it?…And the answer is that it is from our Oceans! \n“Part of our heritage, and one that we need to save! Unrevealing as it is, this 2cm forest like structure is the inside of a Common Sea Squirt, Class: Ascidiacea, subphylum Urochordata…from our Magical World underwater!” “Got it!” Photo: Courtesy of Christian Miller/ Ocean Art Competition \nFirst place, pool-conceptual, Christian Miller, “Got it!”, shot in Fitzroy Island, Queensland, Australia. Photographer’s description: \n“Since 2010 I am involved in Turtle Rescue & Rehabilitation and remain Director for a facility in Far North Queensland. When we had to build a larger and better hospital I tried to make my photographic skills of use to raise awareness but also funds to be able to operate. When you care for Turtles there are three moments that make you happy. First when they start eating, second when they come up for a breath, and lastly when they get released back to the wild. This Turtle in the images we called Eva. She had a very I would say cheeky character and was one of the few Turtles in care that posed for my camera. I wanted to document and tell a story about the individual Turtles and add some real drama to it. All I did was to add some motion blur to the background, enhance the colors and create more contrast by using dodge and burn techniques.” “Blue Lasso.” Photo: Courtesy of Matty Smith/ Ocean Art Competition \nFirst place, wide-angle and best of show, Matty Smith, “Blue Lasso,” shot in Bushrangers Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Photographer’s description: \n“The Physalia Utriculus, also known as the Pacific Man of War or Bluebottle, uses its deadly blue tendril to paralyze prey of small pelagic fish and crustaceans. Once its meal has been immobilized, the tentacle is quickly retracted to draw the victim up the stomachs where it will be digested. There are often hundreds of these animals washed into the bays near my home over night during the correct wind and current conditions. A lucky composition and beautiful illumination highlights the beauty of this elegant predator. It was one of those rare moments when it all came together for me, the fortunate photographer, I knew I had just witnessed something very special.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:25:17.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
