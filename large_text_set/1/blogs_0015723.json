Since November 8, there’s been an uptick in reported harassment and hate attacks against marginalized groups all over the country. The Southern Poverty Law Center counted more than 400 hate incidents in the first week after the election alone. Two weeks later, that number jumped to 700 .\nSome Americans feel helpless in the face of what’s happening to the country. But, if you witness one of these attacks, there are ways to intervene.\nCollective Action for Safe Spaces and ThinkProgress have collected some tools so you can help, if you feel that you can do so safely.\nWatch the video above to learn more.\nTranscript: \nHARASSER 1: Speak English. You’re in America.\nHARASSER 2: Black lives don’t matter. There ain’t no proof.\nHARASSER 3: She’s a Middle Eastern terrorist and she will probably get deported.\nJESSICA RAVEN, Collective Action for Safe Spaces: It’s 2017 and people are scared, but sometimes, as a bystander, there are ways that you can help.\nHere are 4 ways you can be an active bystander and respond to harassment:\n1. Be Direct\nTalk to the target\nKRYSTAL ATHA, Collective Action for Safe Spaces: Are you okay? \nDo you need help? \nRAVEN: Or the harasser.\nATHA: What are you doing? \nIt looks like they don’t want to talk. \nRAVEN: 2. Distract\nDivert attention away from the situation by distracting the harasser or the target.\nATHA: Do you know what time it is? \nExcuse me, where’s the nearest metro? \nRAVEN: Or, if you feel safe, use your body to create a physical barrier between the harasser and their target.\n3. Delegate\nIf you don’t feel safe, you can find someone who does.\nATHA: Does the target have friends nearby? \nIs there someone who works there? \nRAVEN: 4. Delay\nIf you can’t intervene in the moment, offer support to the target after the incident.\nATHA: Is there anything I can do to help? \nYou deserve to be treated with respect. \nRAVEN: These are some of the many strategies for responding to harassment as an active bystander.\nCheck out Collective Action for Safe Spaces for more ways to help or to support their work. \nSee someone being harassed?
