No other Big Ten coach besides Crean won two outright league titles in the previous nine years. But the 2016 Big Ten Coach of the Year was still fired last week after finishing 7-11 in the league and missing the NCAA Tournament . That he lost two starters (OG Anunoby, Colin Hartman) to season-ending injuries wasn’t enough to generate patience from either IU’s big boosters or athletic director Fred Glass. \nLSU has also had discussions with VCU’s Will Wade, a source confirmed to CBS Sports. Wade has led the Rams to back-to-back NCAA Tournaments. His career record -- from two years at Chattanooga and two years at VCU -- is 91-45 overall, 55-15 in league games. If he were to leave VCU, he’d be the fourth straight coach to win and bolt for a Power-5 job -- joining Jeff Capel (Oklahoma), Anthony Grant (Alabama) and Shaka Smart (Texas).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T01:22:24.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
