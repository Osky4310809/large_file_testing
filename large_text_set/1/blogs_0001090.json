But to compensate for that SRK didn't share just one, but two new posters of Raees. \nFinally, we see lead actress of the film, Mahira Khan, in one poster. The photo is captioned, \" Tu shama hai toh yaad rakhna... Main bhi hoon parwana \". We are eagerly waiting to see more of Mahira and Shah Rukh as the two looked amazing together in the trailer. Tu shama hai toh yaad rakhna... Main bhi hoon parwana... pic.twitter.com/d0Y002yKyT — Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) January 2, 2017 \nThe second poster has SRK in a bohemian avatar. The picture is captioned #OZaalima, and can be a look from one of Raees' upcoming song. — Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) January 2, 2017 \nWe just cannot wait for the film to release on 25th January.
