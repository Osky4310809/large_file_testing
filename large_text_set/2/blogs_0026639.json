While I was a somberly walking around my neighborhood alone waiting for the end of the world, other more optimistic individuals might've been eagerly anticipating all of the new and exciting cinematography that the millennium was about to usher in. In this supercut from The Art of Film , we get to see some of the greatest images that over 100 films had to offer in the last 16 years. Check it out below! \nIt's impossible (too much work) to include every great film that came out in the last 16 years, but the supercut does a great job of including a wide range of different genres with all types of visual style, from the desolate and horrifying Saw to the vivid colorscape of Up . It was also nice to see selections from films that were more than compositional masterpieces, but were also kinetic powerhouses, like Mad Max: Fury Road and Kill Bill . \nThe supercut definitely inspires us to appreciate the cinematography of the first 16 years of this millennium, but it also gets us excited to see what the next 16 years have in store. \nWhich shots would you have liked to have seen in this supercut? What is your all-time favorite shot from this millennium?
