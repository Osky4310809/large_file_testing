Now, the US president may have doomed a threatened bumblebee. \nAn executive order freezing new regulations could push the rusty patched bumblebee towards extinction, environmental groups claim. The 60-day pause on all federal regulations that have yet to be implemented – which includes the bumblebee protection – will review “questions of fact, law, and policy they raise”, according to the White House memo. \nThe bumblebee was the first bee of any kind in the contiguous US to ever be declared as endangered , with the listing decided during the final days of Barack Obama’s administration. Trump’s halt on new regulations came just one day before protections were formally put in place for the crucial pollinator. \nThe rusty patched bumblebee was once abundant across 28 states from Connecticut to South Dakota. However, the widespread loss of grasslands and prairies, pesticide use and a parasitic fungus have taken a severe toll on the black and yellow striped insect. \nThe species is now found in scattered populations in the midwest, having suffered an 87% population slump since the mid-1990s. Conservationists fear the pause in protection for the bee could seal its demise, especially if the regulation was delayed further. Is America's most common pesticide responsible for killing our bees?

Listing the bee as endangered will help us mobilize partners and focus resources on finding ways right now to stop the decline. \n“Pollinators are small but mighty parts of the natural mechanism that sustains us and our world. Without them, our forests, parks, meadows and shrublands, and the abundant, vibrant life they support, cannot survive, and our crops require laborious, costly pollination by hand.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T20:06:34.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
