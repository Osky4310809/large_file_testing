Sa Monaco lang ako, ma’am. Basta may view lang ako doon sa beach tapos may teleskopyo ako, okay na ako (Even in Monaco with a view of the beach and a telescope in hand),” the 71-year-old President said. \nMonaco is a sovereign city-state and microstate, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is known for its upscale casinos, luxurious hotels, boutiques, nightclubs and restaurants, yacht-lined harbor and prestigious Grand Prix motor race, which runs through Monaco’s streets once a year. \nMagdalo party-list Rep. Gary Alejano last week filed an impeachment complaint against Duterte based on the President’s alleged culpable violation of the Constitution by engaging in bribery, betrayal of public trust, graft and corruption, as well as other high crimes. \nBut Duterte shrugged off the impeachment complaint, saying that his winning the presidency in the May 9, 2016 polls was pure destiny for him. \n“Wala sa akin ’yang impeachment, impeachment. I go by the rules of destiny. What made me the… What gave me the presidency was pure destiny, if you consider all the things that happened along the way,” he added.   \nThe House of Representatives, which will decide on the impeachment complaint, is controlled by Duterte’s allies.
