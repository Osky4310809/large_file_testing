Adams to have the most hashtag goals first Valentine’s Day as a married couple ever.\nAnd they did! Sort of. Kind of. Let us explain.\nBellisario has been in Brazil for the past few days taking in the sites — and taking some amazing photos — with her Pretty Little Liars costar Ian Harding and her best friend, Lulu Brud. Adams, meanwhile, is stuck back home, likely filming Suits in Toronto. Sigh .\nBut lest anyone accuse him of being a neglectful Valentine, Adams made sure to send roses and mimosas to Bellisario’s Rio De Janiero hotel first thing in the morning.\nA valentine from a world away. I'm ready to come home now please. \nA post shared by Troian Bellisario (@sleepinthegardn) on Feb 14, 2017 at 4:20am PST \nA Valentine’s Day with no date pressure, mimosas in bed, gorgeous roses, two best friends, and the beaches of Rio right outside your doorstep?!\nYep, Bellisario wins. Again.\nThe Girl from Ipanema goes walking. (Guys I had to do it) \nA post shared by Troian Bellisario (@sleepinthegardn) on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:34am PST \nOf course we hope that the couple finds time to celebrate together once they’re both back in Los Angeles, but for now, we just love that they’re able to take care of each other whilst also living their best lives separately. That’s what true romance is all about.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:21:36.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
