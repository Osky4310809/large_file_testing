The brave bull fighter’s entire anus was almost ripped in half after the animal’s horn penetrated his delicate derrière and needed surgery to stitch it back together. “It is a serious and deep goring approximately 30 centimeters,” one of the paramedics in the scene, Felipe Sanchez, described the incident to the Daily Star . Dr. Rafael Vázquez Bayod, who was in charge of Romero’s surgery, said the piercing horn left a “very, very serious damage to his anorectal region.” “It completely destroyed the anal sphincter and very seriously damaged the rectum,” he noted. But luckily for the 38-year-old daredevil, he is now on the path to recovery and is expected to be completely healed in the coming weeks. However, it seems that the gruesome incident did not tarnish his willingness to tangle with the rampaging beasts anew, as he reportedly wants to return to action upon his recovery. “I have faith and hope in returning to feel and show that I can be someone important in the fiesta brava,” he told the news outlet. Although heavily frowned upon by numerous animal conservationist groups around the world, bullfighting remains as one of the most popular attractions in Latin American countries. Those who are brave enough to taunt the often 2000-pound beasts are celebrated as heroes and seen as “macho” in most Latin America cultures.
