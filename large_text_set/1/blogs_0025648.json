But A Dying Breed was born that way: riding the red line from west to east on the London Underground. \nMy night work was as a junior producer at BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. I think I knew I’d write a fictionalised version of the show about half an hour after starting work there: there were too many characters, anecdotes and stories to resist. Some mornings, I’d get so involved with writing it all down that I’d end up in Epping. Other mornings, I’d be so bored by my own sleep-deprived ramblings that I’d fall asleep, again ending up in Epping. (Nice place by the way – leafy.) \nNot all my motives were good. I used my scribblings to settle scores. The short-armed and sour-breathed political correspondent who bawled me out for sitting at his desk on my first day? I would have my revenge – I would pin a version of him to the page the way a lepidopterist pins a chloroformed cabbage white to a corkboard. But as time went by and the number of notebooks grew, I began to think I might have something to say and that fiction would be the way to say it. \nThe news wire services provided by Reuters, AFP, PA and others dominated my working days and nights and it was one of these wires that provided the spark. Wire copy appeared at the top of every BBC news computer – story after story piling in from all over the world – and if a wire was urgent then a bolt of lightning symbol appeared alongside. It was easy to become obsessed with them and I did. \nUS Ohio Failed Execution, 5th lead Writethru. Judges halt second attempt at lethal injection after a two-and-a-half hour attempt fails to kill man. \nIraq Crime Wave. Kidnappers holding a teacher’s 10-year-old son gave him two days to find $90,000. When he could not pay they chopped off the boy’s head and hands and left the body parts at a city dump. \nThere were more stories than you knew what to do with, more stories than you could ever tell. As I watched, a new wire dropped. A flashed story from AP in Afghanistan, slugged BOMB BLAST KABUL. \nThis last story, the one I chose to place at the heart of the book, begins with an unremarkable bomb blast in an ordinary Afghan street but spreads and deepens until it becomes a conspiracy with the potential to bring down more than one government. Alongside that tale, the bigger question I wanted to look at was how we decide which stories are told and which are not. Who decrees what is newsworthy and what isn’t? And at a time when serious journalism is in retreat, with newspapers closing and broadcasters and print media shedding jobs, who will keep asking the awkward questions? \nMy answer was William Carver: an unloved, unlovable and unpredictable old hack. I don’t know an exact replica, but I’ve been lucky enough to work with journalists like him and the more I wrote about Carver, the more attached I got. As my working life became dominated by the various episodes in the ongoing war on terror, so did Carver’s. I sent him first to Iraq and then Afghanistan. I had him report the facts as he found them, witness the horrors and worry about the things we all worry about: how do you tell the truth in a time of war? How do the army, the secret intelligence services and mainstream media work together? How do we know what to believe? The best recent thrillers – review roundup Read more \nWith A Dying Breed optioned for television and William Carver proving popular, I’m working on his next adventure – one in which Carver gets to grips with a world where hyperbole trumps honesty and real news is locked in an existential battle with fake news. Extract \nCarver liked to spend time up on the roof, but only when the TV people were elsewhere. Given the number of different programmes and audiences the correspondents were serving, finding such quiet moments wasn’t easy, but William had found that between three and four in the morning he could have the roof to himself. The air was cleaner there than on the street and the view was impressive. William had picked his way through the black spaghetti of TV cabling, past the arc lights and satellite dishes, to his favourite spot. He sat on a wooden folding chair watching the broken city sleep. When he heard movement, he looked back over his shoulder and saw Vivian approaching. He gave a half-hearted wave; there was no avoiding her now. She stopped directly in front of him and switched on an arc light. William winced and shielded his eyes. ‘Hello.’ \n‘What you did to me earlier was unforgivable, William. I’ve worked with some wankers in this job, but you take the biscuit, you really do.’ \n‘Thanks.’ \n‘I didn’t ask for this job. Newsgathering assigned me to you and despite your reputation I agreed. Rob Mariscal approved it, you know that? In fact, he requested it.’ \nCarver looked up sharply, squinting against the glare. ‘Mariscal asked that you were assigned to me?’ \n‘Yeah. He probably wasn’t given much choice. You haven’t been on air in weeks, maybe months.’ \nCarver shrugged. This was technically true. He told anyone who asked that he was working on a long-form piece, something investigative, but that was as much detail as he would give. During his last few terms in Afghanistan, repeated requests from London for packages on a range of subjects – army recruitment, sniffer dogs, heroin reduction – were all met with the same surly silence. Hence Vivian, he supposed. A radio producer to help him produce some radio. ‘I’ve filed bulletin pieces. And some other stuff.’ \n‘All unusable, apparently.’ \n‘Unused, not unusable.’ William had heard that the intake desk in London referred to his occasional bulletin pieces as grimgrams – tales of everyday Afghan death and despair which no longer surprised anyone and were therefore, by definition, not news. ‘Anyway, I’m going to file something tonight, on this tailor’s shop bombing.’ More about the book \nA Dying Breed is the debut of former Today programme editor Peter Hanington. He is writing about what he knows (the BBC, Afghanistan) using Le Carré ’s post-cold war novels as a loose template. The result is thoughtful, atmospheric and grippingly plotted. If it has a flaw, it is Hanington’s romantic, occasionally pompous sense of Today’s importance – and of the importance to Today of middle-aged alcoholic white men, who do most of the clever, world-saving stuff here. One such man is maverick reporter William Carver, who suspects that the bombing of a tailor’s shop in Kabul, where he is based, is not the work of the Taliban but an organisation altogether closer to home – only to be blocked when he tries to pursue the story. Recognising that Carver is too unattractive to carry the novel, Hanington gives him a young, callow sidekick in producer Patrick. Whom Patrick is based on I’ve no idea, but any similarities between the novel’s plain-speaking programme editor, Rob Mariscal, and controversialist columnist Rod Liddle must be coincidental. – John O’Connell Buy the book", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T13:26:57.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
