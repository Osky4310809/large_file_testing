Hogan did respond to the criticism, and defended his record, saying, “I feel like I’m speaking out for my constituents every single day. I will continue to do so, but I think that people elected me to do a job here in Maryland, which we’re focused on. I didn’t run for president and they didn’t hire me to protest every day against everything they do in Washington.” \nHogan refused to support Trump in the general election, and publicly announced he voted for his father.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:24:21.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
