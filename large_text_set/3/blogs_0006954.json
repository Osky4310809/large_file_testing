I say to myself, ‘My life would be so much easier if I hadn’t won.’ \n“People look at me and think, ‘I wish I had her lifestyle, I wish I had her money.’ But they don’t realise the extent of my stress. \n“I have material things but apart from that my life is empty. What is my purpose in life?” \nJane added: “I think 18 should be the minimum age for winning the ­lottery, at the least. The current age of 16 is far too young.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T13:32:58.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
