Properly Manage Your Intake of Vitamins and Nutrients \nAs a general rule, I recommend getting the bulk of your nutrition from eating real food. That said, in some cases, taking specific nutrients may be therapeutically valuable or necessary, and can be far less toxic and less expensive than drug treatments. Moreover, in my view there are certain supplements that most people will benefit from taking. \nVitamin D3 (unless you're able to get sufficient amounts of sun exposure year-round) is at the top of that list, along with vitamin K2. Animal-based omega-3 fat, such as the fat found in krill oil, is another nutrient that most people simply don't get enough of. \nIf you still have not shifted away from processed foods, vitamin C may be worth considering, as processed foods will not provide you much of this vitamin. If you're not eating traditionally fermented foods, you'd also be wise to take a high quality probiotic supplement, and at the very least consider increasing your consumption of fresh vegetables, as the fiber provides important nourishment for beneficial bacteria in your gut that help calibrate your immune system. \nWhen selecting a high-quality dietary supplement, be sure it is as close as possible to its natural (whole food) form and follows industry standards for quality assurance including ISO 9001, ISO 17025, and Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certifications. \n10. Maintain Healthy Kidneys \nKidney stones can be truly agonizing. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent them from ever occurring. Recent research shows that an extract of a compound called hydroxycitrate from the Asian garcinia cambogia fruit, also known as Malabar tamarind , has the power to inhibit the growth of kidney stones. It can even be used to dissolve them after a stone has been generated. \nIf all goes as hoped, hydroxycitrate would be the most dramatic advance in treating kidney stones in three decades. However, rigorous trials in humans have not yet begun, so it's still too early to justify its use. In the meantime, to prevent keep your kidneys healthy and prevent kidney stones: Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration Limit your protein intake to one-half gram of protein per pound of lean body mass Avoid foods high in oxalate, such as Swiss chard, beets, tea, sweet potatoes, rhubarb, chocolate, okra, almonds and spinach if you're at high risk for kidney stones Make sure you're getting enough magnesium (especially if you avoid the high-oxalate foods above, which are also high in magnesium) \n11. Eat Magnesium Rich Foods \nMagnesium is vitally important for biological function and optimal health. If you're lacking in cellular magnesium, it can lead to the deterioration of your cellular metabolic function, which in turn can snowball into more serious health problems. Importantly, magnesium is vital for the optimization of your mitochondria. \nEating plenty of organic unprocessed foods tend to be your best bet, but since most soils have become severely depleted of nutrients, some magnesium experts believe virtually everyone needs to take supplemental magnesium. \nThe recommended daily allowance (RDA) is around 310 to 420 milligrams (mg) per day depending on your age and sex, although some researchers believe we may need as much as 600 to 900 mg/day for optimal health. One way to identify your ideal dose is to use your intestinal reaction as a marker. Start out by taking 200 mg of oral magnesium citrate per day, and gradually increase your dose until you develop slightly loose stools. \nWhen your body has too much magnesium it flushes it out, so in this way you can determine your own individual cutoff point. (Be sure to use magnesium citrate, as it's known for having a laxative effect.) \nWhen it comes to magnesium supplements, my personal preference is magnesium threonate, as it seems to be most efficient at penetrating cell membranes, including your mitochondria, which can help boost your energy level. It also penetrates your blood-brain barrier and may help improve memory. \nMost vegetables are very low in net carbs while being high in healthy fiber and the valuable vitamins and minerals your body needs for optimal health. However, some are more beneficial than others. Among the top performers are: Sprouts, especially watercress, broccoli sprouts and sunflower seeds Cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower and broccoli Leafy greens such as kale, beet greens, arugula, spinach, Swiss chard and collard greens Peppers, such as bell peppers, banana peppers, Poblano and chili peppers Certain root vegetables, specifically ginger, turmeric and onions \n13. Manage Your Sugar / Fructose Intake \nAs much as 40 percent of U.S. health care expenditures are for diseases directly related to the overconsumption of sugar. 7 One of the key mechanisms by which sugar promotes cancer and other chronic disease is by causing mitochondrial dysfunction. As mentioned earlier, sugar is not an ideal fuel as it creates far more ROS than fat. This generates free radicals, which in turn causes mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage along with cell membrane and protein impairment. \nI recommend reducing your total fructose intake to a maximum of 25 grams per day from all sources, including fruit. If you are insulin resistant, you'd do well to make your upper limit 15 grams per day. Cancer patients would likely be best served by even stricter limits. Moreover, I personally believe that most would benefit from reducing all non-fiber carbs (total carbs minus fiber), not just fructose, to less than 100 grams per day. \nThe easiest way to dramatically cut down on your sugar and fructose consumption is to switch to REAL foods, as most of the added sugar you end up with comes from processed foods. Other ways to cut down includes: Cutting back on the amount of sugar you add to your food and drink Using Stevia or Lo Han instead of sugar and/or artificial sweeteners. You can learn more about the best and worst of sugar substitutes in my previous article, \" Sugar Substitutes — What's Safe and What's Not \" Using fresh fruit in lieu of canned fruit or sugar for meals or recipes calling for a bit of sweetness Using spices instead of sugar to add flavor to your meal \n14. Do This to Help Fight Gray Hair \nYour hair color comes from pigment called melanin. With age, melanin is reduced, which is why your hair turns gray and, ultimately, white once there's no melanin left. \nIn 2016, researchers discovered a gene that accounts for about 30 percent of hair graying. The other 70 percent is likely due to factors such as age, toxic exposures, nutritional deficiencies and stress. To limit the grays: Avoid smoking Minimize oxidative stress by avoiding pollution and stress Eat a healthy antioxidant-rich diet Increase your vitamin B12 intake Normalize your weight \n15. Eliminate Gluten from Your Diet \nMounting research confirms that many people experience adverse reactions to gluten even if they test negative for celiac disease — an autoimmune disorder in which gluten must be avoided at all cost. This suggests gluten-sensitivity is a real problem, 8 and that gluten-free diets may benefit many, not just those with celiac. In one recent study, 9 , 10 people who reacted to gluten despite not having celiac disease were found to have leaky gut, which is likely what caused the immune activation. \nThe obvious treatment for celiac disease and gluten intolerance is a gluten-free diet, which means abstaining from any food that contains gluten. \nThis is largely because most is contaminated with Roundup used in the drying process, which tends to damage your intestinal cellular connections. However, keep in mind that while gluten-free has many advantages, just because a food is gluten-free does not automatically make it healthy. There are plenty of gluten-free junk foods out there, so be mindful of your choices. \n16. Exercise to Combat Osteoarthritis \nIf you have osteoarthritis — a degenerative form of arthritic joint disease — exercise is absolutely crucial to your well-being. The notion that exercise is detrimental to your joints is a misconception; there is no evidence to support this belief. Importantly, exercise can help reduce joint pain and make it easier for you to perform daily tasks. \nThat said, people with arthritis should be careful to avoid activities that aggravate joint pain, and any exercise that strains a significantly unstable joint. Aside from that, you can include a range of activities in your exercise program, just as any other exerciser would. \nWeight training, high-intensity cardio, stretching and core work can all be integrated into your routine according to your ability. The featured article also includes a series of flexibility exercises that will help strengthen your hips, which are suitable for those with hip osteoarthritis. \n17. Don't Let Political Stress Overtake You \nThis year's presidential election has unleashed an avalanche of anxiety and emotional distress, with more than 8 in 10 voters reporting feeling \"repulsed\" by the campaign. 11 Sadly, many have fallen into victim mentality, forgetting that the power of the individual is still alive and well even in this deeply flawed system. \nIt becomes yours by stepping OUTSIDE of the system with every decision and purchase you make. With every action you take, you also set the example for others to follow, thereby making you a change-agent within your own small circle of family, friends and acquaintances. In the end, our collective actions will create the changes that are so desperately needed. \nIf you don't like the state of the nation (or the world), stop eating processed and ultra-processed junk foods. Some may initially think this decision would have nothing to do with anything that is wrong in the world, but if you really give it some thought, you'll realize that the more independence you gain with your food, the more independence you will create in other areas as well. \n18. Save Time by Exercising More Efficiently \nWorkout intensity and workout volume are inversely proportional, so the greater the intensity, the less time you spend working out, and the less frequently you need to exercise. High intensity interval training (HIIT) can significantly reduce the amount of exercise you need to do, cutting your hour-long workouts down to 15 minutes once a week or less. \nMoreover, as intensity goes up, you also need longer recovery times in between sessions, so the frequency of your workouts also goes down. At most, you might be able to do HIIT three times a week. You can perform HIIT using a recumbent bicycle, a treadmill, or by sprinting, for example. \nOr you can use weights — a technique known as SuperSlow weight training. A sample workout routine is given in the featured article. In terms of health effects, HIIT may help improve a number of biomarkers associated with improved metabolic activity and good health, including: Improved insulin sensitivity and reversal of type 2 diabetes Normalized cholesterol, eliminating the need for statin drugs Reversal of bone mineral loss and reversal of osteoporosis Improved C-reactive protein levels (marker for inflammation) \n19. Address Your Heart Burn Without Hazardous, Habit Forming Drugs \nResearch clearly shows that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are severely overprescribed and misused, and do far more harm than good in the long run. 12 If you suffer from frequent heartburn, there are many alternative treatment strategies that can help you eliminate this problem without the serious side effects associated with PPIs, which include kidney disease, pneumonia, osteoporosis, hip fractures, dementia, and an increased risk for heart disease 13 and heart attacks. 14 \nThe long-term answer to heartburn and acid indigestion is to restore your natural gastric balance and function. The most important step is to eat real food, as processed foods and sugars are a surefire way to exacerbate acid reflux. Reseeding your gut with beneficial bacteria, either from traditionally fermented foods or a high quality probiotic supplement is also important. Other drug-free treatment strategies include the use of: \n✓ Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar \n✓ Baking soda", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T08:05:56.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
