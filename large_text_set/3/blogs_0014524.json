Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFulham fans are never under any illusions when it comes to who is going to stay at the club and who is going on to bigger and better things. \nWhen Roy Hodgson introduced Chris Smalling to the first team, we knew someone would come calling, and, of course, Sir Alex Ferguson did. \nIt was the same when Patrick Roberts caused people to gasp in the Hammersmith End. \nAnd when Moussa Demebele netted a then record-breaking 15 times in the Championship last season. The teenager celebrates with the fans after his brace at Newcastle (Photo: Rex Features) \nRyan Sessegnon is the latest starlet fresh from Motspur Park, and the latest player we know will one day represent a top team. \nNow that doesn't mean I'm getting the violin out just yet. \nI'm proud my club, under the leadership of Academy Director Huw Jennings - the man responsible for the Gareth Bale-led generation at Southampton - is proving capable of producing (predominantly English) talent. \nNot only does it bode well for the future of the national team, but it also has the potential to assist Fulham financially - the Demebele to Celtic deal aside.

After Felix Magath took the Whites back 15 years the team entered into a rot.

Just think about that for a moment. The teenager representing England Under-16s against the Netherlands (Photo: Getty) \nYes, footballers are getting younger and their careers are short, but Sessegnon isn't even allowed to legally drink alcohol. \nOne more season - at the very least - is not going to put prospective buyers off a bid next season. \nBut what one more season will ensure is that Sessegnon continues to progress in the same way he has been over the past eight years - away from the pressure and expectation that comes with being under a spotlight. \nFor those who don't know, the 16-year-old, who was born in nearby Wandsworth, joined the club when he was just eight years old. Slavisa Jokanovic has been careful to protect the talented 16-year-old (Photo: Rex) \nHis twin brother Steven is also at Craven Cottage, and Sessegnon has benefited greatly from this unique connection to the club. \nNot only has he grown up under the watchful eye of the coaching staff, but he has also had previous interactions with the first team players he now lines up alongside. \nA summer move to a big club would likely see him loaned straight back to a Championship outfit, who will perhaps expect a lot more from him, given his sudden rise in stature. Sessegnon in action against Aston Villa in the Championship (Photo: Neville Williams) \nThey're not likely to care about his development or confidence either - he's not their player after all - not like Jokanovic, who referred to the youngster as an \"interesting project\" and one he doesn't want to \"put under any pressure.\" \nThere is of course always the chance he is placed in the team's reserves or youth squad - in an unfamiliar setting - and is forced to battle it out with the other potential stars of the next generation for that one break in the first team. \nIt's very difficult to speculate what may happen, and a counter argument could quite easily point out that this may be his one chance for a move. (Photo: PA) \nHe might dip in form next season, fall off the radar, and it may well be advisable for him to strike while the iron is hot. \nAnd best of luck to him - I know most Fulham fan will echo my sentiment. \nBut right now I can think of worse places to be than at your boyhood club, where you are breaking into the first team under a responsible manager moving mountains to get his side back into the Premier League. I really can. poll loading Should Ryan Sessegnon stay at Fulham for now? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T20:05:29.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
