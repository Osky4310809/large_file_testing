The last player to make the team, senior guard Mike Smith , set off an instinctive pulse to keep him. \n“He hit a jump shot in practice, and I was about to cut him,” Holt said. \n“Most teams go six, seven or eight deep. But I just couldn’t let my nine through 14 go.” \nSmith scored just three points Tuesday, but in dramatic fashion, knocking down an off-balanced shot at the buzzer that encapsulated Glenville’s victory. A frantic final few seconds set it up before pumped back his left arm in midair and released in front of the MLK bench. \nIt sent Smith’s teammates into a frenzy and provided all the momentum Glenville (15-2, 11-0) needed for this Senate showdown. \nThe Tarblooders, ranked No. 20 in the cleveland.com Top 25 , will face John Hay in Wednesday in the four-team Senate tournament. MLK (13-4, 10-1) must face defending champion East Tech. \nTo senior Aaron Loines , this step showed how far his team progress. \n“A lot of people doubted us because of players we lost and things,” he said. “This really means a lot to us.” \nLoines scored 13 points and grabbed 14 rebounds. Reggie Holmes added 14 points, while guard Nelson Wheatley had 10. Glenville never trailed and slowed MLK standouts Ronald Vann (13 points) and Robert Carr (nine points) on the Crusaders’ night. \nGlenville played in the last three Senate title games but lost all three to East Tech, while the Scarabs enjoyed Markell Johnson’s three years of basketball. Before that, Holt’s program ruled the league and now has a chance to re-establish itself. \nGlenville endured the loss of last season’s leading scorer — junior forward Christian Guess, who transferred to Shaker Heights — and is riding a nine-game win streak. Its last loss came Dec. 17 at third-ranked St. Edward, and another test looms before the Senate tournament with a trip Saturday to No. 25 Lutheran East. \nHolt said he thinks his team is ready for such challenges now. He questioned them a month ago. \n“At the beginning of the year, we kind of looked goofy,” Holt said. “Now we’re tournament ready.” \nThe coach acknowledged having 14 players — and using all of them — is why his team struggled early. \nAnd why it has succeeded to this point. \n“It’s almost like we have three platoons and an army of one,” Holt said. “I’m excited about the guys and how they’ve bought into what we’re try to do.” \nHolt shuffles them in and out as squadrons. The results Tuesday included 11 players scoring baskets and five grabbing at least five rebounds. \nSmith didn’t achieve any of those marks, but almost didn’t try out this season. \nThe senior said doctors discovered he had a crooked spine in middle school while examining him for a football injury. Smith's parents let him play football again in the fall and subsequently try out for basketball. \nHe had not played for Holt the previous three years. A shot in practice made the coach change his mind about cutting Smith. \nAnother one Tuesday justified the move in Holt's mind. \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
