Well, the team over at Shutterbug was lucky enough to go on a trip to Thailand to visit the Sony Technology factory in Chunburi to find out how the Sony A7R II is put together by hand and then packaged for resale. They documented their experience in the video below, which takes you behind the scenes to show you how employees assemble, test, and box up one of the most popular mirrorless cameras on the market today. \nUnfortunately, Shutterbug wasn't able to take recording devices into every area of the factory, but they were able to catch a glimpse of how employees assemble, test, and package the A7R II by hand. That's a pretty impressive feat, considering the sheer volume they're able to church out every day. Shutterbug says : According to factory officials, around 800 finished boxes—which include two Sony A7R II camera kits per box—are produced each day at the facility in Chonburi for a total of 1,600 cameras. \nThere must be something about film equipment either receiving a human touch while it's being made or being made from scratch, because those that are are some of the most highly regarded gear used by filmmakers.
