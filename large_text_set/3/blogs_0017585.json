Take the time to occasionally remember that your needs are important and if you don’t make them a priority, no one else will. Take the time to understand those needs, and actively pursue them. \n2. Evaluate those things in life that are causing you stress and consider the value of those things. Are they important? Is the stress of your own creation and within your power to control and change? \n3. Ensure that you have a stretch of quiet alone time each day. It’s easy to get caught up in the action and noise of the day, but everyone needs a few moments to center and reset themselves; even if it’s just in the form of a long hot shower or a few moments outside. Take a moment to breathe and relax. \n4. Get rid of any guilt you might carry for occasionally treating yourself. You don’t have to justify enjoying something or indulging in something that brings you happiness. \n5. Understand that feeling that you deserve something doesn’t actually entitle you to it. If you’re unhappy with a situation in life, understand that you have to the power to change it, or at least your perspective on the matter. \n6. Take time to do those things that make you feel better about yourself. Whether it’s an indulgent beauty routine or making sure that you exercise each day, the better you feel about yourself, the better you’ll make those around you feel. \n7. Embrace your emotions if only so that you can let them go. Suppressing how you really feel about a situation only serves to undermine your happiness. Change begins with acceptance and understanding. \n8. Remember that how others treat you is more often a reflection of who they are and not a reflection of who you are. It’s important to have an understanding of how others react to us but the opinions of others, especially strangers, should only carry so much weight –as in very little. \n9. Acknowledge and appreciate those people and things which are positive and uplifting in your life. Find ways to show and remember that appreciation and commit yourself to that positivity. \n10. Each day find something new to like about yourself and something you’d like to change. Cultivate the ability to understand the difference between the things you can change and the things you cannot, and learn to let those things go. \n11. Don’t guilt yourself out of naps. Aside from the scientific evidence supporting the occasional short nap, sleep is awesome and serves to revitalize us and our efforts. Almost every situation seems better after a little rest. \n12. Eat things that make you feel good. And I don’t mean eat things that make you lose weight per se; I mean eat things that make you feel good inside and out. Things that don’t weigh you down but that motivate and strengthen you. Weight is such a constant pressure these days that it’s easy to lose sight of what’s really important: being healthy and feeling good about yourself. \n13. Remember that there are only three things in life you can control; what you think, what you say, and what you do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T08:43:45.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
