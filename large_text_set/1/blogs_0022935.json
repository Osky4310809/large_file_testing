While it featured a stacked card with NXT superstars in action, the event was interrupted at one point by WWE Raw roster member Seth Rollins and he was still unhappy about what went down on this past Monday’s episode of Raw . Did the former Shield member get what he wanted during the big event in Texas? The latest NXT Takeover results tell the story of what went down involving Rollins and more.\nThe NXT Takeover: San Antonio event was shown live streaming online Saturday night via the WWE Network and included multiple championship matches. According to ProWrestling.net , the Authors of Pain were among Saturday’s match winners , becoming the brand new tag team champions. The duo was able to withstand simultaneous submission attempts by now-former champions DIY. With a huge powerbomb and their destructive finishing move, “The Last Chapter,” the dominant tag team was able to claim the NXT belts.\nThe Authors of Pain captured the NXT tag team titles with a win over DIY Saturday night. [Image by WWE] Just after the match concluded, the NXT commentary crew talked about the upcoming NXT Women’s Championship Fatal Fourway. However, they were soon interrupted as Raw roster member Seth Rollins stormed the ring just a night after facing Braun Strowman at a WWE event in New Mexico . Rollins got on the microphone to immediately let everyone know he was taking the show over and wasn’t about to leave the ring until Triple H came out and made him. The fans obviously went wild for Rollins’ appearance, but what came next added to the ongoing drama.\nTriple H arrived out on the ramp in his business suit staring down at the ring with Rollins in it. The faceoff lasted for mere moments with “The Game” eventually motioning backstage. Instead of heading to the ring to go face-to-face with Rollins, Triple H called in security to handle his business. At first, Rollins punched away multiple security personnel and was able to get outside the ring and most of the way up the ramp. However, another group of security guards rushed Rollins and soon had him subdued. The fans chanted “Let him go” and later a “We want Rollins” chant erupted as security led the angry Raw superstar away.\nLooks like #TheMan @WWERollins will have to go through some more obstacles to get to @TripleH ! #NXTTakeOver pic.twitter.com/RUCHGhsY43 \n— WWE Universe (@WWEUniverse) January 29, 2017 \nThe latest incident continued to play up the ongoing feud between Rollins and Triple H. It all started when The Authority member cost Rollins the WWE Universal Championship months ago on Monday Night Raw . With Triple H backing Kevin Owens and seemingly cutting his ties with Rollins, the story seemed to go away for the past several weeks. However, on this past Monday’s episode of Raw , it was “Game” on as Triple H figured into Seth Rollins losing his spot in the Royal Rumble 2017 match.\nOn Monday’s Raw, an interruption by Triple H’s entrance theme caused Rollins to lose his spot in the Royal Rumble match. [Image by WWE] Now fans are left wondering if Rollins will show up again at Sunday’s pay-per-view event demanding Triple H once again, or if either superstar (or both) might come into play in the 30-man match. The latest drama on NXT Takeover: San Antonio certainly has given a little more build to what seems like an impending battle between these two stars at WrestleMania 33 .\nIn other results from Saturday’s NXT Takeover: San Antonio , Eric Young captured a win over Tye Dillinger. Tye Dillinger seemed to have control late but due to having to contend with Alexander Wolfe and Killian Dain on the outside, it allowed Young to hit a winning neck breaker. Despite losing, Dillinger remains among potential surprise superstars from the NXT roster who could enter Sunday’s Royal Rumble match.\nIn the next match, Roderick Strong was able to defeat Andrade Almas in a contest lasting nearly 12 minutes. The two traded offense throughout the bout, with Strong blocking Almas’ hammerlock DDT late and then ultimately hitting the Sick Kick to get the pinfall victory.\nIn the final two matches of the night, two more championship matches were scheduled on the card. WWE NXT Women’s Champion Asuka was set to defend the title in a Fatal Fourway which also featured Peyton Royce, Billie Kay, and Nicki Cross of Sanity. In the main event, Bobby Roode would challenge current WWE NXT Champion Shinsuke Nakamura for the title.\n[Featured Image by WWE]\nWWE News: Seth Rollins Calls Out Triple H During ‘NXT Takeover: San Antonio’ Match Results is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T04:50:17.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
