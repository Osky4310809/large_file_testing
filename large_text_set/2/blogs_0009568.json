RED, Sony, Panavision, and ARRI were recognized for their contributions to advancement in image capture, namely ARRI's pioneering design and engineering of the Alexa, which has been, by far, the most popular camera among filmmakers and DPs for the past 3 years. \nOther winners include Larry Gritz for the design of Open Shading Language (OSL), Glenn Sanders and Howard Stark for the Zaxcom Digital Wireless Microphone System, and Kiran Bhat, Michael Koperwas, Brian Cantwell and Paige Warner's ILM facial performance-capture solving system. \nHere is the full list of winners from the 2017 Academy Sci-Tech Awards, complete with descriptions straight from the Academy's press release . Scientific and Engineering Awards (Academy Plaques) \nTo ARRI for the pioneering design and engineering of the Super 35 format Alexa digital camera system. \nWith an intuitive design and appealing image reproduction, achieved through close collaboration with filmmakers, ARRI’s Alexa cameras were among the first digital cameras widely adopted by cinematographers. \nTo RED Digital Cinema for the pioneering design and evolution of the RED Epic digital cinema cameras with upgradeable full-frame image sensors. \nRED’s revolutionary design and innovative manufacturing process have helped facilitate the wide adoption of digital image capture in the motion picture industry. \nTo Sony for the development of the F65 CineAlta camera with its pioneering high-resolution imaging sensor, excellent dynamic range, and full 4K output. Sony F65 CineAlta camera \nSony’s unique photosite orientation and true RAW recording deliver exceptional image quality. \nTo Panavision and Sony for the conception and development of the groundbreaking Genesis digital motion picture camera. \nUsing a familiar form factor and accessories, the design features of the Genesis allowed it to become one of the first digital cameras to be adopted by cinematographers. \nTo Marcos Fajardo for the creative vision and original implementation of the Arnold Renderer, and to Christopher Kulla , Alan King , Thiago Ize and Clifford Stein for their highly optimized geometry engine and novel ray-tracing algorithms which unify the rendering of curves, surfaces, volumetrics and subsurface scattering as developed at Sony Pictures Imageworks and Solid Angle SL. \nArnold’s scalable and memory-efficient single-pass architecture for path tracing, its authors’ publication of the underlying techniques, and its broad industry acceptance were instrumental in leading a widespread adoption of fully ray-traced rendering for motion pictures. \nTo Vladimir Koylazov for the original concept, design and implementation of V-Ray from Chaos Group. \nV-Ray’s efficient production-ready approach to ray-tracing and global illumination, its support for a wide variety of workflows, and its broad industry acceptance were instrumental in the widespread adoption of fully ray-traced rendering for motion pictures. \nTo Luca Fascione , J.P. Lewis and Iain Matthews for the design, engineering, and development of the FACETS facial performance capture and solving system at Weta Digital. \nFACETS was one of the first reliable systems to demonstrate accurate facial tracking from an actor-mounted camera, combined with rig-based solving, in large-scale productions. This system enables animators to bring the nuance of the original live performances to a new level of fidelity for animated characters. \nTo Steven Rosenbluth , Joshua Barratt , Robert Nolty and Archie Te for the engineering and development of the Concept Overdrive motion control system. \nThis user-friendly hardware and software system creates and controls complex interactions of real and virtual motion in hard real-time, while safely adapting to the needs of on-set filmmakers. Technical Achievement Awards (Academy Certificates) \nTo Thomson Grass Valley for the design and engineering of the pioneering Viper FilmStream digital camera system. \nThe Viper camera enabled frame-based logarithmic encoding, which provided uncompressed camera output suitable for importing into existing digital intermediate workflows. \nTo Larry Gritz for the design, implementation and dissemination of Open Shading Language (OSL). \nOSL is a highly optimized runtime architecture and language for programmable shading and texturing that has become a de facto industry standard. It enables artists at all levels of technical proficiency to create physically plausible materials for efficient production rendering. \nTo Carl Ludwig , Eugene Troubetzkoy and Maurice van Swaaij for the pioneering development of the CGI Studio renderer at Blue Sky Studios. \nCGI Studio’s groundbreaking ray-tracing and adaptive sampling techniques, coupled with streamlined artist controls, demonstrated the feasibility of ray-traced rendering for feature film production.

Zaxcom Digital Wireless Microphone System \nTo David Thomas , Lawrence E. Fisher and David Bundy for the design, development and engineering of the Lectrosonics Digital Hybrid Wireless Microphone System. \nThe Lectrosonics system has advanced the state of wireless microphone technology by means of an innovative digital predictive algorithm to realize full fidelity audio transmission over a conventional analog FM radio link, by reducing transmitter size, and by increasing power efficiency. \nTo Parag Havaldar for the development of expression-based facial performance-capture technology at Sony Pictures Imageworks. \nThis pioneering system enabled large-scale use of animation rig-based facial performance-capture for motion pictures, combining solutions for tracking, stabilization, solving and animator-controllable curve editing. \nTo Nicholas Apostoloff and Geoff Wedig for the design and development of animation rig-based facial performance-capture systems at ImageMovers Digital and Digital Domain. \nThese systems evolved through independent, then combined, efforts at two different studios, resulting in an artist-controllable, editable, scalable solution for the high-fidelity transfer of facial performances to convincing digital characters. \nTo Kiran Bhat , Michael Koperwas , Brian Cantwell and Paige Warner for the design and development of the ILM facial performance-capture solving system. \nThis system enables high-fidelity facial performance transfer from actors to digital characters in large-scale productions while retaining full artistic control, and integrates stable rig-based solving and the resolution of secondary detail in a controllable pipeline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:51:34.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
