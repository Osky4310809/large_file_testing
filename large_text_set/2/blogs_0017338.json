Knocking them out was a major achievement. \nNostalgia is nice, good for a soul-soothing wallow in stressful times, yet it can also be a razor sharp reminder of what was compared to what now is. \nA Liverpool team managed by Rafa Benitez also knocked out Chelsea in the 2007 semifinals, Inter Milan in the 2008 round of 16 and Real Madrid in the 2009 round of 16. \nIt was doubly galling to see these four conquered clubs win all but one of the Champions League finals since Liverpool last made a significant impact on the tournament. The fall from grace could be described as a plummet. \nThe other final was won by Bayern Munich against Borussia Dortmund, a side led by Liverpool's current manager Jurgen Klopp. \nIt's tempting for embittered Liverpool fans to also make a note that this is the time their club was first taken over by American businessmen; February 2007. Rafael Benitez masterminded Liverpool's run to the final in 2007, where they lost to AC Milan. \nLiverpool have won one solitary trophy since things went pear-shaped for Tom Hicks and George Gillett, and qualified for the Champions League just once, in 2014 -- though it was a hugely disappointing campaign that ended in the group stage. \nSo this week was hardly a diplomatic time for current co-owner John Henry and his wife to visit the Camp Nou for Barcelona's game with Leganes. It was a grim reminder of how Liverpool used to visit the great stadiums of Europe on a regular basis, for competitive reasons. \nClubs like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich have admittedly moved onto a whole new level since Liverpool's halcyon days in the competition, yet even back then the Reds were hardly big spenders. \nMuch is made of Fenway Sports Group's reluctance to really splash the cash, yet they could reasonably suggest any club spending Â£120 million on Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing, Christian Benteke, Lazar Markovic and Mario Balotelli is unlikely to get very far. \nTrue, that might be disingenuous by ignoring their own role in signing such \"talent,\" but they could also -- if they knew anything about it -- recall the Benitez team that conquered Barcelona cost altogether less than half of the above-mentioned flops. \nAlvaro Arbeloa, a steal from Real Madrid, was the player designated to keep the burgeoning talent of Messi under wraps that night, but he was one of many bargains in Liverpool's team. Jurgen Klopp has the full support of the Liverpool fans to take the club back into the UCL. \nTimes, and fees in general, change of course, but the basic principles of that side could still work today. A good eye for talent, prudent housekeeping, great organisation, tactical awareness and passion for the cause can still take you a long way. \nThose qualities have been largely absent from Anfield in recent years but there are one or two signs they are coming back. \nKlopp is the main man, of course. His arrival was a signal that even a struggling Liverpool can still call upon the best. His two titles in Germany mirrored the triumphs of Benitez in Spain over traditional superpowers. \nWhile it was Hector Cuper who took Valencia to the Champions League final in the seasons before Benitez became their coach, Klopp also took Dortmund to the final -- losing 2-1 at Wembley to Bayern in 2013. \nDespite taking the Liverpool job in mid-season, Klopp engineered victories over Manchester United, Borussia Dortmund and Villarreal in last season's Europa League. \nThey made a mess of the final, losing 3-1 to Sevilla in Basle, but the run was still an encouraging sign the Reds aren't ready to abandon their rich European story without adding more chapters. \nQualification for the Champions League has never been tougher in England. Four points separate the five clubs immediately behind champions-elect Chelsea. \nUnlike the others, Liverpool have only the league to focus on, and a top-four spot would be considered a distinct improvement on the previous season. \nKeeping such an improvement going would be challenging. Fans would then focus on squad improvements next summer to determine if the owners really meant to take Liverpool back to better times. \nIt's worth remembering the Reds didn't take part in the Champions League until nine years after its creation in 1992, subsequently becoming one of its fiercest competitors for a time. There's no logical reason why those days can't return if the club remembers how they were achieved in the first place. \nSteven Kelly is one of ESPN FC's Liverpool bloggers.
