Indeed, since the story hit the mainstream news, many other users have been testing out the platform to see how vigorous the restrictions are.\nIt appears that YouTube hasn’t just been filtering its own content creators, however, as pop duo Tegan and Sara have also shared their upset over the streaming platform filtering their videos. Taking to social media, the band told how some of their music videos had been hidden from certain viewers.\n“We made the video for ‘U-Turn’ with the incredibly talented Seth Bogart. It is a simple and goofy video where we drive around in a plywood car and dance in front of a green screen. I have no idea why this video would be deemed too “sensitive” by YouTube,” they wrote.\nContinuing, the band went on to say that more of their videos had been restricted, and offered an explanation for why they think this might have occurred.\n“I can only assume that the content has been flagged by users who are homophobic and don’t want unassuming straight people to be turned gay by seeing us dance. What a shame,” they said. & We made the video for U-Turn with the incredibly talented Seth Bogart. It is a simple and goofy video where we drive...\nPosted by Tegan and Sara on  Monday, March 20, 2017 YouTube’s “Restricted Mode” works by a hybrid of content being “flagged” by users as being inappropriate and, it seems, key words being filtered by an algorithm.\nThe video streaming giant have (semi) apologized for what’s occurred in a tweet, stating that “LGBTQ+ videos are available in Restricted Mode, but videos that discuss more sensitive issues may not be.” \nA message to our community ... pic.twitter.com/oHNiiI7CVs \n— YouTube Creators (@YTCreators) March 20, 2017 YouTube has since shared a blog post , in which they acknowledged that the “Restricted Mode” feature “isn’t working the way it should.” \n“There’s nothing more important to us than being a platform where anyone can belong, have a voice and speak out when they believe something needs to be changed,” they wrote. “We truly appreciate your help keeping the YouTube community active and engaged on topics that matter to creators and YouTube fans alike.” \nThe post noted that certain videos, including clips by Tegan and Sara, Ash Hardell’s video of her and her partner’s wedding vows, and Calum McSwiggan’s “Coming Out To Grandma,” video had all been manually reviewed and they had “made sure they’re now available in Restricted Mode.” \nDespite offering an apology, it seems that YouTube have yet to answer questions as to why LGBTQ videos were being filtered, with some content creators questioning what constituted “sensitive issues.” \nWhat are the guidelines to determine what is \"sensitive issues\"? https://t.co/I8PLpxJ7tY \n— Hannah Hart (@harto) March 20, 2017 We’re sure that as things progress, YouTube will clarify the matter. Meanwhile, we’re going to watch all of Tegan and Sara’s music videos…\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:02:04.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
