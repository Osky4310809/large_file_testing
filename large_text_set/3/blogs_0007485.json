DX Rostov's pitch appears dry and patchy \nHe admits he is worried about injuries to his players and the conditions could influence the team he picks for tomorrow's Europa League last 16 first leg against the Russian club. \nHe said: “It's still hard for me to believe we are going to play tomorrow. I know we have to, but it is hard for me to believe we are going to play tomorrow in that field - if you can call it a field. \n“And I don't know what team to play, really. I don't know if Henrikh Mkhitaryan (just back from a hamstring injury) is going to play. \n“I don't know. I have now a lot to think because I was expecting something more playable in a vert similar pitch in the summer in China we and Manchester City decided not to play, but it looks like we have to play. GETTY Jose Mourinho has admitted his team selection is up in the air due to the pitch \n“I didn't have any contact with anyone until now [about the pitch]. I just had a quick contact with one gentleman from UEFA when I was looking at the pitch and when I told him about my concerns, the gentleman told me the players are insured, so if something happens, no problem. \n“I don't know, I really don't know. I was analysing these very good opponents that we didn't speak about yet. \n“In their previous matches against Bayern Munich, Ajax, Atletico Madrid, in all these matches it looked for me a very playable pitch and I was very surprised with what I found here today.\" Rostov pitch ahead of Manchester United clash Wed, March 8, 2017 Click to reveal the state of the Rostov pitch ahead of their Europa League clash with Man United", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T14:11:57.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
