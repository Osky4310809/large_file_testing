Instead, users will soon be able to express their level of enjoyment with a thumbs up for favorable or a thumbs down for unfavorable. \n\"Five stars feels very yesterday now,\" Todd Yellin, Netflix's VP of product innovation, told a group of journalists at the company's Los Gatos headquarters on Thursday. That system \"really projects what you think you want to tell the world. But we want to move to a system where it's really clear, when members rate, that it's for them, and to keep on making the Netflix experience better and better.\" \nThe company had beta tested the Facebook-like system with hundreds of thousands of new users around the world last year, finding that more than 200 percent more ratings were logged with the thumb system than the star system. \nNetflix also plans to start displaying a match rating that will predict how likely a viewer is to enjoy a particular title. Programs with less than a 50 percent match won't have the percentage shown, according to Variety . \nThe new rating system is expected to roll out in the coming weeks. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech stuff is cool. \nCNET Magazine : Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition.
