BROWN/Getty Images Tim Daniels Featured Columnist March 22, 2017 BIG3, the new three-on-three professional basketball league, and Fox Sports announced an agreement Wednesday to air games from the league's inaugural season on Fox Sports 1, with the championship game being shown on the Fox network. BIG3 founder Ice Cube confirmed the news during an appearance on Fox Sports 1's Undisputed . \"This is a big day for the BIG3,\" Ice Cube said. \"We are very excited â€¦ we've been waiting for this day. It's extremely exciting to be here with Fox Sports. They definitely see the picture and see the great things we are trying to do.\" The league isn't going to use a traditional format of home cities for each team. Instead, the squads will travel together to different locations for each week of the eight-game regular season, which will be followed by two weeks of postseason play to crown a champion. The BIG3's first season will take place entirely during the NBA's offseason. It's scheduled to kick off June 25 and will conclude with the title game on Aug. 26, according to the release. The announcement also included some of the league's unique rules, including a four-point shot and playing until one team reaches 60 rather than for a predetermined amount of time. The BIG3's official website lists former NBA stars Allen Iverson, Chauncey Billups, Jermaine O'Neal, Rashard Lewis, Kenyon Martin and Mike Bibby among the team captains confirmed so far. Iverson, one of the most dynamic players in NBA history, told reporters in January he decided to join the new league because it was \"success looking right into your eyes.\" When asked who he wanted on his team, he chose a couple of former Los Angeles Lakers. \"Shaq and Kobe, that's a no-brainer,\" Iverson said. Although O'Neal and Bryant aren't on the initial player list, it wouldn't be a surprise to see more high-profile names join AI if the first BIG3 campaign is a success. It's a short season that could help quench the competitive fire many athletes still have after leaving the game. In the short term, Fox Sports announced the complete schedule and the team chosen to broadcast games will be made public in the near future.
