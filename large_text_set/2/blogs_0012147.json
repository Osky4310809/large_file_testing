John McCain, R-Ariz., continued his recent pattern of being a thorn in the side of Donald Trump by announcing Wednesday he will vote against the president’s pick to head the Office of Management and Budget. \nTrump has chosen Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., to fill the post. The congressman currently serves on the House Committee on Financial Services and is a budget hawk. \nMcCain, who serves as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he opposes Mulvaney’s appointment because of his past opposition to increases in defense spending.

Our military leaders have testified that these cuts have placed the lives of our military service members at greater risk. But Congressman Mulvaney has said that, in the greater scheme of things, sequestration cuts were not that big,” McCain stated. \nThe U.S. defense budget in 2013 was approximately $530 billion, making up one-fifth of all federal spending. By comparison, the defense budget in 2001 — which was pre-9/11 — was $287 billion. \nThe budget for the current fiscal year is $583 billion.
