Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA footballer bullied a 14-year-old girl into meeting him for a sexual liaison in his car outside his club's stadium, a court has heard. \nOldham Athletic star Jack Tuohy, 20, allegedly pressured the youngster into sexual activity by telling her \"don't speak to me again, you're all talk\" when she expressed concern about doing \"stuff\" in his car. \nA jury Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard Tuohy went on to talk about the girl performing oral sex on him during the text message conversation. \nHe is alleged to have written: \"I'll wear something easy to get into like joggers... Just get in and just start feeling my d*** it will be fine... then go down while I drive.\" \nThe midfielder denies sexual activity with a child, three counts of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and meeting a girl under 16 years of age following grooming. \nThe court heard Tuohy first met the girl handing out medals at her school sports day.

Stop messing me around you coming or not. Can't I just drive to near your house? Surely you know one place where no one goes? \nGirl: ''No I'm not allowed I will get grounded. I don't really meet lads in cars I'm not sure. I've met you before.'' \nTuohy: ''Are you coming or not?'' \nGirl: ''This is my only chance isn't it? I don't want to do stuff if we just met.'' \nTuohy: ''Wow so you're all talk wow. Don't speak to me again you're all talk.'' \nGirl: ''What would you want to do. I would do some stuff. S*ck you off. Probs. If you want.'' \nTuohy: ''Best not tell one person. I'll wear something easy to get into like joggers haha. You better not back out. Just be confident. But tell no one. Just get in and just start feeling my d*** it will be fine. It will make you feel comfortable just start rubbing it on top of my pants and then go down while I drive.''

That was a lie. He said she had told him she was 16. Jack Tuohy is alleged to have groomed the girl before she performed oral sex on him (Photo: Cavendish Press) \n\"The first time they met she was in school uniform and on that occasion the victim took a photo of them together on her mobile phone. \n\"In his second interview he admitted the to kissing and cuddling the victim and that in his previous interview he panicked because the police had told him the victim's actual age. \n\"He denied that serious acts had taken place. He said explicit messages had been sent but he said that the messages were just flirting and nothing serious would come of it. \n\"He said that she was sending graphic messages and images and that she was the one who was taking the lead. \n\"Those messages demonstrate that he was well aware of just how young and immature the victim was.\" \nTuohy, from Lower Dingle, Oldham, Greater Manchester, denies charges of sexual activity with a child, three counts of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and meeting a girl under 16 years of age following grooming. \nThe trial continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:44:24.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
