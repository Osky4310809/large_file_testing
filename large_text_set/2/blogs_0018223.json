From the Hill :\nA survey from Harvard–Harris Poll provided exclusively to The Hill found that 80 percent of voters say local authorities should have to comply with the law by reporting to federal agents the illegal immigrants they come into contact with…\nA majority — 52 percent — say they support Trump’s two executive orders allowing for the construction of a southern border wall, increasing the number of immigration officers by 10,000 and finding a way to revoke federal funds for sanctuary cities.\nThe crackdown on sanctuary cities is the most popular feature of those actions, followed closely by the directive to increase the border patrol, which is backed by 75 percent of voters.\nA Reuters story published last month estimated the nation’s top 10 sanctuary cities could lose $2.3 billion in federal funds if they refuse to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Democratic mayors in Chicago and New York have vowed not to cooperate with any efforts to end sanctuary city policies. However, other parts of the country have voted to end the policies. Miami-Dade county dropped its sanctuary status last week.\nOverall, this is a very positive poll for Trump. The one exception is the construction of a southern border wall. When this one piece of his agenda is separated from the rest, poll respondents opposed the wall 53-47.\nEverything else Trump has proposed, including his temporary travel ban on immigration from 7 nations, has majority support. Support for the travel ban went as high as 60% when the question described the 7 countries that are the targets of the ban as “Muslim majority countries.”\nA majority of respondents (51%) thought the number of immigrants the U.S. takes in from Syria, which President Obama set at 100,000 this fiscal year, should be lower. Only 15% thought it should be higher.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:46:11.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
