The senior will miss the remainder of the season after suffering a torn ACL in Friday's semifinal win over California. Erik Skopil of 247Sports and Justin Hopkins of ScoopDuck.com reported the news. Boucher averaged 11.8 points and 6.1 rebounds per game for the Ducks as a stretch forward. He was knocking down 52.4 percent of his shots overall and 35.0 percent from deep. Perhaps the most amazing part of the story is that Boucher continued to play after suffering the injury in the first half. He went down hard under the basket in the first half and showed signs of pain, but he played 24 effective minutesâ€”a number that's right in line with his regular-season average (23.6). He scored 10 points and added four rebounds, as the Ducks earned a 73-65 victory. Oregon head coach Dana Altman made no mention of the injury in his postgame press conference, and it's unclear when the Ducks knew something was amiss. They are slated to play in their third consecutive Pac-12 championship game Saturday night against Arizona. Currently ranked as the No. 5 team in the country, Oregon may see its seeding changed due to Boucher's injury. ESPN's Joe Lunardi currently has the Ducks as a No. 2 seed, but a conference championship could have put them on the No. 1 seed line. Now the committee will have to assess how much Boucher's loss damages their case. Kavell Bigby-Williams will likely see the most expansion in his role.
