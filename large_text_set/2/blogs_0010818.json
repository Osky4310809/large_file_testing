This woman can carry anything and everything just so flawlessly. Be it pregnancy or post pregnancy – Bebo has been an inspiration to a lot of women out there and I bet you wouldn’t deny that. The actress was LIVE on Facebook with her dietician Rujuta Diwekar and listed down the do’s and don’t’s for very woman during and after pregnancy. It has only been a month and a half since Kareena delivered Taimur Ali Khan and just look at her.. she is already getting back in shape. For all those who have been wondering how, the actress and her dietician finally revealed the secret to Bebo’s instant weight loss. Not just that Kareena even talked about how she and Saif have been taking turns to look after Taimur and how life has been after pregnancy. So here’s taking a look at 5 revelations Bebo made about herself, baby Taimur and her secret to having a gloriously good-looking body.

Talking about how beautiful Taimur is, Kareena said, “He is the most gorgeous child not because he is mine.. he has that because I ate ghee and all those things.. all the pizzas and ghee and parathas have gone into him.” \nOn putting on 18 kilos during pregnancy \n“I put on 18 kilos and I was happily flaunting my weight everywhere.. until I entered the hospital in fact!”So cool! Every pregnant woman should take cues from Kareena. “The way I enjoyed my pregnancy I didn’t know what would happen post pregnancy. I didn’t know what this phase would be like but now I do know that I feel more energetic, happy and content,” she added further. \nWondering what is that one thing Kareena can’t live without? \nNope, it’s NOT Saif.. It’s her daily intake of chaai and coffee. During the chat she revealed how she just cannot do without her coffee and chai and she has to have it every day. \nNo crash diets for Bebo.. \nAfter giving birth to Taimur, Kareena was in a rush to lose all the pregnancy weight and she, in fact, suggested her dietician that she should get back to her Tashan diet. Yep! The crash diet which got her into size zero but Rujuta Diwekar clearly said no to it. Because she wanted the weight loss to be a gradual process. (ALSO READ: Kareena Kapoor Khan wants to go back to her Tashan diet ) \nGoing all out after pregnancy \nKareena has resumed her normal life after pregnancy and apparently that has raised many eyebrows. On going all out after pregnancy, Kareena made an absolutely valid point where she went on to say, “Love is not showing that you’re staying at home..no one can question a parent’s love for their child. For example, if a girl gets married and lives with her husband after marriage, that doesn’t mean she doesn’t love her parents enough, you know what I mean..?” \nCheck out her pics from the outing today.. \nShe looks absolutely beautiful! \nOn the work front, she is next gonna be seen in Veere Di Wedding which also stars Sonam Kapoor, Shikha Talsania and Swara Bhaskar in lead roles.  34 pm | Updated: February 14, 2017 7:37 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:31:34.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
