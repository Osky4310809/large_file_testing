FingerTouch is a new jailbreak tweak that uses the same concept, but for Touch ID. \nThis tweak allows you to use various Touch ID gesture to perform specific actions. It currently offers five different gestures including: Single tap Hold Tap and hold \nYou can assign a custom action to any of these gestures. Here are all the actions that are available: Lock your device Turn on or turn off the flashlight Take a screenshot Switch to the last open app Invoke Siri Enable or disable rotation lock Open Control Center or Notification Center Close the current app \nAs you can see, the tweak offers a number of useful actions that can be assigned to the Touch ID gestures. \nYou can configure the tweak from its dedicated preferences pane in Settings. From there, you can assign these actions to any Touch ID gesture. Apart from this, it offers a number of useful options such as: Enable or disable the tweak Enable or disable vibrational feedback when you press Touch ID Adjust the intensity of the vibration Set the time limit during which the gesture should be performed \nFingerTouch is a very useful tweak for performing certain actions quickly using Touch ID. One thing that I noticed is that the Hold gesture is invoked by mistake when you want to press the Home button. It’s better that you keep it disabled to avoid mistakes. Other than this, the remaining four gestures work nicely. \nFingerTouch is quite similar to a tweak called Touchr. They both offer similar features, but FingerTouch is available for free whereas Touchr is a paid tweak. \nIf you’re in to give this tweak a try, FingerTouch can be downloaded for free via Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
