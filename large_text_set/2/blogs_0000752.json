It’s developed School of Fish, a curriculum that’s aimed to promote and teach computational thinking to preschool children.\nComputational thinking is a problem solving method inspired by how software coders solve programming problems. It involves breaking down problems into smaller parts, recognizing patterns, and developing step-by-step solutions. It promotes a structured, analytical way of thinking that’s essential in approaching coding, while still encouraging creative thinking.\nPreschoolers can learn and improve their digital literacy, even at a young age. While there are several websites that provide tools for parents to get their kids familiar with coding, Jules has created a structured approach that preschools can integrate into their teaching programs.\nThe firm is working with a number of preschools in Singapore to integrate School of Fish into their curriculum, like Carpe Diem, Sherwood Childcare, and most recently with Cherie Hearts – a subsidiary of educational childcare company G8 Education. 345 pupils from 23 Cherie Hearts centers got started on the curriculum in January.\nThe lessons, delivered to preschoolers via tablets, feature interactive teacher characters (or “learning buddies”), games, activities, and videos. There is also a dashboard for parents to keep track of their child’s progress and performance.\n“Through School of Fish, we believe more preschoolers can learn and improve their digital literacy, even at a young age. The learning process must be fun and interactive for children,” says Jules founder Jonathan Chan.\nJules’ computational thinking curriculum for preschool children.

However, preschools do take care to limit the time their pupils spend on the curriculum.\nSingapore has put more effort in building up children’s digital and technical skills. 19 secondary schools in the city-state have started teaching programming at the O level this year, phasing out previous computer studies subjects. The new classes teach Python, previously only taught at A level.\nThis post Now even preschools teach computational thinking in Singapore appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:07:37.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
