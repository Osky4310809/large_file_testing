A post shared by James Krause (@thejameskrause) on Mar 13, 2017 at 5:15am PDT \n“Going home today!” Krause wrote in his latest post. “10 days in the hospital, 3 (2.5ish) surgeries, but the infection is gone and I’m feeling better. Will be on crutches and will still have a PICC line for a couple weeks but all is improving!” \nAccording to Krause, the surgery to take care of the infection left an eight-inch gash on his leg before doctors went back in to finish cleaning and close up the incision. A post shared by James Krause (@thejameskrause) on Mar 11, 2017 at 8:47am PST \nKrause says the infection happened after he suffered a cut on his leg while filming “The Ultimate Fighter” this past season and just days after the show wrapped he ended up in the hospital for treatment. A post shared by James Krause (@thejameskrause) on Mar 5, 2017 at 10:53am PST \nKrause joined the show as an active member of the UFC roster while facing off against 13 other former cast members from the series with coaches Cody Garbrandt and T.J. Dillashaw leading the way. \nThe good news is Krause appears to be on the road to recovery after spending more than week in the hospital dealing with the staph infection. \nKrause will make his first appearance on the new season of “The Ultimate Fighter” when the show debuts on Wednesday night, April 19 at 10 p.m. on FS1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:10:33.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
