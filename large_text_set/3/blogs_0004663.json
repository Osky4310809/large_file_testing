She was 87. \n“She was a loving mother, a loving grandmother, a loving aunt and a loving sister, and she loved Queens, and always did everything she could to take care of everybody,” said her daughter, Agnes Marie Marshall, of Elmhurst.

Put your eye on the star and keep it there and keep on rising,” is the quote Marshall selected for her biography on the History Makers website. \nWhen superstorm Sandy swept through Breezy Point in October 2012, Marshall was on the scene while the ruins still smoldered, making sure everyone was evacuated. \n  \nOne of her “best moments” was creating the Queens General Assembly, a cross-cultural exchange center, she told the Queens Tribune in 2013, her last year in office. \nEducation was one of her lifelong passions; her many contributions include securing hundreds of millions of dollars for schools and libraries. \nMelinda Katz, the current borough president, saluted Marshall as a trailblazer and “larger than life” figure.

In 1982, she won the first of five terms to the State Assembly, and in 1991, voters in New York City’s 21st District elected her to the City Council. \n“Helen Marshall was as bighearted, dynamic and brave as the borough of Queens, which she represented with such determined grace for three decades in many roles,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. \nRep. Joe Crowley (D-Queens, the Bronx) said the borough had lost one of its biggest champions. “She always fought hard to ensure we got our fair share and she is leaving behind an incredible legacy of helping those in need.” \nShe enjoyed spending summers, her favorite season, in Sag Harbor, according to the History Makers website. \nMarshall’s husband, Donald, died a month ago, her daughter said. \nOther survivors include her son, Donald Jr., of Los Angeles, and his two children, Chandler, and Chosen.
