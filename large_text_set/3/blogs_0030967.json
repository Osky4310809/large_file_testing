File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - Philippine Airlines (PAL) is set to take in a strategic investor from the airline industry as early as the first-half of this year, its top official said. \nPAL president and chief operating officer Jaime Bautista told reporters on the sidelines of the flag carrier’s 76th Anniversary Expo with Globe Telecom Inc. the airline is hopeful a deal could be made with the foreign airline within the first semester. \n“We’re almost there,” he said, adding the discussions are now in the advanced stage. \nAmong the items still under discussion with the foreign airline are the valuation, as well as whether the strategic investor would enter PAL or listed PAL Holdings Inc. which operates the national carrier. \nBautista said PAL is prepared to sell up to the 40 percent allowed by law to the foreign airline if the latter would be willing to acquire it. \nPAL could benefit from the entry of a strategic investor in terms of the partner’s contribution in equity, management, route development or possible membership in an alliance.   \nBautista said the strategic investor would also make it easier for PAL to achieve its target of becoming a five-star airline by 2020. \nPAL which has yet to release financial results for 2016, expects to have posted profitable operations last year. \nThe carrier, however, sees 2017 as a tough year due to some risks. \n“2017 will be a challenging year,” Bautista said noting the rising price of fuel, increasing competition, weakening of the peso, as well as congestion at the country’s main international gateway in Manila. \n“Our ability to grow in Manila is stymied by the congestion. That’s why we’re expanding our operations in other airports, Clark, Cebu, Davao,” he said. \nTo support expansion of operations, PAL is looking to spend around $700 million this year for new aircraft. \nPAL which currently has a fleet of 81 aircraft expects to take delivery of five Q400s, two Boeing 777-300ERs and two Airbus 321neos to end this year with a total of 90 aircraft. \nDuring PAL’s 76th Anniversary Expo, the carrier under a partnership with Globe, offered an exclusive seat sale to allow the telco’s subscribers to get up to 15 percent exclusive discount on select flights.
