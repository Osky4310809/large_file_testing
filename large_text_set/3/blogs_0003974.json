Her temperament only adds to the resort’s magnificent moxie.\nAnd we lived to tell the tale. See how.\nWHY NOW? Toast Cliff House’s year-round “reimagining.” Cliff House Because US Sen. Susan Collins told you to!\nThe state’s maverick Republican stopped by the 132-room hotel (more rooms to come), closed since October 2015 for massive renovations and opened last summer, to audaciously anoint it a “reimagined” year-round destination. (Cliff House used to close for the season.)\nOther reasons aiding and abetting the cause include the hotel’s great big pile of indoor/outdoor newness including a luxury spa and wellness center, oceanfront dining and bars, redesigned rooms and a dramatic cliffside ballroom.\n“Indigenous” landscaping, to boot!\nThe fact that devastating climate change decided to gift us with a psychotically warm and balmy winter this go-round, doesn’t hurt either (yet).\nWORKING WELL The sea was angry that weekend, my friends.\nThrashing and roaring and frothing at the mouth, she wanted me dead, and she was mere feet away.\nBut I just sat in the property’s new spa’s sun lounge sanctuary in my white robe, holding a cup of herbal tea, just mocking and laughing at her hissy-fitting through giant, reinforced windows.\nWatching these violent Atlantic waves, this aquatic pugilism in motion, is better than MMA, any day — it’s like a personal showing of “A Perfect Storm” on a giant UHDTV but, you know, better.\nMUST-TRY There’s a hot tub here somewhere, see if you can spot it. Cliff House It’s the most beautiful compound noun in the English language: hot tub. And Cliff House has a seductive, new indoor one waiting for your dunking (there’s a pool, too, if you must). But the real treat is the large outdoor tub where it provides a steamy zone of invincibility when those mean, scary storms roll in overhead.\nFeel free to tell those rumbling clouds, “Cash me outside!”\nGET ACTIVE It’s counterintuitive, but those who live in Maine know your winter only improves if you go outdoors and get the adrenaline pumping. Try sledding on Cliff House’s knoll, moonlight snowshoeing, snowmobiling in nearby Sanford (the hotel’s rec team is especially of help here) or the hotel’s glow-in-the-dark mini golf, for starters.\nYou can also take a beer trek along Maine’s coast with David D’Auteuil’s Best Brew Tours (he drives, you don’t) or catch a performance of “Million Dollar Quartet” at the Ogunquit Playhouse.\nAnd if you get there fast, you can take advantage of the state’s Restaurant Week , running through Sunday.\nTons of peeps at the beach, fresh local spirits, beer and food…a local guide who lives and works here @gatewaytomaine @ogunquitmaine @ogunquitwelcomesyou @york_maine @yorkvillagemaine @unionbluff our group today enjoyed @wigglybridgedistillery @somebrewingco @bearairishbrew \nA post shared by Best Brew Tours (@bestbrewtours) on Jul 3, 2016 at 2:30pm PDT \nGiven the time of year (although if this winter is a guide, who even knows anymore?), there’s a chance a nor’easter will rain on your parade, so luckily there’s plenty of indoor hijinks to be had at Cliff House, as well (its Web site even has an entire page devoted to storm days). Enjoy vintage arcade and pinball games at its Nubb’s Lobster Shack restaurant, pool tables, a “beer bash” tasting on March 17, bingo, gingerbread house making/eating … and that hot tub and spa, duh!\nNEEDS WORK When a storm rolls in, take cover under the sheets of your oceanfront king. Cliff House Remember, this is still Maine. It gets really cold and it gets really rainy — and there are sections of the hotel where you have to briefly walk outside in order to move between them (room to lobby, e.g.) where you’ll experience the forecast, first-hand.\nThe staff has a secret network of hallways that provide 100 percent indoor cover throughout, but unless your bribe game is on point, you won’t be using it.\nBOTTOM LINE Is Maine the new Florida for winter vacations? No, stop being weird. However, this place is making a helluva go at it.\nDETAILS The “Wicked Winter Escape” promo starts at $199 per night until April 30; DestinationHotels.com \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T09:50:05.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
