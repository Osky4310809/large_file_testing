That will come back. It is natural and very difficult\", said Wenger. \n“Jenkinson has not played for a long long period. You think you are there and you will only realise in six months that he is not completely there. And then you will play and realise you are not as good as you think you should be and you lose confidence. He is going through that period at the moment. \n“Does he suffer in comparison to Hector Bellerin? Yes, because Bellerin is one of the best in his position certainly in Europe but Carl can compete with him. At the moment, no, because mentally he has not found back his total level and not his confidence.” \nThe boyhood Arsenal fan arrived at the club from Charlton Athletic in 2011 but has found himself down in the pecking order at right-back with Hector Bellerin and Mathieu Debuchy both ahead of him.
