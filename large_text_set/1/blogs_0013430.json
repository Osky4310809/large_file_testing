The Falcons defense pressured Russell Wilson and forced two fourth quarter interceptions, helping Atlanta secure a 36-20 victory. \nAtlanta’s defense did have some big lapses. As a matter of fact, the Seahawks opened the game with a drive that took 8:34 off the clock and culminated in a 7-yard touchdown pass from Russell Wilson to Jimmy Graham. Seattle made it look easy, but the Falcons defense bounced back. \nMomentum started to shift in the second quarter, when Wilson had the misfortune of getting stepped on by his center, forcing him to fall backward into Seattle’s own end zone for a safety. \nThe Falcons added seven just before the end of the half on a 14-yard Matt Ryan pass to Tevin Coleman, and Atlanta took a 19-10 lead into halftime. \nThe Seahawks clearly miss Earl Thomas on the field. Thomas is a versatile defender, and his absence was felt, particularly against the Falcons’ run game. In the second half, Devonta Freeman took advantage of Thomas’ replacement , Steven Terrell, on a catch for a 53-yard gain. \nConsidering how dynamic Atlanta’s offense has been this season, all the defense really has to do is enough. The top-scoring offense in the league during the regular season looks like it can outscore any team. \nRyan spread the ball around, hitting eight different receivers for 338 yards and three touchdowns. And while the Falcons offense is always a story, the young defense stepped up to ensure the win for Atlanta. \nWhether it was a crushing hit from rookie undrafted free agent cornerback Brian Poole to keep Russell Wilson from running for a first down, or a fourth quarter interception by free safety Ricardo Allen, the Falcons defense absolutely did enough. \nSeattle did their best to pull off a late-game rally, but an interception by rookie linebacker Deion Jones just before the final two-minute warning removed all hope for the Seahawks. \nAtlanta’s defense gave up big plays here and there, as they have been prone to do all season. In the fourth quarter, they allowed a 31-yard Doug Baldwin touchdown that cut the Falcons’ lead to 36-20. \nThe two things this defense has improved over the course of the season, though, are pressuring the quarterback and creating takeaways. The Falcons sacked Wilson three times, and the interceptions were catastrophic for Seattle. \nThe Falcons advance to the NFC Championship and will face either the Green Bay Packers or the Dallas Cowboys, depending on the outcome of Sunday’s divisional matchup.
