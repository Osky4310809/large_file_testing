Los Blancos came close to signing De Gea on transfer deadline day in the 2015 summer transfer window, and Jose Felix Diaz of Spanish daily Marca reported their revived interest could force the Red Devils to act. United have kept a firm hold of their stopper since a paperwork error saw his proposed move to the Santiago Bernabeu fall apart at the last minute 18 months ago, per BBC Sport , while Real have remained avid admirers. It's mentioned by Diaz that Los Blancos believe De Gea has a â‚¬65 million (Â£55.5 million) release clause in his contract, although Yahoo Sport's Andrew Gaffney has suggested the transfer is unlikely: Andrew Gaffney @GaffneyVLC @Don_Tortilla Iâ€™d say Courtois is definitely the favourite. De Gea unlikely to move yet but depends on Unitedâ€™s progress (or lack of). 2/6/2017, 4:48:06 PM It seems De Gea would need to start actively pushing for a move to the Spanish capital in order for such a transfer to materialise, and many may question whether the goalkeeperâ€”who is adored at Old Traffordâ€”would do so. What's more, it helps that United now have a new world-class force ahead of De Gea, and he recently took to Twitter to celebrate Eric Bailly's return to the squad after the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations: David De Gea @D_DeGea .@ericbailly24 has returned better: he speaks better English, better Spanish... I'm glad to have you back! ðŸ˜€ #mufc https://t.co/F18UmOsrjf 2/7/2017, 4:30:50 PM After enjoying a superb 2015-16 campaign at the Bernabeu, Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas hasn't been quite as solid in his role between the posts this term, resulting in uncertainty over his future at Real. De Gea, on the other hand, has played a hand in building one of the Premier League's best defences this season, with the Red Devils conceding just 21 goals in 24 outings so far â€” the third-best record of any outfit. Los Blancos are said to believe De Gea, 26, \" can become their custodian for a full 10 years,\" and with United struggling to pull themselves closer to the Premier League summit, this could be an ideal time for Real to strike. However, the Spaniard is a near-invaluable piece of the puzzle at Old Trafford, and Samuel Luckhurst of the Manchester Evening News illustrated his worth to the team: Samuel Luckhurst @samuelluckhurst De Gea has only missed six games in five-and-a-half years at #mufc through injury. Three of them were last season. 2/3/2017, 12:48:06 PM United are likely to prove tough negotiators in the event they receive a bid for their goalkeeping marvel, who was responsible for winning his own share of points during last season's run to fifth place. A move back to Spain's capital would see De Gea swiftly restore his former title prospects, but United plan to extend his stay in their latest attempt to fend off Real Madrid's watchful gaze.
