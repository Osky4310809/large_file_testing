Even some Republicans have expressed concern. \nMost experts still agree that Tillerson, despite Democrats' objections, is a strong bet for confirmation. Texas Sen. John Cornyn has called Tillerson an \"inspired choice.\" He said Tillerson needs to answer questions about Russia, but added Tillerson's past is an \"advantage.\" \n\"He's got a context, and a record of interaction with him that I think will make him more effective negotiating on behalf of the United States,\" he said. Seal of approval: John Cornyn will introduce Rex Tillerson at Senate hearing \nThe Iran transactions, however, will open up a new line of questions for Tillerson's critics. And some like Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune were quick to pounce, saying that Tillerson \"can not be trusted to act in the best interest of our country.\" \nThe USA TODAY report noted that the SEC questioned why Exxon didn't disclose to shareholders the deals from the early 2000s. The SEC said such disclosures should be based, in part, on \"the potential impact of corporate activites upon a company's reputation and share value.\" \nAn Exxon official told the SEC at the time said the deals were \"not material,\" given the companies billions in revenue, USA TODAY reported. The official said then that the deals were done under a \"policy and procedure consistent with U.S. legal requirements.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:13:14.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
