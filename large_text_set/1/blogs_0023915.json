Love has been dealing with back issues since he came to Cleveland and he missed a game earlier this month with spasms. \nJames became the first player in Cavaliers history to score 20,000 points for the franchise. He came in needing six points to hit the plateau and reached it with a layup early in the second quarter. \nOklahoma City played its first game without reserve center Enes Kanter. He broke his right forearm punching a chair Thursday in a win over Dallas, had surgery Friday and will be out at least a month. \nLeading by 13 at halftime, the Cavs let the Thunder get back within eight before Irving put on a show with several drives to the basket. \nShowing off his magnificent dribbling skills to open space and tie up defenders, Irving scored three layups in a span of 58 seconds to put Cleveland back up by 17. \nOklahoma City made a run with Westbrook on the bench in the fourth, getting within 82-75 but Irving scored a pair of layups and later drained a 30-foot 3-pointer to give the Cavs a 98-82 lead. \nWearing a Michael Jackson-inspired red leather “Thriller” jacket, Westbrook walked into the arena about two hours before tip-off with Jackson’s “Don’t Stop `Til You Get Enough” playing from the speakers near the security entrance. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T01:23:27.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
