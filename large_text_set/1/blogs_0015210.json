Thrustmaster’s $200 T.1600M FCS Flight Pack combines joystick, throttle and rudder pedals in one lovely entry-level package.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nBetween the rise of virtual reality and an expanding audience of people with incredibly good taste in game genres, space sims and flight sims are experiencing a renaissance. Games like Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen are getting people flying, and from there it’s a short hop to more realistic stuff like Digital Combat Simulator World . \nBut first the new players need to trade their game pads for something a bit more appropriate. They need joysticks with triggers and hat switches. They need a throttle. They don’t necessarily need rudder pedals, but if you’re going in you might as well go all-in. That’s what the Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS Flight Pack is all about. \nWhat It Is The T.16000M FCS Flight pack is a complete HOTAS setup for PC, comprised of three parts. \n\nAt the heart of the package is a slight retooling of Thrustmaster’s popular T.16000M flight stick, one of the more popular starter sticks on the market. The T.16000M utilizes Thrustmaster’s Hall Effect Accurate Technology (H.E.A.R.T.), utilizing magnetic sensors in the stick to heighten accuracy, smooth movement and reduce wear. Along with an orange redeco (the original has a green thing going on), the new T.1600M features raised bumps on the 12 buttons located on the unit’s base, making it easier to know what you’re pushing when you’re sporting a virtual reality headset. \nAdvertisement \n\nAlong with those base buttons, the T.1600M features its own throttle switch, three buttons and a four-way POV hat up top, as well as the obligatory trigger. The stick not only moves in all the ways one expects a stick to move, it can also be twisted left and right, rolling or turning your craft of choice depending on your configuration. \nThe T.16000M is an ambidextrous flight stick, packed with plastic pieces to move the hand rest from the right side to the left. \n\nThe second part of the set is the Thrustmaster Weapon Control System (TWCS) Throttle, which gets its own special acronym tech—Sliding Motion Advanced Rail Tracks (S.M.A.R.T.). Rather than pivot on an axis like most throttle controls, the TWCS slides smoothly back and forth on a pair of rails. \n\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:13:05.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
