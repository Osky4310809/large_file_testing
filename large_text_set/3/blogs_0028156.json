I’m refusing to let them be sad.” \n“I love her beyond measure,” said Carol, who is now caring for her mum in Bristol, along with her brother and sister.

She refuses to let us be sad so we are taking our lead from her.” \nCarol posted on Twitter: “A precious Mother’s Day. \n“This week Mum & I found out she has terminal cancer. She’s 88, beautiful inside and out & I love her beyond measure.” \nPosting an image of the family together, she added: “Mum’s lunch with all her children, all her grandchildren and her gorgeous great grandchild Alex. Lots of laughing.” \nOver the past 14 years, Jean has beaten cancer three times. \nIn her 2010 autobiography, Carol said the family were “rocked” and “in a state of turmoil” when they first discovered Jean had ovarian cancer in 2003, after falling ill over Christmas.
