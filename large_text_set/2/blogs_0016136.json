The group of volunteers decided to spread their advocacy to other communities because of the impact they saw on the kids. \n\" Some of the kids are now varsity players in their respective schools. We were able to make them realize that sports is not just sports. They can use it to change their lives, make themselves better individuals, and to help other people,\" Binalla said. \nThe same year that YSA was founded, it was named one of the Ten Accomplished Youth Organizations in the country . This paved the way for YSA to realize its true potential to be an instrument of social change through sports. \n\"Volunteerism has been the backbone of YSA's success and we were inspired to promote volunteerism more,\" the organization said . MORE THAN MEDALS. YSA holds a mini-Olympics to raise the kids' competitiveness in sports. Photo courtesy of YSA Binalla added: \"We want people to realize that they don't need to be financially stable or to be successful athletes to be able to give back. We always emphasize on our social media posts that they can give back if they have time, passion for sports, and the willingness to share these to the youth.\" For YSA, change is all about instilling the discipline of sports in the next generation. – Rappler.com \nYouth Sports Advocacy is a partner organization of Rappler's civic engagement arm MovePH.
