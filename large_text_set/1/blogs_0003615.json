(That’s obviously a rhetorical question.) The thoughtful folks at Sleep Number know the struggle is real, and they’ve created a new, high-tech mattress that warms your feel while you fall asleep .\nThis amazing mattress, which we need STAT , does all the work for you — it starts to heat up around your usual bedtime, tracks your sleep habits with an app , and shuts off once you’re asleep. And, if you have trouble falling asleep, it may help with that, too — Sleep Number claims the mattress will help you fall asleep faster.\nBeing cozy is great and all, but insomniacs may question whether or not it’ll actually help us fall asleep faster — so what’s the real deal?\nThis mattress really is the stuff of dreams (pun intended), because studies have shown that heating your feet does help you fall asleep by causing your blood vessels to dilate, signaling to your brain that it’s time for some shut-eye. Plus, we all know how hard it is to fall asleep when we’re uncomfortable — and cold feet are the worst. \nPexels The Sleep Number 360 will be for sale online and in stores early this year — so, we may not need to rely on our collections of cozy socks for much longer.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:38:36.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
