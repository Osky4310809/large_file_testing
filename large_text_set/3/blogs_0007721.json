He had a breakout season in 2014 with 53 receptions, then was a big part again of the Steelers’ offense in 2015 with 44 catches and a career-best five touchdowns. \nHe was limited to three games by injury last season, and it’s no surprise that he’s moving on from the Steelers for a fresh start. The Bears will likely make multiple additions at the wide receiver position, and they’re hoping the speedy Wheaton can recapture his prior form. \nWheaton has eight career touchdown receptions.
