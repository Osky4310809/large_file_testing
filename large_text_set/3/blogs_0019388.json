Pomona native Rene Contreras' promotion company, Viva Presents , was one of the first to start booking Latin bands from Chile, Argentina and Costa Rica on the same bills as such American bands as Crystal Antlers and The Growlers. His annual Viva Pomona! festival has become a daylong expression of this mash-it-up-and-see-what-happens approach. \n\"When I started booking shows, having a garage band play with a Spanish band was unheard of,\" Contreras says. \"I kind of had to force these bands from different communities or cultures of people to come together, and of course they discovered that they understand each other. \n\"The Latin music industry had its moments, but they didn't evolve. They stayed in one spot and stayed content. We're taking it elsewhere.\" \nJorge Avila started his booking and artist management firm, Qvolé Collective , in 2011 to help young Latino artists he wasn't hearing on the radio. His first two acts were a then-unknown Chicano Batman and Long Beach's Wild Pack of Canaries, a psych-rock band fronted by now–solo artist Rudy De Anda. Current Qvolé clients include Rialto-based jazz/psych-rock trio Brainstory, San Fernando Valley rockabilly act Cutty Flam and Buyepongo, all of whom Avila says can reach wider audiences by catering to the different influences they draw from. \n\"A lot of it is carving out different spaces for these Latin artists. Buyepongo's roots are in hip-hop, so they can do an interview in Wax Poetics , and it makes sense,\" he says. \nThe arrival of venues such as the Hi Hat and Resident, as alternatives to the crowded Echo and Troubadour scenes, also has been crucial, Avila says. \"Even just a year ago, we didn't really have an L.A. venue where you can have shows and grow and cultivate an audience outside of La Cita. It's been really instrumental for raising visibility of artists we're working with and bringing in other groups from other places.\" \nThat visibility got even higher earlier this month when Coachella added six more Latin bands to its lineup, including local first-timers Quitapenas and Thee Commons. Together with such previously announced acts as soulful rockers Chicano Batman and Bronx DJs The Martinez Brothers, they make this the greatest number of Latin artists to perform at Coachella in the same year. \nFollowing the lead of Viva Presents' Contreras, the festival seems to be avoiding mere tokenism. It also has added several non-Latin Viva Pomona! regulars, including Shannon & the Clams, Surf Curse and Slow Hollows, making the Coachella lineup better represent the mixed listening habits of today's younger audiences. \n\"It's like we had two glasses of water and they were the same size and we just got a bigger glass and dumped both glasses of water in there,\" Contreras says of the way traditional barriers between Latin and Anglo alternative music continue to break down. \"All the molecules are in one glass of water, and that's the revolution.\" Sarah Bennett is a contributor at the L.A.
