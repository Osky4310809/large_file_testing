Champ asks on Twitter By Dino Maragay (philstar.com)   1:08pm Manny Pacquiao is choosing among Amir Khan, Jeff Horn, Terence Crawford and Kell Brook as his next opponent. \nMANILA, Philippines – Manny Pacquiao is turning to his fans for help in determining his next opponent. \nThe WBO welterweight champion took to Twitter on Monday to ask his over 100,000 followers who should he face in his planned ring return this April. \nUsing Twitter’s poll feature, Pacquiao listed Amir Khan, Jeff Horn, Terrence Crawford and Kell Brook as his choices. Who do you want me to fight next in the UAE? \n— Manny Pacquiao (@mannypacquiao) February 12, 2017 \nKhan, whom Pacquiao has previously sparred with and who also used to train under Freddie Roach, has long wanted to lock horns with the Filipino. The British star (31-4, with 19 KOs) hasn’t fought since getting knocked out by a much stronger Saul Alvarez when he challenged the middleweight champion in May last year.   \nHorn (16-0-1, with 11 KOs), a relatively unknown Australian prospect, is ironically the frontrunner to fight Pacquiao. Pacquiao’s adviser Michael Koncz recently said he’s “100 percent” sure that Pacquiao will take on the 28-year-old Horn in the United Arab Emirates. \nHorn’s representatives, meanwhile, said they are still in talks with Top Rank Inc. boss Bob Arum to bring the fight to Australia, raising confusion with regards to the final venue. \nCrawford (30-0, with 21 KOs), for his part, is perhaps the most appealing opponent for Pacquiao. The undefeated rising star is currently the unified WBC and WBO super lightweight champion and widely considered as a dangerous foe for the ageing Pacquiao. \nThe 29-year-old Crawford has said he’s open for a clash with the 38-year-old Pacquiao but is not desperate enough to chase the Filipino for a megabuck showdown. \nLastly, Brook (36-1, with 25 KOs) has held the IBF welterweight diadem since 2014. Like his countryman Khan, he climbed some weight classes to test middleweight boss Gennady Golovkin but got stopped in their September 2016 collision. \nAs of posting time, Khan leads Pacquiao’s poll with 47 percent of the more than 10,000 votes, followed by Crawford (26 percent), Brook (22 percent) and Horn (5 percent). \nSo who should Pacquiao fight?
