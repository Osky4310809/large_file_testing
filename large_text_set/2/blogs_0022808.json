The event will be non-ticketed and free, so Londoners won't have to part with their cheddar to get in. \nMore than 25 independent retailers will be showcasing their finest food and drink in Victory Park, Stratford, on April 1 and 2. \nVisitors will get to sample and purchase artisan cheeses, chutneys, wines, beers and ciders from around the world, and there’ll even be chocolatiers offering something sweet for afterwards. A new restaurant dedicated to cheese is opening in London \nHighlights include gourmet truffle cheese from Lombardy, a range of snacks from London’s own Jacob’s Ladder – who are a favourite at food markets across the capital – and sparkling wine from grower specialist Grays & Feather, who are a popular draw each week on the Southbank. \nFor those who want something else to drink, London brewery Meantime will be on hand with morbier and ciders. Besides the goods themselves, there will be cheese and wine workshops and talks across the weekend. Sounds brie-lliant. \nFor more information, visit eastvillagelondon.co.uk 6 cheese and wine pairings every Londoner should know 6 cheese and wine pairings every Londoner should know 1/7 Click through our gallery to discover the cheese and wine pairings you should know... Shutterstock 2/7 Tunworth from Neal’s Yard \nA cow’s cheese with a rich, buttery flavour and a lot of texture. I love it with big Italian reds from the Puglia region Why: The sweet fruit in the wine complements the rich, buttery flavour and its noticeable acidity means the fat of the cheese doesn’t cloy on the palate. This wine also has more tannins than a Pinot Noir and therefore complements the added texture and weight of this cheese. Try it with: Aged Bordeaux reds, Beaujolais, Cab Sauvignon, Champagne, Sauvignon Blanc, Cider. 3/7 St James from Cartmel Cheeses \nSt James has a meaty, sweet and salty flavour with a chewy, creamy yet slightly firm texture. I love it with Gerwurtztraminer Why: The flamboyantly opulent aromas, textures and flavours of the wine go perfectly with the flavours, body and aromas of the cheese. Gewurztraminer is one of the most cheese-friendly wines – it can be paired brilliantly with cow, sheep and goats cheese. Try it with: Burgundy red with aged cheese, Burgundy white with young cheese, Champagne, Sauternes, Marc de Bourgogne which is made from the left over pressings of burgundy wine grapes. 4/7 Ragstone from Neal’s Yard \nA mild and Creamy Goat’s Cheese I love it with Sauvignon de Touraine Why: The crisp acidity, flintiness, delicate grassy nature of the wine complements the creamy, fresh, delicate flavours of creamy goats cheese. Avoid oaked wines as they would completely dominate the experience. Try it with: Sauvignon Blanc from California, Pouilly Fume, Rose, Pinot gris, Beer, Beaujolais. 5/7 Cheddar Montgomerys from Paxton and Whitfield \nA cow’s cheese with a complex, nutty and caramelised flavour I love it with Pinot Noir Why: Pinot Noir has mellow tannins which won’t clash with the cheese. It’s ripe fruit and slightly earthy nature complete the complex, nutty flavour of the Cheddar without overpowering it. Try it with: Burgundy, white esp Aligote, dry Riesling, Sancerre, Saint Emilion, Vintage Port. Shutterstock \nA rich, creamy and sharp and tangy cheese which is salty in flavour I love it with a glass of LBV Port Why: Both have good weight and body to them and are fairly complex in flavour. The fruity sweetness of the port rounds out the pungent salty tang of the cheese and adds an extra dimension to it. The youth, good acidity and zest of the port can also cut through the creamy butter fat of the Beauvale meaning it doesn’t cloy and the tannins of the port don’t clash. Try it with: Sauternes, sweet full-bodied wines, Riesling, Late Harvet wines, Chateauneuf-du-Pape. 7/7 Baron Bigod from Neal’s Yard \nA bloomy rind, cow’s milk, creamy with subtle hints of hazelnut and fruit aromas I love it with Prosecco Why: Bubbles go great with high fat foods since they crisp the palate. The acidity cuts through the fat but the fruity nature of the prosecco brings out the delicate fruit aromas. Try: Champagne, Blanc de Blancs, rosé, dry Riesling, Beaujolais, Pinot Noir.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:09:10.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
