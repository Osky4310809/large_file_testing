Federer advanced to the semi-finals via walkover when Nick Kyrgios withdrew. Federer is playing at an untouchable level. His shots are beautifully-struck, taken early, and placed with purpose. He is peaking at 35. — Nick Nemeroff (@NNemeroff) March 19, 2017 At age of 35, Roger Federer is oldest player ever to win an ATP Masters (34yo Andre Agassi at Cincinnati 2004). Beats Stan Wawrinka 6-4 7-5. — Stuart Fraser (@stu_fraser) March 19, 2017 Federer still far from No. 1 on the computer but he's No. 1 in 2017. Next up Miami, with no Djokovic or Murray (or Monfils) — Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) March 19, 2017 More Federer: \"I came here for the first time 17 years ago. To be the champion again, I can’t tell you what it means to me.\" #BNPPO17 — BNP Paribas Open (@BNPPARIBASOPEN) March 19, 2017 \nIn an all-Russian women’s final, Elena Vesnina defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-7 (6), 7-5, 6-4. \nVesnina had never advanced beyond the third round in singles and just last year she lost in the first round of qualifying, although she has won three doubles titles at the tournament. She beat No. 2 seed Angelique Kerber and No. 12 Venus Williams on her way to the biggest final of her career at age 30. Kuznetsova is 0-3 in finals here, also finishing runner-up in 2007 and 2008. At age 31, Kuznetsova was the fifth-oldest women to reach the final. But the two-time major champion struggled playing with the lead as the No. 8 seed in front of hundreds of empty seats. \n“I didn’t feel good today because she was very aggressive and I was a little bit out of my game,” Kuznetsova said. “I couldn’t figure out a lot the wind and stuff like that. But still, I give a lot of credit to her because she was aggressive.” Kuznetsova led 4-2 in the third before 14th-seeded Vesnina broke her twice in sweeping the final four games of the match. \nKuznetsova served one of her nine aces to lead 4-1 in the second, prompting Vesnina to bring out her coach-father Sergey Vesnin for a chat. It worked. \nVesnina reeled off four straight games to lead 5-4. Her forehand error led to Kuznetsova’s break in the 10th game that tied it 5-all. But Vesnina broke back and served out the set 7-5. \nKuznetsova had luck on her side early, winning the first set on a net cord in the tie-breaker. She gave the traditional wave acknowledging her good fortune to Vesnina, who had blown leads of 2-0 and 4-2. \nVesnina had 46 winners and 49 unforced errors. She successfully gambled at the net, winning 24 of 32 points during the three-hour match. \n“I tried my best and she won because she was more aggressive,” Kuznetsova said. “I was too passive. That’s it. Too much behind and didn’t serve well.” Vesnina earned $1,175,505 for her third career singles title and will move up two spots to a career-high No. 13 in the world rankings on Monday. The only other all-Russian women’s final was in 2006, when Maria Sharapova beat Elena Dementieva.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T01:52:42.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
