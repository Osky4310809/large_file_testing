Maybe Black & Decker's first entry into the field -- the Smartech Robotic Vacuum on display at CES -- can fill that void. Robot vacuums Dyson 360 Eye \nSure, we quite like models from iRobot and Neato , but expect to shell out $700 plus for a current gen model and upward of $500 even for an older Neato. Starting in March, you'll be able to buy any one of four new Black & Decker bots priced between $300 and $400. \nAt the top of the range, the $400 Smartech bot has features competitive with iRobot and Neato. Like the recent Neato Botvac Connected and Roomba 980 , you can steer the Smartech bot with an app on your phone and set a schedule for it. \nBetter yet, the $400 Smartech bot senses whether it's vacuuming carpet or hardwood and switches modes automatically, something neither iRobot nor Neato can do. We saw Smartech debuted on stick vacuums at CES last year . The rest of its specs are competitive as well. 90 minutes of battery life 1-liter dust bin Three cleaning modes: Auto, Quick and Spot Clean Anti-tangle bristles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:50:06.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
