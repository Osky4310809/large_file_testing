The latest transfer rumours from around the world. \nThings change in the blink of an eye in football. The Football Whispers Index takes the latest transfer rumours and gives them a score out of five; the higher the score, the more realistic and reliable the whisper. \nHere are today's top five emerging whispers for the summer. And keep an eye on Transfer Talk for the latest gossip. \nCedric Soares to Barcelona \nSouthampton's Cedric Soares is on Barcelona's shortlist of right-backs ahead of the summer transfer window, according to the Daily Telegraph. Barca are considering strengthening that position at the end of the season, after having had problems there since Dani Alves left. Aleix Vidal had finally made that position his own but he is now out for the rest of the season with an ankle injury, while Sergi Roberto is yet to properly convince after being switched there from midfield. The Spanish giants would reportedly have to offer at least £15 million to tempt Southampton into negotiations. \nKevin Gameiro to Tottenham \nThe Daily Mirror says Atletico Madrid have put striker Kevin Gameiro up for sale. The 29-year-old joined Diego Simeone's side in a £35 million deal from Sevilla last summer and although he scored an outstanding five-minute hat trick in the weekend win over Sporting Gijon, he has largely disappointed in scoring just six other La Liga goals. Atleti are reported to have sounded out a number of top European clubs about a potential move for the Frenchman, including Tottenham. And Spurs may be interested if they are looking for top-class competition to compete with Harry Kane, after Vincent Janssen has failed to impress at White Hart Lane. \nWojciech Szczesny to Borussia Dortmund \nPolish sports daily Przeglad Sportowy claims Borussia Dortmund are one of three clubs where Wojciech Szczesny may end up. The goalkeeper is on loan at Roma from Arsenal for the second consecutive season, but the Italian side are unlikely to pay the Gunners' £13.5 million asking price. That has made him a transfer target for Dortmund, but they'll face competition from Juventus and Napoli, who are also reportedly interested in the 26-year-old. \nLucas Perez to Everton \nEverton are on red alert after Lucas Perez's agent suggested he is unhappy with his lack of playing time. The Daily Mail says that Everton were interested in Perez in the summer, but were beaten to him by the Gunners. Since his move to the Emirates, the Spaniard has made just two Premier League starts and Everton boss Ronald Koeman hopes to take advantage of his lack of minutes. \nNicolas Otamendi to Real Madrid \nNicolas Otamendi's agent has claimed Real Madrid are interested in the Manchester City centre-back. Martin Sendoa says the Argentine would be perfect for Zinedine Zidane's side, with Pepe set to leave Los Blancos in the summer. \"Pepe is leaving Real Madrid and Otamendi fits the profile they are looking for,\" Sendoa told Radio Continental. \"Nico is happy at Manchester City, but who wouldn't want to play at Real Madrid? It's the biggest club in the world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:27:55.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
