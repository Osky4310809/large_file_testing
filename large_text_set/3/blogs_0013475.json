That surprising price is for a rear-wheel-drive base model with 240 miles of all-electric range. Lucid Motors announced the pricing Wednesday as part of its new blog series on the upstart electric-vehicle project. Prices for a higher-trim, all-wheel-drive model with larger batteries and more horsepower will run in the six-figure range. \n-The base Lucid Air will have 12-way power front seats and a 10-speaker audio system. The interior will be outfitted with four screens, three of which will be interactive touchscreens. Other standard features for the base model include 19-inch wheels as well as hardware to make it capable of autonomous driving.\n-“The base-model car will be well appointed and enjoyable to drive,” Zak Edson, Lucid Motors’ director of marketing, wrote in the blog post. “It will provide superior comfort, a better user interface, and better performance than comparably priced BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes . As at Tesla , which Lucid Motors aims to compete with, the cars will receive over-the-air software updates.\n-But there’s much more beyond the base model. The uplevel Lucid gets a twin-motor configuration with all-wheel drive and up to 1000 horsepower. Battery options will offer ranges of 315 and 400 miles. There also will be luxury add-ons such as a glass-canopy roof; 22-way power front seats with heating, ventilation, and massage; special 21-inch wheels; and a 29-speaker audio system. Buyers of fancier models also can expect additional leather trim and other material upgrades. “The price of a fully loaded Air will be above $100,000, but we are not yet able to provide specific top-of-the-line pricing,” Edson wrote.\n- - Rarefied Air: Lucid’s New Car Just Might Be the Real Deal - Tesla Owners, Will Lucid Make Your Next Electric Car? - Lucid (Formerly Known as Atieva) Will Be the Sole Battery-Pack Supplier for Formula E - -An initial run of 255 Launch Edition models will have special badging and color schemes. The company is taking online deposits—$25,500 to reserve a Launch Edition car or $2500 for the standard model—on its website . Lucid Motors plans to build 10,000 units in the first year, with production slated to begin in the first half of 2019—giving plenty of time for EV enthusiasts to decide just how Air they can afford.\n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:09:33.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
