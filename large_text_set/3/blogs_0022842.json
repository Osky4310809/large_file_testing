Below are key takeaways from that analysis, in which the CBO partnered with the Joint Committee on Taxation. It compares the cost and coverage projections over the next 10 years if we keep the existing law to what those projections would be if the GOP proposal becomes law. 1. Fourteen million will lose insurance next year. \nThere are two reasons for that, according to the CBO: the repeal of the individual mandate and a rise in premiums. \nFrom the analysis: \"CBO and JCT estimate that, in 2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured under the legislation than under current law. Most of that increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with the individual mandate. Some of those people would choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying the penalties, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums.\" 2. Seven million more will lose coverage by 2020, and another 3 million by 2026. \nThat's largely because of changes to Medicaid. The CBO expects some states that have expanded Medicaid will reverse course. Others that would have probably done so under Obamacare will change their minds. And thirdly, changes to the way Medicaid will be administered — allowing the states to tighten coverage rules — will kick some who would have been eligible for Medicaid under existing law to no longer be eligible, irrespective of whether states accept the expansion or not. From the report: \"The reductions in insurance coverage between 2018 and 2026 would stem in large part from changes in Medicaid enrollment — because some states would discontinue their expansion of eligibility, some states that would have expanded eligibility in the future would choose not to do so, and per-enrollee spending in the program would be capped. In 2026, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law.\" 3. Obamacare is not collapsing. But the GOP plan won't destabilize the markets, either. \nDespite talk of Obamacare's impending collapse, replacing Obamacare is not expected to make a difference in the stability of health insurance markets for people who aren't covered by plans provided by employers. Either way, the market for nongroup policies is expected to remain stable in most areas. \nFrom the CBO: \"The market for insurance purchased individually [that is, nongroup coverage] would be unstable, for example, if the people who wanted to buy coverage at any offered price would have average health care expenditures so high that offering the insurance would be unprofitable. In CBO and JCT's assessment, however, the nongroup market would probably be stable in most areas under either current law or the legislation.\" 4. Under Obamacare, that stability is provided by the individual mandate and poor and middle-class subsidies. From the CBO: \"The subsidies to purchase coverage combined with the penalties paid by uninsured people stemming from the individual mandate are anticipated to cause sufficient demand for insurance by people with low health care expenditures for the market to be stable.\" 5. Under the GOP legislation the markets would be stable, but for different reasons. \nThe new subsidies would be less generous for the poor, but still provide sufficient incentives for enough healthy people to enroll to stabilize the system, especially when combined with grants to hospitals. \nFrom the CBO: \"Under the legislation, in the agencies' view, key factors bringing about market stability include subsidies to purchase insurance, which would maintain sufficient demand for insurance by people with low health care expenditures, and [federal] grants to states , which would reduce the costs to insurers of people with high health care expenditures. Even though the new tax credits would be structured differently from the current subsidies and would generally be less generous for those receiving subsidies under current law, the other changes would, in the agencies' view, lower average premiums enough to attract a sufficient number of relatively healthy people to stabilize the market.\" 6. Talk of skyrocketing costs under Obamacare can be misleading. \nThe CBO has found that most people who buy insurance through the program are \"largely insulated\" from rising premiums. \nFrom the CBO: \"Under current law, most subsidized enrollees purchasing health insurance coverage in the nongroup market are largely insulated from increases in premiums because their out-of-pocket payments for premiums are based on a percentage of their income; the government pays the difference.\" 7. Premiums would go up faster under the GOP legislation than if Obamacare were left in place because of the elimination of the individual mandate.

(File Photo/Staff) \nUntil 2020, the premiums would cost 15 to 20 percent more than under Obamacare. But that begins to change in 2020, and by 2026, average premiums under the GOP plan would cost about 10 percent less than what they'd cost under Obamacare.This is because of federal grants to states that the CBO expects will be used to offset costs to insurers for very expensive claims, and because the new law will allow insurers to offer weaker (and therefore less expensive) insurance plans than are currently allowed. In turn, the availability of cheaper plans is likely to increase participation by young people. \nFrom the CBO: \"Starting in 2020, the increase in average premiums from repealing the individual mandate penalties would be more than offset by the combination of several factors that would decrease those premiums: grants to states from the Patient and State Stability Fund (which CBO and JCT expect to largely be used by states to limit the costs to insurers of enrollees with very high claims); the elimination of the requirement for insurers to offer plans covering certain percentages of the cost of covered benefits; and a younger mix of enrollees.\" 8. Why would plans under the new law be 'weaker' than current coverage options? \nThey wouldn't have to be. But the new law would remove the requirement that qualifying insurance plans cover at least 60 percent of the cost of a covered procedure. This would allow plans that cover only very small portions of medical bills to newly count as coverage. \nFrom the CBO: \"Removing the requirement, beginning in 2020, that insurers who offer plans in the nongroup and small-group markets generally must offer plans that cover at least 60 percent of the cost of covered benefits.\" 9. The lower premiums after 2020 won't be enjoyed evenly . \nOlder Americans will typically pay more than they would under Obamacare, and younger ones are likely to pay less. \nThe new law would allow insurance companies to set premiums as much as five times higher for older customers than what younger customers pay for the same policy. Under Obamacare, that is limited to three times. This difference can add up quickly. If a monthly premium for a young person is now $400, before subsidies, the same coverage can be priced no more than $1,200 per month, before subsidies, for an older person. Under the new law, a company could be able to charge the older customer $2,000 for coverage that someone younger pays just $400 for. \nFrom the CBO: \"Although average premiums would increase prior to 2020 and decrease starting in 2020, CBO and JCT estimate that changes in premiums relative to those under current law would differ significantly for people of different ages because of a change in age-rating rules. Under the legislation, insurers would be allowed to generally charge five times more for older enrollees than younger ones rather than three times more as under current law, substantially reducing premiums for young adults and substantially raising premiums for older people.\" 10. The new law would replace the individual mandate with a heavy penalty for any who fail to keep insurance current. \nNo one would be required to buy insurance under the new law, but if you fail to do so, the next time you choose to buy insurance, you will pay a hefty fee. The surcharge will go to the insurance company and not to the government. \nFrom the CBO: \"Requiring insurers to apply a 30 percent surcharge on premiums for people who enroll in insurance in the nongroup or small-group markets if they have been uninsured for more than 63 days within the past year.\" 11. The new plan would achieve a net savings for the U.S. treasury of $337 billion between 2017 and 2026. \nThat's because the government would spend $1.2 trillion less on health care, and forgo $883 billion in revenue currently tied to Obamacare. \nFrom the CBO: \"CBO and JCT estimate that, on net, enacting the legislation would decrease federal deficits by $337 billion over the 2017-2026 period. That change would result from a $1.2 trillion decrease in direct spending, partially offset by an $883 billion reduction in revenues.\" 12. The GOP plan will mean 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026. Source: Congressional Budget Office 2017 scoring of American Healthcare Act. \nUnder Obamacare, 31 states, plus the District of Columbia, have taken advantage of the enhanced Medicaid reimbursements offered by the federal government in return for the states' agreeing to ease eligibility requirements. Those expansions mean that about 50 percent of the American population who meet the conditions of the newly relaxed eligibility requirements are covered. The CBO expects that in the next few years, more states will do so and that universe will expand to 80 percent of all American residents who would meet those new requirements if their states agreed to expand the program. Under the GOP plan, however, the CBO expects no new states to expand Medicaid eligibility, and some who have already agreed to do so will reverse course. Both those factors will reduce the number of Americans insured by Medicaid by 2026. The reason states will shy away from the Medicaid expansion if the GOP proposal becomes law is that the federal government will provide a smaller subsidy to pay for the medical bills of each new Medicaid enrollee. That won't happen overnight, since anyone covered now will be grandfathered in as the new law takes effect. But as current beneficiaries die, they will be replaced by new enrollees, who will cost the states more. In addition, any break in coverage will thrust even longtime Medicaid beneficiaries into the ranks of new enrollees. The CBO estimates that fewer than one-third of those enrolled as of Dec. 31, 2019, would have maintained continuous coverage eligibility two years later. From the report: \"Under the legislation, the higher federal matching rate would apply for fewer than 5 percent of newly eligible enrollees by the end of 2024, CBO estimates.\" 13. There is a third reason why Medicaid coverage will dwindle under the new GOP plan. \nUnder the proposed law, the federal government will cap its contributions to states according to a formula specifically designed to not keep pace with the rising cost of medical care. That is, states' costs for the same coverage will go up year after year faster than their reimbursements from the federal government. \nThat's on purpose. Proponents hope that will encourage efficiency and imaginative cost savings. But it is also likely to force the states to reduce benefits to keep covering the same number of people, or greatly tighten eligibility to reduce the number of people covered by Medicaid. From the CBO: \"Under current law ... if a state spends more because enrollment increases or costs per enrollee rise, additional federal payments are automatically generated. Under the legislation, beginning in 2020, the federal government would establish a limit on the amount of reimbursement it provides to states. ... If a state spent more than the limit on federal reimbursement, the federal government would provide no additional funding to match that spending. The limit on federal reimbursement would reduce outlays because ... Medicaid spending would grow on a per-enrollee basis at a faster rate than the (consumer price index increases in federal contributions) — at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent for Medicaid and 3.7 percent for the CPI-M over the 2017-2026 period.\" 14. It probably will be harder to shop for insurance under the GOP plan. \nRemember healthcare.gov and its disastrous rollout? Well, the website eventually got better. And now, Obamacare makes comparing one policy to another simple. All policies are rated either Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum depending on whether they cover (roughly) 60, 70, 80 or 90 percent of medical costs for covered care. That makes comparisons among policies within those bands relatively simple. In addition, all policies are made available on a single web site. \nUnder the new law, the tax credits will be available no matter where one buys insurance, thus making it likely that insurance companies will stop selling their policies through the common marketplaces and instead just sell them directly to the insured. \nFrom the CBO: \"Under the legislation, some of the ways that the nongroup market functions would change for consumers. The current ... requirements help people compare different insurance plans, because all plans in a tier cover the same share of costs, on average. CBO and JCT expect that, under the legislation, plans would be harder to compare, making shopping for a plan on the basis of price more difficult. Another feature ... under current law is that there is one central website through the state or federal marketplace where people can shop for all the plans in their area that are eligible for subsidies. Under the legislation, insurers participating in the nongroup market would no longer have to offer plans through the marketplaces in order for people to receive subsidies toward those plans; therefore, CBO and JCT estimate that fewer would do so. With more plans that are eligible for subsidies offered directly from insurers or directly through agents and brokers and not through the marketplaces' central websites, shopping for and comparing plans could be harder, depending on insurers' decisions about how to market their plans.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:13:50.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
