A series of clues accompanied each set of baby pictures before finally revealing which actor the pictures belonged to. When compared with a more recent photo, it is surprising to see how little each actor’s appearance has changed over the years. \nFirst up was “ D-Day ” actress Kim Jung Hwa, rocking a pretty adorable fringe and some of her famous striking visuals. \n“ Doctors ” star Park Shin Hye’s photos proved that she is a force to be reckoned, taking charge both on the playground and behind the wheel of her toy Porsche. \nLastly, actor Kim Kang Hyun, who currently appears on “ Chief Kim ,” is all personality, sticking out his tongue at the camera as his picture is taken. \nThe post ends with well wishes from the agency and a handwritten Lunar New Year greeting from Park Shin Hye that reads, “Freshly starting 2017. Love, health, and happiness. I’m always beside you all. Happy New Year!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:55:21.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
