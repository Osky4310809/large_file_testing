Lovecraft–inspired honey ale . Now you can even get your fix from '80s pop star-turned-accidental meme Rick Astley. Astley—best known for his hit song, \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" and the Rickrolling phenomenon it later sparked—has been mulling over the idea of putting out his own beer. \n“I enjoy a beer with friends, and I’m hoping to sell my own brand soon,” Astley told The Mirror . The singer will be teaming up with Mikkeller, a Danish brewery founded by a teacher 10 years ago. “Mikkeller beer is quite experimental, and they’ve been sending me various bottles to sample. Some are quite fruity—one was a pear beer they make for a restaurant, but we’ve gone for a pilsner type lager.” \nAstley mentioned that he is still deciding on a name. (Our suggestion? \"Never Gonna Give You Hops.\") \nWill Rickrolling take on a new form in the shape of a beer bottle? Soon friends can pull the bait-and-switch prank at the bar by promising one beer and returning with Astley's branded brew instead.
