. \nWe assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election, Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency…We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump…Moscow's approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on Russia's understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below There's no supporting evidence in the report that was released on Friday. That last part is interesting, if predictable. I've long believed that, Tsarist, Communist, or autocratic, Russia behaves pretty much the way it has behaved since Peter The Great. But this is a whole different bit of business. It's time for progressives to stop quibbling. The president-elect has to condemn this, openly and categorically. The Republican leadership in the Congress has to be right behind him while he does it. His transition team needs to release everything it knows about their end of this business, and they have to waive immunity and open themselves up to questioning by the special committee of the Congress that this information demands. If none of these things happen, then the transition team, the president-elect for which it works, and the congressional majorities that share its party affiliation have failed the country and have forfeited a good part of their political legitimacy. Most Popular But, no, the president-elect is deflecting towards NBC , and Paul Ryan's knee-jerk reaction about \"partisanship\" will simply not do. If the president-elect is delegitimized, it's on him now. It's time to start acting worthy of the office he's going to hold. Another gun, more dead people, this time at the airport in Fort Lauderdale. From CNN : \nHe was a lone shooter and we have no evidence at this time that he was acting with anyone else,\" Barbara Sharief, a Broward County commissioner, told CNN.Witnesses told news outlets that the gunman, who appeared to be a man in his 20s wearing a \"Star Wars\" T-shirt, had been firing into the crowd at baggage claim. The Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, said that no shots were fired by law enforcement, countering reports that the gunman had been shot by the police. Sheriff Israel said at a news conference that the gunman was arrested without incident. John Schlicher, who told MSNBC that he witnessed the attack, described the gunman as a \"slender man\" who was \"directly firing at us\" while passengers waited for their bags to come off the carousel. Apparently, the guy flew from Alaska to Florida. His gun was in his checked baggage, which he is allowed to do because Second Amendment. So he picks up his bag, takes out his piece, loads it in the bathroom, and ventilates a bunch of his fellow passengers. Somehow, I don't think it's likely the guy adhered to the TSA guidelines . Or maybe he did. It doesn't really matter. Does this strike anyone else besides me as the world's easiest and most predictable mass murder? Guns and this country, man. I just don't know.

From the Beeb : \nSince 1 January, state-funded Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) has been filling its airwaves with classical pieces, jazz and traditional folk music instead, the Novinite news agency reports. It's locked in a dispute with the non-profit Musicautor organisation, which manages the rights to work by both local and international artists - 14 million pieces of music in total. Even the traditional version of the national anthem is off-limits. Listeners tuning in on New Year's Eve instead heard the BNR symphony orchestra and choir's take on the tune, Balkan Insight reports , adding that the copyright row means only music made before 1945 can be played. BNR itself says it cannot play \"95% of today's modern music repertoire\". Musicautor wants BNR to pay more in royalties - triple the amount it pays at the moment - to bring it more into line with national radio in other EU countries. But radio director Aleksander Velev says that's impossible unless it gets more funding or drops a regional broadcast, which would \"tarnish the radio's public mission.\" Somebody owns the copyright on the Bulgarian National Anthem and it's not the Bulgarian government? This is even better than Michael Jackson owning the Beatles catalog. Whose investment advisor is that far-sighted and how can I hire him? There was some talk up in the Commonwealth (God save it!), most of it from Republicans, that Senator Professor Warren was going to hang it up after one term. On Friday, she put all that to rest. From The Boston Globe : \nThe people of Massachusetts didn't send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country. This is no time to quit. Of course, this doesn't mean we will lack for entertainment. Warren has remained popular in Massachusetts, but could face a challenge from Curt Schilling, the former Red Sox pitcher turned conservative firebrand who has said he plans a Republican bid. Requests sent to Schilling for comment were not immediately answered.

Via WEEI : \nMiller contended that in numerous off-the-record conversations, former teammates and executives who knew Schilling said he was a terrible teammate, which prompted the scumbag line, which was really just a repurposing of an adjective Schilling has used to describe writers. \n\"Should I really put this guy over the top who is a scumbag?\" Miller asked. \"I've never really used the character clause. I thought to myself, you know what, he doesn't deserve my vote, because of the way he was as a teammate.\" Countered Schilling: \"This is why I don't lose sleep over this. When you understand human beings like this guy have a control over the Hall of Fame vote … they invoke the character clause randomly. This is why I don't lose sleep.\" Most Popular Bothered? Him? Unpossible! Not even losing sleep over it. Jeebus Christmas, just vote the guy in so he'll have to shut up about something. Speaking of Halls of Fame, we haven't yet discussed this year's nominees for the Wenner Museum Of Popular Music out in Cleveland. For a number of reasons, Tupac is probably a lock and so is Journey (?), for a number of completely opposite reasons. ELO's in. My personal hobby horse is the J Geils Band because they're local and because, if we must have a R&R Hall of Fame, there has to be room for kickass live acts simply because they were kickass live acts. And I continue to believe that the only possible explanation for Warren Zevon's continued absence from the list of nominees is that he once ate Jann Wenner's puppy on stage. In 1838, a guy named Thomas Green Clemson became the son-in-law of John C. Calhoun, who was a big noise in the world of theoretical sedition, as you may recall. Fifty years later, he left all his estate to South Carolina for the purposes of establishing an agricultural and technical college, modeled after the one already up and running in Mississippi. Fortunately for the new university, while S.C. was \"away\" for a while, the United States of America had passed the Morrill Act that established a system of land-grant universities and, in 1887, they had reinforced the system with the Hatch Act. In 1893, Clemson Agricultural College opened.

Now beat those elitists from Alabama like the cake-eaters they are. Do it for Justin Smith Morrill, who was an abolitionist. Weekly WWOZ Pick To Click: \"Georgia Morning Dew\" (Johnny Adams): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans. Weekly Visit To The Pathe Archives: Here's FDR, chowing down with some folks at a CCC camp in 1933 and having an altogether splendid time, too. Used to have presidents like that, or so they tell me. History is so cool. The whole thing with WikiLeaks has passed the point of democratic transparency and now it's headed headlong into nihilistic vandalism, to say nothing of what appears to be frantic, sweaty desperation. They're scrambling, issuing threats of all sorts, and generally behaving like people who've been caught up to their elbows in the cookie jar. They're going to sue CNN and they're \"considering\" doxing people, just for, you know, evolving democracy or something. From inside the Ecuadorian embassy, Julian Assange seems to be running Jonestown from a laptop. And he's further muddling an already perilous situation regarding the legitimacy of the incoming administration, which doesn't have a lot of that in the first place and seems intent on burning what little it has to the ground. It's also got Nancy Pelosi saying genuinely impolitic things. From The Hill : \n\"I really say to you, my friends in the press, with all the respect for the guardians of the First Amendment that you are, that you were accomplices in this. Because every single day you reported that there was an email that was embarrassing to the Clinton [campaign] without saying, 'We know this because of disruption by a foreign power into our electoral system,'\" she said. \"You knew that. You knew it was the Russians.\" She happens to be way out over her skis in her rhetoric, but she's not wrong. The same thing happened in the 1990s with the people covering Ken Starr's investigation had the choice between publishing the leaks and writing about the web of connections between the special prosecutor's office and the network of rightwing \"elves\" that had been working to derail the Clinton presidency since before it had taken office. Anyway, if this is what \"disruption\" looks like, I'd like a do-over, please. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It's always a good day for dinosaur news, isn't it, USA Today ? \nScientists have found fossils and other tracks suggesting dinosaurs hunted cooperatively, but evidence for dinosaur behavior \"is still relatively rare, because we're talking about something we can't see,\" says Brent Breithaupt, a Wyoming-based regional paleontologist for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. And whatever happened at this spot one day in the Cretaceous, \"tracks are the first good step – excuse the pun – into learning about what animals were there.\" The predator tracks were first discovered a decade ago in a rugged corner of New Mexico overseen by the land-management bureau. The researchers found 13 prints left by three meat-eating dinosaurs: small, medium and large. I always hate to dine alone, too.
