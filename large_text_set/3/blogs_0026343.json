She’s consistently incorporating Coach looks in her everyday outfits and we’re consistently losing our paychecks over at Coach.com to recreate her style. While she’s expected to star in the spring 2017 ad campaign and collaborate with creative director Stuart Vevers on a “special design piece,” she did just work on a very sweet (and secretive) project with the Coach Foundation.\nCoach’s national charity partner is an organization called Step Up , which helps empower young women from under-resourced communities. Two L.A. high schools (Alliance Margaret M. Bloomfield High School and Alliance Leichtman-Levine Environmental Science High School) that participate in Step Up hosted Coach’s CEO Victor Luis as a mentor for a day. What the students didn’t know was that he would also be joined by Gomez herself!\n@instagram is celebrating world kindness day and I got to spend it with people who fully will change our world one day. @coach introduced me to @stepupwomensnetwork which is an after school organization that encourages girls to believe that they have the capability to do anything they set their mind to. It's crazy to me how much they are willing put others before themselves. # #CoachXStepUP #DreamBig \nA post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Mar 23, 2017 at 6:09pm PDT\nThe singer-actress joined Luis and Step Up CEO Jenni Luke in leading a Step Up curriculum lesson to promote confidence and help students realize their potential and capabilities.\nRELATED PHOTOS: Where to Buy That Dinosaur Sweater You’ve Seen on All Your Favorite Stars \n“I am truly thrilled to be involved with Coach and their support of Step Up,” Gomez said in a statement. “Step Up’s mission to empower young women is personally important to me and something even more crucial in under-served communities. Working with the young women I met today was an inspirational experience I will never forget.”\nBut thanks to Gomez’s appearance, she no doubt inspired the young women in attendance. “Step Up aims to inspire girls and when we ask our girls to name an inspiring woman, Selena Gomez’s name pops up more than you could imagine,” says Luke. “Her participation through the Coach Foundation really helps underscore our message to the girls to realize their capabilities and fulfill their aspirations.”\nGomez’s next project, Netflix’s Thirteen Reasons Why, sheds a light on another topic close to Gomez, bullying, which will also help inspire and educate young girls.\nWhat do you think of Gomez’s surprise?
