The MailOnline website is owned and published in the United Kingdom, and has a principal office in New York, according to court documents. Trump’s attorneys tried to prove there was a direct connection with Maryland because the website receives 4,600 article views per hour in Maryland and 72,600 unique browsers per day from Maryland. \nBut ultimately Montgomery County Circuit Judge Sharon V. Burrell ruled that was not enough of a connection to establish jurisdiction. \nTrump’s representatives did not respond to BuzzFeed News request for comment. But a source familiar with the matter said her legal team planned to re-file the case against the Daily Mail in New York. \nTrump’s lawsuit against the blogger, meanwhile, is still moving forward. A 12-day trial for the case is scheduled for November. 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:52:08.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
