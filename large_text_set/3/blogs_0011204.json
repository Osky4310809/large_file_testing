These are returns for one year. It’s a federal return,” said Maddow, as she started her show. It turned out she only had two pages of the returns, though, when she revealed them. \nThey showed Trump paid $38 million in taxes, a tax rate of about 25 percent. A large portion of those taxes were the result of the “alternative minimum tax,” which Trump wants to eliminate, according to The Daily Beast. Without it, his taxes would have been about $5.3 million only, the returns show. Rachel Maddow. (Getty) \nAccording to TurboTax, the Alternative Minimum Tax “was designed to keep wealthy taxpayers from using loopholes to avoid paying taxes.” It became controversial because it was not automatically updated for inflation, more middle-class taxpayers were getting hit with the AMT each year.” \nThroughout the presidential campaign and as president, Trump has consistently refused to release his tax returns, generally claiming he’s been advised not to do so because he’s under audit. The White House slammed the MSNBC report, saying the returns were illegally obtained but not denying they were authentic. \nMaddow released the two pages on her show March 14, which started at 9 p.m. EST. She started the show by revealing she did, in fact, have some of the returns, but then launched into a lengthy string of questions she has about Trump’s supposed ties to foreign governments and a Russian oligarch, his choice of Michael Flynn as national security adviser in the past, and other inquiries. \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. Maddow Tweeted That She Had the Tax Returns From 2005 & Added ‘Seriously’ at the End of the Tweet & Then Showed Two Pages (Photo by Pete Marovich – Pool/Getty Images) \nMaddow released a tweet saying she had Trump’s tax returns, something she reiterated on her show (it’s still underway, and this article is being updated as more information is learned). When she finally did the big release, it turned out that she had only two pages of the tax returns. \nMaddow summarized what they show this way: She said Trump paid $38 million in taxes. “He took a big write down of $103 million. If you add up the lines for income he made more than $150 million in that year,” she said, waving the pages for the television cameras. \nShe admitted that a “full tax return for someone like Donald Trump would be a lot longer than what we have here.” \nHere’s the original Maddow tweet. BREAKING: We've got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC. \n(Seriously). \n— Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 14, 2017 \nSome said other returns (or fuller ones) would tell much more. Rachel Maddow doing the best with one old Trump return. The missing returns 2006-2016 plus audit reports/adjustments tell much, much more. \n— Mike Ponsford (@ponsford_mike) March 15, 2017 \nMaddow’s lengthy preamble at the start of her program started with how she believes that Trump’s “explanations have never made sense.” She questioned why the president “hasn’t released any tax returns. When you get an excuse from them that hasn’t made sense, you have to look for another reason.” \nShe added, “There is genuine curiosity” whether Trump’s tax returns match things he has said about himself. Some people wondered what was taking so long. We're 10 minutes into Rachel Maddow's big scoop on Donald Trump's taxes, and so far she's asked 1,000 questions and answered none of them. \n— Gregory Korte (@gregorykorte) March 15, 2017 \nAfter 20 minutes of preamble, she took a break and said she would reveal what the returns show when she comes back. When she did, she revealed she had the two pages, quickly summarized them, and then moved into commentary and further questions she has for Trump. \nWatch the Maddow show moment here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:56:15.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
