During that time, there were 244,787 admissions during Joint Commission inspections, and 1,462,339 in the three weeks before and after.\nThey found that in the non-inspection weeks, the average 30-day death rate was 7.21 percent. But during inspections, the rate fell to 7.03 percent. The difference was greater in teaching hospitals — 6.41 percent when the inspectors were absent, and 5.93 percent during survey weeks.\nThe effects were modest, ranging from a relative decrease of 1.5 percent over all to 5.9 percent in large teaching hospitals. Still, with 900,000 annual Medicare admissions, an absolute reduction of only 0.39 percent in the death rate would mean more than 3,500 fewer deaths per year.\nAlthough the reasons for the effect are unclear, the lead author, Dr. Anupam B. Jena, an associate professor at Harvard, suggested that “when docs are being monitored, the focus and attention placed on clinical care goes up.
