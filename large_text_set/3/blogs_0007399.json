There’s just an incredible momentum about the program thanks to the success we’ve had over the last few years.” \nLast winter’s 20-5 record and Sweet 16 showing set the bar, which Rock Canyon has raised this year with big plays at decisive moments. \nSenior forward J.T. Bley drew a charge to void a game-winning shot by ThunderRidge at the buzzer of the Continental League championship Feb. 17. Last Saturday, senior guard Colin Rardin and junior guard Nick Janedis scored in the final five seconds, Janedis on a tip-in at the buzzer, in a victory over Grandview in a Great 8 showdown. \n“After we beat ThunderRidge, that court storming was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced,” said junior point guard Sam Masten, who leads Rock Canyon in scoring with 22.3 points per game. “And the game against Grandview was something I’ve never seen before. Both games are something we’ll never forget for our entire lives. But more than that, they’ve shown us that we can execute when the pressure is on.” \nRock Canyon also showed its poise in an early-season 60-55 victory over Eaglecrest. \nOne area the Jaguars have struggled at is maintaining leads against high-tempo teams. \n“We have to get better about playing with the lead and being able to understand shot selection when we’re ahead,” Grams said. “Plus Eaglecrest is so athletic, so it’s so hard to mimic their speed and their pressure in practice. We’ve been going 5-on-8, 5-on-9, whatever we can to try to put pressure on our starters so that hopefully they feel comfortable when Eaglecrest goes to that 2-3 extended zone or when they run the “Raptor,” which is their 1-2-2.” \nMasten will be a key player in providing the offensive spark as well as in defending Raptors standout Colbey Ross. Junior guard Tyson Gilbert is an X-factor. The transfer from Highlands Ranch gave the Jaguars backcourt a newfound versatility in the second half of the season. \n“It was such an easy transition for him to come from a rival school like he did, and that’s a credit to who he is as a person — he’s a humble guy who’s very unselfish,” Grams said. “With him on the floor, we’ve got another player who can handle the ball and take so much pressure off of Sam, who earlier on in the year had to handle the ball 95 percent of the time and would get tired by the fourth quarter.” \nBeyond the official roster, another key member of the team does more hopping around the locker room than the players. His name is Kirby, and he’s the team’s pet frog. Ever since Rardin and senior forward Carter Coonts acquired Kirby around midseason, the Jaguars went 10-1 down the stretch. \n“We put him in a cage in the locker room, but then he kind of escapes wherever when we’re in there,” Masten said. “He hasn’t really done too much damage yet, though. We play pranks on people with him, too, like putting him in a kid’s car or leaving him in a kid’s shoe. Crazy stuff.” \nThough Kirby will remain at Rock Canyon for the Final Four, the Jaguars aren’t done having fun just yet. \n“Kirby and all our shenanigans and pranks help us find a balance because at the end of the day, basketball’s a game you play to have fun, and we’d had so much fun this season,” Masten said. “But when it’s game time, we’ve been able to flip that switch and get the job done. It’ll be the same case on Friday night.” Rock Canyon High School \nAddress: 5810 McArthur Ranch Road, Highlands Ranch \nDistrict: Douglas County Schools", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:09:07.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
