Waider writes about the landscape in wondering tones on his blog : ‘This place is one of the most unique places I have seen in my life. Icebergs breaking off that massive glacier are sometimes so large, they seem like small floating countries – you could easily fit a small town on top of them’ Photograph: Jan Erik Waider ‘I was sailing on a small wooden fishing boat between icebergs the size of a 20-storey building and it felt like Manhattan made of ice without all the people’ Photograph: Jan Erik Waider ‘Also, the colours were different with every iceberg that came along. Depending on the age and pressure they were under, the colour ranged from black over blue and white to almost glass-like and transparent’ Photograph: Jan Erik Waider Despite travelling around all the Nordic region, Waider has chosen Iceland as his home Photograph: Jan Erik Waider Waider says he’s a ‘big fan of winter, with its unpredictable weather and the magical snow-covered landscapes. I like to be out in nature when most are happy to sit inside with a warm cup of tea in their hands’ Photograph: Jan Erik Waider The unpredictability of the winter weather makes for unique landscapes, a world away from the pictures of glaciers in travel guides Photograph: Jan Erik Waider Waider’s photography has been used by the likes of HTC, the British Museum and Bosch Photograph: Jan Erik Waider Waider also works as a user interface designer for websites and apps, and founded Presetbase Photograph: Jan Erik Waider You can see more of Waider’s landscape images at his website , also taking in Norway and the Faroe Islands Photograph: Jan Erik Waider", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:06:47.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
