The unnamed customer ordered burgers, fries with peppercorn ranch dressing, and—what’s this? He or she also got one cent deducted from the order total, with the reason given as “BEST BEARD.” Photo courtesy Imgur. \nIt might not be the world’s greatest discount, but you can’t argue with the glowing admiration in those all caps.

Back in 2012, International Business Times reported on another receipt from the chain showing that one cent had been slashed off the bill of a female customer who was deemed to have the “best butt.” A Reddit user claiming to work for the burger chain responded to say that such receipts were legit, as staff are allowed to add “fun discounts” onto customers’ bills. \nIt’s debatable how “fun” it is to objectify women’s bodies as they eat fried pickles, so let’s just hope that both she and the anonymous bearded diner enjoyed their compliments. And that the latter remembered to check his moustache for ranch dressing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:54:12.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
