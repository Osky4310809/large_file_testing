We built 1,930 of the water scheme across the state.” \nIt was Ohakim’s view that “the idea of the water project was to make sure there is water in every kitchen in Imo State.” \nBut he wondered why a water project would be abandoned by Okorocha’s administration but embarked on building”empty halls, substandard roads and people are left without good drinking water.” \nOhakim asked,”who will drive on the roads when they have no water to drink or if they die from diseases gotten from unclean water sources. \n“Where are the two generators we provided to pump water ? You can see that cables have been destroyed and vandalised, the whole place over grown with weeds and left to fall apart just because it was Ohakim’s project”, he added. \nIn what looks like an advice to Okorocha, Ohakim said:”Governance is about continuity and essentially for the benefit of the people and not for the ego of one single individual. \n“You cannot keep abandoning or destroying what Ohakim built for the people just because you want to erase Ohakim’s legacies.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T11:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T10:12:10.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
