The video below shows that apps can be launched by scrolling and lightly touching the side of the device. This is consistent with the concept video by Danelle Vermeulen released late last year which says the sides of the phone will have intuitive controls. â€” Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 8, 2017 \nThe HTC Ocean concept phone sizzle reel video below was posted by HTC Source on YouTube with the following disclaimer: \"This video of the HTC Ocean does not feature an upcoming HTC device. The 'sizzle reel' created by Danelle Vermeulen merely shows how one might create a short video to show off the main features of a new device.\" \nThis surfaced concept video created by a visual and motion designer shows the HTC Ocean with a Sense Touch user interface, and no physical controls. It relies on gestures, touch, and voice: you'll find no buttons here. \nThe HTC Ocean looks a lot like the HTC 10, with a full metal unibody, and we can expect waterproofing for this device. \nFor the display, there may be several sizes since there are three codenames floating around for the HTC Ocean: Ocean Master, Ocean Note, and Ocean Smart. The HTC 10 had a 5.2-inch display, with 1,440 x 2,560 pixel resolution, which we may see again with the Ocean. There is no word yet on whether or not HTC will opt for an AMOLED display. HTC 11 camera \nIn the concept video above, the HTC 11 features a comeback of the dual rear camera with LED flash. HTC tried out a dual camera setup with the HTC One M8 's Duo Camera that had a 4 MP rear camera with a sensor just above it, but that was lackluster even when it was released way back in March 2014. The 2016 Huawei P9 featured two 12 MP Leica rear cameras and an 8 MP selfie camera in the front and is one of the best we've ever tested. If the HTC 11 will have a dual camera, we hope it will have similar specs to the Huawei P9. Opinion by Brittany McGhee I want the HTC 11 to have a dual rear camera What do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T13:37:39.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
