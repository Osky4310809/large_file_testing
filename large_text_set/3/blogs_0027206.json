A matter of stocks \nWhile the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge was launched earlier, it is far easier to find than the smaller and cheaper Samsung Galaxy S7. \nThe original RRP of the S7 Edge is RM3099 while the S7 is RM2699. The price after the discount would mean that you could get an S7 Edge for RM2599 and RM2199 for the S7. Considering these were last year's flagships, it's not a bad deal at all. \nYou'll need to find the nearest official Samsung store to avail yourself of the deal though. \nIf you're more keen on the Galaxy S8 instead, here's what we know so far about Samsung's most exciting phone for the moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:44:24.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
