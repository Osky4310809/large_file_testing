Steph and Dom Parker Date: 16.02.2017 Last updated: 16.02.2017 at 12.24 Category: BBC One ; Entertainment ; Casting More celebrity performers are announced today to step up to the mic and bust some moves for Let’s Sing and Dance for Comic Relief. They are Boys Allowed, Stars of The Chase, TV Presenter and Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson, James and Ola Jordan and Steph and Dom Parker from Gogglebox. \nLet’s Dance For Comic Relief is back for Red Nose Day 2017, now bigger and better than ever before as it has been supersized into Let’s Sing And Dance For Comic Relief. BBC One and BBC Entertainment present more celebrities donning more fantastic outfits and learning more iconic dance routines for Comic Relief, but this time the brave celebrities will be facing double the challenge – dancing and singing! Boys Allowed \nBoys Allowed featuring Gareth Gates, Duncan James, Jon Lee, Ritchie Neville and Ben Ofoedu will perform the single Biology by one of the UK’s most successful female pop groups, Girls Aloud. \nGareth Gates says, “I’m so excited to being involved with Comic Relief again. In 2003 I had the honour of performing the official single Spirit In The Sky and they also put me in a bath of baked beans! This time I’m dressing up as a woman! It’s going to be a fantastic performance, I can’t wait to get those high heels on and raise loads of money for such a fantastic cause! You have to tune in!” \nJon Lee says, “I’m so excited to be working with these guys on this performance, it’s going to be lots of fun and it's all for a great cause. Girls Aloud also happen to be one of my favourite groups too so bring on the heels….” \nDuncan James says, “I’m so excited to be taking part in Let’s Sing And Dance For Comic Relief! It’s such a great cause and looking forward to wearing heels again, which I haven’t done since my injury. It should be like riding a bike….I hope.” \nRitchie Neville says, “I'm slightly concerned about quite how much I'm looking forward to this to be honest. Not that dancing in heels won't be a challenge as my name isn't Rachel on weekends regardless of what you might have heard. But with it being for such a great cause it's a win win. Look out Cheryl and Kimberly and co, Boys Allowed are coming for you!” \nBen Ofoedu said, “So looking forward to taking part in Lets Sing And Dance For Comic Relief, I always wanted to channel my inner Ru Paul and now I have the perfect excuse! Oh maybe that's a little too much information! Haha!” The Chasers \nThe Chasers from ITV’s The Chase featuring Anne Hegerty, Jenny Ryan, Mark Labbett and Shaun Wallace are performing a musical medley from the classic Wizard Of Oz. \nAnne Hegerty says, “I was the Scarecrow in the school play when I was nine years old - with future Birds Of A Feather star Peter Polycarpou as the Cowardly Lion! - so it'll be great fun revisiting the role, and of course I have no excuse for forgetting any of the words! I'm not really much of a dancer, so we're hoping to shove Shaun in the way of the cameras and dance behind him.” \nJenny Ryan says, “I’m delighted that we’re taking on one of the most iconic musicals of all time, and it couldn’t be for a better cause than Comic Relief. Viewers are used to seeing us at our sternest and most serious on The Chase, so it might be a bit of a shock when we let our hair down. We might even smile! \n\"Playing Dorothy is every little girl’s dream, and I hope this means I finally get over the trauma of being passed over for the role when I was eight. I never forgave Mrs Lomax, who made me play tambourine instead. I lost out again aged 15, but I channelled my rage into a very vicious performance as the Wicked Witch. Finally, those precious ruby slippers will be mine!” \nMark Labbett says, “Where else can a tone deaf 27 stone man with two left feet get to sing and dance in front of the nation? We are all looking forward to going somewhere over the rainbow and being friends of Dorothy for the evening and to be involved in such a wonderful cause.” \nShaun Wallace says, “I am really exciting and looking forward to playing the Tin Man for this wonderful and worthwhile charity”. Matt Edmondson \nTV Presenter and Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson will perform Superbass by the American rapper and singing superstar, Nicki Minaj. \nMatt says, “When I first got the call from Comic Relief asking me to reveal my superb ass to the nation, I was flattered and also thought \"it’s about time!” It was only later that I learned they’d actually meant Superbass and they wanted me to impersonate Nicki Minaj. \n\"I can’t sing, and I can’t dance, so doing Let’s Sing And Dance For Comic Relief is purely a chance for me to get a photo for my Facebook profile with Mel and Sue.” James and Ola Jordan \nProfessional Dancers James and Ola Jordan will perform All About That Bass by pop singing sensation, Meghan Trainor. \nJames and Ola Jordan said, “It’s an honour to be part of BBC's Let's Sing And Dance For Comic Relief. It's brilliant to think that our ropey singing voices can actually be used to help raise funds for such a good cause!” Steph and Dom Parker \nSteph and Dom Parker from Channel 4’s Gogglebox will perform Dead Ringer For Love by the legendary Meatloaf and Cher. \nSteph and Dom said, “We are so thrilled to be part of Let’s Sing And Dance For Comic Relief this year, it’s such a great charity. We feel privileged to have been asked and to be performing such an iconic number. We are looking forward to releasing our first album.” \nThe celebrities will take to the stage to perform in front of a star-studded panel of judges. A different panel of guest stars and comedy royalty will join each week including Jo Brand, Jason Manford, Paul O’Grady, Frank Skinner, Jennifer Saunders and Claudia Winkleman. \nThe celebrity performers will face three live heats before a live grand finale. A combination of the viewers at home and the judging panel will decide who makes it through to the final, with the audience crowning the eventual winner, all in aid of Comic Relief. \nThe all new Let’s Sing And Dance For Comic Relief will be hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins marking their return to BBC One. They will bring their own formidable and comic double act to the show with access all areas to the celebrities backstage. As well the performances in the studio, the show will even hit the streets of Britain to enlist the great British public in some of the biggest dance-offs ever. And with some surprise special guests in store, Saturday nights will be jam-packed of performances from some of the nation’s favourite faces. \nLet’s Sing And Dance For Comic Relief is a four-part series and will start next month on Saturday nights on BBC One. More celebrities and judges taking part will be announced in due course. \nRed Nose Day is back on Friday 24 March 2017, and it’s all about your power to make the world a better place, simply by having a great time.
