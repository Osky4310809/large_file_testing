This rumor comes just after Los Angeles placed the franchise tag on him. \nJohnson would make $16.7 million with the Rams next season, potentially making him one of the highest paid defensive backs in the NFL. The #Rams are in discussions with several teams about potentially trading franchised CB Trumaine Johnson, per teams involved. Big domino. \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 7, 2017 \nHere’s what Rapoport said about Johnson and the Rams ( via NFL.com ): \n“So much of what the Rams are doing is about building and they would be able to get a significant draft-pick haul for one of the top corners in the game. Right now they are weighing their options, trying to see what is out there for Trumaine Johnson and for the Rams.” \nVincent Bonsignore reports that just because the Rams are open to trading Johnson, however, doesn’t mean a trade is imminent. \nThe Rams have until July 15, 2017 to agree to a multi-year deal with their franchise cornerback.
