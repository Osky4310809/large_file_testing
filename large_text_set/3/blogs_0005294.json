How Brexit affected Britain's favourite foods from Weetabix to Marmite How Brexit affected Britain's favourite foods from Weetabix to Marmite 1/8 Weetabix \nChief executive of Weetabix Giles Turrell has warned that the price of one of the nation’s favourite breakfast are likely to go up this year by low-single digits in percentage terms. Reuters 2/8 Nescafé \nThe cost of a 100g jar of Nescafé Original at Sainsbury’s has gone up 40p from £2.75 to £3.15 – a 14 per cent rise—since the Brexit vote. PA 3/8 Freddo \nWhen contacted by The Independent this month, a Mondelez spokesperson declined to discuss specific brands but confirmed that there would be \"selective\" price increases across its range despite the American multi-national confectionery giant reporting profits of $548m (£450m) in its last three-month financial period. Mondelez, which bought Cadbury in 2010, said rising commodity costs combined with the slump in the value of the pound had made its products more expensive to make. Cadbury 4/8 Mr Kipling cakes \nPremier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling and Bisto gravy, said that it was considering price rises on a case-by-case basis Reuters 5/8 Walkers Crisps \nWalkers, owned by US giant PepsiCo, said \"the weakened value of the pound\" is affecting the import cost of some of its materials. A Walkers spokesman told the Press Association that a 32g standard bag was set to increase from 50p to 55p, and the larger grab bag from 75p to 80p. Getty 6/8 Marmite \nTesco removed Marmite and other Unilever household brand from its website last October, after the manufacturer tried to raise its prices by about 10 per cent owing to sterling’s slump. Tesco and Unilever resolved their argument, but the price of Marmite has increased in UK supermarkets with the grocer reporting a 250g jar of Marmite will now cost Morrisons’ customers £2.64 - an increase of 12.5 per cent. Rex 7/8 Toblerone \nToblerone came under fire in November after it increased the space between the distinctive triangles of its bars. Mondelez International, the company which makes the product, said the change was made due to price rises in recent months. Pixabay 8/8 Maltesers \nMaltesers, billed as the “lighter way to enjoy chocolate”, have also shrunk in size. Mars, which owns the brand, has reduced its pouch weight by 15 per cent. Mars said rising costs mean it had to make the unenviable decision between increasing its prices or reducing the weight of its Malteser packs. iStockphoto \nThe OECD revised up its 2017 growth forecast for the UK due to a less severe impact from Brexit than it previously anticipated, in a report on Tuesday. \nBut the 2018 forecast for UK growth of 1 per cent is lower than the rest of the G7, excluding Japan and Italy, with Brexit thought to be a key factor. \nThe meagre 2018 rise is also the weakest performance from the UK since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009, with the report stating: “UK growth is expected to ease further as rising inflation weighs on real incomes and consumption, and business investment weakens amidst uncertainty about the United Kingdom’s future trading relations with its partners.” \nBrexit also gave the Prime Minister a headache on Tuesday after peers approved a plan to give Parliament the final say over Brexit. \nLords voted by a large majority for the proposal forcing Ms May to seek Parliament’s backing for any withdrawal deal she agrees with the EU, and also if she decides to see through her threat of pulling Britain out of the EU with no deal at all. \nBrexit Secretary David Davis vowed to overturn the changes to the Government’s Bill to trigger Article 50 when it returns to the House of Commons.
