As far as we can tell, there wasn’t a single scratch visible on the device.\nSee also: LG G6 pricing and availability: what we know so far (Update: available in Korea on March 10) 2 days ago This is great news for those of you who are interested in getting the LG G6. You now know that the device doesn’t scratch easily, mainly thanks to Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 that covers the back part of the phone. We still don’t suggest that you carry it in your pocket along with you keys or anything like that, but in case something like this does happen, you shouldn’t worry too much about it.\nThe LG G6 looks like a very promising device and is completely different from its predecessor, the G5 . It features a 5.7-inch Quad HD screen, the Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4 GB of RAM and a two 13 MP cameras on the back.
