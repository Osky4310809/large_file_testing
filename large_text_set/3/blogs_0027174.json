Speaking at an Axios event in Washington, D.C., he said the plan would include both personal and corporate tax reform. \nRELATED: How Trump the dealmaker blew it on health care \nNew details and specifics on the plan have been vague since Trump took office, but he has said he hopes to cut the corporate tax rate from 40 percent to 15 or 20 percent. \"It has to go down,\" Trump told FOX's Tucker Carlson last week. \n\"First of all, it's going to go way down for the middle class,\" the president said. \"It's going to go way down for business. I'm going to try and get the 15 percent level if we can for the business. I think we'll probably be a little bit higher than that, but we're going to try and get the 15 percent level.\" \nOn personal rates, Trump has promised to simplify the tax code, decreasing the number of tax brackets from seven to three: 12, 25, and 33 percent. On this, Trump's plan falls in line with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who acknowledged Friday that the Republican loss on healthcare makes tax reform more difficult but still doable. \nSome, like former conservative radio host Charlie Sykes, see the White House heading into its next legislative hobbled by a foiled gamble on healthcare. Sykes told NBC News Friday the healthcare loss \"casts real doubt on the entire domestic agenda and their ability to get things done.\" \nAs if he were anticipating the naysayers, Spicer put distance between the healthcare issue at hand and the rest of Trump's agenda during his press briefing. \"I don't think you tie any of these together,\" he said, noting a \"huge appetite for tax reform.\" \nBeyond tax reform, Trump has signaled he wants to pursue a trillion dollar infrastructure plan and renegotiate trade deals, like NAFTA. \nDemocrats have signaled a willingness to work with Trump on infrastructure bill, although some Republicans aren't enthusiastic about a massive spending plan. \nAnd knowing who to work with in the future is one of the key takeaways from a White House chastened by the broken promise of health care reform but still hoping to enact a robust agenda. Speaking with NBC Friday evening, Spicer said the administration learned who they could work with going forward. \n\"Some people you can take at their word,\" he said.
