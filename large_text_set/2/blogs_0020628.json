And right now, that’s ACV (or Apple Cider Vinegar) , which boasts literally one hundred million amazing uses, is cheap as hell, and it’s easy to use . Plus, natural products (such as the aforementioned) are crazy beneficial. The most obvious reason? They’re not loaded with chemicals. Two, a lot of natural products can be found right in your pantry. And three, there’s something really fun and satisfying about DIY-ing your own beauty and health-care needs. \nBragg’s Apple Cider Vinegar is usually super cheap in-store or online, and it can be found pretty much everyone. A no-name will probably do, too, but Bragg’s is raw, organic, and unfiltered — and it is bottled with something called “the mother” (we know — weird) that contains live cultures. So, just FYI that “clear and pasteurized vinegars typically do not contain the mother culture and don’t carry the same benefits.” \nMy hubs was under the weather last week and had a cold/sore throat combo. I made him a little concoction that he drank throughout the day to help boost his immune system. ⠀ ⠀ Here's what was on tap: 1️⃣1/2 lemon 2️⃣1/2 inch of ginger grated 3️⃣1/2 inch of tumeric grated+a sprinkle of black pepper so your body absorbs the tumeric 4️⃣1 tsp. Raw honey 5️⃣1/8-1/4 tsp. of cayenne 6️⃣1 Tbls. of apple cider vinegar ⠀ I added the ingredients to a boiling cup of water. You can omit the cayenne or tumeric if you can't stomach the taste or heat from the cayenne. My hubs doesn't like the taste of tumeric so I didn't include that but I did end up adding in cayenne! He said it really helped to soothe his throat and loosen stuff up! All of these ingredients are power houses for kicking sickness to the curb! ⠀ Do you use a DIY remedy when you're sick? \nA post shared by Suzi (@gurlgonegreen) on Feb 19, 2017 at 7:09pm PST \nBut wait — apple cider vinegar smells funky and it doesn’t taste particularly great (at all) and it’s under $3, so what’s the fuss? We’ll tell you.\nOh, and just a reminder: We’re not doctors, so definitely talk to yours before introducing ACV into your lifestyle.\n1. It can clean out your system. So, ACV can be used as a kickstart to your day — which means you’ll be paying regular visits to the gal’s room (we won’t go into details, ok?) to clean out your pipes. Mix that stuff up with a little bit of cayenne pepper, lemon, and honey — and you’ll be good to go. \n2. It can help you stave off cravings. According to studies , good ol’ ACV has been shown to have a “satiating effect, antihyperlipidemic and hypoglycemic effects, and seems prevent the atherogenic risk.” And some people swear it keeps the extra pounds off. Yours truly drinks a bit of ACV in the morning (with seltzer and lime) and swears it staves off unnecessary cravings. You are already beautiful, but if you went a little too heavy on the chocolates or late-night pizzas, we can’t say we haven’t been there.\n\n3. It can give you dose of much-needed energy. Let’s be honest — coffee is ah-mazing, but it has its downsides. It’s filled with milk (which, you know, can be the source of bloatation and acne issues), you probably shouldn’t drink it ALL DAY, and we load it up with sugar. Why not swap one of those cups for a quick zap of ACV? It’s been shown to keep you going when you’re running out of energy. (Just sip it with a straw so you don’t rip the enamel off your teeth). Honestly, we swear by it.\n4. Vitamins! Minerals! Healthy Stuff! ACV is a like the poor man’s version of a green juice. OK — maybe not exactly , but it’s got a lot going for it, like pectin; pantothenic acid; biotin; folic acid; niacin; vitamin C; vitamins B1, B2 and B6; and pantothenic acid. It’s also got potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, sodium, and phosphorous. Are you kidding me? Yes, please.\n5. It can make your hair oh-so-shiny. We’re big suckers for gorgeous hair that doesn’t come at a steep price tag. This is where where ACV comes in. It closes the hair’s cuticle and keeps it luscious and strong. Just use one part ACV and one part water. That’s literally it. Here’s a hair rinse tutorial we love:\n6. Tone your skin on the cheap. Toners are sort of weird — aren’t they? They’re sort of like water, and they can be super expensive. The jury’s still out on whether or not we even need a toner. But when ACV is all-natural, super cheap, and promises to do just as good a job toning your skin (and eliminating acne), why not give it go?\n7. Tummy ache relief. Ate way, way too many cheese cubes at that party? Us, too. Feeling a little bit of heart burn? Yep. We feel you. ACV has been shown to relieve digestive issues, so keep some on hand when you need natural relief. \nYes, ACV is just that good .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:13:50.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
