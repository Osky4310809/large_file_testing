Is that first part corrupt? Sure, it’s corrupt and bullshit. But that’s what politics is. Trump’s not the first guy to charge a ton of money to give people access and he won’t be the last. \n\nBut, I don’t know, maybe limit that access just a smidge? Show those guests the smiling and handshaking part of politics and handle the whole “North Korea just fired a missile at you” stuff behind closed doors rather than in a crowded dining hall in between courses? If nothing else, it’s just inconvenient. I mean they’ve got aides holding camera phones at some pretty important documents because there wasn’t enough light. That’s outrageous. My dad used to yell at me when I tried to read in a poorly lit room because it was bad for my eyes so why don’t the international leaders act like 8 year old me and get up to read in a better light? \n\nAlso, I don’t really know protocol, but I feel like “outting” the aide who holds the nuclear football isn’t the best idea. Maybe I’m wrong, just feel like those are names you keep at least a little close to the vest and not on your grandfather’s facebook page.
