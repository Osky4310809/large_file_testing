App by far by ApolloCosmic I really enjoy this app for various reasons. The game is has minor difference from the actual card game, such as less cards in the main deck, 4000LP, field being limited to three monster and spell/trap card zones, and starting hand being 4 cards . Other wise this game plays closely to the anime, but follows the same general rules as the card game. The game has voice lines for all character from the English dubbed version of Yu-Gi-Oh! The Original series. The games are short and fast and very fun to play, and includes PvP and a store to buy card packs. There are a couple of down sides to the game though. There are a set number of NPC that you can fight on the map and the wait time for them to respond can take about 20+ minutes, but there are in-app purchased items to respond character at a faster rate. Card packs only contain 3 cards per pack, so make sure to look at the pack list to see if you want any of the cards in the pack before you waste your in game currency, which you can earn fairly easily through missions. I recommend this to those who are fan of the anime, the card game, and those interested in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Series. The best by Mega juni Like I always say first impression is everything and so far this is awesome! Games like this and magic the gathering always had good gameplay and content but lacked the flair and spark that hearthstone has that's why it's dominating the card industry, but this game for the first time made me feel like I was playing right out of the cartoon series, it may have changed some things but the overall yugioh gameplay is intact!!! Just keep bringing more cards , characters and content and this game can revive yugioh once again , theirs just one feedback , please make the life points higher 4000 isn't enough considering monsters attack strength is near 2000 which means two or three hits your finished it doesn't give the other player a chance to fight back should be at least 6000 or 7000 , games usually end in like three or four turns not enough time to even set up a strategy and the slots should at least be four monsters and spell/trap cards on the board three is to small, other than that let's duel!!!! Finally hit the nail on the head! by Gdserr r Konami finally made a Yu Gi Oh app done right. Free to play game that gives you the option to spend money, but doesn't necessitate it nor does it give you an unfair advantage. It also gives you the ability to duel other people in realtime AND allows you to add friends and duel them as well! The game has been changed so you can only have a max of 3 monster and magic cards on the field at a time, default LP are 4000 instead of 8000, and starting hands are 4 instead of 5. However the app still captures the fun of the original card game and the duels are still fun and engaging, albeit shorter. The game also offers timed events, ranked mode, missions, card packs that can be bought with in game currency rather than real money, the ability to customize your profile with card mats and card sleeves, and also a global chat so you can help out people who are new to the game. Good job Konami! Hopefully newer cards and characters are added in the future. I see this game becoming a huge success if you play your cards right, Konami (pun intended)!
