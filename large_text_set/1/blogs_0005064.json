We wouldn’t go so far as to say that the Cavs have a psychological edge over Golden State, but we can say that it doesn’t matter how much talent the Warriors have — Cleveland isn’t going to be scared. Draymond is going to need the mental edge that 3-1 defeat gave him.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T22:21:59.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
