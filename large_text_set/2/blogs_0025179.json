The skater should first introduce himself or herself. After the introduction, the video should show the skater doing jumps, spins, footwork , spirals , moves such as Bauers and spread eagles , and jump combinations . After showing individual elements, the skater can include performances from recent competitions, ice shows, or exhibitions. What to Wear \nIn the video, skaters should wear standard figure skating clothes . Look nice and neat. Don't wear baggy clothes. Hair should be pulled back and be away from the face. Don't forget the makeup. Don't Worry If You Are Not a Jumper \nThe video should show the highest level of jumps a skater can do consistently. If you are an ice dancer or a synchronized figure skater who does not jump, indicate that on your resume. Disney On Ice is interested in skaters from all the skating disciplines and backgrounds. Personal Auditions \nMost of the time, the Disney On Ice audition team can decide if a skater is qualified for the show based on their resume, photo, and video. If a personal audition is needed, an audition will be arranged when Disney On Ice comes near a skater's hometown. It is recommended that an applicant send in a portfolio six weeks before one of the Disney On Ice touring shows comes to a skater's area. That way, the there would be enough to time make in person audition arrangements. Information for Parents \nParents of figure skaters in Disney On Ice should know that their children will be traveling in a highly structured and supervised environment. Since the show's cast members represent Disney, it is expected that all skaters maintain a family like and wholesome image on and off the ice. Make Friends For Life \nBeing in a company like Disney On Ice is really like being in a big family since skaters are together so much and are away from home for so long. Those who have toured with Disney On Ice have made lifelong friends. Traveling and Skating Is an Education In Itself \nFigure skaters that are considering educational options before, during, or after the college years should consider that touring Disney On Ice is an educational opportunity and may be a chance of a lifetime. Most young people don't have a talent like figure skating that can open doors like the door Disney On Ice has to offer. \nThere is only a certain amount of years when a skater is at the age and in the physical and mental condition to skate in a professional ice show. Skaters and their parents should take in account that the \"window of opportunity\" to skate in Disney On Ice will not come again. After a year or more of touring, an individual may be ready for college and be better prepared for life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:32:10.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
