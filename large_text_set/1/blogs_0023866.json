Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 Some observers said Trump's orders de-emphasized the number of travelers affected by the hasty implementation of the travel ban, stranding many in transit and blocking some from pre-scheduled flights.\nThe president also knocked Sen. Chuck Schumer, who teared up during a press conference Sunday while dubbing the executive order \"mean-spirited\" and \"un-American.\"\nprotesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 Trump has faced enormous bipartisan backlash over the implementation of the order, which was reportedly hastily executed by top staff members, including chief White House strategist Steve Bannon.\nWhile many Democrats and civil-liberties advocates decried the order as unconstitutional, many Senate Republicans also criticized the rollout of the order, which left top government officials out of the loop and confused customs and border agents, causing hours-long detentions and uncertainty.\n\"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security,\" Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham wrote in a joint statement on Sunday.\nFor their part, Trump and his top White House brass have publicly dismissed critics .\nAppearing on \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday, chief of staff Reince Priebus suggested that the order may expand at some point to include other countries that the administration fears harbor potential terrorists.\n\"Perhaps some of these people should be detained further. And if they're folks that shouldn't be in this country they're going to be detained,\" Priebus told NBC . \"So apologies for nothing here.\"\nSEE ALSO: 'This is an emergency': Left-leaning sites grapple with Trump's defiant attempts to undercut the media NOW WATCH: Mexican architects visualized Trump's proposed $25 billion wall to show how unrealistic it would be Loading video...
