EU 'to take UK to The Hague' if it tries to avoid Brexit divorce bill \n“Would you make sure that they do understand that we’ve been net contributors for many decades to the tune of what is now running at about nine or ten billion [pounds] a year [and] that our accumulated liabilities are offset by the extent to which we’ve made these massive contributions?”, Sir Bill told David James, a Brexit Minister, during a meeting of the European Scrutiny Select Committee. \nHe added: “Perhaps also to bear in mind that back in 1953 there was a thing called the London Debt Agreement, where Germany - for all its malfeasance during the Second World War and its unprovoked aggression - found that in 1953, in circumstances which were quite remarkable, that we remitted one half of all German debt. \n“Therefore if you compare that situation with what it is now and given Germany's extremely dominant role in the EU at the moment it might be worth tactfully - not one of my strongest points - but tactfully reminding people that there is a realistic position here that we really don't owe anything to the EU whether it's legal or political.” \nIn response, Mr Jones said: “I'm not entirely sure how tactful one can be when one is mentioning the London Debt Agreement. But nevertheless, clearly there are a whole range of issues.” \nThe London Debt Agreement provided West Germany with relief on its post-war debts and tied repayments to the state of the country’s economy, in a bid to help it re-integrate with the West.
