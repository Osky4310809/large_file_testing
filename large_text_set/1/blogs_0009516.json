Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJay Rodriguez is convinced his Southampton side will emerge stronger after yet more upheaval with skipper Jose Fonte poised to quit the club this month. \nPortuguese central defender Fonte is a target for Everton , with Manchester United also interested. \nBut Rodriguez recalled the summer of 2014, during which boss Mauricio Pochettino left for Spurs and five first-team players - Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers - were sold. \nPochettino’s successor Ronald Koeman, who himself left Saints last summer to manage Everton, famously reacted to the exodus by tweeting a picture of a deserted training pitch. \nRodriguez said: “It was a strange time. A lot of players left. The manager left. New boss Koeman tried to make light of Southampton's summer 2014 departures \n\"It was a strange time for me and a lot of the players. \n“It happens in football – so many players came in and out of team and the main thing was everyone had to stick to the philosophy of ‘We need to improve on last year’. \n“You don’t think about too much else. It’s about what we do on the training ground. That’s what we did and we didn’t look back.” \nRodriguez believes Southmpton can still beat Jurgen Klopp’s rampant Liverpool in their EFL Cup semi-final, despite being without captain Fonte for Wednesday night's first leg at St Mary's. \nHe added: “Of course we can. The squad we have is very strong. Southampton and Liverpool drew 0-0 in the Premier League at St Mary's in November (Photo: AFP/Getty) \n“The players we have got mean we have great strength in depth. We will go out there and try to win. We want to put our game on Liverpool \n“I think in football things change very quickly. I think lads aren’t naive to think it doesn’t. \n\"You have to stay focused and realise what you need to do to move forward. It comes from individuals but also collectively. \n\"If we work hard, we’ll get the right outcomes.” poll loading Who will reach the EFL Cup final? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:45:13.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
