She’s the new brand ambassador for OPPO Camera Phone and the ad for it looks spectacular. Filmmaker Vinil Mathew , whose Hasee Toh Phasee we love, has directed this ad and DP looks like a million bucks in it. We got our hands on some behind the scenes footage of the ad shoot. \nAs a selfie lover myself, I’m really digging this phone because the OPPO F3 Plus phone comes with dual selfie cameras! You know what that means, right? I can get some epic 16 megapixel selfies anytime, anywhere. And to top it all, there’s a special 120-degree wide-angle lens for group selfies! What more can we ask for? <3 Check it out! \nFor information, follow OPPO on Twitter , Instagram and Facebook . \nThis post is in partnership with OPPO. 11", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:51:23.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
