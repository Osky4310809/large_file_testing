Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the International Refugee Assistance Project (formerly Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project) at the Urban Justice Center. \nThe ACLU is massively funded by Soros’s Open Society Foundations, including with a $50 million grant in 2014. \nThe National Immigration Law Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. \nThe Urban Justice Center is also the recipient of an Open Society grant. \nTaryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project, which is listed on the Trump lawsuit, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations. \nGroups at the protests could also be traced to Soros. \nAccording to PJ Media, “Make the Road” is also a far left group funded by Soros. \nIt’s one thing to disagree on policy and legitimately protest. \nIt’s another to continually fund people and groups who riot and/or cause chaos, as Soros does.
