Currently, LEGO Batman ‘s Chris McKay is in negotiations to take on the role of director with The Accountant ‘s Bill Dubuque penning the script.\nIf you recall, Robin is briefly alluded to in Batman v Superman through a Joker-vandalized suit. Zack Snyder, without revealing whether this Robin was Grayson or a different Robin, revealed that this is supposed to suggest that Robin is dead and Batman is still mourning the loss . As a result, how McKay might fit his Nightwing story into the DC Extended Universe is uncertain—though I think most of us aren’t opposed to rewriting some of Snyder’s work.\nWhile we’ve definitely been a bit more jaded about DC Movies, McKay’s LEGO Batman demonstrated a strong understanding of the caped crusader alongside a lighthearted and endearing take on the boy wonder. The tone of a Nightwing movie would obviously be wildly different, but I’m hopeful. McKay is not only a huge Batman fan, but he also spoke candidly with us at an NYC screening about a need for diversity. As for who would play Nightwing, I can think of a few people who’d crush in it the role .\nWhat do you think about a potential Nightwing movie?\n(via The Hollywood Reporter , Image via DC comics)\nWant more stories like this?
