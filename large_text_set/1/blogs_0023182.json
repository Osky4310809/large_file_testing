Now, a new decree makes it illegal to sell unlimited amounts of drinks with sugar or sweetener at a fixed price or for free. \nPublished in the government's Journal Officiel website on Thursday and in force since Friday, the ban applies to all soft drinks or soda \"fountains\" in areas open to the public, including restaurants, fast food-chains, schools and holiday camps. \nOut of bounds are unlimited \"flavoured fizzy and non-fizzy drinks, concentrated drinks like fruit syrups, drinks based on water, milk, cereal, vegetables or fruit\", but also \"sports and energy drinks, fruit nectar, vegetable nectar and similar products\". \nHome improvement chain IKEA had already removed drink fountains from its 33 centres around France, but other vendors, including French fast food chain Quick, waited until the day itself t o change their drink fountain set-up. \nFive Guys, a newcomer in France, opted to add microchips to cups so when customers try and get a refill from its fountains, they automatically switch off. \nParliament approved the ban in April 2015 and enshrined it in a health law in January 2016 as part of drive to reduce obesity. French take obesity seriously Credit: Clara Molden/PA \nA recent health study suggested that half of French adults are now overweight. However; only 15 are technically obese. \nAccording to the World Health Organisation, both conditions are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A person with a body mass index (weight divided by the square of his or her height) of 30 or more is generally considered obese. A person with a BMI equal to or more than 25 is considered overweight. \nFrance's Health Minister Marisol Touraine has championed the ban on unlimited refills, telling MPs two years ago: \"This habit is common in other countries and it is increasingly taking hold in France. I understand it can be attractive for young people who are offered unlimited sugary drinks, which contain an excessive amount of sugar or sweeteners.\" \nFrance started cracking down on the causes of obesity in 2004, when it limited school vending-machines to selling fruit and water. \nIn 2011 the government banned ketchup from school cafeterias and only allowed chips on the menu once a week. \"France must be an example to the world in the quality of its food, starting with its children,\" said the then agriculture and food minister Bruno Le Maire. A soda drink tax ensued. \nIt appears the measures are working, as the French consume fewer soft drinks per person than any other country in Western Europe bar Portugal, recent research suggested. \nThe French drank 65.5 litres per capita of sweet drinks in 2015 compared to 106.6 litres in Britain, according to figures cited by Le Figaro. \nThe Americans consume more than twice as many soft drinks as the French, drinking 155 litres per capita in 2014, according to NPD group findings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T14:26:21.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
