By Roger Robinson Tuesday, March 21, 2017, 5:15 pm Doris Brown clocks an indoor mile in 4:50.1 in 1968 (left). At home near Seattle, she still enjoys running outdoors on trails. Bettmann/Getty Images; Linda Ellingsen \nOne of America’s greatest distance running talents had one major flaw: She was too fast for her time. \nUp until 1967, the longest race for women that was contested in international competition was the Olympic 800 meters. That changed 50 years ago, on March 18, 1967, when the International Cross-Country Union added a 2.5-mile women’s championship.

She won by 37 seconds, an estimated 200 yards. With only one other American there, Patricia Cole, there was no team to score for. \nThe new championship—and its unknown American star—had a mixed reception.

She cherished her tiny medal (even though the men’s trophy was huge), but her country didn’t see fit to fund her travel. “We thought after my win, the USA surely would send a team the next year, and indeed, we won in 1968—but again it was our friends and neighbors who helped financially, not our federation.” \nHeritage was certainly training as the best of the men were. She’s the first woman known to have run 100 miles a week. “When I read that Jim Ryun was running twice a day, I tried it, and immediately my times improved, even at sprints,” Heritage said. \nBut across the ocean people better recognized Heritage’s accomplishments than they did at home. Today in 1971, Doris Brown Heritage breaks the 2 day fresh US mile record running 4:41.3 pic.twitter.com/sRzQ3SFgQ2 \n— Joseph Fuller (@JustRunFuller) June 6, 2016 \nOne of those was the eminent English writer and statistician Mel Watman. “Possibly no woman in history has trained so intensively as this 5-foot, 4-inch Washingtonian of Norwegian descent,” Watman wrote in Athletics Weekly in 1967. \nHe is is still full of praise. \n“Doris with her arduous training regime is one of the most significant figures in the evolution of women’s running,” Watman said this month from London. \nBorn in 1942, Heritage has always lived in Washington. She began as a track runner, because there was no other kind of running for women. At Seattle Pacific University she was coached by Ken Foreman and began the training that made her so significant. \n“In the summer of 1966, she ran three times most days: five miles in the morning, speed work in the afternoon, and up to 10 miles in the evening,” Watman said. “Her weekly total was between 70 and 100 miles.” \nThat dedication brought its first reward when she set the world indoor record for the mile, 4:52, in 1966. \nAt last, the International Cross-Country race offered an opportunity for her to compete at a longer distance. Heritage went on to win the championship five times in total. She picked up another world track record, 9:26.9 for 3,000 meters, in 1971. \nShe was twice a U.S. Olympian in the 800 meters, in 1968 and 1972, and her PR was 2:01.9, but it was her high-paced endurance that made her unique. She would have been a phenomenon at 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters—had those events existed for women. \nShe had switched to coaching before she ran her first marathon, at age 33, in Vancouver in 1976. Astonishing herself and the world, she won in 2:37:45. The same year, she finished second to Miki Gorman at New York City in 2:53:03, despite taking a red-eye flight to get to the race. \nBut her peak years fell just too early for the marathon boom. \nThat’s done nothing to dampen her lasting love of her sport. Heritage coached the U.S. Olympic team in 1984 and served on the IAAF cross-country committee.

I will always feel some ownership, like it’s part of my soul.” \nShe still loves the wooded trails, although arthritis slows her. Her dog, which she named Deena Kastor, logs the big miles. \n“Deena has a bit of a fartlek mentality, but I’m faithful with my exercise regimen, and like all runners, always planning to get faster and do more,” she said. \nAs the dog’s name suggests, Heritage is a fan as well as a legend. \n“I admire Deena Kastor, and before her, Lynn Jennings. Shalane [Flanagan], and her mother Cheryl Bridges [now Treworgy] was on the USA team with me in 1968,” Heritage said. “And of course Meb [Keflezighi], and I can’t wait to see what Molly Huddle, Jenny Simpson, and Emma Coburn might do at longer distances.” \nNo one today could emulate Heritage’s five world titles, or outdo her in the commitment that impelled her to win them. \nAnd in 2017, at the IAAF World Cross-Country Championships on March 26 in Kampala, Uganda, men and women will race the same distance for the first time in history: 10K. \nThat journey to equality has taken 50 years, and it started with Doris Brown Heritage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:12:17.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
