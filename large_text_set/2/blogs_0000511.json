But MIT’s system aims to help make it easier to measure and understand situations. \nSubjects wore a Samsung Simband, which captures high-resolution physiological waveforms to measure movement, heart rate, blood pressure, blood flow, and skin temperature. It also picks up audio data and text transcripts to analyze the speaker’s tone, pitch, energy, and vocabulary. \nAfter collecting more than 30 conversations, scientists trained two algorithms: one to classify the overall nature of a conversation as happy or sad, the other to classify each five-second block of a conversation as positive, negative, or neutral. \n“It’s quite remarkable that a machine could approximate how we humans perceive these interactions, without significant input from us as researchers,” Al Hanai said. \nThe machine determined—with 83 percent accuracy—that cues such as long pauses, monotonous vocal tones, and fidgeting are associated with sadder stories, while energetic, varied speech patterns typically identify happier tales. \nIn the future, similar systems could serve as “social coaches” for people with anxiety or Asperger’s. But MIT’s algorithm isn’t yet ready for prime time, according to Al Hanai. \n“Our next step is to improve the algorithm’s emotional granularity so that it is more accurate at calling our boring, tense, and exciting moments, rather than just labeling interactions as ‘positive’ or ‘negative,'” she said. “Developing technology that can take the pulse of human emotions has the potential to dramatically improve how we communicate with each other.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:16:55.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
