(Photo: Getty) More An Egyptian woman, Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty, weighs about 1,100 pounds and is believed to be the world’s heaviest woman. The 36-year-old had not left her house in 25 years before a trip to Mumbai, India, for bariatric surgery . Before undergoing the surgery, Abd El Aty can consume only liquids for 25 days in order to lose 110 pounds. “Only after all the diseases related to obesity are brought under control and Eman loses weight will we conduct the surgery,” surgeon Muffazal Lakdawala, a weight loss specialist, told the Daily Mail . Lakdawala hopes that the surgery will help Abd El Aty lose another 330 pounds, which would allow her to sit up and feed herself. Then, over the course of several years, it would bring her weight down to 220 pounds. Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty arrives in Mumbai.

She then suffered a pulmonary stroke that caused paralysis in her right leg and arm, forcing her to drop out of primary school and leaving her bedridden, all of which exacerbated her conditions. She has since faced weight-related conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure, and sleep problems. Abd El Aty lies in a custom bed for transit.

Her sister then tweeted a plea to India’s foreign minister, who approved Abd El Aty’s visa. Her family also issued an online plea to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, asking for medical assistance for Abd El Aty’s flight. A crane lowers Abd El Aty in Mumbai via cargo plane.

But bariatric surgery offers Abd El Aty a chance at a normal life, which she’s been deprived of for over two decades.
