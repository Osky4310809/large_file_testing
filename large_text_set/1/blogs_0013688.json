Trump defeated the heavy favorite Hillary Rodham Clinton. Sadly, so many of the articles were biased towards one of the candidates making their attempt to dissect the shocking results of the election flawed and partisan. For over two months after the startling election results that turned the political world on its head, nobody could effectively communicate why Hillary Clinton lost the election and why heavy underdog Donald Trump won the election after being universally underestimated by nearly everyone in the media. However, one man seems to have a firm grasp the series of events that led to the astonishing election of Donald J. Trump as the next President of the United States, and that man is Norm MacDonald. Yes, the same Norm MacDonald that is a comedian and was referred to as Turd Ferguson on Saturday Night Live back in the day. \nMacDonald, who is Canadian, puts forth an insightful look into the mistakes by the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party, and why we all need to come together for the betterment of the country and to love, even love your enemy. \nSo much panic or \"panic\" or fear or \"fear\" or \"hate\" or \"hate\" or racism or \"racism\".

The country is more divided than it has ever been.\n— Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) January 16, 2017 \nThere are many, many reasons Hillary did not win, but I think the chief problem was that the Democratic party coronated her.\n— Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) January 16, 2017 \nHillary should never have been the nominee. She became the nominee due to the type of Tammany Hall politics the democratic voter could see.\n— Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) January 16, 2017 \nUsing political chits, first-lady status, Obama ties, Michelle Obama-quotes and the grimy olicharchic use of \"super delegates\".\n— Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) January 16, 2017 \nThe country was ready for a change, both Republicans and Democrats.
