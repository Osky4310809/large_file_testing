Jennifer Williamson was traveling with her son Aaron, who has sensory processing disorder, the Daily Mail reported.\nWilliamson said her son was stopped by TSA agents, and detained for more than an hour despite not setting off any metal detectors. She took a video of the pat down, and shared it on Facebook.\nShe wrote:\nWe have been through hell this morning. They detained Aaron for well over an hour at DFW. (And deliberately kept us from our flight... we are now on an alternate) We were treated like dogs because I requested they attempt to screen him in other ways per TSA rules. He has SPD and I didn't want my child given a pat down like this. Let me make something else crystal clear. He set off NO alarms. He physically did not alarm at all during screening, he passed through the detector just fine. He is still several hours later saying 'I don't know what I did. What did I do?' I am livid. Please, share... make this viral like the other children's videos with TSA... I wish I had taped the entire interchange because it was horrifying. We had two DFW police officers that were called and flanking him on each side. Somehow these power tripping TSA agents who are traumatizing children and doing whatever they feel like without any cause, need to be reined in.\nThe post quickly went viral. It was shared more than 80,000 times and viewed more than 4 million times. The two-minute-long video shows Aaron being patted down by a TSA officer, who appears to check the same areas more than once.\nSeveral social media users expressed their outrage with the video.\n\"This screener is a perv or doesn't know what he's doing,\" wrote one commenter. \"There's no reason this should have required multiple strokes of the child's body.\"\n\"That TSA agent was a little over zealous in patting down a little boy,\" wrote another. \"I understand the parent being upset, if that guy touched my kid like that it would not end well.\"\n\"I think he needs to be re-trained. Maybe doing his job but when does common sense kick in?\" wrote another commenter. \"This kid is too young & traveling with parent-doesn't really seem like a high threat to me. He took too long doing it & def went over some areas twice which seems inappropriate & unnecessary.\"\nThe TSA told the Dallas News that the two officers involved in the incident were called in to help reassure Williamson.\n\"The video shows a male TSA officer explaining the procedure to the passenger, who fully cooperates,\" the agency explained. \"Afterward, the TSA officer was instructed by his supervisor, who was observing, to complete the final step of the screening process.\"\nThe agency also said Williamson and her family were detained for 35 minutes, not more than an hour like the mother claimed.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:01:10.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
