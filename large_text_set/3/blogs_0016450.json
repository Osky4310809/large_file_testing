(@racheltunnard) March 17, 2017\nGadot has spoken up on various criticisms people have thrown her way since taking on this role, particularly on the size on the size of breasts.\n\"It's just empty talk. I understand that part of what I'm doing means being exposed. And part of being exposed is being under fire,\" she told Israeli website Ynet , translated by SuperHeroHype forum.\n\"When I was younger I would take criticism really hard. But now it mostly amuses me. The true Amazons had one boob so it wouldn't bother them in their archery,\" she said. \"So it's not going to be like real Amazons. We always try to make everyone happy but we can't.\"\nMaybe Wonder Woman has the energy and time to prioritize maintain her pits, and that is her prerogative. But regardless of a little stubble or not, nothing will be stopping her from saving the world on June 2.\nWATCH: Someone has invented a waterproof toupee that looks just like real hair", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JoeCunningham14/status/842208003633881088", "https://twitter.com/GanjaGhost420/status/840813317165858816", "https://twitter.com/mattsontomlin/status/840824184552939520", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/S7KJ5DcWiAJ1IbGWJSe6c3X_jls=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419486%2F64990277-0b59-4f3d-8f96-42644944e4e5.png", "https://t.co/V4nZ07heaj", "https://t.co/MPXMERdi3S", "http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4637607,00.html", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QQeUqjoc0ePROSyeNHAooZXvGOA=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419486%2F64990277-0b59-4f3d-8f96-42644944e4e5.png", "https://twitter.com/martian_munk/status/842894873325899777", "http://people.com/bodies/gal-gadot-responds-to-body-critics-on-role-as-wonder-woman-in-batman-v-superman/", "https://twitter.com/paulidin/status/840798480050278401", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/8a2tDCq8.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/8a2tDCq8.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INLzqh7rZ-U", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/WonderWoman?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/racheltunnard/status/842646119821840384"], "published": "2017-03-20T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:21:10.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
