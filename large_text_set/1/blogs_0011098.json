Swaraj tweeted that she had asked the Indian High Commission in Canada to take up the issue with Amazon, after it was brought to her attention by a Twitter user from India's financial capital of Mumbai. \nSwaraj is a prolific user of the social media website and often responds to tweets directed at her. \nAmazon is making a huge bet on India and has vowed to invest more than $5 billion as it takes on home-grown Flipkart and Snapdeal for a bigger share of the world's fastest growing internet services market. \nIn an event attended by premier Narendra Modi in Washington last year, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said India was the company's fastest growing region. \nÂ© Thomson Reuters 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T06:32:12.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
