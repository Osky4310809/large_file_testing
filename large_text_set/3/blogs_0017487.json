Show me your budget and I will tell you what you value,” and the National Republican Congressional Committee actually thought that was worth repeating as an attack on the Obama-Biden budget back in 2013. \nWell. \nDonald Trump’s budget tells us plenty about what he values—but it tells us even more about what he doesn’t value. \nTrump values military hardware. He values a border wall. He doesn’t value people’s lives—feeding people or keeping them warm, doing medical research to prevent and heal diseases, job training or college preparation for disadvantaged youth. He doesn’t value the environment, or parks, or the arts. Trump’s America, the America he is trying to build with this budget, is ignorant, unskilled, sick, hungry, cruel, and violent . It’s bleak and barren and devoid of joy. \nHere are some of the details. \nThere’s an assault on science and the things we do with science: Trump’s budget slashes funding for medical research , cutting the National Institutes of Health’s budget by 20 percent. A proposed 31 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency's budget would abolish 50 different programs and 3,200 jobs. To say it would weaken environmental protection is something of an understatement. \nThere’s an assault on people’s ability to get ahead in this economy: All those coal country voters who supported Trump would lose out big league, starting with the demise of the Appalachian Regional Commission and moving down the list to other programs that are heavily used in coal country, like … Job training for seniors and disadvantaged youths , which are part of the $2.5 billion in proposed cuts to the Labor Department. Cuts to housing programs, including ones that promote homeownership, would be devastating to black Americans . Education cuts would slash teacher training, college prep for disadvantaged students, and after-school programs … but there’d be plenty of money for privatization schemes that don’t produce results. \nThere’s an assault on the basics of survival for the most vulnerable in our society: Meals on Wheels is on the chopping block. Meals on effing Wheels. Why? Because it’s not “showing any results,” as if people who are not hungry is not a result worth talking about. Same with meals for school kids. Heating assistance for low-income families would be eliminated, because it’s a “lower-impact program” that is “unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes.” Because, again, apparently people who are not cold doesn’t count as a strong performance outcome. \nThere’s an assault on culture: Wave goodbye to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the programming it supports. Apparently coal miners in West Virginia and single moms in Detroit can be expected to pay for more aircraft carriers, but it’s an outrage to think they’d care about public television—even though Americans across all demographics watch PBS. The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities would be gone under Trump’s budget. The national parks would survive, but cuts to clean water programs mean a lot of parks are suddenly going to have stunning views of really polluted bodies of water. Oh, and historic preservation programs are being slashed, so better hurry up and see any parks made interesting by the history they display, because that’s about to go down the drain. \nPriorities, priorities: We may not have Meals on Wheels, but the money for that border wall has to come from somewhere now that Trump has admitted Mexico won’t be paying for it. Trump's golfing schedule is much more important than the hundreds of thousands of meals for seniors that could be paid for with the money it takes to get him to Mar-a-Lago practically every weekend, and Melania’s decision to stay in New York will eat up the National Endowment for the Arts’ entire budget in just five months. This budget would kill people , but at least those are people being killed by someone other than Muslim extremists, so I guess that’s a win in Trump’s book? \nAs Nancy Pelosi said , “ This budget is really a slap in the face of the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:50:29.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
