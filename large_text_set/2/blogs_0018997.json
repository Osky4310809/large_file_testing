You’ll be able to get the device at major retail stores starting tomorrow, February 23, while online sales will kick off a few days later – February 26. The device will set you back Rs. 13,990 and comes in the Black, Gold, or Titanium color option.\nThe mid-ranger sports a 5.3-inch HD display and is powered by the MediaTek MT6750 chipset. It has 2 GB of RAM and only 16 GB of storage, which can thankfully be expanded for an additional 256 GB with a microSD card (fortunately there’s a good deal on right now for just that very thing). You’ll also find a 13 MP primary camera at the back with an f/2.2 aperture along with a fingerprint scanner.\nSee also: LG K8 and LG K10 hands on: mid-range moneymakers January 4, 2017 The K10 comes with a useful SOS feature too. You are able to call the national emergency number — 112 — by simply pressing the power button three times. Other features of the LG K10 include a 2,800 mAh battery, a metal body and dual-SIM support. It runs Android 7.0 Nougat with LG’s custom user interface on top.\nIf you’re interested in getting the LG K10, you can pick one up starting tomorrow. You’ll get a free smart cover with your purchase as well as unlimited audio and video downloads from Hungama for 45 days. Interestingly, LG’s India site lists the phone for Rs. 15,000, so you’re better off waiting for retailer listings to go live.\nBut if for some reason you don’t like the device and would rather opt for a different smartphone, you can check out the recently launched ASUS ZenFone 3s Max , or the Samsung Galaxy On5 Pro and Galaxy On7 Pro , both of which received a price cut about a week ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:26:20.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
