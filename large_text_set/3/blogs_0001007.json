Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA bouncer who strangled his wife with a bra strap after stealing her £20,000 \"wedding dowry\" has had his murder sentence extended after failing in a bid to clear his name. \nAbul Kashem Miah, 39, killed primary school teacher Rukshana Miah, 35, at their former home after he \"lost control\" and snapped in anger in August 2014. \nThe vicious bully, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was convicted of murder in November 2015. \nThe nightclub and bar bouncer said his actions amounted to manslaughter and has now tried to claim he had an unfair trial and he was mentally unwell at the time of police interview, reports Manchester Evening News . Mum-of-two Rukshana Miah was murdered by Abul Kashem Miah Read More Adam Johnson's ex-girlfriend Stacey Flounders arrives at court as disgraced footballer launches appeal bid over child sex conviction \nBut on Friday the Court of Appeal rejected his bid to overturn the conviction, deeming it a \"hopeless\" case from the start. \nLord Justice Simon said: “There was no proper basis for excluding his interview. He never raised an issue as to his mental state at the time. He was assessed by health professionals as fit to be interviewed.” \nMiah was initially given a life sentence but the dismissed appeal means he will have to serve 60 more days inside before seeking parole. \nHis trial at Manchester Crown Court heard how Miah stole his wife's gold wedding dowry — including bangles, necklace and earrings — and made a bogus insurance claim on it before locking it in a safe. \nMum-of-two who 'attacked child killer Rose West in prison' admits: I got sick of it so I cracked her \nThe precious jewellery had been given to Rukshana Miah by his family on her marriage according to Bangladeshi custom. \nWhen the mother-of-two threatened to accuse him of rape unless he returned the jewellery on August 17, 2014, Miah suddenly snapped and strangled his partner. \nHe wrapped the teacher in a duvet and fled the house, jurors were told. \nShe died days later in hospital.
