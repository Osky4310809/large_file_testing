But it did not go into effect before the Trump administration took over. That rule is probably dead. Nevertheless, shareholders may be able to improve clawback policies at two big companies this year: Verizon and Caterpillar. \n  “The whole concept of executive compensation is pay for performance,” said Cornish F. Hitchcock , a lawyer in Washington who is advising the group of Verizon shareholders proposing the policy change at the company. “If executives’ behavior costs the company money or damages its reputation, shouldn’t there be consequences?” The Verizon shareholders agitating for change are a group of 205,000 former telecom employees known as the Association of BellTel Retirees . Since 1997, 10 proposals put forward by the retirees have been voted on by Verizon shareholders; in eight of the measures, the company responded by changing its policies, according to the retirees’ website . \n  This year, the retirees’ organization wants the company to expand its clawback policy; Verizon’s current policy limits pay recoveries to executives who engaged in “willful misconduct” that causes significant financial or reputational harm to the company. Far too narrow, the retirees say. First of all, the term “willful misconduct” is ill defined, Mr. Hitchcock said, and may limit pay recoveries to egregious cases only. In addition, Verizon’s policy should also cover wrongdoing that arose because of negligence or a supervisory failure. Verizon is urging its shareholders to vote against the retirees’ proposal at the annual meeting in early May. James Gerace, a Verizon spokesman, explained why in a phone interview. “Negligence could be really broad and open to interpretation,” he said. “We were trying not to make it so broadly applicable that it was going to paralyze our people in making decisions.” \n  In their proposal, the retirees detailed why Verizon’s current policy is problematic, citing a 2015 regulatory settlement Verizon struck with the Federal Communications Commission. The agency contended that Verizon placed unauthorized third-party charges on customers’ cellular phone bills; the company paid $90 million to settle the matter. \n  Under the policy, it’s unclear whether the company scrutinized the actions of any executives relating to this settlement, the retirees’ proposal said. So they urged Verizon to change its policy so that it must disclose details of any clawbacks to shareholders as well as decisions not to pursue recoveries. \n  Shareholders of Caterpillar, the heavy-equipment maker whose offshore tax practices are under investigation by federal authorities, will vote on clawbacks this year. Tejal Patel, corporate governance director at Change to Win Investment Group, said her group put forward a shareholder proposal on clawbacks for this year’s annual meeting. “If something goes wrong,” she said, “you want executives to be held accountable and know what the company is doing about it.” A Caterpillar spokeswoman confirmed that the proposal would be on the proxy this year. Of course, many individual investors — those who own shares in mutual funds — can’t speak their minds through proxy votes. Their funds vote their shares for them and all too often follow corporate boards’ recommendations to reject shareholder proposals. \n  If you own shares in a mutual fund and feel strongly about these issues, write to the fund’s executives and tell them how you want them to vote your shares. They may not do as you say, but at least they’ll know where you stand. \nTwitter: @gmorgenson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:48:55.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
