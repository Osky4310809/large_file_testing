But we aren’t necessarily in a position where we have to churn a large number of players. We want to get in a steady state.” \nWoodward refused to confirm reports United will return to the United States for their next pre-season tour, but said the tour will be “larger” than last year’s short trip to China. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:22:20.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
