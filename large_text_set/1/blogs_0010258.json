The creators of your beloved iPhone are stepping into the content game, big time. Apparently, Apple is looking to make its own TV shows to rival Netflix . Last year Apple announced Dr. Dre’s show, Vital Signs , but it seems now, they really means business. Their addition adds another layer to the HBO vs. Netflix rivalry — but ultimately means more exciting content for us to watch, so, YAS.\nApple stepping into the TV game has been rumored for ages, but now, it looks like they’ve actually reached out to Hollywood producers to realize their vision. The Wall Street Journal reports that the technology giant plans to offer original video content by the end of 2017. The holidays are the perfect time for binging, so we’re all about this news.\n\nApple doesn’t plan to flood the market with video content, though. Instead, they’re focusing on a few original concepts. Quality, not quantity, seems to be what they’re going for — and with so many great shows out there, that’s definitely a good call.\nThough they’re starting slowly, the company’s new shows are already creating buzz. Apart from Vital Signs , which is scripted there’s also the half-hour, new version of Carpool Karaoke . They’re not exactly Stranger Things, we know . But, people already love Carpool Karaoke , so Apple has a chance at becoming a real contender in the television world.\nCBS Apple hasn’t bought any scripts yet, though, so there’s no world on whether we’ll get more than the first two shows in 2017. Once they get solid on the business model for their shows, though, they may even branch out with original movies.\n\nAs of now, both Apple shows in the works deal heavily with music. The expansion could mean they plan to branch out from that. However, creating video content with a music-driven sensibility could also set Apple’s shows apart. Then, they would really stand out among the likes of Netflix, HBO, and Amazon. Either way, more great TV means that viewers like us get the best part of the deal.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:59:51.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
