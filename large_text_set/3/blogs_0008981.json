Premiums will increase by 15 to 20 percent. And by 2026, 24 million people will not have insurance. And this is how he tries to spin it in his statement: I recognize and appreciate concerns about making sure people have access to coverage. Under Obamacare, we have seen how government-mandated coverage does not equal access to care, and now the law is collapsing. Our plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive, one-size-fits-all coverage. It is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford. When people have more choices, costs go down. \nAnd when people get far less assistance to pay for those choices, you bloviating sociopath, they don't get insurance. They might have \"access\" to it, but if they can't afford to pay for it, they're not going to get the care that comes with it. And they'll die before their time. And theirs will be completely avoidable deaths. \nRepublicans only narrowly control the Senate, and with constituent pressure we can deal TrumpCare a humiliating defeat. Call the Capitol Hill switchboard at (202) 224-3121, ask for your Senators’ office and urge them to reject TrumpCare.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:15:37.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
