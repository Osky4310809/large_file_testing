  \nDavid Hasselhoff is working to bring a 1980s cult classic that made him a star after it first appeared on our television screens 30 years ago. \nHasselhoff formed one of TV's great double acts with Kitt, the talking car in Knight Rider, when he played crime fighter Michael Knight from 1982 to 1986. \nAnd now more than 30 years later the actor, 64, has been pictured shirtless and ­looking ready to roll beside the cult show’s ­classic motor as he filmed a new series. \nWhile the series made the actor, nicknamed The Hoff, a huge star it also made an icon of the 1982 Pontiac Trans-Am used for Kitt – or the Knight Industries Two Thousand. Hasselhoff was seen on set filming scenes for Knight Rider (Photo: Splash News) The Hoff was snapped filming (Photo: Splash News) \nHasselhoff is working with Justin Lin, director of Fast and Furious and Star Trek Beyond, to resurrect the show for NBCUniversal and streaming service Machinima, three decades after it first hit our TV screens. Read More David Hasselhoff uses Baywatch theme tune as ringtone because he's just that awesome, says Ronan Keating \nMachinima chief Chad Gustein said: “Knight Rider is an iconic franchise whose concepts of AI and autonomous vehicles were sci-fi in the 1980s and are now science fact.” \nHasselhoff, who was joined on set by Welsh fiancée Hayley Roberts, 34, seemed delighted to be back in the driving seat as he joked with co-stars. David Hasselhoff (Photo: Splash News) \nAfter the original show ended, Hasselhoff had another huge success with Baywatch in 1989. \nBut it marked the beginning of a difficult period as the star fell into partying and boozing – culminating in a now well known video of him in 2007 collapsed in a drunken heap as he tried to eat a cheeseburger. Read More \nThe footage was shot by daughter Taylor Ann, who was 16 and could be heard off camera pleading repeatedly: “Tell me you’re going to stop.” David Hasselhoff with fiancee Hayley Roberts (Photo: Splash News) \nHasselhoff admitted: “Since Knight Rider, I have never had to worry about my next pay cheque but I did go out and party too much. I did it for years but the partying got to be an obsession and wasn’t about having fun any more. It was about taking me away from being sad.” \nIn recent years, Hasselhoff has cleaned up his act and appeared on Britain’s Got Talent and America’s Got Talent, released more music and made countless cameos. Now, he will crown his comeback by riding with Kitt again. \nBut Knight Rider is not the only 80s hit getting a reboot. A small-screen version of 1987 film Lethal Weapon, starring Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford, is hitting ITV and 1985 secret agent MacGyver is back on Sky1. \nAnd for fans of The Hoff, Baywatch is also coming back. \nSo as film and TV bosses indulge their love of all things 80s, here is our guide to a few more nostalgic treats heading your way. The Lost Boys \nVampire lovers will want to sink their teeth into a TV series of the uber-cool 1987 comedy horror flick The Lost Boys. Kiefer Sutherland, star of 24, and his band of biker blood suckers were undead years before the birth of the Twilight saga. \nThe film, which also starred Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, had the tagline: “Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It’s fun to be a vampire”. The Lost Boys are coming back (Photo: Warner Brothers) \nHollywood bosses are staking millions on returning to Santa Carla for seven series, each set in a different decade starting with 1967. \nTV network The CW has already picked it up, its shows are often E4 or Sky One. Expect blood, snappy dialogue, and teens losing their heads. Baywatch \nA highly anticipated film version of Baywatch will reach our shores on June 2. \nCue hunks in trunks and sexy women in skimpy red cossies as lifeguards running in slo-mo on sun-drenched Californian beaches recreating one of TV’s most popular series, which ran for 10 years from 1989. Baywatch will hit our screens in June \nPumped Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson takes The Hoff’s role of Mitch and Pamela Anderson’s part, CJ Parker, will be played by Kelly Rohrbach. It also stars Zac Efron as Matt Brody. \nThe TV series attracted a weekly audience of 1.1 billion in 148 countries and was translated into 44 different languages. LA Law \nThe revamped version of L.A. Law has one of the original writers but it may not revolve entirely around fans’ favourites like 24: Legacy star Jimmy Smits, who played attorney Victor Sifuentes. LA Law \nThe reboot will feature new characters and is set in today’s Los Angeles but the makers say it keep some “beloved pieces” of the classic series, which ran from 1986 to 1994 and also starred Britain’s Amanda Donohoe, above. \nIt is thought the new show will be aimed at streaming ­channels and may feature some of the original cast as senior lawyers or judges. “It’s a blend of old and new,” said a spokesman. Magnum PI \nFormer Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria has a girl power twist in bringing back Magnum, which made a star of Tom Selleck as the wisecracking Hawaiian detective from 1980 to 1988. \nEva’s production company UnbeliEVAble Entertainment is making a series following Magnum’s daughter, Lily “Tommy” Magnum, as she returns to Hawaii to take up the mantle of her father’s private investigations company. Tom Selleck in Magnum (Photo: London Features International Ltd) \n“No one could replace Thomas Magnum so we decided to make this a sequel and continue the adventure of his ­daughter, who was established in the original series,” said Eva. It’s not confirmed that Selleck, 72, will have a cameo role. Dynasty \nWell, we hope so anyway. Shoulder pads were a big feature of Dynasty (Photo: London Features International) \nNone of the original cast have been confirmed but no Dynasty ­remake could be complete without Joan Collins’ Alexis Carrington and arch-rival Linda Evans. \nThe original shows ran from 1981 to 1989 and the new series will be a modern take on the big-haired, sharp-nailed classic, pitting a billionaire’s daughter against her soon-to-be stepmother. It will be made by the team behind Gossip Girl and The OC and focus on Blake Carrington’s daughter Fallon. \nBut there’s another big question in the battle of the Colbys and Carringtons – will those shoulder pads make a comeback?
