(Lloyd Fox) Meredith Cohn .\nStudies show a focus on patients' families can lead in some cases to shorter hospital stays and lower costs, Netzer said. Other studies suggest that after patients go home, the families are better equipped to provide care. That in turn could mean better quality of life for patients and fewer hospital readmissions.

They also include staff dedicated to helping families understand hospital procedures, social and spiritual support, more consistent updates and inclusion in medical decision-making, and even advice on providing care after the patient is released from the hospital. \nThe shift was welcomed by Peters, who works at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center , the last hospital that treated her sister before she died peacefully at home a year ago. \nMargi Kirst sat next to her son's hospital bed at Johns Hopkins Hospital as she and three hospital workers tried to interest him in a bunch of multicolored balls and Legos. \n\"Over here, Camden, look,\" said Yun Kim, an occupational therapist, as she waved a ball in front of Camden Colston's face,... \nMargi Kirst sat next to her son's hospital bed at Johns Hopkins Hospital as she and three hospital workers tried to interest him in a bunch of multicolored balls and Legos. \n\"Over here, Camden, look,\" said Yun Kim, an occupational therapist, as she waved a ball in front of Camden Colston's face,... (Carrie Wells) \n\"I found the people in the ICU really were angels and worked with us,\" she said. \"But my experience in the ICU may be different from some other folks, because maybe I learned what to ask. There's still probably work to do.\" \nThe former ICU guidelines were not based on any evidence of improved outcomes or lower costs, Netzer said. Still, many hospitals adopted some ways to accommodate patients' family members, but without spending much or upsetting the long-standing medical culture. \nChange should accelerate under the new guidelines, Netzer said. \n\"Some interventions cost money upfront, but in most cases things that improve family experiences may also conserve resources,\" said Netzer, also an associate professor of medicine, epidemiology and public health in the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \nThere are still a lot of gaps in the research, but University of Maryland Medical Center has forged ahead with changes in its ICUs, Netzer said. The rooms are bigger to accommodate family, who can visit at any time. The hospital produced pamphlets that explain how it works. Social workers now double as \"navigators\" who can facilitate communications with doctors or link families to services such as pastoral care or alternative therapies. \nThe hospital also launched a pilot program to see if patients benefit from extra measures such as allowing family members to attend rounds, a daily meeting of medical providers where patients' conditions are discussed and tests and treatments are decided. \nThere will be more changes in hospital ICUs nationally as studies show patients and their families are faring better with these accommodations, said Dr. Rebecca Aslakson, who also helped author the new guidelines as an associate professor of anesthesiology and critical-care medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:55:47.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
