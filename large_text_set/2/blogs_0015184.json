There have been reports of enough celeb birthday bashes gone both wrong and right to have us guessing about who will keep things classy and who will wake up outside a Target in a shopping cart with no pants on , and we honestly thought Miles’ bash would err toward beer pong and togas rather than the fresh, sophisticated event you’ll witness below.\n\nHappy to be proven wrong! Dare we say we wish we were invited?\nMiles Teller’s 3oth was more of a flirty thirty than a dirty one and we’re taking notes. Phillip Faraone / Getty Images for Absolut Elyx Cocktails came with a small bouquet of colorful pansies.\nPhillip Faraone / Getty Images for Absolut Elyx The set up was so fresh, we are guessing this room smelled amazing. It’s like a moody, indoor patio greenhouse.\nPhillip Faraone / Getty Images for Absolut Elyx No such thing as too much greenery. Imagine dressing your table with fresh herbs like this and letting guests garnish their own plates? The inspiration is endless. Plus, those little menu pockets in the napkins are the cutest.\nPhillip Faraone / Getty Images for Absolut Elyx Okay, so maybe you did expect a swankfest for Mr. Teller’s b-day. But did you expect rose gilded swans?\nPhillip Faraone / Getty Images for Absolut Elyx Even the lounge area was super chic:\nPhillip Faraone / Getty Images for Absolut Elyx We don’t know of any performer who wouldn’t at least take the chance to address the crowd, especially on his day:\nPhillip Faraone / Getty Images for Absolut Elyx Happy Birthday, Miles Teller!\nPhillip Faraone / Getty Images for Absolut Elyx Even that cake is too sophisticated for words! Look at that black piping detail and gold metallic frosting! The event was sponsored by Absolut Elyx, and held at the private residence of Jonas Tahlin, Absolut’s CEO. This is his house , people. If this is what a small birthday get together can look like, maybe we need to step up our game. Until then, those flowering cocktails are going to haunt our party-hosting dreams.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:10:19.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
