All you can see for about 10 seconds, is a football laying on the ground. Just when you think that's all it is going to be, Lucille comes out of nowhere and smashes the ball. \nAfter Negan 's Dirty Girl destroys the innocent football, the words appear on the screen, \"FOOTBALL SEASON IS OVER!\" \nTo end the trailer, it was announced that The Walking Dead would return next Sunday. The Walking Dead returns for the rest of its seventh season on February 12 at 9 p.m. ET on AMC . Fear the Walking Dead 's third season does not yet have a premiere date but with The Walking Dead finale set for April 2, expectations for Fear 's return are set for April 9.
