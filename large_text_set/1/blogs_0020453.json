Follow the budget debate on Holyrood Live \nScottish Labour has put forward a debate seeking a cross-party consensus against the government's budget proposals. \nDeputy leader Alex Rowley said members had \"the opportunity to send a message on the SNP's austerity budget\". \nHe said: \"The SNP in government has all been about spin and the short term, but Scotland's sluggish economy is because of a decade of cuts to education budgets. Our NHS is overwhelmed because care for the elderly has been underfunded. \n\"Labour has an alternate plan that would use the new powers of the Scottish Parliament to invest in our public services and grow our economy.\" Image caption Labour's Alex Rowley said Holyrood had the power to make different choices \nThe finance secretary has indicated he could \"not necessarily\" find common ground with the Conservatives or Labour over the budget, but said discussions with the Lib Dems and Greens had shown \"room for manoeuvre\". \nThe Lib Dems have asked for \"substantial changes\" , with up to £400m of extra spending on mental health, education, the police and transport. \nThe Greens meanwhile have asked for changes to the income tax in return for their backing, which they say will \"make the tax system fairer, reduce inequality in our society and generate additional funds for public services\". \nAhead of the debate, Labour highlighted figures in the budget showing the core funding going into council budgets falling by £327m, which they said was \"cutting into our future\". 'Just wrong' \nHowever, the SNP has said this does not take into account funding which will go direct to schools and health and social care partnerships, which they said would boost local services by several hundred million pounds. \nMr Mackay has said Labour are \"just wrong\" about the budget and are working in a \"Better Together alliance\" with the Conservatives. \nHe said: \"What the Labour Party are proposing to do is vote with the Tories against the Scottish budget, and in that budget we're proposing to allocate hundreds of millions of pounds more for our public services - to the NHS, to education and to local services. \n\"It's Labour that will be passing on austerity to the households of Scotland. \n\"Scotland is a wealthy and successful nation. The threat to Scotland's economy right now is Brexit and the Scottish government has set out a plan to put Scotland in the best possible position.\" Analysis by BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim \nThe government will probably lose this vote. \nLabour have drafted their motion in such a way to ensure support from the other opposition parties; none of them do support the budget \"in its current form\". \nBut Mr Mackay has acknowledged that. He knows he needs to move in some way towards the opposition parties; that's the point of the ongoing negotiations. \nThe debate itself is likely to follow a familiar format; there are enough different sets of figures in the 178-page draft for all sides to craft arguments. \nFor example Labour pointing to one set of numbers to show core council budgets falling, while the SNP point to another set to show local services funding on the rise. The same dance will repeated with the Tories over Scotland's funding from Westminster. \nIn terms of who is more likely to partner up with the SNP in the final budget votes, at the moment the Lib Dems seem the more likely candidate. \nThe Greens want to see changes over tax - and Mr Mackay is unlikely to budge on tax. The Lib Dems are asking an awful lot in terms of spending - but there is common ground on which to work.
