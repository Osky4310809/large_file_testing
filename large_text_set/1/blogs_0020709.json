Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, returned to the Capitol on Monday night and said it was \"light-hearted,\" joking that he was most entertained by seeing Trump and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, discuss which New York politicians were common friends.\nAfter the reception, Trump met privately with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin.
