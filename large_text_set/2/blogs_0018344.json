In a short video uploaded to LG’s official YouTube channel, the company revealed how the top half of the smartphone can be used as the viewfinder, while the bottom half can immediately display snapped pictures.\nThis isn’t just achievable because of LG’s camera app, but also thanks to the 18:9, or 2:1, display that the LG G6 will house. This allows for two 1:1 (square) images to appear side-by-side across the full screen — and the LG G6 can take advantage of this as well as making better use of other functions, such as Android Nougat’s split-screen feature.\nMost modern smartphones currently make use of 16:9 screen format — the same as found on most modern TVs — but the 18:9 Univisium format is set to become the new standard, and is being pushed by companies such as Netflix .\nSee also: LG to start supplying rival Samsung with LCD displays, confirms LG CEO 23 hours ago Whether this photo preview feature is a big advance is up for debate but, if nothing else, it shows that LG is at least considering the possibilities of the 18:9 format outside of streaming TV shows correctly.\nWhat are your current thoughts on LG’s advances with the G6?
