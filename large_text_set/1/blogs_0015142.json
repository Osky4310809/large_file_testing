And I’ve never had a chance to have a good sitdown with him. \nBut I like what he brings to the table and I’m excited that he’s coming to India. \nAs a 22-year-old, Mitchell came down to Sydney for the Matador Cup with the developmental Cricket Australia XI. \nIt was a hard learning curve for a young legspinner in a team that struggled against the experienced state sides. \nI got a look at him when he bowled at NSW at Bankstown Oval and, despite going wicketless, he held his own in a badly beaten team. \nWe got to know him a bit better last year during our series last year in Sri Lanka. Mitchell was there with the national performance squad but linked up with the Test squad and spent his time bowling to the guys in the nets. Mitchell Swepson has improved greatly in the past 18 months. Picture: Ian Currie Source: News Corp Australia \nBut it was my last chance at seeing him up close which has me excited about what Mitchell can bring to the Australian side. \nJust three months ago I went up to the Gabba for a Shield game with NSW and saw firsthand how far this kid has come. \nHe’s improved so much over the past 18 months and he’s got a lot more consistent with the way he bowls. \nWhat’s exciting is that not only is he accurate, but he really gives the ball a good rip. That’s a dangerous combination. \nMitchell’s going to be presented with a lot of challenges in India – as will all of our players, but that’s one of the joys of touring. \nHe’s obviously going to have to adapt and possibly bowl a little bit different in those conditions and find the right paces to bowl. \nHe’ll have to work hard to get the right positioning of the seam and things like that. \nBut really, it’s going to be a good challenge for him to go over there and he’ll become a much better player because of it. \nEven if he doesn’t play I think he’ll learn a lot from being there, being around the group and seeing how to play in those conditions. \nMost of the young guys are pretty quiet to begin with and then start to come out of their shell. \nBut I know Mitchell will fit in well within the group and that’s why this could be a great experience for him. \nBecause at 23 he’s certainly a bright prospect for the future. Successful at the SCG, but who will line up in Pune? Picture: Phil Hillyard Source: News Corp Australia \nSETTLING ON AN X I FOR PUNE \nI think the selectors have got a pretty good idea of what the team for the first Test will be - but it’s still a month away so I’m not going to share it with the world and give away all our secrets just yet. Just in case Virat is reading. \nAnd of course we have some preparation in the UAE and a tour game to focus on first. \nIf someone really smashes the lights out then they could come out of the pack. \nSo we’ve got a bit of time to have a look and see how guys are preparing in those conditions, and that’s pretty handy. \nBut what I do like is the variety of the squad and the options we’ve picked. \nThree fast bowlers. Six batters. A bunch of all-rounders, spinning all-rounders and then there’s the spinners. \nIndia isn’t an easy place to travel but we’ve got all bases covered. \nIt’s a strong squad to go over and compete in those conditions. Steve O'Keefe and Ashton Agar will have big roles to play in India. Picture: Gregg Porteous Source: News Corp Australia \nVARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE \nWhen you pick a squad of 16 players, you’d like to think you can cram in everyone you wanted and I think we’ve done that. \nBut what is particularly impressive is the range of skills we’re bring across in the spin department: they’re all different in the way they bowl. \nWith India’s batting lineup being largely dominated by right-handers, it is important that we have some spinners who can take the ball away from those players. \nThat’s where Mitchell Swepson can be a factor, and why Steve O’Keefe and Ashton Agar could be crucial on this tour. \nBut we’ve also got Nathan Lyon and Glenn Maxwell who bring the ball in to the right-hander, so as a captain I won’t be short of options to choose from.
