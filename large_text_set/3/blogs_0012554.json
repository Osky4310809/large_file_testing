Peter Byrne/PA Wire/PA Images \nHugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster and Britain's youngest billionaire, has been branded one of the world's most eligible bachelors. \nBut, according to The Daily Telegraph , the 26-year-old is officially off the market. \nThe newspaper reported that he met his new girlfriend, Harriet Tomlinson, when they were both students at the £30,000 a year private Ellesmere College in Shopshire. She grew up in Chester near his family estate, the 11,000-acre Eaton Hall. \nThe couple recently posted photos of a holiday to California. A source close to Grosvenor told The Mirror that the pair are \"blissfully happy,\" calling Tomlinson \"very down to earth and family orientated.\" \nGrosvenor inherited the majority of a £9.3 billion ($11.5 billion) fortune and became the seventh Duke of Westminster when his father, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, died of a heart attack nine months ago at the age of 64 . \nHe is the third richest person in the UK, the richest person under 30 in Britain, and the 68th richest person in the world. \nThe family's estate, Eaton Hall. YouTube \nThe family owns a wealth of property, including 300 acres in Mayfair and Belgravia, as well as land across the British Isles, in Oxford, Chesire, Scotland, and Spain. \nGrosvenor works as an accounts manager at a green energy firm, while Tomlinson is a consultant at recruitment firm Deverell Smith. \nThe Duke is one of Prince George's godparents, and attended the royal's christening at St. James's Palace . \nHe has three sisters — Lady Tamara, Lady Edwina, and Lady Viola — but aristocratic etiquette dictates that the first-born son inherits the estate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:27:31.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
