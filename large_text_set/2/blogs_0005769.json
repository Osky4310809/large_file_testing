You’ve not considered whether you as leader are damaging the party?” \nCorbyn replied: “I’m really surprised the BBC is reporting fake news. There is no news.” \nDuring last year’s leadership election campaign Jeremy Corbyn ’s team had set up a website called CorbynFacts, purporting to “fact check” inaccurate reporting of the Labour leader in the media. \nBut the Mirror revealed it contained a string of misleading claims and demonstrable falsehoods. Read More \nAfter the Mirror reported the inaccuracies, the website changed its name to “Behind the Headlines”, removing the word “facts” from the masthead. \nFake news has become a hot button issue in recent months. \nThe term was originally coined to describe deliberately falsified articles published online to attack political candidates and spread disinformation. \nBut the term has recently been co-opted by politicians including Donald Trump, and used to delegitimise critical reporting by focusing on minor inaccuracies. \nAsked if he would meet Donald Trump on his state visit to the UK, Corbyn said: “My position is Donald Trump should not be coming to the UK. I think we have to have relations with the USA, I’m not sure he’s going to want to have a meeting with us.” \nAsked if that was an answer to the question, he said: “No.” \nHe went on: “The point is Donald Trump has been promoting something that undermines international law. He’s been promoting misogyny, he’s been making some awful statements in the USA and threatening to build a wall against Mexico and our government seems to think this is a man they should do deals with. \n“I think we should be challenging Trump on international law issues and we should also be not rolling out the red carpet to him.” Read More Donald Trump staff threatens to kick CNN out of press conference, branding them 'fake news' \nCorbyn noted that he’s been asked before whether he’d meet Trump, and he said it would be useful for him to visit a Mosque in Finsbury Park for tea and a chat. \nBut he added: “I think it would be right to meet the President of the USA, but it would be wrong for him to come here.
