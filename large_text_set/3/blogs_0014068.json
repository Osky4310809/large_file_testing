As they head back to work over the next few days, a few may be wondering how to make telecommuting a permanent lifestyle. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , about a quarter of American employees did at least some of their work from home in 2015, and companies are finding that providing workers the opportunity to work from home can help persuade a candidate who's weighing one job offer against another. \nEarlier this year, job search site FlexJobs released its annual list of the top 100 companies with the most postings for \"remote friendly\" jobs — those that offer the potential for partial or full telecommuting — in the past year. \nEmployers in healthcare, information technology and customer service dominated, though companies in industries like education, sales and finance were also well-represented. \nSara Sutton Fell, founder and CEO of FlexJobs, argues that the diversity of industries represented on the list should help \"to dispel the common myth that remote jobs are only available for computer-related fields or for customer service positions.\" \"If you want to attract and retain the best talent, it's time to get flexible.\" -Sara Sutton Fell, founder and CEO of FlexJobs \nShe also notes that the increasing types of opportunities for flexible work, including remote options, flexible schedules, part-time professional work, and freelance, reflects the changing nature of remote work.

The message to employers, says Sutton Fell, is clear. \n\"If you want to attract and retain the best talent, it's time to get flexible.\" \nHere are FlexJobs' top companies for people who want to work from home: \n1.
