Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTheo Walcott has received a birthday pick-me-up from Arsene Wenger on the day he was dropped from the England squad. \nParty-pooper Gareth Southgate wiped the smile off Walcott's face as he celebrated turning 28 on Thursday, leaving the Arsenal forward out of his latest squad despite being short on firepower. \nThe bad news came just hours after Wenger hailed birthday-boy Walcott 's development and claimed he has become a more complete and efficient player this season. \nAnd, ironically, Wenger pinpointed Walcott's omission from England's Euro 2016 squad as a big factor in his improved form this season.

He has been less injured as well, that helps. \n“He has turned up in big games as well, he can score goals in big games. He showed that against Bayern, he scored the goal and I think it was a penalty on him and he can influence games.

Always in life you try and get to the next level when things don't go for you or you think you do everything right and continue to live like you did before – and he had the right response. \n“He said 'What do I need to do to get higher up?' and he did it.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:57:22.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
