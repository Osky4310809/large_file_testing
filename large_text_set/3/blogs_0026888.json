Their business is being children. — Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) March 26, 2017 \nActor William Shatner noted that an anti-leggings ruling is a problem for him, too. — William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) March 26, 2017 \nComedian Sarah Silverman wrote that she's boycotting United, because the airline's attire rules are much stricter on women than men. I understand. I suggest u consider updating ur rules 4 friends & fam as they seem to apply mostly 2 females & are outdated. https://t.co/41chqN32Q0 — Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) March 26, 2017 \nStars including LeVar Burton and Keegan Allen also tweeted directly to United, complaining that the attire rules are unjust, and Seth Rogen sarcastically tweeted that United is \"Cool, right?\" because the airline is just \"trying to police the attire of the daughters of our employees!\" We here at @united are just trying to police the attire of the daughters of our employees! That's all! Cool, right? https://t.co/xGyL4IAslE — Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 26, 2017 \nSupermodel Chrissy Teigen chimed in , \"I have flown united before with literally no pants on.
