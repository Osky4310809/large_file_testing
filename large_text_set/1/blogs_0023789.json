But J.K. Rowling has revealed that this wasn’t always the case in the world of magic. BuzzFeed spotted a tidbit on Pottermore that illuminates how some wizards heeded the call of nature. It’s, uh, kind of weird. \nBuried in a mid-sentence aside about the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, Rowling tells us this: \nHogwarts’ plumbing became more elaborate in the eighteenth century (this was a rare instance of wizards copying Muggles, because hitherto they simply relieved themselves wherever they stood, and vanished the evidence)... \nThis really raises more questions than it answers. Did they also make themselves invisible while they did their business? And where did it vanish to? Please, please let Rowling create an entire page devoted to wizard plumbing soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:35:47.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
