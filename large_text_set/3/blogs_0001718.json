Because of where the tumor was, the options to treat it were limited. \n“When they said it’s inoperable…I just didn’t know what to say,” John Jagielski said. \nThe Jagielski’s, who have two dogs, say they’re children to them so they were ready to fight to save Beau. \n“We were willing to go that extra mile and get him help no matter what it cost,” Cindy said. \nIn October, when Beau was diagnosed, the Stanton Heights couple was given two options. \nThe first was to treat the tumor with traditional radiation therapy, which includes 20 sessions, five days a week for four weeks in a row. \n“That’s just too taxing, too taxing for the dog,” Cindy said. \nThe other option was to travel 300 miles to Cincinnati, Ohio for Stereotactic Radiosurgery or SRS. \nLess than 20 specialty centers across the country have this technology. \nPetCure Oncology operates the radiation oncology department in Cincinnati. They were able to get Beau into treatment in less than a week. \nThree treatments later, Beau’s symptoms disappeared. \n“Boy it gave us such hope. We were like Beau is gonna beat this,” Cindy said. \nNow, stereotactic radiosurgery is here in Pittsburgh. \nThe Pittsburgh Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Center is one of just five PetCure Oncology sites in the United States. \nDr. Sherwood Johnson is a veterinarian at PVSEC. The Camp Horne Road location got SRS in mid-January. \n“What this machine does is it images with a CT scanner as it treats so it’s defining where that tumor is and really targeting down on that tumor,” Dr. Johnson said. \nOne of the most remarkable things about the machine is its ability to rotate 360 degrees all while continuously treating the tumor. \nThe treatment delivers a higher dose of radiation faster and with fewer side effects. \n“We can treat tumors in areas where they couldn’t be treated before either because we couldn’t access them, or we would damage tissues and this is so much more precise in its delivery of radiation that that’s not an issue anymore,” Dr. Johnson said. \nBeau’s treatment cost $9,000. \nTraditional radiation would’ve been $6,500. \nAlthough expensive, the Jagielski’s say they’d do it again in a heartbeat. A follow up MRI in May will show what the future holds for Beau. \nIn the meantime, the Jagielski’s are happy to have the time with him now. \n“One day, Beau’s time will come and when it does we’ll be prepared for it, but we have extra time with him and that we cherish,” Cindy said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T08:53:15.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
