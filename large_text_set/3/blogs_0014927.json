(Photo: Lions Gate) (Photo: Lions Gate) \n\"She hasn't fully figured it out yet. I think what's great about that scene and what that scene propels for the rest of the movie is, 'That's OK'. \n\"The movie is saying, 'That's OK' and all of the kids have to own who they are and find their tribe.\" \nThe character's sexuality was welcomed by actor David Yost, who played the blue Ranger in the original 90s TV series and is gay.
