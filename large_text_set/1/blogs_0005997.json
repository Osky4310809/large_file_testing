Stanislas fired a long pass to Daniels on the left flank and the full-back skipped inside a challenge from the sleeping Hector Bellerin before side-footing home at the near post. \nIt got worse for Arsenal four minutes later, as Granit Xhaka shoved Fraser to ground inside the area on a Bournemouth break, allowing Wilson to sweep the ball down the middle and into the net from the penalty spot. \nAaron Ramsey, starting in the number 10 role in place of Ozil, flashed a shot wide on the turn, but Arsenal struggled to cause any undue problems for Artur Boruc and the Bournemouth defence. \nIndeed, it almost got worse for the Gunners before the break, with Stanislas bending a shot inches wide of Cech's left-hand post from 20 yards in stoppage time at the end of the half. \nArsenal turned up the pressure early in the second half, but they thought they were 3-0 down after 55 minutes, only for referee Michael Oliver to award a handball in their favour after Wilson diverted Harry Arter's shot into the net with his arm. \nBut Bournemouth only needed another two minutes to send the Vitality Stadium into dreamland. Fraser chased down a long ball with Bellerin before nudging the defender to the ground, striding into the area from the left and slotting low past Cech and into the bottom corner. \nHowever, things soon unravelled for the home side. Sanchez dived to nod Giroud's header across goal into the net and give the Gunners a glimmer of a comeback with 20 minutes to play, before Lucas volleyed in expertly from a tight angle five minutes later to leave home fans fearing the worst. \nBournemouth lost Francis to a straight red card in the closing stages for a lunge on Ramsey and Arsenal made their superior numbers count, with Giroud glancing Xhaka's cross from the right into the bottom corner to salvage a draw.
