I’ve seen many athletes try and they’ve come way short. \n“I remember the first time I saw him (Van Niekerk) run and afterwards and my coach (Glen Mills) sat me down and said ‘there are only two people who can break this 400m world record’. \n“I said ‘who is that?’ and he said ‘one is you, and one is Wayde van Niekerk.’ \n“He said it to me earlier when we had the discussion about the 400m. He said ‘you have to have the speed. If you don’t have speed, you can’t break Michael Johnson’s world record’. \n“Wayde has the speed and the strength and determination.” \nVan Niekerk had spent a brief spell training with Bolt in Jamaica in the build-up to Rio, and the soon-to-be retired Olympic champion says he saw something special in the young South African during that time. \n“Just by training with him earlier in the year you can tell that he really works hard. For me it was just brilliant to have seen him break the world record and I was really happy for him,” said Bolt. \nVan Niekerk is now seriously considering adding the 200m to his repertoire, and while he is still figuring that all out, Bolt has no doubts that he could make the switch.“I know that he’s going to run a good 200m because he’s very strong and I can tell that he’s fast by the 100m that he’s run,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:56:19.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
