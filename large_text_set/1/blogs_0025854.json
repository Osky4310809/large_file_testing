The entire Bollywood and so-called liberals have pronounced SKRS as a right-wing fringe group that has tried to muzzle the right to free speech and expression. Since this was a Bollywood affair, everyone had to jump into the argument and show their solidarity against lumpen elements. There is no way one can justify violence but all that SKRS and other Rajput organisations have been demanding for many months is an assurance from Bhansali that Rani Padmini’s history will not be distorted. \nWhile this controversy has dominated headlines, another story has been playing out in the north-eastern state of Manipur which is scheduled to go to polls on March 18. Najma Bibi, Manipur’s first Muslim woman candidate is contesting from Irom Sharmila’s People’s Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA) party. Rather than extend full support, Manipuri Muslim clerics have issued Bibi a warning that she will not be given space for her grave in the village. For all the rant and vociferous opposition to SKRS, the so-called gladiators of free speech seemed to have hid their tails between their legs on this issue. \nBibi and Iron Lady, Sharmila, have even met the Governor about how Muslim clerics are trying to ostracise her for contesting assembly elections. Bibi is in the fray from Wabgai seat which along with Lilong are the two Muslim-dominated seats in a state which has 60 assembly seats. This is not the first time Bibi has faced persecution from clerics. She had earlier helped Muslim women become financially independent through self-help groups and encouraged them to raise issues like domestic violence. \nIf the liberals are so enraged by the Bhansali episode, then what explains their deafening silence on Najma Bibi? The selective outrage is only reserved for mainstream events without any concern for local sentiments. Yet when a Najma Bibi tries to break the shackles and give a coherent voice to the women of Manipur, these armchair liberals prefer to remain silent.
