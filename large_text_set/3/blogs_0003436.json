This was despite House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez's earlier warning that lawmakers will be stripped of their committee chairmanships and deputy speakerships if they vote against the policy. \nIn a radio interview after the proceeding, Alvarez said he would no longer negotiate with those who will be removed from their posts and would instead review a \"long list\" of candidates to replace them. \nLipa Rep. Vilma Santos, a celebrated actress, and Ilocos Norte Rep. Imelda Marcos, a former first lady, also voted against the proposed legislation. \nDeath penalty is considered to be a primary part of President Rodrigo Duterte's legislative agenda in his campaign against crime. House leaders were confident of the chamber's approval on Tuesday through a so-called \"supermajority\" allied to Duterte. \nThe current version approved on final reading only seeks to punish crimes related to illegal drugs while leaving out rape, treason and plunder, which were included in the earlier committee version.   'Turning point... for the worse' \nThe local arm of human rights organization Amnesty International was quick to condemn the decision of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, saying it is not a solution to crime. \n\"The frustration and fear felt by many Filipinos because of high rates of crime deserves a genuine answer—not a short-term placebo solution offered through the death penalty as a means of retribution,\" Ritz Lee Santos, Amnesty Philippines board chairperson, said in a statement. \nSantos said the lower house should have instead used the time allotted for deliberations on the death penalty to come up with policies that address \"institutional weaknesses—notably within the police and judiciary—that help contribute to high crime rates.\" \nThe International Commission on Jurists, meanwhile, said the approval of the death penalty represents a \"turning point in the country, but one that is for the worse.\" \n\"It puts the Philippines in direct conflict with its international legal obligations,\" Emerlynne Gil, the commission's legal adviser for Southeast Asia, said. \n\"Passing this law will send a negative message to the international community that the Philippines is incapable of observing in good faith the international obligations it has expressly bound itself to,\" Gil added. \nThe Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines similarly expressed disapproval of the move and urged the faithful to continue opposing the death sentence as a violation of life and dignity. — Camille Diola  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T14:47:50.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
