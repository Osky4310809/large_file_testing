Most of that is thanks to the new EMUI 5, which provides a far superior user experience to anything we've seen in earlier Huawei phones. And because the UI is so much improved, the rest of the phone shines through.\nOne thing that wasn't included in the previously-released versions of the Mate 9 was Amazon Alexa support, which will come in a forthcoming update, according to ZDNet . It's unclear how Huawei plans to integrate Alexa into the phone — perhaps offering it as a stand-in to Google Assistant in a hands-free form — but after seeing it [debut on a refrigerator](http://www.androidcentral.com/lgs-new-webos-powered-refrigerator-has-amazon-alexa-voice-control and countless other gadgets at CES 2017, it will be interesting to see how it functions on a handset. The Alexa-enabled version will reportedly be sold as a separate model from the one launching this week, but details are scarce at this point.\nHuawei Mate 9 specs \nThe \"regular\" Mate 9 will be available starting January 6 at Amazon, Newegg, Best Buy and B&H Photo in separate grey and silver models.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T07:05:34.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
