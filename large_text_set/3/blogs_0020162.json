Al Franken's question on Priebus' comments.\nGorsuch added: \"I don't appreciate it when people characterize me ... I am a judge, I am my own man.\"\nWhen Franken asked if he was comfortable with Priebus describing his nomination that way, Gorsuch said \"there is a lot about this process I am uncomfortable with.\" J\nFranken also grilled Gorsuch about the case of the freezing truck driver who had been fired after he had driven away from his broken trailer after waiting several hours for help. The temperature was 14 below zero.\nWhile the 10th Circuit Court panel upheld an administrative judge's ruling in favor of the fired driver, Gorsuch dissented. He said the law would have protected a driver who refused to operate an unsafe vehicle, but it did not protect a trucker who drove away from his trailer.\n\"I had a career in identifying absurdity, and I know it when I see it,\" said Franken, a former \"Saturday Night Live\" performer and writer. \"It makes me question your judgment.\" He pressed Gorsuch to say what he would have done when faced with the driver's predicament.\n\"I don't know what I would have done if I were in his shoes. I don't blame him at all for doing what he did do. I thought a lot about this case. I totally empathize.\"\nFranken shot back. \"I would have done exactly what he did. And I think everyone here would have done exactly what he did. And I think it is an easy answer.\"\nIn response to questioning from Minnesota's other senator, Amy Klobuchar, Gorsuch said he has \"an open mind\" about cameras in the Supreme Court and acknowledged that there were justices on both sides of the issue.\nMost justices have expressed opposition to cameras, including some who seemed open to the idea at their own Senate confirmation hearings.\nKlobuchar and four other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee introduced legislation last week to allow cameras during open proceedings of the Supreme Court. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is also a sponsor.\nThe committee approved similar bills in 2010 and 2012, but the proposal has never become law.\nKlobuchar also asked Gorsuch if an originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution allows women to be president. She also sought out his views on the First Amendment when it comes to campaign finance laws as well as judicial ethics rules.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:36:08.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
