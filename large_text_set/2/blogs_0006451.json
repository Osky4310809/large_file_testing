The Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit.\nGovernment lawyers argued that the ban was a “lawful exercise” of the president’s authority and that the seven countries have raised terrorism concerns.\nThe states said Trump’s executive order unconstitutionally blocked entry based on religion.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:26:48.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
