In total, the carrier's workers have seen their base pay increase by nearly 25% since 2015.\nEmployees at fellow legacy carrier, United, earned $628 million in shared profits for 2016 while American Airlines' own profit sharing program kicks off this year.\nSEE ALSO: Warren Buffett is investing $8 billion in an industry he once called a 'death trap' NOW WATCH: How billionaire hedge fund titan Steve Cohen walked away from the biggest insider trading scandal in history   Delta Air lines", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:11:03.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
