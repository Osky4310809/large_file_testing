That is why we need to protect our borders and make it clear you can only enter Europe legally,” Szijjártó explained. “We must stop encouraging immigration and finally abolish the forced resettlement quota, which violates European rules.” \nAs to why there had been public support issued for then-candidate Trump by Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban during the presidential campaign, something not seen broadly across most of the European Union, Szijjártó said: “We think that the direction of foreign policy and migration policy of Donald Trump for Europe is much more favorable than those of the Democrats.” \nVestnick Kavkaza reported that Szijjártó stated, “In my opinion, the Trump administration will be better for the whole world.”   \nHe later added that Hungary was “optimistic” about the “rationality even in foreign policy” its officials had seen thus far from the incoming Trump administration, according to Daily News Hungary . \nThe foreign minister further revealed that Orban had spoken by phone with Trump shortly after the election, and that a meeting between the two had been tentatively scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., shortly after Trump’s inauguration. \nThe rest of the interview dealt largely with Szijjártó stressing the importance of “fiscal discipline” by the EU and EU members, his touting of Hungary’s close economic and political relationship with Germany, and his country’s desire for increased cooperation and mutual respect between the EU member nations and Russia. \nThough many of the elitist, progressive socialists who run the EU have decried Trump’s election and have stated their opposition to a number of his proposed policies, at least one European country is looking forward to working with Trump, as they share a similar vision of how things should be both in Europe and the world more broadly.
