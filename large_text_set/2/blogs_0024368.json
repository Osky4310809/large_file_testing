King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 11 hours ago 1 \nFluff just posted a video to let the world know that Rest, Repose is looking for a new singer. \nThe musician said in the clip: \"Our singer, Tanner, has decided to graciously step down and pursue real life. And that's OK, I love Tanner and we wish him the best. \n\"Rest, Repose is now looking for a singer. Now, when I say singer, I mean a guy who can bring it and I mean someone who can tour. This part is important because we're gonna do that. \n\"So if you have 3 kids, a wife, a job that allows you only 2 weeks of vacation, please do not apply. But if you are a nice guy, a generous guy, girl, guy that fits the bill, email the address restreposeband@gmail.com or go on over to the Rest, Repose Facebook and hit us up.\"Last week, the band posted the following announcement :\"Hi All. We wanted to take a moment to update you on some things in our lives. Our MAIN goal in becoming a band again was to be able to tour as much as we can, to play live shows for all the people that want to see it. That being said. Tour is not for everyone. The schedule, Financial and job security of being in a touring band is not for everyone, And for that reason Tanner has decided to step down.\"We regret this decision, but respect it, and respect him. The dude is an unreal singer and it's a huge loss. But our first priority is coming to see you guys, and play shows across the globe.\"We will be on the singer search (yes again ) soon and will provide details as to what we are looking for in the future 5th piece of this band. Thanks for everything.\"The boys also included a letter from Tanner, which reads: \"Hey everyone, Tanner here. First of all, I want to thank all of you who lent your support toward landing me a position with Rest, Repose. What started off as a vocal cover just for the hell of it quickly turned into an opportunity to work with a group of dudes I've followed musically and on YouTube and admired for quite a while.\"Unfortunately, my life obligations restrict me in the sense that I am unable to tour to the extent this band requires to be successful. I have absolutely enjoyed working with everyone, there have been zero creative differences with anyone in Rest, Repose, and all the guys have been so incredibly accommodating to work around my schedule. But to my own dismay, life happens, or at least has its ups and downs.\"These guys deserve the chance to go far. They deserve the chance to be successful. And they deserve a 5th man at the front of the stage with not only the right voice, but the right circumstances in life to be there alongside the team that is Rest, Repose, every step of the way.With that being said, I have chosen to step out of my role as the vocalist for Rest, Repose to make room for someone who can meet their touring needs. This also means that I will not be on this album. Hopefully I can still be involved on a different level.\"I wish Fluff, Jared, Tony and Josh the best of luck going forward, and thank you all for the support I personally received from you all.Much love and respect to all. -Tanner\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:15:23.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
