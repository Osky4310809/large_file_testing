He was also a fierce believer in his home city of Detroit, and the role that the Tigers and sports played in contributing to civic pride and renewal. \n\"Mr. Ilitch led a decorated life of service to his country, accomplishment in business and philanthropy in all of his endeavors. He was also extremely supportive of me both personally and professionally. On behalf of all of Major League Baseball and Mr. Ilitch's countless friends and admirers throughout the game, I extend my deepest condolences to his wife Marian and their entire family, the Tigers organization, their fans and his fellow citizens of Detroit.\" Red Wings general manager Ken Holland praised Ilitch after learning about his death, describing him as \" the very best, nobody better. He was passionate not only about the team but the city of Detroit,\" per ESPN's Pierre LeBrun . Former Detroit Tigers pitcher and current Fox Sports broadcaster C.J. Nitkowski echoed Holland's sentiments: CJ Nitkowski @CJNitkowski Mr. I was what every sports fan and player wanted in an owner. Loved his city and was driven to win.
