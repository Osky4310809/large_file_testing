Government is investing $100-million to give tech start-up companies access to the capital they need to thrive in the marketplace and generate jobs for British Columbians. The technology sector supports the B.C. economy at its very foundation and is a key driver of growth for our economy, creating 86,000 jobs that pay 60% higher wages than the average. The sector is outpacing the overall economy, adding $13.9 billion to B.C.’s GDP and growing 4.7% higher than the overall provincial economy. For more information about the #BCTECH Strategy, please visit www.bctechstrategy.ca . (flickr.com) \nIn addition to the $100-million BC Tech Fund, which creates an avenue for capital funding for promising start-up companies, the plan highlights K-12 curriculum which provides the opportunity for more than 600,000 B.C. students to gain basic skills needed for careers in technology. Targeted programs include coding academies, greater access to work experience electives for high school students, and dual credit partnerships between secondary and post-secondary institutions.

All of the above help make up the three pillars of the #BCTECH Strategy: Capital, Talent, and access to Markets.
