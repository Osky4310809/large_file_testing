As expected from the diva, she wowed the crowd with her dancing, singing, and rapping skills. \nHer final score was an impressive 96 out of 100, but it was unfortunately not enough to beat T4’s score of 98, the highest score ever on the show. \nWhat do you think of Insooni’s version of BTS?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:52:38.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
