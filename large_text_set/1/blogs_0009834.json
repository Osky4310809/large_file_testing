He’s such an incredibly graceful and humorous speaker — not to mention, we’re just really gonna miss him. But imagine being in his family and listening; that would be even more crazy emotional!\nIn fact, his eldest daughter, Malia, cried throughout the whole thing, and we’re not surprised. Michelle Obama opened up about Malia crying during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon , and yup, we totally get it. Imagine if that was your dad up there, saying goodbye to every American!\nIn the clip, Obama mentions how she didn’t expect her husband’s goodbye to be a big deal because they knew it was coming, but the transition actually affected them quite significantly. And it seems like Malia was shocked by her own reaction.\n“Malia looked over at me and she says, ‘I can’t believe it, I’m going to cry through the whole speech,’ and I was like, ‘it’s okay.'” via GIPHY It is definitely okay, and perfectly healthy, to cry when you need to. Hey, it’s actually good for you ! So when you feel the tears coming on, just let them flow. \nEven Fallon admitted he “lost it at home,” and cried on his wife’s shoulder! And then there’s the Obamas’ other daughter Sasha, who actually missed the speech altogether because she was studying for exams …but she probably cried when she watched it back later.\nWe’re super sad to be saying farewell to President Obama, but at the same time, he deserves a break after eight years in the Oval Office. Plus, we’re super confident we haven’t seen the last of him, and that he’ll go on to do some pretty amazing things in the coming years.\nH/T: Us Weekly \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T21:33:30.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
