Posted 10 hours ago 4 \nOpeth frontman Mikael Akerfeldt told Ultimate Guitar that a fair portion of today's metal bands lack originality and excitement in their sound, branding them \"unnecessary.\" \nThe musician commented: \"It's easy to put bands down, especially in the metal scene. There are a lot of bands I just think are unnecessary. [Laughs] \n\"They don't have to be there. Most of the time I hear a song from a band it feels like I get it right away, if you know what I mean. I'm more interested in music when I hear something and it doesn't necessarily have to be completely new or something I haven't heard before. \n\"But I want something to make me go, 'Oh, that's odd. That's interesting.' That's what I've developed into myself, which is why I'm very cynical about the metal scene.\" \nMikael continued: \"I've discovered so much from old music and I developed this songwriting approach from listening to older artists and bands and that shaped me for what I'm doing now. Even if we're a contemporary band, all the influences come from all these fantastic older bands, which basically makes it sound the way we do. \n\"It's not because we listen to what's going on today or anything like that. That also has me kind of frowning upon the music scene as it is today. That it's not really so exciting. It's very rare for me to listen to something and go, 'Hmm. That' cool. That's interesting.'\" \nStressing the importance of being open to various styles of music, Akerfeldt concluded: \"I wrote the best metal riffs from listening to old shit that doesn't have anything to do with metal. Which a lot of people might think sounds strange but that's how it is. Because I stopped consuming that contemporary metal music by the time we did our first record [1995's ' Orchid '] pretty much.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T05:27:18.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
