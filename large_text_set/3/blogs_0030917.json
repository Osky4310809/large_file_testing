Add the onions, garlic, green and red peppers, and car­rots. Cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add the beef and cook, stirring frequently, until the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in all the remaining ingredients except the beans. Bring every­­thing to a boil, adjust the heat to medium low, cover, and simmer until the liquid has reduced and the flavors meld, about 45 minutes. Stir in the beans and cook, uncovered, until the chili has thickened, another 15 minutes or so. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.
