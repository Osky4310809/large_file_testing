With Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, speaking of an “India first” strategy, the company on Wednesday announced Aadhaar linking features for its newly launched lite app version of Skype. While this will happen over the current year, expect LinkedIn to move towards Aadhaar integration as well. So, prospective employers looking for your profile would be able to authenticate your identity not just over LinkedIn, but also during a job interview over Skype. More important, with the company looking at increasing its India operations with Project Sangam, aimed at skilling, one can expect Microsoft to have a database of Aadhaar-linked users whose skills can be mapped with job openings. \nYou May Also Want To Watch: \nAadhaar integration, however, doesn’t stop with Microsoft; last year, telecom service providers started using Aadhaar for eKYC for connections, and one can soon expect a wide range of companies to do the same.
