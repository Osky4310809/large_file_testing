A significant number of women, especially low-income women, have obtained insurance coverage through their state’s marketplace and Medicaid expansion under the ACA. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the uninsured rate among women has decreased by 9 percentage points, resulting in approximately 9.5 million previously uninsured women gaining affordable, comprehensive health coverage. \nIn addition to expanding coverage, the ACA includes robust protections that have uniquely benefited women by curbing discriminatory practices in the health insurance system. Prior to the passage of the ACA, women were commonly charged more for the same health insurance plan as men — a practice called “gender rating.” As a result, women paid $1 billion more than men each year for insurance, according to the National Women’s Law Center. The ACA made this practice illegal. \nThe ACA also ended insurers’ ability to refuse coverage for women who had “pre-existing” conditions, including breast cancer, a history of Cesarean section and even prior treatment for domestic violence or sexual assault. \nBeyond outlawing unfair insurance practices, the ACA substantially improved affordability of basic women’s health care. It mandated that insurance companies completely cover the cost, without cost-sharing (i.e., copayments or deductibles) of a range of preventive services, such as contraception and contraceptive counseling, intimate personal violence screening and counseling, breastfeeding support and supplies, gestational diabetes screening, and cervical and breast cancer screening. Thus, 55 million women now have preventive services covered without cost-sharing. \nThe inclusion of birth control coverage is particularly salient because 99 percent of all U.S. women who have ever had sexual intercourse have used contraception at some point in their lives, and the average woman spends about 30 years trying to avoid pregnancy. Because of the ACA, U.S. women saved more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs on just the birth control pill in 2013 alone, according to estimates from one study. \nThe ACA also requires that all insurance companies cover maternity care and mental health care, services that were commonly excluded by individual insurers. In fact, prior to the ACA, only 12 percent of plans sold in the individual market covered maternity care, according to the National Women’s Law Center. \nThe House Republicans’ newly proposed health care bill seeks to repeal parts of the ACA as well as curb Medicaid expansion and defund Planned Parenthood. These changes will be devastating to women’s health care. Women have greater health care needs (including preventive services and maternity care) and are more likely to use prescription medications (including contraception) than men. Thus, the effects of repeal will likely be disproportionately felt by women. \nDevoid of the protections and no-cost preventive services afforded by the ACA, insurance coverage offered under Medicaid expansions and safety net services provided by Planned Parenthood, access to and affordability of comprehensive women’s health care will be severely compromised. These losses will disproportionately affect low-income women and women of color, furthering health inequities. \nCurtailing women’s access to health services threatens not only their health and productivity, but also the economic stability and well-being of their families as they incur increased health care costs. Before legislators begin to dismantle the ACA, we must demand to know how they will protect the historic gains women have had under it. \nSonya Borrero is an associate professor of medicine and director of the Center for Women’s Health Research and Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T09:41:39.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
