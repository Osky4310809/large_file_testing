Brauchler told the court. “What is most insidious about the decision to drink and drive … is that we can do nothing to protect ourselves from it.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T05:19:24.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
