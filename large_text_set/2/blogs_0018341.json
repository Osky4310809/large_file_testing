But first he must survive a deadly gladatorial contest that pits him against his former ally and fellow Avenger – The Incredible Hulk!” \nSounds like they need to laugh. https://t.co/fCB5AwQoDA — Taika Waititi (@TaikaWaititi) February 21, 2017 \nThor: Ragnarok is directed by Taika Waititi, written by Craig Kyle, and returns Chris Hemsworth starring as Thor and Tom Hiddleston reprising his role as Loki.
