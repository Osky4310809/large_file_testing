And as she won the popular vote, she’s absolutely allowed to keep score. \nMany other politicians believed Trump’s ban was unconstitutional and take this ruling as a means for celebration. \nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Shumber (D-NY) said, \nPresident Trump ought to see the handwriting on the wall that his executive order is unconstitutional. He should abandon this proposal, roll up his sleeves and come up with a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe. \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said the ruling was “a victory for our Constitution and our fight against terrorism.” \nPelosi added, \nFor the sake of our values and the security of America, Democrats will continue to press for President Trump’s dangerous and unconstitutional ban to be withdrawn. Hillary Clinton's Great Legacy   \nWhile this is a huge victory for protesters of Trump’s unconstitutional ban and a nod to former Attorney General Sally Yates , who would not defend his bill and was fired by Trump, there is still more to do. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:29:30.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
