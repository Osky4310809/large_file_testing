Joe Saunders January 13, 2017 at 3:02pm Advertisement - story continues below \nThis is a ruling conservatives can respect. \nFox News commentator Judge Jeanine Pirro has made a broadcasting career hurling words at Democrat politicians and liberals foolish enough to cross swords with her on public issues, but when it came to news that an inspector general has launched an investigation into FBI director, she only needed one. \nAnd it was dead on. Advertisement - story continues below Related Stories \nIn an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Friday, Pirro summed up what’s clearly a last-ditch strategy to smear the election of Donald Trump with a perfect description of the endeavor. \n“Nonsense.” \n“The inspector general now looking at James Comey, you know, it’s part of this continuing, ‘oh, there’s a reason Hillary lost. Not because she’s a horrible candidate not because she put our secrets at risk on this private server, but because of James Comey,’” Pirro said. “And it’s just nonsense.” Advertisement - story continues below \nCheck out the interview here. \nNews of an investigation by Obama Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz into Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email case broke Thursday in a story by The New York Times. \nThe paper reported that the decision not to prosecute Clinton was not at issue (naturally) but how Comey criticized the former secretary of state in announcing that decision was (he branded her “extremely careless” with national security.)

She’s the one who met with the target’s husband, secretly, hoping that no one would find out about it. And instead they’re going after Comey.” \nIt’s worth noting here that Pirro has been one of Comey’s strongest critics on the conservative end of American politics. In July, she blasted him for his announcement that he would not recommend prosecuting Clinton, In October she blasted him again for reopening the case. \nSo, her description of the latest development as “nonsense” should carry weight across the conservative spectrum. \nIt’s not clear what the goal of an investigation even is at this point. \nIn a week, Donald Trump is going to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, no matter how hard Democrats and their allies in the mainstream media tried to swing the general election. \nThe point here is that Pirro summed it up perfectly. \nWith every hour that passes, the election of 2016 moves further into the nation’s past, no matter how much Democrats are whining about it. And if any one person in the federal government operated questionably, it wasn’t James Comey and his nationally televised announcements, or open letters to the elected representatives of the American people. \nIt was Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the Barack Obama appointee, and her would-be secret meeting with a former president in a deserted part of an Arizona airport. \nAnd the investigation into Comey is likely to turn up exactly what Pirro called it on Friday morning: \nNonsense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T05:35:57.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
