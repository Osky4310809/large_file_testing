The latest of them come from popular accessory brand UAG. \nUAG has listed a bunch of Galaxy S8 cases on its website, revealing some design elements of the smartphone in high-resolution imagery. There seems to be a front-facing camera, an iris scanner, and four other sensors above the display and Samsung branding below the screen. Similar to various leaks and renders of the Galaxy S8 over the past few weeks, there doesn’t seem to be a physical home button or capacitive navigation keys. \nThe fingerprint scanner seems to be placed beside the camera sensor. Apart from the power button and volume keys, these case images also show an additional physical button on the side of the Galaxy S8. The extra button is said to be dedicated for Samsung’s upcoming Bixby AI-powered virtual voice assistant. \nThere is no guarantee that case makers are showing off the actual product here, so there is still no telling what the final version of the Galaxy S8 will look like. What do make of the images below? Let us know in the comments!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:28:19.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
