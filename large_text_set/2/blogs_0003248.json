Obviously, Manning was engaging in some light trolling — if Mark Wahlberg’s love of all things Boston-adjacent wasn’t clear enough from his career, Manning might have taken a cue from the Patriots hat he had on for the interview.\nAdmirably, Wahlberg refused to take to the bait, simply fixing Manning with a blank stare. It’s important to remember not to feed the trolls, whether online or offline, and Wahlberg’s provided us all with a very good example.\nNext time, though, we’d like to see him answer in-character as his foul-mouthed, belligerent Detective Sergeant Dignam from The Departed. That’ll make for a good interview.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:54:57.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
