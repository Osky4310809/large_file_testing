After the wedding, she took it to Kleen Cleaners in Edinburgh. When the dry cleaning shop went out of business, it was reported that the dress had been lost or stolen .\n“I have just found out that the dry cleaners have lost my much loved wedding dress,” she wrote in a Facebook post , “It was made by my Great Great Granny in 1870 (I altered the top) and I wore it in June 2016. Kleen Cleaners in Edinburgh used to be the best but recently fell into crooked hands and have gone into liquidation,” she said. “It seems that the dress was taken to be sold so it could be winging its way anywhere.” \nThe public Facebook post went viral, with more than 301,000 shares. Thanks to the post, the landlord who owned the building that had once housed the shop decided to poke around. \nWhile searching the premises, he came across a “ crumpled heap of antique lace on the floor ,” which was, in fact, the missing dress.\nSometimes the internet can accomplish truly amazing things.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:25:46.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
