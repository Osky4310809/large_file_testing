Have something you want discussed? . This week’s topic: What kinds of buildings do you want to see in Detroit? This week, we finally got an idea of what the Hudson’s site will (probably) look like in a few years. We’ve waited a long time for this, and the reactions to the future tallest building in Detroit were a mix of “WOWOWOWOW” and “Come on Dan, go taller!” Whatever you think of the proposed design, it’s going to make a significant impact in the skyline, and we haven’t been able to say that in a while. For today’s open thread, let’s put on our urban planner hats, our architect hats, our developer hats. If you were going to propose a show-stopping building in Detroit, what would it look like? Would it be supertall, like New York or Chicago? Would it have an ultra modern design? What would it be used for? Offices, condos, a museum or destination? Would it be right downtown, or somewhere else? Tell us your best ideas and designs. We’re fantasizing, so you don’t even need tax incentives here! Let us know what you think in the comments, and maybe, just maybe, a developer is out there listening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:59:22.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
