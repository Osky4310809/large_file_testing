It is often hard to understand the difference between erratic behaviour and a mental illness, and anxiety is one such complex condition that requires patience and understanding. People with anxiety are functional, have jobs, and, yes, have relationships as well. So, if you are dating someone who has anxiety, other than reading up on it, you need to keep these things in mind: They need structure . Routine and predictability are the cornerstones that help them maintain a sense of control over their lives, which they feel they lack. They need reassurance . They will doubt themselves, and, sometimes, your love for them. It comes from the deep-seated fear that they have that something is not right. Be patient with them, and reassure them when they need it. Relaxing is challenging. It’s not that they don’t want to. It’s just that it is difficult for them to switch off their mind, which races at the speed of light, and just be. They need to sometimes emotionally check out. It’s nothing personal. It’s just that sometimes they get overwhelmed by all the noise in their head, and just need to switch off from everything. Understand this, and give them the space that they need. It will only help your relationship. They will sometimes say things they don’t mean. Just like anger, anxiety can also sometimes overpower us, and make us say things we don’t mean. If they say or do something in a moment of heat, take time out and address it later, when they are feeling calm. You can’t always help them. This is perhaps the most difficult feeling to sit with, but you have to. Sometimes, you will have to just let them be. Yes, it will be painful to watch them suffer from their thoughts, and you will want to do something - anything - to make it better for them. But, you can’t. The best thing you can do is to just be beside them. Most importantly, they don’t need advice or sympathy . Sometimes, these come from a place of meaning well. But, you are better off keeping quiet than offering advice. Chances are, they’ve already tried whatever it is that you have to suggest. You will only remind them of their failure, and put yourself in a spot of helplessness. Sympathy never helps anybody. It only makes the person feel worst. So, keep that under check as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:44:05.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
