I don’t think it’s worked out terribly well. I think we’ve moved on beyond it. It’s like, okay, we’ve got it, we’ve got the whole Freudian biomechanoid meme. I’ve seen it in 100 horror films since…But is there any validity to doing another one now? I don’t know. Maybe,” he told THR .\nJames made sure to say that he is a huge fan of Ridley and is interested in seeing what happens with the film.\nAlien: Covenant is set to hit theaters on May 19th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:54:10.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
