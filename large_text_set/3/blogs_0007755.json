He writes stuff on Twitter according to his whims and fancies and then writes some more to apologise for the same. It has become a ritual for him. He prides on writing strong words against people without giving any thought to the matter and when people start trolling him, he takes a step back and apologises. After Tiger Shroff on his birthday, he targeted Women’s Day and Sunny Leone. He had tweeted, “I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives.” That’s it! And the man got trolled heavily on Twitter. Many threats by NCP and a Police complaint on him by an activist in Goa later, the filmmaker has apologised but with a disclaimer. (Also read: Sonam Kapoor DISSES Ram Gopal Varma for his comment on Tiger Shroff ) \nRam Gopal Varma tweeted saying, “Was just expressing my feelings but I apologise to all who were offended due to my unintended insensitive tweets in context of women’s day.” He further added, “My apology is only to those who genuinely got offended and not to those who ranted for publicity nd threatened to take law into their hands.” So it isn’t an apology for all but a select few. Before he said sorry, he had even justified his tweet on Sunny on Women’s day. He had said, “The negative noise towards my tweet on @SunnyLeone arises from ultimate hypocrisy.She has more honesty and more self respect than any woman.” Check out his apology tweet right here. \nRam Gopal Varma is a regular offender. Tiger Shroff recently celebrated his birthday and while everyone from his fans to the people in the film industry were busy showering him with wishes, the Sarkar 3 director decided to rant. Rather than wishing him, he trolled the young actor for posing in a picture which according to him was like a homosexual. It was a still from Baaghi where the actor is seen walking out of the sea. He had written, “@iTIGERSHROFF If you believe me ask @bindasbhidu who also is a huge Bruce Lee fan like me…only gays pose like that not MEN.” He also added in his next tweet, how Tiger should learn machismo from his father Jackie Shroff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T09:02:01.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
