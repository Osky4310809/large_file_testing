They will be targeted,\" says Mr Shams, an Iraqi Kurd. \"This really is a matter of life or death.\" \nMr Shams has been told that travelling to Iraq will invalidate his permanent residence status, but \"I'm not going to leave my wife or my family behind\", he says. \"Even if I have to risk my life, I have to go back.\" \"I risked my life for the sake of the United States of America and my colleagues there. They brought me back here and I am grateful for that. But my feelings today are that you can't keep taking from me and not give anything back.\" -Iraqi soldier \nOne Iraqi soldier now working for the military in the US, says his parents — who have immigration visas but are waiting for their green cards — are now in limbo. \nHis had planned to shuttle to and from Iraq, where they have a relative who has suffered a stroke, but now fear their re-entry would be blocked. The soldier also fears that his brother and sister's asylum applications will fail. \n\"I risked my life for the sake of the United States of America and my colleagues there. They brought me back here and I am grateful for that,\" he says. \"But my feelings today are that you can't keep taking from me and not give anything back.\" \nThe abrupt executive order has also left immigrants and foreign US residents stranded at airports around the world. \nIbrahim Dujaili, an Iraqi with Belgian citizenship, spent €4,000 trying to secure passage for his family to visit his ill mother-in-law in the US. \nWhen they tried to board a flight from London to Dallas , an official told them that Iraqis were banned, including their two children who only carry Belgian nationality. \nSocial media has hummed with similar stories of people being hauled off planes or being prevented returning to the US while in transit. \nAt Dubai airport, Emirates Airline says it was helping a small number of stranded passengers to secure refunds or passage to other countries. \nCritics claim that hundreds of thousands of people in the regional commercial centre of the United Arab Emirates could be affected by the travel ban, disrupting business operations. \nIranians could also be hit hard by the measures. There are an estimated 1m Iranian-Americans, many of whom left their home country after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but kept strong bonds with family in their country of birth. \nTo protest against the ban, film star Taraneh Alidoosti announced she would boycott the Oscars in Los Angeles on February 26, where the Iranian film Salesman is nominated for the academy's best foreign film award. \nThe ban particularly affects Iranian students in the US who cannot risk leaving to visit their families. \n\"If I'm allowed to continue my education, it means my family can no longer come and see me and I don't dare to go home and see them,\" said Nazi, 23, a student studying music in Virginia. \n\"The ban means I will miss my only sister's wedding. It's so depressing.\" \nBy Erika Solomon in Beirut, Najmeh Bozorgmehr in Tehran and Simeon Kerr in Dubai", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T19:47:16.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
