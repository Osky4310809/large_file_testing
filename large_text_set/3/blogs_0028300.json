The then-eighth-grade student’s pressurized air gun was capable of launching marshmallows up to 175 feet—over half a football field. \nObama was so awed by the marshmallow cannon that he decided had to experience the thrill of shooting it himself. \nIn the years that followed, Hudy became something of a minor academic celebrity. He visited foreign countries to advocate for the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. ( You can see a chronicle of his travels on this blog , last updated in 2016). \nA website called Brilliant.com hailed Hudy as officially being among the “10 Smartest Kids In The World.” \nThings took a turn for the worse, however. \nIn January 2017, doctors diagnosed Hudy with schizophrenia. \n“He started taking about the Chinese government following him,” Victor Hudy, Joe’s father, told Phoenix Fox affiliate KSAZ-TV this week. “He started getting a lot of paranoia and psychosis.” \nJoe Hudy was working in Hong Kong at the time. \n“He kept on saying his apartment was bugged,” Julie Hudy, Joe’s mother, told KSAZ-TV. “It was something I never dreamed of hearing.” \nThe mental issues Hudy had in Hong Kong led to a two-week stint in a psychiatric hospital. \nVictor and Julie Hudy were able to transport their son to the United States. He spent some time at a treatment facility in Cincinnati, Ohio. Doctors at the Ohio facility made the schizophrenia diagnosis. \nJoe Hudy has since checked into a psychiatric care facility in Tennessee. It is reportedly cheaper than the facility in Ohio, but it still costs $25,000 each month. \n“Anyone who knows my mother and father knows that they are some of the most generous and caring people you will ever meet,” Elizabeth Hudy writes. \n“My parents have done tremendous things to promote STEM education,” she also writes. \n“As their daughter, I only hope to be able to give as much support in return as I have always received from them. I am aware of the financial toll this has had on my family and I am hoping that you can help lessen the burden of this unforeseen financial hardship.” \nAdditional money raised will be donated to families with similar situations, Elizabeth Hudy has promised. \nAs of late Thursday afternoon, the GoFundMe page has raised just over $29,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T06:08:23.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
