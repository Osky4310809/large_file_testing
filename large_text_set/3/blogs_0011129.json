Not in a long shot. But with his spunky spirit and peppy attitude, Olly doesn’t need anything to affirm the fact that he’s a strong, independent little pup who don’t need no trophy.\nLet’s recap: Olly’s an energetic Jack Russell Terrier who was super jazzed to perform on the obstacle course during the 2017 Crufts dog show in Birmingham, U.K. So jazzed, in fact, that he just couldn’t contain himself on said course. And like an unattended child who’s been given a few shots of espresso , there was no containing his rocket fuel-level energy, and that’s where disaster (hilariously) struck.\nCrufts / www.youtube.com Poor Olly, he just couldn’t focus on the course. Or contain himself. After zooming around the course, there was a total wipeout. Crufts / www.youtube.com Then, there was a belly flop. Crufts / www.youtube.com At one point, he went totally airborne. Crufts / www.youtube.com Look at him go! But all in all, Olly had a great spirit. Obstacle course or no obstacle course, there was nothing getting in the way of his good time. And after trying to head off the course early once or twice, he totally recovered like a champ and finished his agility task.\nBut don’t take our word for it. You’ve got to watch this for yourselves, people. \n\nOh well, Olly, at least you still won something: our hearts.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:20:56.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
