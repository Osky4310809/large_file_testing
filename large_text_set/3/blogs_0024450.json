Could   \nEven though it's all for charity, we bet Piers Morgan is filled with a little bit of regret right now. \nLet's bring you up to speed. Yesterday the diehard Arsenal fan agreed to wear a Spurs shirt on one condition - that £50,000 must be raised for Comic Relief on Piers' donation page by 8am on Red Nose Day. \nIt all started when Morgan initially made a pledge to come off Twitter for 24 hours if £5,000 was raised. However, Lord Alan Sugar donated the sum within minutes in order to \"shut up\" Piers. \nSince that target was met, Piers decided to up the ante. The GMB presenter said: \"A little earlier I said I would come off Twitter for a day for Comic Relief if we raised £5,000. \n\"Within about seven minutes Lord Sugar, hovering in Florida, had posted a video to say he’d pay the whole thing to shut me up. \n\"So we then reset and I, in a reckless moment, said I would wear a Tottenham Hotspur shirt, which if you know my football allegiance is the nearest thing to hell imaginable, if viewers raised £50,000.\" (Photo: Good Morning Britain/ITV) \nUpon hearing the news, the likes of Gary Lineker, Robbie Savage, Rio Ferdinand, Kevin Pietersen, Holly Willoughby, Bradley Walsh, Jamie Redknapp and Michael Vaughan all confirmed they would donate £1,000 for the cause. \nBut Lord Sugar's recruitment drive has continued apace since - and it just got serious. \nHe made Spurs' star striker Harry Kane aware of the bet: \nAnd the England man was happy to get involved - saying he'll contribute to the fund... and DOUBLE his donation if Morgan smooches the Tottenham badge. \nAt the time of writing, donations stand at a tad under £17,000 - but it's likely this'll now shoot up with donations from amused Spurs fans and the Gooners who can't stand his #WengerOut complaints. So... nervous yet, Piers? Who would do a better job as Arsenal manager? 5000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:30:26.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
