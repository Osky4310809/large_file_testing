John Lewis (D-GA) and his “crime infested” district in Georgia, which includes parts of Atlanta. Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to…… \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk – no action or results. Sad! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 \nLewis, 76, who was born in Alabama and marched in 1965 from Selma to Montgomery to help usher in the Voting Rights Act, delivered this week an impassioned 760-word testimony against the confirmation of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as US Attorney General. \nIt was the type of speech only someone who lived through segregation in the deep south, stood up to the violence of institutional racism, and spent a lifetime fighting for the civil rights of African-Americans could deliver. \nLater, Lewis told NBC News’ Meet the Press he won’t be attending Trump’s inauguration next week and said he does not believe Trump is a “legitimate president.” \n“I don’t plan to attend the inauguration. It will be the first one that I miss since I’ve been in Congress. You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right,” Lewis said . \nTrump took offense to Lewis’ criticism, responding with a message that essentially overlooks the congressman’s lifetime of service to the country and particularly its people of color. \nLewis, born in 1940 to sharecroppers and who by the age of 23 was referred to as one of the “ Big Six leaders of the Civil Rights Movement ,” now represents Georgia’s mostly African-American 5th District, where more than 87 percent of adults are high school graduates. \nAt least six Democrats, including Lewis, have said they will boycott Trump’s inauguration next Friday, including Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-IL), Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA), Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ), and Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA).
