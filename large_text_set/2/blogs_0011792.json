On January 11, a Nathan Redmond goal beat Liverpool at St Mary's... (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) ...and it was the same result at Anfield in the semi's second leg, with Shane Long scoring (Photo: AFP/Getty) \n\"We are not used to being a top team. \"Maybe we have to be, but we are not used to being... we are not clever like Chelsea who will be 2-0 up and just finish a game, say (to their opponents) 'Now come and try something!'\" he explained. \n\"Did I learn anything new about them in the last few weeks? Yes. A lot of what I wanted to learn? No. But that is how it is. I am not one bit in doubt about the character of these players but of course we have to create mentality.\" \nFor Klopp, the extraordinary momentum of collapse was a combination of things, with the inability to grind results out as Chelsea have done for much of the season a key factor. \nHe has a frighteningly young side that he is building for the future, with the project viewed in terms of years, not just this season. Liverpool are recharging for the run-in at Spain's La Manga resort (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty) \nThe German says it was the toll taken by a fixture list which saw Liverpool play 13 matches in just 33 days over Christmas and the early weeks of the New Year that his inexperienced squad found most difficult to cope with. \nAnd he even hinted distractions such as runs into the later rounds of the EFL Cup are possibly better avoided. \nAsked what he learnt from such a difficult period, he replied with a smile: \"December-January, (the fixtures) make it difficult. In December, we missed players and did not have the best schedule. It feels worse because of different cup competitions. Last Saturday's win over Spurs brought a miserable run to an end for the Reds (Photo: AFP/Getty) \n\"We should have been out of the EFL Cup last year, and that would have meant two less defeats this year [both legs of the semi-final against Southampton] in a moment when we needed each second for bringing a player back from injury, for recovery, for training, all that stuff. \n\"It didn't help, but that's how it is. \n\"Chelsea were able to play the same team all the time. They left the EFL Cup when? Before it started? I don't remember them playing one game in that competition [Chelsea went out at the last-16 stage]. \n\"Get rid of this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:45:56.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
