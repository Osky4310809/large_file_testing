We have no problem there.” \n“For the previous president, I was evil. The crazy man was planning to jail me,” he added. “This other one (Trump), he said, ‘You’re right.'” \nFilipino media outlet Rappler reported that Duterte told the crowd that he was prepared to “give all, whatever it is,” to strengthen the ties between the Philippines and the U.S., but stopped short of agreeing to an expanded military alliance between the two nations, saying,”I don’t like military alliances. We can’t handle those.”   \nDuterte made clear that his nation simply couldn’t afford to expand its military at the current time and had no wishes to become involved in any military conflicts, though he did leave the door open to doing so at a later date: “Someday, but not now.” \nDuterte’s labeling of Obama as a “crazy man” should come as no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention, as the notoriously foul-mouthed president of the Philippines — who took office in June 2016 — has repeatedly referred to Obama as a “son of a whore” and told him to “go to hell” on more than one occasion. \nTo be sure, while Duterte claimed he and Trump were on good terms and that Trump had told him “you’re right” regarding his war on drugs, it is doubtful that Trump actually supports and advocates the extreme measures Duterte has taken in that battle, most likely only agreeing with the principle of holding nothing back in the fight against those who push and profit from deadly drugs. \nIn that, Trump and Obama are worlds apart, and that is something that every foreign leader can plainly see, whether they like it or not.
