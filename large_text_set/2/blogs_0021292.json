STAR/Edd Gumban, File photo \nSHARIFF AGUAK, Philippines ( Philippines News Agency ) - Police arrested here Friday two persons believed to be involved in the infamous Mamasapano carnage in 2015, police said Saturday. \nThe Criminal Investigation and Detection Group in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (CIDG-ARMM), in a report, identified the suspects as Lakiman Kalid Dawaling and Mustapha Tatak who were apprehended at 10 a.m. Friday. \nArmed with arrest warrants, CIDG-ARMM operatives backed by personnel of the Maguindanao police and 1st Mechanized Battalion went to the safehouse of the two suspects in Barangay Poblacion. \nThey are facing multiple murder charges in connection with the deadly Mamasapano massacre of 44 members of an elite police force out to arrest the country's most wanted terrorist, Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir alias Marwan. \nThe two were members of the outlawed Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), a ragtag group of gunmen who were former members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). \nAt least 67 individuals, including 44 policemen, 18 Moro fighters and five civilians, were killed when the police unit launched Oplan Exodus aimed at arresting Marwan, who was hiding in the marshland of Mamasapano, Maguindanao. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nThe assault led to a day-long firefight that shocked the nation. \nMarwan, a suspect in the 2002 Bali bombing in Indonesia, carried a US$5 million bounty put up by the United States for his alleged involvement in various bombings in Mindanao and in Southeast Asia. \nHe was known to have trained Moro bandits in bombing making and terror attacks. His Filipino lieutenant, Ahmad Akmad Usman, alias Basit Usman, escaped during the police operation. \nHe was later killed by MILF forces in Talayan, Maguindanao. \nThe CIDG said the two suspects, who denied the charges and are currently detained at the Maguindanao PNP provincial office, will be sent to Camp Bagong Diwa to face the charges against them.
