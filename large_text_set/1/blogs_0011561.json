including paintings by renaissance master Caravaggio, rococo painter Fragonard and post-impressionist artist Bonnard - and a gigantic ranch in Kenya that was used in the filming of Sydney Pollack's 1985 movie Out of Africa . \nAfter their father's death in 2001, Guy and his brother Alec declared they were worth just 40.9 million euros for inheritance tax purposes, paying the bill in bas-reliefs sculpted for Louis XVI's wife, Marie-Antoinette. \nWhen Alec died in 2008, Guy declared an inheritance of less than 60 million euros. \nThe prosecution called for a four-year suspended sentence and 250-million-euro fine for Guy Wildenstein, one year suspended for Stoupakova and six months suspended for Alec Junior. \nNone of them appeared in court. \nProsecutors also wanted a two-year suspended sentence for notary Robert Panhard, two years in jail and one suspended with a million-euro fine for Swiss lawyer Peter Altorfer and two years suspended for French lawyer Olivier Riffaud. \nAnd they called for two trusts - one based in the Bahamas, the other in Guernsey - to be fined the maximum possible for complicity in tax fraud, 187,500 euros each. \nIntention not enough for conviction \nBut the law has to apply equally to \"the powerful and the poor\", Géron said, and knowing that the family intentionally hid its wealth was not a sufficient legal basis to find them guilty. \nHe said he was \"astonished\" that French MPs had not passed laws to clarify the status of trusts until 2011, although they have been under the spotlight for over a century. \nThat law could not be applied to this case since it referred to events that took place before it had been passed. \nGéron also criticised investigators, claiming they had failed to carry out sufficient research in the tax havens to establish that the trusts were \"fictional\" and that the Wildensteins had secretly maintained access to and control of their fortune. \nAfter the verdict Guy Wildenstein's lawyer, Hervé Témine, said his client was \"very relieved\" while expressing concern it might give rise to controversy over \"justice for the rich\". \nWidows, ex-wives and lawsuits \nThe first signs of trouble for the Wildenstein's came in 2005 when Daniel's second wife, Sylvia Roth-Wildenstein, sued Guy and Alec, accusing them of hiding the true extent of the family's wealth when her husband died. \nIn 2011 Stoupakova filed suit for breach of trust, claiming that she had been deprived of her fair share of the inheritance. \nThere were further legal worries in the US in the same year when prosecutors opened an investigation into suspicions of receiving stolen goods and breach of trust against Guy Wildenstein, seizing several paintings, including one by impressionist Berthe Morisot valued at 800,000 euros. \nNew tax case pending \nThe case has been an embarrassment for former president Nicolas Sarkozy, who made Guy Wildenstein, a member of his party's US branch, a commnader of the Legion of Honour in 2009, describing him as a \"friend\". \nThursday's acquittal will not be the end of the Wildensteins' legal difficulties.The French fiscal authorities are pursuing them for 550 million euros in allegedly unpaid taxes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T15:49:36.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
