The same is true for communications between doctors and the labs and insurance companies with which they work. Carbon Health, a 1.5-year-old, San Francisco-based startup, is aiming to create a two-sided marketplace that makes it easier for everyone involved to know what’s what. \nIts fully mobile platform — which aims to provide healthcare practices with greater transparency into and control of everything from scheduling, electronic health records, tele-health and billing — is already been using by a small number of outfits in the Bay Area, along with 750 of their patients. \nAccording to founder and CEO Eren Bali, those patients love it, too. The reason: by connecting healthcare practices with clinics, insurance companies, pharmacies, labs and medical imaging centers, patients are empowered by the platform, too. Specifically, Bali says, using the service, they can schedule appointments, make payments, fill prescriptions, and (crucially) access their medical records, all on their mobile devices. “Instead of health record system where patients records are stored on the provider side, we flipped the system,” says Bali. \nIn fact, it’s because of the early traction that Carbon Health is seeing that it says it was able to convince investors to provide it with $6.5 million in seed funding over two tranches. Chicago-based BuildersVC is its biggest investor to date; others of its backers include Javelin Venture Partners, Two Sigma Ventures, Bullpen Capital and a long string of well-known angel investors, including serial entrepreneurs Aaron Patzer, Elad Gil and Russ Fradin. \nInvestors apparently like the company’s revenue model, too. Most physicians use a billing company and pay 5 to 10 percent of their collections to that service. Carbon Health aims to replace that cost, charging 7 percent for not only billing but a variety of other services that healthcare practices typically pay for separately, including HR and practice management. Bali’s background can’t hurt, either. As some readers may already know, Bali previously cofounded and served as CEO of the well-funded education marketplace Udemy . If, as an investor, you’re betting on a new marketplace, you could do worse than place your chips on someone who knows a thing or two about these two-sided businesses. \nCarbon Health had launched at the TechCrunch Disrupt show in San Francisco last fall.
