Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown rolled up to the Golden Globes looking amazing in a sparkly silver dress, which fell just below the knee. \nThe breakout star of the show confirmed recently that she would be appearing in the second season, and we’re so thrilled to see Eleven once again. Brown gave her iconic character a shout-out on the red carpet this evening, making the number eleven with her fingers. Ugh we love her so much. \nCheck out the pic below: \nVenturelli/WireImage With Stranger Things nominated for Best Television Series — Drama , and Winona Ryder being nominated for Best Actress in a Drama, we knew the cast would turn out in full swing, looking absolutely stunning . \nThe boys of Stranger Things: Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, and Gaten Matarazzo looked dapper on the red carpet. \nSteve Granitz/WireImage The foursome remained mum on the topic of Season 2 and what’s to come for the people of Hawkins, Indiana. WE JUST NEED ONE SPOILER!! Seriously though, all the kids of Stranger Things look fantastic and we’re absolutely sure that they’re going to be some of the most sought-out people in the Beverly Hilton tonight. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T03:30:59.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
