His first half of football has just been magnificent,” Johnson told Fox Footy at half-time. \n“He’s taken defensive marks, he’s been sharp around the contest and he’s done a couple of handballs that have set his teammates off and running.” \nWhile his health was — and will always be — the top priority, Roughead’s absence from the Hawks last year somewhat went undersold from an on-field perspective. \nAccording to Champion Data’s 2017 AFL Prospectus , Roughead was Hawthorn’s barometer in its premiership season of 2015, averaging 25 more ranking points in wins compared to losses. Not only did he provide a great target to kick to inside forward 50, his ability at ground level was just as important, while he also ran through the midfield to pick up ample disposals and apply much needed pressure. \nAs The Prospectus points out, Roughead is Hawthorn’s “heart and soul”, both on and off the field. media_camera Patrick Dangerfield was quick to congratulate Jarryd Roughead on his return. \nAnd the big man certainly asserted his authority throughout Friday night’s game against Geelong. \n“He’s so good with the footy in hand because he thinks his way through with real clarity. He’s a midfielder now, but he’s so big and powerful,” Hawks champion Dermott Brereton said. \nAs impressive as he was, Roughead as just glad to be playing footy again. \n“It was great to have a run around again,” he told Fox Footy post-game. \n“I was alright early, but towards the end I ran out of petrol tickets — as you do in a game, you get a bit tired. \n“It’s still building. This is a small step and Round 1’s obviously the big goal.” \nPerhaps the only downside of Roughead’s night came before the first bounce when he lost his first coin toss. \n“That was the first time we had a crack at flipping a coin — and I lost,” Roughead laughed. \n“But that’s alright and we’ll get better as the year goes on.” \nNot only should his coin toss calls improve, so too should his output. \nWelcome back, Rough. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.
