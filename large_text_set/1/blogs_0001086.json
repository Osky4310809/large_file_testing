His name was not made public. He in critical condition at Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore.\nA police statement said “it is unclear if he had any connection to the victims.”\nPolice identified the 16-year-old as Charlotte Zaremba, a student at Howard High School, and her mother as Suzanne Zaremba, 52. The mother was treated and released from Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore.\nThe shooting happened at about 2 a.m. in a home in the 4800 block of Knoll Glen Road in Ellicott City, about midway between Baltimore and Washington. Police said another family member was home at the time of the shooting, but was in another part of the house and was not hurt.\nHoward County police said in a statement that the mother heard a scuffle in her daughter’s bedroom and walked inside. Police said the suspected gunman “fired a shot at her, and then the girl, and then himself.” Police said they knew of no motive.\nRelatives did not respond to interview requests Sunday. John White, spokesman for the Howard County school system, said counselors would be sent to Howard High, about two miles from the victims’ house, to help students and teachers. He said that as of late Sunday afternoon, the principal had not talked with the girl’s mother and thus would not discuss the victim.\nMore than 50 people commented on the Howard County Police Department’s Facebook posting describing the crime, including friends of both the slain teen and her mother.\nSeveral people identifying themselves as her former teachers also posted to the site, one saying: “She was one of my sweetest students. She will be greatly, greatly missed in our class. My thoughts and prayers are with her family.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@phscoop"], "published": "2017-01-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:13:14.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
