Well, worry not for there’s still hope that the episode will soon be aired! You heard that right, Indianexpress.com has reported that the news of Kapil’s episode being dropped is false and that it’ll definitely be out soon. The source was quoted saying, “This (the episode getting dropped) is not at all happening. The show is, in fact, ending with Kapil’s episode. The promo will be out tomorrow, and the episode will air on March 5.” Ah, isn’t that a relief to hear?

Similarly, the comedian was upset with the filmmaker for asking rather personal questions in the episode of Koffee. A source told DNA, “Karan asked him how come he took to Twitter so early in the morning? Didn’t he have a girlfriend with whom he could spend the time instead? Kapil was embarrassed and didn’t know what to say. He told Karan he is not comfortable answering such questions. He also commented that he himself never asks such things to his guests when they come on his show. Also, since Kapil is not very fluent in English, he would have been fearing how it would be interpreted.” \nDamn, too much drama no?
