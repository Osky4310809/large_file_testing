Yui Mok/PA \nA group led by MPs in memory of Jo Cox will be handing out “happy to chat” badges on the Tube tomorrow in a bid to tackle loneliness. \nThe former MP for Batley and Spen had started to set up a cross-party commission on loneliness before she was murdered in June last year. \nIn her memory campaigners and politicians rallied together to continue the work of the commission, which aims to combat the “silent epidemic” of loneliness. \nOn Tuesday the commission will be distributing specially-made badges reading “happy to chat” at some of London’s busiest Tube stations. Happy to chat: The badges will be handed out across London on Tuesday morning. (Jo Cox Loneliness) \nThe pin badges will be given to Underground passengers at rush hour between 7.30am and 9am at Victoria, Waterloo, King’s Cross and Westminster, Time Out reported. \nThe idea has been backed by 13 organisations including Age UK, Alzheimer’s Society and Refugee Action. \nRachel Reeves, one of the MPs leading the commission. (Glenn Copus) \nMPs Rachel Reeves and Seema Kennedy, co-chairs of the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness, said in a statement: “Now is the time to break that silence by starting a conversation. \n“We need a national conversation about the scale and impact of the problem. But just as importantly, every single one of us can start a conversation with somebody that will help break the cycle of silent suffering and unintentional neglect.” — Jo Cox Loneliness (@JoCoxLoneliness) January 30, 2017 \nIn September last year a member of the public arranged for hundreds of badges reading \"Tube chat?\" to be handed out across the capital, prompting a backlash by some who responded with \"shut up!\" badges .
