The Clarity Fuel Cell is one of these, the vehicle being introduced as part of the Europe-wide HyFIVE (Hydrogen For Innovative Vehicles) initiative to drive the adoption of fuel cell vehicles and the creation of a viable hydrogen refuelling infrastructure across the region. \nGALLERY: Honda Clarity Fuel Cell Research Honda Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:28:45.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
