We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC \n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 \nThe hashtag stands for Jewish community centers, which responded to 11 bomb threats on Monday, The New York Times reported , the latest in a string of such threats and a marked rise in anti-Semitic sentiments in the country. 54 centers in the U.S. and Canada have received 69 threats since January, according to David Posner , the director of strategic performance of the JCC Association of North America. \nAlthough the White House released a statement condemning the threats, which forced evacuations at several centers, the administration again came under fire for not mentioning by name the people most affected: namely, Jews. “Hatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom. The President has made it abundantly clear that these actions are unacceptable,” White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement to press. The White House’s bizarrely non-specific statement called back to the days-long dust-up over the administration’s Holocaust Remembrance Day remarks , which managed to omit any mention of the Nazis’ six million Jewish victims.
