(Photo: Getty Images) \nWASHINGTON — Amid continuing tensions with President Trump, Sen. John McCain on Wednesday announced he will oppose the confirmation of Rep. Mick Mulvaney as director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget. \nThough McCain, R-Ariz., and Trump and feuded on and off for months — and have sparred on Twitter as recently as Wednesday morning — McCain has up to now supported all of Trump's nominees who have come up for Senate confirmation votes. \nMcCain's opposition to Mulvaney, R-S.C., largely stems from Mulvaney's past support of cuts to defense spending, particularly his 2011 vote to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan and 2013 amendment to trim $3.5 billion from a defense appropriations bill, as well as Mulvaney's contribution to what McCain characterized as Capitol Hill's \"dysfunction.\" In the House, Mulvaney was among the conservative Republicans who supported shutting down the government as a tactic in spending fights. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Donald Trump and John McCain have been sparring publicly from the beginning of Trump's campaign for presidency, which began in June 2015. Here are the highlights. The Republic Fullscreen June 30, 2015: Two weeks after Trump announced his presidential candidacy in a speech widely criticized for calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and drug runners, McCain put distance between himself and the celebrity billionaire. \"I just disagree with his comments about the, quote, Mexicans,\" McCain said. Mark Henle/The Republic Fullscreen July 10, 2015: The Republic published a story with the headline \"McCain, Flake want no part of Trump's Phoenix rally.\" Trump campaign sources subsequently confirmed that Trump himself was aware of the article, which quoted McCain speaking about Trump's comments about Mexicans on MSNBC. \"I just think that it is offensive to not only Hispanic citizenry, but other citizenry, but he's entitled to say what he wants to say,\" McCain said. Charlie Leight/The Republic Fullscreen July 11, 2015: Trump appeared at a rally at the Phoenix Convention Center. \"We have incompetent politicians, not only the president,\" Trump told the crowd. \"I mean, right here, in your own state, you have John McCain.\" The pro-Trump audience booed the mention of McCain's name. After the event, Trump hammered McCain some more. \"I've supported John McCain, but he's very weak on immigration,\" Trump said. \"... If the right person runs against John McCain, he will lose.\" Cheryl Evans/The Republic Fullscreen July 16, 2015: The New Yorker published McCain's reaction to Trump's Arizona rally. “This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,” McCain said in the interview. “Because what he did was he fired up the crazies.” Trump immediately fired back on Twitter, demanding that McCain apologize for the \"crazies\" remark and calling McCain a \"dummy\" for graduating last in his class at the U.S. Naval Academy. Jack Gruber/USA TODAY Fullscreen July 18, 2015: The feud really exploded when Trump, at an event in Iowa, disparaged McCain's service during the Vietnam War. Trump, who did not serve in Vietnam, said McCain was “a war hero because he was captured” and that he liked “people that weren’t captured.” McCain is a former Navy aviator who was shot down in 1967 and held as a P.O.W. for more than five years. Jack Gruber/USA TODAY Fullscreen Aug. 10, 2015: McCain, who had been trying to keep out of a running feud with Trump, criticized Trump over comments about Fox News personality Megyn Kelly. McCain denounced Trump's comments, which were widely derided as sexist, as offensive. McCain also defended his record on veterans' issues from Trump's attacks. Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY March 1, 2016: Trump won big on Super Tuesday, making his march toward the Republican presidential nomination all but unstoppable. Pressure started to build on McCain, who had been saying he would support whoever the GOP's standard-bearer was, even Trump. Pat McDonogh/Courier-Journal Fullscreen March 3, 2016: McCain joined Mitt Romney in beating up Trump. McCain focused on foreign policy. At the time, McCain aides pointed out that he'd also taken Trump to task over Trump's attitude toward Muslims, Trump's support for torture, and Trump's approving remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tom Tingle/The Republic April 19, 2016: McCain announced he would not attend the Republican National Convention in July, where Trump would accept the party's nomination. Wong Maye/Associated Press Fullscreen May 5, 2016: Politico published audio leaked from a fundraiser in which McCain grimly tells supporters that Trump is hurting the GOP brand with Arizona's Latino electorate and that \"this may be the race of my life.\" But McCain subsequently told reporters he was sticking with Trump. Charlie Kaijo/The Republic Fullscreen May 11, 2016: Trump seemed to want to make peace with McCain, telling national radio personality Don Imus: \"You know, frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero. Also heroes are people that are, you know, whether they get caught or don’t get caught, they’re all heroes as far as I’m concerned. And that’s the way it should be.” Evan Vucci/Associated Press Fullscreen Aug. 1, 2016: McCain hit Trump over his attack on the parents of U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in action in Iraq in 2004. However, McCain did not withdraw his support of Trump. Trump quickly retaliated by saying he would not endorse McCain in his primary, resurrecting his accusation that McCain hadn't done a good job for veterans. Mark Wilson/Getty Images Fullscreen Aug. 5, 2016: Trump changed course and read a formal endorsement of McCain. \"I hold in the highest esteem Sen. John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office,\" Trump said. \"And I fully support and endorse his re-election.\" Cheryl Evans/The Republic Oct. 4, 2016: McCain stood up for Trump with regard to comments Trump made about soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder; McCain suggested the media left out the context and distorted Trump's meaning. Trump thanked McCain on Twitter. Mark Henle/The Republic Oct. 8, 2016: McCain finally pulled his support of Trump over the 2005 Trump sex-talk recording, joining many other Republicans in walking out on their party's nominee. Nick Oza/The Republic Fullscreen November 2016: Post-election, McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman signals that he will stand up to Trump as necessary: \"I am not a rubber stamp. There are maybe 100 Department of Defense positions that require Senate confirmation. I believe that the Constitution requires advice and consent (of the Senate).\" Getty Images Fullscreen Jan. 10, 2017: McCain feels the anger of Trump fans again after it is disclosed on Jan. 10 that he obtained and gave to the FBI a dossier of potentially compromising but unsubstantiated research on then-President-elect Donald Trump and alleged Russian ties. Saul Loeb/AFP Jan. 29, 2017: After McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham criticize his temporary refugee ban, Trump tweets that “should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.” Cincinnati Enquirer Fullscreen Feb. 9, 2017: Donald Trump took to Twitter again to attack McCain following the Arizona senator’s criticism of the White House’s characterizing of a raid in Yemen as as a “huge success,\" despite the death of a Navy SEAL. \"When you lose a $75 million airplane and, more importantly, an American life is lost and wounded I don't believe you can call it a success,” McCain said to NBC News.
