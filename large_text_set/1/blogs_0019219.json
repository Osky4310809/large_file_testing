Ariel Casilao said in a statement. ADVERTISEMENT \n“If it was done for the rights victims of martial law, it is possible for the victims of Mendiola Massacre, especially since it was carried out under the [administration of the late President Corazon Aquino], who promised that land reform was her centerpiece program,” Casilao said. \nThe victims were identified as Danilo Arjona, Leopoldo Alonzo, Adelfa Aribe, Dionisio Bautista, Roberto Caylao, Vicente Campomanes, Ronilo Dumunico, Dante Evangelio, Angelito Gutierrez, Rodrigo Grampan, Bernabe Laquindanum, Sonny Boy Perez and Roberto Yumul. \nThe Citizens’ Mendiola Commission, which was formed to investigate the incident, had recommended compensation for the dead and wounded. But the Supreme Court dismissed the petition for compensation in 1993. \n“The inescapable conclusion is that the state cannot be held civilly liable for the deaths that followed the incident,” the court said. \nNo one has been arrested, jailed or convicted for the killings, according to Antonio Flores, secretary-general of Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas. —TONETTE OREJAS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T01:31:31.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
