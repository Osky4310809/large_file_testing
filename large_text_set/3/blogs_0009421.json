The Portuguese manager also revealed the only response he got from UEFA when he voiced his worries was assurances that \"t he players are insured.\" The Times ' Paul Hirst relayed Mourinho's comments as he spoke ahead of United's clash in Russia on Thursday: \nIt is still hard for me to believe that we are going to play tomorrow in that field, if you can call it a field. I donâ€™t know which team to play. I was expecting something more playable. It's a very similar pitch to the one in Beijing [when the game was called off]. I told one gentleman from UEFA of my concerns. He just told me the players are insured, so what happens to them is no problem. Hirst also posted photographs of the playing surface: Paul Hirst @hirstclass 3/8/2017, 11:04:38 AM Mourinho added that he is unsure as to whether he should risk playing Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who has only just returned to the squad after injury, per Samuel Luckhurst in the Manchester Evening News . He did, though, reveal that Zlatan Ibrahimovoc will play against Rostov having picked up a three-match domestic ban after his altercation with Tyrone Mings in last weekend's disappointing 1-1 Premier League draw at Old Trafford, per the Press Association's Simon Peach: Simon Peach @SimonPeach 3/8/2017, 10:28:57 AM The two dropped points against the Cherries prevented United from, at least briefly, moving into the Premier League's top four. They remained in sixth place and their chances of qualifying for next season's UEFA Champions League become ever slimmer the longer they remain outside the top four places. The Red Devils' best chance of qualifying for Europe's top competition in 2017-18 could be to win the Europa League, a tournament for which they are the favourites. And, given United's superior quality and depth, they should have little problem seeing off Rostov over two legs to reach the last eight. However, the Russian Premier League outfit have caused upsets at home this season, most notably when they beat Bayern Munich 3-2 at the Olimp-2 back in November in the Champions League group stages. Mourinho is aware that the hosts will present United with a significant challenge on Thursday, per the Red Devils' Twitter feed: Manchester United @ManUtd \"They defend with 10 players and are very dangerous on the counter-attack,\" says Mourinho on FC Rostov. \"Their attacking players are good.\" https://t.co/BPejZmtWQ8 However, despite the pitch, if United play to their best they should return to Old Trafford with at least a draw, which would set them up well to advance after the home leg.
