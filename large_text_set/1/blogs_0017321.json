In some ways, that was pro but it was also a con. \n“The pro side is I was very free when I came to the game, I had no expectations, I took every day as it came. \n“... It was a very free journey of how good I could actually get over a long period of time as opposed to thinking it was my right to play for Australia, I never believed that.” \nAll-rounder Wilson played 11 Tests in the 1940s and 1950s and had stellar averages with the bat — 57.46 — and with the ball — 11.80. \nWilson died in 2010 and, two years ago, was named in the ICC’s Hall of Fame. media_camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T06:27:23.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
