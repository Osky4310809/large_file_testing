Fleming_007 June 28, 2016, 6:28 am \nWoo yeah pc release baby! Søren Hansen September 20, 2016, 5:03 am \nI think you miss an important clue in the trailer., after the baby disappears and the guy stands up, we are shown he has a big scar on his stomach., as if he the baby was removed from him., I have no idea if thats the case ofc, but since we see the scar it must mean something Pondo October 9, 2016, 4:01 pm \nThe game is P.T. or Silent Hills, and Kojima is playing us like a damn fiddle Bill December 2, 2016, 4:53 am \nIt was not confirmed for PC at all, that's only a rumor from a deleted Q&A. Randy H. December 2, 2016, 1:34 pm \nJust saw trailer on game awards and thought \"is that are those did that tentacle thing come out of that skeleton soldiers butt? please tell me thats not Hannibals 'O' face. There are actually a few places I wish NOT to go in video games mr K.\" Then I came to the realization that I can never unsee what I just saw. God was that trailer creepy af Ryan Fanus December 2, 2016, 3:23 pm \nIKR?!?! And I think I've figured out what this game is about from the creepiness. Norman is trapped in purgatory where the restless undead wage war relentlessly with one another. I think that might be it. I don't know. Gary December 4, 2016, 3:19 am \nPC will probably get a release in 2020 - 2021 lolz. Knowing now also that it's using the Horizon Dawn Zero Engine. Sweet news :D Gary December 4, 2016, 3:20 am \nThe good news is that it's using Horizon Dawn Zero engine :D Which I would assume is specialized and designed with console in mind :D Joseph December 4, 2016, 6:02 am \nSeems interesting, but not really \"exciting\", not yet anyway, to much is unknown. Terrance Jackson December 7, 2016, 5:28 am \nWhich has not been confirmed. I'd court that excitement and just buy a PS4 for it. :) WingsOfChicken December 8, 2016, 8:24 pm \nThere is not a single shred of evidence that it will come to PC. Never has a Sony Interactive Entertainment published game ever made its way to PC. Also Sony is funding the game on top of publishing it. Anthony Sherratt December 10, 2016, 11:58 pm \nThere is not a single shred of evidence that its been denied a PC release either. No one knows the deal Kojima made with Sony. Could potentially be a timed exclusive and/or possible other publisher? Bill December 18, 2016, 10:34 am \nIt being published by SOny the trademark is owned by Sony, they are using Sony's engine, there's not a single shred of evidence that The Last of us Part 2 won't be on PC but we all know it won't be. Bob Saget December 19, 2016, 3:30 pm \nLol they don't own the rights to the game only to publish it on console. So if Kojima finds another publisher or publishes it himself. Then it will come to pc just like how Dead Rising 3 came to pc published by Capcom but not PS4. Bill December 20, 2016, 4:28 am \nSource? or is what you're saying bull? cause it is.MS the company that lets all of it exclusives they helped fund go to PC let an exclusive go to PC? no way! \nIf Sony funds a new IP they own it, that's the reason Sunset Overdrive went to MS they let them keep the IP. \nIt being published by Sony the trademark is owned by Sony, they are using Sony's engine, Mark Cerny is working on the game as the technical producer, it is being completely by Sony, you have nothing but lies on your end. Bob Saget December 20, 2016, 4:39 am \nLol I love fanboys. I'll believe Kojima saying Death Stranding coming to pc in the future over some fanboy saying Death Stranding not coming to pc Bill December 20, 2016, 5:47 am \nHAHAHAHAAHHA show me where Kojima said it was going to PC, you can't cause he didn't. Bob Saget December 20, 2016, 5:58 am \nAt E3 this year kiddo. Bill December 20, 2016, 6:00 am \nWhy are you lying? do you get a kick out of it or something? \nHell why don't you show me the video where he says it. W4YNEWHITE January 19, 2017, 7:58 am \nIts funny how Exclusivity works. The power and ability of the PS4 is based on PC technology. The production of the game itself is based on PC technology. Every individual in Sony including the president depends on PC technology. Yet, PC is always the last to the table. Maybe its piracy, maybe its the ability to make more money on consoles before porting or maybe its the fact that it takes more work to adapt a game to many types of hardware over one type. I'm sure someone knows the answers. Dee Keyes January 25, 2017, 4:29 pm \nEven though PC is getting it later im just glad that we're getting at all. Anonymous February 7, 2017, 12:17 pm \nBuying a console just for one game is like buying a hospital for the treatment. It doesn't make any sense! Jeremy FIsher March 7, 2017, 10:56 am \nSony and Xbox pay for exclusivity most of the time, or they fund/own the particular studio making the game (In this case it is the former, Kojima's new studio has a deal with Sony). The Xbox division also keeps games out of windows because it hurts their sales. The windows platform is owned by Microsoft but they get a tiny share of the revenue from hardware sales from their surface line (and only the surfacebook can handle any real gaming). Plus the Xbox division is pretty independent from the main grouping, so they like to keep some exclusives so Xbox sales are not overly diluted by PC gaming. \nAside from that, making games for PC is still very different to making it for consoles. Although in terms of hardware (and indeed software for Xbox, as it now basically runs a version of windows) consoles are basically PCs, you have to consider the fact that PCs can come in an infinite variety of setups, with significant differences in hardware, software, drivers etc. Developing and optimising for a single platform or two (and perhaps four with the upgraded Xbox and PS4 coming up) is a lot easier than optimising it to run on PC. This is why, despite the fact that all games are developed on PCs, the majority of AAA studios still tends to send it off to another studio to port it to PC. Given the continuing resurgence of PC gaming as a major segment of the market, many publishers and developers (especially the major ones) now try to release on PC at the same time as consoles. But unfortunately, most still rely on third parties for PC ports, which means that badly optimised PC versions are still widespread.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:11:34.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
