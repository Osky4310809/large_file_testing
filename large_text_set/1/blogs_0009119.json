Many Google Voice users are currently able to see a banner at the top of their web account asking them to try “the new Google Voice”.\nSee also: “Ok Google” voice commands now supported by Android Auto December 1, 2016 At the moment, clicking on that tempting “TRY NOW” link only results in a refresh of the current page. In a statement sent to The Verge, the company admitted it is working on some kind of update:\nSorry, it looks like we must have dialed the wrong number! But don’t worry, this wasn’t a prank call. We’re working on some updates to Google Voice right now. We have you on speed dial and we’ll be sure to share what we’ve been up to just as soon as we can.\nIn case you are unfamiliar with Google Voice, it first launched in 2009 and gives anyone in the US with a Google account a free phone number, and calls sent from the service to anyone in the US and Canada are also free, with cheap international calls for everyone else. It also supports features like free PC-to-PC calls worldwide, voicemail and more. In 2014, Google started integrating Voice features into its Hangouts service. With Hangouts now transitioning into a service targeting business users , it will be interesting to see how Voice will work as well with these update plans.\nWe’ll be sure to keep you updated if we hear anything on the new Google Voice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:38:32.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
