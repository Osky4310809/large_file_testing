I've got my kid in the car.\" \nChristopher Taylor, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court : “Thankfully it’s not clear from his account that she was a witness to this defendant’s disgusting behaviour.” \nBerry, 30, from Liverpool, was arrested after the dad called the police. \nAnother customer also saw him performing a sex act at the petrol station at 7.30pm on December 13, the Liverpool Echo reports . \nThe drunken pervert told police he had downed eight pints of beer plus spirits in a drinking session with his boyfriend, which began at midday. \nHe was spared jail after admitting outraging public decency and possessing a small quantity of cannabis. \nHe received a community order in 2010 for the same sexual offence at Liverpool Lime Street station toilets.
