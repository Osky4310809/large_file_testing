Egg-cellent sweets will be available beginning March 17 at Candy Palace on Main Street, U.S.A., and Hunny Spot in Critter Country in Disneyland park; Trolley Treats in Disney California Adventure park; and Marceline’s Confectionery in the Downtown Disney District . The Mickey and Minnie Easter Basket Gourmet Apples are as delicious as they are beautiful – perfect to include in an Easter basket or as an egg hunt reward.\n\nAt Candy Palace, you’ll also find the famous handmade Disneyland Easter Eggs—while supplies last. Disneyland Candy Makers hand-shape each delicious egg, which is filled with house-made fudge then enrobed in milk chocolate. The eggs are offered in five flavors—Chocolate Cream, Chocolate-Nut, Vanilla-Nut, Black Walnut and my personal favorite, Peanut Butter.\nIf you’re looking for a special Easter Brunch, Storytellers Café at Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa will have special offerings on April 16. PCH Grill at Paradise Pier Hotel will also have Easter Brunch and Dinner April 14-16. Reservations can be made by visiting Disneyland.com/dining or by calling 714-781-DINE.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:06:55.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
