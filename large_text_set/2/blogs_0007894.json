We are optimistic on that.” \nThe President was expected to sign the draft last October. \nUnder the proposed EO, smoking may only be allowed in open spaces and posters warning of the ill effects of smoking must be displayed prominently.   \nEvery hour, an estimated 10 Filipino people die due to cancer and other smoking-related diseases.
