But let's just pretend for a second that it is. There have been so many adverts featuring footballers this year that it seems only right that there should be some sort of award/award ceremony. \nAnd out of dozens of contenders, we've whittled it down to just five footballers. Which means players such as Wayne Rooney, Gareth Bale and Eden Hazard all miss out. \nHere are the nominations: Antoine Griezmann in 'Matchmaker' (Photo: Puma) \nThe Atletico Madrid forward stars in a hilarious Puma advert, and uses his trademark celebration to help men with their women troubles. David Beckham in 'H&M with Kevin Hart' (Photo: H&M) \nThe Manchester United legend stars alongside Hollywood A-lister Kevin Hart. Hart is set to play Beckham in an upcoming movie, and is shadowing Goldenballs to learn everything he can. Cristiano Ronaldo in 'Home Alone' \nThe Real Madrid forward starred in a remake of Christmas classic Home Alone. He even pulled off the famous aftershave scream. Neymar in 'XXX: Return of Xander Cage' (Photo: Paramount Brasil / Youtube) \nThe only footballer who actually starred in a film this year. The Barcelona forward made his big screen debut as Vin Diesel reprised the role of Xander Cage. Paul Pogba in 'Football Needs Creators' (Photo: YouTube/adidas) \nThe world's most expensive footballer starred in a movie advert about his life. Pogba plays himself in the end, taking the lead role. poll loading And the 2017 Oscars 'Best Male Footballer' award goes to... 0+ VOTES SO FAR David Beckham in 'H&M with Kevin Hart' Cristiano Ronaldo in 'Home Alone' Neymar in 'XXX: Return of Xander Cage' Paul Pogba in 'Football Needs Creators' Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T16:27:30.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
