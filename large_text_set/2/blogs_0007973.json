Durkin | 7:47 am, February 13th, 2017 \nTo kick off the fourth season of the Emmy-winning late night show Last Week Tonight , host John Oliver devoted his deep-dive segment to the twisted lying of President Donald Trump , a subject that the host himself admitted he really wished he didn’t have to focus on. \n“We have a President capable of standing in the rain and saying it was a sunny day,” offered Oliver Sunday night, with the video to prove it. \nThe focus of the 23-minute segment can be best encapsulated in this one line: “Trump’s reality can change within a single sentence,” as Oliver and the Last Week Tonight staff dug deep into the exaggerations, fibs, falsehoods, misrepresentations, and “outright bullshit,” that we somehow all just accept as the new normal. \nTake this exchange for instance; Oliver played back a clip of Trump recently saying to a crowd, “Our gross domestic product — a sign of strength, right? — but not for us. It was below zero. Who ever heard of this?” \nOliver responded to prove his point, “OK, OK just real quick on these. No it isn’t, no he did’t, and no one has ever heard of a GDP below zero because it is fucking impossible .” \nOliver also slammed the President’s sources for original news reporting — namely anything he catches on Fox & Friends or the latest Breitbart headline — saying, “He is now making real policy off of fake facts.” \nThe Last Week Tonight host continued: \nThere is a pattern here: Trump sees something that jives with his world view, doesn’t check it, half-remembers it, and the passes it on. And which point, it takes on a life of its own and appears to validate itself. \nAnd finally, Last Week Tonight ended the segment with a bit of proactive advocacy aimed at helping the problem; after highlighting all the ways in which Trump’s version of the truth largely stems from cable news, Oliver said, “There is some small way we wanted to leak some useful facts into his media diet.” The solution? We’ve actually created a series of commercials… [and] we’re going to run them on cable news.” What transpired were commercials similar in tone to actual Fox News ads, now complete with information to help our President make more informed decisions. \n“Until we’re shut down, we are prepared to educated Donald Trump on topics we’re pretty sure he doesn’t know about,” Oliver concluded. \nWatch above via HBO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:52:36.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
