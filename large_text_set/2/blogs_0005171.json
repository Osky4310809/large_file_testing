This was one of the Birnies' trademarks. \nThe program also names a seventh possible murder victim of David Birnie, 12-year-old Lisa Mott, who was last seen getting into a yellow panel van in the West Australian town of Collie on October 9, 1980. \nDavid Birnie had worked in the area and was said to have owned a similar vehicle at the time. \nHowever, the program interviewed his first wife, who gave him an alibi for the day that would have made his involvement in the murder impossible. \nAnother woman described being stalked by David Birnie and how she now believes she was to be the couples first victim. \nIn October 1985, Birnie repeatedly harassed Audrey Schofield, the receptionist in a small real estate agency near where the Birnies lived. \n\"He came back every day for at least a week. He was making suggestions like 'I only like brunettes with brown eyes',\" Ms Schofield said. \"As soon as I was alone he came in.\" \nShe said she eventually got rid of him when her husband confronted him.
