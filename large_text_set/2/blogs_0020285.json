Because we don’t see any difference between that and what happened on Friday: Another earnest question, seeking information: What’s the difference between what happened today and this? https://t.co/UpVu8cs8u0 \nFrom the New York Times : \nWASHINGTON — Hours after President Obama announced in a 2014 speech that he was escalating his campaign against Islamic extremists, a number of prominent columnists suggested they knew exactly what he was thinking. \nMichael Tomasky, a correspondent for The Daily Beast, wrote that “Obama clearly feels he has the constitutional authority to go after ISIS anywhere and everywhere.” Gerald F. Seib, the Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was equally certain about what “the president calculated.” \nThe next day, Fred Kaplan wrote in a Slate column that “Obama is loath to bring Iran or Assad’s Syria — both Shiite regimes — into the alliance” and asserted with confidence that “Obama is allergic to ‘mission creep.’” \nWhat none of the journalists told readers, because they had promised the White House that they would not, was that their attempts to portray the president’s intentions had followed a lengthy and secret meeting with Mr. Obama the day he delivered the speech. \nDemocracy dies in darkness, or something. Shouldn’t we see the reactions of the 18 columnists in the room? \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:52:16.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
