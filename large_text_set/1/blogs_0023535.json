This is not the country he dreamed of, not what he served for and not what he died for. Since his death I have embarked on the most meaningful work of my life, supporting the men and women who, like Pat, fight for what this country can be. As I read posts from the community of #Tillman Scholars on my Facebook feed I am encouraged; they are exactly as I knew they would be, poised and ready to fight. I am proud of them and proud to stand with them, we’ve got this.” A statue of Pat Tillman at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

The family were reportedly not given clear details by the military and were led to believe Tillman died as a result of enemy fire, not learning for about five weeks the truth of what happened. \nPat Tillman made the decision to leave the NFL and join the Army out of a sense of patriotic duty to his country, according to CBS News . \n“You know, my great-grandfather was at Pearl Harbor, and a lot of my family has given up, has gone and fought in wars, and I really haven’t done a damn thing, as far as laying myself on the line like that. And so I have a great deal of appreciation for those who have,” Pat Tillman said at the time. \nAfter Pat Tillman’s death, Marie Tillman and his family founded the Pat Tillman Foundation , which provides scholarships for military veterans and their spouses. The foundation’s website claims it has awarded over $14 million in scholarships since 2004 to 460 recipients, beginning with a $1.25 million dollar pledge for a scholarship program at Arizona State University, where Pat Tillman attended school before being drafted by the Arizona Cardinals.

A group of lawyers from the ACLU challenged the ban in court, receiving a temporary block from deportations from a federal judge in New York, according to The Chicago Tribune . \nDonald Trump and administration officials are staunchly defending the immigration ban, saying it is necessary for the safety and security of the United States and that over the course of the next 90 days, case-by-case decisions will be made to allow those with visas re-entry. However, there does seem to be some confusion over how the ban will impact current visa and green card holders, indicating that the extent of the impact of the ban’s implementation was not carefully weighed by the administration prior to the signing of the executive order. \nPat Tillman’s exact stance on Donald Trump’s immigration ban can never be known due to his tragic death, but Marie Tillman apparently feels confident in stating what his opinion would have been. Her decision to go public with her thoughts is sure to bring her a fair amount of both praise and criticism regarding an issue that is currently dividing much of the country.
