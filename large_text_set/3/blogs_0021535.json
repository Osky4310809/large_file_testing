The band's death metal is crisp, black, and while it possesses the charm of their American counterparts, it remains open-minded and organic. This should not come as a surprise, considering the band's impressive line-up and cemented position as one the the best Polish acts of the genre. \nAzarath crept from the shadows almost two decades ago, by the will of Inferno (of Behemoth fame) and then-members Bruno and D. Six albums later, the band's line-up is shaped by the said Behemoth drummer, together with Bart (Armagedon, Damnation) on guitars, Necrosodom (Anima Damnata, Deus Mortem) on vocals and guitars, as well as Peter (ex-Lost Soul) on bass. \nMeaning \"at the point of death\" or \"under extreme circumstances\" in Latin, \"In Extremis\" is yet another apex reached by Azarath. The effort arrives six long years after its predecessor, \"Blasphemers' Maledictions\" (2011), and places the band back at the fore of the genre, with strong ties to the group's early cult albums. Black as a night and dense as tar, \"In Extremis\" offers a whirlwind of chaotic currents ready to overwhelm. \nThe eerie painting that adorns the album's cover was made by Marta Promińska (Hypnagogic Painting). Graphic design and layout were done by Mentalporn (Behemoth, Origin, Decapitated) with calligraphy provided by Ihasan Art and additional work by Holy Poison Design. \nFollowing the album's release, Azarath will play at Inferno Festival (Norway) and Party.San Festival (Germany). The record release show will take place in Warsaw (Poland) a few weeks after album's street date. \nAdditionally, you can pre-order the physical copies of \"In Extremis\" here and digital copies here . Of course, we'd like to send a big thanks to the Agonia Records folks for making this possible. \nGive a listen to \"Let My Blood Become His Flesh\" below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T06:26:58.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
