Things take an ugly turn when the trio is confronted by a few outlaw bikers at a hole-in-the-wall bar, but it was nothing they couldn’t handle. Armed with stacks of Benjamins, Kandypens and a little liquid courage, they take down each opponent one-by-one. \nDirected by DAPS and Migos, the video is indicative of the kinetic energy behind Migos’ killer year. The song was taken from the Atlanta group’s #1 album, CULTURE, which was released at the end of January 2017. Now, Migos is not only able to afford as many Kandypens as they want, but also plenty of that Versace they rapped about in their 2013 hit of the same name. When you’re feeling sultry, grab a Kandypen. Feeling froggy? Just open a box of Kandypens instead. Want to look fierce? Put a Kandypen to your lips. \nFat Joe, French Montana, A$AP Rocky , Remy Ma, Chris Brown, 50 Cent, Lil Uzi Vert, Nas, Kanye West, Young Thug, Tyga, Jadakiss, K-Camp, Kid Ink, and Fetty Wap have all represented the brand in their videos. Kandypens was named the best vaporizer of 2016 by High Times, which makes it only natural for artists to seek them out. According to the popular marijuana publication, the brand represents the newest generation of pen vaporizers with a stellar combination of popular technology and flashy design. Kandypens is the clearly go-to choice for vaping in the Hip Hop and rap community. Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You!
