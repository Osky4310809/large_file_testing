Whether someone has a crying baby or is throwing a full-blown tantrum themselves, passenger behavior can make or break an in-flight experience. But what are the most annoying things people can do on planes?\nTravel website Expedia just released the results of its airplane etiquette study, which identifies passenger behaviors that most infuriate fellow travelers.\nMore Travel videos 1:27 Flight 666 bound for HEL lands safely on Friday the 13th 3:39 See the eco-friendly hotels, mobile apps that are the top travel trends of 2017 4:03 Winter travel destinations you can escape to on a budget 2:26 Massive customs outage at airports nationwide delays thousands of travelers “As we embark on 2017, millions and millions of people will be taking to the air this year, and should know that there’s no better gift you can give to a fellow traveler than respect and generosity,” said John Morrey, vice president and general manager at Expedia, in a statement. “The airplane etiquette study shows that small acts of decorum can go a long way. After all, as it relates to flights, we are quite literally all in this together.”\nRELATED: How to fly on a private jet for $29\nAlamy Stock Rear seat kicking was the No. 1 biggest complaint, according to Expedia. The study was conducted by GfK, an independent global market research company, which solicited feedback from 1,005 Americans age 18 and over. So what was the behavior that earned the most fury? Rear seat kicking. Sixty-four percent of those surveyed cited the “Rear Seat Kicker” as the most problematic passenger. Just behind that are “Inattentive Parents” (59 percent), defined as “parents who have no control over, or pay no attention to, their crying, whining or misbehaved children.”\nRELATED: 8 things your flight attendant wishes you knew\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display Background Enhancements font\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans size\nT T T T color\nshare link See the eco-friendly hotels, mobile apps that are the top travel trends of 2017 Play Video - 3:39 See the eco-friendly hotels, mobile apps that are the top travel trends of 2017 Play Video - 3:39 While people certainly don’t like being physically touched by other passengers or hearing their children, the No. 3 complaint is an assault on another sense: smell. “Aromatic” passengers — those with poor hygiene or those wearing excessive cologne or perfume — are the third least-liked (55 percent), followed by the “Audio Insensitive” (49 percent), the passenger who talks loudly or listens to music without consideration for fellow fliers.\nShutterstock Inattentive parents ranked high as a grievance for passengers. RELATED : Airline passenger's ponytail sparks internet outrage, debate over in-flight etiquette\nRounding out the top five is “The Boozer,” a drunken, disruptive person, which is the biggest complaint for 49 percent of those surveyed. Interestingly, only 12 percent of Americans claim to consume more than two alcoholic drinks when flying, so this annoyance shouldn’t be as widespread as the other behaviors.\nOther rarer complaints include those who undress (28 percent) and passengers who display an “inappropriate level of public affection” toward one another (28 percent). But, just under 3 percent of Americans report having “been physically intimate” with a fellow passenger aboard a plane.\nAlamy Stock Booze and planes don't mix. Though the list includes 14 major grievances, most people (79 percent) felt that “for the most part, fellow passengers are considerate of one another,” and 74 percent “thoroughly clean their space before leaving the plane.” In addition, 4 out of 10 fliers report having helped another passenger with luggage, while 28 percent have offered up their seat to another.\nHere's the full list of etiquette violators:\n1. The Rear Seat Kicker\n2. Inattentive Parents\n3. The Aromatic Passenger\n4. The Audio Insensitive\n5. The Boozer\n6. Chatty Cathy\n7. The Queue Jumper\n8. Seat-Back Guy\n9. The Armrest Hog\n10.
