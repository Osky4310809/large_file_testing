I mean have you done any self-examination?” he was asked. \nTurnbull replied: “Well Laurie like all of us we we all reflect on what we do and how we can improve.” Labor aims to recruit renegade Coalition MPs in push for marriage equality by Mardi Gras Read more \nOn same sex marriage, which blew up dramatically on the weekend with news some Liberal backbenchers were contemplating making a fresh push for a free vote in parliament, Turnbull said his party’s policy for was a plebiscite. \n“I took to the last election the policy of my party and my government which was to have a plebiscite,” he said. \n“We are calling on Bill Shorten to rethink his position and if he supports the plebiscite, then it’ll pass through the Senate, then it will be held and every Australian will have a say.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:59:33.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
