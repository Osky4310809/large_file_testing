Apple, of course, will put its own spin on what we’ve seen already, likely mixing designs from the iPhone 4 and iPhone 7.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com ETNews goes on to say the iPhone 8’s OLED display will be “relatively flat,” rather than the dramatic curves featured in Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge. We’ve heard conflicting reports about the iPhone 8’s display being curved and not being curved . Chances are it’ll be somewhere in the middle.\nTenth anniversary Considering the iPhone 8 will arrive ten years after the original iPhone, an homage makes sense. But let’s not get too nostalgic. As cool as the original iPhone’s design was, that was ten years ago.\nHopefully, the iPhone 8’s design will feel like a major step forward, not a step back. After all, the iPhone design has remained virtually unchanged since the iPhone 6 was released in 2014, so we’re certainly due for an update.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:00:32.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
