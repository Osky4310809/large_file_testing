They are Carey-like,” Brown told Fox Footy’s On the Couch . \nLISTEN TO THE LATEST FOX FOOTY PODCAST BELOW, OR TAP HERE TO SUBSCRIBE IN ITUNES \n“He sets up goals, is a good goalkicker and is the best contested mark in the competition. What more can I say?” \nBrown then ranked Eddie Betts ahead of Cyril Rioli in the race to be the game’s best small forward, preferring the Crow’s numbers from 2017. \nBetts’ captain Taylor Walker slotted in sixth with GWS Giant and 2016 All-Australian Toby Greene then ahead of returning Hawk Jarryd Roughead. Cat Tom Hawkins and Tiger Jack Riewoldt rounded out the top ten. \nHowever the list doesn’t include two of the game’s most exciting and promising young tall forwards in the game, with Collingwood’s Darcy Moore and Melbourne’s Jesse Hogan both not making the cut. \nJONATHAN BROWN’S TOP 10 FORWARDS AS OF ROUND 1, 2017 \n1. Tom Lynch (Gold Coast Suns) \n2. Lance Franklin (Sydney Swans) \n3. Josh Kennedy (West Coast Eagles) \n4.
