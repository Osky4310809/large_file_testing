Selfies were nearly impossible, so you were always dependent on others to get your good side. If you looked at an entire roll of photos, most of them would be shit (red-eye, closed eyes, bad lighting), but we’d pick out the most flattering ones and plaster them on our doors, our walls, in picture frames. That’s how we signified fun and social connection before Facebook and Instagram were there to make it look prettier, with better lighting.\nWhen someone did something stupid, like “surf” an old mattress out a second-story window down into the bushes, or host a jello slip ’n’ slide, there was no roomful of iPhones waiting to document it. Just our own anecdotes, polished like precious stones. If you looked good or had a great time at a party, the only people who knew it were the other people at that party. No one was glued to their phone, scrolling through Twitter; no one was texting someone about where to meet them; no one was saying “call me later and we’ll figure out plans,” because you just made plans and followed through on them. It was a life of immediacy, of presence, of now.\nID: 10281564 Or at least that’s the story we like to tell ourselves. Our unmediated lives slowly became infiltrated with gadgets: A friend came back to school in 2002 with a digital camera, and suddenly, with hundreds of photos of each event, all of our exploits seemed a lot more banal. Freshmen showed up to parties at our house and loitered outside the door when we told them there were no cell phones allowed, but we knew it was a losing war.\nOur lack of connection with the outside world only exacerbated the bubble feeling of an expensive, mostly white liberal arts college. People didn’t see anything wrong with throwing parties with themes like “White Trash” or “Pimps and Hos” because we had no mirror to reflect them, and their warped Othering, back at us — or an online audience to call them out. That bubble is part of why I had best friends who were women but wasn’t really introduced to feminism, let alone intersectionality, until grad school; why emailing “I lost my virginity at the Beer Mile” from a friend’s email account was fucked up but no one said so; why many of those friends had sexual encounters that treaded the line of consent — except that we hadn’t learned the language to name it as such.\nIn the transitional digital world, it was much harder for people from backgrounds that weren’t white and middle-class to find out about a school like ours in the first place. There’s a reason it was nicknamed White-Man College. And while there were certainly conversations happening on campus about gender, sexuality, race, class, and sexual assault, they felt like discrete issues, disarticulated from the systemic issues of oppression, exclusion, and power.\nConstant connectivity can feel exhausting and distracting, a portal to an never-ending cyclone of stuff , of everything-always-happening-all-the-time. There are days I yearn for a time when the most I could know about a person’s online history was the last IP address they used to check their email. I’ve forgotten what it feels like to wait — for the train, in line for groceries, at the doctor’s office — with only the quiet pulse of my own thoughts for company.\nToday, disconnection is for those with the privilege — and accumulated power — to afford it.\nID: 10281655 Those experiences are still possible, of course. They just involve a modicum of willpower, which is something that, as a college student, I didn’t have all that much of. I don’t envy all the ways that students today experience distraction, all the streaming options and texts and homework assignments competing in the attention economy. But with those distractions comes exposure: to viewpoints, lived experiences, and ideologies that are not your own, that challenge and sophisticate your understanding of the world — and underline the notion that college is a time for figuring out who you are, but also figuring out that the things you say and do have real ramifications for the world and others around you. Today, disconnection is for those with the privilege — and accumulated power — to afford it.\nPart of what made 1999 so blissful for me and my friends was being sequestered in a safe, consequence-free corner of the world where we, the chosen ones of a liberal arts education, could live with very little direct challenge or sustained self-interrogation.\nI miss telnet; I miss Finger; I miss that guy and whiteboards and bad VHS tapes and the anticipation of opening a new packet of photos. But I don’t miss the feeling that the world I could see and know firsthand was the only world, and experience, that mattered.\nID: 10281571 View this image ›\nAleesha Nandhra for BuzzFeed News\nID: 10281576 This is part of a series of essays on the year 1999 ; you can check out the other stories here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T17:42:39.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
