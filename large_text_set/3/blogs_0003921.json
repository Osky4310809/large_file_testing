Philip Hammond snapped: \"This demonstration politics isn’t helping\" (Photo: BBC) \nMr McDonnell's return shows he paid income tax of £16,177 in 2015/16 on earnings of £66,943. He did not declare any earnings from a second job. \nMr Hammond, who made his fortune via stakes in a nursing home developer and from consultancy work, is one of Parliament's richest MPs with a net worth estimated at £8.2million in 2014. \nThis week the Shadow Chancellor revealed Labour would force people who earn £1million a year to publish their tax records public. \nMr Hammond slammed the plan, saying: \"That is likely to drive away talent and investors that Britain needs to create the global future we’re trying to build.\" \nBritish tax laws work under a strict principle of confidentiality between individual bill-payers and HM Revenue and Customs, making Mr McDonnell's idea a radical shake-up. \nIn a round of TV interviews today, Mr Hammond also warned there would be no \"spending spree\" in his 2017 Budget on Wednesday. John McDonnell's return shows he paid income tax of £16,177 in 2015/16 \nIt's been revealed the Budget will give councils more than £1bn emergency cash for social care, £500m for skills training and a crackdown on misleading small print. \nBut Mr Hammond said: \"If someone gives you a bit more headroom on your credit card it doesn’t mean you need to rush out and spend it all at once.\" \nMr Hammond also warned the EU that Britain will \"fight back\" and not \"slink off like a wounded animal\" if it does not get the Brexit deal it wants. \nIn some of the toughest talking yet ahead of the UK triggering Article 50, the Chancellor said Britain would \"do whatever we need to do\" to be competitive in the event of leaving the EU without a trade agreement. \nMr Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: \"If there is anybody in the European Union who thinks that if we don't do a deal with the European Union, if we don't continue to work closely together, Britain will simply slink off as a wounded animal, that is not going to happen. \n\"British people have a great fighting spirit and we will fight back. We will forge new trade deals around the world. We will build our business globally.\" \nAsked if this meant the UK would slash business taxes to become a Singapore-style tax haven, he said: \"People can read what they like into it. I'm not going to speculate now on how the UK would respond to what I don't expect to be the outcome.\" Theresa May is facing tense negotiations over an EU 'divorce bill' (Photo: REUTERS) \nElsewhere Mr Hammond indicated Britain WOULD pay a 'divorce bill' ordered by the EU, telling ITV's Robert Peston: \"If there are any outstanding dues we obliged to pay of course we will pay them. That’s the sort of country we are.\" \nBut he dismissed claims of a 60billion Euros figure, saying: \"This is positioning ahead of a negotiation and we should see it for exactly what it is.\" \nHe said the pound's fall against the dollar would cause higher inflation. \nAnd he signalled he would be \"dealing with the short-term disparities” which have left councils desperate for social care funding. \n\"This isn’t a shift at all,\" he said. \"Nobody is going to lose any benefit here.\" Read More \nAnd he failed to deny the Tories could face fresh by-elections amid a police investigation into how 2015 election expenses were declared. \n\"The party has already acknowledged we made an administrative error,\" he said. \n\"The due process has to be followed through and we will co operate fully with the Electoral Commission.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T14:10:20.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
