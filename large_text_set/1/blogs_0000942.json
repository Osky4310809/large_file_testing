After the Space Pirates are discovered in the Bermuda System , the Galactic Federation asks Samus to investigate their activities. She is briefly seen flying over Excelcion , and she destroys one of the missile factories on Talvania while the Force destroys another . During M10: Black Hole , Samus contacts the Force directly to warn them of a fifth Missile Transport ship, which they destroy. She also assists the Force after the Rohkor Beetle battle, using her Ship Missiles to finish it off. After M14: Tremor , the Force mysteriously loses all contact with Samus. \nA Decoy item in the game deploys a scarecrow-like model of her to distract Space Pirates. Battle \nIn M22: Convergence , it is revealed that Samus was captured by the Space Pirates and brought aboard their battleship Doomseye . She is then brainwashed, transformed into gigantic size, and forced to fight against the Federation Force, serving as the game's final boss. After she is defeated, she reverts back to her normal size, but is then buried under falling debris. She survives, and later assists the Federation Force in escaping the battleship's destruction, and rescues them with her Gunship when they are sucked into the vacuum of space. At the end of the mission, she commends the Federation Force and looks forward to their future efforts. \nSamus spends the entire fight in gigantic Morph Ball form, laying large destroyable Bombs in sets of three and attempts to ram the Marine with Boost Ball . She constantly rolls around the field, however she does not actively chase the Marines. \nSamus is surrounded by a purple shield that negates all the Marines' attacks, although she can be frozen with the Freeze Shot . However, the shield does not cover the green cores on her sides, which if shot enough times disables the shield and stops her movement. Once the shield is down, the Marine must shoot and push her into the electric fields at the edges of the room, similar to Blast Ball . After enough damage, Samus regains her shield, repeating the process. \nOnce she loses all her health, Samus shrinks slightly but regains all her health; the process must be repeated two more times. After one full depletion Samus will start using her Spider Ball to roll across the ceiling, eventually stopping at the center to drop down to the ground and produce a shockwave. After the second full depletion Samus rolls much faster, drops larger red Bombs, and also lays Bombs while using Boost Ball and Spider Ball. Her Bombs can be destroyed to get AUX ammo . The mission's bonus objective is to never take damage from Samus's Bombs. Behind the Scenes Concept and Creation “ Samus is an ideal role model not just to me, but for many women to look up to as a powerful game icon. In a video game realm with princesses aplenty, Samus stands out as an atypical Nintendo gal holding the title of one of gaming's strongest symbols of courage, power, and heroism. „ Samus Aran in her signature Varia Suit from Metroid Prime . Early concept art of Samus Aran. \nSamus Aran first appeared in 1986, as the playable protagonist in the video game Metroid . Originally, Samus was created solely as an alternate identity for the player to put themselves into and was given no separate personality or defining features, characteristic of the creative treatment of many video game characters of the time. Partway through the development process, one member of the team suggested: \"Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if the character turned out to be a woman?” A vote was held and Samus was changed into a woman. Since the film series Alien was acknowledged as a major influence in the development of Metroid , it is reasonable to assume that the inspiration for making Samus a woman may have very well come from the film's own Ellen Ripley. Indeed, in the Nintendo Power -published Super Metroid comic, her personality was based on a mix of Ripley and Princess Leia from the Star Wars series. Contrary to popular belief, Samus was not created by Metroid producer Gunpei Yokoi . The original game concepts were done by game director Makoto Kanōh and were designed by Hiroji Kiyotake . [6] Concept art for Samus in Metroid: Zero Mission \nSuper Metroid marked the first time Samus ever spoke in a game, narrating the events directly after Metroid II: Return of Samus . Her speaking role was expanded in Metroid Fusion , where she spoke in more narrative monologues, and also conversations with her computer. Though Fusion was well praised, there was some controversy over Samus’s speaking role and as a result, aside from an opening narration in Metroid: Zero Mission , she did not speak again until Metroid: Other M , the first Metroid game to give Samus voiced dialogue. \nYoshio Sakamoto based the image of Samus Aran for Super Metroid on actress Kim Bassinger . She was also briefly nude when she died in this game with a voice by Minako Hamano , but these elements were reconsidered because of American sensitivity to nudity and the voice sounding \"too sexual\", so Tomomi Yamane added the bathing suit to her and the voice acting was removed. Sakamoto claimed in a Super Metroid interview that he has \"a special version of the ROM\" with the original death sequence. Sakamoto also claimed in this interview to be the only person to know \"where Samus' beauty mark is,\" which later turned up in Metroid: Other M under the left side of her lip and was marked in concept art for Metroid Prime , but was not added to the model. [5] Despite the absence of Hamano's voice in the final game, there is some sound that comes from Samus. When panting on the ground after being weakened by Mother Brain, she begins breathing heavily after the baby leaves, but stops when it comes back to heal her. \nSamus first received a voice actor in the game Metroid Prime , where she was voiced by Jennifer Hale . Samus has no in-game dialogue, however, and speaks only in various grunts and yells when damaged, a scream when killed, and rarely, breathing when at low energy or when at an extreme climate. Hale has remained her voice actress throughout the entire Prime series and it is unknown if she will return to reprise the role in future games. Her second voice actress was Alesia Glidewell in Super Smash Bros. Brawl . Glidewell also voices Knuckle Joe and Krystal in the same game. Most surprising about Glidewell's depiction of her is that Samus is given a voice-over with speaking lines for the first time. While she is in her Zero Suit (a separate character known as Zero Suit Samus ), she speaks for all three of her taunts, and one victory cutscene. Her lines are: \"Is that all?\" \"You’re mine.\" \"Be still.\" \nMetroid: Other M features Samus speaking again, voiced by Jessica Martin . In the Japanese version, she is voiced by Ai Kobayashi . \nIn the Japanese commercial for Metroid: Zero Mission , Samus is portrayed by Chisato Morishita . \nThe name Samus is the female variant of the name Seamus, which is Celtic for James, which means: \"He who supplants\". Her last name of Aran may refer to the Aran Islands on the west coast of Ireland. Combining the two gives the meaning: \"She who supplants an island\" or \"She who conquers an isolated area by force.\" [7] Pronunciation of the name over the years has varied from either SAMUHS A-RUHN (as in the verb \"run\"), A-RAHN (using the \"CAT\" vowel for the first two As and the verb form of \"ran\"), but it wasn’t until the release of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption that pronunciation of her name was finally cemented as SAMUHS ERR-EN, and it is likely to remain this way since. An interview with several of the developers of the original Metroid states that her name originated from the famous footballer Edson Aran tes \"Pelé\" do Nascimento [6] . Gender \nSamus' true identity as a woman was a heavily guarded secret, and was obscured by the already simple Power Suit’s androgynous appearance. The game manuals for Metroid in Japan used pronouns like \"it\" mainly because the Japanese language only has gender-neutral pronouns like aista . The American manuals flat-out referred to Samus as a \"he\", but it is unknown if this was a an attempt to keep Samus' gender a secret or simply a mistranslation. Only by beating the game in under an hour could the player gain access to a secret ending where Samus would remove her Power Suit and reveal herself as a woman. It has become a tradition for Samus to do so in every Metroid game since, if the player completes the proper in-game requirements. \nIn the 1994 Japanese Super Metroid official guide, a number of biography cards were published about each of the members of the development team. Hirofumi Matsuoka , one of the background artists and a designer for Samus in the original game, answered one of the questions (which asked if there were any secrets of Samus that only he knew) with the statement \"Samus isn't a woman. As a matter of fact, she's actually a newhalf.\" [8] Newhalf ( ニューハーフ , nyūhāfu ? ) is a Japanese slang term used to refer to transgender women or transvestites, roughly equivalent to the English slur \"shemale\". [9] The sincerity of this quote has since become a source of heated debate; many fans have cited it as canonical proof of Samus being a trans woman, while others have dismissed it as a crude joke from a non-authoritative source. [10] Regardless of Matsuoka's intentions, his statement has been contradicted (and likely outranked) by series co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto , who joked in 2004 that a Metroid game on the PlayStation 2 would be \"as likely as Samus Aran being a newhalf.\" [11] Role in other media \"What's the matter? All I said was that Komaytos look like little Metr—\" Non-canon warning : This article or section contains information that may not be considered an official part of the Metroid series in the overall storyline by Nintendo . \nBeing one of Nintendo’s flagship franchises, Metroid , and Samus with it, have been featured in a variety of other media, as cameos, or in promotional material, as well as being mentioned or spoofed in other games or on television. Super Smash Bros. series \nSamus is one of the original eight characters in the Super Smash Bros. series and has appeared in all four games to date. The wide array of weapons she can use include Missiles , Super Missiles , the Charge Beam , the Grapple Beam , the Screw Attack , and Bombs , as well as a flamethrower. Her Gunship from Metroid II: Return of Samus appears as a trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee , Brawl and the fourth games. \nIn Super Smash Bros. Brawl , Samus is given access to a powerful new weapon as her Final Smash: the Zero Laser . It allows her to fire a gigantic beam of incredible strength, but consumes so much energy that Samus’s Power Suit falls apart, revealing her Zero Suit . Samus's appearance behind the Power Suit is completely original in this installment. In her normal Power Suit form, Samus tends to be a heavyweight character who's rather floatly in midair, but tends to pack a decent amount of power. In the Zero Suit form however, she becomes far faster and gains access to her Paralyzer , which she can use as an energy whip and to fire stunning shots, though at a small cost lacks a bit of her original raw power. In the fourth games, the Zero Laser no longer destroys the Power Suit, and Zero Suit Samus is a separately selectable character. \nThis is a list of Samus' moves in the series. Adventure Mode: The Subspace Emissary Samus Aran as she appears in The Subspace Emissary . \nSamus also plays a role in Brawl's Adventure mode: The Subspace Emissary. In it, she first appears in her Zero Suit, breaking into the base of the Subspace Army on the Island of the Ancients. Soon she comes across a Pikachu being drained of its electrical power. Samus uses her whip to break the container the Pikachu is being held in, summoning a security force of R.O.B.s. The two join forces to retrieve Samus’s Power Suit, but are confronted by two Shadow Bug clones mimicking it. \nAfter reacquiring her Power Suit, Samus and Pikachu come across Ridley . He grabs Samus and starts to drag her against the wall, until Pikachu returns Samus' favor and uses Thunder on Ridley, causing him to drop Samus. An infuriated Ridley attacks. Once they defeat him, the duo exits the base and come across a cave where R.O.B.s are exiting with newly manufactured Subspace Bombs. \nSamus and Pikachu make their way through the Subspace Bomb Factory and find the Ancient Minister with the R.O.B. Squad. They prepare to fight, but then realize that he looks very sad. At that moment, Captain Falcon, Olimar, Diddy and DK burst in. A hologram of Ganondorf appears and orders the R.O.B. Squad to activate the remaining bombs. The Ancient Minister tries to stop them, but is set on fire when Ganondorf orders them to retaliate. After the Ancient Minister is revealed to be a R.O.B. himself, Samus and the other characters all rush out to escape the Island before it is engulfed, but are confronted by Meta Ridley and duel him aboard the Falcon Flyer. \nSamus groups up with the other fighters to lead an assault on the Subspace Gunship, during which she uses her own gunship as a distraction to buy enough time for Kirby to arrive on the Dragoon. She and the other fighters head into the Subspace Realm, but she is defeated by Tabuu and turned into a trophy when Tabuu arrives and uses his Off Waves to defeat all who are attacking him. King Dedede later comes to save her and she continues with the others to lead the final attack on Tabuu.
