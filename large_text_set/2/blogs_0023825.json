The 411 on 007 is maybe he’s A-1 on BS. Remember him burping “I’d rather slash my wrists than play James Bond again?” Oh, please. Dannyboy’s ready to stir that martini.\nHis flicks like “Skyfall” made a windfall. The fall he wanted was a cashfall. While he kept grunting “no, no” and while an alphabet soup of names were mentioned as replacements, he did off-B’way’s “Othello” with David Oyelowo. Its producer? Barbara Broccoli, producer of the Bond franchise.\nAs Isaac Newton might say: The contract doesn’t fall far from the tree.\nHollywood know-it-alls who know it all categorize this hard-to-catch play as a ploy. He says he hates filming those Bonds , but he knows he loves those Benjamins.\nSwift shift to wax Miss Taylor Swift dumped Tom Hiddleston , but Madame Tussauds grabbed him. He’s Captain James Conrad in a bamboo jungle with fake-o spider traps and an 18-foot interactive animatronic multisensory colossal robotic beast. Ferocious King Kong grunts, snarls, roars. Not Tom. Kong. His head hair’s 350 feet. Not Tom. Kong. Tom’s all wax.\n“Kong: Skull Island” opens in March. Where Tom will be, I don’t know. Neither does Swift.\nOscars start The Oscars. It was the ’20s. Louis B. Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Studios saw unionization encroaching. To thwart a possibility of expensive individual labor agreements, he created the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Elite moviemakers like Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford signed on. From this evolved the doling out of medals, scrolls and plaques. Said Mayer: “Give them awards, and they’ll kill themselves to produce what I want.”\nFirst ceremony, May 1929. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel’s Blossom Ballroom, where 250 ate fish and chicken (now they get nothing), gave statuettes (nothing’s changed), and there was no media (everything’s changed). Most expensive movie cost $2 million. Warner’s very first film to break the sound barrier was “The Jazz Singer” starring Al Jolson. Because all other entries were silents, this breakthrough talkie wasn’t allowed to compete.\nThe winners — Charlie Chaplin, Emil Jannings, the lone female Janet Gaynor, age 22 — all managed to grab only one paragraph in Time magazine. Following year, winners were Warner Baxter and Mary Pickford. 1930 Best Picture? “All Quiet on the Western Front.” Norma Shearer, Best Actress. Next year, Lionel Barrymore and Marie Dressler. Then came Helen Hayes, who now has a West 44th Broadway theater in her name.\nWho’d figure? The academy’s good about Oscars for bad reasons. Al Pacino, brilliant in “Serpico” and “The Godfather,” won for hoo-hahing in “Scent of a Woman.” Julia Roberts should’ve won for “Pretty Woman” and “Steel Magnolias” but got it for playing Erin Brockovich. Snubbed for “Thelma & Louise” in ’92, Susan Sarandon grabbed it for “Dead Man Walking” in ’96. It’s humphed that Dame Judi Dench’s rightful win in ’99 for “Shakespeare in Love” made up for blowing it in 1998 for “Mrs. Brown.”\nThe nickname Oscar began in 1939. Many stories as to why the name. One says the academy’s director thought the statuette looked like her Uncle Oscar.\nAlso, imbibe! Monte’s Trattoria, Greenwich Village restaurant — Pietro Mosconi, proprietor (2005 Chef of the Year) does an Oscar dinner. 7 p.m.’s “La La Land” blood-orange vodka cocktail. Four courses plus spirits end with his curried margarita “Lion.” Patrons that sloshed won’t care who-the-hell wins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:22:22.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
