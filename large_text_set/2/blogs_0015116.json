(Katherine Dunn/Baltimore Sun video) \nWestern beats Poly 45-40 in overtime for the Baltimore City Division I girls basketball championship. (Katherine Dunn/Baltimore Sun video) Northwestern (16-1) didn’t start strong Saturday, but made up for it, hitting its stride late in the third quarter and rolling to a 61-36 win over Southwestern at Coppin State. (Katherine Dunn) \nShe said after the game she was fine, but with her on the bench, the Doves had to play some of their best team ball of the game. Naya Delaney started overtime with a three-point play and Destiny Hawkins banked in a short jumper to give the Doves a 41-26 lead 1:30 into the four-minute overtime period. \nPoly's Tylea Galloway cut the lead with a free throw and Jada Gross, who led the Engineers with 10 points, nailed a 3-pointer to pull them within 41-40 with 1:01 to go. But in a game in which the Engineers played a lot of catch-up, they couldn't quite make it all the way back. They didn't manage another shot. \nIn the third quarter, the Engineers led three times, first at 32-28 after Deierra Weems scored back-to-back. Poly turned the ball over on three of its next four possessions and Makayla Pickens fed Kobie Scott-Pearson for a basket, stole the ball and tied the game at 32. \nTownes hit a free throw to push ahead, but Delaney answered with two for a 34-33 Western lead. Free throws from Weems and Cache Wilson gave the Engineers their last lead at 36-34 with 34.1 seconds left in regulation. \nThe Engineers had to rebound from a psychological hole when they didn't hit a field goal until 1:05 remained in the first half. They kept pace from the free-throw line though, hitting 13 of 21 in the half. \nThe victory was the fifth straight for the Doves over their next-door neighbor. They won the regular-season game, 52-42. Poly's last win came in the 2015 City final, which was the Engineers' second straight championship. \nAgainst a Poly team that kept coming back, Western coach Tasha Townsend said she was especially pleased with her team's resilience. \n\"We just didn't give up. We just didn't want to give up,\" Townsend said. \"We came to win and that's what we wanted to do — we wanted to finish it. We just played a little harder [down the stretch]. We just kind of let everything go. We let the girls go, we let the emotions go and we just played.\" \nThe teams will move on to the sectional playoffs later this week with the Doves aiming for a Class 4A state title and the Engineers, who were state finalists last season, in Class 3A. \nP--Wilson 1, Gross 10, Porter 3, Weems 9, Galloway 3, Jones 2, Townes 9, Ayers 3.
