(Photo: David Giesbrecht, Netflix) \nOn the day a real president is inaugurated, there's good news for fans of a fictional commander-in-chief. Netflix's House of Cards and its mesmerizing president, Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey), will return for Season 5 on May 30. \nFriday's premiere announcement surfaced shortly after the inauguration and was accompanied by a foreboding video that features an American flag flying upside down, an official sign of distress. \nNetflix isn't revealing much about the new season of the Emmy-nominated drama, but its announcement offered one key detail: Francis and Claire Underwood (Robin Wright), \"characters (that) have always been each other's strongest allies, show cracks in their relationship.\" \nHouse of Cards also stars Michael Kelly, Jayne Atkinson and Neve Campbell.
