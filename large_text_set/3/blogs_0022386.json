Gizmodo showed off a pic of Ohanian’s profile, which you can see above. \nIt looks very similar to what you’d find on other social media sites, with a profile pic, a banner image, and a list of recent posts. The only unique thing in the picture is a list of communities the poster is active in (as opposed to ones they just follow, one presumes). \nIn reply to a comment on the site asking the motives for the change, admin HideHideHidden says, “We think this will allow some of the best content creators on reddit to stay on reddit and grow.” Reddit has long had strict rules against self-promotion, and until now the only way to post your own content directly was to make a subreddit in your own name. \nReddit hasn’t said if profiles will be available to every user or a select few of these “content creators.” Assuming Ohanian’s profile is the standard, they will be almost a direct mirror of Twitter. If nothing else, it might make communities stronger as the creators can interact directly with fans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:22:09.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
