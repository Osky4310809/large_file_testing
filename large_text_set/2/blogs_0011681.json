Some believe it is a doorway to another world and warn against its use , but most people see it as a harmless diversion, especially if it's not taken too seriously. \nHere are some guidelines. How to Use an Ouija Board \nAn Ouija board is easy to use, but it not's meant to be a solo activity. It takes two to Ouija. Usually, one person is not able to work the Ouija. Get a friend to use it with you. Having a male and a female in the group is usually recommended. Timing. Most practitioners suggest using the board at night when, they say, less interference is in the atmosphere, but you can use it anytime. Create some atmosphere. The Ouija is more fun if you darken the room and light some candles. Turn off the TV and any music to minimize distractions. Have a seat. The two users should sit facing each other, with knees touching if possible, with the board on their laps. Don't use a table. Decide on a questioner or medium. Even though both people can ask questions -- or anyone else in the room can -- only one of the users should be the medium (the one to formally ask questions of the board). \ncontinue reading below our video Using a Ouiji Board Place your fingers on the planchette. You and your partner should place the fingers of both hands very lightly on the planchette, or pointer. Move it. Purposely move the planchette around in a circle on the board for a moment or two to get it \"warmed up.\" Attitude. Don't let the board control the session. The medium should begin by announcing that the session will only allow an experience that is positive or toward a higher good and that negative energies are not welcome. Begin simply . Start with a simple question, one that requires a yes or no answer. Be patient. You might not begin to get answers right away. Give the board a chance to \"warm up.\" Be polite. When the board starts working, thank the board or entities for showing up and communicating with you. Don't ask stupid questions. Avoid questions such as, \"When am I going to die?\" If the board answers, \"in 6 months,\" you might just worry about it needlessly because you cannot always trust the board to tell you the truth. Don't ask for physical signs . Many experienced users warn against asking for physical signs that the \"spirit\" is real or present. Don't believe everything the board tells you. Just as with any other source of information, don't accept whatever the board says to be the truth or accurate. Close the board. This is an important step. When you're done with your session, intentionally slide the planchette to \"Goodbye\" and remove your hands. Tips Have someone write down the answers. Sometimes the letters spell out very quickly and it's difficult to keep track of what's being said. A third person with paper and pen can write down the message as it comes. Play sober. You'll get better results if you haven't been drinking or smoking. Maintain control. If the board starts giving rude, vulgar, obscene or otherwise disagreeable responses, break off the session immediately by closing the board. Don't take it too seriously. Most \"bad\" or negative Ouija experiences occur because the users take it too seriously or get freaked out by it. Don't. Just take it in stride. \nYou can buy \"official\" Ouija boards, but a printable version works just as well. Enter the game with patience and a sense of humor and enjoy a fun activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:23:15.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
