Stop doing that.\" \nWhoa!!!\nRelated: Leslie Fought Back Against Milo!! \nBut her ire wasn't limited to white women, either — and she touches on a lot of aspects of the social unrest and controversies that have erupted following Donald Trump 's presidency.\nFor example, Jones hits on the women's marches and other demonstrations that have taken place all over the country over the last several weeks, but she calls out black women — not white women — here for their (lack of?) participation, in her eyes:\n\"Not one black woman out there. Black woman at home watching [ Real ] Housewives of Atlanta. \" \nAnd she also notes how, while she'd like to fall in love in 2017, she's more prepared for the apocalypse with The Donald manning the White House right now: \n\"I want to be in love. I want to do that, but it's 2017, and we got a pig in office. The world is about to end.\" \nThat last one hopefully doesn't turn out to be too true!\nRelated: More Leslie Jones News HERE! \nBut what do you think about her Black Lives Matter comments, Perezcious readers?! All good because it's within the context of a comedy routine, or did she cross a line in getting too personal towards white women?\nLet us know in the comments (below)!!!\n[ Image via Derrick Salters/ WENN . ] \nTags: black lives matter , controversy , donald trump , leslie jones , media minute , new york , politik , saturday night live , social issues , tech talk , tv news , viral: news", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:09:25.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
