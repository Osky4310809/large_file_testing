Therefore it is with deep regret and reluctance that I am tendering my resignation as deputy First Minister,\" McGuinness said in a statement. \n\"Sinn Fein will not tolerate the arrogance of Arlene Foster and the DUP. We now need an election to allow the people to make their own judgement.\" Undisclosed illness \nMcGuinness, who has recently taken a break from some of his duties because of an undisclosed illness, told the British media that he would say at a later date whether or not he would be well enough to run as a candidate in any election. \nMcGuinness said Sinn Fein would not nominate anyone to fill the vacancy, meaning the power-sharing government will collapse at the latest once the seven days allowed for this elapse. \nIt would then be up to London's Northern Ireland secretary to propose a date for the election. Irish leaders discuss impact of Brexit \nSinn Fein says Foster failed to close down the green energy scheme, which aimed to encourage businesses to burn wood pellets rather than fossil fuels, when it became clear that it was open to abuse. \nThe scheme gave businesses 1.60 pounds for every pound spent. \nFoster says she closed it down as soon as the potential abuse was recognised. \nTension has been growing in recent months in the power-sharing government, created after a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of violence between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists who wanted to join the Republic of Ireland, and allowed border checkpoints to be dismantled. \nUnlike Foster's DUP, Sinn Fein campaigned against Britain leaving the EU, and McGuinness has called for a referendum on Northern Ireland joining the Republic of Ireland to avoid an exit, which could see border checks reinstated. \nOverall, 52 percent of the UK voted in favour of leaving the EU in June's referendum, but 56 percent of those voting in Northern Ireland backed remaining.
