Now, she’s being tipped for the TARDIS.\nBritish bookmakers are placing their bets on the actor to replace Peter Capaldi in this year’s Doctor Who Christmas special.\nLadbrokes’ odds-on favorite to become the next Time Lord (Lady?), Swinton boasts a 7-2 advantage over popular choices Kris Marshall (4-1) and Olivia Colman (5-1).\nIn January, Capaldi confirmed the 2017 Christmas special will mark the end of his time-and-space-traveling tenure. But who will materialize out of the Twelfth Doctor’s fiery rebirth this December?\nPaul McGann, who played the Eighth Doctor in the 1996 TV movie, boldly predicted Swinton late last month, urging Twitter followers to “imagine Capaldi regenerating into” the actress.\nImagine Capaldi regenerating into.. pic.twitter.com/m0OP6bYlEO\n— Paul McGann (@pauljmcgann) January 31, 2017\nPeople have been coming out in droves to support a woman in the lead role, which has been portrayed by 13 men over five decades. Capaldi tipped Frances de la Tour ( Harry Potter , History Boy ), while David Tennant (Tenth Doctor) called Broadchurch co-star Colman “a magnificent choice.”\nEven writer Mark Gatiss agreed : a woman would be “fantastic.”\n“It’s the sort of thing I think would bring an amazing new audience” to the show,” he recently said in a BBC Radio 2 interview. “But who knows, it’s up to [incoming showrunner] Chris Chibnall.”\nThe new boss, however, isn’t in any hurry to cast the titular role. Taking over for Steven Moffat next year, Chibnall is currently focused on the third (and likely final) season of Broadchurch , which returns to the UK’s ITV on Feb. 27 for eight episodes. Then it’s time for a relaxing vacation before hunkering down with Doctor Who .\nYes, Tilda Swinton would bring an amazing energy, vibe, and style to the Doctor (and to the BBC). But don’t get too excited about an androgynous alien: It’s highly improbable the production company A) could afford an Oscar-winning A-lister for a 12-episode arc (or more), and B) would be willing to take on such a big name.\nHistorically, the BBC has cast actors of relative obscurity (especially outside of the UK), who became famous through the role. (There are, of course, exceptions: Capaldi was known in many circles for his turn as the short-tempered Malcolm Tucker in Armando Iannucci’s satire The Thick of It .)\nBookies also have their money on Kris Marshall, known to US audiences as Love Actually ‘s horny Colin Frissell. Around the same time Capaldi dropped his bombshell, Marshall revealed he would step down from the BBC’s Death in Paradise , sparking rumors that the timing is not just a coincidence.\nBen Whishaw (Daniel Craig’s Bond films), Richard Ayoade ( The IT Crowd ), Reece Shearsmith ( Shaun of the Dead ), Rory Kinnear (also Craig’s Bond films), Richard Madden ( Game of Thrones ), David Harewood ( Supergirl ), Idris Elba ( Luther ), and Gwendoline Christie ( Game of Thrones ) are still in the top 20.\nA new star, whoever that may be, is expected to be cast by the fall, ahead of an official proclamation and an on-screen regeneration.", "external_links": ["https://sports.ladbrokes.com/en-gb/betting/tv-and-specials/doctor-who/next-doctor-who/223249169/", "https://twitter.com/pauljmcgann/status/826488884729094144", "https://t.co/m0OP6bYlEO"], "published": "2017-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:44:35.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
