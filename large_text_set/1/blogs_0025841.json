For example, here are those photos of Scott Disick fondling what looks like a teen girl, to me. Here is the video version of those beach photos. Feeling cheeky? Scott Disick hits Miami with a mystery woman To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video And here is the video version of those pool photos. Flirty Scott Disick gets close to mystery brunette in a pool To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nYep, that’s definitely Scott kissing some girl’s neck in a pool. And yep, that girl in the pool definitely does not look a day over 20 years old. (Scott is 33.) \nMeanwhile, 37-year-old Kourtney Kardashian is presumably at home taking care of her and Scott’s three kids. Giphy \nIn case you need a refresher, their oldest son, Mason Disick, is 7 years old. Again, this is all guesswork, but I’m willing to bet that makes Mason about half the age of Scott’s latest conquest. \nWTF SCOTT? I thought you and Kourtney were doing really well! Did that romantic trip to Disneyland together last month mean NOTHING to you? Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick celebrate Mason and Reign's birthdays at Disneyland https://t.co/tCrusHC0xk pic.twitter.com/3J2RYygYM6 \n— Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) December 15, 2016 \nNot to mention the fact that Scott and Kourtney literally just took a family vacation to Costa Rica together . \nLike, he posted that photo on Instagram three days ago! He called Kourtney “Mom!” And then he went off and made out with a child three days later! \nThat’s how you treat your beloved baby mama, Scott? \nSeriously, Scott. Get it together. Your defined and abnormally large penis is no excuse for this kind of behavior. Kourtney deserves so much more. \nAgain, can we kick Scott off “Keeping up with the Kardashians” for this, or…? \nScott is officially out of chances. I don’t want to hear another word from fans who want them to be together ever again. I don’t care if they full on kiss on camera — Kourtney needs to move on. \nThat, or she needs to cut him. Either of these two options will do. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
