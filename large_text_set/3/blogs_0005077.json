Post to Facebook Matt Barnes' trial delayed for Warriors NBA Finals run Barnes faces third-degree assault and obstruction of breathing charges.  //ftw.usatoday.com/2017/03/matt-barnes-assault-trial-charges-warriors-nba-finals   Join the Nation's Conversation   Matt Barnes' trial delayed for Warriors NBA Finals run adicjoseph 6:52 p.m. ET March 4, 2017 \nMatt Barnes joined the Warriors after Kevin Durant's knee injury , but he apparently expects to stick with them for the duration. \nBarnes, the 36-year-old NBA journeyman, still was with the Kings on Dec. 5, when he was involved in a nightclub fight in New York City. He faces charges of third-degree assault and obstruction of breathing for allegedly choking a woman and punching a man at Avenue in Manhattan. (DeMarcus Cousins also was there.) \nBarnes was arraigned Friday, and the New York Post has a pretty remarkable exchange between Barnes' lawyer, Alex Spiro, and the judge: \nJudge Herbert Moses asked Spiro if his client could return to court in mid-June. \nSpiro quipped that Barnes might be unavailable. \n\"I have reason to believe my client will be playing in the NBA Finals,\" he said. \n\"Good luck,\" the judge said before giving Barnes a June 27 return date. \nSure, now try telling them that you've got a big work project the next time you're given jury duty and see how that goes.
