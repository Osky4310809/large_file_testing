She claimed to have been hit in the head by an intruder, the lawsuit said. \nEmily Dearden, who hails form the Upper West Side, remains free on bail after pleading guilty to one count of attempted assault in the first degree, a felony. \nShe faces up to 15 years in prison when she is sentenced on June 7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:19:00.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
