Could   \nA woman who launched a glass at a student on a night out and scarred her for life has been spared prison so she can care for her children. \nLeanne Pinney, 21, suffered severe cuts to the face - including a gash to her forehead - which now serves as a permanent reminder of the violent attack. \nSingle mum-of-seven Joanne Hodson, 33, threw a drink over her victim before she hurled the glass at her face, after getting angry at a group in a pub. \nBut she been spared jail after a judge was told she lives with three of her children, including an autistic six-year-old, and has three others stay at weekends.

It was, as your victim described, a senseless attack.” \nLiverpool Crown Court heard jobless Hodson was on a date at a pub iat around 1am on October 16 last year when the incident took place, the Liverpool Echo reported . \nCCTV showed her stagger across a dance floor and start screaming at a group, before returning to a table where she had left a half pint glass. \nThe victim told the court: “She was extremely angry and a male tried to calm her down. She said ‘f*** off’ and then threw the glass deliberately at my head.” \nFormer bodybuilder to stand trial accused of capturing and killing Britain's rarest butterflies Liverpool Crown Court (Photo: MEN) \nMike Stephenson, prosecuting, said the student felt blood dripping down her face, as “determined” Hodson headed for the exit. \nAnother customer stopped Hodson, who struggled with police, and Ms Pinney was taken to hospital. She needed three stitches for a cut above her right eye and treatment for two other wounds. \nMs Pinney, who missed a week of lectures following the incident, said: “This malicious and senseless attack has knocked my confidence. \n“I have a permanent one-inch scar to my forehead and a smaller scar on the bridge of my nose, which will be a constant reminder.” \nHodson admitted assault causing actual bodily harm. She has two previous convictions for the same offence in 1999 and 2002. \nTom Watson, defending, said she was on medication for depression and had a seriously “troubled childhood”. \nHe said she was “extremely drunk” on the evening of the incident and thought she had been “drenched” with drink, and retaliated. \nMr Watson said: “This was outrageous. She is deeply remorseful and she offers her unreserved apology. She says she will never drink again.” \nHe said Hodson had three children, aged nine, 10 and 11, who live with their dad, and a 16-year-old son. \nMr Watson said: “Her eldest boy went into care when she was 16. She has not seen him since he was 11-months-old.” \nHe said her mum and sister would care for her children if she was jailed, adding: “Although she would be frightened at the prospect of prison, it’s for her children she is most frightened.” \nWoman whose husband tried to murder her with a hammer hopes to continue 'loving' relationship one day \nJudge Aubrey said he had to decide whether to suspend what would otherwise be an “inevitable” prison term. \nThe judge said: “If the court imposes an immediate custodial sentence upon you today, inevitably it will impact upon your three children. You of course should of thought of that.” \nHodson sat with her hands clasped in prayer and burst into tears when the judge handed her 12 months in jail, suspended for two years. \nJudge Aubrey said: “This court intends to restrict your liberty considerably.” \nHe also gave her a six-month home curfew, from 8pm to 6am, 220 hours of unpaid work, a 20-day rehabilitation activity and ordered her to pay £400 in compensation.
