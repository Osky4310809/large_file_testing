Mark Rutte defeated Geert Wilders in the Netherlands election Chris Graham 16 March 2017 • 5:46am \nT he Dutch election on Wednesday had been billed as a litmus test for populism in Europe after last's year British vote to leave the European Union and the election of US President Donald Trump. \nWith centre-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte on course for a resounding victory over anti-Islam and anti-EU Geert Wilders early on Thursday, there was relief from other EU governments facing a wave of nationalism. \nBut there were also warnings that Mr Wilders and the the far-right movement across Europe would not quietly fade away. \n\"It appears that the VVD will be the biggest party in the Netherlands for the third time in a row,\" Mr Rutte told cheering supporters at a post-election party in The Hague. \"Tonight we'll celebrate a little.\" Dutch general election results 2017 | Parliament seats per party \nW ith 55 percent of votes counted, Mr Rutte's VVD Party was projected to win 32 of parliament's 150 seats, down from 41 at the last vote in 2012. Mr Wilders was in a three-way tie for second on 19 seats with the Christian Democrat CDA and centrist Democrats 66, data provided by the ANP news agency showed. \nRelieved European leaders were quick to congratulate Mr Rutte as the results emerged. \n\"It is also an evening in which the Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said 'stop' to the wrong kind of populism,\" he said. Why did Rutte win? \nMr Rutte, who for much of the campaign appeared to be racing to keep pace with Mr Wilders, may have profited from the hard line he drew in a diplomatic standoff with Turkey over the past week . \nT he fight erupted over the Netherlands' refusal to let two Turkish government ministers address rallies in Rotterdam about a referendum that could give Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan more powers. It gave Mr Rutte an opportunity to refuse to bow to foreign pressure, a stance with widespread backing in the nation.

The first gains are made,” Mr Wilders said on Twitter.
