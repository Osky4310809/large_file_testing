Dating back to Feb. 24, 2016, Westbrook’s averages are 28.3 points, 10.5 assists, 10.0 rebounds.\nThe dynamic MVP candidate is also still averaging a triple-double for this season — in 57 games played, he’s at 31.1 points, 10.5 rebounds and 10.1 assists. However, this is the first time that we’ve been able to add the end of Westbrook’s season last year — the final 25 games — to his tally this season. Add it all together, and it’s a triple-double.\nAt this point, Westbrook seems more likely than not to become the second player ever to average a triple-double for the season, following Oscar Robertson back in the 1961-62 season. However, even if he does fall slightly short, we know that he was able to do it for at least an 82-game stretch, albeit with an offseason in the middle.\nWestbrook pushed himself over the mark with 17 points, 18 rebounds and 17 assists against the Lakers on Friday. The rebounds, in particular, he needed to achieve this particular statistical feat — the 18 gave him exactly 820 over his last 82 games.\nFor just this season, Westbrook’s currently more in danger of losing the 10 assists per game average, given he’s only averaging 10.1 assists per game. However, the Thunder ’s trade deadline addition of Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott could change that. McDermott instantly becomes the best shooter on the team while Gibson is a very effective scorer in multiple ways who should benefit greatly from Westbrook.\nUltimately, no one will remember this 82-game sample like they will if Westbrook does or doesn’t average it over a year. Still, it’s worth marveling briefly at how incredible this feat really is for Westbrook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:55:10.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
