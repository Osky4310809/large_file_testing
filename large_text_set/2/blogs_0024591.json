A Beginner's Guide to Estate Jewelry Johner Images/Getty Images Updated November 08, 2015 . What is Estate Jewelry and How Does That Differ From Antique and Vintage Jewelry? \nThe terms antique, vintage, and estate are used to help date older pieces of fine jewelry. So what then makes a piece of jewelry antique? This is one of the most common questions in the antique jewelry industry, and the answer varies from how we would classify cars or houses. All jewelry that is not brand new is technically considered estate, but not all estate jewelry is considered vintage. Just like all antique jewelry is considered vintage, yet not all vintage jewelry is considered antique. Confusing? Check out this timeline chart for further clarification. \nDo remember though that sometimes the use of the terms “vintage” or “estate” can be misleading, so it is very important to understand how reputable dealers use these terms and how unreliable dealers use them so you can avoid accidentally buying a reproduction . For instance, it wouldn't make sense to call a 300-year-old cameo an “estate cameo” even though it technically is. Instead a reliable dealer would only use the words “antique cameo” to avoid any confusion. An unreliable dealer might call a brand new reproduction cameo that looks very much like the 300-year-old cameo an “estate cameo” to make the uneducated customer believe the cameo is much older than it actually is. Estate Jewelry \nEstate jewelry is any piece of jewelry that is second hand. This jewelry can be considered either antique, vintage or estate. Say you got engaged four years ago with a brand new diamond ring, but you decided to call off the wedding. Last week you finally sold your ring to a jeweler. The jeweler would classify this ring as estate . Instead of describing every single piece of used jewelry as estate, dealers generally limit this term to jewelry that was made within the last 30 years. Anytime this term is used to describe a piece of jewelry that may look like it's much older than this, inquire to verify the exact age with the seller. Sometimes the use of the term “estate” can be a reproduction indicator as mentioned above. It is safe to assume that whenever a dealer says “estate” without any other mention to the item's age, that piece of jewelry is not very old at all. \nJewelry Eras Included in Estate Jewelry: Contemporary Vintage Jewelry \nFor a piece of fine jewelry to be considered vintage, it has to be at least 20 to 30 years old, so anything from the 1980's and earlier. Vintage is probably the most common term of the three since it encompasses a large collection of jewelry ages. Would an engagement ring from the 1800's be considered vintage? Technically speaking, yes. Although instead of classifying the ring as vintage , most dealers would call the ring antique so they can highlight just how old the ring is. Is your grandmother's engagement ring from the 1940's? That would be considered a vintage engagement ring. \nJewelry Eras Included in Vintage Jewelry: Modern, Mid Century Modern, Retro, Art Deco Antique Jewelry \nAntique jewelry is any piece of jewelry that is about 100 years old or older. Many pieces from the 1920's are now considered antique, especially those made in the earlier part of the decade. When an item is called “antique” by a reliable dealer, you can rest assured that the heirloom is very old. However, beware of the term “antique style” which is another reproduction indicator. Anytime the word “style” is used when describing a piece of jewelry that appears to be old but there is no other mention to the item's age, this most likely means the item is a reproduction. \nJewelry Eras Included in Antique Jewelry: Art Deco , Edwardian, Belle Epoque, Art Nouveau , Victorian , Georgian , & Earlier \nStill not sure how to describe your used piece of jewelry? \nThese three terms are only the beginning when it comes to dating a piece of heirloom jewelry. One of the most important factors when dating jewelry is the era or period that the piece is attributed to.
