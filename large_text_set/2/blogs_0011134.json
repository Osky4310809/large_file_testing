In addition to the Ingenium diesel which produces 240 PS and 500 Nm in the Range Rover Sport, Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport , the Ingenium engine range now features petrol variants in two guises, a 200 PS version and another with 250 PS; both petrol and diesel powerplants are 2.0 litre inline-fours. \nWhen the new petrol duo make their debuts, they will be distinguished by 20t and 25t badging for the 200 PS and 250 PS versions, respectively; new Jaguar models installed with the new, twin-turbo Ingenium diesel engine will be given the 25d model designation. The new Ingenium petrol engines will replace the current, Ford EcoBoost mills. \nThe Jaguar Land Rover range of Ingenium engines have “the technologies to deliver exceptional performance, efficiency and refinement while meeting the most stringent global emissions regulations,” according to the company, with the petrol units deploying twin scroll turbos for turbo lag reduction, while optimising output and efficiency, it adds. \nBoth the 200 PS and 250 PS petrol engines feature electrohydraulic valve control, which provides fully variable control of intake valve lift to optimise efficiency, power and torque across the rev range, says JLR. A new combustion system incorporates a 200 bar direct fuel injection system, with centrally-mounted injectors providing optimised spray patterns for cleaner combustion and therefore reduced emissions. \nWith the new Ingenium engines, the exhaust manifold is also integrated into the cylinder head casting, a Jaguar first. Coolant is passed through the manifold for considerably reduced warm-up times, for further improvement in fuel consumption and emissions. \nThe updated F-Pace also receives a new 163 PS/380 Nm 2.0 litre Ingenium diesel, paired with a manual gearbox and rear-wheel drive. configured thus, the F-Pace gets the E-Performance badge for its fuel consumption rating of 4.8L/100 km. The existing 180 PS Ingenium diesel also gets paired with an automatic RWD driveline for the 2018 model year update, with fuel consumption and CO2 emissions rated at 5.1L/100 km and 134 g/km respectively. \nThe aforementioned top diesel with 240 PS and 500 Nm is paired with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive, attaining CO2 emissions of 153 g/km, fuel consumption of 5.8L/100 km and a 0-100 km/h time of 7.2 seconds. The range-topping 250 PS/365 Nm Ingenium petrol engine is also paired with an automatic, AWD drivetrain, driving the F-Pace from 0-100 km/h 6.8 seconds, with CO2 emissions and fuel consumption rated at 170 g/km and 7.4L/100 km respectively. \nOnwards to the updated XF; when specified with the 200 PS Ingenium petrol engine, the mid-sized sports sedan attains the 0-100 km/h benchmark in 7.5 seconds, with fuel consumption and CO2 emissions rated at 6.8 L/100 km and 154 g/km respectively. When configured with the 250 PS Ingenium petrol, the XF gets a choice of RWD and AWD drivelines. \nThe 250 PS, RWD variant matches the 200 PS model for efficiency, while achieving 0-100 km/h in 6.6 seconds, according to Jaguar. Meanwhile, the AWD variant matches RWD the performance claims with CO2 emissions rated at 159 g/km. \nDiesel-wise, the 240 PS variant of the Ingenium diesel joins the existing 163 PS and 180 PS duo. Also available with both AWD and RWD, the top diesel XF attains 5.3 L/100 km and 5.5 L/100 km, with CO2 emissions of 139 g/km and 144 g/km respectively. For both variants, 0-100 km/h is said to be reached in 6.5 seconds. \nWith the updated XE compact sports sedan, the 200 PS/320 Nm, 2.0 litre Ingenium petrol propels the car from 0-100 km/h in 7.1 seconds, with fuel consumption and CO2 emissions rated at 6.3 L/100 km and 144 g/km respectively. The 250 PS variant delivers identical consumption and emissions ratings, but with a 0-100 km/h time of 6.3 seconds; the 250 PS, AWD variant does the sprint in 6.2 seconds, with CO2 emissions rated at 154 g/km. \nWhen paired with the 240 PS/500 Nm twin-turbo Ingenium diesel, the updated XE does 0-100 km/h in 6.1 seconds, with CO2 emissions of 137 g/km and fuel consumption rated at 5.2 L/100 km. \nBeyond the new powertrain, Jaguar has also updated the XE and XF in terms of a customisable driving experience, via the Configurable Dynamics function. Now a standalone feature, the setup allows drivers to configure the car’s engine, gearbox and steering settings with Normal or Dynamic settings. \nThe chosen setup is then called up by engaging Dynamic mode via the chequered flag button on the central console. Adaptive Dynamics adds configurable suspension settings to the mix, and is integrated with the Configurable Dynamics system for an all-round customisable driving setup. \nThe 2018 model year also brings updates to the cars’ interiors. Starting with the seats, the front perches in the F-Pace and the XF now feature winged headrests, which have powered height adjustment with manually adjustable side wing supports. \nOn the infotainment front, the XE, XF and F-Pace gain Dual View technology which the driver and front passenger to each view different displays from the same central 10-inch touchscreen display. With the optional Touch Pro specified, the setup lets the driver follow satellite navigation instructions, while the front passenger can view video playback on the same screen from USB or TV channels; Touch Pro also brings a 12.3-inch TFT screen for the driver. \nNew active safety equipment also appears with the updated XE, XF and F-Pace trio. Forward Traffic Detection aims to assist when forward visibility is restricted, with the aid of the forward-facing camera in the grille which detects items crossing the vehicle’s path, and the system displays a visual warning on the central screen when the potential hazard is detected. \nMeanwhile, Forward Vehicle Guidance helps the driver place the vehicle when making tight manoeuvres. The vehicle’s front parking sensors work with the sensors providing wheel projections for the alignment of steering, offering a visual representation of the vehicle relative to possible manoeuvres. \nFor added safety during lane changes, the updated XE and XF pairs the existing Blind Spot Monitor system with assistance from the electric power steering setup; if the Blind Spot Monitor detects a vehicle in or approaching the Jaguar’s blind spot when it is changing lanes, it will apply a gentle steering force to keep itself within the lane, to try and avoid potential collisions. \nThe updated XE gains autonomous emergency braking with pedestrian detection, which operates from 5-60 km/h. Hazards are detected with the forward-facing camera, and applies the brakes when it detects a collision risk; the system is able to detect pedestrians in front of the vehicles, which are upwards of 1m tall. \nPayment for fuel is also given a step up in convenience with updated XE, XF and F-Pace. Initially for the United Kingdom and subsequently for the rest of the global market, owners of the new Jaguars install the Shell mobile app which lets the driver select the amount of fuel required and pay via PayPal, Apple Pay and later this year, Android Pay. This allows fuel transactions to be made before the driver leaves the vehicle.
