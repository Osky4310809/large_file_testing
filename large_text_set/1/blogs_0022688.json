I like their style of play, up-tempo.” ... \nSt. Frances girls basketball senior Mia Davis, an All-Metro first-team forward and powerful rebounder, committed Wednesday to play for Temple . \n“I had a good relationship with the coaching staff,” Davis said. “I like the academic part, and it was a good fit for me. I like their style of play, up-tempo.” ... (Katherine Dunn) \n\"To me, it's the way she rebounds and rebounding to me is a mentality,\" Roland Park coach Scott Buckley said. \"She has good position but more than that, she likes to go after the ball. There are a lot of rebounders who wait for the ball to come to them, but she doesn't. What makes St. Frances better is that they can take some chances on the offensive end and Mia can make up for some mistakes and give them second and third chances.\" \nDavis, who has signed to play for Temple, has 1,629 career points and more than 1,000 rebounds. \nThis winter, she averages 14.9 points and 7.7 rebounds for the No. 1 Panthers, who are 19-0 and ranked No. 14 nationally in the MaxPreps Xcellent 25. With a balanced team, her stats aren't overwhelming, but she will take over when the game is close. She has been a regular Most Valuable Player or all-tournament team selection from Washington, D.C., to New York as the Panthers have played in several high-caliber tournaments each year. \nDavis, who turned 18 earlier this month, didn't even play basketball until fifth grade. Although she's the sixth of seven children and lives in the basketball hotbed of East Baltimore, no one else in her family played. Her brother, Carlos, also a senior and just 10 months younger, is Mervo's quarterback. \nWhitten spotted her natural ability in a March Madness one-on-one competition he organized at her school, Dr. Rayner Browne Academy, where he was an administrator and the middle school girls basketball coach. \n\"She blew everyone out of the water without really knowing how to play,\" Whitten said. \"My middle school team was like, 'Coach, we need to get her,' and that was the start of it.\" Mia Davis Jen Rynda / Baltimore Sun Media Group \nSt. Frances' Mia Davis, left, and Roland Park's Anna Hauser, right, battle for the ball during the girls basketball game at Roland Park Country School in Baltimore on Saturday, Jan. 2, 2016. \nSt. Frances' Mia Davis, left, and Roland Park's Anna Hauser, right, battle for the ball during the girls basketball game at Roland Park Country School in Baltimore on Saturday, Jan. 2, 2016. (Jen Rynda / Baltimore Sun Media Group) \nThat summer, Davis joined Whitten's sixth-grade Baltimore Starz Amateur Athletic Union team. Extremely coachable and a quick study, she excelled with and against older players right away — especially at rebounding. \n\"Back in middle school, I was the tallest thing out there,\" Davis said with a laugh, \"so my first job was to rebound — other than score — so I would only know, 'Rebound, pick the ball back up, rebound, pass it to a guard.' So, rebounding was my first instinct. I always was aggressive.\" \nHer best friend, Roland Park guard Jeydah Johnson, has seen that in Davis since they began playing together for the Starz. \n\"There is a nice side of Mia, but on the court, she just has so much hunger in her,\" Johnson said. \"Each game is very important to her, so she just works hard to go get it each time. Her goal for each game is to win, win, win.\" \nBy the time she was in eighth grade, Davis began to think basketball might pay for college. She started working with a trainer and soaking up all the knowledge and help her coaches could provide. \nOn a young AAU team after eighth grade, she asked to run the point and Whitten let her. Since then, she has enjoyed adding new dimensions to her game. \n\"I like being the girl who can dribble, shoot, play the outside, play the inside, bring up the ball,\" Davis said. \"I just like doing everything.\" \nTransitioning from high school to college basketball, those skills will come in handy as she moves to small forward, where she can use all of her inside-outside skills. For the past few summers, she has worked on that transition during AAU season — now with the Maryland Lady Shooting Stars, who don't need her to be the post presence the Panthers do. \nSt. Frances coach Jerome Shelton has also given her the chance to work more on the outside, but she's so dominant inside that he can't afford to keep her on the wing all the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:00:41.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
