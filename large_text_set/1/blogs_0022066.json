Trump is planning to sign executive orders on Wednesday that will enable the construction of his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. It will be one part of his executive actions on domestic immigration security that he is said to roll out this week. The POTUS is expected to speak to a town hall of employees at the Department of Homeland Security’s headquarters in Washington tomorrow. \nBig day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 \n\n“Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday evening. “Among many other things, we will build the wall!”\nDuring the week, President Trump will introduce his new domestic immigration initiatives to tighten border security. He is expected to crack down on sanctuary cities as well as implement at least a four-month restriction on refugees and some visa holders coming from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Residents from many of these nations are already rarely granted U.S. visas.\nThe measures are ones that President Trump promised during the campaign trail on his way to the White House. \n[ FoxNews ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T05:45:50.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
