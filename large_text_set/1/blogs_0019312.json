The Secret Service did not verify the alleged investigation to the Daily Mail, instead declining to comment.\nSnap told BuzzFeed News that publishers maintain editorial independence once they are accepted as a partner, so the company doesn’t see content before it is published. But it said it follows up with publishers if users raise questions about their sourcing, accuracy, or other factors. The company declined to speculate on what it would take for a piece of content to be removed or for a publishing partnership to be discontinued.\nSnapchat’s move against dubious and exaggerated content comes at a time when Facebook and Twitter have faced sharp criticism over their unwillingness to fight the scams and fake news that proliferate on their platforms. Snap has managed to largely sidestep those debates , in part because of the tight control it’s always exercised over the Discover section. (BuzzFeed has partnered with Snapchat Discover for content distribution.)\nSnapchat still faced a lawsuit in July 2016 alleging that, via Discover, it was “currently engaged in an insidious pattern and practice of intentionally exposing minors to harmful, offensive, prurient, and sexually offensive content, without warning minors or their parents” and that it “placed profit from monetizing Snapchat Discover over the safety of children.” The lawsuit was settled out of court, according to the Times.\nEven before the new guidelines, the company already required that images and headlines in Discover be appropriate for users as young as 13. More than 100 million people view content in the Discover channels each month, according to the New York Times .\nFacebook and Twitter have defended themselves against criticisms over fake news, harassment, and scams by claiming that they are content-agnostic tech platforms . Snap has taken an opposite tack, describing itself as “a publishing platform, built on values of providing Snapchatters with content that informs and entertains, from authoritative and credible media partners.” Those partners, Snap said, earn the community’s trust through “substantial, sourced and rewarding content.”\n“We take the responsibility of being a source of news, entertainment and information for our community,” the company told BuzzFeed News.", "external_links": ["http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/01/organizer-dc-womens-march-trump-pictured-flashing-isis-sign/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/technology/snapchat-discover-takes-a-hard-line-on-misleading-and-explicit-images.html", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/01/trump-mattis-take-fight-isis-bomb-isis-31-times-day-1-video/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4142950/Thousands-women-head-Washington-protest-Trump.html", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/01/secret-service-aware-madonnas-blow-white-house-comment/"], "published": "2017-01-24T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:35:45.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
