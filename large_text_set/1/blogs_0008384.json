Upon first glance, one might mistake him for a child with dementia; or perhaps they might even look at him as mentally challenged. What is definite however, is that he can't help it, as evidenced by his apparently slow grasp of things in the world around him, his difficulty in studying, and his sporadic speech impediments. It is shown in Moms I'd Like to Forget , that he was a normal, well functioning baby, until he was dropped on his head by his father. His unique manner of speech is often the source of the character's trademark random quotes, where Ralph may make a comment such as \"What's a battle?\", \"It tastes like... burning!\", or \" Mr. Flanders , you're blindeded!,\" as well as his tendency to call his teacher \"School Mommy\" and on one occasion calling Superintendent Chalmers \"Super Nintendo Chalmers.\" He appears to have several talents. He is an incredible tap dancer and played the role of George Washington in the school play. As Washington, he not only recited his lines perfectly but also managed to play the role so well that he brought the audience to tears. [1] In Season 2 (or Season 3 ), he seems not to be having speech impediments, and learning disabilities. He is in his first year of second grade. He's also shown to be able to drive his father's police car. \nRalph Wiggum is often seen in very awkward situations such as eating paste, crayons, worms, clay, knobs, lamps, and the Easter bunny, and other such erratic forms of behavior that have since become a staple of the character. Ralph has a rather immense imagination, and is seemingly oblivious to the world around him. As such, he is generally a cheerful boy. However, Ralph also has a hint of tragedy and dark satire to him, like almost every other character on the show. Throughout the show's history, Ralph is eternally the odd one out among his peers at school. He has connections because his father is Chief of Police. Ralph seems to generally get along with many people, as well as occasionally irritate and baffle them. After Lisa gave him a Valentine out of pity, Ralph developed a crush on her. Lisa publicly breaks up with him and Ralph is left devastated. The pair eventually become friends and Lisa has generally been nice toward him since. [2] Bart is rather long suffering of Ralph. On one occasion, Bart is forced by his mother Marge to play with Ralph. He is at first bored with Ralph but ends up having fun after they steal Clancy Wiggum's master key to the city, and Bart eventually admits that Ralph is a friend. [3] He is also Bart's \"last resource\" friend for when nobody else would spend time with him. [4] Ralph's relationship with his parents seems to be loving and affectionate. Clancy, in particular, rather adores his son as the two do much together, such as various road trips or Ralph's first trip to a major league baseball game. [5] Ralph can be quite a handful, however, and there are times where Clancy can be neglectful of his son as well. His favorite food is school supplies. Ralph has a multitude of imaginary friends such as Wiggle Puppy and a pyromaniacal leprechaun being particularly well known among viewers. Ralph's teacher, Miss Hoover , is indifferent to his personality and his imagination. Though she will often correct him in a dull, condescending manner, (\"The children are right to laugh at you, Ralph,\" she tells him at one point) she has yet to outright scold him. This could be because, as he told his father, she is \"tired of trying,\" [6] as he usually misses the point. \nRalph once signed up for the Auntie Ovenfresh Bakeoff but his Grilled Crayon Sandwich with Thumbtacks was rejected by the contest. \nRalph was also part of a rather infamous hoax where Homer , Skinner , Apu , Lenny , Carl , Chief Wiggum and others had become so fed-up with the whole issue of voting early for the election that they decided to cast all of their votes to someone who was not only unbelievably small, but also so young and unbelievably unintelligent it would be impossible for him to be considered a candidate (and they ultimately chose Ralph). Ironically, Lisa discovers that Ralph is not only aware of what being nominated means, but is also taking the idea of being elected very seriously. Using his childish behavior, he intentionally manipulated the Republican and Democratic parties to join forces in their support of him. [7] Ralph Wiggum is best at sleeping and acting. Typical Behavior Edit \nDuring class, Ralph's teacher Miss Hoover will stop lecturing the class for a moment to question Ralph's actions such as eating something he shouldn't, or saying something bizarre or oblivious. Another common 'Ralph' moment is him being at a major event, and saying something to either perplex everyone present with its insight, or point out something so glaringly obvious it's funny. Ralph has quite a knack for getting himself into sticky situations as well. Examples of Ralph moments include him gorging himself with chocolate, [8] being profiled by a scary dentist, [9] pretending to be a firetruck, saying that he is afraid of chicken legs, [10] pretending he is an imaginary puppy (see This Little Wiggy ). When Bart was skateboarding naked, saying \"I like men now\", [11] and proclaiming that he will attend \"Bovine University\". [12] He has been shown wetting himself in public. [13] Similarly, in the future, he can be seen talking to a classmate by the punch bowl, saying \"I can use the potty now.\" [14] At one point, during a contest for children regarding making a future Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , after Mr. Burns bluntly told him \"Thank you, get out!\" when Ralph's \"project\" (which was a Malibu dream house with the word \"nuclear power plant\" replacing dream house), he stood at the stage blankly staring at the present audience, and only moved to get off the stage with his project after his father yelled from the crowd \"Uh, Ralphie? Get off the stage, sweetheart!\" Also, in a moment when Skinner was looking at the building sadly and remembering touching moments with kids saying things like \"I know how to read\" and \"thank you, Principal Skinner,\" Ralph's distinctive voice saying \"Principal Skinner, I got carsick in your office\", is heard. [15] His usual traits were also referenced in the cover of an article for TV-Guide, where Ralph Wiggum was the only one to remain focused on smiling for a group photograph with most of Springfield's cast, when the others, even his father, ended up distracted by Bart Simpson streaking past the group. This seems to have subsided a little recently, although appearances by Ralph himself have been lighter. Ralph has also demonstrated signs at being borderline psychotic, as he has stated that there is a rock in his yard, where he saw a leprechaun, who told him to burn things. When he later helps save the Mayor of Springfield with Bart and Lisa, the leprechaun appears and tells him, \"You've done grand laddie. Now you know what you have to do? Burn the house down! Burn them all!\" with Ralph smiling vacantly and nodding in agreement. [16] Friends Edit Ralph has been shown with different children all the time. One time Bart stood up for him to the bullies and befriended him, [17] but most of the time he isn't bullied. He is more commonly shown with the rest of the second Ralph with Bart Simpson grade class: rolling down hills and climbing trees. \nLisa is also one of Ralph's friends, and was once his so-called girlfriend, but that ended when Lisa said that she didn't really love him. Ralph asks Lisa for test answers now. Romances Edit \nRalph has had many romances throughout the series. In \" I Love Lisa \" Ralph dates Lisa Simpson; later Lisa publicly breaks up with him and in the end they are just friends. In \" See Homer Run \" he is seen with Terri , playing with her and Lewis in a swimming suit with a water cannon in mid June. His future wife is possibly Lisa, although she would have had a romance with Milhouse. Ralph also \"came out\" during the Simpsons Movie , however this was not followed up. Non Canon Appearance Edit The contents of this article or section are considered to be non-canon and therefore may not have actually happened/existed. \nIn the episode Lisa's Wedding , he becomes one of Krusty's sideshows but is arrested. [18] In the episode Holidays of Future Passed there are many clones of him including two chiefs, a truck driver and burning clone of him. The first clone told Bart that he died and he was turned into a clone. In the episode Days of Future Future , a future version of Ralph appears to be a police officer like his father. Similar to Holidays of Future Passed. Death \nIt is shown in Simpsorama, Ralph's grave said 2006-2017, meaning a rumor of Ralph getting killed off in 2017 is out. This may have happened in Orange is the New Yellow , when he was taken away by a bobcat. The Simpsons Road Rage \nRalph Wiggum appears as both a driver and a potential passenger The Simpsons Hit and Run Edit \nRalph Wiggum is a character in the game. He plays a slightly major role in Level 2, where he acted as the third person Bart can buy illegal fireworks from. Based on his comment to Bart just before giving him the fireworks (\"My daddy's going to put you in jail, bye!\") and Chief Wiggum proceeding to give chase to Bart with the threat of having Bart serve five life sentences of Community Service for the purchase of illegal fireworks, he may have been used by his father in a sting operation against any potential sales of Illegal Fireworks. Aside from this, Ralph also appears in every level but the final one as a Springfield DMV referee for street races, always acting as the third one (he is absent from the final level alongside the other two judges because of zombies taking over their positions). Unlike the other judges (Milhouse and Nelson), it was never made clear why he was hired by Selma and Patty Bouvier to act as a judge, although his exchange with Lisa in the third level implies that his father arranged for the two to hire him as punishment for presumably acting out at the hardware store. In the fifth level, both Apu and Ralph implied that they had been involved in an incident where Ralph nearly managed to somehow drown himself in nacho cheese, and that the event was notable enough to cause newspaper headlines. The Simpsons Game Edit \nIn the PS3 and X360 versions, Ralph is an enemy in Mob Rules . Ralph later appears along with Rod and Todd Flanders as Hobbit-like children who help Homer and Marge defeat the two-headed dragon in order to get the keycard. [19] He also appears as a holder of one of the three Sparklemon that Homer and Lisa must defeat. [20] At the end of the game, he is seen watching the closing moments of the Simpsons family talking with God , then he sees the player and says \"Daddy... someone's looking at me.\" Quotes Why do people run from me? (wets pants) (Talking to Ned Flanders) Normal is an illusory state, the only constant is change. (Presenting an award) When I grow up, I wanna be a principal or a caterpillar. (Walking near him) Ice-cream tastes like melting. (To Bart) This is my sandbox . Over there is the deep end, I'm not allowed to go in there. That's where I see the leprechaun, he tells me to burn things. (To Lisa) You ruined the video game, and I ruined my pants. (To Lisa) I can't believe I used to go out with you! Me fail English? That's unpossible! (To Vicki Valentine) My daddy shoots people! Miss Hoover, I glued my head to my shoulder. (To Miss Hoover) Can you open my milk, Mommy? (To Miss Hoover) My worm entered my mouth and I ate it. Can I have another one? My cat's breath smells like cat food. I eated the purple berries. (groaning in pain) Bart: How are they, Ralph? Good? Ralph: They taste like... burning. (After a dam breaks and floods the city) I think I wet the bed. Look Daddy, I made a Ralphwich! It tastes hurty. (To Lisa) Hi Liar. (Future Ralph) I got cloneded. (Other Ralph clone after watching one die) That Ralph was stupid. All my friends have birthdays this year. I don't have a red crayon. Miss Hoover: Why not? Ralph: I ate it. I'm a furniture.
