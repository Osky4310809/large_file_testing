Here are some of our favorite Pathfinders from the PC Gamer community, whether they be well crafted or just very weird. Flip through the gallery below to see them all. Image 1 of 12 Bonnie Lass — This is one the better submissions we got, complete with a matching Ryder twin. I really like the subtle sci-fi stylings and not horrifying eyes. Image 2 of 12 Linda — Seriously, there are some horrifying eyes in Andromeda. This is a really nicely made face, but damn if it isn't creepy in game. Image 3 of 12 Keith Valdez — I'm not sure if I could stomach playing all of Andromeda looking like that. It's a good looking base, but this Ryder seems to have had an adverse reaction to cryo-sleep. Image 4 of 12 00bruce — This Ryder stands out to me because it's one of the tinier faces I've seen made. Image 5 of 12 Freiya — I think this player was channeling Storm from X-Men a bit, but it's a cool looking character regardless. Image 6 of 12 Bombstar10 — Across all the Ryders I've seen, there's been a distinct lack of space beards. Good on Bombstar 10 for moving their hair from the head to the chin. Image 7 of 12 Stplaz — It's easy to overdue the colors and make-up provided in Andromeda, but this Ryder has just a subtle splash of purple to remind us we're in the future...or something like that. Image 8 of 12 Kelly Stoops — Speaking of subtle splashes of color, here we have the before and after effects of long term space travel. He starts as a regular, if rather skeletal looking Joe, and ends in a clown troupe with a black eye. Andromeda is a rough place. Image 9 of 12 Kytkat — Getting back to reality, this player has managed to put together a simple and clean looking character without any terrible affectations—a task easier said than done in this game. Image 10 of 12 Withnail — A lot of the time an Andromeda character can look great in the editor but terrible in the light of the game world. That's not the case here, as Withnail's Ryder is probably when of the best looking in-game I've seen yet. The blue hair aside, the eyes aren't bulging and the face looks a step above nearly all the presets. Image 11 of 12 GXIII — Seriously though, what's with all the eyes bulging? A nice, sharp-faced character spoiled slightly be the game making her look like she's trying to shoot lasers from her eyes. Image 12 of 12 Rie Daerien — And to close it out, another classic, solid Ryder. These are harder to find than you might imagine, so it's worth highlighting the normal as much as the exceptional.
