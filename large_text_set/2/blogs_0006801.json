The deal comes with an invitation to spring training for Pena, who previously played in Kansas City from 2009-12. \nPena, 35, had been sitting on the free agent market since the Cardinals released him Nov. 28. In doing so, the Redbirds had to eat the remaining $2.5MM left on the two-year, $5MM deal they awarded Pena in free agency last offseason. Lingering knee issues weighed down Pena during his stint in St. Louis, where he collected just 14 plate appearances. \nAs a member of the Royals, Tigers and Reds from 2009-15, the switch-hitter batted .262/.303/.355 in 1,805 plate appearances. Defensively, Baseball Prospectus has given Pena positive overall grades as a pitch framer, though he has fallen into the negatives in recent seasons. Pena has also thrown out 28 percent of attempted base stealers during his career – just above the 27 percent league-average mark. \nBarring injuries, Pena is unlikely to see much major league action with Kansas City this season. The Royals’ starting catcher is eminently durable standout Salvador Perez , who has played at least 138 games in four straight seasons, and they gave backup Drew Butera a guaranteed $3.8MM in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:11:04.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
