The handset has recently been selling on Amazon for $325 , which would net you a saving of $75, though Best Buy states that regular price is currently pegged at $399.\nThe black variant appears to have sold out already, however the unlocked White and Bamboo versions are still in stock as of the time of publication.\nIn case you’ve missed it, the Moto X Pure was released in September 2015 and comes with a 5.7-inch QHD display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor (@1.8 GHz) and 3 GB of RAM. There’s also a 5 MP camera on the front, 21 MP at the rear and a 3,000 mAh battery under the hood.\nBuy Now: Moto X Pure 64 GB (White) – $249.99 Buy Now: Moto X Pure 64 GB (Bamboo) – $249.99 In our Moto X Pure review from the end of 2015, we had plenty of good things to say about it, giving it an 8.7/10 rating and an Editors Choice award.\nIf you’re interested in picking it up now, just be aware that it arrived with Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, so don’t expect to see it upgraded past Android Nougat . Also note that it lacks a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C connector, if you’re into that sort of thing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T19:06:27.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
