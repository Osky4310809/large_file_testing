While we knew the A-lister struggled quite a bit following her robbery, we got a first hand look at how the Kardashians handled Keeks' trauma during Sunday night's episode of KUWTK .\nRelated: The Kardashians Make A Ton For Their Instagram Ads \nIn fact, this is the first time Mrs. West has gone into detail about what went down that fateful night. The episode started off with Kim's husband, Kanye West performing Heartless while in NYC for his Saint Pablo tour and, as we previously reported , the rapper cut the concert short upon learning of his wife's robbery.\nKourtney Kardashian , who was in Paris with Kim, was the first family member to utter specifics about the night during her confessional. On how she learned about the robbery, Kourt explained: \n\"At 3 in the morning I was at the night club and I got a text. Kim called me from Simone's phone seconds later screaming for help on the top of her lungs.\"\nObviously, Kim's momager, Kris Jenner , was shaken up by the whole situation as she told the E! cameras:\n\"Being woken up in the middle of the night with that call was probably one of the worst nights of my life. I was talking to her, I was trying to wake everybody up, throwing on sweats, being frantically upset and in shock. When I pulled up to her hotel, I just remember throwing my arms around Kim and thinking, ‘She's alive.' We were all so traumatized that we left Paris before the sun came up.\"\nWhat a scary situation. The episode also documented the mother-of-two's return to the states, where she emotionally reunited with her husband and children. We're honestly so impressed with how strong Kim remained for the sake of her children.\nThe businesswoman told Kanye at one point:\n\"I don't want to cry in front of the kids. I don't want them to be scared.\"\nAs for Yeezus, he was rightfully enraged about what happened to the love of his life. He even noted:\n\"If anything would of happened to you, I wouldn't stop until they were dead.\"\nAnd you know what, we believe him. Thankfully, the 36-year-old had her mother and family to lean on during such a trying time. During their flight home, Kim revealed she was feeling \"drained\" from everything.\nMomma Jenner was quick to note that she was probably in \"shock\" and relayed amid a confessional:\n\"You can't begin to explain the emotions running through your mind when you get that hysterical phone call from one of your children because she had just been assaulted. I was numb and the only thing I could think of was, bring a blanket.\"\nThere's no right way to handle this situation. How could they even prepare for something this awful?\nRelated: Kendall Jenner Has Been Robbed \nTowards the end of the episode, Kim went into the specifics of what happened to her with her sisters, Kourtney and Khloé Kardashian . She started off with:\n\"I'm calling to them, like, ‘Hello! Hello! Hello!' and there's no answer. My heart started to get really tense. Like, you know your stomach just kind of like knots up and you're like okay, what's going on? I knew something wasn't quite right.\"\nHow terrifying. Kardashian West continued amid an interview:\n\"He grabbed my legs — I had no clothes on under there — and he pulled me towards him at the front of the bed and I thought, ‘Okay, this is the moment he's going to rape me.' I fully mentally prepped myself and he didn't. He duct taped my legs together and then they had the gun up to me, I knew that was the moment they were totally going to shoot me in the head.\nI just prayed that Kourtney's going to have a normal life after she sees my dead body on the bed. I have a family. I have my kids and husband, my mom, I'm not going to make it out of here. I know how these things go.\"\nWhile discussing the crime with her sisters, Kim concluded:\n\"They then picked me up and put me in the bathroom and then ran. It's all replaceable. None of it matters.\"\nTalk about a traumatizing experience. We're so glad that Kim wasn't physically hurt, but we hope (with time) her emotional wounds heal.\nAs always, we're thinking about the Kardashian-West-Jenner clan as they reflect on this particularly troubling moment .\n[ Image via E! . ] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:53:25.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
