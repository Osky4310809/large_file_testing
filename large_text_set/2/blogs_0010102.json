But in the end, the crime lab found no drugs. \nLaw enforcement consultant Chuck Drago said that a field test can be wrong, which is why officers should look for additional evidence to justify an arrest. \n\"Something that would give some indication that this might be a drug,\" he said. \nDrago also said a supervisor should have questioned the arrest report. \nProsecutors eventually dropped the drug charge against Rushing, who has filed a lawsuit against the city of Orlando. \nRiggs-Hopkins later received training on how to conduct the drug tests. \nIn the wake of this case, Orlando police ordered that every officer in the department take a review course on the field drug tests and pass a follow-up exam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:11:37.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
