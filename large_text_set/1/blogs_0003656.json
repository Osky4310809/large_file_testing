Its owner could have used it to cast spells more powerful than any believed to be magically possible. [1] For example, Harry Potter was able to repair his regular Phoenix feather wand using the Elder Wand in 1998 , even though broken wands were held, by experts such as Garrick Ollivander , to be damaged beyond magical repair and despite not having any training in wandlore . Both Ollivander and Voldemort believed that the wand's legendary powers is the only one capable of overpowering the bond between the latter and Harry, which created such an effect that Harry managed to overcome Voldemort's attempt to kill him. [1] However, there appears to be limitations, since Dumbledore was not able to cure petrified victims of Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, nullify the curse on Marvolo Gaunt's ring , and neither was he able to overcome the enchantments upon Voldemort's Drink of Despair with the wand amplifying his own magic, suggesting that the wand can merely improve pre-existing spells rather than allow the user to perform the impossible. \nAlthough the wand was rumoured to be unbeatable, in Dumbledore's commentary on The Tale of The Three Brothers , in The Tales of Beedle the Bard , he commented that the Elder Wand, while being immensely powerful, had never been unbeatable, as it had been beaten hundreds of times. [2] For it to pass to a new master, the wand must have been beaten, and as there had been many masters of the wand, it was obvious that it was possible to defeat the wielder of the Elder Wand. However, since the first story of the Elder Wand passing featured the Wand's master being killed while he was asleep rather than being defeated in a duel, duels may not be required to claim the wand. Voldemort casting the Shield penetration spell with the Elder Wand, to breach Hogwarts protection \nWhile it is stated that a wand will not give up its master so easily if it is attempted to be won, The Elder Wand seems to do this time and time again. However this might not be referring to its willingness to give up its master, but rather to the amount of effort it took to defeat the wielder of the Wand. As the wand, like the eldest brother in the Tale, embodied the conceit that \"Might is Right\", greater power would, from its perspective, indicate superiority. Ron has noted that he would choose the wand of the three Hallows, but argued that he would do so while not proclaiming his ownership of it, reasoning that the wand was only dangerous to the first brother because he bragged about owning it rather than the wand being dangerous on its own. \nIt appears that the Elder Wand is still somewhat more powerful than other wands, even when the user has not mastered it, as seen when it was in the hands of Lord Voldemort. However, Voldemort was a very powerful wizard even without special artefacts to aid him. It is unknown to what extent his power was boosted by the wand, but it is certain that he never unlocked its full power, because he was never the Wand's true master. Voldemort himself sensed, and was immensely frustrated by, this fact. \nIt did have one redeeming quality, however: it refused to harm or kill its master nor those under sacrificial protection. Symbolism Edit \nIn the Deathly Hallows symbol, the Elder Wand is shown as the vertical line that goes right through the middle of the circle and the triangle ; it represents the aspects of power and invincibility of the Hallows as a whole, the tent pole, as it were, of the entire edifice. Other elder wands Edit \nWhile \"The Elder Wand\" (capitalised) refers to one of the Deathly Hallows , other wands have been made from elder wood. [2] In general wizards seem to eschew elder wands, due at least in part to the sordid history of the Elder Wand itself, favouring wands made from various other woods, such as holly, willow, vine, and oak. [2] Ron repeats an old wizarding saying, \" Wand of elder, never prosper \" after Hermione reads The Tale of the Three Brothers , to illustrate how wizarding lore may be passed from generation to generation. [1] Behind the scenes Elder Wand in LEGO form The real elder wand movie prop The Elder Wand cracking The filmmakers first designed Albus Dumbledore's wand for its first appearance in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005 , years before it was revealed to be the Elder Wand, or indeed what the Elder Wand even was, when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was published in 2007 . Fortunately, the wand they created happened to be unique and immediately recognisable among all the wands in the film series: the prop was made of English oak , with a small bone inlay inscribed with runes, and outcroppings of nodules running down its length [13] — which even resemble clusters of elderberries. A fan theory by SuperCarlinBrothers indicates a possible different reason for the Elder Wands loyalty. The theory proclaims that Grindelwald was never master of the Elder Wand because he failed to kill Gregorovich during stealing it. This would explain why he failed to defeat Dumbledore with it as it was \" a wand that must always win duels for its owner\" . The theory goes on to hypothesis that Dumbledore was never its master either but, after killing Gregorovich, Voldemort was. This means Draco was never its master either which, by extension, means Harry also was not. Yet, the Elder Wand resisted Voldemort due to it being \" a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered death \", which, as Dumbledore pointed out, Voldemort was not due to his outlandish efforts to avoid dying at all costs. Dumbledore had stated that the true Master of Death understands that death is unavoidable and embraces mortality. When Harry let the Elder Wand \"kill\" him, and returned from the dead, the Elder Wand recognised Harry as a wizard who had truly conquered death and became loyal to him. This theory is supported by Grindelwald himself who, upon meeting Voldemort in Numeraguard, stated; \" I never had it \". Although, he could have been lying. Dumbledore's commentary on the Tale of the Three Brothers notes that all known Masters of the Elder Wand had been men. [2] The wand has been available to purchase on the Noble Collection website, contained in an Ollivanders Wand Shop box. This implies, incorrectly, that the wand was made and sold at the shop by Garrick Ollivander . (Though this could be due to the fact that the Noble wand was released before Dumbledore's wand was revealed to be the Elder Wand) Those to whom the Elder Wand isn't loyal can perform feats of magic equivalent to owning a regular wand. In the Battle of Hogwarts , Voldemort remarked about this to Severus Snape , and reasoned that, since he believed Snape to be the master of the Elder Wand, Voldemort would have to kill him to claim true mastery of it. The only thing that it has been shown that the Elder Wand can't do (or, rather, won't do) is harm its own master if it finds itself in the physical possession of another. Unfortunately for Voldemort, Draco Malfoy was the master of the wand, as he was the one who disarmed Dumbledore. [1] At the end of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , the Elder Wand is seen lying on the headmaster's desk, instead of being buried in the White Tomb . This scene must take place before Dumbledore's burial (which isn't seen on film), given that in the next film adaptation, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 , the wand is buried with its former master. In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Albus Dumbledore claimed he would make it easy for Draco Malfoy and allowed Malfoy to disarm him, though he could have defended himself. Therefore it seems as though he wanted Malfoy to have the Wand; however it should be noted that the Elder Wand was said to only switch allegiance if it was removed from its master against his will. However it's possible that Dumbledore truly hadn't expected Draco to attack him, even if only to disarm him, and was therefore genuinely caught off guard. Also, because he was in a very weak and slow state from drinking the Potion , it's likely that he was just too slow and weak to defend himself. If Dumbledore had managed to keep his wand and not be disarmed by Draco Malfoy, then he would have presumably been disarmed by one of the Death Eaters before Snape came, if they saw him. However they didn't attack him directly, as they knew that Draco needed to kill him, so it's possible that Dumbledore could have kept his wand. It's unknown how Severus Snape would have reacted if he had seen Dumbledore with the wand, but most likely, given the ravaging effects of the curse which Dumbledore was already suffering, he would have killed him anyway. It's unknown what would have happened to the Elder Wand if Dumbledore had been killed by the Inferi in the Horcrux Cave. It might be that its loyalty would have passed to their master, as Voldemort seemed to believe would be the case when he instructed Nagini to kill Snape. Albus Dumbledore and Egbert the Egregious are the only known wizards to have defeated a Master of the Elder Wand (Gellert Grindelwald and Emeric the Evil , respectively) in a wizarding duel. [7] Other Masters of the Elder Wand obtained mastery through deceit, stealth (as when Grindelwald stole it from Gregorovitch), [1] foul play (the murder of Antioch Peverell in his sleep), [3] happenstance (as when Draco Malfoy disarmed Albus Dumbledore, who was concurrently casting a Full Body-Bind Curse on Harry Potter) [8] or beating the current master while he doesn't physically possess the wand (as in Harry Potter's disarming of Draco Malfoy). [1] This is another testament to Dumbledore's innate magical skills, which he references to Harry when the latter is in limbo by admitting that although both he and Grindelwald were evenly matched in magic, he was a shade more skilful. The Elder Wand, therefore, bears a certain resemblance to the One Ring in J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\", as an instigator of murder and mayhem. In the film adaptation for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Parts 1 and 2, it seems that the Elder Wand has a much darker colour; this may be a change the film makers employed to make the wand fit better with Voldemort's \"dark and evil\" personality. The curse that killed Lord Voldemort came from the Elder Wand. As Voldemort thought that Snape was the Master, Voldemort killed him. Draco, however, was the true Master, as he had disarmed Dumbledore, and then Harry disarmed Draco. So, when Voldemort tried to kill Harry, the Wand wouldn't harm its master, and so turned the spell back on Voldemort. Although this does make one wonder why it didn't backfire on Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest , as Harry was already the Master of the Elder Wand by then. Perhaps it was because Nagini, a Horcrux, was still alive, or it may have been because Harry intended to die, much as Dumbledore did when facing Snape in the Astronomy Tower. Alternatively, it may have been that, since Harry didn't fight back, he couldn't be defeated. Alternatively, it's possible that the curse did indeed backfire because it destroyed the piece of Voldemort's soul that was in Harry's forehead. Though Harry hoped to break the power of the wand by dying a natural death, he would need to do so without ever being defeated, even by simply being disarmed. Unless the aggressor knew that Harry was the Elder Wand's master, and was attempting to defeat him in order to become master of the wand (in which case, Harry would simply need to allow himself to be defeated intentionally to retain mastery) then it's unlikely the victor would ever know to take control of the Wand, so its mastery would become increasingly difficult to trace if they were defeated in turn, and the probability of their dying a natural death while undefeated would become more and more likely. Further, so long as Harry succeeded in subsequently defeating anyone who defeated him, the allegiance of the wand would return to Harry. This was emphasised when Delphini disarmed Harry without figuring out she attained mastery of the wand. The Noble Collection wand is also not painted correctly. On the movie prop, The shaft is goldish bronze and the knobs are black, but the Noble wand is all black. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 , when Voldemort tries to unleash the Elder Wand's capabilities upon the shield surrounding Hogwarts, he seems to feel a slight pain in his arm carrying the wand, similar to the effects of the Horcrux being destroyed. The wand as well cracks under the strain. In Part 2 of the film adaptation, Harry simply breaks the Elder Wand in half and throws it away as opposed to the seventh book where he repairs his original one. This is justified as the Elder wand is too powerful to fall into the wrong hands. When asked which of the Deathly Hallows they preferred, Hermione Granger chose the Cloak of Invisibility, while Ron chose the Elder Wand, and Harry chose the Resurrection Stone . [14] It's mentioned in Dumbledore's (not entirely honest) commentary that rumours of an unbeatable wand are preposterous. For example, Grindelwald had mastered the \"unbeatable\" Deathstick, and yet was still defeated by Dumbledore in 1945 . [7] However, it's more probable that only one who has mastered the wand by becoming a Master of Death (which is required to truly unlock the Wand's full power) will be unbeatable with it. This is supported by the fact that, although (fifty-one years later) Dumbledore didn't defeat Lord Voldemort in their duel at the Ministry of Magic due to the latter's use of Horcruxes , but ended up fighting him to a stalemate, this is only because he fled. Indeed, it appears that Dumbledore would have won had the fight continued (hence Voldemort fleeing). [15] The Elder Wand is now also available to buy at the 'Making of Harry Potter Studio Tour' in London, where it's known as Professor Dumbledore's Wand. It has never been clearly defined what it means when it is said that the Elder Wand's power will break if its current master dies a natural death. It could mean that its powers would be diminished to the point of it becoming a regular wand, or it could mean its powers being utterly obliterated , as it is known to happen to some wands. In an alternate reality in which Neville Longbottom never killed Nagini , Voldemort managed to kill Harry, suggesting that the Dark Lord had used his immortality to help him overcome the rebounding curse and mastered the wand. There is a distinct possibility that Porpentina Goldstein may have temporarily become Master of the Elder Wand, as in the film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , she disarms Gellert Grindelwald. As it is currently uncertain whether or not Grindelwald already had the Elder Wand by that point in time, it is therefore currently unknown if this is indeed the case. If she did in fact become the Elder Wand's Master, then at some point following the events of the film and before his final duel with Albus Dumbledore, Grindelwald would have had to have disarmed her, in order to once again become the Wand's Master. It is also possible, should the Elder Wand already been in Grindelwald's possession, that Newt Scamander , not Porpentina Goldstein , became the Elder Wand's Master, as it is defeat, not specifically disarmament, that transfers mastery of the Elder Wand. Though Tina disarmed Grindelwald, Newt had technically already 'defeated' Grindelwald beforehand. In this case, the Hermione becomes the Master of the Elder Wand after the duel in Godric's Hollow in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , as she binds Delphini , the last master very similarly to how Newt Scamander binds Graves / Grindelwald . A fan theory for the Elder Wand's origins theorizes that the Elder Wand is a piece of death itself, which can summon him from anywhere. This theory has yet to be proven and based on J.K. Rowling's explanations of the Elder Wand, is probably untrue. Author's comments Edit \nJ. K. Rowling has discussed how the Elder Wand behaves slightly different from other wands in its loyalty: \" The Elder Wand is simply the most ruthless of wands in that it will only take into consideration strength. One would expect a certain amount of loyalty from one's wand. So even if you were disarmed while carrying it, even if you lost a fight while carrying it, it has developed an affinity with you that it won't give up easily. If, however, a wand is won, properly won in an adult duel, then a wand may switch allegiance ... However, the Elder Wand knows no loyalty except to strength. It's completely unsentimental. It will only go where the power is. So if you win, then you've won the wand. You don't need to kill with it. But ... almost inevitably, it attracts wizards who are prepared to kill and who will kill. And also it attracts wizards like Voldemort who confuse being prepared to murder with strength. \" [16] See also", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T03:02:32.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
