By: FE Online | Published: March 26, 2017 2:42 PM Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath (ANI) \nHe may have assumed office as the new chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, but that has not stopped Yogi Adityanath from being as outspoken as he was earlier, taking things head on and freely expressing his views on religion and what was wrong with the way certain people choose to interpret it or act upon. The MP of Gorakhpur, Adityanath was popular for his inflammatory remarks on the basis of caste and religion many times in the past. But after becoming the CM, he has shown his other side – a dedicated and hardworking leader along with humbleness. On Saturday, also, while arriving at his parliamentary constituency of Gorakhpur for the first time since taking over the new position as CM, Yogi thanked the people and repeated his vow for growth and development of the state and saying he will ensure no discrimination on the basis of caste, religion or gender. However, things turned almost immediately as the CM could not stop himself in a public address on Sunday. He said, “Tulsidas ji ne kabhi Akbar ko raja nahi maana tha, unka kehna tha ki mera raja ek hi hai-Bhagwan Ram” (saint Tulsidas never took Akbar as his king. He always stood on saying that his king is only one – Lord Ram). \nMeanwhile, the work of CM has become visible. He has ordered shutting down of illegal slaughterhouses across the state, setting up of anti-romeo squads and making orders for the cops to attend to the complainants politely without harming their dignity. The CM also made surprise checks at various offices of state’s capital, Lucknow including Hazratganj police station, crime branch and cyber cell. \nYou may also like to watch: \nIn recent assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) won a huge majority in Uttar Pradesh, winning as many as 325 seats out of 403 seats (on its own BJP got 312). With the declaration of the result on March 11, the question arose as to who will be the CM of the state. There were lots of names in the race including union ministers Rajnath Singh , Manoj Singh and other party leaders. Keeping full stop on the discussion, the party on March 18, finalised the name of Yogi Adityanath, who took oath on the next day of this.
