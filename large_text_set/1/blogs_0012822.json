These 12 routes from around the world are so visually striking you’ll be glued to your railroad car’s window for the entire trip. \nThis graphic from Pettitt’s travel agency offers a glimpse of what you’ll see on each of the 12 rail journeys. There’s Scotland’s Jacobite steam train used as the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films.
