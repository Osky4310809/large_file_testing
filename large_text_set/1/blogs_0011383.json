So it's perhaps inevitable he would be micromanaging the details of his inauguration in Washington, D.C. next week.\nHaving the names of the port-a-potties covered up, though? That might seem like going a bit far, until you hear the name of the offending portable toilet company: Don's Johns.\nEven Trump could see how bad that looks — and how quickly the jokes could turn into potty humor.\nSEE ALSO: Twitter will livestream Trump's inauguration with six hours of coverage\nThe Associated Press reported that workers have put blue tape over the company name on dozens of the stalls that have gone up near the Capitol ahead of next Friday's inauguration. Although \"Don's Johns\" is still pretty visible up close, the AP noted for any wide shots and camera pans the letters will be hard to make out.\nTrump, ever the TV personality and media guy, has possibly figured this stinky association out and is stopping any possible viral moment in its tracks. But ironically the cover-up itself is trending, with \"Don's Johns\" one of Twitter's trending topics Friday.\nThe AP, however, couldn't confirm who had ordered the name cover-up.\nImage: AP Photo/Matthew Daly\nRobert Weghorst, chief operating officer for Don's Johns, said he didn't know about the port-a-potty incident. \"We don't know why it's being done. We didn't tell someone to do it,\" he told the AP. \"We're proud to have our name on the units.\"\nSocial media lit up once it looked like Trump was covering up something on the toilets.\nWhen Don's Johns is trending, it must be worth a pee.\nPeek. I mean peek.

During those events no one taped over the toilets with the company logo on full display. But to be fair the toilet's didn't say \"Barry's Johns.\" There's just not as good a ring to it.\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting.\nBONUS: In stunning exchange, Trump refuses to answer question from CNN reporter", "external_links": ["https://t.co/3LrEBBfRrT", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/PvbbHJHF.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/O-yW6Ol27ALWmEA5-PU2rHIxa8g=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F348426%2F8848fb86-dd7f-408a-9836-efedc86b0b11.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/k9aakHBpLqpPD_TJO8InDdbjBEU=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F348426%2F8848fb86-dd7f-408a-9836-efedc86b0b11.jpg", "https://twitter.com/DirkLangeveld/status/820025167963422721", "http://theweek.com/speedreads/663514/donald-trump-reportedly-yelled-media-bigwigs-publishing-picture-double-chin", "https://twitter.com/PhilGibbon/status/820029263554510848", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/PvbbHJHF.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoldenShowers?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/skilledscribe/status/820033793398632448", "https://twitter.com/DonDorabrennan/status/820027309042319361"], "published": "2017-01-14T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:36:02.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
