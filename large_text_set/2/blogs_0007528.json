And this, needless to say, is a very bad thing:\nIt was at a campaign rally in August that President Trump most fully unveiled the dark vision of an America under siege by “radical Islam” that is now radically reshaping the policies of the United States.\nOn a stage lined with American flags in Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Trump, who months before had called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslim immigration, argued that the United States faced a threat on par with the greatest evils of the 20th century. The Islamic State was brutalizing the Middle East, and Muslim immigrants in the West were killing innocents at nightclubs, offices and churches, he said. Extreme measures were needed.\n“The hateful ideology of radical Islam,” he told supporters, must not be “allowed to reside or spread within our own communities.”\nMr. Trump was echoing a strain of anti-Islamic theorizing familiar to anyone who has been immersed in security and counterterrorism debates over the last 20 years. He has embraced a deeply suspicious view of Islam that several of his aides have promoted, notably retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, now his national security adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist.\nPlease read the story at the link and parse it carefully, for this is how the mouthpieces of the Left masquerading as news organizations will henceforth attempt to take down the Trump administration, strangling the baby in its cradle if it can, but promising four years of biased, negative coverage. It's all part of the \"Resistance,\" the movement to delegitimize the new president even before he has fully taken the reins of office.\nThis worldview borrows from the “clash of civilizations” thesis of the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, and combines straightforward warnings about extremist violence with broad-brush critiques of Islam. It sometimes conflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and, at times, with the 1.7 billion Muslims around the world. In its more extreme forms, this view promotes conspiracies about government infiltration and the danger that Shariah , the legal code of Islam, may take over in the United States.\nThose espousing such views present Islam as an inherently hostile ideology whose adherents are enemies of Christianity and Judaism and seek to conquer nonbelievers either by violence or through a sort of stealthy brainwashing.\nIslam's inherent hostility toward the West seems to me utterly inarguable. From the time the Arab armies swept out of the desert, the adherents of the Religion of Peace have waged continual war upon Christendom, the formerly Christian middle east, Hindu India, Zoroastrian Persia, and Indonesia. To deny that is simply irresponsible.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/06/the-left-and-islam-brothers-from-another-mother/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/sharia_islamic_law/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"], "published": "2017-02-06T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:06:07.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
