Steve Rosenbloom reportedly just traded McDermott to the Thunder in a package that included Taj Gibson and a draft pick, which makes you wonder about the return that Bulls general manager Gar Forman got.\nOne player, Cameron Payne, is a point guard averaging two assists a game and is shooting 33.1 percent this season, which makes him a perfect Bulls guard. \nPayne, I guess, is the latest to get chance to be the Bulls’ point guard of the future, if the Bulls have a future. \nAnother player, Anthony Morrow , is a shooting guard who hits less than 30 percent of his three-point tries this season, so, yeah, again, perfect for the Bulls. \nAnother player, Joffrey Lauvergne , is a 6-foot-11 center who might grow up to be Robin Lopez. The Bulls already have one of those.

(Getty, AP photos) \nBut hey, Lauvergne is French, so at least the Bulls have someone who can prepare Duck L’Orange. \nThose players, remember, are coming from a Thunder team that lost Kevin Durant and would seemingly need help from and provide opportunities for a lot more players. \nThe Bulls lose a terrific pro in Gibson, who was entering free agency. So the Bulls got something for him, which likely turns out to be more playing time for Bobby Portis , who is coming off a 19-point, eight-rebound game. He wasn’t as good the game before that, but he was in double figures the game before that. Before that, not since January. \n  \nSo, you don’t know what you’re going to get with Portis, and if the arc of player improvement on this team is any indication, that inconsistency will continue maddeningly. \nMcDermott was supposed to be the shooter Forman envisioned as the player who spaced the floor for Fred Hoiberg’s offense. Instead, he seemed to become the player against whom opponents made contract bonuses. \nMcDermott originally cost the Bulls two first-round picks, and now you can add a second-rounder in the Thunder deal. So, both McDermott and Forman come out of this looking devalued, if Forman’s player and coaching assessments had room to be devalued. \nAnd here’s the thing: McDermott is a better three-point shooter than the guards the Bulls acquired. \nWe know that McDermott doesn’t have a job with the Bulls anymore. We don’t know why Forman still does. \nJimmy Butler , the biggest trade piece to retool a team struggling hold a playoff spot, wasn’t traded for a lottery pick, a trade that would’ve sent the Bulls tumbling into the lottery, too, thus giving them a couple shots to get younger, more athletic and closer to a title quickly. \nBecause Indiana passed on trade offers for Paul George , and because George appears headed to the Lakers first chance he gets, the Butler-to-Boston rumors can resume as soon as the lottery determines where the Nets’ first-round pick gets slotted. \nBut no. The Vertical’s Adrian Wojnarowski said the Bulls wanted core players from the Celtics at the deadline, not young players and future assets. Huh? \nBut wait. There’s more. Wojnarowski said the Celtics put both of the Nets’ first round picks — this year’s and 2018’s — on the table. \nIf true, I don’t know how everybody still has a job. \nWhat happened Thursday, then, makes you wonder whether the Bulls are trying to trade their way into the lottery without trading Butler. \nBut that would presume there’s any kind of credible plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:18:15.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
