I wouldn't count him out.\" \nMulvaney delivered a similar message to House Republicans Thursday night, warning that Trump would turn to other priorities such as a tax overhaul if the health plan pushed by House Speaker Paul Ryan is rejected by rebels in his own party. \nMulvaney also rejected a new Congressional Budget Office analysis that warns the latest health plan version would reduce cost savings by $200 billion. \"The CBO score is just wrong on that,\" Mulvaney said. \n___ \n7:55 a.m. \nA lack of women in a photo of negotiations over the GOP health care bill that was tweeted out by Vice President Mike Pence is drawing criticism from Democrats. \nThe photo shows Pence at the center of a conference table during negotiations with the House Freedom Caucus. About two dozen men can be seen in the photo and not a single woman. \nWashington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray drew attention to the absence of women in the room by retweeting the photo and sarcastically adding, \"A rare look inside the GOP's women's health caucus.\" \nA repeal of a maternity care requirement is among the concessions the Freedom Caucus is demanding in exchange for support of the bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T15:08:36.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
