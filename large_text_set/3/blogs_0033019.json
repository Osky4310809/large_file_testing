It's not like there's any REAL body policing Donald Trump 's behavior.\nWe're pretty sure Devin Nunes proved that .\nVideo: Seth Meyers HIGHlariously Compares Donald To THE DUDE! \nSo now, after already serving as an informal adviser to POTUS from her office in the West Wing, Ivanka Trump is making things official, taking the title of \"assistant to the President.\"\nIn a press release announcing the move, which marks a 180 degree flop from her claim in the Trump family's group 60 Minutes interview that she would remain \"a daughter,\" Ivanka explained: \n\"I have heard the concerns some have with my advising the president in my personal capacity while voluntarily complying with all ethics rules and I will instead serve as an unpaid employee in the White House Office, subject to all of the same rules as other federal employees.\"\nShe says she'll be unpaid, but then again Drumpf said he wasn't going to take a salary as President either, so we know what that word is worth. Ivanka continued:\n\"Throughout this process, I have been working closely and in good faith with the White House Counsel and my personal counsel to address the unprecedented nature of my role.\"\nUm, is it just us or should someone OUTSIDE the White House determine whether everyone in the White House is being ethical??\nVideo: Hillary Clinton Accuses The White House Of 'Everyday Sexism' \nUp until now Ivanka, whose husband Jared Kushner is already senior adviser, has already been very involved in White House business. She sat next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau during their visits (she even shook hands properly with them).\nBut because Ivanka wasn't a government employee, she had legal leeway to avoid certain rules. This move is ostensibly to quell ethical concerns over her access.\nBut the White House's statement on the matter gives a clearer picture of what the new role will actually entail:\n\"Ivanka's service as an unpaid employee furthers our commitment to ethics, transparency, and compliance and affords her increased opportunities to lead initiatives driving real policy benefits for the American public that would not have been available to her previously.\"\nHmm. More Trumps with more power. Yay.\nAt least they couldn't get much worse, right?\n[ Image via Twitter . ] \nTags: donald trump , ivanka trump , jared kushner , legal matters , politik", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:51:42.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
