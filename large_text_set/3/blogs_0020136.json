After all, we’ve been waiting 10 goddamn years. I figured it was a very appropriate question to ask. \nBut never mind me, all you need to know is Dave Chappelle’s new comedy special is finally here. For weeks, Netflix teased us with hilarious trailers that only subdued our craving for genuine laughter. \nHere’s the first trailer. \nThe trailers gave us a glimpse into the hilarity that would ensue on March 21. Thankfully, March 21 is here and we were blessed with not one, but TWO new specials from Mr. Chappelle. \nBoy, does he have a lot to say! \nHere’s the second (official) trailer. \nNow, I’ve already seen both of the specials, but don’t worry, I personally don’t believe in spoilers so I won’t even go there. All you need to know is the 43-year-old comedy legend is back (and hopefully here to stay). \nChappelle showcases his effortlessly flawless stand-up technique by intertwining foul language and blatant, unapologetic realness while discussing all that’s been on his mind during his hiatus. Giphy \nIn a combined 132 minutes, the funnyman responsible for introducing the world to Ashy Larry and “The Niggar Family” on Comedy Central’s “Chappelle’s Show” reminds us of exactly what the world’s been missing. \nIf you still need convincing of why you should set a couple of hours aside tonight, just leave it to the Twitter community! People just can’t get enough of Dave Chappelle’s new stand-up comedy special on Netflix. New Dave Chappelle specials are fucking amazing. Dave still gots it. Best comedian ever, dont argue with me on this \n— Dan Rykala (@Saltyrykala) March 21, 2017 It looks like he’s proved his legend status yet again. Dave Chappelle is a fucking legend \n— Nate (@mannion_nate) March 21, 2017 Was Chappelle really gone for 10 years?! It’s hard to tell. The Dave Chappelle comedy special on netflix is absolutely hilarious!! 10years off and its like he never missed a beat @DaveChappelle \n— Bill Owens (@chibill3) March 21, 2017 I think we can all agree we NEEDED these laughs. Dave Chappelle funny AF \n— RaShad Lewis (@UKnow_shad) March 21, 2017 Dave delivered them effortlessly. \n— Advaith Warrier (@AdvaithW) March 21, 2017 It didn’t take long before people were laughing their asses off. Finally watching the new Dave Chappelle, 2 minutes in and it's already the greatest stand up in human history, I'm calling it now \n— Sushi Boi Charlie (@Pink_Marse) March 21, 2017 Be careful watching them at work, though! idk why i'm trying to watch Dave Chappelle at work. Impossible to hold my laughter in. \n— Key Lowlita (@KeyloLowkey) March 21, 2017 It’s THAT damn funny. Of course, the new material sparked a massive debate over which comedian really reigns supreme these days… Dave Chappelle > All comedians. Don't @ me. You'll just be wasting your time. \n— Vandal Savage (@intrikitt) March 21, 2017 The truth is there’s no comparison. Dave Chappelle is in a league of his own, and he makes that clear in his latest offering. Dave Chappelle is the \n— Kyle Thompson (@kyle_thompson26) March 21, 2017 He covers everything from the times he met OJ Simpson… @DaveChappelle 's new comedy special on Netflix is straight !! Only he could still make OJ jokes great again! \n— David Jay (@DavidJStarr) March 21, 2017 …to how fed up he is with Key and Peele. \"I been on strike for ten years! Y'all niggas ain't stop working. I had to watch key and peele do my show every night!\" \n– Dave Chappelle \n— 1st Year Millionaire (@ChampagneMalc) March 21, 2017 \nAnd that doesn’t even cover a fraction of everything else he’s been holding in for a decade. \nIf you haven’t already, I highly suggest you fire up that Netflix app, set your phone to “do not disturb” and witness comical greatness… You won’t regret it!
