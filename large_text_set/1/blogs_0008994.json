YouTube \nIn his much-anticipated first press conference at which he announced nothing new, Donald Trump was in full preening, gloating, hypocritial, bullying splendor. Ostensibly, the press conference was called to announce how Trump will disentangle himself from his numerous conflicts of interest, but nothing new was revealed. His sons are going to run the company, and that is supposed to take care of it. Trump took the opportunity to attack the \"dishonest media,\" and especially the \"failing\" Buzzfeed site for releasing salacious and damning documents about his activities in Russia.

Here were some of the most scathing reactions on Trump's favorite medium: 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T20:44:33.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
