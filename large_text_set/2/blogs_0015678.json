Our PM is anti-Dalit man,\" she said. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 20, 2017 3:42 PM “Narendra means negative, Damodardas means Dalit, Modi means man. Our PM is anti-Dalit man,” she said. \nBSP supremo Mayawati on Monday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi by dubbing him ‘anti-Dalit man’. Addressing a rally during the fourth phase campaign of Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017, she spelled out meaning of PM Modi’s name. “Narendra means negative, Damodardas means Dalit, Modi means man. Our PM is anti-Dalit man,” she said. Mincing no words, she said, “PM Modi doesn’t know BSP is a movement first and then a party.” In an apparent bid to reach out to the minority voters, she said, “I didn’t get married, instead spent my life for welfare of minorities especially Muslims.” This comes after PM Modi today mocked at Mayawati’s opposition to note ban, saying BSP is no longer Bahujan Samaj Party but ‘Behenji Sampati Party’. \nAt an election rally in Orai region of Jalaun in Bundelkhand region, the Prime Minister said those who deposit wealth for themselves can never solve the problems of people. He also attacked the SP and Congress for criticising the demonestisation decision. \nWatch this video #WATCH : BSP President Mayawati says PM Modi’s full name means that he is an anti-Dalit man. pic.twitter.com/Nhl0lDbNH3 \n— ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) February 20, 2017 \n“Where has Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) reached today…when I announced note ban on November 8 last year, arch-rivals SP and BSP, who never see eye-to-eye, came together…I was amazed when I launched war against corruption and asked for the details of blackmoney. They came together and all including the Congress started speaking the same language,” Modi said. \nThe main concern of the parties in Uttar Pradesh was not note ban but that they did not get enough time to stash away the ill-gotten money. \nWatch this video \n“Behenji (Mayawati) alleges that government was ill-prepared… was it the government or it was you who was not prepared…she said one week should have been given (before implementing note ban)…Mulayam also said the same,” he said. \n“Money started being deposited in banks all of a sudden (after note ban) and (Mayawati) started shouting as why is it only at election time that the account of her brother has been made public…why is it being discussed that Rs 100 crore have been deposited,” he said. \n“Arrey Behenji discussion not because elections are being held but because you have deposited Rs 100 crore after note ban…BSP is no longer Bahujan Samaj Party…bahujan toh Mayawati me simat gaya hai…it is Behenji Sampatti Party now. Those who deposit wealth for themselves, can they solve your problem?” he asked. \nModi said BJP ’s fight is against scam meaning ‘ghotale’. \n“I have said SCAM stood for SP, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati…there is a leader who is seeing honesty and service in scam and had said for us scam is ‘seva’ do you need such service? You have an opportunity in this elections to throw out SCAM from Bundelkhand,” he said, without naming Rahul Gandhi . \nHigh-decibel campaign has begun for the fourth phase of Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017. 53 assembly seats will go polls on February 23. BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken on Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance by unleashing a number of jibes at Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi. BSP led by Maywati is trying to reach out to voters. \nOver 61.16 per cent of the electorate yesterday exercised their franchise in the third phase of polling to decide the fate of 826 candidates in Uttar Pradesh’s 69 Assembly constituencies considered crucial for the ruling Samajwadi Party. The turnout, which is higher by more than 1 per cent as compared to last Assembly polls, is expected to go up and touch 63 per cent as many voters were still in queues outside polling booths when the percentage was collated at 5 pm, officials said.About 2.41 crore people, including 1.10 crore women and 1,026 people belonging to the ‘third gender’ category, were eligible to vote in this phase. He said the polling was by and large peaceful in this phase for which tight security arrangements were put in place at all the 25,603 polling booths.
