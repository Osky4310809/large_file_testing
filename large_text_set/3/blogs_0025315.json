incident as an 'epic lunchbox fail' Friday 24 March 2017 18:58 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online The drink had an alcohol volume of 4.7 per cent AFP/Getty Images \nAn Australian woman accidentally sent her 5-year-old daughter to school with a vodka-based alcopop in her schoolbag. \nDescribing the incident as an “epic lunchbox fail”, the unnamed woman from Queensland said she had told her daughter to help herself to frozen packets of juice in a freezer drawer. \nThe school reportedly phoned the woman to ask what had happened. Read more \nWriting on Facebook, the woman said: “EPIC lunchbox fail when you tell your five-year-old Preppie to put a frozen juice pouch in her lunchbox and you forget the other pouches in your freezer.” \nAt the end of the post she added several emoticons of a smiling face crying with laughter. \nShe later added: “Made for a veeeery interesting phone call from the teacher!” \nThe drink the woman’s daughter had taken was a Smirnoff raspberry sorbet flavoured “freeze and squeeze” vodka mixed drink. \nThe 250ml concoction is sold in a plastic pouch and has an alcohol volume of 4.7 per cent. \nThe woman confirmed her daughter had not been sent to school with the drink and had mistakenly taken it. \nThe child’s mother wrote: “They were very good about it lol. I made light of it (it was obviously innocent on my daughter’s behalf).
