It’s just not right.” \nThe teen’s family reported her missing Sunday afternoon . She left to go to the store and didn’t come back. The teen’s uncle called Stacey Elkins, her mother, and told her he had seen a live video of the girl being assaulted by a group of people. \nElkins brought screenshots of the video to Johnson who was “visibly upset” by the live stream. The video, according to Elkins, features her daughter unclothed. \n“For you to do something like that and then to post it up on Facebook like it’s a joke, it’s just terrible. I know they’ll get their day coming,” Elkins said of the video . \nThe girl was found Tuesday morning and seemed to be all right. She was taken to a hospital for an examination. \nFacebook has since removed the video. \nThis is the second time in a few months that a Chicago crime was live streamed over Facebook. A group of black Chicago residents live streamed their brutal assault of a white mentally handicapped man in January.
