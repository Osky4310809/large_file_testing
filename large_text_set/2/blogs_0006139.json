It had a school constructed from nothing more than sticks and wooden boards, and there was only one doctor and one nurse to provide medical care in the makeshift clinic. \n\"I have more medication in my household medicine cabinet than they had there,\" Lu said. \n\"The minute I got there, I heard a boom and thought it was to celebrate the New Year, but everyone around me began to look for shelter in panic-that's when I realized these were explosions, not fireworks.\" \nDespite the food shortages, Lu was able to find some pork, chicken and fish, which she bought for some of the children to enjoy a New Year's Eve dinner at the school, while she sat and ate roast potatoes. \n\"That's the only time I saw pork during my entire stay,\" she said. \nEach day, she gave lectures to the children and made house calls to conduct consultations. \nOne man in his mid-30s she spotted hanging around people's homes looking for food had undiagnosed clinical depression, which began to improve once Lu met with him and taught him some coping mechanisms. \n\"It might seem like I am just consulting with them, but they have also helped me to appreciate life more,\" she said. \n\"I used to complain a lot, but my experiences there have changed me greatly.\" \nLu was particularly moved when the time came to leave. \n\"Everyone came to hug me and a girl, who was always shy, timidly came to shake my hand,\" she said. \nNext Spring Festival, Lu plans to recruit 100 volunteers to help out in the camps, hoping that the extra manpower will allow her to \"do things better\". \n\"I came back with a renewed appreciation for the plight of the Myanmar refugees and love for my Chinese friends,\" she wrote in a social media post after returning to China. \n\"Though I came back in haste and in darkness, I don't feel tired at all.\" \nContact the writers at liangshuang@chinadaily.com.cn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:38:35.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
