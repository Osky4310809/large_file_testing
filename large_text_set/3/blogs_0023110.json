(Photo via Netflix) Stay on target MovieBob Reviews: IRON FIST (Season 1) Who is the Iron Fist: Getting to Know Danny Rand Iron Fist , the final new series in the Marvel Netflix partnership before the big Defenders crossover series, plopped onto the streaming service last Friday. Now that an entire weekend’s gone by, those who care way too much about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (me) has had a chance to binge through the 13-hour season. By now, it shouldn’t surprise you to hear that it’s bad. It’s exhaustingly bad. I write about TV for a living and watching Iron Fist is the most it’s felt like work in a long time.\nIt’s a surprising misstep because Marvel’s Netflix efforts have overall been great. Daredevil has been a fun, faithful take on one of Marvel’s most underrated heroes, Jessica Jones was pretty close to perfect and Luke Cage was beautiful to watch and listen to, even if the story had its problems. Iron Fist has almost nothing going for it, and ends up being a weird outlier. Did it have to be this way? Is there anything they could have done to make this show work? We may never know for sure, but let’s play armchair showrunner for a bit to to try and find out what, if anything, would have made Iron Fist better.\nWould Casting an Asian Lead Have Helped? This was something many people have demanded ever since they found out Marvel was making an Iron Fist show. The character is a product of the 1970s, when stories about white dudes being better at Asian martial arts than Asian people were common. Marvel created the character as a response to a trend. That being the case, I can totally see the argument that Finn Jones’s casting is just being faithful to the character. But just because something is a product of its time doesn’t mean it can’t or shouldn’t be updated. The white savior story doesn’t work for a growing number of audiences anymore. And such an update isn’t entirely unheard of. Marvel’s superheroes have changed identities, sexes, races, backstories, etc. plenty of times. Everything can be and has been retconned, most of the time for the better. Nothing is sacred in the world of comics, especially not marketing decisions made 40-plus years ago.\nWould this have made Iron Fist a better show? Absolutely not. It would still have terrible pacing, dialog and action (we’ll get to that stuff later). The only thing it would fix is that not every line out of Danny’s mouth would be cringe-inducing. It wouldn’t sound so terrible when he talks about his chi, or when he’s giving Colleen Wing unsolicited advice about her form or her dojo. He’d still be an ass, but there wouldn’t be a colonialist undertone to the whole thing. At the very least, it would feel like Marvel was trying something new with a dated character. That might even be enough for some audience members to overlook the show’s other, more glaring flaws. Maybe.\nJessica Henwick as Colleen Wing. (Photo via Netflix)\nMake Colleen Wing the Main Character Why do we have to follow Danny anyway? Throughout the entire season, it’s never quite clear what his mission is or what reason he has to do anything. Colleen has an arc. She has a goal and obstacles that change her outlook on the world. Her story could potentially make for a pretty great season of TV. Jessica Henwick also does a great job on the series, and for the most part, her fight scenes look much better than Danny’s.\nAs it is, the show is more concerned with Danny’s (almost nonexistent) journey than Colleen’s. She has maybe one decent episode in the first have of the season, and the rest of her story is crammed into the last three. You can see the seeds of a much more interesting story in there. Unfortunately, with so much time spent on the senseless Danny/Meechum storyline, Colleen’s is rushed through in the final hours of the season. Iron Fist season two is not something I’d want to see after this past weekend, but I could definitely get on board with Colleen Wing season one.\nWai Ching Ho as Madame Gao. (Photo via Netflix)\nPick a Villain and Stick With It The first two-thirds of Iron Fist are an unfocused mess. There’s nothing driving Danny and he’s completely unaware of the specific people working against him. You know what would really help? A clear villain. Since we’re not very familiar with Iron Fist at this point (and Danny Rand is super lame), a good villain would give him someone to work against and give the audience some sense of who Danny is. Daredevil had Wilson Fisk. Jessica Jones had Kilgrave. Luke Cage had Cottonmouth. Iron Fist has… a serious of increasingly poorly-developed antagonists.\nSeriously, for the first few episodes, the closest thing the series has to a villain are the Meachum siblings, and they’re just generic rich a-holes. Then for a while, it seems like it’s going to be Harold Meachum, but he never does anything that bad. Then it’s Madame Gao, but she’s dealt with surprisingly quickly, considering how scary she’s been in Daredevil . Then it’s Bakuto, but again, that only lasts for a few episodes. Then, right at the very end, surprise, Harold Meachum was the bad guy all along. The end result is a series about things happening to Danny, rather than Danny doing things.\nTom Pelphrey, Finn Jones, and Jessica Stroup. (Photo via Netflix)\nGive Danny a Purpose The biggest problem with the first half of the series is that Danny doesn’t seem to have much reason for anything he does. He’s just a former rich kid who wants to get back in his company because… that’s where his childhood friends are? It’s almost the same story as Arrow , only when Oliver Queen came back to Starling City, he had a purpose. He had a list of people who were corrupting his city and a clear mission to take them out.\nDanny has none of that. He doesn’t know who he’s after or really why he wants to rejoin his family’s company.If Danny had any sort of concrete goal early on, it could have solved the terrible pacing that plagues the entire series. Having a clear, focused goal tends to do that for stories. At the very least, it would have given the audience some reason to root for him. A good superhero needs to be, you know, a hero. If he did anything heroic before episode six, maybe we’d all feel a tiny bit better about this series.\nFinn Jones as Danny Rand. (Photo via Netflix)\nDo More With the Iron Fist For a show called Iron Fist , we didn’t see a whole lot of the titular superpower. The first time we see it is the end of episode two when Danny busts out of the mental hospital. It is admittedly a cool scene, and it should have come much earlier. This should have been the series’s hook, and you can’t ask an audience to wait two hours before anything superheroic happens.\nThe Iron Fist is a really cool special effect. Some of the show’s better moments are when Danny uses his superpowers. Unfortunately, those moments come and go way too fast, and they happen so rarely. As a result, it’s less of a superhero show and more of a dull conspiracy thriller that doesn’t know where it’s going. Once again, for a superhero show, there isn’t a whole lot of “super” going on. Using the Iron Fist more might at least have added some excitement.\nFinn Jones as Danny Rand (Photo via Netflix)\nLet Us See What’s Going On in Action Scenes This may be Iron Fist ‘s biggest sin. Did nobody involved watch any of Marvel’s other Netflix shows? Coming out two years after the first season of Daredevil , there is no excuse for the fight scenes to look this way. All of Marvel’s shows up until now have had excellent fight scenes. Daredevil especially had those brutal long takes that made you feel every hit. I don’t understand how you could see that and think that these fight scenes are at all in the same league.\nIron Fist didn’t even necessarily have to copy that style. (Though it would have helped.) Just let us see the action. Pull the camera back a bit. Hold it still sometimes. Let a shot last longer than a fraction of a second. Any one of these suggestions would have made the fight scenes watchable. I wonder if Daredevil found it easier to shoot those beautifully brutal action scenes because that hero wears a mask. Once the suit is on, you can’t really tell if it’s a stunt double or not. Since Danny Rand doesn’t have a costume, I wonder if they can’t linger on the fight scenes for too long lest we see that it’s not really Finn Jones throwing all those punches. If that’s the case, maybe they could have cast someone who already knew martial arts. Then you wouldn’t have to cover up the action with dizzying cuts.\nIron Fist is a series based on a character even most comics fans barely remember. The character and his books always kind of sucked, but that doesn’t mean this series had to. Would these suggestions have made Iron Fist a critically acclaimed masterpiece? Probably not. But any one of them would have made the series tangibly better, even if just a little bit. At the very least I wouldn’t be regretting spending the entire weekend on it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:19:01.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
