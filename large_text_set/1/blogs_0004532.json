MSNBC has a strong history of news and robust debate – and I am delighted to get back in the news business,” she continued. \n“While I have loved my 4 month vacation – I did many items on my bucket list – it is time to get back to work. I am thrilled to be joining MS/NBC,” she said. “I love new adventures…who doesn’t, right? New adventures revitalize one. This is an exciting adventure for me. I hope you will join it with me.” \nMany of her fans, however, said they wouldn’t be following her to MSNBC. \n“Love you, but, can’t stomach the network. Really surprised that someone as fine and upstanding as you could be able to either. God bless you and protect your mind, heart and soul,” posted Renee Melville. \nNancy Hallisey Wilson agreed, saying, “Oh, Greta, what a terrible choice. So sorry you chose this one.. Please keep your blog up so I can see you on that, but I can’t watch you be compromised on a Soros-funded propaganda station.” \n“No, NO, NO!!! Greta, you are much too good for them,” posted Melissa Reed. “They outright lied about and smeared a loved one of mine. They have zero integrity with me. Don’t go, gawd, I’m in tears. I can’t believe all the Fox women falling like lemmings off the NBC cliff. Heartbreaking.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
