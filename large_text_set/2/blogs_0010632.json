ADVERTISEMENT \n“I thought, before the series, that this would be a defensive battle,” Cone said after limiting the Hotshots to their lowest output of the season and allowing just one player to score in twin digits. “But this is much graver. We’re bleeding for points and so are they. \n“It’s not bad basketball, it’s just really good defense,” he said. “And I’d like to think that this favors us. But they’re a great team, too.” \nSol Mercado and Japeth Aguilar combined for 11 points in the fourth where the Kings scooted away in the dying minutes as the Kings grabbed the confidence booster they need going into Wednesday’s Game 4 at Smart Araneta Coliseum after posting the most convincing win of the series thus far. \nStar won the first two games by an average of three points and the man responsible for doing that, Paul Lee, got bottled up so hard by the Ginebra defense that he was held to seven points, more than 10 below his average. \n“We’re back in the series now and we still have a chance to win this,” Cone, a Grand Slam winner with two different teams, said. “We just need the confidence.” \nComing into the series, Star was easily one of the best, if not the top, offensive teams in the league. But against the bullish Ginebra defense, the Hotshots scored just four points in the last six minutes to lose big. \nMercado went on to finish with 16 points and six assists, while Aguilar wound up with 15 and 13 rebounds. \nThe Kings also got a lift from the veteran Joe Devance, who took pain killer shots for a left foot injury so he could give Ginebra some inside presence. He finished with six points and six rebounds but is “50-50 for Game 4,” according to Cone. \nIn the other Final Four series, TNT KaTropa tries to pin San Miguel Beer’s back harder against the wall when the Texters shoot for a commanding 3-1 lead at 7 p.m. also at MoA Arena on Tuesday . \nThe winner of the series’ last two games, the Texters have all the momentum they need to keep the resilient defending champions at bay. \nBut if there’s one team that knows how to bounce back, it’s San Miguel, having erased a 0-3 deficit in the championship series against Alaska last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:08:05.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
