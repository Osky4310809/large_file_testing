Clattenburg will leave England at the end of the season to take up a lucrative role in the Middle East Share Mark Clattenburg is the Premier League's most high-profile referee (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) Share Get daily     \nTottenham have fared better under Mark Clattenburg than any other current top-flight club. \nThe Saudi Arabia-bound ref is set to remain in the Premier League for the rest of the season before heading over to take up a new role in the Middle East. \nThis may be welcome news to Spurs, who have a better win ratio in league games refereed by Clattenburg over the last four seasons than any other current Premier League club. \nThe Euro 2016 final ref has taken charge of 11 Spurs league games in that time with the north London club winning almost two thirds of those - seven - as well as losing two and drawing two. \nLeicester have the next best record under Clattenburg with a win ratio of 62%, followed by Stoke with a win ratio of 60%.
