But the Queens star took to Instagram on Sunday and hinted that the inspiration for the outfit was only famed artist Pablo Picasso. \nThe ‚ÄúSHETHER‚Äù target was front row at Haider Ackermann‚Äôs AW18 show on Saturday with a black jacket showcasing her exposed left breast, with the nipple covered by a pasty. Once the outfit started drawing attention (and comparisons to her Brooklyn rival), Minaj posted an image of Picasso‚Äôs La Femme √† l‚Äô√âventail painting to IG, which features a female subject with her left breast exposed. \nThe reaction on social media was swift with many showing side-by-side comparison photos of the outfits showing the similarities. While Kim‚Äôs outfit was an actual dress and brighter in appearance with glitter, Minaj‚Äôs look was starker and paired with leather shorts. \nEven with Minaj noting the inspiration behind the fashion choice, there were still some skeptics (largely among Lil Kim fans).
