And as one does when issues come up with a government official as important as president, Bannon's constituents are sending him mail.\nBut before the letters and postcards get sent to the White House where President Bannon sits at a desk in the Oval Office (at least that's how SNL envisions it), people are snapping shots of their political correspondence.\nThe hashtag #PostcardstoBannon includes tons of stamps, handwritten notes and letters addressed to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave with the words \"Bannon\" and \"President\" clearly labeled.\nMy contribution to the #PostcardsToBannon campaign is on its way.
