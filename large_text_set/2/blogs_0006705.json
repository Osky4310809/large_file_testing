NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson will assist the duo and monitor Dragon as it approaches the station for a month-long stay. \nThe crew took a break from SpaceX preparations today and focused on a wide variety of science work. Kimbrough set up a pair of tiny internal satellites known as SPHERES and tested their ability to perform automated docking maneuvers . The tests will assist in the development of computer vision tracking algorithms possibly helping in the recovery of space debris. \nPesquet and Whitson worked in the afternoon to swap a gas bottle inside the Combustion Integrated Rack . The rack, located in the U.S. Destiny laboratory module, enables safe research into how fuels and other materials burn in space. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:39:37.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
