While it won't sell phones at the store — that's still exclusive to Amazon India — customers will have a first-hand opportunity to try out the products before making a purchase online.\n\nThe retail space measures over 14,000 square feet, and is split into four areas: a service center in the basement, a retail and community zone in the mezzanine and ground floors, office space in the upper floors, and culminating in a rooftop cafe and lounge. The store is located on prime real estate in Bangalore's high street — Brigade Road, and will officially open doors tomorrow, January 7, at 2 p.m. IST. OnePlus has several launch-day offers planned for those interested in visiting.\nThe initiative is one of several OnePlus is undertaking as it seeks to build an overall experience centered around its brand . The company doesn't make a lot of money selling phones, so it is branching out into accessories and merchandise, categories that have higher margins.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T13:32:05.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
