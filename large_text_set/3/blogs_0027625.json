It included a lengthy comment from Rachael Holloway, who’s in charge of diversity for the march. We asked Rachael, who heads our diversity team, to respond to today’s STAT News article. pic.twitter.com/on26rX7imr \n— March for Science (@ScienceMarchDC) March 22, 2017 \nThe “March for Science” started to gain traction in January, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes on Facebook. Major environmentalist and activist groups have backed the march , which is planned for Earth Day in Washington, D.C., but sister marches are planned in other cities as well. \nBut as support for the march grew, so did concerns over its core message. \nUniversity of Maine biologist Jacquelyn Gill recently left the march’s organizing committee over “leaders’ resistance to aggressively addressing inequalities — including race and gender,” STAT reported. \n“We were really in this position where, because the march failed to actively address those structural inequalities within its own organization and then to effectively communicate those values outward, we carried those inequalities forward,” Gill told STAT. “Some of these problems stem from the march leadership failing early on in its messaging.” \nGill was part of the wing of conference organizers advocating for scientists and activists to take on broader issues in science, including including issues of racial diversity in science, women’s equality, and immigration policy,” STAT reported. \nOn the other side, Nashville-based web consultant Shane Morris left the march’s organizing committee over worries that “appeasing diversity demands and not worried enough about its legacy,” he told STAT. \n“I’m definitely not against talking about equality issues,” Morris said, “I just felt it was an inappropriate forum.” \nMorris hoped the march would result in further lobbying efforts to pass legislation to fund science programs. Issues, like gender and diversity, could be handled after that. \nThe march’s official statement on diversity has gone substantial changes since January, expanding to include portions on disabilities and inclusiveness. The march’s social media account has also been criticized for not being sensitive enough on gender issues. \nScience activists started organizing the march in January amid fears the Trump administration would cut funding to science programs. Organizers say partisan politics has “given policymakers permission to reject overwhelming evidence” on scientific issues — cue cries over global warming “deniers.” \nOrganizers say the conference is a protest against President Donald Trump, but some scientists have said the march clearly has an ideological bent. \nMedia outlets have certainly interpreted the science march as a protest against Trump’s policies. \n“ Scientists Mad About Trump’s Policies are Taking Action ,” NBC New reported. “ The Scientist’s March on Washington Now Has a Date ,” Time wrote. \n“If you’re wondering what this has to do with science, you’re certainly not alone,” Alex Berezow, a senior fellow at the American Council on Science and Health, wrote in a post about why he’s not attending the march. \n“The answer, of course, is nothing. These issues are the primary concern of revisionist historians and social justice warriors, not empirically-minded scientists,” Berezow wrote, pointing to public statements by march organizers. \nFollow Michael on Facebook and Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
