She had been strangled to death after days tied to a bed. \n“This murder was torture. That child suffered a slow and agonizing death,” said Cook County Circuit Judge Evelyn Clay, according to The Associated Press . “That little body looked like it had been pulverized from head to toe … her treatment was evil.” \nA month before Gizzell was killed, the Illinois Department of Child and Family Services performed a home visit and ignored clear signs of abuse , according to a lawsuit originally brought by the girl’s family. \nBefore being given to the custody of her father, who died in prison in 2014, Gizzell had been allegedly living happily with her mother, an infant sibling and grandfather.
