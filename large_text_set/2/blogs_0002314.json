House of Representatives \nRecall that the former governor of the state, Mallam Isa Yuguda, and many others had petitioned the Gabriel Onyenwife-led Ad hoc Committee, accusing the state Police Command of colluding with the state government to harass and intimidate residents of the state perceived to be political opponents. \nHowever, appearing before the Committee yesterday, the state’s Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Zaki, explained that his actions were security measures taken to safeguard the life and property of the former governor and the state at large, considering intelligence reports at the command’s disposal, prevailing security threats in the state and the letter from the former governor where he (Yuguda) cited “apparent insecurity in Bauchi, threat of Boko Haram re-establishing their presence in the state and also the hostility of the state government.” \nChairman of the Committee, Gabriel Onyenwife, who promised to give everybody fair hearing, frowned at the absence of key functionaries of the Bauchi State government. \nOn the alleged harassment of people, especially those who submitted petitions against the police, Onyenwife said: “The CP should call his men to order. There should be no harassment, no intimidation of citizens.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:29:39.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
