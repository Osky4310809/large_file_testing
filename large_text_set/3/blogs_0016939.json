She is responding to the Watson comments. \nShe says there is a democratic deficit in the Labour party. Those in positions of power do not reflect the views of the members who voted for Jeremy Corbyn . \nShe says this is a “non-story”. Jon Lansman said nothing surprising, she says. \nShe says this is an attempt to interfere in the Unite leadership elections. \nShe says she considers herself to be a moderate. Corbyn’s policies are common sense. \nShawcroft says she thinks of him as quite rightwing. Share 08:33 \nOn Sunday the Observer published a recording of Jon Lansman, the head of Momentum , addressing a meeting of the pro-Jeremy Corbyn Labour organisation in Kingston. The Observer said it revealed “a hard-left plot by supporters of Corbyn to seize permanent control of the Labour party”. Secret tape reveals Momentum plot to seize control of Labour Read more \nThat prompted Tom Watson , the deputy Labour leader, to denounce Momentum’s plans on Twitter. As the Guardian reports, Lansman hit back. Jon Lansman hits back at MPs over criticism of Unite-Momentum pact Read more \nThis morning the row is escalating. Watson gave an interview to the Today programme earlier, and in it he said the Observer tape revealed “a hard left plan ... to take control of the Labour party”. He said he would be speaking to Corbyn about this, and he urged Labour members to oppose what Momentum was doing. He told the programme: \n[On the recording] Jon Lansman outlined a hard left plan to control the Labour party after Jeremy’s departure ... There was also a plan to organise, to take control of the Labour party. Indeed, he actually said the plan was more important than the election ... \nI regard this as a battle for the future existence of the Labour party. This is high stakes, and I hope my fellow members are going to understand that, and our leader. \nI hope [Corbyn] is going to deal with Jon Lansman ... \nI’m afraid there are some people who do not have our electoral interests at their heart and that’s why I’m speaking out now. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n9.30am: Greg Clark, the business secretary, gives a speech to Policy Exchange on industrial strategy. \n9am: Launch event for the Jo Cox commission on loneliness. \n11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. \n11.30am: Priti Patel, the international development secretary, visits the disaster emergency committee HQ. \n12pm: Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, holds a briefing at Westminster on Scotland’s future in the UK. \n1.15pm: Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, and Angela Constance, the Scottish government’s communities, social security and equalities secretary, give evidence to a joint sitting of the Holyrood and Westminster committees on social security. \n2pm: Sir Tim Barrow, the UK’s ambassador to the EU, gives evidence to the European scrutiny committee. \n2.30pm: Justine Greening, the education secretary, takes questions in the Commons. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T10:40:17.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
