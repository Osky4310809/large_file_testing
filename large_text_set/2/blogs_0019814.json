The company previously courted controversy by scanning customers' Web browsing in order to deliver personalized ads. Customers had to pay at least $29 a month extra to opt out of the personalized ads, but AT&T ultimately ended that program late last year.\nAT&T's letter about the Time Warner purchase also promised these benefits:\nShort-form programming optimized for presentation on mobile devices. Interactive and personalized methods of viewing sports and other live events. Integration of professionally produced content with virtual reality or augmented reality services. Services that encourage consumers to combine professionally produced content with their own creative content and share the results on social media. Greater choice, convenience, and value in programming bundles. Overall, AT&T said the merger will help it provide a more compelling alternative to cable companies.\n“Put simply, this merger is about giving consumers what they want,” AT&T wrote. Customers will get “more attractive bundles of broadband and video services,” and new ways to watch video on any device “with unprecedented levels of customization and interactivity.” AT&T also said the merger will give it incentives to bring 5G upgrades to its wireless network. Further Reading AT&T to end targeted ads program, give all users lowest available price \nTime Warner is a programmer that owns HBO, CNN, Warner Bros., Turner Broadcasting System, and more. It is completely separate from Time Warner Cable, which is now owned by Charter.\nSenators still think merger could harm customers Franken is not convinced by AT&T’s response.\n“While I'm glad they responded to me, their letter does little to address my concerns and essentially asks American consumers to trust that the combined company won’t engage in anticompetitive behavior, raise prices, violate the principles of net neutrality, or decrease access to diverse voices,” Franken wrote on Facebook . “But we’ve seen some of these behaviors before—both as a result of past mega-mergers and straight from AT&T itself. So if I’m being honest, nothing in their letter eases my very serious concerns that this deal will lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service for you.” Further Reading Sen. Franken asks AT&T to prove Time Warner merger is good for customers \nAT&T’s letter to Senate Democrats said the merger “should raise no competitive concerns” because the two companies don’t compete against each other. AT&T said it has no incentive to prevent other video providers from purchasing Time Warner programming, because restricting its distribution would sacrifice revenue and damage Time Warner’s reputation.\nAt a recent hearing , senators and critics of the merger said a combined AT&T and Time Warner might either restrict access to programming or charge rival TV providers a higher price to carry it, which would in turn raise customers’ cable TV bills. Senators also discussed AT&T’s practice of exempting its own video from its mobile data caps while charging rivals for the same privileged treatment.\nAT&T runs one of the country’s largest mobile networks and is the largest cable or satellite TV provider thanks to its acquisition of DirecTV in 2015.\nSen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) remained skeptical after reading AT&T’s letter, saying , “we need an objective review from the Justice Department and the FCC to truly evaluate how merging two massive companies into one behemoth will benefit my constituents and consumers from coast to coast.”\nThe Justice Department must review the merger for potential antitrust problems, and President Donald Trump once claimed that his administration will not approve it “because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.”\nBut the FCC—which can block mergers if they don’t benefit the public interest—is unlikely to be involved. The merging companies’ plan is for Time Warner to shed any FCC licenses that would trigger an FCC merger review.\n“Although our plans are subject to change, we currently anticipate that Time Warner will not need to transfer any of its FCC licenses to AT&T to maintain its business operations,” AT&T wrote. “Almost all of Time Warner’s existing licenses are used only for internal communications anyway; they do not provide FCC-regulated services to the public.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:34:05.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
