Well, the US Attorney’s Office in Boston has you covered.\nFederal officials posted a picture of the jaw-dropping scene on Twitter Monday, just weeks after uncovering the cash during a money laundering bust related to TelexFree Inc.’s $3 billion global fraud case.\n“Photo of $20M seized in box spring following arrest of Brazilian national in scheme to launder proceeds of TelexFree,” the prosecutors’ office tweeted, along with the photo.\nThe image stems from a search conducted on Jan. 4 inside the Westborough, Mass. apartment of Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who was charged in a criminal complaint with one count of conspiring to commit money laundering in connection to the alleged pyramid scheme involving TelexFree.\nAccording to the complaint, the internet phone service company ripped off about half of their participants, or roughly 1 million people across the world.\nIn April 2014, federal agents searched their headquarters in Marlborough — sparking the massive pyramid scheme investigation.\n“Later that day, Carlos Wanzeler, one of the founders of the company, allegedly fled to Brazil, his native country, where he has remained,” prosecutors said. “Wanzeler and TelexFree co-founder James Merrill were indicted in July 2014 on charges that they operated TelexFree as a massive pyramid scheme. Merrill pleaded guilty to those charges in October 2016 and is awaiting sentencing.”\nOn New Year’s Eve, Rocha — acting as a personal courier for Wanzeler’s nephew, who is now serving as a cooperating witness — hopped on a flight from Brazil to JFK Airport, the complaint says.\nHe told customs officials that he was visiting the Big Apple for one week to celebrate his honeymoon, the Boston Globe reported .\nAfter landing, Rocha made his way up to Massachusetts and met Wanzeler’s nephew at a restaurant in Hudson. He received a suitcase with $2.2 million upon his arrival, and then promptly headed to his apartment complex in Westborough, according to prosecutors.\nLittle did Rocha know was that agents had been following his every move, and were able to arrest him, soon-after.\nAuthorities later searched his apartment and stumbled upon the massive stockpile of cash — hidden underneath the mattress and inside the box spring, the complaint says.\nIf convicted, Rocha faces lengthy prison time.\n“The charging statute provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater,” prosecutors said. “Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based on the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.”\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T06:33:08.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
