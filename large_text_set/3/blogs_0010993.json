The Jaggerz in 2014: Paul Martello, Hermie Granati, Chris Patarini, Jimmie Ross, Dennis McAbee and Benny Faiella.   \nThe inductees for the 2017 Pittsburgh Rock ‘N Roll Legends have been announced, and they are: \nModern Era Legend (solo performer or band with 20-plus years in the business): Tommy James and the Shondells , famed for such classics as “Hanky Panky,”“I Think We’re Alone Now,”“Crimson and Clover” and “Mony, Mony.” \nAlthough James is a native of Niles, Mich., where he started his career, it was Pittsburgh DJ Bob Mack that broke “Hanky Panky” as a hit in 1966 after the breakup of his original band, and James formed the Shondells with members of the Latrobe band The Raconteurs. Shondells members Eddie Gray and Mike Vale co-wrote the hit “Crystal Blue Persuasion.” Tommy James and the Shondells were nominated in the category, along with popular Pittsburghers The Clarks and Rusted Root, despite having more than 40 years experience in the business. \nLegacy Legend (solo performer or band with 40-plus years in the business): The Jaggerz , the Beaver County band that went to No. 1 on Cashbox and No. 2 on Billboard in 1970 with the million-selling hit “The Rapper.” Written by Jaggerz member Donnie Iris, it appeared on the band’s second album, “We Went to Different Schools Together,” released on Kama Sutra Records. Iris remained in the band until 1976, then went on to join Wild Cherry and form Donnie Iris and the Cruisers. The Jaggerz are still led by original members Jimmie Ross and Benny Faiella. Also nominated in the category were the Del Vikings, The Vogues and Bobby Vinton. \nMusic Industry Professional Legend (producer, promoter, manager, etc., with 20-plus years in the business): Jerry Reed , the founder and owner of the Beaver studio Jeree Recording, where The Jaggerz, Donnie Iris and the Cruisers, the Iron City Houserockers, The Silencers, B.E. Taylor and Billy Price all made popular records. Also nominated were band manager Charlie Brusco and Andy Warhol, for his work with the Velvet Underground. \nMusic Broadcaster Legend (DJ or VJ with 20-plus years in the business): Chuck Brinkman , the Dormont native and Kiski Prep School grad who was a popular DJ on KQV from 1960 to 1972 (doubling as music director for part of that time), and introduced the Beatles at the Civic Arena in 1964. He went on to become DJ/music director for WTAE-AM and WFFM/WMYG, and he left Pittsburgh for a job in Dallas in 1988, eventually becoming part owner of an oldies station in Greenville, Texas, where he still lives. Also nominated were the late Clark Race and Jimmy Roach, who urged the public to cast their vote for Brinkman. \nIn addition to those inductees, Alan Leeds (manager), Eric Leeds (saxophonist) and Matt Blistan (trumpeter) will be recognized for their work with the late Prince. \nInductees were selected through weighted ballots cast by more than 1,400 registered voters from the general public and the Pittsburgh Rock ‘N Roll Legends Awards Academy of Voters, comprised of more than 200 local producers, promoters, music historians, musicians, media, educators and other music industry professionals. \nThe fourth annual celebration, benefiting the Cancer Caring Center, will be held at Jergels Rhythm Grille in Marshall on April 27. It will feature Pittsburgh’s All-Star Band, with Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers, Billy Price and Frank Czuri, a live and silent auction and video tributes. \nTickets are on sale now at www.pittsburghrocklegends.com at the following levels: \n▪ $200 VIP Level: Two hours of open bar, heavy hors d'oeuvres, special commemorative gift, reserved seating for awards presentation and concert.
