It started out making selfie apps but branched into selling ‘selfie-optimized’ smartphones in 2013. Today it unveiled its latest flagship — the Meitu T8 — which includes a DSLR-like front-facing camera and uses AI to offer ‘advanced beautification.’ \nThe idea of beautifying your photos — smoothing out your wrinkles, lightening/darkening skin as preferred, etc — seems pretty extreme in Western circles, but its the principle that has turned Meitu into a $4 billion company. Its suit of Android and iOS are anchored on a desire to touch up appearances, and they are hugely popular. According to Meitu’s IPO prospectus, its apps — which span photo editing, make-up and streaming — are used by more than 450 million people and process over six billion images per month. They recently got some viral headwind in the U.S., after which it was soon discovered that the core Meitu app collects large amounts of user data . \nThe Meitu T8 takes these principles to a new level. Dubbed “the world’s smartest selfie phone,” Meitu said that its beautification service is powered by artificial intelligence which can sense how it can touch up photos for different people. \n“Instead of the boring skin smoothening and whitening functions that make everyone look the same, [the phone] is capable of optimizing skin colors in a customized way, making sure that the color of the face and the neck stays decently similar,” Meitu CTO Zhang Wei explained to TechCrunch, adding that the feature can apply different types of edits to photos that include multiple people. meitu-selfie-2", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:36:01.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
