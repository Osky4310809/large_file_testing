Matthew DeBord/BI \nSedans, those stalwart four-doors, are falling out of favor. \nIn both the mass- and luxury markets, consumers are shifting their preferences to SUVs. Sales of these vehicles helped drive a new record in the US in 2015, as 17.55 million cars and trucks rolled off dealer lots. More than half of those were SUVs and pickups. \nThat said, sedans are still important products for many companies. One of them is Toyota. \nAt the 2017 Detroit auto show, Toyota and its luxury brand, Lexus, unveiled a pair of new four doors: the mighty Camry, Toyota's most important sedan and one that got a redesign for 2018; and the Lexus LS, also redesigned, and celebrating 28 years on sale in America. \nThese are both \"flagship\" sedans for their respective brands and both carry a heavy weight of expectations. \nMaybe it was just that the Detroit show this year was a little skimpy on excitement, but I grooved on both cars. \nHere's the 2018 Camry. Matthew DeBord/BI \n\"The all-new 2018 Camry is, without a doubt, the most captivating mid-size sedan we’ve ever produced,” Bob Carter, a Toyota VP, said in a statement. \n\"It delivers on everything Camry owners have come to expect from America’s best-selling car, and adds to it, jaw-dropping design, more advanced technology, cutting-edge safety systems, and stirring performance that raises it to an unparalleled level of excitement.\" The new sedan has by far the most aggressive design the vehicle has ever received. Matthew DeBord/BI \nI think it's probably the best-looking Camry ever. The sedan has long been a bestseller in the US, but it's always been knocked for being a boring four-door. \nNo more. \n\"There were three primary design goals when penning the all-new Camry: a distinctive, low center of gravity that results in a firm wide stance; a practical-yet-emotionally styled cabin profile, and a sporty and upscale image both inside and out,\" Toyota said. \nBelieve it not, from my seat Toyota succeeded on all three fronts with the new car. The new car will get three new powerplants. Matthew DeBord/BI \nThe engines on tap include a 3.5-liter V6, a 2.5-liter four-banger, and a hybrid. \nThat covers the Camry's bases quite well. The V6 will provide reasonably peppy performance and make good on that \"sporty\" redesign. The four-cylinder will serve up decent power and good MPGs. And the hybrid will satisfy those Camry buyers who don't think a Prius is enough car for them. \nFor what it's worth, Camrys have enjoyed a near-legendary reliability reputation. My mom owned one and practically drove the wheels off. And here's the Lexus LS. Matthew DeBord/BI \n\"Longer and lower than the sedan it replaces, the all-new LS debuts a strikingly bold design with a coupe-like silhouette punctuated by the Lexus design language,\" Lexus said in a statement. \nFor whatever reasons, Lexus design has been grabbing me lately a lot more than it used to. I thought this new LS was really, really striking. In fact, I think it's better than what BMW currently has to offer. The LS combines sleek, swoopy, and stretched into a compelling visual package. I even like the controversial \"spindle\" grille in this thing. Matthew DeBord/BI \nThere's no gray area with that grille: you either love it or you hate it. \nI used to hate it. \nNow I'm warming up to it. I think this is the best it's ever looked. And yes, there's a new engine. Matthew DeBord/BI \nSo Lexus has crossed the Rubicon with its new flagship LS and done away with the old car's V8. \nA 3.5-liter V6 engine was created \"specifically for the new LS with all-new twin turbos developed through the company’s F1 technology,\" the carmaker said. \nSo how much power does it crank out? According to Lexus, 415 horsepower, which is more than the old LS could manage. \nOn paper, both the Camry and the LS are impressive. Will they connect with the consumer? That's unclear. But they aren't going to drop the ball when it comes to the competition. \nShockingly, they were the two best rides I saw at the Detroit auto show. \nThis is an opinion column.
