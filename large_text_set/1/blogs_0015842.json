For this reason it’s also using an onion site with HTTPS only — also as a backup in case Tor itself is ever compromised. \n“If someday Tor were to be compromised, enforcing HTTPS adds another layer of security for the end user. Similarly, Tor also provides security in case HTTPS is compromised. The notion of HTTPS being compromised is one that we take seriously, considering that there are hundreds of CAs that are trusted by default, with many of them under direct government control in high risk countries,” it writes in a blog about the launch. \n“Thus, by using our onion site, your emails are protected by three layers of end-to-end encryption, there’s Tor’s encryption on the outer layer, HTTPS in the middle layer, and PGP as the final layer of defense for the emails themselves.” \nAnother motivating factor it flags for launching the Tor hidden service is to bolster its defenses against DDoS attacks — given it’s harder for attackers to determine the physical location and IP address of the onion site, so it could offer a workaround for accessing ProtonMail in the event of a sustained DDoS attack taking its web address offline. \nProtonMail suffered a major incident on that front back in November 2015 , with the email service going down for more than 24 hours. Yen tells TechCrunch it still gets major DDoS attacks “routinely”, although he reckons its defenses and network are now able to withstand them “without user impact”. \n“That said, the resistance of Tor to standard DDoS attacks is something that is interesting to us, particularly since DDoS attacks have continually grown in size over the past year,” he adds, although he emphasizes it is still a “secondary motivation compared to the concerns we have about compromises in the certificate authority system and government mandated blocking”. \nProtonMail’s onion site is described as “experimental” at this point, so it’s warning reliability “may not be as high as our standard site” — even above and beyond the typically slower connection Tor users generally get. \n“Even without using Tor, your ProtonMail inbox is still strongly protected with PGP end-to-end encryption , secure authentication (SRP), and optional two-factor authentication . However, ProtonMail definitely has users in sensitive situations where the extra security and anonymity provided by Tor could literally save lives,” it adds. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T11:09:20.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
