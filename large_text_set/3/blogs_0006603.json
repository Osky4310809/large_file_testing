She spent two days inside the bunker before flying out with von Greim and was one of the last people to see Hitler alive before he killed himself.\nAfter being captured by the Americans, Reitsch reportedly said she regretted not having died at Hitler’s side and told her interrogators: “We should all kneel down in reverence and prayer before the altar of the Fatherland.”\nSteven Slimovitch, legal counsel for B’nai Brith’s League for Human Rights, called the choice of Reitsch to promote the aviation week unacceptable.\n“As far as they’re concerned, the fact that she was an incredible pilot, that’s sufficient for them,” he said. “The fact that she appeared in Nazi propaganda in the ’30s and ’40s, that doesn’t seem to bother them too much.”\nMarguerite Varin, who is organizing a Women of Aviation week event Saturday expected to attract nearly 1,000 people to an airfield in Lachute, Que., said she is disappointed to see people focusing on Reitsch’s Nazi connection.\nShe said every year organizers select a pioneer then present a team of female aviators connected to that theme. “Hanna Reitsch was the first woman to fly a helicopter, and this is why this year we decided we will have the team as helicopter,” she said.\nShe said nobody got upset two years ago when the aviation pioneer was France’s Marie Marvingt, who flew in combat in 1917 and dropped bombs on Germans. “I’m not in favour of any war, of any people dying whether on the bad side or the good,” she said.\nShe said she plans to remove a YouTube video showing Reitsch’s helicopter flight from a Facebook page promoting Saturday’s event. And the video will not be shown to the girls who turn up to get a chance to fly.\nRelated This 95-year-old Holocaust survivor has a roommate — a 31-year-old granddaughter of Nazis Jewish groups upset ‘notorious British Holocaust denier’ allowed into Canada to attend neo-Nazi event “I’m not promoting a Nazi. This is not the intention,” she said. “The intention is to have a thousand girls fly free Saturday to experience the world of aviation. That’s what we do. We promote women in aviation.”\nMireille Goyer, the founder and president of the Vancouver-based Institute for Women of Aviation Worldwide, which co-ordinates the week’s events, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. She earlier told CBC that Reitsch was a “great pilot” and that her “controversial part in political history” was not relevant.\n“I looked at everything (Reitsch) had accomplished in terms of piloting skill,” Goyer said to the CBC.\nAir Canada, a sponsor of the event, said it was not involved in the choice of this year’s theme and was not advised of the plan to recognize Reitsch. “Our support is determined on an annual basis, and we will be reviewing it,” a company spokeswoman said.\nMcDonald’s, another sponsor, said a franchisee in Lachute had planned to provide free food and beverages Saturday. “He is reconsidering this support after learning about who the organizers are recognizing,” a company spokesman said.\n• Email: ghamilton@nationalpost.com | Twitter: grayhamilton \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T02:38:52.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
