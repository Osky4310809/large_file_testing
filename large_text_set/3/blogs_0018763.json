Nearly 200 artists participated in The Breasts Art Show at Public Works in San Francisco, fleshing out concepts surrounding breasts, making what is often a perfunctory visual element the focal point. The open-call exhibition, organized by husband and wife duo Ezra and Julia Croft, who actually curated , kept the theme loose, requesting that artists \"create pieces that form an idea about the breast and its place in our lives.\" \n\"It has a lot to do with confronting fears about what people would consider normal and appropriate. In today's charged political climate, it's more relevant now than when I came up with the idea,\" Ezra Croft tells Creators. E.T., 2017, Natalie De Ranieri.

De Ranieri says she named one of them E.T. after her friend whose body she cast the work on said it reminded her of E.T.'s river death scene. \nA series she calls Uovo Fritto was made with the help of her husband. \"I was looking at my husband's chest and I was like, 'Can I cast your boobs?' I was like, that would be such a cool installation,\" De Ranieri tells Creators. \"I took one little pull and he started screaming… I had to wax him basically. The hair came out in the silicone and when I saw it I said that's gonna transfer to the plaster and it's gonna look so realistic.\" The resulting cast is a hairy, and not altogether inedible looking meal, part of a series De Ranieri calls, Uovo Fritto , or Fried Egg .

I enjoy the bond created during breastfeeding and love that we were able to capture that moment. It is such a special image for me. It encompasses so many things I love! I feel like if Frida was able to have a baby, she would have painted or posed in that way. I called that my celebration of weaning because about a week or two after, she stopped breastfeeding,\" says Feliciano.

I think it's kind of a viewing and permission to open the door, and there's some significance to the red door,\" La Deaux says. \nAnother play on words comes in an homage to everyone's favorite middle school calculator code, 8th Grade Math , by Sam Sheldon and Carolina Gallegos.

Layne says the photograph came together at the last minute after the scheduled model bailed on the shoot. \"I quickly approached a young woman in the lobby, also waiting for someone who didn't show,\" Layne recalls. \"She agreed to be my model, without even seeing the set design first. I feel she handled the expression and my random concept perfectly.\" \nWhile much of the work in the gigantic group show was photographic, Explorations by Nicolo Serturio stands out with boobs being smashed, pushed, and pulled, beautifully distorting the standard structures associated with breasts.

I paint my body and imprint into the fabric, capturing different movements and creating many compositions and layers.\" Composition, 2016, Carly Terreson.

Not intentionally referencing the famous work, Polyudova says she was working with concepts involved in stop animation. \nAllison Bouganim , no stranger to works confronting viewers with problematic ideas surrounding the female body, says her goal with the work 3X is to raise questions about political and social issues. \"This piece is meant to dispute the ideals of beauty while also referencing and challenging the porn industry and their depiction of women.\" In Motion, Kira Polyudova.
