China has invested a lot of money in the league and every team now has good players. This will help raise the level of the league and football in the country.” \nHe continued: “I haven’t stayed there a long time yet, just two days in Shanghai, but the impressions were great, the buildings are amazing and it is a very nice city. My priority is to win the league this season.” \nOscar has not completely turned his back on the past, though, as he still maintains an interest in the Premier League. \nHe is hoping to see his former employers at Stamford Bridge go on to claim the English top-flight crown, with Antonio Conte having helped Chelsea to open up a seven-point lead at the top of the table. \n“My focus is on China but I still watch the Premier League sometimes,” Oscar explained. \n“Of course I support Chelsea.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T13:55:25.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
