If she hadn’t have taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So sweetheart, thank you,” Ryan said during his touching speech.\n“To my daughters, I love you. And if I may, I would like to dedicate this to the memory of [Eva's] brother, Juan Carlos Mendes ,” Ryan added. \nCongrats to @RyanGosling , who won #GoldenGlobes Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy! pic.twitter.com/KQUy719r5P \n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 9, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:53:27.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
