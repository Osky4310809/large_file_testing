The actor and comedian is a frequent contributor to the The Project and 7 Days television shows. \nDevcich brings a unique theatrical style and quirky perspective to the stage and is always quick to mock herself. \nWrites has just released her first book Rants in the Dark. \n\"I had a three week old and a toddler and they weren't sleeping,\" Writes said. \"Late one night I was trying to put one down to sleep while the other one was also up. \n\"I wrote a piece I was only going to send to a few friends and I put it up on an old blog site. \n\"It got one million hits overnight.\" \nWrites said the catalyst for her success was remaining relatable to parents by not shying away from writing about the difficulties involved with raising kids. Ad Feedback \nShe described her book as a friend in the night to mums who were still awake in the early hours of the morning. \n\"I saw there were a lot of parents who didn't like being told they had to love every minute of being a mum,\" she said. \n\"I talked to a lot of parents who felt silent that they couldn't talk about the hard stuff. \n\"I'll keep writing as long as people are reading.\" \nWrites said she hoped mothers would turn out in force for a relaxed night without the kids. \n\"I love events like this. They can expect we'll have a great time, a mum's night out and even a few wines, maybe.\" \nFeilding Playcentre's Tracy Pleasants said Writes blog was topical and dealt with real issues. \n\"She writes about stuff that people are thinking,\" she said. \"As a first-time mother I resonate with it - she's like one of us, but can put it into writing and that's a skill. \n\"She talks about her personal battles and she's very open and honest.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:38:50.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
