Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIan Ayre will leave Liverpool at the end of the month and take a break before embarking on a new adventure with TSV 1860 Munich. \nThe boyhood Reds supporter emotionally announced, “I've achieved everything I set out to do here.” \nFollowing more than a decade of service, Ayre will now leave Anfield for the Bundesliga club at a date to be confirmed, report the Liverpool Echo. \nLast March it was announced that Ayre would be leaving the club when his current deal expired even though Fenway Sports Group president Mike Gordon tried to persuade him to stay. \nThe 53-year-old, who played an important part in the new Main Stand project, says Liverpool are in “fantastic shape” as he prepares to embark on a new challenge. \n“When I came here back in 2007, in my mind I set myself some objectives,” Ayre said. “Coming here and seeing how the club was and what was needed, there were three categories.

In my mind, I'd achieved those things. \n“The business is in a fantastic shape in all elements: the structure, the people and the process – everything that goes through there is really in good shape now. And the stadium: putting the Main Stand in place and all that follows, like the new store and everything else. \n“Then the football: the arrival of Jurgen Klopp, the solidifying of the squad. You can’t sit here and wait for the squad to be perfect because you’d be here forever, wouldn’t you? \n“For me, all of those things came into focus and I felt that I’d done the hardest parts and the biggest parts that I can do here. \n“It doesn’t mean I couldn’t have stayed but anyone who knows me well knows that I’m very driven and like to be challenged. I felt that it was less challenging by then and time to give somebody else an opportunity. \n“At different stages, businesses need different energy from people. So this felt natural for me, the right time. The relationship Mike (Gordon) and I have is first class. I’ve always had an open and honest way with him and that has continued.” \nAyre was instrumental in the departure of previous owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett after a turbulent period in 2010 and stayed on to provide stability following FSG's takeover. \nHe transformed the club's commercial revenues and secured a lucrative shirt sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered.

Jordanian businessman Hasan Ismaik, the majority shareholder, has ambitious plans for the German club, who currently sit 13th in Bundesliga Two. \n“I’ll take some time out as I think it makes sense to freshen yourself up and give your mind a bit of peace and tranquillity,” he added. \n“I always said I wanted to finish this before I really focused on anything else so I genuinely haven’t agreed a starting date yet. \n“But they know I’m coming because we’ve agreed a deal. I didn’t leave Liverpool with this on the cards, it’s something that came more recently. \n“What excited me about it when I met Hasan Ismaik, there were some similarities with the Liverpool that came out of the (Tom) Hicks and (George) Gillett triangle of problems, in terms of what needs doing. \n“They need somebody to bring the individual parts of the business and the football club together. \n“They want to bring the club back to the top and do all sorts of things within the club. Hasan is committed to that. \n“That’s exciting – the type of thing that drives me. It’s an interesting opportunity in a different country. When I put all of those parts together, I thought: ‘Yeah, I’d like to go and try that.'” \nA key part of Ayre's role was negotiating transfers but that responsibility has since moved from the chief executive to new sporting director Michael Edwards. \nAyre insists if he had decided to stay put then he would have retained that control but having worked closely with Edwards he has confidence in his ability to get deals done. \n“It was never a factor in my decision. I can safely say that if I had been staying things would not have changed in the way that they have changed,” he added. \n“If I was staying here I would have expected to carry on negotiating transfers and I'm sure Mike (Gordon) would say the same. That was a part of the job I really enjoyed. \n“Look at that team on the pitch the other night against Chelsea, I negotiated deals to bring every one of those players to the club apart from Jordan Henderson. And I negotiated Jordan's new deal. \n“There's a satisfaction in knowing the team you leave is one you played your part in bringing here. \n“It's natural to give that responsibility to Michael because of his experience. We have worked together on a number of transfers.” \nAyre's impending exit has led to a major restructuring of the club's management structure.

Ayre's successor will certainly have less input on the football side than he did. \n“The important thing is that there remains an openness and a dialogue,” Ayre added. \n\"My personal view is that you can't have a 'them and us' in any football club. You can't have a complete separation between what goes on in football and what goes on in the rest of the business. \n“It only works in my opinion when everything comes together as one. I think Mike's role, sitting across the whole group, is very important. \n“The new CEO might not have the same level of involvement I've had in transfers and other football matters but he will still have an involvement.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:46:55.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
