Yes, you read that right. The release of the single comes just days after Khaled announced that his new album, Grateful , was officially on the way. This is the first taste of new music we've heard from both Hov and Beyoncé in 2017. The song is dominated by Bey, with the expected hyped intro from Khaled before Jay comes on to talk that cash shit. Throughout his verse, he raps about having twins with Beyoncé and then even gives 21 Savage a dope shoutout. \"Don't let me have a son, I'm a fool, send him to school in all my jewels,\" Jay raps on the track. For Khaled, this is a major look as he gears up for his next album, which is already rumored to have an appearance from Chance the Rapper who cleaned up at the Grammys on Sunday night. You can stream the track above. Watch Now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:32:05.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
