(Or at least the latest schedule — not all those other schedules .) \nOVO Sound producer/engineer Noah Shebib took to Twitter Friday afternoon to announce the project was delivered. At least we’re assuming he’s talking about the project being delivered and not a pizza for him to eat while he tinkers with the playlist order for another three weeks. Delivered 🌺 \n— Noah Shebib (@OVO40) March 17, 2017 \nShebib had raised eyebrows with another tweet early Friday morning (March 17) that had some wondering if he’d get it in ahead of the March 18 deadline. Almost done… \n— Noah Shebib (@OVO40) March 17, 2017 \nFellow OVO affiliate Oliver El-Khatib alluded it was “loading” with a similar tweet several hours later. Loading…🌺🐝 \n— Oliver El-Khatib (@OlivierElkhatib) March 17, 2017 \nThe tweets come almost a week after the illustrious Toronto artist “promised” he was finishing the projects playlist during A Boy Meets World tour stop in Hamburg, Germany. The release date has been the subject of several broken promises and much speculation, all without even an official tracklist surfacing. Dreezy has, however, kept the fans pacified with tracks like “Hush Up The Silence” featuring WizKid, “Two Birds One Stone,” “Fake Love” and the 21 Savage-assisted “Sneakin’.” \nDue to the monumental success of his last album, VIEWS, OVO is presumably feeling the pressure to top it, which could account for the multiple delays. Perhaps they’re just fine-tuning the final product. Whatever the case, More Life will be here, most likely, before the end of 2017.
