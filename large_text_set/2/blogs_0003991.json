Hats off to the Pats. Great season but would of been great to raise that trophy and have 3M more.\n— Dave Oancea (@itsvegasdave) February 6, 2017 \n\nDave did win $2 million on his bet after the Falcons won the NFC championship but losing an almost guaranteed $3 million in the span of an hour must have been brutal. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:57:36.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
