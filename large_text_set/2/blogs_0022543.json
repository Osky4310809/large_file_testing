Chris Sununu signed Senate Bill 12 into law, allowing law-abiding New Hampshirites to carry their firearms in the manner that best suits their needs.\n“New Hampshire now joins an ever-growing number of states in passing constitutional carry,” said Chris W. Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action. “Despite the best efforts of Michael Bloomberg-funded groups to distort the truth, the New Hampshire legislature and governor stood strong for freedom.\"\nSununu’s signature on SB 12 makes New Hampshire the 12 th state to allow constitutional carry. New Hampshire joins its northern New England neighbors Maine and Vermont, both of which allow constitutional carry.\nInteresting that half the New England states now support a Constitution they ratified centuries ago; only the three southern New England states -- Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut -- do not. Never mind that the region's historic prosperity and technological supremacy were founded upon the firearms industry.\nSponsored by Sen. Jeb Bradley (R-3), Senate Bill 12 will repeal the license requirement to carry a concealed pistol or revolver, unless a person is otherwise prohibited. For those who choose to obtain licenses, SB 12 will also increase the length of time in which a license is valid from four years to five years.\n“It’s encouraging to see a governor stand up for the rights of his constituents, instead of caving to the demands of an anti-gun billionaire from New York City. On behalf of the NRA's five million members, we would like to give a special thanks to Gov. Sununu, Sen. Jeb Bradley and all the statewide gun organizations and NRA members for their commitment in pushing this legislation through.”\nGun owners, of course, must always act responsibly -- but then lawful gun owners tend to act lawfully in the first place.\nNow, if only the NRA would bring its legal forces to bear on the Big Enchilada of unconstitutional ordinances: New York's Sullivan Law . Go get'em.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/02/22/new-hampshire-adopts-constitutional-carry/", "external_links": ["https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170222/new-hampshire-governor-signs-constitutional-carry-into-law", "http://nypost.com/2012/01/16/the-strange-birth-of-nys-gun-laws/"], "published": "2017-02-22T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:21:04.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
