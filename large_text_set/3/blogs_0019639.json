Captain America, in detail.\nSEE ALSO: Sapio, the dating app that wants to help smart people hook up\nDespite growing up just 30 minutes away from each other in Massachusetts, the two met on the set of the upcoming film Gifted, where they started out as just friends and co-workers.\n“At first I was like, ‘What a f*cking nightmare,’ ” the actress told Vulture . “Chris is a different speed than me — I think he really did just jump out of a plane for an interview . And so when he was like, ‘Game nights,’ I was like, ‘This is annoying. This guy’s like a sports guy. He’s the kid that likes P.E.’\n“I remember him saying to me, ‘You’re going to be one of my closest friends.’ I was just like, ‘Man, I fucking hope this isn’t a lie, because I’m going to be devastated if this guy isn’t my friend,'\" she explained.\nEventually, the two bonded off set but when things started to get romantic, Slate hesitated. “If you are a woman who really cares about her freedom, her rights, her sense of being an individual, it is confusing to go out with one of the most objectified people in the entire world.\"\nSlate filled in more details that we don't deserve about Evans and their relationship, saying that he was \"truly one of the kindest people\" she had ever met, explaining that it would break her heart to look at him.\n“He’s really vulnerable, and he’s really straightforward. He’s like primary colors. He has beautiful, big, strong emotions, and he’s really sure of them. It’s just wonderful to be around. His heart is probably golden-colored, if you could paint it.\"\nThe two dated for less than a year, breaking up in February amidst Slate's divorce, but are about to start a press tour together for Gifted . Despite the awkward territory that you might expect from doing press with your famous ex, Slate reads as not too worried.\n“We’re not on bad terms, but we haven’t really seen each other, spoken a lot,” she told the reporter. “I think it’s probably best. I’d love to be his friend one day, but we threw down pretty hard.\"\n\"No regrets, though. Ever.”\n[H/T Vulture ]\nWATCH: ‘Beauty and the Beast’ cast tell us their characters’ musical guilty pleasure", "external_links": ["http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/jenny-slate-gifted-chris-evans-breakup.html?mid=full-rss-vulture", "http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a53656/chris-evans-fights-back/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/bRHLkcb5.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/bRHLkcb5.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-22T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:14:07.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
