Virat Kohli and Team India had a rare failure in Pune but they will look at their predecessors for inspiration ahead of the second Test vs Australia. Kohli will be eager to bounce back after India's crushing defeat to Australia 2 He scored 0 and 13 in the Pune Test 3 He can draw inspiration from Ganguly, who led India to a historic series victory back in 2001 \nVirat Kohli will be eager to bounce back after India's crushing 333-run defeat to Australia in Pune. Kohli, who has been in the middle of a sensational run of form, scored 0 and 13 as Australia steamrolled the world's number one Test team in less than three days. \nCLICK TO WATCH VIDEO \nHowever, Kohli can draw inspiration from Sourav Ganguly, who led India to a historic series victory over the world-beating Australians back in 2001. Sixteen years ago, India were similarly under pressure at home, having lost the opening Test in Mumbai. But then, an unheralded VVS Laxman and a young Harbhajan Singh turned the table for the hosts, who went on win in Kolkata and Mumbai. \nKohli, by contrast, has a far more settled team. Both his spinners - R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are on top of the ICC rankings for bowlers. His pacers, led by Umesh Yadav, have bowled manfully while the batsmen, barring one or two exceptions, are in good form. ( Exclusive: Sourav Ganguly recalls 2001 miracle vs Australia at Eden Gardens ) \nMurali Vijay scored two hundreds against England and another against Bangladesh at the top of the order while Cheteshwar Pujara has been rock-solid, scoring runs against New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. \nKohli of course has been leading the pack with some breathtaking performances. He became the only batsman to slam double hundreds in four successive series before his first duck at home in Test cricket. ( Can Virat Kohli's India repeat 2001 heroics vs Australia? Harbhajan Singh and Nayan Mongia recall Kolkata miracle ) \nWhile Kohli's failure was perhas due given his staggering loss, it was the margin of defeat that hurt all stakeholders in Indian cricket. \nFormer cricketers were pained at the manner of capitulation. India were blown away for 105 and 107 and did not even last 80 overs in both innings combined. \nIn short, Australia, outbowled, outbatted and outfielded India in conditions that were tailor-made for the hosts. The pitch turned square from day one and it was the Australins who dominated Kohli's men. \nThe pitch turned from day one but it was Steve O'Keefe who took more wickets than Ashwin and Jadeja combined. The pitch turned from day but it was Nathan Lyon who looked more dangerous than Ashwin. ( Why Australia's spinners won't threaten India again in this series ) \nBut India can overcome that stutter in Pune and hit back hard in Bangalore, just like Ganguly's team had done at the Eden Gardens. \nKolkata was and continues to be, Ganguly's domain. Kohli has a similar connect with Bangalore, where he turns out for the Royal Challengers. Ganguly's men were yet to taste the highs Kohli's players have tasted. ( Tendulkar confident Virat Kohli and Co. will fight back against Australia ) \nIndia was a team that was still finding its way towards greatness. They had lost a previous home series at home against South Africa and before that, had been whitewashed in Australia. For that team to bounce back and hammer one of the best sporting sides in history, was a massive moment. \nKohli's team on the other hand, has been on a roll. They were undefeated for 19 Tests, starting mid-2015. They won nine out of 12 Tests in 2016 before a rude wake-up call in Pune. Kohli himself said it was not such a big deal, that a victory was never guaranteed. He was right. ( Virat Kohli's captaincy will be tested now: Michael Clarke to India Today ) \nSport is a great leveller. You could be flying high one day and be completely deflated the next. \nThe good thing is that Kohli does not need to look too far for inspiration. Will history repeat itself at the Chinnaswamy next week? That we have to see.
