This one doesn‚Äôt seem to be as widespread of an issue as the Galaxy Note 7 fires, which ultimately resulted in multiple recalls and the cancellation of that phone, but it‚Äôs noteworthy nonetheless. One iPhone 7 Plus owner claims her device went up in flames for no good reason.

Or perhaps there‚Äôs something more dangerous at play here.
