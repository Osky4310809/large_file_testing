His Richard Childress Racing team always brings fast cars here and Dillon clearly knows how to keep his nose clean in this type of racing. \nThe challenge now is to improve from being consistent to being victorious. \n“To take it to that next level, I’ve watched a lot of tape,” said Dillon during Wednesday’s Daytona 500 Media Day. “Seeing what it’s going to take. I sat down with our engineers and crew chiefs, and I think the biggest thing is just getting a little bit more aggressive in the side-drafting department.” \nDillon said that although his Daytona 500 car was slow in time trials, he was pleased with how he drove in the Advance Auto Parts Clash. “It’s probably one of the best drafting races I’ve ever had, I think, looking back at it,” said Dillon. “We put ourselves in a position against two different sets of teammates to have a shot to win.” \nSo now, the big prize is at hand. Dillon won the Daytona 500 pole as a rookie in 2014. This time, he wants to take the race victory. \n“I want to win the Daytona 500,” he said. “Stage points matter, but to me, I’d like to win this race.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:54:14.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
