The opener on most dates will be the Polish extreme-metal group Behemoth. Related Slayer Reflect on 'Seasons in the Abyss' Egyptian Video Odyssey Tom Araya, Kerry King recall playing at Sphinx's feet, bribing locals and rocking out in a tomb \nThe trek will kick off in Bemidji, Minnesota on July 12th and wrap in Phoenix in late August. Tickets for most dates go on sale this Friday, while for two festivals that Slayer and Lamb of God are playing (without Behemoth) – Wisconsin's Rock Fest and Rock USA – are already on sale. \nSlayer are still supporting their 2015 release Repentless , as well as a recently released, like-titled comic book. The group's guitarist, Kerry King, said in a statement that he saw this tour as unique because all the bands are \"old friends.\" \"The potential for greatness at these events is mind blowing,\" he said. \"I look forward to being a part of it, and hanging with old friends – bands as well as fanatical fans! Let the festivities begin!!\" \nLamb of God are also supporting a 2015 release, VII: Sturm und Drang . Singer Randy Blythe echoed King's sentiments. \"This tour is gonna be the feel-good event of the summer: The gigs are gonna be like the Haight-Ashbury during the Summer of Love in '67! OK, so that's complete bullshit. It's gonna be absolutely nothing like that, so don't show up with flowers in your hair looking for free hugs or anything stupid like that. It will definitely be a good fucking time though (as long as your definition of a good time means brutal, caustic and hideously loud music).\" \nBehemoth last put out a record in 2014, titled The Satanist . Singer Adam \"Nergal\" Darski said that he was excited to tour with \"these living legends\" for the trek. \"We are also stoked about coming back to North American shores for the last time before kicking off the next album cycle,\" he said. \"Come and join this extreme metal feast with us!\" \nSlayer, Lamb of God and Behemoth Tour Dates \nJuly 12 - Bemidji, MN @ Sanford Center July 13 - Cadott, WI @ Rock Fest 2017 * July 15 - Oshkosh, WI @ Rock USA 2017 * July 16 - Chicago, IL @ Chicago Open Air Festival July 18 - Columbus, OH @ Express Live!
