Looking for something bolder? Take a look at the new “Really Blue” version, which we have seen launched in the US and Canada already. We now know this blue edition will launch in the UK.\nFor all intents and purposes, this is pretty much the same Google Pixel you already know and love… except blue. Those who want to learn more about the phone can read our reviews on it, but be sure it is a great phone with great specs. These include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 4 GB of RAM, a 5-inch 1080p screen, a 2,770 mAh battery and plenty of other great features. But likely the most exciting factor regarding this phone is the peace of mind you will get from being among the first to get updates and new Android software.\nGoogle Pixel XL review: a Pixel’s perspective Google Pixel review: a technical deep dive Interested? UK residents will be able to get the “Really Blue” Google Pixel starting February 24. This is a limited edition color, though, so interested customers should sign up before stock begins to run out. Pre-orders open up on February 17, so you might as well put your name to one now.\nPrices vary depending on your plan and monthly payments, but you could get it for free, depending on your choice of service. Go ahead and check out EE and Carphone Warehouse for all the details.
