He was to turn 77 approximately one month later on March 12. \nFollowing the reports of his death, his publicity team released a statement via his website . \nAl Jarreau passed away today, February 12, 2017. He will be missed. A few days ago, I was asked to describe Al to someone who knew of his success, but did not know him as a person. I responded with this: His 2nd priority in life was music. There was no 3rd. His 1st priority, far ahead of the other, was healing or comforting anyone in need. Whether it was emotional pain, or physical discomfort, or any other cause of suffering, he needed to put our minds at ease and our hearts at rest. He needed to see a warm, affirming smile where there had not been one before. Song was just his tool for making that happen. \nBorn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1940, Jarreau would go on to release more than 20 projects and amass seven Grammy Awards throughout his career. His hits include the theme song to the 80s TV show Moonlighting , “We’re In This Love Together” and singing alongside countless stars on the “We Are the World” record. His records were also used as the sample base for rap stars such as De La Soul, Little Brother and Three Six Mafia over the years. \nSeveral members of the Hip Hop community and entertainment world reacted to his death early this morning.
