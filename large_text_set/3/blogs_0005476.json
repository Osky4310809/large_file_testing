Now, when users select a filter, the Google Photos app will correct the white balance in an image in addition to the exposure and saturation. Users can tweak things further by going into “Color” and adjusting the warmth and tint. \nSimply put, white balance is a tool used to render colors correctly. Sometimes due to lighting, photos can turn out too yellow, as in the example bellow, or eerily blue. Auto white balance is a staple feature of most cameras and photo-editing tools, and it helps your pictures look better and more natural. Before Auto White Balance After Auto White Balance \nGoogle has been steadily added useful updates to Google Photos since its launch a couple years ago—most recently integrating smart albums and a tool called PhotoScan to digitize old Photos. \nThe product’s main draw is its incredible search feature, which allows users to look for images not only by basic criteria like date and time but also using advanced filters like faces of specific people and simple objects or settings, like “beach” or “watermelon.” \nPhotos is one of Google’s best products in recent memory. The company has used its years of research in search, image recognition and machine learning to make a product that is Google at its best—simple and reliable. \nAuto white balance is rolling out this week to the Android and web apps and will be coming to iOS soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T00:41:32.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
