While there, he signed an executive order halting refugee access to the United States and temporarily blocking immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. (Olivier Douliery/Pool via Bloomberg) First we saw President Trump’s announcement on the wall on our southern border. The unnecessary and counterproductive boondoggle set off a war of words and threats of a trade war with Mexico.\nThen came his immigration announcement. The Post reports :\nThe order was called “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States” and contained a temporary entry ban that would affect citizens of seven countries — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia.\nThe order calls for a halt to the flow of refugees from Syria until further notice and suspends all refu­gee admissions for 120 days until more analysis can determine which countries harbor the greatest threat. The annual intake of refugees for fiscal 2017 would also fall to 50,000 from more than 100,000 authorized now, according to the order.\nThe order also included a new policy that states and localities should have a say in determining whether refugees can resettle there. It calls for the secretary of homeland security to propose a way to make their involvement routine. Governors and mayors, mostly Republicans, have objected to refugees, once they are admitted to the country, being resettled in their jurisdictions, often in small and medium-size cities where the cost of living is lower than it is in big coastal cities.\nIn comments to the Christian Broadcasting Network Trump indicated that special status might be accorded to Christians in Muslim majority countries. Of course, the hundreds of thousand killed in Syria are predominately Muslim.\nThe impact was immediate as refugees were turned back from airports. An Iranian scientist headed for Boston, an Iraqi interpreter who put his life on the line to help American troops, and Syrian refugees fleeing genocide were among the many innocents turned back in scenes that reminded some of Jews fleeing Germany in the 1930s and ’40s. (Trump’s action came on Holocaust Remembrance Day, which Trump marked with a statement that shamefully and inexplicably did not mention Jews.) The move also alarmed European allies , who apparently were blindsided by the move. One federal employee told Politico: “It’s just a stick they’re beating foreigners with, without giving any thought to the diplomatic repercussions. If agencies and Congress had been consulted or even given a heads-up, we would’ve been able to deal with this proactively, and it wouldn’t have been an issue that ginned up the Europeans.” This was a campaign stunt turned into a cruel and destructive policy with no forethought or planning. (“Coming in the late hours of Friday, and with little apparent consultation with other agencies and groups prior to its publication, the order created havoc and confusion among those tasked with overseeing entry into the country.”) The ban goes so far as to include green card holder s.\nThe sheer recklessness and lack of planning should be deeply disturbing. Those closest to Trump seem oblivious to the fact that they are no longer just putting out white papers to please anti-immigrant fringe groups as they did in the campaign.\nSen. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, observed in a written statement: “Our greatest priority is and will always be our national security. The United States has one of the world’s most stringent and thorough processes for the acceptance of refugees — a screening period of at least 18-24 months, involving extensive interviews and background checks. In fact, as numerous national security officials have confirmed, refugees are more thoroughly vetted than any other category of traveler seeking entry to the United States.” He added, “Turning away Muslim refugees but not refugees of other faiths from the same countries also plays directly into the narrative espoused by ISIL and others who seek to harm Americans and our allies — that we discriminate against Muslims. This policy is dangerous, shortsighted, and will harm our alliances and partnerships.”\nUnsurprisingly, a lawsuit challenging the ban was filed on Saturday, certain to be followed by more legal challenges. The American Civil Liberties Union’s announcement explained: “The lead plaintiffs have been detained by the U.S. government and threatened with deportation even though they have valid visas to enter the United States. One plaintiff, for example, worked for the U.S. military and his life was in danger in his home country due to that relationship. The other’s family was also threatened because of perceived ties to the United States.” The director of the ACLU’s immigrant rights program said: “President Trump’s war on equality is already taking a terrible human toll. This ban cannot be allowed to continue.” In addition to constitutional challenges, there are potential statutory claims under laws that bar discrimination against immigrants on the basis of religion.\nForeign policy experts and former intelligence officials blasted the ban. They pointed out that refugees are among the most thoroughly vetted immigrants in a process that can take up to two years. Eighty percent of refugees from war-torn Syria are women and children.\n“Donald Trump’s refugee policy and misguided religion-based preferences are a violation of foundational American values and unsupported by national security realities,” Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer and independent presidential candidate told me. “Sadly, many Republican members of Congress share Trump’s anti-Muslim bigotry, and others lack the courage to oppose it. They will be defined by their silence and failure to use the power the people have vested in them to defend the ideals that are central to America’s economic and security strength.”\nMichael O’Hanlon from the Brookings Institution was similarly negative. “I doubt we need any ban. Our vetting is very good. However, in any case, why ban women with their kids? There have been very few female terrorists and hardly any who are moms,” he told me. “Why ban former interpreters? They have already proven their trustworthiness and we owe them. Why ban anyone over 50? Terrorists over that age are extremely rare.” He added, “It’s sweeping in one sense yet strangely selective in others, not applying to South Asians or Southeast Asians. It smacks of symbolism and in a mean way.”\nAnd Jonathan Schanzer of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies reminded us that “lost in the debate thus far is the very reason for the refugee crisis we are now struggling to contain. There are bloody, complex and overlapping wars raging in the Middle East. We have failed to find solutions to end them for the last eight years, if not longer. The Trump administration does not have the luxury of waiting much longer to address these conflicts.”\nIn the Senate, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) was among those condemning the move:\nWith the stroke of a pen, President Trump’s action has undermined the core values that built this country. It is profoundly un-American to turn away those fleeing horrific violence and persecution or to discriminate against people based on nationality and religion. More than half of the millions of vulnerable citizens seeking refuge from Syria are children, who are today trapped between a brutal regime and violent extremist groups.\nMake no mistake, a ban on refugees from certain countries, paired with the preferencing of religious minorities, makes this a ban on Muslims. . . and top Pentagon officials tell us this ban will be used as a rallying cry for violent extremist movements seeking to attack Americans and American interests.”\nThe action came on Holocaust Memorial Day, but also on the day of the March for Life in Washington, which Vice President Pence attended. Were those (like Pence and Trump’s evangelical base) demanding the country protect innocent life cheering Trump’s cruel disregard for the lives of thousands of innocents in Syria? The lack of humanity tells us something about their priorities and commitment to religious values. (“You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.” Exodus 22:21)\nShamefully, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who previously condemned a ban on Muslims, chirped up with praise for Trump. “President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.” Instead of groveling, Congress should step in to demand the president suspend his directive or face congressional action to swiftly overturn his disastrous move. And for Ryan, the leader who vowed to restore Congress as the maker of immigration law, his statement demonstrated the degree to which Trump has corrupted a once thoughtful and respected figure.\nWe see here a perfect demonstration of what happens when demagogues, with no experience in the White House and no input from serious professionals, take a dubious campaign promise and instantly turn it into policy. (Rex Tillerson, if he had a hand in this, should not be confirmed as secretary of state; if he was excluded, he might rethink his participation in the administration.) Anti-immigrant zealots close to Trump (Stephen K. Bannon, Stephen Miller) have zero understanding of the international ramifications of their irrational and unnecessary schemes (both regarding the wall and on immigration). If Trump is to avoid becoming a failed president and doing immense harm to the country even before he gives his first State of the Union address, he should banish the ignoramuses and find some qualified help.", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?_r=0", "https://twitter.com/@JRubinBlogger", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/27/politics/trump-christian-refugees/", "https://twitter.com/korischake/status/825389436082937857", "http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-immigration-orders-europeans-234299", "https://www.aclu.org/news/groups-challenge-trump-immigration-ban-after-refugees-detained-airports", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-muslim-refugee-ban_us_588cb24ee4b0176377948a09?dzkq7vrl50hzuayvi"], "published": "2017-01-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T04:12:49.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
