He arrived in the league before the advent of League Pass, debuting in the blur that was the 50-game lockout season. He was a bit of joke among basketball fans ... until he wasn't. Dirk didn't have some gradual rise to the top of his field, though he did improve over time. It was more the case that one minute, he was a bust that made us skeptical of European imports. Then all of a sudden, he was magical.\nHe's been magical ever since. On Tuesday he became the sixth player in history to score 30,000 points , dropping 25 on the Lakers in a Mavericks win. Dirk scored the Mavs' first eight points and 18 in the first quarter. He's 38 years old. He's hitting a crazy milestone late in his career and he's still winning games for his team . Nowitzki is a big part of the reason Dallas still has hope for making the postseason despite beginning the season 2-13 and 6-20.\nWatch the shot that got Dirk to the milestone .
