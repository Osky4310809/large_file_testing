He has a very signature thing that he does, and it's impossible to totally lose that with Alter Bridge. \n\"I can hear that going all the way back to the very first record, the thrash element, definitely the metal element. But I think what makes us somewhat unique in that sense that we're very aware of how to have that melodic approach. I'm not a screamer, so I guess that's kind of become our calling card; this metallic approach to riffing but with melody still intact.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:22:00.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
