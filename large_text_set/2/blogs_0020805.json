Dogs always have a special way of capturing our hearts. But when it comes to a dog that’s had a difficult life and desperately needs love, we just fall apart. And that time for today is now.\nBecause we just heard that a veterinarian ate from a dog bowl (after climbing into a cage) in order to show a neglected pit bull named Graycie that it’s okay (and safe) to eat. Here’s how it went down. When she arrived at Granite Hills Animal Care in Georgia, Graycie was dangerously thin and very skittish. Vet Andy Mathis took her under his wing and encouraged her to eat, but when she continued to hesitate — he put himself in her shoes. Literally. \nIf you’re imagining a guy on his hands and knees, eating like a dog — that’s not exactly what happened. He still ate with a spoon, but the human company was all that Graycie needed to eventually feel comfortable about eating from her own bowl.\n& When you have no pancakes for breakfast. . . . \nPosted by Granite Hills Animal Care on Saturday, February 13, 2016 As you can see, Mathis clearly has a way with animals.

And it also happened to be Valentine’s Day. A .\nYou can see that Graycie is almost unrecognizable in this video — in a good way. She looks like a well-cared for doggie with a healthy appetite and zest for life.\n& Graycie Claire Anniversary 2017 Graycie Claire Anniversary 2017\nPosted by Granite Hills Animal Care on Monday, February 13, 2017 Sending so much love to Graycie! She’s come so far, and will no doubt get adopted by a loving family.\nIt was a year ago, Jan 29th, a Friday. . . that this thing showed up. THEN and NOW. #GraycieClaire \nA post shared by Dr. Andy Mathis (@andymathisdvm) on Jan 29, 2017 at 4:08pm PST \nDogs.
