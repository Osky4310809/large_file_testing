This anti-abortion rally takes place every year on or around the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and it has garnered more attention than usual this time thanks to the participation of Vice President Mike Pence. Although President Donald Trump did not personally attend, he has spoken about the rally in recent days and criticized the media for refusing to cover it. Here are some of the best photos from the 2017 March for Life. (Getty) Next Image: March for Life Brendan Morrow is a Heavy contributor who covers news, politics, professional wrestling, and more.
