If you’ve ever driven to a concert, restaurant or any other public place in a major city, you’re probably aware that trying to find a parking space can be a huge hassle. Like, a really huge hassle. That’s why, with the latest Google Maps update, the popular navigation app will start estimating how long it will take to park at your destination.\nRight next to the travel time estimation and distance, you’ll find a little ‘P’ icon that will tell you if parking at that destination will be limited, medium or easy based on historical parking data. Google is rolling out this feature to 25 metro areas throughout the U.S., starting today. The list of metro areas can be found below:\nSan Francisco Seattle Miami Atlanta Boston Charlotte Chicago Detroit Los Angeles Minneapolis/St. Paul New York City Orlando Philadelphia Pittsburgh San Diego St. Louis Tampa Washington, DC Cleveland Dallas/Fort Worth Denver Houston Phoenix Portland Sacramento See also: Best GPS app and navigation app options for Android April 14, 2016 That’s not all, though. The company is also rolling out yet another Google Maps update that will help make it easier to find the hotel that’s right for you.\nNow, when you search for a hotel, motel or other similar lodging, Google Maps will display an album of amenities that you can find at that location. So, if you’re looking for a hotel with a big pool, for instance, this feature could be particularly useful, as you’d be able to check out a photo of the pool without the need to check out the hotel website. It appears most of the photos in these albums right now are provided by hotel websites, but it likely won’t be long until user-submitted shots start appearing.\nThis is likely a simple server-side update, so this feature should already be available to you as long as you’re running version 9.44.0 and above. It’s always a good idea to keep your apps updated, though, so head to the Play Store link below to grab the latest Google Maps update.\nPrevious updates Uber integration and new UI improvements \nJanuary 12: Google has brought full Uber integration to Maps on Android, allowing you to book, complete and pay for an Uber ride directly within the app. There’s also a new interface in Maps that shows the types of ride options you have in a particular location.\nTons of new voice commands \nSeptember 29: A ton of new voice commands are now available within Google Maps on Android, allowing you to mute, show route overview, avoid tolls, and much more, all while using your voice. A full list of the new voice commands can be found here .\nSpeed limit signs \nSeptember 14: While this feature may not be live for everyone, Google Maps has started showing speed limit signs on certain roads. These signs appear as small, unobtrusive notifications on the bottom-left of the navigation display.\nGet it from Google Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T01:08:01.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
