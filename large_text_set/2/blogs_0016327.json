As the lengthy discussion veered into pedophilia, he condoned sexual relations with boys as young as 13 and joked about a sexual encounter he said he had with a Catholic priest as a teenager. \n“You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means,” he told the hosts. “Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.” He adds that consent by minors is “arbitrary and oppressive.” \nA group called the Reagan Battalion was among those calling attention to the interview to highlight its opposition to Yiannopoulos’s speaking role at the upcoming Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington. \nThe reemergence of the video over the weekend triggered a cascade of adverse consequences for Yiannopoulos. \nFirst, CPAC’s organizer, the American Conservative Union, rescinded its invitation to him as a conference speaker. The group’s chairman said in a statement that the organization found his comments “disturbing” and the video “offensive.” \nThen Simon & Schuster canceled an agreement to publish Yiannopoulos’s forthcoming memoir, “Dangerous,” for which it paid him a $250,000 advance. The publisher said it decided to cancel the book – which had drawn protests before the pedophilia flap arose –“after careful consideration.” \nFinally, about a half dozen Breitbart employees told Marlow, the editor, they would quit in protest if Yiannopoulos wasn’t fired or disciplined, according to people familiar with the discussions who weren’t authorized to comment publicly. Breitbart hasn’t made any public comments since the issue arose. \nYiannopoulos, meanwhile, defended himself on Facebook on Sunday and Monday as the tide of controversy rose. \n“I do not support pedophilia. Period,” he wrote. “It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a coordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject.” \nIn an update Monday, he wrote, “I’m partly to blame. My own experiences as a victim led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous. But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, ‘advocacy.’ I deeply regret that. People deal with things from their past in different ways.” \nHe added: “I am certainly guilty of imprecise language, which I regret.” \nYiannopoulos’s self-named “Dangerous Faggot” speaking tour has sparked protests on college campuses for the past year, including one earlier this month at UC Berkeley that turned violent. In reaction, Trump threatened on Twitter to cut off federal funds to the school if it “does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:58:51.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
