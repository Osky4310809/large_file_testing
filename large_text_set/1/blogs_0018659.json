He always asks our opinion and says at the start of team meetings that he doesn't want to dig anyone out or start any arguments, but that we are all here to reach the same goal and we are all together. 'So if anyone has something to say they shouldn't be scared to say it because the gaffer wants to get to the bottom of it. We are grown men who have got the same goal. It's a results-driven industry and the meetings only help.' Ironically, one of the reasons given for 34-year-old Barton's abrupt departure from Rangers earlier this season was a confrontation with team-mates, but Lowton says his forthright attitude is not viewed as a problem at Turf Moor. Burnley boss Sean Dyche encourages full and frank exchanges with his players after games Burnley have struggled to pick up points away from home this season 'Joey and the manager have the same work ethic and same drive,' said Lowton. 'They are both very confident guys who want to help other people. They have a winning mentality. The group here have all bought into that. 'Joey is always on it day-in, day-out. He's always bullying people up, making sure we are in the right positions. His experience can only help us.' Burnley's results this season have a remarkably lopsided look to them with 25 of their 26 points gained at home. Lowton admits Burnley need to improve their form away from home this season However, their last two away matches at Spurs and Manchester City have resulted in improved performances and narrow 2-1 defeats. After facing Arsenal, the next matches on their travels are against Watford, Hull, Swansea and Sunderland, described as 'winnable' by 27-year-old Lowton. Despite the travel sickness, Burnley are healthily placed in mid-table, having been tipped for relegation before the season started. Lowton can also take personal heart from being part of the Villa side which shocked Arsenal 3-1 at their place on the opening day of the 2013/14 season. The Clarets have taken just one point away from Turf Moor in the Premier League this season 'We knew Arsenal were going to have a lot of the ball as they probably will on Sunday but we held a good shape, stayed in the game as long as we could and got a couple of penalties on the break,' recalls the right-back, who rates Philippe Coutinho as his toughest opponent. 'This season we have come up against teams who have had a lot of the ball against us. We seem to work better like that. 'Liverpool had a record amount of possession against us but we stuck to what the gaffer told us and on the break we are dangerous any time with Andre Gray's pace and willing runners in behind. Burnley travel to face Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon 'I might be up against Alexis Sanchez and sometimes you have to pinch yourself. But whoever they are, that goes out the window at the start of the game. I've got a job to do and it's my career I'm trying to move forward. We've got to get in their faces and stop them.' Lowton has previous when it comes to facing big-name opponents. In 2012, he kicked Wayne Rooney on the ankle during Villa's 3-2 defeat against Manchester United, causing the striker to pull out of England's friendly in Sweden a few days later. 'My dad wasn't too happy with me about that,' smiles Lowton. 'But for 90 or 95 minutes I can't have too much respect for anyone I'm playing against.'
