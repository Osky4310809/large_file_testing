Davos 2017: Theresa May says globalisation must work for everyone - live Read more \nMay’s warning that businesses needed to address the issue of executive pay and that market forces alone would not ensure the spread of prosperity to all ensured her first appearance in Davos was met with only lukewarm applause from her well-heeled audience. \nThe prime minister said that “across Europe , parties of the far left and the far right” were seeking to exploit the sense among people on modest incomes that globalisation was not working for them. \n“I want to set out a manifesto for change that responds to these concerns and shows that the politics of the mainstream can deliver the change people need,” May said. \n“Because talk of greater globalisation can make people fearful. For many, it means their jobs being outsourced and wages undercut. It means having to sit back as they watch their communities change around them.” \nFollowing the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, responding to growing populist pressures has been a feature of this year’s Davos. May said both governments and business had to do more to address the concerns of those who felt that “those who prosper seem to play by a different set of rules”. \nMay said: “If you’re just getting by, you don’t want a government that gets out of the way, you want one that will help you.” EU politicians and businesses warn May over 'difficult' Brexit Read more \nBusiness had to do more to spread the benefits of free trade and globalisation to more people. “It means playing by the same rules as everyone else when it comes to tax and behaviour,” she said, “because in the UK trust in business runs at just 35% among those in the lowest income brackets. And it means putting aside short-term considerations and investing in people and communities for the long term. \n“It means businesses paying their fair share of tax, recognising their obligations and duties to their employees and supply chains, and trading in the right way; companies genuinely investing in – and becoming part of – the communities and nations in which they operate, and abiding by the responsibilities that implies; and all of us taking steps towards addressing executive pay and accountability to shareholders.” \nMay said she rejected the prevailing orthodoxy that the best thing government could do was to get out of the way. Problems would not just solve themselves if business was left to get on with the job. \nOutlining the government’s rationale for a more interventionist approach, she said: “Our strategy is not about propping up failing industries or picking winners, but creating the conditions where winners can emerge and grow. It is about backing those winners all the way to encourage them to invest in the long-term future of Britain.” \nMay said her aim was to deliver jobs and economic growth to every community and corner of the country. “We can’t leave all this to international market forces alone, or just rely on an increase in overall prosperity. \n“Instead, we have to be practical and proactive – in other words, we have to step up and take control – to ensure free trade and globalisation work for everyone.” \nTwo days after outlining her approach to Brexit, the prime minister adopted an emollient tone towards Britain’s EU partners, saying that it was “overwhelmingly and compellingly” in Britain’s interests for Europe to succeed. This is Brexit poker - and Theresa May was right to up the stakes | Simon Jenkins Read more \nShe said Britain had voted with “determination and quiet resolve” to leave the EU. “Let us not underestimate the magnitude of that decision,” she said. “Britain must face up to a period of momentous change. It means we must go through a tough negotiation and forge a new role for ourselves in the world. It means accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for our country’s children, and grandchildren too. \n“We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again.” \nShe said Britain was a racially diverse nation, welcomed inward investment and played a leading role in the UN and other global institutions. \n“By instinct we are a great trading nation,” May said. “We seek the freedom to strike trade deals with old friends and new allies around the world.” The prime minister said talks had already started with Australia, New Zealand and India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T13:30:24.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
