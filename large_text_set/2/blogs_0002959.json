They will also visit the Mexican Plateau and Chile's Atacama Desert before heading to Antarctica. \nAfterward, they plan to fly to Africa via Brazil, visiting Ethiopia and Kenya. The adventure will end in China in June after several stops in Southeast Asia. \n\"Many of the countries we want to go to are visa-free or visa-on-arrival for Chinese nationals,\" Zhang said. \nOnly about 200 people are thought to have completed a round-the-world flight, but it is the first time a Chinese-made plane has been used for such a journey, according to Zhang. \nThe couple ran several small businesses before starting On the Road in 2013. The show attracts many viewers on video-streaming website Youku Tudou. \nThe third season was filmed along the ancient Silk Road and saw them visit 16 countries, including Afghanistan and Iraq.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:10:11.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
