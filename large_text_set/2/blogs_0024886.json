She has just been named in the Australia Rugby Union under-18s team Youth Commonwealth squad.\" \nIt will be the fourth time the Highlanders have made it to the tournament and Muller said the team was hoping to better their previous performances. \n\"We've been lucky enough to make three finals but we just haven't got over the line yet,\" she said. Promoting talents of regional rugby players \nCQ Black Magic Rugby Sevens team manager Jade Smith said the competition would help promote regional players on a national stage. \nHe said there were more than 80 Indigenous rugby union players living in central Queensland. \n\"[That] is a lot considering rugby league is the biggest sport in Australia and we're all pretty much raised to watch the State of Origin,\" Smith said. \n\"There's no actual sevens competition here in central Queensland. \n\"You have to travel to Brisbane or Sydney but all the boys have the talent up here and I guess this is the opportunity that we're trying to provide with Black Magic.\" \nSmith said at each tournament in which they competed, they promoted a different health message which had helped improve the team's well-being. \n\"A lot of the boys [are into] smoking and drinking [but] having to train for a national Indigenous carnival, they've cut back, they've done their health checks,\" he said. \n\"They're trying to better themselves because we're going to be playing on a national stage, in front of a national audience. \n\"That's what we want to see our in community and in our Indigenous mob â€” that you don't have to be drinking all the time to have fun. \n\"You can train well, look after yourself and still have the benefits of being with your mates.\" Women's rugby getting more attention since Olympics \nMuller said many female Indigenous players had relocated to Brisbane to further their sporting careers. \n\"Unfortunately, there are more opportunities down in the city than there are out in the country, out in rural areas,\" she said. \n\"We built the team [the Highlanders] because we wanted to give the girls out in the rural and country areas an opportunity to thrive in mainstream.\" \nMuller said the code had seen an influx of new players in recent years. External Link: Highlanders FB post \n\"I think it's starting to get more interest after the Olympics and [because of] how well the women's program has developed over the last couple of years,\" she said. \n\"They're world champions, they're gold medallists and now everybody is getting into that sport, especially young girls and women right across Australia.\" \nMuller said finding new recruits from regional centres was made easier by existing players. \n\"We probably have a base of 55 [players who] actually notice girls back in their home towns and they get in touch,\" she said. \n\"That's all it takes from our girls because we want them to identify other young girls in their own communities.\" \nBoth teams say funding tournament trips was the biggest issue for them and Muller said this had meant she paid for the majority of all the costs herself, but the teams are hoping to secure sponsors. \nThe competition will take place on Friday March 3 and Saturday March 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:11:18.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
