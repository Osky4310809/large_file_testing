Image copyright Suffolk Roadsafe Image caption The signs are in response to criticism of Sheeran's song lyrics \nSgt Chris Harris, from Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing, posted a plea on Twitter for people to \"slow down on Suffolk roads\" in response to the line \"driving at 90 down those country lanes\". \n\"I don't think it specifically says miles per hour,\" Sheeran told the BBC. \"It could be kilometres per hour.\" Image copyright Twitter Image caption Police asked drivers to slow down on Suffolk's roads Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The star released two singles simultaneously to announce his comeback in January \nThe singer's decision to erect the signs coincides with the release of his third album, รท. \n\"We have a marketing spend for this album and I wanted to do some sort of billboards in Suffolk,\" Sheeran said. \"We thought it would be quite funny instead of having billboards saying the album is out, just having a blue sign that says 'drive safe'.\" \nThe singer also said he was not too disappointed that Castle on the Hill failed to swap places with Shape of You in the chart, as he hoped it eventually would. \n\"For me it's all about the live show, having songs that react well, and having a song that's been in the top five for eight weeks will definitely go down well at a live show,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T11:00:56.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
