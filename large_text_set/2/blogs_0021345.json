While the name Fitbit is practically synonymous with activity monitors, Garmin’s trackers boast attractive designs, thoughtful details, and cool features. And as it happens, a number of Fitbit and Garmin fitness trackers are sold at very similar price points. We’ll be comparing price-equivalent Fitbit and Garmin models, so if you know how much you want to spend on a fitness tracker, we’ll be able to tell you which fitness tracker model has the edge at that price point. Read on to see how three of Fitbit’s best trackers compare against similarly-priced fitness trackers from Garmin, or check out our fitness tracker comparison post pitting Fitbit vs. Withings . \nStill can’t decide what fitness tracker is right for you?

(Fitbit) \nAs of this writing, Fitbit’s 2015 line includes six trackers: two clip-on wearables, and four wristband activity monitors. Fitbit’s “Everyday Fitness” trackers are their entry-level products. That category includes the Zip ($59.95), the One ($99.95), the Flex ($99.95), and the Charge ($129.95). If you are a bit more athletic and need a heart rate monitor, the Charge HR ($149.95) is probably going to be your best fit. The Fitbit Surge ($249.95) is the most premium offering, and includes advanced features like GPS and HR monitoring. There’s also the new-for-2016 Fitbit Blaze , a wearable with a full touchscreen experience, and the ability to use GPS when paired with your smartphone. The Blaze should last up to five days with continuous heart rate monitoring and activity tracking before needing a recharge. Those who like a slimmer look, lots of optional wrist bands, and custom watch faces may find that the new Fitbit Alta is the right option for their lifestyle, which also has five day battery life. \nGarmin’s core lineup of fitness trackers includes the base model vivofit ($79.99), the newer vivofit 2 ($99.99), the sleek vivosmart ($149.99) with smart notifications, and the robust vivoactive ($249.99), an ultra-thin GPS smartwatch. It’s also worth pointing out that Garmin offers GPS running watches, such as the Garmin Forerunner 220 . You can read more about that watch in our post on the best heart rate monitor watches . As the line between fitness trackers and running watches continues to blur, you might find that either option is well-suited to meet your needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:06:25.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
