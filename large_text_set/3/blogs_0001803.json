His next court date is March 8. \n“This morning, the Australian federal police arrested a 42-year-old man in the New South Wales town of Young in relation to terrorism offences,” Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said . “Police will allege that the man arrested has sought to advise Isil on how to develop high-tech weapons capability.” \n“We’ve seen Australians arrested for preparations to carry out terrorist acts or providing financial assistance to terrorist groups, we’ve seen Australians travel to the conflict zone to take up arms for (ISIS),” Turnbull said . \nTurnbull added that Zahab was not planning a domestic attack. \nPolice relied on intelligence from within the Muslim community to nab Zahab. \nThe arrest is a result of 18 months of investigation, and follows two months after Australian authorities foiled a major terror attack planned for Christmas Day in Melbourne. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T08:40:28.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
