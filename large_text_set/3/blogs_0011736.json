This was a hugely exciting launch because the shades ran the gamut from chartreuse and marigold to vermilion and turquoise. However, with the advent of chrome, metallic, and glitter pouts becoming incredibly trendy, we knew that it wouldn't be long until MAC infused a little more flair into these edgy shades. \nAs it turns out, we barely had to wait to see those suspicions manifest into reality. From March 23 to May 4, the brand will be selling its all-new Metallic Lips lipstick collection. The 18 shades (which will cost $17 each, the same price as the original lipsticks) will be infused with sparkle and pearl to create a metallic-matte look. \nThere's a glimmering emerald green and a foiled sapphire for those who want a more modern mouth and more classic colors like pink and red tricked out with shimmer. But if you're looking to get cyborg chic, there are plenty of silver, bronze, platinum, and copper hues to choose from. \nKeep reading to see the stunning shades before shopping them on March 23!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T10:15:19.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
