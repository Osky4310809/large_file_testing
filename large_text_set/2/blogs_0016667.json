We’re putting the piece together still.” \nContinuing, she went on to say that she wanted to release a few more singles first, as she doesn’t believe that people have the same concentration span that they used to.\nOpening up to Capital, she said, “I think I want to put out some songs first before I give them the full meal. I think we are digesting things in bite-size these days and that’s what we can handle.” \n“[W]hen someone has a 17 or 19 track album, you’re like, ‘Oh my God, I have to take a trip to Mars to listen to your record in full!’ I mean I love you, you’re my favorite dope artist, but, like, we want bite size,” she added. “We, like, only read headlines. We don’t even read the whole story!” ✨#Versace...on the floor #thebrits2017 #chainedtotherhythm✨ \nA post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Feb 22, 2017 at 3:57pm PST \nPerry also teased that there were some surprises guests on the album that “you probably couldn’t guess,” and also spoke about the meaning behind her new single “Chained To The Rhythm.”\n“I’m fortunate enough to remember a time before we were all living our lives through a lens. But there is a generation who will never have a reference point for that, which is kind of scary, because I know that all of the intake we do on social media and how we read the news,” she said. “It’s really differently kind of rewiring our brains and our attention span and stuff like that. Bad habits are being formed. We’re thinking we’re connected and we’re communicating, but we’re so divided — it’s just like, oh, where do I start?! “Turn on Black Mirror .” 🥀I never promised you a rose garden🥀 @adamselman \nA post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Feb 22, 2017 at 4:43pm PST \nDon’t take *too* long though, yeah?\nKaty Perry’s “Chained To The Rhythm” is available to stream and download now.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:46:37.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
