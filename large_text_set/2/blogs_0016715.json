I still don't believe it! Such a funny guy, too many memories! “ \nPeople living in the area say the victim was either in, or close to, a black Mercedes he had been driving when he was shot. \nThe man was taken to hospital as large numbers of police, including armed officers, arrived in the area. He died soon after. \nPolice have now launched an investigation into the incident, and are urging anyone with information about it to contact them.

I've never heard of a shooting here. I'm shocked.\" \nOn Monday, a 25-year-old man was seriously injured when he was shot in the street in the Shiregreen area of Sheffield. \nEarlier this month, a pensioner couple were shocked when shots were fired through their living room window in the Southey Green area of the city - an incident that police said was almost certainly a case of a gunman getting the wrong house. \nThese incidents followed two more in January which both involved shots being fired at houses in the same street in High Green, Sheffield.
