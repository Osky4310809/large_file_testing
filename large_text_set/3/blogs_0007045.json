Unless you know someone from the Caribbean who would be calling you, numbers that start with 473 or other area codes from Caribbean islands are likely to have a scam artist on the other end of the line. That’s because Caribbean phone numbers use the same country code (+1) as the U.S., so the numbers look domestic even though they’re international calls. \nBecause those 473 calls are international, if you call or text those numbers it will cost you a premium per minute or message. In order to get you to call them back, the scammers will call and hang up immediately in quick succession. They might ask you to text them back, too, or pretend someone on their end of the line is in danger and needs help. \nThe key is not to give in to your curiosity. If someone really does want to get ahold of you, they’ll probably leave a voicemail or call back. If the call is not coming from your area code, it’s less likely that it’s a call from someone legitimate whose number you don’t know—like a doctor’s office or your pharmacy. \nThis type of scam doesn’t always come from a 473 number. These, as Steinberg writes, are some other international area codes that you might think are from the U.S. when they pop up on your phone: \n242: Bahamas 784: St. Vincent and Grenadines 246: Barbados 473: Grenada, Carriacou, and Petite Martinique 809, 829, and 849: Dominican Republic 264: Anguilla", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:28:51.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
