She grew annoyed and started being “curt,” according to Starbucks.\n“She was mildly irritated, but she was still pleasant with me,” Richardson said.\nIf there was a rudeness scale, “It was like a 2 on a scale of 10 for me,” he added.\nBut the woman felt so guilty, she came back the next day and handed him a card.\n“I need to apologize,” she wrote. “Yesterday at your drive thru we had a less than cheerful encounter. At no fault of yours, you said you could not take my empty cup (trash). I was less than understanding. My manner was curt,” read the card, which was signed “Debbie.”\nShe added, “The thought of leaving a trail of unkindness like that is so not the path I want to reflect.”\nShe encouraged him to “Keep up your attitude of cheer and hope” and added, “You taught this ole Lady something yesterday.”\nThe barista was stunned because he’d barely thought twice about the interaction.\n“She was so nice and so kind. I just really wasn’t expecting that. It was very, very heartwarming,” Richardson said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:09:39.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
