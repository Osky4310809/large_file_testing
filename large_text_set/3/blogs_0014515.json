Manchester City manager gives instructions to John Stones during the match against Monaco \nGuardiola had said before the game he felt attack would be the best form of defence but, having left Yaya Toure on the bench, City could not create a midfield platform for their forwards to operate effectively. \nThe City manager said: \"All managers make mistakes but I don't think it was down to a tactical mistake. \n\"It's simple. The difference was between the first and the second half. In the second half we tried to win the game, we tried to play. I did it all my career in that way.
