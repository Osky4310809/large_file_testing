I knew he had a good reputation for working with younger players and, after we met, I felt more comfortable to sign for Dortmund. I think I made the right decision.\" \nMkhitaryan will be taking on his former boss on Sunday and he has nothing but good memories of his time with the German. \n\"He was always next to you if there were playing problems or life problems. He is a good person,\" he added. \nConte 1-0 Costa as Chelsea respond \n\"In particular, he helped me a lot because I was thinking too much about football. I took defeats too seriously, I would obsess about any chances I missed. He told me that it is just life and I had to let it go because when the next chance comes, I needed to be in the right frame of mind to take it. \n\"I learned to realise that everyone makes mistakes in life and you cannot worry on the pitch. You have to forget about it.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:28:06.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
