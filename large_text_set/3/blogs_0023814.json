The country’s last three goals have been converted from the penalty spot. \nJuric, against Saudi Arabia, was the last goal scorer from open play. \nThis is the 25-year-old FC Luzern striker’s time. \nWhether he is flanked by two speedsters, or partnered with a striker playing off him, or leading the line in a front three that might have someone narrow on one side, like Troisi or Luongo, and someone wider on the other, like Kruse or Leckie, it is imperative he takes the initiative and is a presence up front. media_camera Tomi Juric. \nOf course there is the ‘fall-back’ option of Tim Cahill, chasing his 50th goal and 100th cap (currently 48 and 94), but given he doesn’t have 180 minutes in him, it is not realistic to continue to depend on him for key goals. \nUnder Postecoglou, Cahill has scored 20 goals from open play. \nJedinak has 12 goals, including eight penalties, and Tom Rogic, who is not playing, five. \nLuongo is the only other player in the squad who has five goals or more under Postecoglou, but, Juric’s confidence is building. This campaign, he has been involved in half of Australia’s goals: with two of his own, and two assists. \nMIDFIELD PERMUTATIONS \nRogic’s absence, plus the context of a crunch away qualifier against a desperate and talented Iraqi outfit, makes Postecoglou’s selections even more intriguing. \nThere’s no question that Mile Jedinak will anchor the midfield. He is in form at Aston Villa, despite playing a bit of centre-back recently, and a key Postecoglou lieutenant. media_camera Mile Jedinak ahead of the Socceroos World Cup qualifier against Iraq in Tehran, Iran. pic Mark Evans \nAaron Mooy, blossoming at Huddersfield Town , will accompany him in midfield. According to Fox Sports Lab , he tops the side’s charts in possessions, completed passes, balls into the area, crosses attempted and completed as well as effective tackles. It is critical he is in the mood; he has 17 shot assists, 12 more than the next most this campaign. \nBut will they be joined in a ‘three-man’ midfield, a 4-4-2 diamond, which is a surprise that has been sprung on a couple of occasions because of a desire to dominate possession and exhaust opponents, or something entirely surprising? \n“It’s hard seeing Postecoglou go for a more defensive option in midfield after losing Rogic to injury,” former Socceroos playmaker Ned Zelic told foxsports.com.au. \n“Although the Roos have had a few issues in away games during the qualifying campaign, where two No.10s have started, it will still be the favoured formation due to Postecoglou’s attacking philosophy and the need to get three points.” \nGiven Postecoglou all but confirmed that Kruse won’t play both games, could a Troisi or Luongo play further forward, opening a spot in the middle of the park for another contender? Mark Milligan’s calming influence and ability to keep the tempo ticking has been missed in midfield in recent games, while Jackson Irvine could not have done more in club-land to make a case for inclusion. media_camera The Socceroos warm up during a training session. \nDEFENSIVE RISKS \nThe last three games has been the longest streak without a clean sheet since January 2015, and there’s a few further causes for concern. \nTrent Sainsbury isn’t playing club football at Inter Milan, Rhys Williams was even surprised himself by his recall and Milos Degenek has to be a chance of playing right-back given Rhyan Grant is a novice at this level. Sainsbury is another Postecoglou hinted won’t play both games; will he be prioritised at home, or away? Could Milligan be deployed in the heart of defence at some point? \nBrad Smith is a favourite of Postecoglou but Aziz Behich is playing regularly in Turkey. \nIf you had to bet you’d say Mat Ryan will have Milos Degenek, Trent Sainsbury, Bailey Wright and Brad Smith ahead of him. media_camera Rhyan Grant. \nThere had been some whispers that Postecoglou had been trialling a back three; hence why Rhys Williams was drafted into the squad. That would certainly be a fresh approach to shock everyone! \nAPPROACH \nThe Socceroos were undoubtedly sluggish in their final games of 2016. Gone was the concern about finding solutions when teams sit back and cede possession, because against Thailand, the side was so ponderous with the ball and slack without it that it created a new headache. \nThey cannot afford a repeat of that against a desperate Iraq side. \nThere’s no question Postecoglou will demand the side bosses the ball in neutral Tehran and returns to the proactive, intelligent side they were on the road to becoming. \nBut one error, counter attack or piece of Iraqi brilliance later - on a bumpy pitch that will make fluent passing difficult – and it will truly test Australia’s mentality, particularly if they are still searching for a precious goal. media_camera Coach, Ange Postecoglou. \nIt has hard to predict what he will do: the reveal of his XI will be fascinating. \nAnd striking the right balance has never been more critical because … \nWHAT’S AT STAKE \nThe Socceroos enter the second-half of qualifying NOT in the automatic qualifying spots. Destiny is truly in Australia’s hands but dropping points to Iraq, who sit fifth, after the draw in Bangkok, against last placed Thailand, is simply not in the plan. \nJapan and Saudi Arabia currently occupy the top two spots, with United Arab Emirates level with Australia. \nWhile Australia is in Iran playing Iraq, Thailand host Saudi Arabia and Japan travel to UAE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:58:10.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
