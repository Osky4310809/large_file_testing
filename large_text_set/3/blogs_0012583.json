Dickson: You are taking sides with Sheriff, we are worried Adeyeye to Gov. Dickson: You are taking sides with Sheriff, we are worried On 7:27 pm In News , Politics by Nwafor Polycarp Comments \n…..Adeyeye task Gov. Dickson on impartial reconciliation \nThe People’s Democratic Party (PDP) National Caretaker Committee has charged the Chairman of the party’s Reconciliation Committee to ensure justice in the discharge of its task. \nThe committee is headed by Gov. Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa. \nThe Publicity Secretary of the committee, Mr Dayo Adeyeye, gave the task in a statement issued on Monday in Abuja. \nAdeyeye said that the party’s attention was drawn to a statement where Dickson called for the resignation of the committee members as a way out of the current impasse in the party. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Dayo Adeyeye \n“It is shocking and embarrassing that the statement is coming from one of the party’s most respected governors. \n“To successfully accomplish the task of reconciliation, it is important to be seen by all sides as an impartial honest peace broker. \n“We are worried that Gov. Dickson has seriously undermined the work of his committee by taking sides with Sheriff. \n“We are even more concerned about his open declaration of war on the national caretaker committee. \n“Rather than reconciling, the party is being further pulled apart,’’ Adeyeye said. \nHe said that the national caretaker committee did not appoint itself, as it was a creation of the May 2016 National Convention of the party, which Dickson was part of. \n“As the Governor admitted in his statement, the national caretaker committee was put in place and enjoys the support of over 80 per cent of members of the Party. \n“That being the case, the proper thing to do if Dickson wants the national caretaker committee to be disbanded is to persuade and convince the 80 per cent of the members on the merits of his point of view. \n“The national caretaker committee is merely the agent of the Party. \n“The principals are the organs of the Party and the 80 per cent of members that he alluded to. \n“The national caretaker committee has no choice than to obey the command of its principals.’’ \nAdeyey added that it was therefore most unfair for Dickson to cast aspersions on members of the caretaker committee when he knew where to direct his efforts. \n“He should convince our principals who are the organs of the Party on the need for the NCC to resign. We cannot and will not do his job for him.’’ \nAdeyeye said the committee was amused that Dickson wanted them to surrender the destiny of PDP to Sheriff who, he said, brazenly destroyed the party chances in the Edo and Ondo states governorship elections. \nHowever, he reiterated that the members of the committee would quit once the party organs that set it up directed that it should be disbanded.
