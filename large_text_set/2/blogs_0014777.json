On my assumption of duty as Vice Chancellor in last February, the first major challenge I faced was how to bridge this need gap. The need gap so highlighted is more in the faculties and disciplines of Engineering, Management Science and Education which were hitherto not available. \n“This challenge was overcome when the NUC, graciously approved 16 new additional programmes, which increased the university carrying capacity from 1500 to 2500, this singular achievement enabled the present administration to frog leap a student population of 2000 to this swarm, cherished and honoured number in 2016/2017 academic session.” Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:48:05.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
