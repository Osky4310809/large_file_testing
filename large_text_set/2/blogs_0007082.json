Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure won the award for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Special Venue Project. \n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure is an all-new, innovative ride experience developed specifically for Shanghai Disneyland . The spectacle experienced on the ride is on a grand scale and involves technology that has never been used before in a theme park attraction. It includes a highly advanced propulsion system that provides unprecedented control over the position and rotation of boats carrying guests through large, dimensional set pieces combined with large-scale media screens. Integrating media produced in collaboration between Walt Disney Imagineering and Industrial Light & Magic with advanced animated figures and newly developed special effects creates a highly immersive experience. \nThis marks the second major industry award following the announcement last fall by the Themed Entertainment Association that the attraction won the Thea Award for Outstanding Achievement â€“ Attraction .\nThis year the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disneyland park is celebrating its 50th anniversary. Guests can also enjoy the classic attraction at Magic Kingdom park, Tokyo Disneyland and re-opening later this year at Disneyland Paris .\nCongratulations to everyone involved for this exciting achievement!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:06:37.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
