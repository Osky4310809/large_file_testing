The students, who were handing out pocket copies of the U.S. Constitution with Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) in September, were arrested and put in jail for \"trespassing.\"\n\"All public colleges — which are supposed to be the 'marketplace of ideas' — have the duty to protect and promote the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech,\" declared ADF Legal Counsel Travis Barham in a statement on the case. \"Ignoring this duty, KCC arrested these club supporters for exercising this freedom, and, ironically, for handing out copies of the very document — the Constitution — that protects what they were doing.\"\nNot only did KCC set up and enforce a \"speech code\" which violates the First Amendment, but the college also refused to apply this code to other organizations, such as the LGBT group Spectrum, according to the lawsuit. This kind of blatant ideological discrimination is unacceptable, as is the campus trend of regulating free speech to certain \"zones.\"\nThe unlawful jailing happened on September 20, 2016, according to the lawsuit. On that date, KCC students Brandon Withers and Michelle Gregoire were handing out pocket Constitutions, along with Isaac Edikauskas, vice president of the YAL chapter at Michigan State University, and Nathan Berning, a field representative at the Leadership Institute. The four intended to recruit students to join the budding YAL chapter at KCC.\nAt first, an administrator came by, informing the group that they needed a permit to \"solicit\" on campus and that they needed to go into the Student Life building and reserve a table. When Gregoire explained that this was their First Amendment right to speak and hand out literature, the administrator said it would be fine. Five minutes afterward, however, Drew Hutchinson, manager of student life at KCC, came by and asked them to shop.\n\"Do you like freedom and liberty?\" one of the students asked a passerby. Hutchinson attacked this conversation-starting question as \"provocative,\" and insisted that this question obstructed students' access to education.\nRevealing a classist bias, Hutchinson added that students from \"rural farm areas ... might not feel like they have the choice to ignore the question.\" He noted that many students \"are growing up on a farm, or they don't have wifi, they don't have internet, you know it's a very different situation.\" This paternalistic approach is offensive, as is the notion that students who grew up on a farm need to be \"protected\" from the Constitution.\nVIDEO: UC Berkeley Students Violently Stop White People from Crossing Bridge\nAfter Berning told Hutchinson that he and his colleagues had a First Amendment right to speak there, the director of student life stormed off.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/18/michigan-students-jailed-for-handing-out-constitutions-fight-back/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.adfmedia.org/files/YAL-KelloggComplaint.pdf", "http://adflegal.org/detailspages/press-release-details/student-club-supporters-arrested-for-handing-out-us-constitution-at-michigan-college-adf-sues"], "published": "2017-01-18T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:58:53.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
