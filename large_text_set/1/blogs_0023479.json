Crew members will have to learn how to operate new types of spacecraft and adjust to planetary surfaces with different microgravity environments. \nAs part of this research,   Engineers Peggy Whitson from NASA and Thomas Pesquet from ESA started Monday morning with an interactive test on an iPad. The test is part of the Fine Motor Skills experiment that observes how astronauts interact with new technologies potentially influencing the design of future spaceships, spacesuits and habitats. \n  worked throughout the day on science hardware. He rebooted a computer on the MERLIN science freezer before swapping hard drives on a device that observes meteors entering Earth’s atmosphere. In the afternoon, Kimbrough videotaped himself reading a children’s book and performing a simple light experiment for school kids on Earth. \nThe three cosmonauts, Oleg Novitskiy, Andrey Borisenko and Sergey Ryzhikov, worked in the station’s Russian segment on a variety of science and maintenance tasks. The trio explored the human digestion system and collected blood samples for a bone loss study  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T23:31:36.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
