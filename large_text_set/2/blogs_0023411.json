Established in the early 19th century by the British as the summer headquarters of the Chennai government, Ooty now draws tourists wanting to escape the stifling summer heat. \nAlthough the railway was proposed in 1854, it wasn't completed until 1908 as the rocky terrain and thickly forested hills made the work difficult. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005. Route \nThe Nilgiri Mountain Railway is located in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu. It runs from Metupalaiyam to Udagamandalam (Ooty), via Coonoor, in the Nilgiri Hills. The track is 46 kilometers (28.5 miles) long, and passes over 250 bridges (including 32 major ones) and through 16 tunnels. This railway is particularly picturesque because of the surrounding rocky terrain, ravines, tea plantations, and forested hills. Coonoor, with its world famous teas, is a tourist destination in itself. \ncontinue reading below our video Before Your Road Trip, Watch This See: Top 5 Places to Visit Tea Plantations in India Train Services \nOne toy train operates along the Nilgiri Mountain Railway from Metupalaiyam to Ooty. The engine is an 'X' Class steam locomotive, made in Switzerland. It pulls quaint blue and cream wooden carriages with large windows. The engine is changed for a more powerful diesel one at Coonoor, to provide greater traction for the steep climb up to Ooty. \nBoth first class and second class seating are offered on the toy train, and it's worth buying a first class ticket to have a more peaceful and less cramped journey away from the crowds. It's also possible to get unreserved tickets at the counters if you arrive early enough. \nThe most spectacular scenery and best views are situated along the stretch from Metupalaiyam to Coonoor. Hence, some people prefer to only travel along this stretch. Read Reviews of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway on Tripadvisor Timetable \nThere's only one toy train departure daily.
