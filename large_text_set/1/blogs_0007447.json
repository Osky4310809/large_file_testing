All rights reserved More From Cosmopolitan If bath bombs were edible, they'd be Unicorn Tears - a non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic mystery drink created by Dapper Coffee in Singapore. Metallic blue with a hint of green and a lot of edible glitter, this magical drink is served in a bottle that says \"shake to sparkle.\" The cafÃ© makes it fresh daily, and their website says it's \"Pure tears of joy from Sparkles, our pure bred Mongolian Unicorn.\" Regardless of not knowing what's actually in it - as much as I'd like to believe unicorns are real and they cry sparkly blue tears, I'm a little skeptical - people on social media are really into Unicorn Tears. In a live taste-test on Clicknetwork - a Singapore TV network Facebook page - people described the drink as smelling and tasting like lemon, and that it's very sweet. Others who have tried it on Instagram say it's sweet, and some even say that it tastes like a cocktail, even though it's non-alcoholic. This isn't the only sparkly secret drink Dapper Coffee has thought up. In the past, they made limited-edition Merlion Blood and rose gold Unicorn Tears. They even make a Gold Brew , which is sweetened coffee with, of course, edible glitter. One bottle of Unicorn Tears costs $10 on the Dapper Coffee website - the catch, though, is that you have to pick it up in store. So, $10 plus a flight to Singapore. I'd argue that it's worth it. I mean, look how pretty it is when you shake it up! Do it for the Insta? Do it because it's magical and maybe will give you unicorn-like powers? Either way, I'm sold. ðŸ¦„âœ¨.
