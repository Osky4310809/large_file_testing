File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - The national government’s debt pile continued to rise to P6.208 trillion as of end-February mainly due to the impact of peso’s depreciation against the dollar, the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) reported yesterday. \nThe BTr said the national government’s outstanding debt in February rose 1.5 percent from the end-January level of P6.115 trillion. \nDomestic debt accounted for the bulk at P3.985 trillion, while the rest, or P2.223 trillion came from external creditors. \nAccording to BTr data, domestic debt during the period slightly went up 0.8 percent from P3.95 trillion recorded in January. \n“The increment was primarily due to the net issuance of government securities amounting to P31.68 billion and the effect of peso depreciation on the value of onshore dollar bonds amounting to P0.25 billion,” the BTr said. \nDebt sourced externally, likewise, rose 2.8 percent in February from P2.162 trillion as of end-January.   \nThe BTr attributed the increase to peso’s depreciation against the dollar, which increased the peso value of the country’s external debt by P21.64 billion alongside net availments worth P39.31 billion. \n“These more than offset the impact of third currency depreciation against the dollar amounting to P0.22 billion,” The BTr said. \nThe national government’s total guaranteed obligations as of end-February amounted to P521.3 billion, up 0.5 percent from the January level. \nThe increase was due to the effect of currency fluctuations and net availment on external guarantees, which amounted to P3.48 billion and P0.21 billion, respectively. \nThe BTr said these amounts outpaced the P0.97 billion net repayment on domestic guarantees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T11:43:55.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
