It might not sound fun to give yourself something to do on vacation, but a creative project like a photo walk or travel journal can make the experience that much more memorable. \nA project might not sound like a good way to relax, but pushing yourself to be creative can help you recharge. Even if you’re not artistic, you can still find a creative project that will add to your vacation. For example, make a gallery wall with postcards or pictures from your trip . If you are artistically inclined, having a project, like watercolor painting, could shape your trip since you’ll seek out paint-worthy scenery. If you don’t want to bring equipment, sign up for a local art or cooking class at your destination. Besides giving your trip purpose, you’ll also end up with a unique reminder of your vacation that you can put on display when you get home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:06:56.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
