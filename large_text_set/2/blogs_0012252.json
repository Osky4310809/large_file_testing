As per the Geekbench listing, the SM-G390F seems to be running Android 7.0 Nougat using the 14nm Exynos 7570 processor and 2GB of RAM. It has been close to two years since the Galaxy Xcover 3 was unveiled, and its successor has long been due. \nThe Galaxy Xcover 4 would be the first smartphone to use the Exynos 7570 processor. The chipset, which was announced back in August 2016, features a quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU, Mali-T720 GPU, and a fully integrated Cat. 4 LTE 2CA modem. Since Samsung claims that the chipset supports up to 720p displays, thereâ€™s a high chance of the Galaxy Xcover 4 featuring a 720p or an even lower resolution screen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:37:42.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
