Lacy Clay (D-MO) hanging a painting in the US Capitol that showed police officers as animals, specifically wild boars. The painting was chosen by Clay as the winner of a student art competition, and had been hanging in the hallway for months before the St. Louis Police Officers Association called it a “punch in the mouth” and demanded it be taken down. \nWhile Clay refused to take the painting down, much to the consternation of police officers and conservatives, a GOP lawmaker decided to take matters into his own hand. This is actually now a piece of art in itself. The curling wires are such a perfect subtractive technique. \nAmazing use of negative space. pic.twitter.com/fDsJKYR4Go \n— Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) January 6, 2017 \nRep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) told Fox News today that he personally took down the piece of art because he “was angry.” \n“I’ve seen the press [reporting] on this for about a week or so,” Hunter said. “I’m in the Marine Corps. If you want it done, just call us.” \nThe Republican Congressman also said he delivered the piece to Clay’s office and that if Clay puts it back up, Hunter’s “allowed to take it down.” \nAside from the uproar from the St. Louis police officers, a number of other law enforcement associations sent a statement to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan demanding the painting be removed, saying the following: “This false narrative portrays law enforcement professionals as posing a danger to the very communities we serve. That is untrue and this ‘art’ reinforces this false narrative and is disrespectful on so many levels.” \nWatch the clip on the story above, via Fox News. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:57:38.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
