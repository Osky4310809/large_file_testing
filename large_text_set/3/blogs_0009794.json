My husband is planning ‘an accident’ in my car, brake failure and serious head injury in order to make the path clear for him to marry Camilla.” \nMr Burrell said that the fears expressed in the letter came to her after she visited clairvoyants. \n“Some of these thoughts did come from mystics but you can’t get away from the fact that she wrote it. She took time to sit down and actually write down her fears.” Princess Diana's butler Paul Burrell comes out as gay 0:33 \nPaul Burrell was Princess Diana's butler for ten years, and she was said to be the only person who knew about his sexuality.
