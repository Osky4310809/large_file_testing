Gov. Gavin Newsome, according to Breitbart , Brown wondered, “Where do you get the extra money? This is the whole question.” \nPointing out that overall medical care costs in California reached a total of nearly $450 billion, or roughly 18 percent of the state’s gross domestic product, Brown stated, “I don’t even get it. How do you do that?”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:04:58.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
