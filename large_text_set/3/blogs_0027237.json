News programs 60 Minutes and 48 Hours also got early, unsurprising pickups, as did Survivor , its long-running reality series. \nConspicuously absent? Criminal Minds and its spinoff, Beyond Borders; struggling Elementary ; and critically derided 2 Broke Girls , along with likely cancellations The Odd Couple, Code Black and first-year shows The Great Indoors, Pure Genius, Doubt and Training Day , some of which have already been pulled from the schedule. \n'Kevin Can Wait,' starring Kevin James, will also be back in the fall.
