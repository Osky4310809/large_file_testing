Nothing is more defeating to a wide receiver (than) when you’re lined up and the corners and linebackers are saying ‘Watch the dagger route! Watch the dagger route!’… You’re like, ‘They know the plays.’ \n“So you’re running the route and going, ‘Joe (Flacco), you better not throw this ball!’ They do a great job. Their scouting department does a great job keeping you on your toes, and they take away your bread-and-butter plays.” \nDespite this disadvantage, Smith did enjoy some success against the Patriots. He famously bested Aqib Talib during the “Ice up, son” game in 2013 and also got the better of Darrelle Revis in the 2014 divisional round, catching a touchdown pass in the Baltimore Ravens’ 35-31 loss at Gillette Stadium. \nSmith played one final game against New England earlier this season, catching four passes on six targets for 57 yards and no touchdowns. \nThumbnail photo via David Butler II/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:28:36.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
