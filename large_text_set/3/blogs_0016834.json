Teads \nFrance-based video ad tech startup Teads has been snapped up by Dutch telecommunications company Altice for around $322 million (€300 million), several sources told Business Insider. \nTeads will become a division of Altice following the transaction, making it the latest in a string of ad tech companies — from AOL and Yahoo to Verizon , Turn to Singtel , and Tapad to Telenor — to be acquired by a telco. \nTelecoms firms have increasingly become interested in ad tech firms as their repositories of verified subscriber data are highly valuable to advertisers looking to target particular segments of consumers with their online ads, as well as to measure whether those ads led to effective outcomes. \nBoth companies declined to comment when contacted by Business Insider. \nThe French ad tech company is known as the pioneer of the outstream video ad format — where video ads appear within the context of an article and autoplay when the ad is viewable on screen. \nThe format has been jumped upon by publishers because it allows them to offer highly lucrative video ad inventory without needing to create video content for it to appear in front of. \nFounded in 2011, Teads raised $55 million in funding, according to CrunchBase . The company said it generated $200 million in revenue in 2016 (most likely a gross, rather than net revenue figure), which represented 39% organic growth year-on-year. Teads said it has also been EBITDA (earnings before income, tax, depreciation, and amortization)-positive for the past four years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:15:24.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
