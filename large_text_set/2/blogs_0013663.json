We are less concerned with social approval,\" Sueur told AFP. \n\"It's not that the fear of a ticket is bigger in Japan than in France. It's that people (in Japan) are more concerned about the opinion of others.\" \nThe role of group behaviour on pedestrian traffic is a major factor in safety, the study found. \nSuch research \"could help target specific preventive, culture-specific solutions for pedestrian safety,\" it said. \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 300,000 pedestrians lose their lives on the road every year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:42:41.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
