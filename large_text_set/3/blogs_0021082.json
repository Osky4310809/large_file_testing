Advertisement More by this Author Emotions ran high in Kagochi Village of Subukia, Nakuru County after a woman who had gone missing for 17 years resurfaced on Sunday. Neighbours flocked Mr Philip Mwange’s home to confirm the news as they sang songs of praise to God for the return of their daughter. Ms Esther Mwikali, who is now 31 years old, went missing in 2000 when her parents gave her out for employment as a househelp. “A woman from Kisii visited our home and offered me a job as a househelp and I travelled with her,” she said. Ms Mwikali told the Nation that her host turned against her after a while and started mistreating her. \"She started mistreating me by beating me up and denying me food. I had to eat food prepared for the dogs,\" said Ms Mwikali After nine months of perseverance, she met a woman, while on her way to fetch water from the river, who offered to rescue her. Contrary to her expectations, the new host also turned against her and started mistreating her and she again went looking for a new home.

So I followed her and I went back to school since I had dropped out while in Standard Three,” she said. After completing her secondary school studies, she met a man who married her in 2016. “One of my friends approached me and offered to help me trace my family. “After searching for weeks, I got contacts of my mother who asked me to come home immediately,” she said. Mr Joseph Mutungwa, Ms Mwikali’s elder brother, said they searched for her by all means including circulating her photographs but it was all in vain. “Whenever we met someone from Kisii, we sought to find out if they had any information about our lost sister. At some point we gave up,” said Mr Mutungwa. Her mother, Ms Anna Kalunde, said she had given up on ever finding her sixth born child. “I kept praying to God and I believed she was alive even though I was not sure of ever meeting her,” said Mrs Kalunde.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:32:58.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
