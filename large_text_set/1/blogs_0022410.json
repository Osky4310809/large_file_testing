We have had a good service during the morning peak. We ran the full five train service because drivers turned up for duty. \n\"This was a major relief for thousands of passengers and we thank those drivers.\" Strike action: Commuters queue for Tube services during a 24-hour walkout (Andrew Phoenix) \nThe RMT ordered a 24-hour strike today, which began at 9pm last night, among its Central line drivers in protest over what it claims was the “forced” move of eight of its members to different train depots. \nLondon Underground warned on Wednesday the walkout would also prevent the Waterloo & City line (known as The Drain) from operating all day because it uses the same staff pool. \nThe strike, however, meant sections of the busy Central line, used by up to 800,000 passengers a day, were without service. \nThe disruption was far worse than predicted by Tube chiefs with no service east of Leytonstone or between Marble Arch and White City west bound. Rush hour commuters face havoc after Tube walkout \nThere were severe delays over the rest of the line. \nThe Central line service will remain uncertain all day with Tube bosses only able to run trains depending on last minute driver availability. \nRMT pickets were on duty at the Hainault, Leytonstone and Loughton train crew depots persuading their colleagues, including those of the rival Aslef union not in the dispute, from reporting for duty. \nThe strike is in protest at what the RMT claims is a move to “force” eight of its driver members currently based in the east of London to other depots, including Earl’s Court.
