The cricketer suggested players should not be travelling to games on planes (Photo: Arsenal FC via Getty Images) \n\"The gulf is getting wider and wider and wider and I just look at Arsenal and the lowest match day ticket is £27, which doesn't sound too bad. \n\"The highest is £97. You're telling me you're a fan, you've paid somewhere between that for a ticket, you're turning up, you're getting a train to the match. \n\"You're spending £50 on travel, you're spending to park your car, and then you find out they're flying to Norwich on a private jet!\" Flintoff picked Arsenal out for criticism (Photo: Arsenal FC via Getty Images) \nSuggesting the fans' money is going towards these extravagant travel arrangements, Flintoff adds: \"Sort it out, how can you look at your fans in the eye? \n\"How can you look at them when you're wasting god knows how much on travel?\" \n* Freddie Flintoff on his BBC Radio 5 live podcast \"Flintoff, Savage and the Ping Pong Guy\" with Robbie Savage and Matthew Syed - out every Monday on 5 live. poll loading Will Arsenal finish in the top four? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:56:41.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
