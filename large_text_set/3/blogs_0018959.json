ID: 10728444 1. Someone said “Beetlejuice” three times, so Josh appeared on the boat alongside #PoorAmy to take on the screamin’ sisters, Kelsey and Amanda, in the cruise ship sudden death. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10728447 2. Anyway, Josh immediately got stuck into making sweet, sweet love to a fish. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10728472 3. Meanwhile the sisters were having an intense conversation about… literally anything. View this image ›\nChannel 7 THEY TALK SO MUCH. And that’s coming from ME, someone who got told to be quiet 15 minutes into a three-hour road trip!!! (You knew what you were getting yourself into, James.)\nID: 10728485 4. Josh and Amy got right back to their uncomfortable ways, constantly bickering with each other. It was, as always, super awkward. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10728493 5. Big Boy Joshy then sprayed the whole kitchen down with his shit-talking, you know, for something new and different. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10728498 6. The judges and other teams were all seated in the dining room from the Titanic. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10728504 7.

Unfortunately for us, Seafood King and Amy were doing pretty well - even though they were still being absolute dicks to each other. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10728721 10. By the dessert round, the sisters’ spirits were pretty broken, and it was awful. View this image ›\nChannel 7 Kelsey and Amanda were loud, but always lovely, and their food was usually at a high standard!\nSadly, they only scored 26/60 while Josh and Amy scraped by with a total of 28/60.\nID: 10728741 11. Next was the SAUCE CHALLENGE! Teams had to make a sauce, and the winning one would be sold in stores. The guest judge for this challenge was Curtis Stone. Take it away, Thirsty Mama Val: View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10735073 12. Josh made a big fuckin’ deal about cooking with chicken. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10735137 13. Mell and Cyn faced a challenge early on, as they found out they were going to be cooking in a Coles. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10735167 14. We got a brief insight into Tim and Kyle’s friendship. View this image ›\nChannel 7 THAT WAS A REAL Quote: .\nID: 10735219 15.

I love them.\nID: 10735283 16. Josh and Amy had some tortilla troubles. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ZING.\nID: 10735371 17. Married heterosexuals Brett and Marie are still in the competition. View this image ›\nChannel 7 Lmao.\nID: 10735540 18. While Curtis visited Josh and Amy’s station he noticed their chicken was pretty much done. Josh was like “nah” and kept cooking it. TURNS OUT THEIR CHICKEN WAS OVERCOOKED LMAO. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10735607 19. My legendary faves, Thirsty Mama Val and Courtney, won the sauce challenge. View this image ›\nChannel 7 Queen Mother.\nID: 10735648 20. Unfortunately, Court and Duncan and Mell and Cyn were the two teams who were sent to the next sudden death cook-off. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10735666 21. Mell and Cyn decided to cook risotto which has been referred to as “the dish of death” because EVERYONE FUCKS IT UP. View this image ›\nChannel 7 Everyone fucks it up.\nID: 10735919 22. While the teams cooked, Josh stood on the sidelines running his big, beautiful fish mouth. View this image ›\nChannel 7 Remember how he believes he’s in a feud with Court and Duncan, but in reality Court and Duncan just think he’s a dickhead like LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET? Well, Big Boy Joshy wouldn’t shut up and everyone got sick of his shit…\nID: 10735986 …INCLUDING HIS WIFE. View this image ›\nChannel 7 POOR AMY.\nID: 10735996 23.

Luckily, married whatshername had some really great wisdom to share. View this image ›\nChannel 7 Sure thing mate.\nID: 10736121 25. While Court and Duncan struggled with plating their desserts, Big Brave Joshypants was still harping on from the sidelines. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10736140 26. The desserts weren’t as bad as both teams feared, but Court and Duncan were victorious. Mell and Cyn scored 34/60, while the happy hipsters nabbed a whopping 50/60! View this image ›\nChannel 7 It was sad to see the busy business women go, they were brilliant competitors who hated everyone else on the show and I loved them for it.\nID: 10736176 27. Also look at this comparison of scores from Court and Duncan and their Seafood King nemesis from the week’s sudden death rounds. View this image ›\nChannel 7 Here’s hoping Joshy has to put his money where his fish is (his mouth).\nID: 10736173 28. Next, the teams went to “eat street” which was just a street where they had to cook out of shipping containers. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10744286 29. Being in a random residential street seemed like an advantage for one of the teams, that’s for sure. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10744351 30. Josh and Amy’s menu board made me laugh really hard. View this image ›\nChannel 7 A TASTE OF BROOME, WA!!! LAKSA???? THIS IS VERY FUNNY, YOU GUYS.\nID: 10744386 31. Over at the Anchor and Palm restaurant, David plated up his balls once again.

The married heterosexuals ran into a bit of trouble with their beef cheeks. If you listened carefully, I’m pretty sure you could hear one of the producers saying, “are those two part of the show? Do they just live on this street?” View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10744709 35. Josh and Amy’s Laksa (a taste of Broome, WA!) was apparently great. Ugh. That might have something to do with Josh not being allowed in the kitchen. View this image ›\nChannel 7 ID: 10744776 36. Despite all that, Tim and Kyle were the people’s choice for the day, making them the big winners. View this image ›\nChannel 7 Sadly for the footy friends, Mark and Chris, they will be returning to Kitchen HQ to face the married heterosexuals for a sudden death cook-off next week.\nID: 10744783 Coming soon the teams will all get together for SUPER instant restaurants.
