Andrew Cuomo announced Thursday. \n“By bringing Wi-Fi and cell service underground ahead of schedule, we are reimagining our subway stations to meet the needs of the next generation,” Cuomo said in a statement. \n“This will better connect New Yorkers who are on-the-go and build on our vision to reimagine the country’s busiest transportation network for the future. I thank all of our partners.” \nAll four major carriers — AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless — will work, officials said. \nTransit Wireless spent $300 million to install the service and will share revenue from the networks with the MTA, according to the governor’s office. \nAlmost every station already has service, with the final one, Clark Street in Brooklyn Heights, set to go live on Monday. \nFour other stations are under renovation or about to undergo renovation — South Ferry, Prospect Avenue, 53rd Street and Bay Ridge Avenue — and will provide service after completion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:35:53.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
