Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGabriel Jesus has returned to Manchester and could make his comeback before the end of the season. \nJesus is progressing well from the broken metatarsal he suffered last month, which has interrupted his stellar start to his Manchester City career. \nHe recently flew to New York to carry out commercial work for City and enjoyed a trip home to Brazil before returning to the UK on Thursday. \nThe Brazil striker is still wearing a protective boot and using crutches following an operation in Barcelona on his foot, carried out by Pep Guardiola's favourite surgeon Dr Ramon Cugat. \nJesus, who was pictured driving around the Trafford shopping centre on a mobility scooter, was ruled out for up to three months initially and City hope the Samba star could return to action in May.
