I suspect we’ll have a w hole bunch of mixed up presidents at some point where nobody really knows what we’re gonna call then.” \nBut Obama didn’t shy away from highlighting some of the specific issues that sow systemic inequality–like the lasting legacy of Jim Crow laws in modern measure that make it harder to vote. \n“The reason that we are the only country among advanced democracies that makes it harder to vote is–it traces directly back to Jim Crow and the legacy of slavery,” Obama said. “And that’s not who we are. That shouldn’t be who we are. That’s not when America works best.” \nHe continued: “ This whole notion of voting fraud, this is something that has constantly been disproved, this is fake news.” \nRather than the polls being flooded with people trying to vote who aren’t eligible–a fallacy stoked by the Republicans behind voter suppression measures –Obama said the opposite is true: That plenty of Americans who are eligible to vote don’t cast ballots. \nBut Obama ended his last meeting with the White House Press Corps on a positive note, telling reporters, “I believe in this country. I believe in the American people. I believe people are more good than bad.” \n“At my core, I think we’re gonna be OK, we just have to fight for it, we have to work for it, and not take it for granted,” he said. \nWatch a clip of Obama’s remarks on race below via ABC News: Pres.
