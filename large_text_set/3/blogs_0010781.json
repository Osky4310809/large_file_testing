It was the host side who eventually held their nerves as Ireland slid to a 28-run defeat on Sunday (March 12). Mohammad Nabi was the star performer for the hosts as he crunched a power-packed 30-ball 89, including three sixes and a boundary off the final over bowled by Barry McCarthy. \nIn pursuit of a mammoth target of 234, Ireland gave Afghanistan a scare before losing the game. It was Paul Stirling's 49-ball 20 that had kindled sparks of life into Ireland's chase. After thumping Shapoor Zadran for a four and a six in the first over, Stirling proceeded to play with a fair amount of freedom by collecting two boundaries and a six in the next over bowled by Amir Hamza. \nHe then pitted his talents against the wily offspinner Nabi, and unfurled a series of shots. At 64 for 1 in the fifth over, Ireland seemed to be in the hunt to overhaul the target. However, Shapoor, who had come in for severe punishment at the hands of Stirling, had the last laugh when the opener whipped one straight to deep square leg. Nabi, who had dropped a couple of catches to give Stirling reprieves, breathed a sigh of relief at the fall of the opener's wicket. \nStuart Thompson 43 (18), Stirling's opening partner, then took over by landing big hits off Nabi and Shapoor. At a crucial stage of the game, Hamza castled Thompson in the sixth over to peg the tourists back. With Kevin O'Brien (3), the broad-shouldered all-rounder, getting out to a soft dismissal off Karim Janat, Afghanistan gained the upper hand. \nWilliam Porterfield (16) and Andy McBrine (13) couldn't make much of an impression as Ireland slipped further to 159 for 5. With 75 runs required off 38 balls, Afghanistan looked set to complete the whitewash. However, Gary Wilson's (59 off 34) provided the perfect tonic to lift the tourists' sagging spirits. Afghanistan, on the other hand, didn't help their cause with some ordinary fielding. The point can be capsulized by Wilson being dropped in the 15th over. \nAt the end of the 18th over, with Ireland needing 35, the visitors had an outside chance of registering a memorable win. It was Afghanistan's 18-year-old teen sensation, Rashid, who put paid to such hopes by chiselling out Wilson, Greg Thompson and Lorcan Tucker in the penultimate over. Nabi then closed out the match by dislodging the last man George Dockrell as Ireland hurtled to their fifth successive defeat against Afghanistan in the shortest format. \nEarlier, Nabi conjured up a brilliant half-century to propel Afghanistan to a massive total. He came out to bat at the fall of Najibullah Zadran's wicket in the 13th over and took his time to gauge the conditions. For a while, the spin duo of Dockrell and Jacob Mulder seemed to have put the brakes on Afghanistan's scoring rate. \nNabi then lifted the tempo with a couple of fine shots off Dockrell. He also took a heavy toll of McCarthy. The Durham medium pacer was clobbered for two sixes and a boundary by Nabi. In the final over, the all-rounder took his game to an elevated plane with three sixes of the same bowler. It turned out to be a chastening experience for the Durham seamer as he ended up with figures of none for 69 in four overs. \nIf Nabi provided the finishing touches, then Mohammad Shahzad gave the launchpad for Afghanistan's massive total with a stroke-filled 43-ball 72. Shahzad now has aggregated 1,779 runs in T20Is, the fourth-most by any cricketer in the shortest format. \nWith this victory, Afghanistan have extended their winning streak in the shortest format to 11. The One-Day International series between the two sides will commence on March 15 in Greater Noida. \nBrief scores: Afghanistan 233/8 in 20 overs (Mohammad Nabi 89, Mohammad Shahzad 72; Kevin O'Brien 4-45) beat Ireland 205 in 19.2 overs (Gary Wilson 59; Rashid Khan 3-28) by 28 runs. © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T15:28:18.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
