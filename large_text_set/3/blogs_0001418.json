By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 3, 2017 1:05 PM Commando 2 Review: Vidyut Jamwal steals the show with his action sequences. (Source: IE image) \nIf anyone doubted that Vidyut Jammwal is the best action hero of his generation in Bollywood , the actor has cleared it with his breathtaking performance in his latest release Commando 2. The second instalment of Commando franchise, The Black Money Trail is full of action, thrilling stunts and in the middle of all the high-paced drama is Captain Karanvir Singh portrayed by Vidyut who steals the show with his action sequences. Even though he hardly has any expressions on his face, his stunts make up for that and soon, there will be comparisons with Hollywood legend Arnold Schwarzenegger. \nComing to the movie, this time the plot revolves around ending corruption in India by fighting against black money. Captain Karanvir Singh is on a mission to end money laundering in India and is accompanied by Freddy Daruwala and beautiful Adah Sharma who disappoint when it comes to portraying their roles. While Freddy carries the same expression on his face throughout, Adah fails to get her Hyderabadi accent right. \nWatch the trailer of Commando 2: \nEven talented actors like Adil Hussain and Esha Gupta have been wasted due to poor dialogues and a typical Bollywood story. The right has tried to play safe and has used the same old formula of giving a twist right before the interval. However, makers do deserve a pat on their back for getting the timing of the movie right. They have released it after PM Narendra Modi ’s demonetisation wave when there is a strong buzz around black money in India. \nThe film is directed by Deven Bhojani which is hard to believe. He is the same actor who made us laugh in movies like ‘Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar’ and ‘Chala Mussaddi Office Office’ and is also remembered for his role in the TV show ‘Ba Bahoo aur Baby’. Strangely, he chose an action movie to make his directorial debut and the mismatch reflects in the pace of the film. We have seen better action movies in Bollywood so if you are planning to watch Commando 2, do not expect anything else than Vidyut Jammwal’s magic. \nRating: 2 + 0.5 (for Vidyut) = 2.5/5 Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T09:39:19.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
