Chidi Duru \nMeanwhile, the prosecution served on the accused person’s a written counter affidavit to the earlier preliminary objection filed by Duru, while apologising orally for the services. \nDuru through his counsel, Abdul Mohammed informed the court that he was ready to move his preliminary objection and sought the leave of the court to address it on point of law given that the prosecution counsel had just served him in the open court his reply to our preliminary objection. The presiding judge subsequently granted the prayer which led to the adoption of the preliminary objection and the relevant affidavit in support. \nThe preliminary objection was hinged on the grounds that the charge was an abuse of court process, which is against the subsisting judgements of court, which constitute an affront to a valid restraining order of court. \nIn his response, the counsel who represented the EFCC, Sylvanus Tahir opposed the preliminary objection and stated that the judgements of the court that was relied on by the accused were based on a civil suit and therefore have no bearing to the current charge. He further urged the court to disregard the judgements. \nAfter hearing both arguments, the court reserved ruling till a later date which he said would be communicated to all parties involved.
