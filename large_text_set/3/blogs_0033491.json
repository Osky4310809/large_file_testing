If we can tackle the rural-urban migration by resolving issues of welfares, infrastructure and amenities we would have been able to tackle the problem of youths leaving the country for greener pasture under worst inhuman treatment. \nMeanwhile, the commissioner also visited the Internally Displaced Persons at their Camp Uhuogua, Ovia North East   the state, and assured that the Federal Government will improve the living standard of the people at the camp, adding “the president is with you and has not forgotten you people permanently. You should be good citizens of this country. Pray for the government that is fighting the insurgency. \n“I have come to see for myself that this IDP camp is real. I want you to be good children, read your books so that you can be great leaders tomorrow,” she stated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:39:55.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
