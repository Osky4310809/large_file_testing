Some areas could pick up a half-foot or more of snow in a short amount of time.\nThe snow will make for a difficult commute and will likely trigger significant flight delays Thursday in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia.\n(MORE: Winter Storm Central | How Winter Storms Are Named ) \nWinter storm warnings have now been posted by the National Weather Service for all of southern New England, southward into eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and parts of northern Delaware and northern Maryland. This includes the Boston, Providence, Hartford, New York City and Philadelphia.\nWinter storm watches extend into southern New Hampshire and coastal Maine and south into parts of northern Maryland north of Baltimore and Washington D.C., as well as parts of eastern West Virginia.\nWinter Weather Alerts, Credit: TWC The setup for this snow event features a pattern seen frequently in past winters, but not so much this winter.\nA sharp southward plunge of the polar jet stream in the East will spawn an area of low pressure off the Eastern seaboard by Thursday.\nEast Coast Setup Wednesday Night into Thursday, Credit: TWC With some cold air in place behind departing Winter Storm Maya , Niko should wrap moisture into sufficient cold air to wring out snow, heavy at times, near the Interstate 95 corridor.\nCheck out some of the worst snowstorms \n\nAs virtually always is the case, there are uncertainties on the exact track and forward speed of Niko. The latest forecast guidance is suggesting a track favorable for widespread accumulating snow, with the heaviest amounts from eastern Pennsylvania and the New York City Tri-State area into southern New England.\n(MORE: It's Peak Time for Northeast Snowstorms ) \nHere's the timeline and how much snow could fall.\nWednesday Night \nSnow spreads from the Ohio Valley and Appalachians into the Northeast.\nThe line separating rain from snow is still uncertain, making the forecast for the transition from rain to snow difficult from far southeast Pennsylvania to Maryland, the Delmarva Peninsula and northern Virginia.\nAt least some snow is most likely overnight north of Interstate 95, from north of Philadelphia to southern New England, including the New York City Tri-State area.\nWednesday Night's Forecast, Credit: TWC Thursday \nSnow may linger along the mid-Atlantic coast at least through the morning.\nFarther north, snow could be heavy at times from eastern Pennsylvania and the New York City Tri-State area into New England.\nGusty winds will also be on the increase across parts of the Northeast.\nThursday's Forecast, Credit: TWC How Much Snow? \nIn general, moderate to locally heavy accumulations of a half-foot or more are possible from eastern Pennsylvania and the New York City Tri-State area into New England.\nLocally higher snowfall rates could lead to greater amounts in some areas, particularly in southern New England, where up to a foot of snow is not out of the question.\nLighter amounts are forecast farther south into the mid-Atlantic region, though some higher terrain locations in the central Appalachians could also see higher totals.\nThe snow will lead to a tricky Thursday morning commute for at least part of the Boston-New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington D.C. corridor. Flight delays are likely.\nThe Thursday evening commute may be challenging in southeastern New England, including the Boston and Providence metro areas.\nSome blowing and drifting snow is possible Thursday in southeastern New England if the offshore low strengthens appreciably. \nSee winter weather from this season ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T15:10:42.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
