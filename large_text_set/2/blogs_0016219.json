There wasn’t much drama. Nothing was set on fire. And no lives were lost. It was a cordial discussion between two people with opposing views. HBO host Bill Maher invited Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, where the discussion was mostly rooted in both men’s support for free speech rights. Maher also said that he cared about the \"environment and living\" as well, taking a swipe at the conservative movement’s aversion to supporting policies to combat climate change. \nThe comedian brought up that both of them were run out of the Berkley campus, albeit the reaction to Yiannopoulos led to violet protests, $100,000 in property, and an FBI investigation into the matter. Milo later noted that Bill literally is the only good liberal left that respects free speech rights and discusses Islamic extremism honestly. \nMilo noted how the Democratic Party and the liberal movement has gone insane, Lena Dunham is the face of the party—which he notes will only lead to that party getting less votes (one could hope) in future elections. \n“Let’s not pick on fellow HBO stars,” said Maher. \nYet, another area they found agreement was comedy and humor, which has become a victim of the political correctness police. Milo noted that this form of progressivism is wholly authoritarian, hence they must more or less silence humor because it’s unpredictable. They hate that. Maher agreed. \n“And also because when people laugh, they know it’s true,” he said. \nAs we wrote previously, The Intercept’s Jeremy Scahill was booked for Friday’s episode of Real Time, but backed out when he found out Milo was a guest. Yiannopoulos aptly noted that when you don’t show up, you lose the debate—which drew applause from the audience. Maher had issued a statement defending his booking of Milo, noting that these anti-free speech antics is one the reasons why liberals will keep losing elections. \n“And also stop taking the bait, liberals,” said Maher. “The fact that they all freaked out about this little impish British fag, you fucking schoolgirls. You schoolgirls.” Of course, Milo relished this, agreeing with the HBO host with chuckles of laughter.“It’s so ridiculous,” he replied. \nYet, Maher and Milo disagreed about the Black Lives Matter movement, Twitter trolls, and other comedians, namely Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer, but closed his interview by saying that Mio should get off the Trump train. \n“For a guy who loves free speech, you picked a weird boyfriend, my friend,” said Maher. Milo tried to defend the president, but they were out of time. \nDuring Overtime, which airs online after the show, comedian Larry Wilmore, who was a panel guest, took the bait, telling Milo to “go fuck himself” over his opinion about Leslie Jones, the star of the disastrous Ghostbusters remake, and for calling him, along with former intelligence operative Malcolm Nance, another guest—awful and stupid. Former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA) was the conservative guest for the show’s panel, but more or less opted to let Milo, Bill and Larry go at it. \nThe question that got caused the tension centered on the Breitbart editor going after a transgendered person at a college, who he says fought for the right to use the women’s locker room after this person had left the school. \n“I don’t have a problem with it [a biologically born male thinking he’s female], but I think women and girls should be protected from having people—men who are confused about their sexual identities in their bathrooms,” said Milo. \n“That’s not unreasonable,” replied Maher. \nSo, at the beginning of the show, where Milo and Maher talked about liberals taking the bait, Larry Wilmore took the bait.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:09:42.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
