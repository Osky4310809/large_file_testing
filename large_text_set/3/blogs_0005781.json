It is difficult for me to judge [the level of the protests]. I [have] worked very hard for 20 years to make the fans happy.” \nHe also insisted that he had not told his players whether he had decided to extend his contract at the Emirates club.

Everybody else should be available.” \nWenger said he has not seen reports suggesting that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain wants to leave Arsenal in the summer. \nHe said the player “had been given his chance” at the club. “Personally, I rate him highly and I think I showed that in the way I kept faith in him, even when he was injured.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T11:58:37.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
