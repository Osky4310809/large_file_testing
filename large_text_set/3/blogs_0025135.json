Han will also “meet Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo),” according to the Hollywood Reporter , and “will be seen finding his ship, the Millennium Falcon.”\nThere’s also this interesting tidbit :\n\nHan Solo movie will follow him from age 18 through 24 and show him finding the Falcon, meeting Chewbacca, and getting his name, Iger says\n— Ben Fritz (@benfritz) March 23, 2017 \n\nThat last item seems to imply Han Solo isn’t his real name, which, obviously ; it’s as fake sounding as Jan Brady looking around the room and saying her boyfriend’s name is “George Glass.” But that’s not something that’s canonically been brought up before. We know that Han has occasionally gone by Vykk Draygo, Zack Kluggerhorn, and Master Marksman, but finding out his “real” name is an alias is an interesting wrinkle. Maybe “Han Solo” is actually Salacious D. Crumb, but he figured that would be too confusing for everyone.\nWe’ll find out on May 25, 2018.\n(Via the Hollywood Reporter )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:18:27.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
