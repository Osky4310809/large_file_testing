YOU. KIDDING. ME??! pic.twitter.com/qmvENf8xVC \n— Philadelphia 76ers (@Sixers) January 4, 2017 \n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers and Minnesota Timberwolves entered Tuesday night with a combined record that sat 28 games under .500 for the season. After 48 hectic and entertaining minutes, the two teams played what was the best game of the evening, and it ended with a Robert Covington buzzer-beater to send the Philadelphia crowd home in a joyous state.\nBefore Dario Saric and Covington connected on the game winner, Minnesota point guard Ricky Rubio knotted the game at 91-91 with a highly unlikely triple from a 27 percent three-point shooter. \n\nNot to be outdone, Sixers head coach Brett Brown drew up a beautiful play that featured Joel Embiid effectively screening off his former teammate in Andrew Wiggins to create space and the baseline angle also featured Embiid with an epic celebration after the fact. \n\n\nCovington, who has struggled with his shot all season to the tune of less than 40 percent from the floor and less than 30 percent from three, desperately needed this type of play for a confidence boost. In fact, it appears that everyone who uses “trust the process” as a life mantra took great pleasure in the end result. \nDario to Covington for the win with TJ slapping Brett Brown in the chest and Embiid falling down for no reason THE PROCESS IS ALIVE AND WELL\n— Michael Levin (@Michael_Levin) January 4, 2017 \n\nOf course, there is a winner and a loser to every game, and the now 11-24 Timberwolves did not share the same level of excitement. \n\n— Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) January 4, 2017 \n\nRobert Covington has been a wildly underrated NBA player for a few years, based largely on the anonymity that comes with playing on the league’s worst team. On this night, he gets to be the hero and NBA diehards were treated to a gem.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T05:59:52.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
