Brands have been busy reloading and expanding their SUV offerings, as worldwide consumer preference towards the high-riding machines shows no sign of abating. \nKia has one more crossover up its sleeve, and it will be revealed this year. The Korean brand, in an earnings presentation today, said that it plans to launch a small SUV in South Korea this year. The “crossover utility vehicle” will be based on the company’s current Pride sedan, which is the name of the Rio sedan it its home market, Reuters reported. \nNo further elaboration was made on the statement. Kia already has a B-segment SUV in its ranks. Called the Niro, it made its debut at the Chicago Auto Show early last year and is a dedicated hybrid model, Kia’s first. The Niro Hybrid was also rolled out in Europe last year, and was recently launched at the Singapore Motor Show for the city state. It shares a hybrid system with the Hyundai Ioniq that was recently launched here. \nKia also said that it planned to introduce a small SUV in Europe this year, without elaborating. Could it be a raised Rio hatch (fourth-gen launched late last year , and coming to Malaysia later this year) or something more funky to differentiate itself from the Niro and take on the Nissan Juke ? Your guess is as good as ours. \nGALLERY: Kia Niro Hybrid", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T15:13:38.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
