And if you crack open a cookbook or browse a few food blogs, that’s mostly what you’ll see. But for people who don’t already have experience in the kitchen, this is wildly inefficient. How to Become a Great Cook Without Being a Chef How to Become a Great Cook Without Being a Chef How to Become a Great Cook Without Being a Chef I have a confession to make: I don't love to cook.

You have to decide on the recipe, stop at the store on your way home from work, pick out all the ingredients you need (because that great-looking recipe always has a few secret, fancy ingredients you don’t have at home), then drive home and finally cook it. \nSure, meal-kit services like Blue Apron and Hello Fresh can ease some of that pressure. But, as Tom Philpott at Mother Jones points out , this still keeps you on the “one-dinner-at-a-time treadmill.” This time consuming process turns a lot of would-be cooks off, sending them straight for the take-out menus.

Not only do you save time and money doing this, you make cooking a habit and get better at it through repetition. After all, if you only do something once, you’re not really learning it. \nThen, once you’ve got a good cooking system down, you can start branching out and experimenting. When you find something you really like, you find a way to incorporate it into your system instead of letting the new dish disrupt it. With a systematic approach to home cooking, take-out can be saved for those fancy dishes you haven’t incorporated yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T00:22:25.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
