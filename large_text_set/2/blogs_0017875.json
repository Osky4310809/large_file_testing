Neymar \nIt claims it received less money than it was entitled to when Neymar joined Barca from Santos for £49 million in 2013. \nSantos FC, Neymar’s mother and a company run by the 25-year-old footballer’s parents will also face charges. \n“Santos FC, FC Barcelona, Neymar, his mother Nadine Goncalves and N&N, the family company, have lost their appeals to have charges of fraud and corruption dropped,” the Spanish High Court said in a statement on Monday. \nNAN reports that they cannot appeal against the court’s decision. \nProsecutors are seeking a two-year prison sentence and a fine of nearly £8 million for Neymar. \nHowever, even if the Brazil international were found guilty he would be unlikely to go to jail. \nUnder the Spanish legal system, prison terms of under two years are typically suspended. \nProsecutors are also seeking a fine of about £7.2 million for FC Barcelona and £5.6 million for Santos. \nBarca thought they had brought the affair to a close when a judge archived the case in June. \nBut Spain’s public prosecutor successfully overturned the ruling in September, allowing the case to proceed. \nNeymar’s FC Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi was sentenced to 21 months in prison for tax fraud in July of last year. \nHe has since appealed against the sentence.(NAN) adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:43:09.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
