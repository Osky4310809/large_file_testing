For Halloween , he transformed Nellee into Wonder Woman, and for Valentine's Day, this dedicated dad created an equally magical surprise.\nIn honor of Nellee's current obsession with Beauty and the Beast and in anticipation of the upcoming movie, Josh decided to turn her into Belle â€” complete with a jaw-dropping yellow gown. Josh knows that Nellee's favorite scene from the movie is when the Beast comes out and they fall in love, so he photographed real castles during a trip to Europe to use as the background for this love-filled photo shoot.\nDesigner Ella Dynae donated three replica dresses for the little princess, and when she first saw her gowns, Josh said that his daughter's reaction was priceless. \"She kept jumping up and down and smiling at me. She's only 3 years old so she couldn't express herself verbally as much as she would like but I understood how happy she was,\" Josh told POPSUGAR Moms. \"It was like going to Disneyland or something.\"\nAfter she changed into her enchanting costumes, the pair took photos in a studio, re-creating some of the child's favorite moments from the movie, including a father-daughter dance to \"Tale as Old as Time.\" \"Acting out some of the scenes was the most precious moment for me,\" Josh said. \"She was so happy to dance with me and I got a little emotional.\"\nAfter the memorable day together, Josh got to work photoshopping the images. On Valentine's Day morning, he surprised Nellee with a stunning portrait that he felt captured their love to show his little girl just how special she is to him. \"It's important for me to give her things like this first to remember the relationship we have and second because it's not really about the final gift,\" Josh said. \"It's about spending time with her doing something we both love. She loves acting and I love photographing her in these fun scenes.\"\nRelated:\nYou'll Be Blown Away by This Beautiful Father/Daughter Firefighter-Themed Photo Shoot\nA Dad's Job Is To Teach His Daughter How A Lady Should Be Treated\nThis Is Probably the Cutest Dad-Daughter Pep Talk That You'll Ever See\nPrevious Next", "external_links": ["http://www.elladynae.com/"], "published": "2017-03-21T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:32:38.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
