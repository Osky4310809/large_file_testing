These elite athletes indeed deserve fairness and respect, and we hope you will be a leader on this issue as women continue to push for equality in athletics.” USA Hockey, women's team had a deal last week before it was voted down \nThe letter to USA Hockey was signed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del.), Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Sen. Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.). \nOn March 15, the women’s team has said it will boycott the world championships , which begin Friday in Plymouth, Mich. \nUSA Hockey’s 90-member board was expected to meet at 12 p.m. ET on Monday to vote on an agreement that would end the boycott. \nIn a statement made the day the players announced the boycott, team captain Meghan Duggan said the players are seeking “a living wage from USA Hockey.” \nCurrently, they receive $6,000 every four years from USA Hockey. The men’s team makes the same amount, but CNN Money reported that USA Hockey covers transportation for guests, and those guests are allowed to stay at the players' hotel for IIHF events --- like the world championships --- and receive meals and game tickets. \nPlayers on the women’s team stated that they are not allowed to bring guests and are forced to share rooms with teammates. \nThe men also travel to games in business class, while the women fly coach. \nThat inequity was highlighted in the letter from the Senators, as they wrote, “We are disturbed by reports from the U.S. Women's National Hockey Team suggesting that USA Hockey is not providing 'equitable support' to female athletes. While USA Hockey provides its male athletes with a 'seemingly endless' supply of hockey equipment, for example, female players are often expected to 'buy their own.' This 'inequitable support for equipment, staff, meals, travel expenses, transportation, and publicity' is apparent at younger levels of the sport as well: while USA Hockey spends $3.5 million to support male youth athletes in its National Team Development Program, there is no parallel development program for women.” \nUSA Hockey president Jim Smith said earlier this month that, “USA Hockey’s role is not to employ athletes and we will not do so.” \nWithout an agreement in place, USA Hockey spent last week reaching out to replacement players. Dozens of them, including high school players, have said on social media that they would not play. \nUSA Hockey has inquired about players on NCAA Division III women’s hockey teams, adult league teams and Under-16 teams. \nUSA TODAY Sports reported on Sunday that the use of replacement players at the World Championship would “trigger” American NHL players to boycott their World Championship in May. 289 CONNECT 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:51:24.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
