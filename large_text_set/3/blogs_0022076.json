(Photo: Getty Images) More One supermodel’s before-and-after photos are sending a powerful message about body perfection : “Don’t be fooled by what you see on social media or in magazines.” On Tuesday, Marciel Hopkins , a plus-size model and former Miss South Africa finalist, posted two Instagram photos of herself wearing a white bra and underwear set. In one, she sits hunched over while running her hand through her long brown hair. In the other, she’s carefully posed to show off her chiseled stomach. “Let’s talk about angles and poses,” Hopkins wrote to her 40,000 followers. “Different poses end up giving different results. These 2 pictures were taken 5 minutes apart from each other, although the one shows a flat stomach and the other one shows my tummy flab. Same body, same day, different position.” Hopkins added, “Don’t be fooled by what you see on social media or in magazines. We are definitely not sitting or standing in the flattering poses that we see on Instagram or in glamour magazines all the time (that will be a workout in itself).” She also wrote, “We are human. We take our bras off when we get home and we wear a T-shirt on the days we are bloated.” She reminded fans that celebrities post only the most carefully curated selfies. Of the 8,000 comments posted in response, many told the model that she was “beautiful” and encouraged her to “Keep pushing for change.” Lately, a slew of models, bloggers, and celebrities have been flocking to social media to share “transformation photos” — before-and-after shots taken mere moments apart to reveal how good lighting, practiced poses, and specific angles can result in drastically different images. The body-positive movement is occurring at a time when mainstream fashion is broadening its beauty ideals (think plus-size model Ashley Graham on the covers of Vogue and the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue), and celebrities are getting real about so-called body perfection. “We have nutritionists, we have dietitians, we have trainers, we have our own schedules, we have nannies,” Chrissy Teigen recently told Today . Even Kylie Jenner has confessed that she takes 500 selfies per day to achieve the perfect shot, and Kim Kardashian follows three golden rules: “You need good lighting, obviously. Always take your selfie from above, angling down. And know your own angles. ” In January, blogger Sara Puhto showed her 66,000 Instagram followers how different her body could look with a strategic pose. She wrote, “I wanted to share this because I know how it feels to go through Instagram and see photos of people looking amazing on the beach — which are usually planned and not candid, that’s why they look so good.” In November, Puhto sent a similar message by sharing two photos of herself — in one shot, she stood straight, while in the other she was in the “booty pop position” to reveal how curvy her bottom could appear. Fitness blogger Anna Victoria posted two photos of herself in January wearing the same bikini — one shot showed her sculpted abs, the other her natural stomach folds. Her caption: “Me 1% of the time vs. 99% of the time.” In an effort to tell her followers that “not everything you see on the Internet is 100% truthful,” Australian blogger Beck Lomas shared a shockingly different split screen of herself wearing shorts and a bra top. “This transformation didn’t take months of hard work, sweat and dedication,” she wrote in October. “It took me two minutes, a quick flex of the core, a more attractive stance, and a nice filter.” And in February, fitness blogger Madalin Giorgetta shared her “30-second transformation” in two photos that portrayed her at vastly different-appearing weights. “I don’t look like either in real life,” she wrote. “In real life I’m not flexing like on the right and I’m not pushing my hips forwards like in the left.” Read more from Yahoo Style + Beauty:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:18:47.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
