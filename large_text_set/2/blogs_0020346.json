That's for both the PSN and Xbox Live -- you'll be able to grab it without the requirement of a season pass, or even owning FFXV proper.\nEven if you have no interest in playing the newly minted brodown JRPG, King's Tale  is self-contained enough, and has an understandable degree of beat 'em up charm to appeal to anyone. Once March 1 hits, go download it for a rainy afternoon.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:11:09.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
