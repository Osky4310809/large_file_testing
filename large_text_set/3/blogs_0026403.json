This adorable video reveals that the little dog isn’t shy about picking out a toy, even if it happens to be 10 times her size! \n“Going shopping for a toy with Lucy is something we do quite often. We always let her pick out the toy she wants… she actually will get up on the lower shelf (it’s one that she can reach easily) and she will sniff and search for what she thinks is the perfect toy,” says her humans. \n“She will sniff several before she makes her decision. As soon as she finds what she thinks is the perfect toy, she latches onto it and is ready to leave. We let her take it to the register counter and she really tries to be patient while the clerk is ringing up her toy.” \n“She watches contently and as soon as her Papa hands down the toy to her she grabs it and is ready for the front door! She will strut out that door like she is on a mission and heads straight for the car.” \nThey add, “Lucy is a very unique little dog and is totally oblivious to her size. She thinks she is just as big as any of the big dogs and she will let them know it.” \nShare this cute dog with your family and friends. \nIf you enjoyed this video, you’ll love this one of a dog who learns the pet store is closed .
