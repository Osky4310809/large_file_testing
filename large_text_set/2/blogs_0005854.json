OK? \n2. “kk” is never OK, but “K” is. \n3. Save the bars for your raps and text her in paragraphs. Sponsored \nWhat do you think of these rules? I will tell you how I feel, since I don’t care either way if Nicki Minaj blocks me on her phone or whatever other device she’s holding: I hate them! I don’t think anyone should impose communication rules on anyone else, and as someone whose trade is rooted in the English language, I would expect Nicki Minaj to respect the choices other people make in the name of self-expression. \nHere Nicki reminds me of guys I’ve seen on Grindr and Scruff whose profiles dictate elaborate, frankly arbitrary rules for how and now not to approach them: Don’t say “sup” or “hey”; Do say something interesting; Show your dick immediately; Don’t even let on that you have a dick, etc. etc. I don’t want to interact with someone who’s going to tell me how I need to behave in order to have my existence considered worth acknowledging. But this is (outside of the demonstrative purposes of this post) my silent rule, as I would much rather people come at me in the way they see fit and then judge them accordingly. I think you should let people do what they want because I believe that when someone shows you who they are not only should you believe them, but they’re doing you and your human-filtration system a favor. You only have so much time in your life for only so many people; anything that can signal someone is worth ignoring is a potential boon to your personal efficiency.

I had a boyfriend who hated the thumbs-up emoji. I don’t know why. He just...didn’t like it, so I couldn’t do it. Great, another thing to memorize about a person that I wasn’t going to end up being with forever. Another ex of mine practically threw a fit when he asked me if I wanted to do something, and I responded “sure.” Sure! It means yes ! It means, “I’m going to do what you want, per the proposition that is directly hanging over my affirmative response!” “No problem” sometimes becomes a problem when over-sensitive people want to scrutinize it. Nicki’s assertion that “K” is OK comes as a mild shock to me, as experience has beaten me into thinking that this is an entirely inappropriate way to share a brief display of affability and I should be ashamed for ever having even considered that one letter could do such a thing.
