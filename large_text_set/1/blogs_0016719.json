Women still are seeking a stronger voice in society as a new president is inaugurated who repeatedly demeaned women during his election campaign. The marchers’ mission statement pledges: “We will not rest until women have parity and equity at all levels of leadership in society.” \nThe 1913 women’s march, timed to get maximum publicity by coinciding with the inauguration, was not without controversy. \nAccording to the Library of Congress’ American Memory archives, crowds in town for the inauguration — mostly men — surged into the streets and made it difficult for the marchers to pass, forcing them to go single file at times. Women were jeered, tripped, shoved and spat upon, and police did little to assist them or quell the unrest. Some 100 marchers were taken to the hospital with injuries. \nThe participants included Helen Keller, the deaf and blind political activist and author. She was so unnerved by the disruptions that she was unable to speak later that day at Continental Hall. \nSecretary of War Henry Stimson authorized a troop of cavalry to help control the crowd, according to the archives. \nThe treatment of the women by the crowd and police led to congressional hearings and the ouster of the District of Columbia’s police chief. \n“If I had had a policeman’s billy, I would have got that crowd back,” one suffragist testified at the hearings, The Times reported. \nThe controversy ultimately worked to the women’s advantage, producing broad and sympathetic press coverage for their cause.
