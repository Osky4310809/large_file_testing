I know exactly where I put it,” Brady said as he called the security staff and team equipment managers to assist in the search.\nBackup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo told other players to look for the jersey, but the longer he searched, the more Brady seemed to grow concerned it had been stolen.\n“This is not good,” he said. “It was right here and now I don’t have it. Not good.”\nWhile walking out of the stadium, Brady was asked by USA TODAY Sports if he had managed to locate the jersey during his extensive search.\n“No,” he replied. “It is going to be on eBay soon, I guess.” \nHere’s Brady telling Pats owner Robert Kraft that someone stole his jersey. \nNFL: Hey can someone give Tom Brady his jersey back? #SB51 (via danhanzus) pic.twitter.com/QTPCrj4D5s #NFL \n— The Armchair QB (@ESPNHQ) February 6, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:23:55.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
