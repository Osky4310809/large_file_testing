Despite the clock showing that there were 0.4 seconds still left to play, the St. Bonaventure bench players and fans mobbed the court. \nBrutal way to lose.\nSt. Bonaventure assessed a technical for premature court storm. VCU would make the foul shot to force OT & win. pic.twitter.com/Eel1pc2bMq \n— Matt Schick (@ESPN_Schick) February 4, 2017 St. Bonaventure hit this three to go up 1 against VCU w .4 secs left on the clock.

Boyer (@wcboyer24) February 4, 2017 The officials assessed St. Bonaventure a technical foul for the players leaving the bench and the students coming onto the court. The result was one foul shot for VCU’s JeQuan Lewis, who calmly sank it to send the game into overtime. \nVCU outscored the stunned Bonnies by six in the extra frame, securing a huge 83-77 victory that allowed it to keep pace with Dayton at the top of the A-10.
