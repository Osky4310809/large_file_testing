I am delighted to work with these guys and the way they try to do the things. \n\"These are new things for everybody. Sometimes it is quicker, sometimes you need more time. \n\"In my career as a manger I never expect what is going to happen. I am training and playing and training and playing, after seeing the good things and bad things to getting better. \n\"We are not even in January. There are a lot of games to play. You have to be patient and keep going.\" \nBurnley are next up for City in the Premier League on Monday – the latest test for a defence that has come in for its share of scrutiny. \nGuardiola rejected the notion that goalkeeper Claudio Bravo was to blame when Wijnaldum derailed a promising start for the visitors at Anfield and praised aspects of defensive play from his team that were ultimately in vain. \n\"We were a lot of people [defenders] there but it is a good cross, a good header,\" he said. \n\"I am not a guy to come here to personalise, to say we lost for this reason. In one game many, many things happen. \n\"How we reacted after 1-0… I didn't see people not running and not playing with personality. We just missed a little bit in front for the last pass, the last individual action. \n\"It's a little bit part of our seasons. We control the games, we concede here at Anfield. I think it was the goal and after Bravo did not take another ball. \n\"We were quite stable behind. We controlled their start points of counter-attacks with [Sadio] Mane and the other ones. \n\"We did not let them run too much because they defend well and when they win the ball they are a top team running in behind.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:07:44.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
