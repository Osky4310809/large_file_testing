Of course, it would be a dream to play for one of these big clubs. \n“Hopefully if I continue doing well for Swansea and Iceland then in the near future, I can play in a big club. I am enjoying being one of the senior players, though. \n“We may be in a tough spot, but I am kind of enjoying the pressure of that. I am trying to make the most of that and help the team to get three points every week.” \nSwansea have moved clear of the relegation zone after poor spells under both Francesco Guidolin and Bob Bradley earlier in the season, and Sigurdsson is confident that his side can rediscover their good form to beat the drop. \nCosta: Atleti missed their chance! \n“The results in the last couple of games haven’t been as good as we would have hoped, losing two very important matches. There’s still a long way to go,\" he said. \n“If you look at the bigger picture, with where we were at Christmas and where we are at the moment, we have made a big step towards safety but, of course, it's a really tough season with a lot more football to be played. \n“Hopefully we can continue the good work that we have been doing over the last six or seven weeks and we stay up. Clement has been fantastic, you can tell that there’s a reason why he has been at these big clubs that he has been at. \n\"He is very organised. His training sessions are fantastic. He is very positive and he is very good man-to-man with the players. The players have confidence in him and all together it feels like a good combination.” \nSigurdsson has been a key player for Swansea this season and he has so far recorded nine goals and 10 assists in 31 games.
