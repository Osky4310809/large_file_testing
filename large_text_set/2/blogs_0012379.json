Very un-American!\nCrimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?\nTrump’s chief campaign strategist, Paul Manafort, vehemently denies speaking with Russian Intelligence Officials.  \"That is 100% not true, at least as far as me,\" he said. \"I cannot believe that they are including me in anything like that. I have not been involved in any of these activities.\"\nManafort has come under scrutiny due to his close ties to the Yanukovitch government in Ukraine, widely viewed as a very pro-Russia regime.  \n\"I don't remember talking to any Russian officials, ever. Certainly during the time we're talking about,\" Manafort reiterated. “I have knowingly never talked to any intelligence official or anyone in Russia regarding anything of what's under investigation,\" he added. \"I have never had any connection to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin or the Russian government before, during or after the campaign.\"\nDespite Manafort’s insistence and Trump’s latest tweet, there are widespread concerns that members of the Trump campaign team may have coordinated with Russian Intelligence to leak documents and spread fake news in the lead-up to the election.  \n\"If that were the case, then that would escalate things,\" one official briefed on the investigation said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:00:40.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
