[1] Wizards and witches in these countries generally chose to homeschool their children instead. [1] Correspondence courses were also sometimes used as a cost-effective method of providing magical instruction to young witches and wizards in countries with very small or isolated wizarding populations. [1] Day student of Mahoutokoro in Japan riding to school on a giant storm petrel \nWizarding schools generally admitted students from whatever country in which they were based, but some served multiple nations or a broad geographical region, or at least were open to accepting international students on a selective basis. Castelobruxo , Ilvermorny and Uagadou accepted students from all over their respective continents, [2] [3] [4] whereas Hogwarts only accepted students from the United Kingdom and Ireland .

[2] [7] \nSome schools also enforced special restrictions with regard to the admission of students. The Durmstrang Institute , for example, did not accept Muggle-born witches and wizards. [8] \nThe Educational Office of the International Confederation of Wizards was responsible for cataloguing and overseeing wizarding schools around the world, namely the eleven oldest, most respected ones. [1] Smaller wizarding schools existed, but these were often short-lived and poorly-regulated, as most were not registered with the respective Ministry of Magic of the country in which they operated. [1] The quality of magical education on offer at these smaller, unregistered institutions was thus questionable.
