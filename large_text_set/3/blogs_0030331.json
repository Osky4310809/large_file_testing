Scrubs, chemical peels, and masks are regular steps in our routine, but those pesky spots remain. The only treatment that ever helps is the use of a pore strip.\nThough we DIY this remedy frequently, the brilliant beauty Huda Kattan found a clever hack to re-creating these blackhead blasters with just one product: school glue. It may sound strange, but she demonstrates how effective this technique is in this quick Instagram video. She slicks the sticky stuff over her nose and waits for it to dry, then carefully peels it off. As the glue lifts away from her skin, it adheres to each blackhead and pulls it out, declogging every pore.\nWatch and prepare to be amazed, then view Huda's glue tutorial on her YouTube channel .", "external_links": ["https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/12751248_222062381477919_865930806_n.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewuaN4Yy09A", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BCbAkVgK6cf/"], "published": "2017-03-28T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:30:09.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
