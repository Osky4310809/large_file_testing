In a sense, this isn’t absurd at all, seeing as a handful of TV personalities are running the country. Sadly, the most unbelievable part of this story is that Trump would follow through on whatever hints or promises he made to Napolitano behind closed doors.\nNapolitano reportedly spoke excitedly and often about this prospect to his very patient friends, none of whom appear to have believed him at any point. Then one of them talked to Poitico about it. “He said, ‘Trump said I’m on the list,’” a source told Politico. “He’s been saying that since the transition.” The source said he and other friends warned Napolitano not to take the president at his word.\nAdvertisement \n\nEven once Trump released a list of potential Scalia replacements—a list that in no way contained Napolitano’s name—then nominated Tenth Circuit judge Neil Gorsuch, this brazen man went around claiming he is a “sleeper candidate.” Napolitano bragged that he submitted academic papers and a resume to Trump aides, as if anyone in the White House still reads.\nA source close to the White House told Politico , “The president already has a list of highly qualified contenders for future SCOTUS opens, and Judge Napolitano is not on it,” a sentence I never knew I wanted to hear so badly until this very day.\nOn Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that Fox News had suspended Napolitano’s on-air appearances over another baseless claim—one Trump actually repeated publicly—that British intelligence officials spied on Trump at the behest of President Barack Obama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:38:15.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
