No weapons were fired, as the police told the rappers “Get on the ground, get the (expletive) on the ground.” \nIn a separate interview with NewsFix, Tru explained that the scene was only supposed to take 10 seconds, but that they lost a camera and got slowed down trying to find it. \nIt sounds as though Tru learned his lesson, speaking to the cops through the Click2 interview, he said, “Thank y’all for not shooting me or my bros. Next time we promise we’ll let y’all know if we gon’ do something like that. It was a bad idea with a good reason.” \nWatch the local news report on the incident below.
