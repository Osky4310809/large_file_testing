I couldn't find a pack of 24 mint-choccolate cookies at our grocery store and instead bought a 15 cookie pack and just skipped putting the cookies on the top. I also substituted 2 cups of whipped cream for the whipped topping and it was divine!!! We will be making this again!\" MY REVIEW obsessedwithfood User ID: 3724663 124674 Reviewed May. 28, 2011 \n\"This was very easy to make and it tastes delicious! I only used an 8 oz container of whipped topping and I still couldn't fit the whole filling into the crust. I also used Girl Scout thin mint cookies. Would definitely make this again.\" MY REVIEW millsma User ID: 1315301 46613 Reviewed Aug. 14, 2010 \n\" quick to make and very tasty.
