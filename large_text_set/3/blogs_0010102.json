His devastating pace terrorised Otamendi all evening and he lost the Argentine defender for Monaco's second goal, which he coolly placed into the top corner beyond goalkeeper Willy Caballero. \nThe 18-year-old is in blistering form -- scoring eight goals from his last seven appearances, including six in his last three matches at the Stade Louis II. City's defence has improved markedly in the last two months -- keeping seven clean sheets in their last 10 games -- and Otamendi must maintain that improvement if he is to keep Mbappe quiet. \nRadamel Falcao vs. John Stones \nWith the exception of Monaco fans, no one will be watching out for Falcao's injury report with more interest than City defender Stones. The Ligue 1 leaders are hoping the striker will be fit after picking up a hip injury late in Monaco's 2-1 victory over Bordeaux on Saturday. \nFalcao was devastating in the first leg -- scoring twice and showing exactly what the Premier League had missed in his two misfiring season-long loans at Manchester United and Chelsea. \nHis first was a brilliant diving header as he drifted away from Stones at the back post to find a couple of yards of space. His second was even better as he outmuscled Stones from a long ball, cut inside the England defender before lifting a delicious chip over Caballero. \nThe only blot on Falcao's night was a nervy penalty -- comfortably saved by Caballero, which cost him a hat trick. If he is passed fit, he will be keen to make amends. \nJemerson vs. Sergio Aguero \nMonaco's best defender, Kamil Glik, is suspended for the second leg putting even more pressure on a back four that was easily breached in the 5-3 defeat. \nAguero is in the middle of one of his hot streaks at the moment -- scoring six times in his last five games after regaining his place in City's starting XI following an injury to Gabriel Jesus. \nThe Argentina international scored twice in the first leg and seems in the mood to punish Monaco if they make the sort of individual errors that spoiled their night at the Etihad. Brazilian defender Jemerson, who was suspended for the first clash, is expected to replace Glik and will need to be switched on to deal with Aguero's threat. The FC panel preview Manchester City's leg two clash against Monaco in the UEFA Champions League. \nBernardo Silva vs. Yaya Toure \nSilva added to his growing reputation with an impressive performance in the first leg at the Etihad. He set up Falcao's equaliser in the first half and completed seven successful dribbles -- more than any other player on the pitch. \nOne stunning run saw him glide past challenges from David Silva and Leroy Sane, then nutmeg Toure before playing in Falcao, who didn't quite have the pace to latch on to his pass. \nToure has been in brilliant form recently and could be again play a pivotal role as a deep-lying midfielder just in front of the back-four. He will be required to break up Monaco's lightning quick breaks and needs to get to grips with Silva primarily if City are to avoid being overrun in midfield. \nDjibril Sidibe vs. Leroy Sane \nSane caused huge problems for Sidibe in the first leg -- constantly running at the French full-back until he appeared to run out of stamina in the closing stages. Sidibe wasn't the only Monaco player to buckle late on as City scored three times in the last 20 minutes, but he will need to improve if he is stop the Germany winger on Wednesday night. \nSane is full of confidence at the moment -- scoring three goals in his last five games and setting up Aguero's second in the FA Cup victory over Middlesbrough on Saturday to round off a brilliant individual performance when he terrorised full-back Antonio Barragan. \nJonathan is ESPN FC's Manchester City correspondent.
