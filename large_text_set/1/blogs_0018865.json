If confirmed, Johnson would replace Matthew Barzun, who was finance chair for President Obama’s 2012 election campaign.\nJohnson, 69, was national finance chairman for Trump rival Jeb Bush during the Republican primaries before backing Trump. After Johnson gave the Bush ­super PAC Right to Rise $500,000, in addition to maxing out to his campaign, Trump used him as Exhibit A when charging Bush was in the pocket of wealthy special interests.\nBut Johnson gave the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee, $100,000 in June 2016, after it was clear that Trump would be the nominee. Johnson also served as an adviser to the campaign.\nHe also was a top fundraiser for Republican presidential nominees Mitt Romney, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and George W. Bush.\nJohnson is a scion of the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical business, a philanthropist and since 2000 the owner of the Jets. The team has had some on-field success under his ownership, reaching the playoffs in six seasons.\nJohnson is expected to step back from the day-to-day operations of the Jets while serving as ambassador. That was the approach taken by the Pittsburgh Steelers when their longtime owner, Dan Rooney, served as ambassador to Ireland during the Obama administration.\nJohnson would take on a role that involves promoting U.S. businesses and interests at a time when Britain is disentangling itself from the European Union. Trump supported the Brexit decision and has said he wants a new U.S.-U.K. trade deal.\nHe also raised eyebrows in Britain by holding congratulatory phone calls with several other foreign leaders before speaking with British Prime Minister Theresa May, and by extending her an oddly casual invitation to the White House. “If you travel to the U.S. you should let me know,” Trump said, according to a leaked transcript of his call with May.\nState visits usually require months of detailed planning, and the first meeting of an American and British leader would typically be a lavish affair.\nThe U.S.-British alliance is fondly called “the special relationship” by both sides, as outgoing State Department spokesman John Kirby said upon learning of Johnson’s selection Thursday.\n“It’s a very deep, very long, very strong relationship, and therefore the individual who represents the United States in London also has a special place and special responsibilities,” Kirby said, without commenting on Johnson himself. “It is one of the most consequential ambassadorial posts.”\nKirby probably didn’t mean it literally, but that “special place” is lovely indeed: Winthrop House, the U.S. ambassador’s residence in London, is a magnificent mansion surrounded by acres of parkland that has, during Barzun’s time, included soccer goals for his young children.\nThe British ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, congratulated his counterpart on Twitter.\n“Congrats @WoodyJohnson4 on nomination as US Ambassador to the UK! Surely you can replicate the success of @NYJets in London 2015,” Darroch wrote.\nThe Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins in a game played at London’s Wembley Stadium that year.\nJohnson joins a few other Trump donors and advisers selected as ambassadors, including Gov. Terry Branstad (R-Iowa) as ambassador to China and bankruptcy lawyer and Trump friend David Friedman as ambassador to Israel.\nJulie Tate, Anu Narayanswamy and Mark Maske contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJIpXubme1M", "https://twitter.com/@agearan"], "published": "2017-01-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:25:29.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
