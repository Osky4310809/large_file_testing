he does it. \nThe Clarets’ 1-0 win against Southampton last weekend lifted them into the top half of the Premier League — despite being one of the favourites for the drop. 5 \nAnd boss Dyche — whose team face Arsenal at the Emirates today — says Wenger has been staggered by Burnley ’s success story. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Premier League gossip and transfers on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nHe said: “Arsene told me he couldn’t believe how we’d done it. \n“He was fascinated how this was achieved and how we worked with the players. \n“He was interested in the challenges we had to overcome and was asking me how we’ve managed to do it. \n“That shows the measure of the man. He isn’t just thinking about himself and his club, he’s saying, ‘Tell me about your world, Sean, and how you manage to do things on that budget’.” \nIt is often said a team reflects its manager, so it is small wonder that Burnley are a team of workhorses. Sean Dyche is impressed by the way Arsene Wenger takes an interest in the workings of clubs like Burnley Sean Dyche tells Justin Allen that Arsene Wenger is amazed by Burnley's success \nWhen Wenger took over at Arsenal , Dyche was enjoying his most memorable season at Chesterfield. \nThe no-nonsense defender was a key part of the third-tier Spireites team that reached the FA Cup semi-final. \nDyche scored from the spot to put Chesterfield into a 2-0 lead against Premier League club Middlesbrough but they were pegged back to 2-2 and went out 3-0 after a replay. \nIt was a season that saw Wenger guide Arsenal to third — and a year when Dyche, even though he was aged just 24, started thinking he might one day become a manager. \nHe said: “I never in my wildest dreams thought I might one day be taking Arsene Wenger on as a Premier League manager. 5 Dyche says when he was a player for Chesterfield he never even dreamed of bossing a Prem club against Arsenal \n“But even back then my pathway was beginning to lean towards management. I was starting to look at tactics and getting the best out of teams working under John Duncan.” \nDyche is from a family of grafters. His dad was a management consultant for British Steel, his mum was a machinist in a shoe factory. \nHis brother, Andrew, 50, works for Weetabix while Neil, 52, is a builder. \nBut Dyche , 45, revealed the core value that underpins his team was taught to him as a seven-year-old in Kettering. \nHe said: “I remember what my Sunday youth team manager used to say — a great fella called Jim Hoover. \n“Jim, who I still see sometimes, would say, ‘A great attitude is everything’. I’ve carried that throughout my life. \n“It’s important to have respect on and off the pitch. Getty Images 5 Dyche has helped turn men like much-wanted defender Michael Keane into major Prem stars \n“I was brought up with good standards. I try to do simple things, like being a good dad.” \nIndeed, he takes his role as a father so seriously that he warns his players against conning refs — so he never has to look son Max in the eyes and admit he endorses cheating. \nDyche — who also has a daughter called Alicia — is one of the main voices calling for bans for players caught on TV replays diving and is happy the FA are now considering it. \nHe said: “Cheating is cheating — whether you hit someone or dive. \n“I don’t want my son looking at me and saying, ‘Dad, your team are cheating’.” \nDyche is one of only FOUR English managers in the Premier League, along with Eddie Howe at Bournemouth, Crystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce, and Derby manager Paul Clement.

I’ll pass on bits I’ve learned if I think it can help. I don’t force them to take it on board. They’re mature enough to make their own choices. 5 Sean Dyche revealed all to Sun man Justin Allen about the respect shown by Arsene Wenger \n“If you can build a rapport, though, and be able to offer your views, it’s good for them, good for me, good for the club. \n“Get all those things right and you’re building a culture where that player can thrive. \n“Then, if you add tactics and the freedom of each player to use their qualities, you’re on to something. \n“For clubs like ours, it’s about building without the things people think you should have. \n“As much as we like the beauty of the game and big-name players, we’re not blessed with that but we’re blessed with a team that will give everything.” CHESTERFIELD DAYS \nWHEN Arsene Wenger first took over at Arsenal, Sean Dyche was enjoying his most memorable season at Chesterfield. \nThe then no-nonsense defender was a key part of the third-tier Spireites team that reached the FA Cup semi-final. \nDyche scored from the spot to put Chesterfield into a 2-0 lead against Premier League club Middlesbrough before they were pegged back to 2-2 and eventually went out 3-0 after a replay. \nIt was a season that saw Wenger guide Arsenal to third in his season – and a year when Dyche, even though he was aged just 24, started thinking he might one day become a manager. \nHe said: “ I never in my wildest dreams thought I might one day be taking Arsene Wenger on as a Premier League manager. \n“It’s incredible to think what he has achieved since 1996. \n“But even back then my pathway was beginning to lean towards management. I was starting to look at tactics and getting the best out of teams working under John Duncan. \n“We had a team that I thought was a group of ‘all rightness’ at that level at the time and yet he made that group a lot better than it was. \n“We then all got broken up into bits for a lot of money. \n“They had not moved a player for years for any serious money. People like myself Kevin Davis, Mark Williams, my goalkeeper coach now Billy Mercer, Tom Curtis and Paul Holland. \n“All of sudden this group deemed ‘all right’ in the third tier were considered really good players. \n“And I learned this was all because of the work John Duncan did with us – the tactics and players knowing their roles. \n“It got me fascinated and was the first time I started to think more than just a footballer. I was looking at training, recovery, getting ready for games. \n“I went on to take my B license at Millwall in 1999 and then my A license in 2005. \n“But it all started that season when Arsene Wenger first came to these shores and here we are today facing each other.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T03:22:46.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
