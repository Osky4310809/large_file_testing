Although the sign was not damaged, several letters were wrapped with tarps, which briefly changed the sign’s appearance to read “Hollyweed”.\nDetectives last week said they would not arrest the prankster on suspicion of misdemeanor trespassing, but would instead present their findings to the district attorney’s office.\nFernandez was expected to be released on his own recognizance. He is scheduled to appear in court on Feb. 15.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:43:46.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
