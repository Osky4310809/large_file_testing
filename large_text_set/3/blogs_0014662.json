The veteran PBA import hopped in and played one game with the Fuel Masters coming from the Taipei league. \nMcKay, however, could well bring a lot more on the table for Phoenix, being taller than Phelps at 6-foot-9 and younger at 24. Phelps, the Fuel Masters’ import in the Governors Cup, is a shade below 6-5.   \nThe Milwaukee, Wisconsin native made a reputation as a solid two-way player while playing first for Indian Hills CC then with Iowa State. \nHe was a two-time First Team NJCAA All American with Indian Hills (2012 and 2013) then made the All Big 12 Third Team and bagged the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year with Iowa State in 2015. \nHe ended his stint with the Iowa State Cyclones with good all-around averages of 11.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.0 blocks, 0.7 assist and 0.6 steal, underscoring his capability to score and defend. \nHe brought his stuff in Australia after being left undrafted in the last NBA Draft. \nAmundson, on the other hand, is a veteran who showed his wares in the NBA from 2006 to 2016, playing first for the Utah Jazz then with the Philadelphia 76ers, the Phoenix Suns, the Golden States Warriors, the Indiana Pacers, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Chicago Bulls, the New Orleans Pelicans, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Knicks. \nThe 6-foot-9 power forward out of UNLV has NBA career averages of 3.7 points and 3.6 rebounds. Among his career highlights was a 17-rebound performance last year against the San Antonio Spurs. \nTNT actually has two prospects as a replacement to Denzel Bowles. The other guy is still working on his release from the Puerto Rican league.
