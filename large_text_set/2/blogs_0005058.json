The voiceover actress has established herself as one of the ultimate fangirls with her fashion company, Her Universe. The fashion and lifestyle brand is a clothing and accessory go-to for fangirls of some of the biggest names in TV and comics, such as Star Wars , Doctor Who , and Marvel. \nAs one of the top fangirls, it seems only fitting that Eckstein’s Her Universe office is its own homage. As a self-professed fangirl of Alice and Wonderland , Eckstein decorated her office in the vein of the Disney classic film and Lewis Carroll novel. \nShe gave recently gave Disney a tour of the office: \nEckstein revealed that her idea for the themed office came from her own dining room at home in Florida. Eckstein said that she decorated her dining room as the Mad Hatter’s tea party , which she commonly used as her office in Florida. So, when it was time to redecorate the Her Universe office, Eckstein thought she’d bring her home office to work. \nJoin us NOW on www.youtube.com/disneystyle We are about to unveil my office!!! \nA photo posted by Ashley Eckstein (@heruniverse) on Feb 2, 2017 at 12:00pm PST \n“We were inspired by the Mad Hatter’s tea party, so we really looked at the tea party scene,” Eckstein noted, showing Disney Style details such as the door mouse and the cheshire cat, and even revealed that the muralist copied the Wonderland door according to her height. \nLooked who stopped by my new office to say Hi today?!? @alexalltimelow and @jackalltimelow They performed at our first Her Universe Fashion Show at SDCC so it's only fitting that they were some of my first tea party guests! #alltimelow \nA photo posted by Ashley Eckstein (@heruniverse) on Feb 2, 2017 at 6:55pm PST \n“I love [Disney artist] Mary Blair. So I was very inspired by Mary Blair and some of her paintings and so we painted a mural on the wall,” Eckstein revealed of the famed artist who was responsible for the concept art of many of Walt Disney’s early films, including Alice and Wonderland, Cinderella, and Peter Pan . \nWe’re obsessed with this office and think it may serve as some serious inspiration next time we’re in the mood to redecorate. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:04:15.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
