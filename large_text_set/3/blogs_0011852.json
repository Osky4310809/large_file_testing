They're identical down to the color - the only difference nowadays is the lack of the \"Lego\" brand stamp on each little nub. You won't get fancy pieces like the mini-figs or odd shapes, but if you're just looking to add a ton of basic block shapes, they're legit. \nYou spend pennies on the dollar for basic brick shapes, then if you really want to spend your full budget, spend the rest on official Lego sets that you want as that's where you'll find the fun shapes and custom pieces that you can't get anywhere else. \nAnd yeah, I understand that the off-brand blocks have a bad reputation from previous eras... They've upped their game though, or at least the ones that I got all had connections that were every bit as good as the originals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T06:54:44.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
