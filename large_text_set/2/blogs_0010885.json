Picture: Mark Evans \nHe managed to string some games together, but then broke his hand right before the finals wrestling former teammate Paul Vaughan at training. \n“Just as I started to feel a bit of momentum it seemed like something else crept up and halted me again,” Austin said. \n“But if last year is going to be the worst year of my career, it wasn’t all that bad. \n“We got to one win from the grand final, it was my first taste of finals footy.” media_camera Blake Austin celebrates scoring a try durig the semi-final against Penrith. \nLuckily, preparations for the upcoming season have gone a whole lot smoother and Austin is itching to get back out on the field and team up with halves partner Aidan Sezer. \n“I’ve been able to work a lot harder in the gym than I have the past couple of years,” Austin said. \n“My shoulders have sort of held me back in the past. \n“Last year I wasn’t able to do a lot of the training. But I’ve got all the running done too, so it’s been pretty pleasing. \n“Aidan and I have been able to get a lot more done together so it’s only going to benefit the team. \n“We’re both at a really good base level of fitness and we’re probably stronger than we were last year. \n“We understand that for the Raiders to take the next step, we both need to step up.” media_camera Raiders Blake Austin and Aidan Sezer at GIO Stadium in Canberra. Picture: Kym Smith \nWith a squad virtually the same as last season, many are tipping the Green Machine to power all the way to the title. \nAustin said the team were relishing the competition’s ‘heavyweight’ tag. \n“This will be the first time the most expectation the Raiders have headed into a season with for a while,” he said. \n“We’re going to have to deal with that, but we’re all pretty excited about giving it a good crack.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:18:42.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
