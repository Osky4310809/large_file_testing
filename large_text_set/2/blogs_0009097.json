She even earned some applause from the crowd at Studio 8H when she asserts that Trump “is doing too much,” and that it would be nice to go one day without a horrible CNN alert about the next terrible thing stemming from the hallways of the White House. \n  — which already saw the highly-anticipated return of Melissa McCarthy as press secretary Sean Spicer —   .
