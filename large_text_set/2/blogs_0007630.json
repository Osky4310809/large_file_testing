By Snehal Rajani | Updated: February 8, 2017 9:02 pm From Badrinath Ki Dulhania title song to Jolly LLB 2's Go Pagal: 5 Holi songs which will set you grooving \nVarun Dhawan a.k.a Badri is on a mission to find his Dulhani and therefore he has shared his biodata on his social media account. We all know that Varun is gearing up for his next project Badrinath Ki Dulhania for which the promotions are going on in full swing. The actor has shared his biodata on his Insta feed and he is expecting you to find him his Dulhania. “My bio data for marriage#badrinathkidulhania,” he captioned the pic. The biodata is something that will instantly crack you up. Towards the end, for the partner preference section, it also reads, “Jo humse compound interest ka formula na pooche”. Hahaha. Now this is hilarious! Remember how in the trailer Alia, his Dulhania asks him to tell the mathematical formula for simple interest and compound interest? This is in reference to that! So c’mon all you guys.. wouldn’t you want to help Badrinath find a suitable bride?

Needless to say, Alia and Varun make a wonderful pair and seeing them onscreen is an absolutely delight. Their chemistry looks superb so let’s hope the film has got something interesting in store for viewers. We saw them last in Student of The Year and Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania and we couldn’t get enough of them. Let’s hope that Badrinath Ki Dulhania leaves the same impression too!
