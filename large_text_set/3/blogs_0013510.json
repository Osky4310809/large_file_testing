Paul Pogba hobbled off injured in the Europa League win over FC Rostov (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) It hasn't been a season to remember for £89m Paul Pogba yet (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nAfter being outshone by Chelsea road-runner N'Golo Cante in the FA Cup here was the chance for Pogba to bite back at the critics who claim his fellow Frenchman is twice the player at way less than half the cost. \nThe game, though, didn't start well for Pogba. With less than 20 seconds on the clock the Frenchman tried one of his infuriating flicks, lost the ball and end up conceding a foul. \nAnd it didn't get any better. \nSome might say his shocker was par for the course for the hapless midfielder on recent evidence. But what followed was poor even by his falling standards. \nMis-placed passes and shots wildly off target suggest a player short on confidence, strange given his social media persona , changing hair-cuts and new dances.
