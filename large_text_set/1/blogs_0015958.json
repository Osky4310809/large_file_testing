Now, health officials are warning that the bacterial meningitis could have spread to hundreds of other cyclists who visited the studio. According to media reports, Sevin Philips, a therapist who lived in San Rafael and worked in San Francisco, died Saturday from meningococcal meningitis, one of the most common forms of the infection. He was 48. As many as 300 riders may have come in contact with Philips, ABC 7 reports . They’ve been notified by the manager at SoulCycle Marin, as well as the county’s Department of Health and Human Services. Bacterial meningitis is spread in a similar manner as a flu — through sneezing, coughing, and contact with some surfaces. But, as the CDC notes , because it’s caused by bacteria, not a virus, which is what spreads colds and flus, it’s not as contagious. Still, Dr. Matt Willis, the public health officer for Marin County, said the cyclers were contacted “out of an abundance of caution” and advised to go on a regimen of ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic. The people most at risk of contracting meningitis are those who were in direct contact with someone who was infected. “Close contact is usually defined as several hours of very close contact,” Willis told NBC Bay Area . “That’s one of the reasons why we often see just one case without seeing subsequent transmission.” Meningitis is an infection that causes inflammation in the brain or spinal cord, and in extreme cases, can kill within hours. Symptoms include fever, headache, and a stiff neck, and could be accompanied by sensitivity to light and confusion. Doctors advise that anyone who may have been in contact with someone with the infection start a prophylactic regimen of antibiotics as soon as possible. Vaccine schedules have also proven effective at preventing a meningitis infection, although the CDC notes that getting immunized isn’t an entirely fail-safe option. SoulCycle issued a statement Friday, saying it was “deeply saddened” by the loss of Philips. “While the rider did not contract the infection at our studio, we have nonetheless been in constant communication with the department of health, which has emphasized that there is no evidence for any health risk to our riders. “We’ve done a deep cleaning of our studio. We’re incredibly confident in our team and our processes to deliver a clean and safe environment. We use cleaning products that are specifically designed for sterilizing our studios, bikes, and towels to stop the spread of any illnesses.” Let’s keep in touch!
