Charles Grassley. “Mr. Chairman, I could not even attempt to do this without Louise, my wife of more than 20 years. The sacrifices she has made and her open and giving heart leaves me in awe. I love you so much.” \nThat’s when Gorsuch embraced his wife and his voice cracked ever so slightly, so you knew he meant every word he said. Shortly thereafter, he went into a short discussion of how the couple met and eventually married. \n“We started off in a place very different than this one, tiny apartment, little to show for it. And when Louise’s mother first came to visit, she was concerned by the conditions, understandably. As I headed out the door to work, I’ll never forget her whispering to her daughter in a voice I think intended to be just loud enough for me to hear, ‘Are you sure he’s really a lawyer?'”   \nHe spoke about a judge whose name was Increase Sumner and about the words written on Sumner’s tombstone that remind him of what he hopes to become. \n“As a lawyer, he was faithful and able. As a judge, patient, impartial, decisive. In private life, he was affectionate and mild. In public life, he was dignified and firm. Party feuds were allayed by the correctness of his conduct. Calumny was silenced by the weight of his virtues and rancor softened by the amenity of his manners.” \nGorsuch keeps those words on his desk. \n“If confirmed,” he said, “I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to be that man.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:35:23.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
