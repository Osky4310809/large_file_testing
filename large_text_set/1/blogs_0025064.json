Two weeks ago, the trio of Charlie Colkett, Fankaty Dabo, and Islam Feruz joined on loan. Today, the slightly older Dion Conroy arrived as well, in part thanks to the trio’s recommendation, though on an actual permanent transfer for an undisclosed fee. CONFIRMED | New signing @dionjc95 will wear number 2⃣5⃣ for Town this season #WelcomeDion ⚪️⚽️ pic.twitter.com/7yjDQmxKzU — Swindon Town FC (@Official_STFC) January 27, 2017 Conroy had a year and a half left on his Chelsea contract, and he had to be recalled from Aldershot Town after extending his loan with them just a few days ago. The 21-year-old center back signed a 2.5-year deal with Swindon and even though his jacket says no.35 but his shirt says no.25, he is looking forward to playing regularly at a higher level than at Aldershot. “I’m very excited to be here. Swindon is a very big club and I’m just looking forward to getting started and playing.” “I found out on Wednesday that coming here was a possibility and it just all happened really quickly. I’m just happy to properly join and get everything signed – I’m looking forward to playing!” “Everyone knows about Swindon so it is obviously a very big club and to be involved with the first-team here is very exciting. Hopefully I can bring something to the team and help the club win points.” “One of the main attractions for me was the chance to play regularly and develop my game so hopefully I can get game time and show everyone what I can do. I want to work hard, get my head down, get used to everything and get in the team and help them out.” “I’m just looking forward to playing for Swindon.” -Dion Conroy; source: Swindon Town FC Conroy joined Chelsea at age 12 and had made almost 100 appearances for various youth teams before heading out on his first loan this past summer. Best of luck to him in Swindon!  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:36:04.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
