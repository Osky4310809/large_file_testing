Mourinho still remembers the backing he received from the board at the start of the season (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nAccording to the Manchester Evening News , Mourinho has nothing but praise for the job they are doing and insists it has not been at the expense of the English old-school values. \nAddressing the changing face of football club ownership in England and the pressures it has brought, Mourinho said: “The most important quality for a manager in this multifunctional job is to know how to deal with pressure, meaning in the current environment where football is a passion for normal people, but for others, it is an industry.” \nHe told France Football : “Even in this country (England), which is home to tradition and stability, everything is in the process of becoming screwed up. The clubs are owned by foreign investors, no longer by traditional English people with the policies that came with that. The Glazers are determined to strengthen the United brand (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \n“Last season, I was sacked by Chelsea six months after becoming champion. The same of Ranieri this season with Leicester. This job is becoming crazy! \n“For Ranieri, I think it was the success which was impossible to duplicate. He did something that he could not repeat. And people in the club were not loyal enough to understand that. \n“It seemed obvious that, this season, they were going to find themselves in this situation. They did not understand that. They sacrificed their magician.

I am lucky to have stable, intelligent owners who understand the English mentality in terms of the project and patience,” he added. \n“The problem, is that modern society is toppling this stability. I lost matches at the beginning of the season, or sometimes I did not win them. I felt the confidence of my board. They said to me: “You have time, work. We believe in you.” Outside, it was different.” poll loading Do you love or hate Jose Mourinho? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:58:09.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
