While removing an unwanted object from a photo with Inpaint is easy, it may still consume a lot of time if you have a whole bunch of pictures to process. Batch removal of typical objects from images is what Batch Inpaint is designed for. \nWatermarks, time stamps, glitches, scratches, facial wrinkles, power lines, persons accidentally caught by the camera in the very moment of a shot and other things can be effortlessly erased from photos in automatic mode.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T10:33:46.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
