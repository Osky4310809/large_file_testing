Cities are dense enough that drivers typically have deliveries grouped relatively close together. \nBut rural routes are more spread out, and thus more expensive. If drones can handle some of those deliveries, the company can be more efficient along those areas and lower some costs, Dodero said. \nHe declined to say whether the company's workforce could be trimmed by attrition as UPS expands drone delivery. \n\"We have no idea how all that will play out until we find out how to integrate them into the business,\" he said. However, Dodero added UPS is not looking to use drones as a replacement for drivers. \n\"UPS is never looking to replace our UPS drivers,\" he said, calling them \"the face of our company.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:50:58.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
