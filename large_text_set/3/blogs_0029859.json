Now some new images from the new cinematic adaptation of Stephen King 's It have surfaced courtesy of USA Today . Find the creature hanging around above and more pictures further down the page. \nDirected this time by Andrés Muschietti , the new It represents the first big screen adaptation of King's 1989 horror tome. The setting is the quiet town of Derry, Maine, where a group of kids known as the Losers' Club set out to try to stop the monster (played here by Bill Skarsgård ) who has been snatching children every 30 years. \n“It happens in the book, this coming of age and kids facing their own mortality, which is something that in real life happens in a more progressive way and slowed down,” Muschietti tells USA Today . “There’s a passage in It that reads, 'Being a kid is learning how to live and being an adult is learning how to die.' There’s a bit of a metaphor of that and it just happens in a very brutal way, of course.” \nAnd the story will be told across two movies, with this one featuring the kids' struggle against the evil and the second following what happens when their enemy resurfaces after they've grown up and largely lost their memories of him. “It’s about remembering things that they have forgot,\" says Muschietti. \"Getting back in touch with those memories is such an important part of the plot,\" says Muschietti. There are hints in this film that make you think about what will happen 30 years later when Pennywise comes again.\" For more, head to USA Today 's site . \nThe first It will be in UK cinemas from 8 September. And you can read more from the director in the latest Empire , available now in all good and evil newsagents. But not your local sewer system. \nOh, and because this is usually the way things go, the trailer will be with us on Wednesday...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:33:16.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
