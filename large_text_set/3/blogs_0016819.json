And the chain is rolling out fresh beef patties to hundreds of its stores.\nConsumerist reports that, so far, the fresh patties have been tested in only a handful of stores — 14 in Dallas, 75 in Oklahoma — but that they’re doing so well that McDonald’s is sending them to more than 300 stores in the Texas area, beginning what could be a national rollout for the home of the Big Mac and The Shamrock Shake . And now that McDonald’s has also vowed to fix their ice cream machines , it looks like the chain is poised for something great. \nFrom Consumerist : \n“We view this latest expansion of never-frozen beef for quarter-pound beef patties as another signal as to the direction McDonald’s US is likely to head — more test markets/restaurants are likely to introduce never-frozen beef in coming months,” Instinet Analyst Mark Kalinowski wrote in a note to clients.\nDon’t expect the change to be immediate — McDonald’s will have to figure out how it will supply the beef to franchisees as well as deal with any new food safety issues — but you shouldn’t be surprised if you see fresh beef patties at a store near you soon. As one franchisee noted, “customers perceive unfrozen to be better for you. Perception is everything.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:44:11.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
