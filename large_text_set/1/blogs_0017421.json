This is one estimate of the amount emissions need to stay under to limit total human-induced warming to less than 2C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66%. \nFull details of how this figure was determined are in the IPCC Synthesis Report here . \nThe rate of emissions is based on the most recent year of global emissions from the Global Carbon Project , and assumes no increase or decrease in emissions year-to-year as a ‘business as usual’ scenario.
