On the other side of the coin, Australia will retain its pre-series points if it wins the series 4-1 while it will concede one point if it wins 3-2. Australia can fall from the top pedestal but to make it happen Pakistan will have to win by 4-1 or better. \nHowever, considering that Australia leads Pakistan 33-16 head to head in its backyard including 15 wins in 19 ODIs this decade, this looks highly improbable. \nThe ODI team rankings, unlike the Test rankings, are updated after each match and the ODI predictor function is available here . \nHost England and the seven highest-ranked sides on the MRF Tyres ICCODI Team Rankings as on 30 September 2017 will qualify directly for the event to be held from May 30 to July 15, 2019. The four bottom-ranked sides will be joined by six teams from the ICC World Cricket League in the 10 team ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2018 and the top two sides will complete the 10 team World Cup lineup. \nMeanwhile, third-ranked India takes on fifth-ranked England in a three-match ODI series starting in Pune on Sunday, January 15. While India will be aiming to narrow the gap with second-ranked South Africa, England will be targeting an upward movement. \nIndia can rise to as high as 114 points if it sweeps the series but if the series result is reversed, then England can move up one place to fourth and India can slide to fifth. 0 0 Pakistan in 'serious danger' of failing to qualify directly for World Cup was posted in sports of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on January 11, 2017 and was last updated on January 11, 2017.
