His death was ruled an accident. \nBond was the captain of the Under 18 National Team with the Wissahickon Skating Club in Chestnut Hill, WPVI Channel 6 reports . \nPhilly.com reports it's unclear how Bond was injured; he did not tell anyone he had been hit, and parents and coaches did not see him take a hard hit. \nThe death has left members of the skating club in mourning, philly.com reports. \n\"He was, without question, the epitome of what we want most in our children,\" said Kevin Hamel, the Wissahickon Skating Club president.
