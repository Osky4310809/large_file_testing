Nwogu, who was arrested by the police on Wednesday and ordered to issue apologies on all his social media platforms, said on Instagram that his action was well intended. He, however, added that he would use other means to “create the necessary awareness.” The photos of the 30-year-old club owner putting leashes on some women during weddings had gone viral on the Internet. Some Nigerians, who were appalled by the display, called for the arrest and prosecution of Nwogu for dehumanising women. The police on Wednesday reportedly arrested Nwogu for turning women into human puppies with chains around their necks. The arrest was said to have been made on the orders of the Lagos State Government. Nwogu was reportedly released after making an undertaking to desist from the act. According to the undertaking, Nwogu allegedly admitted knowing that his action was against the law and pledged not to further indulge in such behaviour. The undertaking read in part, “I, Mike Eze Nwalie, aka Pretty Mike , of 21A Luma Street, Magodo GRA, do hereby undertake to stop whatever act of putting girls on leashes or any other degrading treatment to ladies and guys. “I am aware that such act offends the law of Lagos State and if I repeat it, there will be legal action towards me. “I undertake to issue a letter of apology to the public effective from tomorrow (Thursday) on all my social media platforms.” However, the apology issued by Nwogu on his Instagram page, said his action was wrongly interpreted. He said, “There has been a lot of controversy over two of my outings holding some females on a leash. I apologise to all the women and the good people of Lagos State, Nigeria and the rest of the world, who feel dehumanised by this craft that meant well. I will use other platforms and formats to continue to create the necessary awareness.” The Lagos State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Adeniji Kazeem, in a statement on Thursday noted that the government would not tolerate any anti-social behaviour. Kazeem restated government’s determination to prosecute anybody who violated any law of the state under any guise. “The Lagos State Government is committed to the protection of the rights of all citizens, including children, women and all the vulnerable persons in the state,” he said. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Dolapo Badmos, said the case was still under investigation. Meanwhile, a comedian, Wale Gates, said the government shouldn’t have arrested Nwogu. In a series of tweets on Thursday, he said, “Arresting Pretty Mike is an overreaction and an overreach. Why couldn’t we as a society reject him without the government forming morality police.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:51:12.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
