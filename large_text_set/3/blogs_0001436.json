And it does -- it helps it feel better and it worked.\" \nRush's hands still measured up as the smallest among the QBs here. But he cited his performance in some bad-weather games as evidence that won't stop him. \nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero . \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL scouting combine Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
