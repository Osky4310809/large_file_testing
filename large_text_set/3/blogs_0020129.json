Some were shouting and as they ran off in different directions, a group of around a dozen people dashed around the corner into Parliament Square. \nWhen they reached the iron double gates used as the vehicle entrance to New Palace Yard, - through which Theresa May had driven hours earlier when she arrived for Prime Minister’s Questions - they appeared to rush the gates, which are always manned by two uniformed policemen. Westminster terror attack shooting in pics \nF rom my vantage point directly opposite the gates, it was difficult to tell whether the gates had been forced open or the policemen had allowed people in to give them sanctuary. But it was quickly clear that Parliament was under attack. \nP olice officers in yellow high-vis jackets appeared to be making a grab for some of the intruders. People who had been about to leave through the pedestrian exit next to the vehicle gate turned around and ran for their lives towards Westminster Hall. Journalists in the press corridor began shouting to each other. “Oh my God, we’re being attacked!” shouted one.

Policemen darted in different directions, clearly struggling to make sense of what was going on. \nThen, the confirmation that this was an attack on Parliament: a man who appeared to be carrying a knife, who got around 25 yards inside the gates, was rushing towards a policeman who pulled a pistol and fired three shots into his chest from around six feet away. Knocked off his feet by the impact of the bullets, he fell backwards onto the cobbles. Westminster Bridge scene \nI nside the building, journalists started to fear for their own lives, terrified that this might be a marauding attack and that accomplices might be trying to enter the building. \n“What do we do? Do we run?” my colleagues asked. I told them to stay put, and within a minute a female uniformed police officer appeared at the door of our office telling us to stay where we were, to shut the door and stay put. \nWe were drawn back to the window, despite knowing that the advice is to stay away from windows in the event of a terrorist attack.

I hadn’t seen the policeman being injured but his colleagues and a man in a suit were frantically giving him CPR. \nA round 15 yards from him, a man in a high-vis jacket was pumping the chest of the man who had been shot. \nWe still had no idea whether we were safe. Watching what was happening at least provided a distraction from our own fears. Images of the Mumbai attack flashed through my mind as I wondered whether a terrorist had managed to get into the building. Westminster attack locator map \nA cross the patch of grass in the centre of New Palace Yard, I looked at the ramp to the underground car park and remembered black and white images of the last terrorist attack on the Parliamentary estate, when the Conservative MP Airey Neave was killed by an IRA car bomb on that spot in 1979. \nMy heart racing, I made brief phone calls to the Telegraph newsdesk to alert them to what was going on, to my partner to reassure her I was safe, and began tweeting my first reports of what I had seen. Only then did I see others tweeting about the car ploughing into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. \nAn air ambulance landed in the middle of Parliament Square. Moments later two ambulances arrived and paramedics took over from the police officers attending to the two people on the ground.
