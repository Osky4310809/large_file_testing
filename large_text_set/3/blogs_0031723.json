Credit should go to the Indian team and its fighting qualities for bouncing back in the series after being walloped by 333 runs in the first Test in Pune. Emotions ran high throughout the series, but that may have been merely an outcome of its competitiveness and intensity as the Australians played hard and India gave back as good as it got.\nThe Indian team may well revolve around Kohli and spin bowler Ravichandran Ashwin, but the fact that only Cheteshwar Pujara, Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja played all 13 Test matches at home this season is a clear indication of its rich talent pool. Captain Steve Smith was outstanding for the Aussies as he scored the highest in the series with 499 runs, which included three centuries. Jadeja’s all-round consistency made him the third player ever to score over 500 runs and take over 50 wickets in a season.\nIndia maintains its lead as the number one Test team with a rating of 122 points, while Australia is second with 108 points. The series win also made India only the third team ever to hold the Test series honours against all nine Test playing nations. But India was pushed to the brink by the Aussies on home ground, which suggests Kohli and the Indian team will have their task cut out when they play abroad and team performance inevitably declines, going by past precedent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:05:18.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
