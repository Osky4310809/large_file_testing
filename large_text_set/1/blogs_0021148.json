He joined Torry Holt and Marvin Harrison as the only players in the NFL history with five seasons of at least 90 catches and 1,000 yards. \nThomas' five-season streak of at least 1,000 yards receiving is the longest active streak in the league and second-longest in Broncos history, behind Rod Smith's six-season run from 1997-02. \nThomas, 29, ranks No. 3 in team history in career catches (546), receiving yards (7,704) and receiving touchdowns (74), behind behind Smith and Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe, respectively, in each category. Including the playoffs, however, Thomas bests both with 34 career 100-yard receiving games. \nThe payout for players on the winning Pro Bowl team year is $61,000, while losing players each get $30,000. The game will air at 6 p.m. MT (ESPN) from Camping World Stadium in Orlando.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:04:43.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
