Go and wake your students, Horace. \" — Professor McGonagall 's warning right before the battle begins [src] Slughorn casting Protego Maxima in preparation for the Battle of Hogwarts \nSlughorn stayed at Hogwarts under the tenure of Severus Snape as Headmaster and, like the rest of the teachers, attempted to protect the students from Snape and the Carrows . He finally found out what Voldemort had wanted to recruit him for and was surprised that it was only to teach the pure and half blooded students he would allow to attend Hogwarts. [8] \nWhen the Dark Lord invaded the castle with his army, it was initially believed that Slughorn had fled in cowardice, but as it transpired, he had gone to Hogsmeade to round up reinforcements. He returned to the castle at the head of vast number of residents and shopkeepers from the town, several Slytherin students who also returned to defend the school, and the friends and family of the students and staff already fighting. [8] Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn after the final battle \nSlughorn engaged the Dark Lord head on, with McGonagall and Kingsley , proving himself a masterful duellist, able to hold his own against the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time. [13] Slughorn was one of the last to duel Voldemort before his death, believing he could find redemption for what he told him many years earlier about Horcruxes. [8] \nAfter the battle, he sat at the Great Hall by Pomona Sprout and Filius Flitwick , telling of how he had lost his wand during the fighting, but eventually found it in the folds of his gowns and \"dispatched\" a few Death Eaters . [14] Later life (post 1998) \nHis bravery at the Battle of Hogwarts was well publicised and changed the perception of Slytherin. He retired by 2016 and had the honour of having a portrait of himself placed in the Slytherin common room. [8] [15] Physical appearance Albus Dumbledore : \" I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace. \" Slughorn : \" It's all in the upholstery, I come by the padding naturally. \" — Albus Dumbledore and Horace Slughorn [src] Horace a portly, balding old man \nSlughorn was described as being an enormously fat, bald, old man. He was short with an immense belly, so large that the buttons on his waistcoat usually threatened to burst off. His round stomach was usually said to precede him when he entered rooms, and when he stood, the top of his head barely reached Albus Dumbledore 's chin. His girth was seen to take up most of the compartment of the Hogwarts Express and occupy at least a quarter of Honeydukes Sweet Shop. He was described as having a shiny pate, prominent, gooseberry coloured eyes, and an enormous, silver, walrus-like moustache. \nIn his youth, his moustache was gingery blond and his hair was thick and straw coloured. He had pudgy hands, fat thumbs, and a vast forehead, as well as highly polished buttons on his maroon velvet jacket that he wore over his lilac silk pyjamas. Slughorn had a particular liking of lavish, old-fashioned clothes: waistcoats with gold buttons during the day and luxurious velvet smoking jackets when at home. In one particular trip to Hogsmeade , he wore an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar and clutched a large bag of crystallised pineapple. When he duelled Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts , he wore an emerald-green pair of silk pyjamas. He claimed to suffer from old age, fatigue, rheumatism , and a weak chest. According to Harry, he seemed remarkably unabashed for someone whom he had just seen pretending to be an armchair. \nHowever, he was still sufficiently agile to turn himself into an armchair and create a scene of chaos at short notice when he was trying to avoid unwelcome visitors, and managed to live on the run from Voldemort moving house every couple of weeks (including his grand piano ). He had a liking for embroidered clothing, with gold coloured buttons and plenty of velvet. [10] His comforts included soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions, all of which cluttered the room he met Harry in. His largeness fit his personality: he was jolly and genial, bustling around, twiddling the ends of his walrus moustache, and puffing out his massive belly. He sometimes wore a silver pocket watch . Personality and traits Edit \" Harry wasn't sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born should make a good witch. \" — Harry Potter 's feelings about Horace Slughorn [src] \nHorace Slughorn was described as having a bumbling, jovial sort of personality. He was rather vain and quite fond of food, especially crystallised pineapple. Despite being a relatively good-natured person, he only had eyes for people who he thought had talent, would go far in life, and thus give him helpful connections and be able to influence or gain benefits from them. Thus, while he invited other students to his \" Slug Club ,\" he had a tendency to rudely ignore people like Ronald Weasley because he didn't view them as important, talented, or famous enough to warrant his attention. Horace Slughorn talking to Harry Potter , whom he tried to collect \nSlughorn is also a bit of a hypocrite, as he told Harry he believed teachers should not have favourites but then proceeded to say that Harry's mother, Lily Evans , was one of his. Shortly after this encounter, Dumbledore told Harry that in fact, while Slughorn was a teacher, he formed a group of his favourite students with him at the centre in order to forge connections, make introductions, and always reap some sort of benefit from them. In addition, he says he isn't prejudiced against Muggle-born students, but seemed surprised that Harry said Hermione Granger was the best in his year; despite this, he asserts that Lily was one of the most talented students he ever taught, and frequently compares Harry's talent to hers in very favourable terms. It seems Slughorn feels that pure-blood students usually displayed the best talent but was happy to bring Muggle-borns or half-bloods into his inner circle if he thought they were talented or gifted enough. \nCompared to Snape, Slughorn's teaching methods were more friendly, excitable and interactive, not unlike how a good-natured laboratory professor conducts lessons. He also appears to know how to motivate students for his subject; in his first Potions lesson since coming out of retirement, he encouraged his students to concoct for him the Draught of Living Death with a ready bottle of Felix Felicis as reward to the student who does best. He also exhibited no qualms at using his school connections to procure useful assets for his own benefit, as seen when he convinced Pomona Sprout to provide him with plant samples as potion ingredients fresh from the Hogwarts Greenhouses, or when he took advantage of Hagrid's attendant despair to retrieve some of Aragog 's prized venom, along with the stocks of unicorn hair Hagrid had inside his cabin. \" I have had it all tested for poison. Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend, Rupert. \" —Slughorn pouring the wine for Harry and Hagrid [src] \nSlughorn generally displayed the more positive traits of Slytherin , such as ambition. He never wished to be famous himself; instead, he preferred to help others become famous, which, if successful, gained him influence and/or benefits from them, such as being able to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office , free Quidditch tickets or a box of his favourite crystallised pineapple. By his own admittance, he reveres creatures such as Acromantula , and thought Aragog was a magnificent specimen. [10] Slughorn has evident self-centredness; he mentioned that all the mead he brought is quite safe as he had a house-elf drink some from each bottle to ensure it was not poisoned. This revelation disquieted Harry, as it showed that Slughorn saw nothing wrong with risking a house-elf's life to protect his own. Although, there is the possibility Slughorn possessed an antidote to give the house-elf if poison was present in the drink. The aforementioned possibility is extremely likely due to Slughorn's knowledge of antidotes and generally kind and caring nature, and due to his general determination not to repeat dangerous past mistakes. \nSlughorn was keen to make evermore connections, and in his post as teacher, made a habit of having regular meetings with students who were either famous ( Harry Potter ), related to famous people ( Cormac McLaggen ), or gifted or talented in one way or another (i.e. Hermione Granger , Ginny Weasley ). Known as \"the Slug Club ,\" this group of students were constantly being invited to Slughorn's office for dinner and parties. Students that he did not consider to be \"high-fliers,\" such as Arthur Weasley , and later his son Ron , were simply ignored. However, those with proven negative affiliations, such as Draco Malfoy , due to his father being a Death Eater and imprisoned in Azkaban, weren't invited to the club meetings either. [10] Horace Slughorn after a first year class \nSlughorn's personality, in many ways, contradicted the \"evil Slytherin\" stereotype held by many students of the other Houses, Gryffindors in particular. He wasn't a bad person, and didn't seem to hold any real prejudice against Muggle-born witches and wizards. While he thought pure-bloods generally had more wizarding talent, he was always happy to meet and teach Muggle-borns and half-bloods who displayed great potential. He was, however, self-serving enough to favour students of status or talent, largely for the purpose of benefiting from his connection to them in the future. He was horribly guilt-ridden about the information he gave to Tom Riddle about Horcruxes , and crudely edited his memory of the event to prevent anyone finding out what he had done, as much as to relieve his own guilty feelings. Though Albus Dumbledore would undoubtedly have tried in earnest to convey the importance of the contents of the original memory, Slughorn stubbornly refused to give it up till 1997 . He was also horrified at his accidental poisoning of Ron Weasley and later came to visit him in the hospital. [10] \nDespite his ambition, Slughorn knew where to draw his personal boundaries. His tendency to ally himself with powerful, talented, and important people never blinded him to his moral values, and thus, he was never tempted to join forces with Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Unlike Peter Pettigrew , Dolores Umbridge and others who were keen to surround themselves with big people, he was not one to side with whoever was winning. Slughorn knew where his loyalties lay, and he fought against Lord Voldemort head on during the final battle. \nDuring the final battle it was initially thought that Slughorn fled in cowardice with the other Slytherins , but he had actually only left to round up reinforcements and returned to the battle. This, along with the fact that he fearlessly stood up to Voldemort himself, showed that he was a courageous man. While he initially attempted to hide and avoid getting himself into any danger or conflict, he was willing to defend himself and other people when his loyalties were questioned, when backed to a corner and when it was necessary to defend those he cared about. He was also strong willed and was able to master Occlumency, a rare ability that required a strong mind. \nSlughorn possessed a great ability to feel shame and regret for his mistakes, many of which he often tried to cover up, hide from, or when it came down to it, fight with all of his magical power. His determination not repeat past mistakes or to lay them to rest is rather evident in his handing Harry the horcrux memory and his duel with Voldemort. He clearly regards his giving of information about the possibility of multiple horcruxes to young Tom Riddle to be his greatest mistake. \nSlughorn is a rather analytical and calculating individual, able to see great potential in students, but also has his blind spots as well, such his overlooking of Ron Weasley's latent talents. His analytical abilities and mindset allowed him to deduce Harry's early attempts to coax the horcrux memory from him. In many ways, not only does Slughorn possess an inordinately strong moral compass, but also the consummate strategist, such as when he fetched necessary reinforcements from Hogsmeade to aid in the Battle of Hogwarts. This propensity towards strategy and making powerful alliances is compliant with the Slytherin traits of cunning and fraternity, as Slytherins will take calculated risks and always have a backup plan, usually relying on staunch and stalwart allies, something that Slughorn is a certifiable genius at. Magical abilities and skills Edit Slughorn : \" What would the Death Eaters want with a poor, broken-down old buffer like me? \" Albus Dumbledore : \" I imagine that they would want to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and murder. \" — Dumbledore regarding what Voldemort would with Slughorn's abilities [src] \nHorace Slughorn was a very powerful wizard, with a wide variety of skills. Lucius Malfoy commended his son about Slughorn's competence and Albus Dumbledore respected Slughorn's abilities, saying that he was an extremely able wizard. Occlumency : Horace was an extremely able Occlumens, being able to shield his mind against even a wizard of Albus Dumbledore's calibre. Memory modification : Horace was able to modify his own memory to make it seem something less horrible, as seen in the case of Tom Riddle asking about Horcruxes. However, this was crudely done, as parts of the memory were clouds with a booming voice, rather than an actual visual. Indomitable Will: The fact that Slughorn was capable of performing Occlumency and avoid giving his real memory to Dumbledore and Harry showed that his willpower was extremely strong. This was especially evident as he was unwilling to join forces with Dark Wizards like Voldemort despite his tendency to ally himself with powerful people and ultimately fought against Voldemort head on during the Battle of Hogwarts. Transfiguration : Despite his wide frame, Horace was extremely agile, being able to create the impression of a struggle within his house in a matter of seconds and transforming himself into an armchair; human transfiguration is something only a master of that art could accomplish. [10] Duelling : Slughorn was a master duellist, being able to survive the battle of Hogwarts and hold his own against even Lord Voldemort himself. However it should be noted that he fought alongside Minerva McGonagall and Kingsley Shacklebolt . It is also known that during the battle he was a capable fighter, (or at least a good enough one) to be able to \"dispatch a few of them\" as he claimed to Professor's Flitwick and Sprout after the battle. Also, although Voldemort was wielding the Elder Wand at the time, the Dark Lord had not unlocked the Wand's full power. Plus, Harry Potter 's loving sacrifice was preventing Voldemort from fatally harming anyone who opposed him. [13] Potioneer : Perhaps chief among Slughorn's many talents was his ability as a potioneer. Slughorn was able to create extremely complicated Potions such as Felix Felicis , the Polyjuice Potion , and Amortentia . He was a master on Potions, as he taught the subject up to N.E.W.T. level, and was seen to be at least an equal to Severus Snape in the subject, as he understood and agreed with Snape's edits of a copy of Advanced Potion-Making . He also fully understood Golpalott's Third Law to the letter and was flawlessly proficient with Antidotes as he was able to recite a long and complicated theory of them to a class of N.E.W.T students and swiftly, with no effort, make a perfect remedy for a very powerful Amortentia [10] Non-verbal magic : In 1996 , Slughorn and Albus Dumbledore fully restored an entire room that had been torn to pieces with \"one identical sweeping motion\" of their wands and neither said anything. He extracted one of his own memories from his temple for Harry Potter with no incantation. It is also not mentioned that Horace said anything during his duel with Voldemort . Charms : Slughorn was able to fix a whole room with one spell (with Dumbledore's help), give Harry one of his memories and cast the Anapneo charm easily and without fail. Defence Against the Dark Arts : Since Slughorn knew quite a lot about the theory of Dark Magic and was able to duel the most powerful Dark Wizard ever it can be assumed that he knew a good deal of advanced defensive magic. He also helped cast an extremely powerful shield around Hogwarts that temporarily kept Voldemort and his minions at bay. Dark Arts knowledge : Considering he was the one who taught the young Tom Riddle what horcruxes were, it is obvious that Professor Slughorn had a high level of knowledge on the Dark Arts. Although Tom Riddle was a brilliant student, he was not capable of discovering the true nature of horcruxes, without help from Slughorn. Social Networking: Slughorn is a seasoned and gifted individual in his ability form powerful and lasting connections throughout his career as a teacher. His ability to form connections for himself and others makes him a valuable ally to have and has been able to capitalise on this skill of his for decades for both self-serving and selfless reasons. He is also a master rallyman, easily able to stir the citizens of Hogsmeade into a war frenzy and gain their support to add their power to Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Love : Though not as demonstrably learned in this branch of magic as his peer and colleague, Albus Dumbledore, Slughorn is still extremely knowledgable and powerful in the nature of love. This was evident when teaching love potions as he was able to distinguish between the obsessive love caused by love potions and the genuine, unconditional love felt by most people. He is clearly capable of love, as it allowed him to overcome his shame of the horcrux memory and to give it to Harry as a weapon to end the monster he felt partially responsible for creating, as it was Voldemort who killed so many of his beloved students, especially Lily Evans, who Slughorn was extremely fond of and doted upon as one of his most prized pupils. Slughorn also felt great need to protect his students, regardless of favouritism, as was his most redeeming quality. It was also his ability to love which gave Slughorn the strength to ultimately show his true loyalties and fight against Voldemort himself head on. Possessions Edit Horace's wand Wand : Slughorn likely purchased his wand from Ollivanders at the age of eleven before starting his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , like many other wizards in wizarding Great Britain . It is 10 1/4\" long and comprised of Cedar wood with a core of dragon heartstring. The handle has two prongs extending out of the end, which might relate to his surname 'Slughorn'. Hourglass Hourglass : Slughorn's hourglass is a clock made of two glass vessels connected with a narrow passage, with a green fluid flowing through inside and serpent design outside (representing him as a Slytherin and Head of House ). He owned it since before Tom Riddle began studying at Hogwarts. The sand runs accordingly to the quality of the conversation: if stimulating, the sand runs slowly, and vice versa. Dragon-skin Briefcase : Horace also owned a rather expensive briefcase made of prized Dragon-skin which he uses to hold his personal things, mainly documents related to the subject he teaches at school. Potion-making kit : This is where Slughorn stored his ready supply of potion ingredients. Horace pulled out several components inside it to mix up an antidote for Ron's love potion-induced lovesickness upon Harry's request to cure his friend. It is also from here where Slughorn placed a bezoar that Harry showed him in one of their lessons. Piano : Horace owned a piano. When he used to escape from Death Eaters, he took the piano with him, making sure \"neighbours don't spot him bringing in the piano\" Antidote to Veritaserum (Suspected) : Dumbledore suspects that ever since he requested Slughorn to divulge the memory regarding Tom Riddle asking about Horcruxes, the Potions Master has kept a side of antidote to veritaserum as a precaution for any further attempts.
