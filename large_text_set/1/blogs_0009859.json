But which ones, specifically, should you plant? The answer to that question depends, in part, on what you wish to accomplish. \nPeople's tastes and goals in landscaping vary greatly, so I can't tell you what to plant. But I can point you in the right direction by placing the relevant information at your fingertips. My objective here is twofold: To offer examples of shrubs that grow in shade To make sure that there is sufficient variety in my choices, such that there will be something for everybody -- regardless of your landscaping tastes and goals \nConsequently, the examples of shrubs that grow in shade presented below are a diverse lot. Depending on your particular landscaping needs, one of them may be just the bush you need to shine a little light upon a heretofore drab nook in your yard. Once you are done investigating the examples on the present page, have a look at the complementary set of examples I offer of shrubs that need full sunshine to look their best. 'Minuet' is a mountain laurel cultivar with deep pink flowers. David Beaulieu 1. Mountain Laurels \nMountain laurel ( Kalmia latifolia ) is a native plant in eastern North America. Its natural habitat is in woodland areas, where it is shaded by trees. \nWhat do they have to offer in landscaping, perhaps you wonder? Well, for one thing, they sport glossy evergreen leaves. If that fact does not win you over, consider also that they produce showy clusters of flowers in late spring . Finally, cultivars have been developed just for use in the landscape, including the dwarf 'Minuet' laurel , which I show in my picture here. The color of the flowers on this cultivar is more vibrant than that on wild mountain laurels. More » \ncontinue reading below our video Red Wine? No Problem. 5 Secret Stain-Busting Fixes Koichi Oda/flickr CC 2.0 2. Japanese Rose \nAmong deciduous shrubs, Japanese rose ( Kerria japonica ) is among the most shade-tolerant. Let me explain what I mean by that. \nThere are many shrubs that grow in shade, in the sense that they will not die for lack of sunlight there. But that is not really the point, is it? You want more than for a bush to survive, you want it to thrive. If it is flowers that you desire, you want a full display of blooms, not a sparse sprinkling here and there. \nThat is why Japanese rose made my list. It furnishes a good display of flowers in partial shade. But again, your choice will depend on what you want. If it is fall foliage color you crave, you may prefer arrowwood viburnums .

Climbing Hydrangea \nAs their name suggests, climbing hydrangeas ( Hydrangea anomala ssp. petiolaris ) are shade-tolerant vines , but I include them here because they can be trimmed so as to maintain them as if they were shrubs. While they tolerate shaded areas , they tend to yield better flowering displays when exposed to a reasonable amount of sunlight. Peeling bark provides winter interest. More » Picture of daphne with its white flowers. David Beaulieu 4. Carol Mackie Daphne \nAs with climbing hydrangeas (above), the blooming of 'Carol Mackie' daphne shrubs may be enhanced if the plants receive sufficient sunlight. But this fact is hardly problematic, as these plants are worth growing for their variegated leaves , alone. \nNot that their flowering is not noteworthy. And I say this not so much regarding the appearance of their blossoms as regarding the smell. They are truly wonderfully aromatic. More » Gary J. Wood/flickr CC 2.0 5. Emerald and Gold Euonymus \nEmerald and Gold euonymus is another bush with bi-colored leaves; in this case, the name tells you exactly what those two colors are. The gold part of that tandem will be brighter the more sun the bush gets, but it nevertheless is worthy of consideration as a shrub that grows in shade. \nThere are many kinds of euonymus. One is quite notorious as an invasive plant and is called, in common parlance, \" burning bush .\" While this is a shrub that grows in shade, lack of sufficient sunlight may rob it of its one selling point: its fall color. More » Ilex crenata 'Hetzii' has concave leaves. David Beaulieu 6. Hetz Japanese Holly \nThis entry and the next are both Japanese hollies ( Ilex crenata ). Compared to American and English hollies, Ilex crenata has small leaves, reminiscent of boxwood . The latter is another shrub that grows in shade and is a legendary hedge plant . \nIt was its resemblance to boxwood that spurred my initial interest in Hetz Japanese holly. Unlike the hollies with which you may be more familiar, the berries on this type are black, not red. More » Have a tight spot near the house? Ilex crenata 'Sky Pencil,' a narrow, columnar bush, could be just the right plant to grow. David Beaulieu 7. Sky Pencil Hollies \nIt is not flowering displays, fall-foliage color, and two-toned leaves alone that catch our attention when we peruse people's landscaping. Another component sure to stand out is any of the so-called \"architectural\" plants. 'Sky Pencil' holly is one such plant. \nYou can't miss this column-shaped bush. And once you have identified it, you will never forget it. Even the name is memorable, being highly descriptive. More » The hemlock shrubs in this picture flank a driveway entrance function as a privacy screen. David Beaulieu 8. Hemlocks \nAll of the evergreen shrubs that I have presented so far are classified as broadleaf types. But with these last two entries, I move on to examples of needled evergreens. \nHemlocks can be trimmed so as to promote development of dense foliage, making them great for privacy screens . My full article about these shade-tolerant plants (accessed by clicking the link near the photo) begins by introducing Canadian hemlock trees, before proceeding to a discussion specifically of the shrub cultivars that would concern us here. You may not be familiar with these cultivars, but I assure you that they make for terrific hedges. More » Colin Varndell/Getty Images 9. Yews \nYews are somewhat notorious for being poisonous plants , but unless you have children or pets that will be grazing outside, this shouldn't be a major drawback. On a lighter note, yews are one of the plants in Christmas traditions . \nThese needled evergreens are valued for their showy red berries and as shrubs that grow in shade. Some people find them boring or overused, but the versatility of these tough bushes makes their case for them. Common plants are common for a reason: do not hold their popularity against them.

Andromeda: Shrubs for Shade That Are Evergreen, Flowering \nI conclude with a shade-tolerant bush that offers the best of both worlds, in terms of being not only a flowering shrub but also an evergreen . \nAndromeda shrubs ( Pieris japonica ) may offer something else, too: fragrant flowers . I say they \"may\" offer this feature, because whether you agree or not very much depends on your personal tastes. Some people find their smell offensive, while others find it pleasing. If you dislike strong flower aromas, you may land in the former group.
