Mendez Legaspi (philstar.com) | Updated March 23, 2017 - 4:05pm Binibining Pilipinas 2017 candidates in swimsuits designed by Jeffrey Rogador Binibining Pilipinas/Bruce Casanova \nMANILA, Philippines — “Aside from fashion, I love pageants!” said award-winning fashion designer Jeffrey Rogador. \nFor the past two years, Jeffrey has been designing the swimwear for the opening videos of the Binibining Pilipinas pageant. This year, he is tapped to do all the presentations with swimwear exposures---the press conference, TV plugs, official photoshoot, and coronation night. \n“Binibining Pilipinas Charities Inc. called me and asked me to be the official swimwear designer for Binibining Pilipinas 2017,” Jeffrey says. “I’ll be doing five to six swimsuits for the official 40 candidates.” (Unfortunately, that number has gone down to 39 as one candidate has resigned or has been disqualified.) \nJeffrey also did the swimwear for two editions of Century Tuna Superbods and the recent Miss San Fernando, La Union. \n“I gave sketches and designs to [BPCI], most of them two-piece with cutouts and plays on patterns and colors, then they chose and approved a particular design for each event. I made young and modern designs in terms of colors, looks, cuts and details. They requested for bright and happy colors. I just infused my DNA as an urbanwear designer because I don’t know which ones will be approved. ” \nFor the press presentation, Jeffrey used Spandex with chiffon wrap and color-blocking of neons. When the candidates sauntered in at the ballroom of the Novotel Hotel in Cubao, their JR Swimwear caressed every curve and showcased their toned physiques. “We did three fittings before the press presentation,” Jeffrey shares.   \n“Madam Stella [Marquez de Araneta, BPCI doyenne] is very keen with the fitting and how the swimwear hugs the body of the ladies,” he says, adding, “She’s happy with the swimwear.” \nWhat about the girls? “The candidates love the swimsuit.They were all asking if they can take it home.” \nCan they? “I’m not sure. It’s the decision of BPCI.” Photos by Bruce Casanova for Binibining Pilipinas \nCandidate no. 10 Jehza Mae Huelar Candidate no. 13 Sirene Sutton Candidate no. 15 Maria Angelica de Leon Candidate no. 18 Nelda Ibe Candidate no. 19 Rachel Peters Candidate no. 22 Chanel Olive Thomas Candidate no. 24 Dindi Joy Pajares Candidate no. 31 Katarina Sonja Rodriguez Candidate no. 32 Charmaine Elima Candidate no. 37 Sammie Anne Legaspi Fashion designer Jeffrey Rogador with Binibining Pilipinas 2017 candidates in his creations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:18:50.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
