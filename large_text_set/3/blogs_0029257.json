Hospitalization rates for opioid overdoses dropped 13 percent on average. \nAt the same time, fears that legalization of medical marijuana would lead to an uptick in cannabis-related hospitalizations proved unfounded, according to the report in Drug and Alcohol Dependence.

It seems plausible.\" \nHowever, she said, \"there is still much we need to understand about the mechanisms through which marijuana policy may affect opioid use and harms.\" \nAn estimated 60 percent of Americans now live in the 28 states and Washington, D.C. where medical marijuana is legal under state law. \nMeanwhile, the opioid epidemic - sparked by a quadrupling since 1999 in sales of prescription painkillers such as Oxycontin and Vicodin - kills 91 Americans a day. \nShi analyzed hospitalization records from 1997 through 2014 for 27 states, nine of which implemented medical marijuana policies. Her study was the fifth to show declines in opioid use or deaths in states that allow medical cannabis.

Bachhuber, a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, was not involved in the new study. \nRelated: Marijuana Users Risk Schizophrenia, But the Drug Helps Pain \nMany of Bachhuber's patients ask for help quitting highly addictive opioids, and some have used marijuana to taper off the prescription painkillers, he said. \nNonetheless, a 1970 federal law puts cannabis in the same category as heroin, Schedule 1 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, and finds it has no medicinal value. Consequently, doctors can only recommend, not prescribe, marijuana, and physicians who work for the federal government cannot even discuss the weed. \nFederal prohibition also has led to severe limitations on marijuana research.

David Zalubowski / AP \nIn January, a National Academies report found conclusive or substantial evidence that cannabis can effectively treat chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and spasticity. The report, written by an independent panel of medical experts, found no evidence of cannabis overdose deaths. \nIt did, however, find links between cannabis use and an increased risk of vehicle accidents as well as the development of schizophrenia or other psychoses, particularly among the most frequent users. \nBachhuber lamented the dearth of research on the best ways to use marijuana as medicine. \n\"We have information that it works based on the National Academies' report,\" he said. \"But we don't know who it works best for, at what dosage, for how long.\" \nLast week, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the nation's top cop, reiterated his concerns about marijuana and heroin, an illegal opioid. \n\"I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana,\" he told law enforcement officers in Virginia, \"so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another.\" \nSOURCE: Drug and Alcohol Dependence, online February 21, 2017.
