We’re so used to seeing our beloved Arya Stark in battle mode that we almost don’t recognize her when she’s all glammed up. \nThe Game of Thrones actress arrived at the awards ceremony rocking a stunning metallic pink gown, pairing it with a gorgeous dark berry lipstick. Seriously though, we hope this looks has casting directors making calls asking for her to star in a 1920s drama. \nCheck out Williams’ gorgeous SAG look below: \nDavid Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images The actress, who was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series alongside the rest of the Game of Thrones cast , may not be starring in another remake of The Great Gatsby anytime soon, but she is revealing some details about the upcoming seventh season of the HBO hit show. \n\nShe didn’t reveal too much, but Williams did share a few things about Arya’s journey to ITV’s This Morning , recently. She said, \n“This year it really kind of heats up, particularly for Arya, there’s some really high points… there’s some really low points, too.” \n\nvia GIPHY \nSeason 7 of GoT is set to begin airing later than previous seasons , premiering sometime toward the end of the summer. The HBO show is one of the most popular shows in the world and is often subject to casting and plot rumors making their way around the internet. \n\nvia GIPHY \nDespite the secrecy on set, the show has seen some major plot leaks and Williams is having none of it. She recently told the Radio Times how much the leaks irritate her. She said, \n“ It’s even more annoying when you know [the leaks] might be from someone on the inside, and it’s just like… you’re trying to make something really cool, that is really cool, and people really like, and it’s like. ‘stop ruining it.’ It’s such a childish, annoying thing to do. And yeah, it’s sad. It really annoys me.” \nWe totally agree with Maisie. We love Game of Thrones and can’t believe we’ll have to wait another six months for it to air, but we’re going to do our best to avoid all leaks! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:34:18.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
