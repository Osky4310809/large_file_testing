We always imagined every two years we would annihilate what came before and start over. And that’s what we’re doing now.” See More: ‘The Knick’: Cinemax Orders Script for Season 3 Premiere (EXCLUSIVE) \nSoderbergh says he wants the show to continue, and that the network is waiting to hear his plans for the future. “I would like to keep going. I always thought of it as a six-year thing if we were allowed to continue. I hope we can figure it out. I hope we come up with something that I look at it and go, OK, I want to spend another two years of my life on that. Because that’s really the question. It’s an intense experience — rewarding, but I want to make sure we want to keep the bar at the same height or higher.” \nAs for the show’s star, Clive Owen, Soderbergh says the door is open on his potential return to his show as well. “I don’t know yet,” says Soderbergh. “There’s been a lot of discussion about if we switch time periods can we still bring back the cast but have them play other people. Everything’s on the table.” \nThis fall “The Knick,” averaged about 450,000 in Nielsen’s “live plus-3” estimates.
