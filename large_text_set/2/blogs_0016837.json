She wanted to ensure that the 120 students who attend the school knew at least one person their first day of school, so she spent a month completing home visits at each of the students’ homes. \n“We’re not just about test prep and it’s not just about academics,” says Thomas, “we know that you can do great on assessments, but you can fail in college if you don’t know what it means to have perseverance and know how to advocate for yourself.” \nShe says she loves KIPP’s philosophy that schools much do everything they can to make students succeed. Thomas says she makes personal connections with children to understand who they are and where they are coming from to get a real world understanding of who each of the students are. In fact, Thomas makes sure she knows each of her students by name, as well as their favorite toy. She takes photos of each student with a graduation cap on and then tests herself with photos and flash cards. \n“Our kids are the hardest working kinds in the United States,” she says, “but they never bring it up.” \nEvery day, Thomas starts the morning by shaking students hands as they enter the building. She says she wants kids to know they can. \n“I show how much I believe in them, so they can believe in themselves the same way,” says Thomas.
