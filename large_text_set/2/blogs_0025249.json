(Photo: Liverpool FC) \nAnd when you take a look at these stats, it's clear to see why. \nWhen it comes to passing in the Premier League, NOBODY beats Jordan Henderson. \nHe's made a ridiculous 2,057 passes so far this season, a whopping 271 more than his nearest rival, Paul Pogba: Most passes in the Premier League \nThe rest of the top 10 is mostly made up of the type of player you'd expect - deep-lying midfielders responsible for spraying the ball around and getting it up the pitch, such as N'Golo Kante and Victor Wanyama. (Photo: Andrew Powell) \nWith that in mind, how does he shape up among his competition when it comes to getting the ball into the danger zone? \nAgain, the stats show the 26-year-old is head and shoulders above everyone else. (Photo: John Powell) \nOf his huge number of passes, 324 have been made into the final third of the pitch - which is 34 more than Pogba, who is again second to the Reds' skipper. Most passes into the final third in the Premier League \nFans of long-ball football - please take note of the third and fourth biggest passers in this particular list: Burnley keeper Tom Heaton and West Brom shot-stopper Ben Foster respectively. \nWho said long-ball was dead? (Photo: Alex Livesey) \nWith James Milner the only other Liverpool player to feature in either of this top 10s, it's easy to see why fans may be apprehensive going into games with their skipper. At least these numbers will give you something to be happy about, Jordan...
