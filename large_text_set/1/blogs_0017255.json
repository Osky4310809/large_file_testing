Some rolled large, metal trash cans at police.” \nIn all, 217 protesters were arrested in the District of Columbia on Friday. \nAlex Jones was on the scene and took firsthand accounts from several women who had sustained injuries from a group of Black Lives Matter protesters. \nImportant to note is while leftists attack Trump supporters over free speech, they are left alone to practice their free speech undisturbed. \nAll this unfolded as remarks from President Donald Trump’s inaugural speech called for unifying Americans of every race, color and creed under the banner of freedom. \n“It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots,” Trump stated. \n“We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag.” NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.
