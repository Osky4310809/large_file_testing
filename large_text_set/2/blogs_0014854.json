Essentially footwear designer Ben Kirschner fused the SFB Boot and the iconic Air Force 1 in the release, with the outcome being the perfect winter boot version of the court classic. The first design of the boot actually came with a Crepe sole. We hope that that version will actually see the light of day in the future. Metal eyelets and hooks have been added, a tongue pocket and the boldest design element is without any doubt the interwoven collar strap, which has an important function, while also being a fantastic design element.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:01:11.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
