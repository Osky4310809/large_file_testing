The Iraqi military has been carrying out almost 30 strikes a day on Mosul Credit: Sam Tarling / The Telegraph \nH ashem Abdullah said Isil had been using the house opposite his as a meeting place. Both the Iraqi and the US military’s rules of engagement mean they cannot strike a building until they can account for everyone in it. \n“The planes waited until one of the Daesh walked out into the street and then they struck. The fighter was only injured, but 11 members of one family in the house next door were instantly killed.” \nThe colossal destruction bore out their claims. Samood is a hellish landscape. Every third house seems to either bear the scars of a fierce firefight or is completely levelled. Burned-out husks of cars and the rubble from razed houses block most of the neighbourhood’s streets. \nOn the backseat of a yellow Kia, which was parked incongruously up against Mr Ahmed’s neighbour’s house, was an unexploded bomb about the size of a watermelon. Children went over to peer at it through the broken window, while one pretended to open the door to set it off before giggling and skipping away.

Thousands have fled these districts in recent days as fighting between the army and Isil intensifies, but many decided to stay - preferring to take the risk in their homes than live as refugees in one of the overcrowded camps on the city’s outskirts. \nThat anyone still lives in the ruins is a measure of how desperate the situation has become. The Iraqi army says it has carried out 3,780 sorties against Isil in northern Iraq since the offensive to liberate Mosul began, which averages out to almost 30 a day. The US, which is supporting Iraqi forces, has conducted more than double that. \n“They dropped leaflets over the city telling us not to worry about the strikes, saying that they were extremely precise and would not hurt the civilians,” says Mr Ahmed, 47. “Now it feels like the coalition is killing more people than Isil.” \nHe said he thought as many as 300 people had been killed in raids during the battle to liberate Samood and his late brother’s neighbourhood al-Mansour. It was difficult to immediately verify the claim. A recent report by Airwars , a UK-based organisation which monitors international air strikes against Isil, suggested as many as 370 civilian deaths could be attributed to coalition raids in the first week of March alone. \nMr Ahmed’s family had spent the last 10 days moving from house to house on Isil’s orders. He says their home was commandeered last Monday by a Chechen Isil fighter who was using it as a sniper position. The militants had spent weeks preparing for the army’s offensive to retake the western side of the city. \n“About a month ago, Daesh came to our house and gave me a drill,” the father-of-four said. “They drew a red square on my wall and gave me an hour to make a hole wide enough for them to climb through. Once I was finished I was ordered to pass it on to my neighbour and tell them to do the same.” \nWith coalition drones monitoring their every move from the skies, the jihadists have taken to moving between houses rather than out in the open where they can be targeted. Mr Ahmed pointed to the hole in the wall, which if you looked through it at the right angle you could see all the way down to the end of the street. \nHe said that by the end, 400 houses in the neighbourhood had holes driven right through them. Then, when the battle neared, the jihadists began laying down wrought iron bars over the length of the street in the hope of stalling the advancing Humvees.

He said the fighters had been a mixture of Iraqi, Syrian, Afghan and Chechen. The Chechens had the reputation of being the fiercest and were chosen either as fighters or specialist snipers. The rest were used as suicide bombers. \nM r Ahmed’s children delighted in showing us the body of one of the dead militants, which was missing most of its skull and had its legs twisted in an unnatural position. Still wrapped around his waist was an explosive belt, which had had its wires cut. \nThe army had ordered people to leave the body there, not to bury or cremate it or do anything that would pay it reverence. They said his nom de guerre was Abu Salah al-Iraqi and that he was the last Isil fighter to be killed in the Samood neighbourhood, marking the moment the residents knew they were free. \nLooking down at the rotting corpse, Mr Ahmed recalled something Abu Salah had said to him five days earlier. \n“The army and the Americans will destroy your neighbourhood, they will destroy everything in it just to get to us. They will turn Samood into Kobane [a northern Syrian town which suffered near-total destruction in the battle to oust Isil].” \nHe paused. “The only loser in this war is the civilians.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T08:18:53.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
