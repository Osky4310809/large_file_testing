Indeed, it feels like the campaign promises Trump is keeping have to do with cruelty and those he’s flip-flopping on have to do with character. \nBlow then called on liberals to reject Trump and his voters outright and not be open to compromise. \nThis is why I have no patience for liberal talk of reaching out to Trump voters. There is no more a compromise point with those who accept, promote and defend bigotry, misogyny and xenophobia than there is a designation of “almost pregnant.” \nTrump is a cancer on this country and resistance is the remedy. The Trump phenomenon is devoid of compassion, and we must be closed to compromise \nThe columnist ended his piece by telling liberals to “fight, fight, fight.” \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:13:17.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
