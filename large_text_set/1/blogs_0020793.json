Piers Morgan annoyed as Ewan Mcgregor refuses to show for GMB \nMorgan wrote: “Had we done the interview, I might have asked him how his heroic support for women justified him working for director Roman Polanski, a self-confessed and convicted child abuser, on the film, The Ghostwriter. \n“Polanksi pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl, then fled America to escape a lengthy prison sentence. \n“‘He’s a legendary filmmaker, one of the best,’ gushed McGregor in a 2010 interview about the pedophile, for whom Meryl Streep once gave a standing ovation at the Oscars.

I like him as a man.’” \nMcGregor has yet to respond to Morgan’s comments. Was going on Good Morning Britain, didn't realise @piersmorgan was host. Won't go on with him after his comments about #WomensMarch — Ewan McGregor (@mcgregor_ewan) January 24, 2017 \nMorgan said McGregor – who tweeted his refusal to take part in the interview – will now think he is “hugely popular”, but has in reality “anger[ed] and upset half [the] audience who don’t agree with [him]”. \nHe wrote: “As soon as McGregor posted his tweet this morning, social media erupted. The luvvie lemmings, naturally, all raced to offer him their support. But many other people didn’t, and questioned why if he felt this strongly he didn’t argue the issue with me on air rather than running away?
