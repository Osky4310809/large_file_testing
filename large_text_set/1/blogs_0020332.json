The $24 hats including a lossless DAC, a mini-amplifier, and a high-resolution audio output with COAX and optical audio out. \nIf you, like Neil Young, require the utmost fidelity in your music playback these three low-cost solutions should at least let you play back your lossless music files without much fuss. Obviously you can’t carry around a couple bare circuit boards so you can either buy or 3D print a case for your little semi-portable DAC unit. What would it take to turn this into a Pono ? Well, presumably you’d need a little power supply and LIPO battery , some kind of screen, and an input system to make it portable. If you wanted to remain at your desk you could could also use this screen-less kit . The whole thing requires a little bit of Raspberry Pi know-how as well, so be sure to keep on searching for that Ogg of gold. Basically this looks to be the start of a fun if complex DIY project but it may be worth it to hear Harvest Moon in its full 32-bit glory. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T18:08:30.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
