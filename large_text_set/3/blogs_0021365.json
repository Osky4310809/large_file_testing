Still, there are a few updates worth noting: The most interesting of these is probably the picture-in-picture in mode, which lets you watch videos while using other apps. There’s now a wide color gamut option for developers to better take advantage of the crazy good screens on our phones, including AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3, and more. Users can now snooze notifications so they reappear at a later time. Adaptive icons that can change shapes depending on the device (circle vs squircle, for instance), and even support visual effects for Android animations. Apps will be able to pin shortcuts for specific actions. E.g. an icon for navigating directly to your job that you can pin on your home screen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:15:28.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
