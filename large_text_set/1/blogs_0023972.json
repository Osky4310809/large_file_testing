Today, Dell also revealed plans to launch three new Chromebooks targeting schools, and one of them will also be a 2-in-1 convertible.\nSee also: How to run Android apps on your Chromebook July 14, 2016 The Dell Chromebook 11 Convertible will have a 6th-Generation Intel Celeron processor, but unlike the Acer and ASUS products, Dell’s 2-in-1 Chromebook will not have a stylus included, nor will it have a “world facing” camera when the display is moved into tablet mode. If you want those features, you will have to get the Windows 10 version of this Chromebook, the Latitude 11 Convertible. The Chromebook 11 Convertible model will be released on February 7 for $349, while the Windows 10-based Latitude 11 Convertible will be priced much higher at $579.\nDell’s other two upcoming Chromebooks will also launch on February 7. The Chromebook 11 , which has a display that can be laid flat 180 degrees on a table, will be priced starting at $219. The Chromebook 13 , which will have a normal notebook display, will be priced starting at $299. All three Chromebooks, along with their Windows 10 counterparts, are supposed to be made up to MIL-STD 810G specifications so they can be rugged enough to take a ton of abuse from students. All of them will have fully sealed keyboards and touchpads, so they can resist spills from a kid’s drink at lunch time.\nDell’s press release on these new products does not mention any support for running Android apps with these Chromebooks, although Google did recently say that all Chromebooks launching in 2017 would be able to support running Android apps via the Google Play Store. Hopefully, that will be the case for these new Dell models, although it is possible that support won’t be included out of the box but will be added later in an update.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T01:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T20:52:01.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
