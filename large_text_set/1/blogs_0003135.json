Sure; if you don’t have a conscience, you can certainly try it. But odds are that you will be exposed and fired, like former Olive Garden waiter Jason Kisner, who took their “When you’re here, you’re family” slogan a little too far.

The problem is that Kinser does not have cancer, which may suggest that he instead has a terminal case of being an asshole. \nOlive Garden did not confirm or deny whether Kisner was ill, but they did promptly fire him from the Southaven, Mississippi location. When MUNCHIES reached out for commentary, Olive Garden issued a statement saying that his actions were “inconsistent with our company’s values and he no longer works for us.” Some of those “inconsistent actions” allegedly included taking $125 from clients who truly believed that he needed the money to pay for cancer treatment. \nIn addition to firing Kisner, Olive Garden promised that they were “working to contact the guests and we will reimburse them for the $125 they gave the server.” \nIn the weeks and months leading up to his dismissal, witnesses also reported that Kisner had been heard bragging to coworkers about getting $100 tips and sighing loudly while telling clients about his supposed cancer treatment. Kisner also has a rap sheet that includes shoplifting and conspiracy to unlawfully possess a motor vehicle convictions. And while it’s not a criminal act in itself, he can now add preying on the generosity of others to that list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:24:21.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
