Kenji López-Alt and Kat Kinsman, who rise in defense of the ubiquitous, much-detested cheese product. \"It is my moral and ethical imperative to tell you that breakfast would be a lesser beast in the absence of American cheese,\" writes Kinsman . \"All cheese is processed,\" writes López-Alt —cheese only seems like a gift from god, he reasons, but in reality requires human intervention. American cheese is no different, so what's all the fuss about?\nRelated How to Make Creamiest, Dreamiest, Cheesiest Mac and Cheese Ever View article There are dissenters, of course. \"If cheese is 'milk's leap towards immortality,'\" objects one particularly fiery writer from the site Organic Authority, \"then pasteurized processed cheese product is milk's deal with the devil—a complete transformation into a shell of its former self, utterly stripped [of] soul and substance.\"\nLeaving aside this debate, I'd prefer to narrow our field of American-cheese inquiry to just three words: grilled cheese sandwich. That is why American cheese. Also burgers , I guess. The short-order cooks at Waffle House make a convincing case every time they serve up a bowl of cheese grits; I'm reliably informed, too, that at least one old woman in Italy finishes her pots of risotto with a slice of American cheese, because it \"brings it all together.\" And what else should New York City food-cart vendors put on a classic egg-and-cheese roll— gorgonzola ? GTFO.\nNot only is American cheese unique in its capacity for melting, it represents a proud history, created in the early 20th century as a way to use up scraps left over from the cheese-making process, or to repurpose cheese that was otherwise less than perfect. James L. Kraft's idea was to melt that rejected cheese down, add a stabilizer—and bang, Mssr. Kraft was bouncing down the road toward his eponymous Singles. His \"process cheese product,\" as it's now called, would come to be defined as \"a mild, meltable, and stable concoction of natural cheese bits mixed with emulsifying agents to make, in the law of the land, 'a homogeneous plastic mass.'\" (\"Plastic\" in the older adjectival sense, of course: \"capable of being molded or modeled.\" Not that this is great for American cheese's branding.)\nAnd that, friends, is the story of American cheese: one of wastelessness and ingenuity. It is not necessarily a story of great flavor, but flavor is sort of beside the point when it comes to American cheese—mostly it's about the meltability.\nUnless you make your American cheese at home, in which case you have access to a wide range of flavors. And it's shockingly easy.\nA quick spin in the food processor is just about all it takes.\nDespite their bad reputation, modern-day process cheese products generally come with an ingredient list that only a few brave heroes are willing to defend in public. (López-Alt, for instance, who published a piece last year listing and explaining all the typical components making up your slab of Velveeta.) Included in that list is \"sodium citrate,\" for instance, which sounds alarming but in truth is the crucial element that keeps process cheese from breaking or becoming greasy when it melts—and also lends its emulsifying muscles, Kenji points out, to such everyday foods as bratwurst, Italian sausage, and ice cream.\nUnless you're Nathan Myhrvold , though, it's not like you've got sodium citrate in your kitchen cupboard. What you may have, however, is gelatin —the key ingredient for homemade American cheese. When I started this project I dug through various other DIY recipes, which tend to call for ingredients that might not be immediately at hand: whole milk powder, for instance, or tapioca starch, or evaporated milk. Was this really necessary, though? Would it be possible to make American cheese at home that required no special ingredients, tasted delicious, and would melt beautifully?\nIt was, it does, and it would. (The inclusion of gelatin means the cheese is not vegetarian, of course, but bear in mind that some vegetarians regard a lot of cheese as not vegetarian, on account of the rennet .) In fact, the recipe is devilishly simple. It takes about 15 minutes.\nStart with a cheese that has a flavor you like . Colby is a traditional option, and will get you closest to the store-bought stuff, but any cheese that's not too hard (no Parmesan, for instance, or aged gouda) and shreds easily will work. Cheddar, if you like. Havarti. Monterey Jack. Whatever it is, shred it and place it in the bowl of a food processor .\nAll that's left to do now is heat some milk, throw some gelatin in it, and blend this all together into a smooth paste. And to find a mold: if you've got a cute butter mold in the shape of, I don't know, Flossie the Cow, now would be a fine time to use it. I had good luck simply lining a soup bowl with plastic wrap and pouring the cheese into that. True homemade American cheese pros will tell you that it's even possible to make singles: Line a rimmed baking pan with plastic, pour the cheese onto it, and use an offset spatula , or the back of a spoon, to spread it into a wide, even layer. After it's set, cut the cheese into squares and wrap them individually in plastic or wax paper.\nI did all this a few weeks ago and obviously, as soon as it was possible, heated a cast-iron pan over the stove and slathered mayo on two slices of good sourdough bread . I sandwiched a generous amount of my newly made American cheese between the bread, let it sizzle and crisp in the skillet a while, and then bit into my golden creation: the best grilled cheese sandwich I'd ever made.\nget this recipe", "external_links": ["http://www.npr.org/2016/05/08/477223936/how-best-to-eat-american-cheese-that-s-not-technically-cheese", "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/15/style/tmagazine/endofcuisine.html", "https://www.vegsoc.org/cheese", "http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/07/whats-really-in-american-cheese.html", "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plastic", "http://www.organicauthority.com/mojo-foods/american-cheese-neither-american-nor-cheese.html", "http://www.extracrispy.com/food/775/american-cheese-is-perfect", "http://mentalfloss.com/article/20537/brief-history-american-cheese-colonial-cheddar-kraft-singles"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:10:42.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
