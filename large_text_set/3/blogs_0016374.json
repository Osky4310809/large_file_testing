And as a slightly belated celebration of that momentous occasion, creators Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim have announced a big North American tour that a press release says will feature “a number of new spoofs and goofs, riffs and bits, songs and dances,” and a bunch of the other weirdo shenanigans that Heidecker and Wareheim have been getting up to over the last 10 years. \nYou can see an appropriately bizarre tour announcement video below, as well as a tour poster and the full list of dates, tickets for which go on sale on Friday. Also, the video notes that Heidecker and Wareheim have been making stuff together for a lot longer than 10 years ( Tom Goes To The Mayor was a lot of fun, right?), but “10th anniversary” just sounds really nice. \nTim and Eric 10 Year Anniversary Awesome Tour: \n7/11—State Theatre—Portland, ME \n7/12—Berklee Performance Center—Boston, MA \n7/14—The Town Hall—New York, NY \n7/18—Lincoln Theatre—Washington, DC \n7/20—Merriam Theater—Philadelphia, PA \n7/21—Vic Theatre—Chicago, IL \n7/23—Royal Oak Music Theatre—Royal Oak, MI \n7/25—Pabst Theater—Milwaukee, WI \n7/26—State Theatre—Minneapolis, MN \n7/28—Variety Playhouse—Atlanta, GA \n7/29—Paramount Theatre—Austin, TX \n7/31—Majestic Theatre—Dallas, T \n8/1—Paramount Threatre—Denver, CO \n8/2—The Warfield—San Francisco, CA \n8/4—Orpheum Theatre—Vancouver, BC \n8/5—Moore Theatre—Seattle, WA \n8/6—Revolution Hall—Portland, OR \n8/9—Theatre At The Ace Hotel—Los Angeles, CA (Image: AEG Presents)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:38:35.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
