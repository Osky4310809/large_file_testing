That's worked well recently.\n— Brian Grubb (@briancgrubb) March 15, 2017 \nBy the time she finally revealed two pages of Trump's 2005 tax return, she was scooped. The news was out there: Trump paid $38 million in taxes and earned $150 million that year. The White House had even put out a hrmmph of a statement before she got to the point. \nHer defenders say the wind up is typical Maddow, but newcomers thirsty for information about Trump's taxes were infuriated nonetheless. Then there's the legal argument. The White House statement said it was illegal for the show to release the return, Maddow countered with a nope.\nMaddow's long intro was probably guided by legal to establish the tax return's newsworthiness in anticipation of trump threatening to sue\n— TracieEganMorrissey (@TracieMorrissey) March 15, 2017 \nThe reporter on the story, Pulitzer Prize winning David Cay Johnston, also scooped Maddow with a story showing all the details that Maddow was about to reveal on The Daily Beast .\nEven the Wall Street Journal was able to get something out before Maddow got to her own hyped-up exclusive.\nWSJ just scooped Maddow 16 minutes into her show https://t.co/EBKHz0sjpk \n— Evan Siegfried (@evansiegfried) March 15, 2017 \nThe drawn-out reveal reminds us of the never-ending struggle to get Trump's tax returns in the first place. If this doesn't show how much pent-up demand there is for this info, we don't know what does. More than a million people have signed a petition demanding the president release all his tax returns. Countless protests , including some with bare bottoms, have been held.\nLeading up to Election Day, the New York Times leaked three pages from Trump's 1995 returns. Those reportedly showed that he lost $916 million that year. It further indicated that Trump may have not paid any income tax for almost 20 years, though totally legally. Although, he apparently did fork over money 10 years later.\nMaybe Trump's on that special every 10 years tax plan?\nWATCH: Behold, the Trump mask.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T04:30:11.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
