In which the company blamed the faulty batteries as the main cause of the battery explosions and overheating.\nAs reported by Hankyung, the refurbished Galaxy Note 7 units will feature a reduced capacity battery (3200mAh) compared to the original model (3500mAh) along with a new outer shell.\nAs per the report, most of the refurbished Note 7 units will likely sell in emerging markets like India and Vietnam as opposed to countries such as the US or European nations, where the device has been banned by multiple authorities.\nAs for when the company will launch the refurbished Note 7 phones in the market, the report says the company is planning to launch the devices “as early as June.”\nAccording to analysts, selling refurbished Galaxy Note 7 devices will not only help Samsung minimize losses it faced following multiple recalls and discontinuation, it will also help South Korean giant avoid environmental penalties it would have to pay to South Korean authorities for disposing of the inventory.\nIt should be noted that Samsung has not yet confirmed any of the details regarding its plan to launch the refurbished Galaxy Note 7 in the market, so do take this report with a pinch of salt as it is not confirmed news by the company itself.\nSource: Hankyung \nVia: The Investor \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:40:56.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
