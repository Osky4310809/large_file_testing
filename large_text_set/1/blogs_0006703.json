Fox News Slot by J.D. Durkin | 9:35 am, January 5th, 2017 THE TUCK RULE \nMatt Drudge of The Drudge Report broke the exclusive moments ago: Tucker Carlson will be moving into the 9 p.m. EST slot on Fox News, soon to be vacated by the outgoing Megyn Kelly . TUCKER CARLSON NEW CABLE KING… GETS 9 PM FOXNEWS https://t.co/pt0ayt53uD \n— MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) January 5, 2017 \nIn his report, Drudge calls Carlson — who returned to Fox News just a few months ago to serve in a full-time hosting capacity for Tucker Carlson Tonight — the new “Cable King.” \n2017 starts off with a BANG! as FOX NEWS executives will announce Tucker Carlson replaces the vacating Megyn Kelly at 9 PM ET, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned. \nThe dramatic move caps Carlson’s rapid rise at the nation’s top-rated cable channel. \nDrudge notes in his report that timing is “the only thing” in business, and Carlson’s return to the cable news airwaves came right at the start of the Trump presidency. \nMegyn Kelly announced earlier this week that she would be taking her talents to NBC in a new capacity, anchoring not only a daytime news show, but also a 60 Minutes style Sunday show as well as special events for the Peacock. \nThis information is breaking and we will update we we hear more. \nHave a tip we should know?
