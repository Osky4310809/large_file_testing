The Ex On The Beach cast dish the dirt to MirrorTV (Photo: Mirror Online) \nAnd it looked like the tensions which ran high in the villa are still causing runctions within the group, as we found out when we asked which word they associated with each other. \nSean told us that Maisie – who had her eye on him in the first episode – was a \"slag\" – and she reacted by bursting into laughter. \n\"Yeah, I'll take that, 100 percent take that,\" she said as the other girls gasped. Sean is put on the spot (Photo: Mirror Online) \n\"You know what? That's who I am, and I'm going to roll with it.\" \nAs Zahida and Harriette looked shocked, Sean explained why he'd used such an offensive term about his castmate. \n\"You're not a slag – basically, Maisie was very forward in the villa towards the guys,\" he revealed. Maisie doesn't seem at all bothered by the insult, telling her castmates, \"I'll take that\" (Photo: Mirror Online) \n\"I'm very open towards how I feel about sex and everything like that, and I think I shocked people with how forward I am,\" Maisie said. \n\"You're not a slag but you're very forward, but we'll high-five it out,\" replied Sean, doing exactly that. \nIt comes as the stars of the hit MTV show spill the beans on what went on in the villa. Sean looked embarrassed as his girlfriend Zahida covered her face in shock (Photo: Mirror Online)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T16:32:05.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
