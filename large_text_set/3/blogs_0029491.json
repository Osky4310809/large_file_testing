Then George [Gill, founder/original guitarist] fell down the stairs and broke his leg, and we kicked him out of his own band. When we played the Roxy again on 1 April, you wouldn’t have recognised the band that had previously been playing George’s songs , such as Bad Night at the Lion. \n12XU was one of our first songs as a four-piece. I wanted to deconstruct rock music, to make it sound like it came from somewhere else. So 12XU doesn’t have any chords in the verse, and the chorus doesn’t have any singing. The original lyric was: “Life’s a drag, give me a fag.” Not great, but Bruce [Gilbert, guitar] picked up on the word “fag” and used it as the American slang for gay. In those repressive times, it was a song about ambiguous sexuality that isn’t delivered like one. Someone in a dressing room asked me what the X stood for and I said, “What do you think?” We censored ourselves, but if it had been 1, 2, Fuck You, it would have cheapened it. It would have become Oi! So it’s actually very smart. There’s an arrogance when you’re young. Sitting in my bedroom in Watford, I definitely felt we were changing musical history. 2. I Am the Fly (1978) \nGraham Lewis (bass/vocals): There were few opportunities for punkish bands to get on TV, but when EMI told us about a new children’s show in the Midlands, which had a pop slot, we thought it would be dreadful. So nobody ever did anything about trying to get us on. Shortly afterwards, we played at Barbarella’s in Birmingham and it was rammed: sheer pogoing madness. During I Am the Fly, 20 people jumped on stage and the rest of the audience started lying down, waving their arms and legs in the air, like dying flies. It was a dada moment – the only time it ever happened – and back in London nobody believed us. When Tiswas became a national phenomenon and launched John Gorman, Chris Tarrant, Lenny Henry et al, we realised that the audience in Birmingham had been doing the “dying fly dance” from the programme – and that was the programme we could have been on. So we’d missed the boat. \nCN : The riff’s good. I find the chorus almost unlistenable now: too football terrace. I think the lyrics [“I am the fly in the ointment”] are Graham being a bit provocative. A bit, “We’re the annoying group who are going to ruin your day.” 3. Practice Makes Perfect (1978) \nCN: The beginning of Wire proper, which didn’t relate to rock history in the way [the debut album] Pink Flag did. I pissed myself laughing at Bruce’s lyric: “In my bedroom I’ve got Sarah Bernhardt’s hand.” For God’s sake, it’s sick! By this point I was obsessed with taking the “’n’roll” out of rock’n’roll and making it very precise, Germanic, taking out the swing. The der-der-der-da-der rhythm turns the first half of a common football clap into a riff. By the time I’d finished playing it to the band, they had joined in and the arrangement was complete. Rob [Grey AKA Gotobed, drums] had been surrounded by reggae in Brixton so he plays off me, a reggae groove with a rimshot. Graham is a melodic bass player and Bruce went for arpeggios. Those decisions were instant. It felt dark and mirrored the times. I knew that this was something nobody had heard before. With hindsight, you might say we’d invented post-punk. 4. Drill (1986) \nCN: When we reconvened after a five-year gap, Bruce had this Pol Pot idea of “year zero”. We wouldn’t play anything from the past and we’d try to write together in a room from nothing, which is not how we’d ever worked. The bassline is based on the same dugga-dugga rhythm as 12XU, but it grew into a pre-techno repetitive beat. Rob doesn’t use any cymbals: just a kick drum and hi-hat. Obviously the song’s significant because we called our festival Drill , but it set us on a course where we didn’t indulge nostalgia. When we played in Amsterdam, with no old material, there was a near-riot, but not relying on the past stood us in good stead. \nGL: When we toured in the States, our dear manager said, “If you fuckers are going to tour America and not play anything from the first three albums, you’re going to have to go over there beforehand and explain, because otherwise that’s all you will do all the time you’re there.” People thought we were crazy. Then we heard about this group, the Ex-Lion Tamers , who played Pink Flag, in order, with the exact gaps between tracks. So they supported us, wearing clothes like we wore in 1977. We had such a laugh. The NME reviewer said that the Ex-Lion Tamers had much better material than Wire. 5. Short Elevated Period (2017) \nCN: Wire ended in a big mess at the end of the 80s when Rob left. Rob returned, Bruce left and the bus ended up crashing off the cliff. Between 2004 and 2006, Wire didn’t exist at all. We were very cautious about replacing Bruce, then we auditioned Matt [Simms, guitar] and within 10 minutes realised we’d be idiots to let him go. This is the only fast track on our new album. Unusually, I followed Graham’s scheme with the lyrics to the letter. He wrote all the verses at the beginning and at the end wrote “In a short elevated period” with a “ch” next to it, so it’s a song that only has a chorus at the very end, a classic Wire deconstruction. \nGL: I had this phrase, “Indian queens paddle dug out canoes.” Ten minutes later, “Skippering a skiff in the typhoon season.” No idea where they came from, but everything seemed so vivid, a heightened feeling of elation. Once you get lines like that you get to the sound of the words, the feel, everything. \nCN: When it was played on BBC 6 Music’s Roundtable, the lady from the Guardian [Kate Mossman] said that she liked the way that Wire have never wallowed in their past. It’s very gratifying when people say our new stuff is as good as anything we’ve done . \n• Wire’s new album, Silver/Lead, is out on 31 March.
