Both are likely to be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chip , 4GB of RAM, and an improved 12-megapixel rear-facing camera. We’re also expecting iris scanners, water resistance, and possible S Pen compatibility .\nDespite their larger displays, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are said to have similar footprints as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. Samsung has achieved this by significantly reducing the size of the bezels around its displays, and doing away with a physical home button in favor of virtual, on-screen keys.\nET News also claims that one of the Galaxy S8’s biggest competitors, the LG G6, will go on sale on March 10. The new handset, which will boast a 5.7-inch display with a unique aspect ratio and a super wide-angle rear-facing camera , is scheduled to get its unveiling at Mobile World Congress this weekend .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:39:39.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
