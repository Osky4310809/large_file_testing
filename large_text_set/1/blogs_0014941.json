Colleton County High School/the Press and Standard Authorities say a break came in Mobley’s case late last year, after it had long gone cold, when investigators received a tip through the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.\nAfter contacting Mobley in Walterboro, where she was living under the name Alexis Manigo, police obtained a DNA sample from her that proved her real identity.\nOn Friday, Aiken was able to speak to her granddaughter on FaceTime, alleviating any fears she had about how she had fared all these years.\n“She looked good and she spoke good,” Aiken tells PEOPLE. “She graduated [from high school] and is doing good. I’m happy.”\n“I’m not mad at Gloria at all,” Aiken says.\n“She took care of my grandbaby,” she says.\nWhile Aiken is relieved that she and her family have been reunited with Mobley, she says she understands the difficulty the teen faces in processing the truth about her family .\n“My heart bleeds for her, because Gloria is the only mama my granddaughter knows,” Aiken says.\nMobley broke down in tears on Friday during Williams’ hearing at the Colleton County Jail in Walterboro, according to WJXT . Mobley told Williams she loved her after Williams blew her a kiss.\nWilliams remains in custody and was extradited to Jacksonville on Tuesday; it is unclear if she has retained an attorney.\n“I know it’s hurting her [Mobley], because I know she loves [Williams],” Aiken tells PEOPLE. “I know she’s going through some things right now because she learned to love those people.”\nShe says she doesn’t know whether Mobley will move to Jacksonville.\n“She has been in South Carolina for a long time, since she was taken from us when she was eight hours old,” Aiken says. “She’s got all of those friends and relatives she has accumulated over the years. I wouldn’t dare ask her to leave that behind.\n“The only thing I would tell her,” Aiken says, “is that she’s got to pray.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:47:50.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
