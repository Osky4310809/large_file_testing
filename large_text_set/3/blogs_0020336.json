For many of us the idea of running a marathon is a daunting one, but it’s still on the goals list for a lot of people. Goals go much beyond our ability to cross a marathon finish line.\nWe’re not all cut out to run a marathon, but the only way to know if you’ll finish is to get started. Taking those first steps - be it towards a marathon or towards your personal goals - is a major part of personal development. This year’s Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon brought 40,000 athletes together, who took their first steps towards a marathon success. Their grueling training hours finally paid off.\nWith the marathon Standard Chartered helped people take #OneStepCloser to their personal goals, and the company made efforts to improve local communities in response to the people of Mumbai taking their first steps towards making a change. People were asked to share a picture of their ‘first step’ towards a personal goal - one that they have found incredibly difficult to start. For every step shared Standard Chartered took steps for the betterment of society - sometimes in the form of a cleaner pavement or a smart bus-stop. The #OneStepCloser microsite provided a platform for those involved to check out the steps being taken by others and by Standard Chartered .\nYou can check out one of these many steps in action in this video:\nYou’ll never know just how difficult, long and testing the pathway to your goal could be unless you take that first step. You’re not alone on your journey though - everyone you meet is working towards something, including Standard Chartered. The #OneStepCloser campaign was Standard Chartered’s way of supporting the journey towards your personal goals, and those of the larger society. Creating opportunities for others and making improvements to the way of life for people in Mumbai may be a much larger task, but every step counts, and when we move together we make much more progress towards that finish line.\nYou can find out more about the steps Standard Chartered took to bring better education, travel and much more to Mumbai here .", "external_links": ["http://www.onestepcloser.co.in/", "http://onestepcloser.co.in/"], "published": "2017-03-22T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:25:31.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
