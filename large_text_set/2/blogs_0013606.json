The Roots’ Questlove also shared his love for the private Morrison, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 for his work with P-Funk. \nBorn in Dayton, Ohio, Morrison began playing piano in church at 5 years old, graduating as a teenager to gigs as a orchestra conductor and choir director due to his proficiency on drums, guitar, keyboards and brass, according to his official bio . After high school he started a stint with the Ohio Players, working as an arranger, producer and musical director for the band on such OP hits as “Pain,”“Funky Worm” and “Ecstasy.” He left the group in 1974 and became a key player in Clinton’s P-Funk from 1978-1980, contributing to such landmark albums as One Nation Under a Groove and Motor Booty Affair . \n[embedded content] \nMorrison was shouted out by Solange the day before the release of her Grammy-winning album A Seat at the Table , when she tweeted that he was the inspiration for the song “Junie,” which features the lyrics ‘You want to be the teacher/ Don’t want to go to school/ Don’t want to do the dishes/ Just want to eat the food.” In October, Morrison told Fader that he was blessed by the shout-out. \n“When she informed me about her song, I was a bit taken aback by the surprise but very appreciative that she wanted to put time and energy into creating it,” he said. “She indicated that she had written a song around my vibe and inspiration, and also indicated that it was very long and called, “Junie.” Suffice it to say, I was like, WHAAAT???!!!” Solange singing “Junie” on Instagram live pic.twitter.com/nsGThr6ziV \n—ㅤSolange Updates (@Solange_Daily) February 4, 2017 TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:43:30.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
