Southgate outlined his long-term plans to the England squad on Monday \n\"So, I think it was important for the players to have an understanding of what drives me, the type of standards that I think we have to set, what's possible but also the reality of where we are. \n\"That's not just this group of players, but as a country over the last few years. Southgate has won two and drawn two of his games in charge of England so far \n\"We have to change how we do things - we have to change the way we think, we have to change the way we work - because we have not had the same success that our opponents have had over such a consistent period of time. \n\"So, in that respect, they [Germany] are a great model for us to look at. We are not looking to copy anybody, but you have to respect the way they have continually reached semi-finals, finals and won things.
