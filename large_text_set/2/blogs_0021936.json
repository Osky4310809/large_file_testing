But there's a lot of misunderstanding about what exactly tapas means. It's generally understood that a tapa is small, but after that, confusion abounds. \nSee also: These are the Best Cities for Tapas in Spain Is 'tapas' plural or singular'? \nIn Spanish, you can have one 'tapa' and two or more 'tapas'. The word is undoubtedly plural. So why have I used it in the singular throughout this article? \nIn English, linguistically speaking, 'tapas' is used like 'a la carte'. The word 'tapas' in English is treated as a concept, always written with the 's'. I don't think it's used as a plural in English. If it were, my dictionary would include the word 'tapa', but it doesn't, and the 's' at the end of 'tapas' would be pronounced /z/ not /s/ (think how you pronounce the 's' in 'bananas' or 'zebras'). \nSo when you're in Spain, feel free to say 'I'm not very hungry, I think I'll get one tapa', because that is how it would be used in Spanish. \ncontinue reading below our video America's Best Foodie Cities But, in the English language it's fine to use the word 'tapas' as a singular word. \nThere are a number of myths about what tapas is all about.

As long as it is small and served with your drink (either free or at a surcharge), it is tapas.

If you start eating tapas , you finish eating tapas, and you don't stop until you're full. Tapas is not a collection of small dishes brought out on a platter and eaten as a main course . The Spanish have a word for this - ' tabla '. The Meaning of the Word Tapas \nA ' tapa ' is a 'lid' or 'cover'. In the early days of tapas, a slice of cheese or ham was given with your drink and placed over your drink. There is some debate over why exactly this was done: To keep out the flies. To hide the smell of the bad wine. To keep the wind from blowing your drink everywhere. \nI prefer the first explanation - a piece of ham will only hide the smell of the wine until you take it off to take a drink, while if there was a strong wind, surely the first thing to go flying would be the tapas! \nThere is another explanation which differs from the above. It is said that there was once a sick king - which one exactly differs according to who is telling the story - who couldn't drink alcohol without taking some food with it. He issued a royal decree that insisted that everyone should take food with their drinks. A slight variation of this one is that the benevolent king simply insisted that food should be taken with any drink out of concerns for the health issues associated with drinking on an empty stomach. \nSee also: 11 Things the Spanish Claim They Invented Tapas in Spain Today \nSo, with all the myths about tapas out of the way, this is what tapas is today.
