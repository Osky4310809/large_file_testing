links in Rumour Mill! \nWENGER STILL UNDECIDED AS PSG CIRCLE \nWenger said he’s made a decision on his Arsenal future following the 3-1 loss to West Brom, but according to The Evening Standard, the Frenchman is still undecided. \nThe 67-year-old will reportedly use the international break to come to a conclusion, even after West Brom manager Tony Pulis said Wenger told him he’s not leaving Arsenal. \nThe Telegraph reported the Gunners manager wants to make a final attempt at ending his Arsenal career on a high by revamping his squad in the summer, with Wenger set to be offered a new two-year contract, according to The Mirror.

Source: AFP \nHowever, Wenger’s decision to stay or leave could be influenced by the lure of another top coaching role. \nParis Saint-Germain have offered Wenger a two-year deal to become the manager of the French champions in the summer, according to The Sun. \nPSG chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi reportedly believes the Gunners boss can take the Ligue 1 club to new heights after a disappointing season under Unai Emery, where they were eliminated by Barcelona in the Champions League Round 16 with a humiliating 6-1 second leg defeat (6-5 on aggregate).

Arsenal also reportedly believe they could lure Dembele to London. Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette, centre right.

Source: AFP \nHowever, The Mail reported Tottenham are leading the race to sign the 23-year-old midfielder with his contract set to expire after next season. \nArsenal has also made contact with the agent of Schalke ace Leon Goertzka over a potential transfer, according to Bild. \nThe 22-year-old versatile midfielder has six goals, two assists and 28 chances created in all competitions this season. Pressure circles on Wenger 1:47 \nDEFENSIVE DOUBTS \nThe futures of fullbacks Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs is reportedly in doubt with Wenger wanting to overhaul the position. \nGibbs has one year left on his contract, and the club has been monitoring Celtic left-back Kiernan Tierney and Valencia’s Jose Gaya (though Manchester City are reportedly leading the chase.)
