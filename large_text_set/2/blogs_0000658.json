In 2017, Muir’s Sydney-shot sequel, Urban Burqa, is released in a drastically changed world: new US president Donald Trump has introduced a US travel ban affecting predominantly Muslim countries; 49% of Australians say Muslim immigration should be stopped ; and the refugee crisis in Europe continues unabated. The world has changed but, says Muir, the intent of this series remains the same as its predecessor’s: ‘to protest against blanket judgments based on beliefs, origin or appearance’ Fabian Muir Wednesday 1 February 2017 00.34 GMT Fabian Muir: ‘A few people in 2014 had a knee-jerk reaction to the very sight of a burqa and incorrectly assumed that my first series favoured forcing women to wear one. It was simply an allegorical device referencing immigration, rising populism, empathy and assimilation.’ Photograph: Fabian Muir ‘This sequel’s aims are no different. Significantly different, however, are today’s parameters. Whereas Blue Burqa addressed only Australian issues, the sequel finds itself confronted by drastically changed global conditions: a not-always-united Europe grappling with an unprecedented crisis as it tries to assimilate refugees; a surge in extreme rightwing movements in traditionally tolerant societies; an Australia where 49% of the population would like to put a halt to Muslim immigration.’ Photograph: Fabian Muir ‘Meanwhile, President Trump has already imposed a comprehensive travel ban upon selected Muslim nations with the stroke of his pen.’ Photograph: Fabian Muir ‘Bringing the burqa in this series into sometimes confronting or disorienting urban environments seeks to reflect this world and encourage greater understanding.’ Photograph: Fabian Muir ‘President Trump’s sordid attempt to thrust anti-Muslim sentiment onto the mainstream agenda under the guise of homeland security suggests a jingoistic, reckless desire to generate paranoia and provoke a so-called clash of civilisations based on nationality and belief.’ Photograph: Fabian Muir ‘Some of the current news footage is already beginning to resemble the sort of dystopian vision that was previously the domain of novels.’ Photograph: Fabian Muir ‘These developments raise a great many questions. Why does the mere fact that someone was born in a certain country or hold dual citizenship automatically make them a suspected terrorist? While other major western governments oppose the ban, why does the Australian government remain largely compliant? How could any conscientious person criticise Angela Merkel’s exemplary and humanitarian approach to the refugee crisis as a “catastrophic mistake ”?’ Photograph: Fabian Muir ‘How can 49% of Australians be so devoid of empathy and understanding, vilifying refugees who leave their own homes to escape horrific circumstances — in some cases caused by western intervention — as if this were a criminal act? What has happened to the presumption of innocence, a fundament of any functioning justice system?’ Photograph: Fabian Muir ‘We are facing issues that go to the heart of our humanity and the very nature of western democracy. How thinking people and governments now respond will be crucial in defining who we really are.’ Photograph: Fabian Muir ‘Despite everything, I remain optimistic and Urban Burqa is intended as a small part of that response.’ Photograph: Fabian Muir", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:49:08.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
