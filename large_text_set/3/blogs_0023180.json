Barkley said that if he ever was coming close to death because of an incurable sickness, or should we say a disease that is “turrminal, just turrminal,” that he would fight and kill Skip Bayless on live national television. \nFrom The Dime :\nBarkley: “You know what we should do for ratings? If I get a disease and I’m gonna die, how about you get Skip Bayless in here and I’ll kill him live on national television.”\nPatrick: “I like it. Like pay-per-view.”\nBarkley: “No, no, no. Just get him in here. Only when I know Imma die….Cause I just want to get Skip Bayless in a room one time and beat him like a dog.”\nPatrick: “So you’d kill him.”\nBarkley: “Yes. Only if I knew I was gonna die. Not if I’m gonna live, cause I don’t wanna go to prison. Cause like Mahorn say, ‘they would love you in prison.’”\nCan someone contact Barkley’s doctor to play an innocent practical joke on Sir Charles with a dire health prognosis? \nOther highlights from the interview:\nBarkley said he only smoked weed five times in his life. He didn’t love the experience because all it did was make him want to eat potato chips. He also told the story of how he was hosting “Saturday Night Live” and the musical guest was Nirvana. While Chuck was in his dressing room, he got contact high because a “big mushroom cloud” escaped their room every time the door was open. \n\n\nCharles also discussed Lavar Ball, and even said he would probably take Ball #1 in the NBA Draft, but would also consider Josh Jackson to be the best college basketball player. \n\nCharles said that legendary Detroit Pistons coach Chuck Daily told Barkley that he was the second best basketball player he’s seen after Michael Jordan. \n\n\nSir Charles also talked about betting on golf against Michael Jordan. \n\nHere is the entire Barkley interview with Dan Patrick. \n\n[ ExtraMustard ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:40:54.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
