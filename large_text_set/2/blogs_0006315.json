It was an album of straightforward guitar ragers that imagined punk and glam and psych and Sabbath-era metal as one big sludgy genre unto itself, and it marked bandleader Chad Ubovich as a worthy peer of collaborators Ty Segall and Mikal Cronin. \nNow the self-described “weirdo band”— though the tastiest fruit of their self-analysis is “metal on molly” by far — is back with ALICE , an album that colorfully expands on the Meatbodies template. A concept album that plays like Ziggy Stardust as reimagined by Queens Of The Stone Age, it finds this band continuing to hit hard while burrowing deeper into psych and glam in service of what they’re calling “a near fable of fear, sexuality, war, religion, technology, peace, philosophy, hedonism, sociology, evolution, and ecclesiasticism.” It’s rad, so stream the whole thing below a day before its official release. \nALICE is out 2/10 on In The Red.
