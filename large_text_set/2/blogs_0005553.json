Lady Gaga is preparing for her main event , too.\nOn Sunday, the “Joanne” singer graced the field at Houston’s NRG stadium, prancing around and posing in an asymmetrical black skirt and cropped black sweater. And while cleats are probably the most appropriate footwear, Gaga opted for stilettos.\nShe also shared a shot of her pre-game field moment on Twitter , explaining that her sister missed out on the fun because she was busy “sewing costumes” backstage.\nThe 30-year-old singer has been documenting her journey to the Super Bowl LI halftime show from rehearsals to messing around on the field, and the action has continued in the hours leading up to her performance.\nOther behind-the-scenes moments included her waking up on Sunday morning and getting her hair and makeup done.\n“Hey Little Monsters, it’s me. I’m getting ready to go to the venue to play the halftime show. So excited!” she said in one video posted on Snapchat.\nWe're missing my sister cuz she in the back sewing costumes! #FamilyMatters #PepsiHalftime #SB51 pic.twitter.com/akOGvOmqHZ \n— xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) February 5, 2017 \n\nRELATED VIDEO: Could Beyoncé Be Hitting the Super Bowl?

The thing is, it’s such a big world stage in terms of how many people see it and it’s been done so many times.”\nWhat do you think of Gaga’s pre-show getup? Sound off below!
