He decided to make the film after a gay friend mentioned to him that he had a “hot hookup” at a Korean spa. \n“That’s really where the film started: this intersection of my gay and Korean identities at the spa,” Ahn told me in an interview last year before his film premiered at Sundance. \nDuring his acceptance speech, Ahn told the room full of filmmakers that it is important they tell stories “about immigrants , about Muslims , women, people of color, trans , and queer folk.” \n“Film is such a powerful tool in humanizing these communities so that we can’t be pushed aside [and] labeled as other, we are part of this great country, and we are undeniable,” Ahn said. \nAhn was awarded the John Cassavetes Award, a prize that goes to films with budgets under $500,000. Previous winners include director Ava DuVernay’s 2012 film Middle Of Nowhere and filmmaker Dee Rees’ 2011 film Pariah . \nSpa Night , Ahn said, was able to be made in part because of the several grants he applied for and a successful Kickstarter campaign, which raised close to $63,000. \nHe ended his speech at the awards ceremony by thanking his parents. \n“Finally, I have to thank my parents for understanding that their gay Korean-American son is their son,” he said.
