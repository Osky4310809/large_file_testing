LUCIE, Fla. — David Wright , the 34-year-old Mets third baseman struggling to salvage his career after various back and neck injuries, is now facing a related shoulder ailment. Wright was found to have an impingement of his right shoulder, General Manager Sandy Alderson said on Tuesday, and was sent back to New York for further examination. Alderson said that Wright had been experiencing soreness all spring, but that the injury did not require surgery. He said Wright would stop throwing a baseball for about two weeks and then gradually resume a gentle throwing program until he built up strength. That makes it unlikely that Wright will be on the Mets’ opening-day roster, but there are more long-term implications for his hope of returning as an everyday player and playing through the rest of his contract, which runs through 2020. “I don’t think we are at that point, the point where that concern is at a heightened level,” Alderson said about the possibility that Wright’s career could be in jeopardy. “This is all part of the process of rehabilitating from the neck surgery. It’s taking longer than I’m sure David would have hoped and we would have hoped. But it’s part of the process.” Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.
