Rep. Says Berkeley Riot, Beating, Pepper-Spraying of Trump Fans Was “Beautiful Sight” \nFeinstein said she would give Gorsuch a fair hearing before that body and see if he was a “mainstream” jurist, although she declined to pin down exactly what being “mainstream” entails. \n“I view the minority party’s challenge is to do a full and fair hearing and to have time to garner the facts to really understand the history of this nominee,” Feinstein told Fox News. “And we will do that.” Video below:   \nFeinstein surprisingly sounds more moderate than Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkeley of Oregon and Ron Wyden of Oregon. They, according to The Daily Caller , were among the Democrats who have pledged to filibuster Gorsuch no matter what kind of testimony he gives. \nIn fact, had Trump decided to reanimate Oliver Wendell Holmes or John Jay and nominate them to the court, these Democrats still would have filibustered. Such is the rage of the Democrat Party. \nPerhaps most stinging about Feinstein’s apparent rejection of the outright filibuster is that she seemed to be the leader of Democrat opposition to Trump’s pick. \n“Many of us haven’t recovered” from Judge Merrick Garland’s rejection by Senate Republicans , Feinstein said last week, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . “So I think the appropriate thing is to take our time considering this nominee. The court’s not going to fall apart. It’s going to be just fine.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:14:31.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
