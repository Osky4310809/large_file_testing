It would remove a burden of so many people that they can stand out in the light and say, now I am free to contribute to America as I know I can. And that's what people want.\" Watch | Donald Trump reins in his dominant handshake 00:15 \nM r Kenny also urged Trump to consider providing more work visas \"for young people who want to come to America and to work here\". \nSome estimates put the Irish natives living in the country illegally in the tens of thousands. Mr Kenny has made a similar pitch on immigration in the past, but the current US administration's position on illegal immigration has heightened the underlying tension . \nMr Trump ran on a promise to curtail illegal immigration. His revised travel ban , affecting travellers from six Muslim-majority nations, was set to go effect on Thursday before it was put on hold on Wednesday by a federal judge in Hawaii. \nM r Kenny's tone was much more convivial than when he spoke in the Irish parliament in June last year, describing the then presidential candidate's rhetoric as \"racist and dangerous.\" Timeline | Donald Trumps travel ban \nM r Trump supported the British vote to leave the 28-country bloc - known as Brexit - saying earlier this year that it would \"end up being a great thing.\" \nThe US president welcomed Mr Kenny to the White House, proclaiming his love for Ireland. At the luncheon, he called Mr Kenny a \"new friend\" and quoted an Irish proverb to remember friends that \"have stuck by you.\" Mr Trump added, \"Politically speaking, a lot of us know that.\" \nDuring the evening St. Patrick's Day reception, Mr Trump hailed the relationship between the two countries and pledged to be \"an ever-faithful partner and an always loyal friend.\" The bowl of shamrocks presented to Donald Trump Credit: EPA \nM r Kenny was the first EU politician to meet with Mr Trump after Prime Minister Theresa May. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was scheduled to come to the White House on Tuesday, but that visit was moved back to Friday because of the snow. \nThe St. Patrick's Day event at the White House dates back to the 1950s and has become an important standing engagement for Ireland, which has strong emotional and ancestral ties to the United States. \nS peaking after Mr Trump at the luncheon, Mr Kenny joked: \"They say the Irish have the capacity to change everything. I just saw the president of the United States read from his script ... entirely.\" \nBut Mr Kenny was also complimentary. \n\"Let me congratulate you, President Trump, on your election,\" he said. \"You beat them all.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:33:58.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
