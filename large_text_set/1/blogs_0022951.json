I think that we grew a lot,\" Conte added. \n\"After the game (against Liverpool) I said 'today we faced a great team, a really great team, but today we are not a team. Only through work we can improve to become a team'. I think it happened. \n\"We grew a lot and for this reason now we are top of the table. \n\"It's incredible this, because it's not easy to have two defeats against Liverpool and Arsenal and to find the strength to start and to arrive top of the table and to have 13 wins in a row.\" \nConte described the fact the match was taking place on the evening the January transfer window closes as \"very strange\". Asmir Begovic will only leave if Chelsea find a replacement (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Read More Chelsea boss Antonio Conte warns goalkeeper Asmir Begovic he will not leave unless a replacement is found \nFor now, at least, defender Branislav Ivanovic and goalkeeper Asmir Begovic are in the squad, with Conte reporting no injuries ahead of Monday afternoon's training session. \nIvanovic's nine-year stay at Chelsea could be nearing an end with Zenit St Petersburg a rumoured destination, while Begovic will be allowed to join Bournemouth if the Blues can find a suitable replacement. \nIvanovic scored his 34th Chelsea goal on his 377th appearance against Brentford last Saturday, but has fallen down the pecking order since the beginning of the season. \nConte said: \"Ivan played a lot of games for this club. He won a lot for this club. \n\"He's 32 and I think he can play for many years and is able to continue his career in the right way and (at a) top level. \n\"It's important also to respect the decision of the player.
