But, one of the things that has been a bright light in this fairly dark world is the number of Indian and international celebrities who are all set to become mothers this year. While, yes, this has nothing to do with us, but we can't help but be excited about this new chapter in their lives. From Lisa Haydon to Beyonce, here are five beautiful ladies set to become mothers this year. Lisa Haydon \nIn an unexpected turn of events, model and actress Lisa Haydon announced that she was expecting her first child with husband, Dino Lalvani, in January. And she's been spending her pregnancy the best way possible, by the beach.

And she now looks even better (also, that's going to be one hell of a good-looking kid!). A post shared by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (@rosiehw) on Feb 27, 2017 at 6:48pm PST Beyonce \nQueen B broke the Internet when she released her gorgeous pregnancy photo-shoot pictures, announcing that she is expecting twins with husband Jay-Z. We cannot wait to see Blue Ivy with her mini-mes. A post shared by Beyonc√© (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST Nisha Rawal \nTelevision actress and model Nisha, and her actor husband Karan Mehra, are all set to become parents for the first time, this year.
