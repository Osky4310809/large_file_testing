Anytime they will back up a non catch against Dez…. Sure! Of course they would. The Stripes got something against the Cowboys! Kim Jong Goodell says: Jan 19, 2017 2:56 PM \nMy biggest concern with the cowboys in the post season was that their catching staff undoubtedly step on their own junk and cost them the game. I feel like the cowboys performance validates that concern. Jan 19, 2017 2:59 PM \nBut but but that’s why the cowboys lost! Those refs! Jan 19, 2017 2:59 PM \nAnd cue the trolls………… TheDPR says: Jan 19, 2017 3:02 PM \nHow would ANYbody know whether Dallas was being deceptive or not other than the guy who sent Butler into the game and then called him back out? Football penalties aren’t called based on motive. The official can only see what actually happened and what happened was against the rules. \nOfficials often cut guys slack when they run halfway to the huddle and then are called back to the sidelines. Butler was IN the huddle and then not. Penalty. Should be zero controversy here. cboys4life2014 says: Jan 19, 2017 3:17 PM \nAlthough this call probably didn’t affect the outcome, unless you consider Dallas could’ve had 3 or 7 more points which yes would’ve changed the outcome, Brice Butler was never in the huddle as the huddle wasn’t yet formed and therefore no play was being called. Everybody waiting to form the huddle was waiting on correct personnel. maverick2560 says: Jan 19, 2017 3:27 PM \nI thought if a team makes a substitution that allows the other team to substitute as well. How many times have I seen a ref stand over ball to allow the defense to substitute. This occurs even in the last two minutes of a game. Isn’t that to prevent deception? If so why wasn’t that doe here? Another question I have is that Prescott appeared to be standing away ( about 5 yards ) after the Cowboys confusion was over …the huddle seemed to be set…then a few seconds later, Prescott went in to the huddle and called the play. Isn’t that the correct procedure? russrpm says: Jan 19, 2017 3:27 PM \nThe comments from the league are exactly what they trotted out about the “Tuck rule.”“It’s been on the books forever.”“See, we’ve called it before.”“No, it’s not obscure.” By the way, does anyone know what the definition of a huddle is? ggagne66 says: Jan 19, 2017 3:33 PM \nI don’t really see any Cowboys fans saying this cost them the game. I do believe it was a bad call simply because it appeared to me that the huddle hadn’t formed yet. But regardless, the secondary’s inability to cover cost them the game. cletis4ever says: Jan 19, 2017 3:34 PM \nI’ve watched football for over 20 years, NEVER seen that penalty called before. That doesn’t change the fact that it’s in the rulebook, but man what a terrible time for that to happen. \nThat being said, look at the pictures (or video) online. It’s out there. The offense was loosely grouped, spread out almost into their positions BEFORE they “huddled” when Butler arrived, was presumably signaled from the sideline, and presumably left. The offense was in NO WAY in a “huddle” (which is specifically referenced in the rule). \nOk, let’s leave that behind and say it WAS a penalty as called. 15 yards?? The same as when you put your hands on an official, throw a punch at a player, or grab a facemask and try to rip a guys head off? Really??? \nNot gonna blame the refs for losing…….but taking a MINIMUM of 3 points off the board (they would have been in the red zone, WELL within field goal range) in a 34-31 game? Well, that hurts. Kim Jong Goodell says: Jan 19, 2017 3:35 PM \nSomewhere Harbaugh can be seen muttering “it’s deception..” as he gathers his offensive coaching staff to design a few versions of this that they can use for themselves… lionsandvikingsandbearsohmy says: Jan 19, 2017 3:35 PM \nNot the smartest players, not the smartest coaches, not the smartest fans but MAN are there a lot of em. lionsandvikingsandbearsohmy says: Jan 19, 2017 3:38 PM \nYou Cowboys fans should try accepting the fact your team got beat by the other team sometime. It’s more dignified than whining about the refs, or saying your team/coaches “lost the game for us”. tripledipper says: Jan 19, 2017 3:38 PM \nIt was called correctly. But its a horrid rule. At worst make it delay of game. tritz32 says: Jan 19, 2017 3:45 PM \nMy favorite part of the game Dallas trying to sub in players on defense against Rodgers on that first series! Solid, solid coaching there Jason! shaggytoodle says: Jan 19, 2017 3:46 PM \nWhat I beleive happened was Dallas had scripted the first 15 plays. There was a misunderstanding between coaches and Butler causing him to go in one play early. \nIf that was allowed teams would send in goal line packages watch the defense Sub in their bigs and swap out the the goal line package out with WRS to create mismatches. Jan 19, 2017 3:47 PM \nLose the game, blame the rules. pacificdan says: Jan 19, 2017 4:00 PM \nThe Cowboys lost that game because; 1. They moved away from the run in the first half. 2. Aaron Rodgers is on FIRE. \nNot necessarily in that order. \n-Cowboys Fan. dcapettini says: Jan 19, 2017 4:01 PM \nIs there anything that happens that the Cowboys and their fans don’t whine about? It’s a rule and a good rule and one that has been around a long time. What is the issue, other than an excuse for losing? vikings2102 says: Jan 19, 2017 4:06 PM \nNot a Dallas fan, hate the Packers, but the NFL is wrong on this one (weird). \nEvery team, every game, every year does the same thing that Butler did. Go out towards the field and near the huddle and get’s called back to the sidelines since he’s not supposed to be there. The call was garbage. \nNow, if Butler was in the huddle while they called the play and then he left for someone different, fine call the penalty. Yet another outdated rule (from 1955, really?!) that needs to be scrapped from the 4 Billion page NFL rule book that no one understands….including the zebra’s that are supposed to enforce them. russrpm says: Jan 19, 2017 4:06 PM \nWith the NFL network replaying games over and over again, how long will it take fans to pinpoint dozens of plays where this occurred and was not called. I see Blandino’s twitter account being blown up one more time. iejdaniel says: Jan 19, 2017 4:09 PM \nYet no call on the play where Sharon had her chinstrap undone. A flag would have resulted in a reply, as they actually threw a hanky on the Dallas D. jimnaizeeum says: Jan 19, 2017 4:10 PM \nYou would think the “coach of the year” would know the rules a bit better. clonefan says: Jan 19, 2017 4:17 PM \nI must not have seen the definitive replay. What I remember the network showing, was him walking near where the huddle was going to be and then leaving, but the huddle didn’t even take place until he left. Did the network not show the right thing? youafool says: Jan 19, 2017 4:21 PM \nHe was never in the huddle….he was standing outside of it the entire time as he wasn’t entirely sure that he should be out there. It was a gross overreaction by the refs. Didn’t cost us the game…..the non-holding call on David Irving being tackled to the ground did. ncfloyd says: Jan 19, 2017 4:25 PM \nDidn’t Bill Walsh pull this stunt. Lineup 12 guys, send one in motion right out of bounds before the snap. You can bet Belicheat would try this if is wasn’t in the books. akira1971 says: Jan 19, 2017 4:29 PM \nYup, just looked it up. Happened late October 2014 with Redskins against Garrett’s Cowboys. Logan Paulsen ran into the huddle and then straight to the sidelines. Knocked the ‘Skins out of FG position. Jan 19, 2017 4:31 PM \nthey mean it produced its intended results. \n2 penalties on the packers all game. the packers OL gets to jump on the backs of defenders and tackle them to the ground. \nhave fun with that Atlanta. bocadiver1 says: Jan 19, 2017 4:34 PM \nYou got it right, DPR, and so did the league (for once). But it makes all the Goodell/refs/Mara/Rooney/Jones/etc. haters have something to mindlessly mumble about. vikesfan320 says: Jan 19, 2017 4:46 PM \nSo accidentally running into a huddle and then back out because you were part of the wrong personnel grouping is 15 yards, and sprinting as fast as you can, leading with the crown of the helmet, and launching yourself at the head of an unsuspecting receiver is also 15 yards. \nJust because the penalty was called and enforced correctly doesn’t mean the penalty is not ridiculous. frederickband says: Jan 19, 2017 4:47 PM \nThere were players there, but a huddle it was not. Butler was looking towards the sideline the whole time, and was there for a second before he ran back, obviously unsure if he was supposed to be there or not. The huddle had not yet commenced. pacificdan says: Jan 19, 2017 4:51 PM \nI haven’t seen a single person on here, Cowboys fan or otherwise, saying that flag cost Dallas the game. Some of you posters are just making stuff up. \nWhat seems to be happening here is a group of logical fans, some for, some against, having a reasonable conversation about the merits of if the flag should have been called and if 15 yards is fair. \nAnd then there are the trolls saying, Cowboys fans are blaming the refs. All we need now is 700levelvet to show up and spill his BS and the thread will be complete. teal379 says: Jan 19, 2017 5:03 PM \nEveryone saying “I’ve never seen this happen!!!” yet gloss right over the parts in the article where the COWBOYS played in a game with Garrett as coach just 2 years ago where it happened. \nBut hey – you’re the biggest Cowboy fan ever, been watching since Landry and you’ve never seen it…..
