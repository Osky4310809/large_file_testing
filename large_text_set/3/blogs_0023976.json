Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., following the meeting. He said the House Freedom Caucus will “go back and consider our options” with the bill. Advertisement - story continues below \nRep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., told The Hill that the president was “very gracious” during their meeting, but “no firm decision” was made by those who attended the White House meeting. \n“He asked us to seriously consider the position we are in,” Duncan said. \nTrump urged his supporters on Twitter to contact their representative in support of the plan.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2017 \nHowever, public support for the current version of the GOP replacement bill looks bleak. \nOnly 17 percent of voters support the Republican plan, with 56 percent opposing it, according to a Quinnipiac Poll released Thursday. \nSupport among House Republicans appears to be waning as well, with the party short of the 215 votes needed to send the bill to the Senate. The House is scheduled to vote on the Obamacare repeal-and-replace plan Thursday, but unless something drastic changes in the 11th hour, many lawmakers believe the vote will be delayed until Friday .

The more they placate to the conservative wing of the party, the more support they risk losing from moderate Republicans. \nConservatives refusing to back the current version of the bill say it does not do enough to rescind Obamacare regulations. They’re pushing the White House to end the mandate that requires all health insurance policies to cover “essential health benefits.” \nModerate Republicans are worried that more aggressive changes to the bill will negatively impact their constituents, leading them to question if it would be better for their constituents to stay on Obamacare. \nRep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., criticized Republicans for moving too fast with their replacement bill, and urged them to slow down. \n“This healthcare repeal affects millions upon millions upon millions of Americans,” McGovern said. “Don’t jam a disastrous bill through the House with patched-up fixes.” \nRep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., is under no false illusion that his party has been put in a tough spot with repealing Obamacare. He offered praise for the president and House leadership for their handling of the situation. \n“One tragedy of all of this is that Obamacare was put into place by all Democrats and now Republicans, in trying our best to alleviate the tragedy and save the country are going to have to take a lot of the punishment,” Franks said.
