After having a strong debut in the U.S. and other international box offices, Doctor Strange ’s total global gross has pushed the movie above one of DC Film’s most lucrative hits. \nWith Doctor Strange raking in $2.1 million this week, the Marvel movie has now earned $669.7 million total. That number has now helped Doctor Strange overcome the total global grossing of Man of Steel which raked in $668 million during its cumulative run. Doctor Strange now sits as the sixth highest-grossing comic book superhero origin film worldwide. However, it seems unlikely that Doctor Strange will overcome its next competitor, Suicide Squad . The controversial super-villain flick debuted last year and earned more than $745 million despite it being barred from China. \nFrom Marvel comes DOCTOR STRANGE, the story of world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place – a mysterious enclave known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a center for healing but also the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange – armed with newly acquired magical powers – is forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence. Join Strange on his dangerous, mystifying, and totally mind-bending journey. \nThe cast features Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock, Star Into Darkness, The Imitation Game), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rachel McAdams (Sherlock Holmes), Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man), Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale), and Tilda Swinton (The Grand Budapest Hotel). \nThe film is directed by Scott Derrickson (Sinister) and written by Derrickson, Jon Spaihts (Prometheus), and C. Robert Cargill (Sinister).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:05:27.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
