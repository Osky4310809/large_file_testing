Share on Facebook Share Tweet Email Print Advertisement - story continues below \nArnold Schwarzenegger escalated his longstanding social media feud with President Donald Trump, saying in an interview published Monday that he wanted to “smash” the newly sworn-in president’s face. \nThe discord between Trump and Schwarzenegger heated up last month following the former California governor’s debut as host of Celebrity Apprentic e, replacing Trump. \nThe president mocked Schwarzenegger on Twitter for the season premiere’s plummeting ratings, noting the Hollywood legend supported Trump primary foe John Kasich and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
