Our spy photographers have also managed to capture a glimpse of the new GLE’s interior, and here we can see that the SUV range being brought in line with the rest of the Mercedes-Benz model line-up. \nThe instrument cluster is now fully digital, level with the Comand infotainment display which sits atop a row of quad air-conditioning vents, albeit rectangular here compared to the circular units found in the W213 E-Class and the W222 S-Class , replacing the vertically oriented rectangular vents in the current W166 model . \nThe dashboard also employs a more floating design, which here also now features a pair of grab handles, one for each side. Not visible here, though also expected, is Mercedes’ ambient lighting setup, which is configurable for various colours in the W222 S-Class and the W213 E-Class. For the one in the hot seat, the steering wheel is now one with a smaller central boss; an item which will gradually find its way into most, if not all future Mercedes-Benz cars. \nAs a whole, the next MHA-based GLE (the MRA for its SUV models) in expected to grow in overall size slightly to distance itself from the GLC , which itself is slightly bigger than the GLK it replaced. New inline-six petrol and diesel engines could also feature, following their expected debut with the W222 S-Class facelift . \nGALLERY: Mercedes-Benz GLE 400 road trip Research Mercedes-Benz Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T06:25:14.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
