(PTI) \nUnion Home Minister Rajnath Singh will not celebrate Holi in view of Sukma Maoist attack that claimed lives of 12 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans. After paying a visit to Narayana Hospital in Raipur where the CRPF personnel, injured in a Maoist attack, are undergoing treatment, Rajnath yesterday announced that Rs. one crore would be provided as compensation to the deceased. “We have decided that a total compensation to kin of the soldiers who were killed in the attack shouldn’t be less than Rs. 1 crore under any circumstances,” Singh said. \nHe also assured that the country would not let the soldier’s sacrifice go in vain and said that a heavy retaliation would be given to the Maoists. “We want to assure the country that martyrdom of our soldiers will not go in vain. We are confident that we’ll be able to control the activities of Maoists,” Singh said. At least 12 personnel of the 219-battalion from the CRPF were killed and six others critically injured in a Maoist attack near Bhejji in Sukma district. \nYesterday eleven Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed when Naxals ambushed a road opening party of the security forces in Maoist-hit Sukma district of Chhattisgarh, police said. Five jawans were also injured in the attack that took place in the dense forests of Bhejji police station limits at 9:15 AM when a patrol party of CRPF’s 219 battalion was out for a road opening task near Kotacheru village. 112 security personnel were part of the patrol party. \nAlso Watch: \nThe Naxals also looted ten weapons and two radio sets from the killed men, officials said. A senior official told PTI that the road opening party (ROP) of CRPF’s 219th battalion was on an operation to ensure security to a patch on the under-construction Injram-Bhejji road, around 450 kms away from the state capital. While the ROP was passing through the forests between Bhejji and Kottacheru villages, Naxals opened indiscriminate fire on them, he said. \n(With inputs from PTI) Please Wait while comments are loading...
