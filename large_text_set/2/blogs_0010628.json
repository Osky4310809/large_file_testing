It’s time to revive Lord Dubs’s scheme to save children with a public appeal ‘She was well aware that she had been snatched out of a very dangerous situation.’ Ursula (standing) on Dartmoor in 1939. Photograph: Jenny Plunkett View more sharing options Close   14.29 GMT \nI think often about the refugees that we in the UK aren’t helping, especially the unaccompanied children wandering about Europe. I probably feel so strongly because at the age of eight (I am now 86), I acquired a big sister who was a refugee. Ending the Dubs scheme will put child refugees at the mercy of traffickers | Aidan McQuade Read more \nMy mother had had a nightmare, in which Hitler and his stormtroopers were marching along our local high street. She was also moved by a poster showing a girl and boy, with the words “Get them out while there is time”. She happened to have a meeting with the headmistress of the school I went to at the time and as she was leaving, she said: “We have decided to offer a home to a Jewish child.” She was asked to stay and talk it over. The school staff had volunteered support for a couple of girls of 13 or 14. In the end, it was just one: my sister. Two staff members put up the money for her school fees, an arrangement was made to provide her with school uniform and it was settled that she would come and live with us. These arrangements were necessary as, although we lived in a big house, there wasn’t a lot of money to spare. Ursula in 1940. Photograph: Jenny Plunkett \nMy mother prepared my brother and me, explaining that treats would now have to be shared between three. Richard Attenborough, who also grew up with two Kindertransport girls told a similar story in the preface to the documentary Into the Arms of Strangers, where his father told him and his brothers that what they could do as a family of five, they couldn’t afford as a family of seven. The three boys nevertheless welcomed their two new sisters and he goes on to say: “We came to love each other very much.” I can say the same. \nMy parents and two members of the school staff went to the holiday camp near Harwich where the children were temporarily housed in unheated chalets and they found Ursula. That night, they returned home late and I was reading in bed. My mother brought Ursula in to see me. I remember she said “Good morning”. And she was wearing a glamorous halo hat. My mother took her to see her bedroom and invited her to go downstairs to have supper. It was January 1939 and she was one of the 10,000 Kindertransport children brought to Britain to escape Nazi Germany. I had just turned eight and Ursula must have been 13. My three-year-old brother was fast asleep in the nursery. \nI remember, although Ursula does not, that I used to wake up very early in the morning, creep past the staircase and get into Ursula’s bed. She taught me a lot of German songs. Of course it is sheer chance that we formed an affectionate relationship, but perhaps she herself had an ability to love that enabled her to fit into our family. She was well aware that she had been snatched out of a very dangerous situation. I remember her talking about Kristallnacht. I remember the last Red Cross letter that came from her father, telling her that he and her mother were going to be taken to “a work camp” the next day and that he wouldn’t be able to write to her again. I remember the day in 1944 when she was given the news that her parents had been killed in Auschwitz. Ursula with Patricia. Photograph: Jenny Plunkett \nOf course I can only guess what she suffered, first from being separated from her parents and then, later, when she was told of their death. What I do know is that Ursula had one driving aim in life: she wanted to become a nurse. She survived a two-year probationary period at a local hospital, a subsidiary of Guy’s in London. She hoped after that to be accepted at Guy’s, but she was turned down. My mother went to see the matron, told her Ursula’s story and she was accepted as a probationer, starting her training all over again. War was still raging and London was still being bombed, and then there were the V1s and the V2s . She told me a few days ago on the telephone that she remembers one night being woken by my father shouting to her to come downstairs. As she got up she saw through the window a V1 going by. By then she was old enough to be allowed to go fire-watching with my father. She had her own tin hat. So did my mother, who drove an ambulance. I was looking forward to being old enough to join in. My brother borrowed anybody’s tin hat to collect shrapnel. \nAfter Guy’s, Ursula continued her training and spent her life nursing, becoming a member of Queen Elizabeth’s Overseas Nursing Service. She also found the time to go to balls, parties and picnics, get married and have two children. At nearly 92, she is alive, (fairly) well and living in Australia. \nPerhaps it is not generally realised how much refugees contribute to the country that gave them sanctuary. On a personal level, I know I benefited from having a loving older sister. Her life speaks for itself, a valuable one saved thanks to the efforts of the many people in the Kindertransport and its founder, Nicholas Winton, but also the Red Cross workers on the trains and the people who worked with the children at the holiday camps in Harwich. It was a truly collective effort with many diverse helpers. \nLord Dubs , a Kindertransport child himself, made a good beginning, but I believe he thought the figure of 3,000 child refugees was insufficient and even that low figure will not be achieved given that the government has abandoned the scheme and has only let in 350 children. Perhaps it is time for a public appeal, not just for funds, but for families who would take a child. We need to make an organised collective effort once again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:46:42.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
