I have flown united before with literally no pants on. Just a top as a dress. Next time I will wear only jeans and a scarf. \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) March 26, 2017 \nUnited’s initial response — that it “shall have the right to refuse passengers who are not properly clothed”— exacerbated the confusion and anger online. \nMany asked whether the airline was saying that it could deny service to paying customers just because they wore yoga pants. \n“Leggings are business attire for 10 year olds. Their business is being children,” tweeted actress Patricia Arquette. @united Leggings are business attire for 10 year olds. Their business is being children. \n— Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) March 26, 2017 \nHours later, the airline clarified its response. It tweeted that the passengers who were flying “were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel.” \nThe longstanding policy requires those who enjoy the perks of airline employment, which include free travel passes for family and guests, to present themselves in a way that represents the airline well. \nREAD: ‘Jon & Kate Plus 8’ Reality Star To Make Debut As Stripper At Atlantic City Nightclub \nAccording to the policy, which was provided to CNNMoney by a United employee, “pass riders” aren’t allowed to wear clothing that doesn’t look “neat and professional.” \nThat includes form-fitting lycra or spandex tops, pants and dresses, offensive or derogatory words or graphics on clothing, “excessively dirty” clothing that has holes or tears, or anything that is “inappropriately revealing.” \n“Pass riders should use good judgment and common sense” about items not explicitly on their list, according to the policy. \nAnd it says dress attire for those using the perks “should always meet or exceed the casual standards” of the flying public. \nThe-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
