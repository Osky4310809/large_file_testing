He appears human, has all the features and all that, but watching him play basketball for a few minutes makes it apparent he’s a metahuman, mutant, or alien of some sort. \nHe should not be that big, that agile and able to throw down a dunk that powerfully. But he can. And it’s amazing (even if it’s a little bit off-putting and scary in case he ever decides to use his powers for evil).\nThe Thunder were the recipients of those powers late in the Bucks’ 98-94 victory on Monday. Talented rookie Domantas Sabonis was the poor sap at the wrong end of Giannis’ latest display of his supernatural ability as he did his best to “defend” this absurd dunk in which Giannis simply decided “I’m going to jump higher than that guy and slam it in” – and did. \nIt was quite the display, and making it even more impressive was fellow alien Russell Westbrook’s valiant but ultimately useless attempt to swat or deter the dunk. It didn’t matter as Giannis flushed it home practically undeterred despite the 6’10 human in his way and Russell on his back. \nIt wasn’t the only time the two met at the rim in the game either, as he tossed this layup attempt toward the crowd earlier in the game. Impressive, even if it didn’t count. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T04:41:04.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
