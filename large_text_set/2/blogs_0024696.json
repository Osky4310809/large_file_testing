Donations to the organization cover the cost of materials as well as shipping. She delivered them this week.\nEach bear is given a St. Michael medal, which is often worn by officers as a prayer for protection and blessed by a priest before the family receives it free of charge.\nHer mother, Suzie O’Grady, said that her daughter has received at least 20 more bear requests via Facebook, including one from a woman whose brother was killed in the line of duty during the 1980s. It takes her five to six hours to create each bear.\n“It’s remarkable to see her have such purpose,” Suzie O’Grady said. “To see that she can make a difference in the world at her age is inspiring to us as parents.”\nMegan presented her first handmade bear Monday to Johnny Brinson, the son of fallen Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton .\nClayton, a 17-year veteran of the force, was fatally shot in January while confronting murder suspect Markeith Loyd , who was wanted in the December death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend.\nThe bear was created from different parts of Clayton’s uniform shirt, Megan said. The black buttons adorning her uniform were used for the stuffed animal’s nose and eyes. Extra fabric from Clayton’s shirt was used to sew a personalized badge with her last name and badge number on the bear’s stomach.\nBrinson ran his fingers along the three-striped insignia on the bear’s left arm, directly below the embroidered uniform patch bearing “Orlando Police.”\nHe thought he would never see or feel the patch again, Brinson said after he was presented with the bear Monday. The stuffed bear is “one of the best” gifts he has received, he added.\n“I always hugged her in her uniform, even before she went to work,” Brinson said. “We were that close. We talked every day, every hour.”\nOrlando Police Chief John Mina said he was overcome with joy when he heard how Megan was helping families cope with the loss of a loved one.\n“When I found out [the bears] were actually going to be made out of Debra’s uniform, it was hard not to get emotional,” Mina said. “It just means the world to us.”\nA few hours after the presentation, Megan delivered three teddy bears to the family of Orange County Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis, 35, who was killed in a traffic crash while helping search for Loyd on Jan. 9.\nMegan is not limiting herself just to Florida. She is already creating teddy bears for grieving families living in New York, Illinois, Nevada and other states.\n“We want to make it nationwide so that everyone can feel the same love as the people we’ve visited so far,” Megan said. “We want to reach out and impact people’s lives.”\nsmedel@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5257\nPrivacy Policy Homicide Crime Markeith Loyd", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58acde93/turbine/os-blue-line-bears-honor-fallen-officers-20170221", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58adcef1/turbine/os-markeith-loyd-to-judge-i-don-t-wanna-talk-to-you-orlando-news-now-20170222", "https://api.nlr.tronc.com/v3/newsletters/subscriptions&newsletterApiKey=t2RIwsHk5p8RFZ0sPKLEr2M0Rh64DNz69BDRyGQa&grecaptchaSiteKey=6Le1uQoUAAAAAJlmu5Oue58PyhPzc_ZLYtR7AzKt&aid=2089072590&allurl=http://membership.orlandosentinel.com/newsletters", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58adbec9/turbine/os-an-orlando-police-officer-berates-a-man-during-a-disturbance-call-20170222", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ace3e9/turbine/os-great-grandmother-fights-off-would-be-carjackers", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ac99da/turbine/os-pine-hills-home-invasion-results-in-one-dead-deputies-say", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a7246e/turbine/os-polk-county-jail-worker-sex-baby-with-inmate-20170217"], "published": "2017-02-22T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:03:03.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
