It first hit the stage off-Broadway in 2007 with Miranda in the lead role of Usnavi, a Dominican store-owner in Washington Heights. \nWith the film adaptation, Miranda is not planning on reprising his role, but might join the cast as a different character. The movie will be directed by Now You See Me 2 ‘s Jon M. Chu and the screenplay will come from Quiara Alegría Hudes, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for her play, Water by the Spoonful . \nIn the Heights won multiple Tony Awards in 2008, including Best Musical and Best Original Score. \nJay Z helped produce the revival of Annie in 2014. He is currently working on Time: The Kalief Browder Story , a docu-series telling the story of a teenager who was wrongly incarcerated for allegedly stealing a backpack. Browder spent three years at Rikers Island before his release. He committed suicide after being freed from jail.
