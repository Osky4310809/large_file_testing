Mahesh Bhatt all set to BREAK the Pakistani artistes' ban by signing Ali Zafar in his next? By DNA | Published: February 25, 2017 12:02 pm Mahesh Bhatt inaugurates art gallery! \nWe all know that a ban was imposed on Pakistani artistes last year in the wake of the devastating Uri Attacks. Many producers and directors were against this move, however due to the political pressure everyone had to bow down. But is this blanket ban on Pakistani artistes over? The unofficial ban notwithstanding, Mahesh Bhatt is all set to bring back Pakistani artistes to India. Last week Bhatt made a call to singer-actor Ali Zafar in Karachi offering him a song on the theme of cross-border peace and from what we hear Ali has responded favourably. So did Shafqat Amanat Ali who has agreed to contribute a song to Mahesh Bhatt’s endeavour free of cost. \nDelhi-based actor Imran Zahid who will be working with Mahesh Bhatt on this project says, “Every Pakistani artiste Bhatt saab has approached has responded enthusiastically. Shafqat Amanat Ali’s manager said he doesn’t want any money for this song. We are also working on getting Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Atif Aslam on board.” \nBut what about the unofficial ban on Pakistani artistes in India? Says Imran, “We are going to use the voices of the Pakistani artistes, for a play called Milne Do which will be staged in Delhi on June 8 and Mumbai on June 23. Furthermore the Indian government has clarified that it has not banned Pakistani artistes. When the Government has taken a clear stand on the issue, what chance do the protesters stand?” ALSO READ – Fawad Khan FINALLY breaks his silence on Pakistani artistes ban – read statement! \nImran doesn’t rule out local pockets of protest at the Pakistani presence in our land. As he added, “Bhatt saab is not new to protests. Dialogue with Pakistan must re-start on a cultural level. The Delhi government is supporting our endeavour here in Delhi and in West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has extended support to our mission.” \nHowever, BJP spokesperson Shaina NC is clear on the issue, as she mentioned, “Relations with Pakistan have deteriorated to such an extent that there is a move now to declare Pakistan a terror state on an international level. Given the current crisis I don’t think we can have Pakistani artistes coming here.” ALSO READ – Salman Khan wipes out his Pakistani artistes’ comment with this Facebook post – check it out \nWhat do you guys think – should the ban on Pakistani artistes be lifted or should it continue?
