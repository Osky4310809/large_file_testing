Twenty-four-year-old designer Alejandro Gomez Palomo founded the label less than a year ago with a debut collection titled Orlando, based on Virginia Woolf’s novelistic take on the Shakespearean gender-fluid character. Tracksuits came in jewel tones with peplums and bishop sleeves—fit for any Elizabethan sports fanatics out there. Poet shirts were done in robin’s egg blue, and for the dramatic disco eccentric, there were tear-away denim flares. “I feel that boys need to discover different ways to wear clothes that we haven’t been able to wear up until now,” said Palomo recently via phone. This past season he translated his otherworldly, frill-forward attitude into more Elizabethan touches: Ruffles fanned out at the arm in a flouncy fashion, while blouses were cropped and the shoulders left exposed. Even the classic pinstripe suit received a magical makeover via a dipping décolletage embroidered with flowers. \n“I project what I desire and then I bring it to my own universe. Like ‘Let’s take it to a different level and fantasize a bit more in the way they dress,’ ” Palomo said. He sources mostly vintage materials, from a now-closed factory in Córdoba, Spain. “I work with materials that are usually used for womenswear,” he said. He also worked with “a very traditional haute couture fabric house that my seamstress has been using her entire career. She does the dressmaking for older and wealthy women. That is the most feminine aspect of my sewing.” \nStill, many buyers are purchasing the pieces for women. (After all, what girl wouldn’t want to try on a pair of those Pepto pink velvet flares or that fuchsia sequined jumpsuit?). Even though he maintains his clothes are made for men, and designed with men’s bodies in mind, Palomo takes this in stride. “It is erotic to be buying men’s clothes that are actually something really feminine,” he said. “I think there is an attachment of mystery and excitement for women to buy men’s clothes.” As for Palomo Spain’s next chapter, mark February 3 on the calendar: The label was invited by the CFDA to show at New York Men’s Fashion Week .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T03:30:07.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
