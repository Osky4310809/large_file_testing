Edgard Arevalo, chief of the AFP Public Affairs Offices, said in a statement. “While they may want to exercise both, they should do so with due regard to the people who stands to suffer the disruptions in livelihood and well-being.” \nA “lightning” rally by supposed members of the New People’s Army caused heavy traffic on the Cubao stretch of Edsa Cubao on Monday morning, two days ahead of their 48th anniversary on Wednesday. The protesters were in combat uniforms and carrying NPA flags, calling on Filipinos to join them.
