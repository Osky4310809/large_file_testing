Hamilton was previously an assistant to Harbaugh at Stanford. \nThe Browns don’t actually have an offensive coordinator on their staff, as head coach Hue Jackson handles many of the duties usually handled by an offensive coordinator, but Hamilton is Cleveland’s highest-ranking offensive assistant. \nThese days, “amateur” college football pays its top coaches about as much as professional football does, so Michigan can surely make Hamilton a competitive offer financially. Michigan’s defensive coordinator just signed a five-year contract worth $1.4 million a year , and if Harbaugh is offering Hamilton that kind of contract, Hamilton may think he’d have more job security and make more money at Michigan than in Cleveland. \nMichigan recently lost passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach Jedd Fisch to UCLA, so there’s an opening on Harbaugh’s staff.
