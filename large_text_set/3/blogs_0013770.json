Proud mama Chrissy Teigen gushed about the milestone on her Instagram, sharing a video of the adorable moment. \n“What is that?” the mom-of-one asked Luna, pointing to a feline sitting in an outdoor courtyard during the family lunch. \nAfter papa John Legend repeated the word “cat,” the tiny tot caught on and mimicked her parents’ speech. A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Mar 20, 2017 at 6:38am PDT \n“Ah!!! So many firsts,” Teigen captioned the clip, which had garnered more than 2 million views in just five hours. \nHowever, that wasn’t Luna’s only first time learning about a furry friend. Just last week, Luna was able to come face-to-face with a live rabbit when her parents set up a temporary petting zoo in their backyard. \n“Gentle, gentle,” Teigen cooed as she carried her daughter to pet a bunny. After touching the creature’s fur, Luna started smiling and continued to pet the animal. \nHow cute! \nMar 14, 2017 at 11:43am PDT Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:33:24.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
