And freshman Lonzo Ball announced that this was his last college basketball game right afterwards. \nKentucky freshmen De'Aaron Fox and Malik Monk led the way for the Wildcats with 39 and 21 points, respectively. Next, Kentucky will face North Carolina in the Elite Eight on Sunday. \nFor now, though, Twitter reacted exactly as you thought it would: We're gonna need a separate Twitter just for LaVar Ball shade tweets — Seth Davis (@SethDavisHoops) March 25, 2017 \"If I was coaching we would have beat Kentucky.\" - LaVar Ball pic.twitter.com/sUhOl6oPdI — Bryce Wood (@woodymlb4) March 25, 2017 Um, Mr. Lavar Bell..i DID try and tell ya.
