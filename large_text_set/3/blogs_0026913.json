(Photo: Instagram) (Photo: Instagram) \n\"What a hol so far, belly still aches from laughing with mum and dad yesterday. Oh...and... Gemma 1 cigarettes NIL. day 4! Thanks for all the support. Means so so much!\" \nHer hot bod comes as she revealed thought she had found something special as she began dating Nick last year. \nBut her dream was shattered when he dumped her by text. \nThe actress dated dad-of-four Nick, 54, briefly in September after meeting at the TV Choice Awards. \nNick had called her “beautiful” and, after learning she had brought her gay best friend as her date, told Gemma: “Well I’m not gay, I’m single and I’m not an idiot. Let me take you out for dinner.” \nThe DIY SOS star swept her off her feet for a romantic weekend in Edinburgh, during which she poured her heart out to him. \nBut as they lay in bed he got a text saying pictures of them had emerged. \nGemma said he turned cold and shortly after “dropped her like a ton of bricks” – before publicly insisting his only priority was rebuilding a relationship with his estranged wife Jessica, 29, the mum of his youngest child Eddie, two. \nHull-born Gemma watched as Nick and Jess reunited and then split again in January. \nShe now insists the whole experience has taught her a valuable lesson and made her stronger. She said: “The experience with Nick knocked my confidence and I’ve learned to keep my guard up since dating him. \n“My friends tell me I always wear my heart on my sleeve and I’m too trusting. \n“Now when I go on dates I don’t reveal as much about myself. From an upsetting ordeal I’ve learned a positive lesson. \n“It was upsetting and hurtful, but it hasn’t put me off men.\" \nShe last saw Nick at January’s National Television Awards at London’s O2 Arena. \nShe claims he didn’t even speak to her when he saw her.
