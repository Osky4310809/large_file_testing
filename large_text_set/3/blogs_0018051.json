Last time, they said a lot regarding the play-by-play man missing the show and even JBL had something to say, but the former WWE Champion ended up deleting his tweet. \nSomeone else who has been noticeably silent on social media is Mauro Ranallo who was usually very active on his Twitter. Now, he hasn’t posted anything in about a week and his last tweet was actually a foreshadowing to his absence on the last SmackDown Live . \nMaybe. Snow may stop that from happening. https://t.co/Smd7zAQ7i8 \n— Mauro Ranallo (@mauroranallo) March 14, 2017 \nSome have speculated that there are bigger issues between Ranallo and WWE that haven’t yet made it out for the public to know about. As reported by Sherdog a couple of years ago, Ranallo also suffers from bipolar disorder and some believe that may be the reason he has been missing for two weeks in a row. [Image by WWE] \nComicBook.com is reporting that there is some speculation that Ranallo’s time with WWE could prematurely be coming to an end, but there is nothing to support that at this time. All that is known at this time is that snow kept him away last week and this time, Ranallo is said to be sick. \nHe really has become one of the best play-by-play announcers in all of professional wrestling and SmackDown Live simply isn’t the same without him. It will be interesting to see if WWE makes any official comment on Ranallo’s absence or if he just comes back for the next episode. \nWhen Mauro Ranallo was signed by WWE, there were those who questioned the move, but he has proven that he belongs. His voice and talent have given a big-fight feel to matches on SmackDown Live and he’s become one of the best play-by-play announcers in the business. Last week, he shouldn’t have missed the show but the snow could end up being a legitimate reason. Being absent for a second week in a row means that there is something much more to this whole story. \n[Featured Image by WWE]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:30:45.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
