SHANNON STAPLETON \nUS President Donald Trump sits with PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel during a meeting with technology leaders at Trump Tower in New York. \nAfter all, it's not as if Thiel slipped the Government a burlap sack stuffed with $20 notes in exchange for a New Zealand passport and a lifestyle block. \nHe's been a resident since 2006 and a permanent resident since 2009, giving him more than a decade of formal ties to the country. \nDuring that time, Thiel has poured millions of dollars into Kiwi companies and donated $1 million to the Christchurch earthquake appeal fund following the city's devastating earthquakes. EMMA DANGERFIELD/FAIRFAX NZ \nAs Prime Minister Bill English said this week, we're better off as a country if people like Thiel want to come here. \nHe has promoted New Zealand on the world stage as a utopia, praising our \"stark beauty\" and \"number eight wire mentality\". Ad Feedback \nUnlike William Yan and Kim Dotcom, two previous high-profile migration cases, Thiel is not wanted by any law enforcement agencies. \nIn fact, his biggest crimes appear to be (in order) backing new US President Donald Trump and, well, being a bit of a weirdo. \nBut like it or not - and I certainly don't - Trump isn't disappearing any time soon, and having a Kiwi as a close confidante may reap rewards that endure well past the Orange One departing the Oval Office. \nAs for Thiel's eccentricities, which include plans to inject himself with young people's blood so he can live until he's 120, there's no denying he's out there. \nBut if weirdness was a disqualifying factor for citizenship, there'd be more than a few native-born Kiwis looking over their shoulders (including some of our politicians). \nBETTER OFF WITH PEOPLE LIKE THIEL \nAs Prime Minister Bill English said this week, we're better off as a country if people like Thiel want to come here to invest in Kiwi businesses and donate to local causes. \nWe're far from alone in providing a path to citizenship for the wealthy, either. \nAustralia, Canada, the UK and the US all offer \"investor visas\" for people willing to pour money into the country. \nOthers go further, offering what are essentially cash for citizenship programmes. \nThankfully we're not at that level, nor should we be. \nBut encouraging the best and brightest to lay down roots in New Zealand is something we should embrace, rather than taking up pitchforks against those whose ideologies we disagree with. \nThe Government still must front up with the reasons for granting Thiel citizenship under \"exceptional circumstances\". \nTheir reluctance to release information so far does add a shred of doubt, although the Department of Internal Affairs has said it will release documents about Thiel next week. \nFOCUS ON VULNERABLE, NOT WEALTHY \nCritics wanting to target the Government over migration should instead focus on the shameful exploitation of vulnerable immigrants. \nThose like Pritpal Singh, who came here in search of a brighter future but instead found himself working 80-hour weeks for as little as $25 a day , are being badly let down by the system. \nWhether an American billionaire or an Indian student, anyone who wants to come to New Zealand, follow our laws and make a positive difference should be welcomed with open arms. \nInstead of obsessing over the political peccadilloes of someone like Thiel, let's focus on those like Pritpal who really need our help. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T08:07:03.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
