Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA Steve Madeley at Sincil Bank   22.12   22.20   \nThe spirit of Graham Taylor appeared to be everywhere at Sincil Bank as Lincoln City honoured their former manager then produced a stunning win of which he would surely have been proud. \nHaving frustrated Ipswich Town of the Championship at Portman Road 10 days earlier, the Red Imps of the National League dominated their loftier opponents on home turf and claimed a famous victory thanks to Nathan Arnold’s superb winner in stoppage time. Sutton’s Maxime Biamou and Dan   Wimbledon in FA Cup Read more \nThe night began with a minute’s applause for the former England manager, who began his career in coaching with Lincoln. \nTaylor, who died last week, was honoured again as fans lit up the stadium in the second half, but the current players of his former club lit up the tie throughout. \nThey had the better of the chances to give Mick McCarthy, the under-pressure Ipswich manager, another uncomfortable evening in the FA Cup . \nBefore this third-round replay, McCarthy was without a win in eight games in charge of the Suffolk club in the FA Cup. \nThe home side made a confident start and their belief and high tempo brought them the first attempt on goal in the ninth minute. A quick move down the right allowed them to feed the midfielder Arnold, who dragged a shot wide from 25 yards. \nYet they had a reminder of Ipswich’s threat moments later when the hosts were caught out for pace and visiting striker Tom Lawrence connected with a shot from the edge of the area that drew a routine save from Paul Farman in the Lincoln goal. \nThere was no inferiority complex from the hosts, however, and the 8,000 home supporters in a capacity crowd roared them on to another half-chance in the 16th minute. The winger Terry Hawkridge checked inside on to his right foot and floated a cross on to the head of the giant striker Matt Rhead, who sent a far-post effort narrowly wide. \nThe threat of the non-league side was clear and, after the midfielder Alan Power had a firm shot charged down on the edge of the penalty area, Theo Robinson went even closer after collecting a cross from the left. The forward’s strength allowed him to turn towards goal and unleash a low, powerful effort which was blocked by the defender Luke Chambers. \nAn even clearer chance arrived 16 minutes before half-time when Robinson drifted out wide to turn provider for Alex Woodyard. The forward’s cross was perfect for the late run of the midfielder, but he failed to hit the target with his head from 10 yards and an excellent opportunity was missed. \nIt was a similar story a couple of minutes later when Hawkridge moved from left to right to bend a teasing cross to the far post, with a stooping Rhead heading narrowly off target. \nThe first half ended with Cowley’s men still on top and they ought to have taken the lead in the dying seconds when captain Luke Waterfall met a free-kick and turned it towards goal. The defender, though, saw his effort saved superbly by visiting goalkeeper Dean Gerken. McCarthy looked a picture of agitation as the opening period came to a close. \nLincoln began the second period as they had ended the first, with a teasing free-kick from Sam Habergham forcing the visitors into a hurried clearance. \nHome goalkeeper Farman had been a virtual spectator but he had to make a confident catch just before the hour-mark to claim a flick-on by Berra from a long throw. \nThen he was forced into a smart save when Ipswich finally registered their second effort on goal through Josh Emmanuel. But Arnold raised the roof in stoppage time, collecting a pass from substitute Adam Marriott and rounding Gerken before producing a cool finish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:32:35.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
