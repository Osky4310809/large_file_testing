Sawant, just 45, is survived by his wife and daughter and it was only recently he had trained the Rest of India side ahead of the 201617 Irani Trophy match against Gujarat. \nLike the rest of the Mumbai cricket community, his close friend Subodh Vaidya, a scorer with Mumbai Cricket Association, had reason to be shocked by the news. \nIt was only on Saturday that he was 'joking around' with 'Sawantiya,' as he would fondly call him, at the warm-up match between India Colts and the England Under-19 teams at the Wankhede Stadium. \"I knew him since my college days. He was playing for Khandu Rangnekar XI in the Sports Star Trophy (U-19 tournament). I met him more frequently in the past five years, since he became a physical trainer, especially when he was at the BCCI batting academy at BKC. We used to have fun together. We used to train at Central maidan in Thane. I used to keep wickets for him at our club in Thane. When I shook hands with him yesterday, I'd no clue that it was the last time I was meeting him. I'm still in a state of shock. How can this happen to a fitness trainer, who would be all the more conscious about his fitness. It's a big loss for me,\" rued Vaidya. \nHailing from Dombivli, Sawant began his career promisingly when the budding pacer was picked up by the BCA Mafatlal bowling scheme in the early 90s. Though he was amongst the probables continuously from around 1993 to 2000, he couldn't go on to play for Mumbai. \"He was dear friend of everyone who played for Mumbai in that generation. I remember every moment I spent with him. He missed playing Mumbai by a whisker. He was an extremely likeable, lively, bubbly, humorous and jovial character. He would always keep pulling someone or the other's leg. He would keep the atmosphere light in the dressing room. He was an example of how a player can be famous despite not being in the XI. There was something different about him.He was one of the most popular figures in Mumbai cricket,\" remembered ex-Mumbai wicketkeeper turned coach Sulakshan Kulkarni. \nSince his playing days, Sawant developed a close bond with Mumbai cricketers from the Thane-Dombivli region. \"We (Sawant, Kulkarni, Mayur Kadrekar, Nilesh Kulkarni and Rajesh Sutar), would all go in the same car to practise from Thane to RCF, and from there, Ballu (Balwinder Singh Sandhu, the then Mumbai coach) would take us to the Wankhede Stadium in Churchgate,\" Kulkarni remembered. \nBatting legend Sachin Tendulkar too remembers facing Sawant in the Mumbai nets in the 90s. A couple of years back, he sought his assistance as a physical trainer too. \"He came to my home for around seven-ten days to help me do my exercises. He was a fit, disciplined and committed guy. He had the right qualities to be a physical trainer,\" Tendulkar told TOI. \n\"It's unbelievable,\" said former India and Mumbai left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni, who was Sawant's 'close friend' for the past 25 years. \"We used to travel from Dombivili in train for the BCA Mafatlal bowling scheme. I used to take him out for dinner. All those are just memories now. His only regret was that could never play for Mumbai, despite being in the probables. But I was happy that he was living that dream by being a part of the dressing room by becoming a trainer,\" said Kulkarni. © TNN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:08:36.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
