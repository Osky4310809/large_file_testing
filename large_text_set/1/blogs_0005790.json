The season's main educational goal is how to demonstrate kindness [1] and convey the lessons through new themes relevant to the lives and interests of a typical preschool child (such as bedtime, boo-boos and animals). Fewer celebrity and parody segments are employed this season, as studies have shown fewer parents (whom the segments are geared toward) are co-viewing with their children. [1] \nThe show also tightens its focus in on a smaller number of select characters: “ The cast of Muppets, which has mushroomed over the decades, will be pared down to focus on a core six: Elmo , Cookie Monster , Abby Cadabby , Grover , Big Bird and Oscar . The others will still be on the show, but the core cast will be the daily focus. [2] ” \nDebuting in the season is a new Cookie Monster segment, \" Smart Cookies .\" New editions of \" Elmo the Musical \" also debut (now running seven minutes), and \" Elmo's World \" is reintroduced to the show, with re-edited, high-definition versions of older segments. Also introduced are new opening and closing song sequences , the former marking the first time the theme sequence has taken place on the street set itself. Episodes also no longer feature the characters reiterating the sponsors of the day at the show's end. \nThe \" What's the Word on the Street? \" cold opens have been discontinued in favor of brief scenes of the Muppet characters introducing the topic of each show. The Word of the Day segments have been cut as well. \nThe season also marks the show's move to a new channel. The episodes debut first-run on HBO and will air on PBS following a nine-month window. [3] The season also introduces a shortened, half-hour format, completely dropping the hour-long run time. Cast changes Edit \nFollowing the retirement of Fran Brill the previous fall, Stephanie D'Abruzzo takes over the role of Prairie Dawn and Jennifer Barnhart is cast as Zoe . Sonia Manzano retired prior to the season taping and therefore does not return as Maria . [4] Also leaving the cast are Nitya Vidyasagar ( Leela ) and Ismael Cruz Córdova ( Mando ). Joining the cast is a new recurring human character named Nina , played by actress Suki Lopez . On July 28, 2016, it was announced that Bob McGrath , Roscoe Orman , and Emilio Delgado would not be returning to the show [5] ; however, this was later explained as a misunderstanding as no scenes had been written for them this season. [6] Joey Mazzarino departed from Sesame Workshop a few months prior to the season's premiere, making this his last season involved with the show. Set changes \nThe season introduces new changes to the set in an effort to get viewers to associate the Muppet characters with specific locales, evoke a greater sense of community, and to modernize the look of the street. [7] Changes include: Elmo's room is now located in the first floor cornerstone of 123 Sesame Street . Cookie Monster takes up new residence above Hooper's Store , which is given a complete facelift to resemble its initial design. Big Bird's nest area is no longer hidden by used construction doors and is now sitting within a small, furnished tree. Oscar's trash can is relocated to a dumpster unit in front of 123 Sesame Street. Oscar is also given the ability to appear from trash receptacles around the street. An expanded garden area is added in the arbor , maintained by Abby Cadabby. Other additions include a community center in the carriage house (with rooftop sitting area) and a Newsstand , located between the Subway Station and the Laundromat . \nThe changes were designed by David Gallo . [7] The new set elements were constructed by Showman Fabricators and Gotham Scenic (who built Oscar's new enclosure, the newsstand and Big Bird's nest).
