This is real talk. Julian Edelman, just because he is a caucasian receiver, they don’t give him the credit that he deserves. He deserves so much more. This kid can flat out play. [There] hasn’t been an answer for him over the last several years. Julian Edelman moves chains, he can get deep, he works between the numbers, works outside the numbers, he can throw the football, he can can run the football — he can do it all, man.” Follow Trent Baker", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T07:41:38.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
