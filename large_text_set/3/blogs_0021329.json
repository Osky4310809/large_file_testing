He added, “I said if I remember that one, I’m gonna report it to the people of Kentucky, ’cause they like it when people actually stand for the American flag.” \nTuesday on Undisputed , Skip Bayless condemned Trump for, in his view, invoking Kaepernick for some cheap applause in front of a conservative audience. \n“It did feel like a desperate act on the part of the President,” Bayless said. “Just to play to the crowd, because they’re gonna wave the flag right back.” \nBayless added that Trump’s stance is going to make it extra difficult for NFL teams to sign him. \nIn this case, it, to me, became a sad day when the President of the United States of America drew a line in the sand, and he dared NFL owners to step across that line. Because if you do, you’re going to get an angry tweet from the President of the United States, condemning you for signing him. Right? Well, that’s one way to shut up a protestor in the United States of America. \nWatch above, via Fox Sports 1. \n[featured image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:40:58.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
