WITH TWINS! \nBut was it totally unexpected? \nMaybe not. Some sharp-eyed fans have found a few clues on Bey’s Instagram that suggest she has actually been hinting at the pregnancy for months. Hardcore Beyhivers might recall this festive photo montage Bey posted on Instagram around Christmas. \nNow, look at the photo very closely. Notice anything? \nThere are three pretty significant photos back-to-back. First, there’s a pic of Bey holding her stomach. Instagram \nAt the time, it just seemed like a sexy Beyoncé pose, but now it’s taken on a whole new meaning. It’s immediately followed by a pic of Bey holding up two fingers. Instagram \nAgain, it just seemed like a peace sign at the time. But now it seems like a hidden message from Bey: TWO BABIES! Finally, there’s a pic of Bey making the heart sign with her hands… Instagram \nBecause she’s so full of love for her two, new, beautiful babies! \nY . Shout out to all the detective fans who figured this out. \nSince these photos were taken only a month ago, I think it’s safe to say Bey knew about her babies by then, which makes it very likely this is, in fact, a hint. \nIf you look closely, you actually can see a slight baby bump in the December photos, too. But some fans also think she told us even earlier, in this post from late July, when she possibly found out the news herself. Instagram \nThat would make Bey at least six months pregnant already, so maybe not. But on the other hand, she does look PRETTY pregnant in that naked pregnancy photo shoot she just did.
