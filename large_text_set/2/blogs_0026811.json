There was an Oscars Best Picture mix-up after the wrong envelope was opened onstage, and that quickly became the story everyone talked about.\nBut we don’t want the weird mix-up to take our focus off of all the fabulous fashion at the awards last night. We saw some beautiful looks on the red carpet. And we loved every stunning minute of it. But most exciting was the totally amazing twinning moment between two of our favorite women .\nEmma Roberts and Michelle Williams were twinning in fabulous black and white looks. Look at these two! They both wore classic dresses with a low-cut black top and simple white skirt . We bow down to both of them for their incredible taste, and their totally down to earth sense of humor about the twinning moment! \nA post shared by Jenna Hipp (@jennahipp) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:56pm PST \nEmma even exclaimed, “I love your dress!” as the pair adorably giggled together in Busy Philipps’ Instagram story. @busyphilipps / www.instagram.com We loved Emma Robert’s vintage Armani Privé gown with its subtle lacy texture. Jeff Kravitz / Getty We love the texture of the skirt and the low-cut top. Bonus points for that sash-looking waistband.\nAnd Michelle Williams’ Louis Vuitton dress was VERY similar. Kevork Djansezian / Getty What’s so striking about these two gowns is that their skirts are a similar off-white color. We love how Michelle’s skirt sparkles just enough.\nBoth of these ladies showed off their truly perfect fashion sense, and we hope that they had an incredible night at the Oscars!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:01:42.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
