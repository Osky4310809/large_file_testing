(ANI) \nUP polls 2017: The question that the entire nation is waiting for an answer for, now that the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are done and dusted is ‘who will be Uttar Pradesh chief minister’? While most are looking at Home Minister Rajnath Singh as the front-runner in the race for the designation, the names of UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, BJP MP from Gorakhpur Yogi Adityanath and Union minister Manoj Sinha are at the top although in the beginning names like those of BJP General Secretary Varun Gandhi too had cropped up in the discussions on the topic at the highest levels. Maurya is likely not in the running. Famously, party President Amit Shah had said that the person against whose name Maurya puts his stamp of approval, he, as the president will appoint that person as CM. This has widely been interperted as a thumbs down message for Maurya. In between all the discussions, Manoj Sinha’s name emerged as a dark horse frontrunner. However, on Friday the man himself looked to pour cold water on his hopes and said that he is not in the race for the UP CM’s post. The minister clearly said that he is “neither in the race (of UP CM) nor does he know of any such race.” \nThe minister in a talk with News18 said he is “quite happy” with the responsibilities he has at present and he is not running in any race to become the CM of UP. However, discussing about the role of the CM of the state which was till recently ruled by Samajwadi Party (SP), he said that law and order will be the biggest challenge for the person who will be selected for the position and showed confidence that “whoever BJP chooses will do a good job.” \nYou will also like to watch: \nThe BJP has marked huge win in the state winning 325 seats out of 403 seats defeating SP- Congress alliance and Bahujan Samaj Party. Elated over the victory, Sinha gave credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party workers who worked tirelessly for poll campaigning. “All the credit for UP win goes to PM Modi and lakhs of party workers,” said Sinha. \nSinha also did not miss the chance to appreciate the demonetisation move of the Centre in which, it had banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. The large amount of votes in BJP’s favour in UP elections held after demonetisation shows common people have accepted it, he said. \nYou will also like to watch: \nWhile Sinha put a full stop on speculation of him becoming the CM, union minister Piyush Goyal, who was also present on the occassion, said Manoj Sinha would be a good chief minister – now, this has left a lot to interpret. \nMeanwhile, the date of swearing-in ceremony of UP CM has been finalised on March 19 even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP is yet to handpick the right person for the job.
