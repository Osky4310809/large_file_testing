What do I mean by that? I want the people of Puerto Rico to know that God loves them and that there is only one way to enter the gates of heaven—and that is through faith in Jesus Christ, and Him alone. Good works can’t get you into heaven… \nThis post echoed a sentiment expressed not too long ago by Religious Right leader Bryan Fischer when he said , “Isn’t Jesus or God the Father doing some extreme vetting on who He’s allowing to spend eternity with him and who is not?” \nGraham and Fischer are using the Bible to justify their approval Donald Trump ‘s refugee ban, as if biblical “extreme vetting” to determine who’s allowed through the Pearly Gates somehow implies that Jesus would approve of restricting immigration. \nFundamentalists like Graham make it pretty clear that being a Christian isn’t simply about professing faith in Jesus Christ. Graham’s “vetting” process filters out Christians with varying opinions on politics and social issues, many of which the Bible doesn’t directly address. For a man who insists that works won’t get you into Heaven, his social media posts suggest the opposite — that True Christianity™ means checking off the Republican box, the anti-Planned Parenthood box, the literal six-day Creation box, and more. \nIf God’s vetting process looks anything like Graham’s, then the entire system is rigged — and designed to hurt more people than it helps. Coincidentally, that sort of God looks a lot like Donald Trump — which is to say He wouldn’t be a God worthy of worship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:31:20.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
