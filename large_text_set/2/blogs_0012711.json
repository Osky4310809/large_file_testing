Are they coming out of people in the intel community? Or State? Or Defense?'” he asked . \nFormer CIA analyst Tony Shaffer appeared on Fox Business Wednesday , pointing at several former Obama administration figures he believes may have been behind the intelligence community’s leaks to the press regarding Flynn. \nShaffer blamed former CIA director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper and former Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. \nThis isn’t the first time Shaffer has directly called out Brennan. Back in December, Shaffer stated that Brennan was behind the secret CIA assessment leaked to the press that alleged Russian interference in the election to back Donald Trump. \nAdditionally, GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told Bloomberg View columnist Eli Lake earlier this week that intelligence officials are waging a war against the Trump White House from behind the scenes. \n“There does appear to be a well orchestrated effort to attack Flynn and others in the administration,” Nunes said . “From the leaking of phone calls between the president and foreign leaders to what appears to be high-level FISA Court information, to the leaking of American citizens being denied security clearances, it looks like a pattern.” \nNunes wants the FBI to investigate the leaks. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
