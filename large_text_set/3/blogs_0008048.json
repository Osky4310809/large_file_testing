This hammering of the Akalis at the hustings — with Congress set to form the government — is significant as this is for the first time in the electoral history of the state that the party suffered such as humiliating defeat with its tally failing to cross 20 seats (as per trends at 12.50pm) in the 117-member Punjab Vidhan Sabha. \nThe February 4 assembly poll results have left the Akalis in the tatters so much so that some of its top guns were decimated. This performance looks worse than 1972 when the Akalis had bagged just 24 seats. \nLIVE | Punjab election results 2017: What’s happening right now? \nClearly, the verdict amounts to a repudiation of SAD patriarch and chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his decade-long regime, and voters rejecting his development agenda. \nThe poll outcome poses a danger to the legacy of Bada Senior who very carefully was cultivating an image to go down in Sikh history as second most key Sikh leader after Maharaja Ranjit Singh. \nPanthic anger, sulking cadre and the corrupt coterie that surrounded the Akali leadership, leading to complete disconnect with the foot soldiers did the party in. And the SAD defeat is a stunning culmination of an explosive campaign that polarised the voters. \nThe outcome underlines the humiliation of India’s second oldest party. Top Akali leaders including CM Badal, his son and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and cabinet ministers had to fight hard to beat the Congress and AAP in their bastions, while several senior ministers bit the dust. \nWHY THEYLOST \nWhen in political hot waters, Akalis’ war cry used to be ‘Panth in peril’. It was for the first time that it was ‘Panth’ that dented and damaged beyond repair the Akalis. \nIt was this Panthic anger -- non-resolution of the emotive sacrilege issue -- that had snowballed into a statewide anti-Akali surge. This was the most potent issue that worked to the disadvantage of the Akali Dal. Because of this issue the Akali Dal lost their grip on its core Panthic cadre. \nAs the cadre was sulking, it did not stand by the party and deserted the trenches. The coterie that had surrounded SAD chief Sukhbir Badal led to complete disconnect with the foot soldiers. Lack of an effective rapport with the cadre, the feeling of alienation grew among the Taksali Sikhs. They concluded that brokers and middleman have taken over and people with shady image and synonymous with all the ills afflicted the state -- liquor mafia, sand mafia -- and who were not traditional Akalis had made inroads into the inner circle. \nThe cadre did not stand up to defend the Akalis on the sacrilege issue that dominated the political discourse. The jathedars found themselves not heard at the high level. \nThis band of hardcore Akali voter and sulking Taksali Sikhs walked into the AAP fold. That’s the single largest reason behind erosion of vote bank and route of the Akali Dal. \nIt was this committed cadre which stood up with the Akali Dal in the past. This time they were nonchalant and decamped from their trenches. tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T10:27:09.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
