The boxes come equipped with clothes, a mattress, diapers and other baby necessities. Play Baby Boxes? How One Company Is Helping to Lower Infant Mortality Rates in U.S. 1:59  embed/896238660001\"   \nIn January, New Jersey became the first to adopt a statewide baby box program. And now, Ohio has jumped onto the baby box bandwagon, along with hospitals in Philadelphia and San Antonio, Texas. So, why are parents deciding to trade their cradles with stuffed padding for cardboard and a sheet? What's the point of a baby box? \nModeled after a program in Finland that began more than 70 years ago, baby boxes are aimed at curbing infant mortality rates. \nBaby box programs hope to promote safe sleeping practices for newborns and to decrease Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) — the abrupt death of a baby that is younger than 1. SIDS is usually attributed to sleep-related accidents such as strangulation, suffocation or entrapment. In 2015, the Center for Disease Control reported about 3,700 infants died from SIDS.

Matt Rourke / AP \nProponents of baby boxes say the combination of educational tools and free resources will bring America's infant mortality rate closer to those found in wealthy Nordic countries. \nThe U.S. saw a drastic decline in its infant mortality rate since 1994, when the CDC launched its \"Back to Sleep\" campaign urging parents to have their infants sleep on their backs rather than stomachs, but disadvantaged groups still tend to be affected by SIDS more. From 2010 to 2013 , black infants suffered SIDS at double the rate of white infants. Have baby boxes made an impact? \nIn Finland, baby boxes have had a dramatic impact. When the program launched in 1949, the government gave mothers a choice: They could either receive 140 euros or a baby box stuffed with child care products worth more than the cash. \nIn the 1930s, the country's infant mortality rate was 65 deaths per 1,000 infants. Beginning in 1949, that number has shrank to 3.5 deaths per 1,000 births. Comparatively, the United States had an infant mortality rate of about 5.8 deaths per 1,000 births in 2016 . \nThe United States' higher infant mortality rate compared to some European countries is driven \"almost entirely\" by infant deaths among lower socioeconomic groups after they leave the hospital, according to one University of Chicago study . Other factors may include poorer health insurance coverage and maternal education.

The Affordable Care Act pays for a number of similar programs, such as the Nurse Family Partnership located in New York. \nThe program , which sought to rein in infant deaths in the U.S., provides low-income, first-time mothers with registered nurses who visit their homes to provide assistance and child health education for mothers. The visits continue until the child turns 2.
