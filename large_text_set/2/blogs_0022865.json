But the 45-year-old entertainerÂ isnâ€™t done growing his family yet.\nDuring an appearance onÂ Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Wednesday, the â€œLivinâ€™ La Vida Locaâ€ singer revealed that heâ€™s planning on having more kids â€” though this time, he wants girls.\nâ€œI want a big family,â€ MartinÂ said. â€œDaddyâ€™s little girl has to come.â€\nMartin, whose sons were born via surrogacy, Â inferred that he plans to do the same thing again.Â â€œItâ€™s funny because the way we do babies, I get to choose the sex,â€ he said. â€œSo definitely girls are coming.â€\nSTAR WARS + FAMILY = BLISS \nA post shared by Jwan Yosef (@jwanyosef) on Dec 11, 2016 at 12:52am PST\nHe also said thatÂ new fiancĂŠ Jwan Yosef Â wants kids ofÂ his own too. â€œIâ€™m talking about my babies,â€ Martin said. â€œAnd then he is going to have more Â babies as well. Genetically, connection.â€\nSo would MartinÂ mind having twins again? â€œListen â€” if still we have the energy, letâ€™s do it!â€ an enthusiastic Martin said. â€œI donâ€™t have a problem. If thereâ€™s two, thereâ€™s two.â€\nIn 2008, Martin talked to PEOPLE about his decision to have his sons via surrogacy . â€œAdoption was one option, but itâ€™s complicated and can take a long time,â€ he said. â€œSurrogacy was an intriguing and faster option. I thought, â€˜Iâ€™m going to jump into this with no fear.â€™ â€\nBeing a father for Martin was something he desperately wanted â€” and he wasnâ€™t afraid to do it on his own. â€œIâ€™m so happy!â€ he said. â€œEverything they do, from smiling to crying, feels like a blessing. Being a father feels amazing. This has been the most spiritual moment in my life.â€\nMartinÂ came out in 2010 â€” two years after becoming a father and theÂ same year he began datingÂ Carlos Gonzalez Abella . The two split in 2014.\nThis time, heâ€™ll have Yosef by his side from the beginning. The coupleÂ were engaged in November, with Martin popping the question to his artist boyfriend after more than a year of dating.\nThey met in an unexpected place : Instagram.\nâ€œIâ€™m scrolling and I see this beautiful piece of art and Iâ€™m like, â€˜Whoa, how cool! Whoâ€™s this?â€™ â€ Martin toldÂ Andy Cohen Â during a SiriusXM town hall discussion onÂ Radio Andy . â€œ Then I start checking and all of a sudden Iâ€™m like, â€˜Ooh, ooh.â€™ And then I wrote to him.â€™ â€œ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:30:44.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
