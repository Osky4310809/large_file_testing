The side of a Porsche 911 GT3 R spinning in front of me. This is how wet it was before tonight’s 24 Hours of Daytona got even wetter and was yellow-flagged for heavy rain. Advertisement \nAn Audi coming down the track just narrowly missed the No. 54 CORE Autosport Porsche 911 in full-on spin mode. The rear-engine 911, which CORE runs in GTD, spun out in the 13th hour of the race. The 911 lost its rear end, at which point, it became a giant pendulum, sending the 911 spinning along the wall. \nIt’s wet out there. It’s absolutely miserable, but it certainly makes for some good photos. Here are a couple other shots from before the yellow flag—enjoy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T10:58:52.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
