C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup is arguing that we can improve code by grounding generic programming in concepts -- what's required by a template's arguments. An anonymous reader quotes Paul Krill's report on a new paper by Stroustrup : In concepts, Stroustrup sees the solution to the interface specification problem that has long dogged C++ , the language he founded more than 35 years ago. \"The way we write generic code today is simply too different from the way we write other code,\" Stroustrup says... Currently an ISO technical specification, concepts provide well-specified interfaces to templates without runtime overhead. Concepts, Stroustrup writes, are intended to complete C++'s support for generic programming as initially envisioned. \"The purpose of concepts is to fundamentally simplify and improve design. This leads to fewer bugs and clearer -- often shorter -- code\"... Concepts, Stroustrup believes, will greatly ease engineers' ability to write efficient, reliable C++ code... The most obvious effect will be a massive improvement in the quality of error messages, but the most important long-term effect will be found in the flexibility and clarity of code, Stroustrup says. \"In particular, having well-specified interfaces allows for simple, general and zero-overhead overloading of templates. That simplifies much generic code\" Concepts are already available in GNU C Compiler 6.2, and Stroustrup wants them to be included in C++ 20. \"In my opinion, concepts should have been part of C++ 17, but the committee couldn't reach consensus on that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T02:38:48.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
