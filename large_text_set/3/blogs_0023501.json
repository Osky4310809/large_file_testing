Obviously him being in that situation to have his knowledge of that can benefit us quite a lot.” \nSouthampton’s new call-up James Ward-Prowse added: “It was a very powerful message. I think obviously we want to be the best in the world. \n“We want to establish ourselves as a top team in the world. So it is all about plugging away at those goals and making sure that what we do now stands us in good stead for when we reach major tournaments.\" \nSouthgate invited 10 additional players not named in the England squad to attend the meeting - but only Stoke keeper Jack Butland turned up.
