Here is an ad the company ran in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Dec. 21, 1886. \nThe Erker family’s eyewear business, founded in 1879, has a long legacy in St. Louis, predating the Gateway Arch and 45 city mayors. It was established just 19 years after the Anheuser-Busch brewery. \nNow, Tony and Jack III, the fifth generation of Erkers, are launching a new eyewear venture, Copper Hinge , that has set its sights on competing online against innovative startups such as Warby Parker. But most important, the brothers say, is returning the family-owned eyewear business to its roots by manufacturing lenses and frames here, from a storefront in the Delmar Loop. \nBy the 1980s, imported frames had become the norm in the industry, because they could be made for less overseas. Not much has changed since. Today, the brothers said, there are only a handful of smaller manufacturers in the U.S. \n“It’s a lost craft from the U.S. that is no longer here,” said Tony Erker, 36, who’s hoping to change that with Copper Hinge. \nYears ago, the brothers began turning their hip, made-in-America concept into a reality. They were looking to cut out the middlemen overseas to sell directly to consumers online. \n“I wanted to be able to control our own destiny,” said Jack Erker III, 37. \nIn April, the men will open the door to Copper Hinge, a Delmar Loop retail store and factory where shoppers can watch their glasses being made — a nod to nearby Fitz’s where diners watch the bottling of Fitz’s root beer, said Jack Erker, a University City native. \nShoppers will be able to get an eye exam and be fitted for glasses at the Delmar store, or they can have their prescription and measurements sent in from their optometrist. \nThe retail store offers a window into the brand, but most of the sales will be conducted online . \nShoppers who go to the website will be able to browse the frame selection online and can have frames sent to them to try on at home for free. If they find a pair they like, they can have their prescription sent in. Measurements are done online using interactive technology via the website. \nIt takes about a week to make the lenses and frames, which will start at $100. \nSo far the brothers have invested $1 million and have hauled in many high-tech machines to whittle long sheets of plastic into colorful and wearable frames. Their special mark is a copper hinge, a rarity in eyewear, they say. \nThe brothers secured multiple patents to protect their frames, including the copper hinge design, which is also the inspiration for the company name. \nThe factory will also take over some of the manufacturing for Erker’s wholesale business. \nBut even though the machines make the process look easy, it’s been a long road. An improvement in technology helped make the concept a reality. Just five years ago, five machines were required to make the nose bump. Now, one does it, Jack Erker said. \nIt’s unique to have so much automation, the men said. Many of the overseas factories still rely heavily on workers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T10:27:29.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
