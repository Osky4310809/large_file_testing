The suspect then fled westbound towards Broadway. \nThe next day at around 8:25 a.m., the man approached the same victim on a Manhattan-bound Z train approaching Canal Street and rubbed his groin on her butt, police said. He then fled the subway car at Canal Street. \nPolice first released information on the incidents Feb. 28, and on Tuesday released video footage of the suspect, who they say is around 25 years old, stands at 6 feet and weighs 220 pounds. \n<br />", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:09:43.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
