We currently have 486 department managers (UK wide) and gradually between now and 2020 we expect this number to reduce by around 180.” \nIt added that the reduction would be through natural turnover, retirements and voluntary redundancies. \nThe firm also today proposed the closure of five stores across the country, including in Staines, Hertford and Palmers Green. \nWaitrose pointed out however that it is investing in new branches and its existing estate, with new jobs being created. \nThe moves come after parent company the John Lewis Partnership warned last month of a “challenging market outlook” due to the pound’s post-Referendum plunge. \nSterling’s weakness will push up prices of goods from abroad, leaving retailers and shoppers facing higher prices. \nConditions for supermarkets are already tough: competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl has forced the major grocers like Tesco and Sainsbury’s to slash prices. \nMeanwhile Aldi and Lidl have expanded premium ranges to lure more middle class customers away from Waitrose and M&S. \nSales at Waitrose stores open for more than a year fell 1% in its first half, while operating profit dropped 10.5% to £121.3 million. \nIt fared better at Christmas, with same-store sales rising 2.8%, but bosses said group trading profit remains “under pressure” due to “greater changes” in the retail sector. \nStaff were told to expect “significantly lower” bonuses for this year.
