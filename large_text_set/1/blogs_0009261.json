Many new Air Jordans drop on Saturdays, so the question is — should you celebrate the end of another week, or set a Saturday morning alarm to cop new drops before bots and resellers make it nearly impossible ? \nTo make your decision easier, Highsnobiety presents you with the most comprehensive Air Jordan release date list for 2017. We’ll update this page every time new Air Jordan release info is out, so you might want to add it this your bookmarks. \nWithout further ado, here are the biggest Air Jordan release dates coming in 2017. Air Jordan XV “Stealth” Previous Next \nFirst released in 1999, the Air Jordan 15 is one of the last pairs Michael Jordan played in professionally. The first and the last time the shoe was “retroed” was in 2007, and a decade later it hit the shelves for a third time. The Air Jordan “Stealth” 15 contains a knitted upper with black leather and black-on-black outsole. \nRelease date: January 7, 2017 Price: $190 Air Jordan XII Low “Max Orange” Previous Next \nOne of the early releases of 2017 will be the low version of Air Jordan 12, which utilizes a black suede upper combined with signature rubber from the 12 with some minor orange details. This low-top 12 will be released within the coming weeks. \nRelease date: January 14, 2017 Price: $170 Air Jordan XII “Chinese New Year” Previous Next \nThe AJ 12 CNY looks similar to the Taxi 12 , which premiered in 1996 when the Chicago Bulls won their fifth NBA championship during the 96-97 season. The shoe will have a reflective upper with minor wooden details and is expected to be available during Chinese New Year. Head here for more pictures. \nRelease date: January 28, 2017 Price: $220 Previous Next \nOriginally designed by the legendary Tinker Hatfield , a never-seen-before colorway is expected to drop somewhere in the first quarter of 2017. The shoe will feature a black suede upper with black-and-white midsole. In addition, “Royalty” 4s are given golden eyelets with a shiny Jumpman logo. \nRelease date: February 5, 2017 Price: $190 Air Jordan VIII “Take Flight” Previous Next \nInitially, this shoe was rumored to be the second collaboration between Jordan Brand and Los Angeles-based brand Undefeated, due to familiar colors known from the notorious UNDFTD 4. The “Take Flight” 8 uses a similar set of colors — sequoia and bright orange. The sneaker is expected to drop at the end of January.

Keep your eye out for further news, as we’re expecting it to be announced via official Air Jordan and OVO channels. \nRelease date: February 11, 2017 Price: $225 Air Jordan V Premium “Take Flight” Previous Next \nThe first 2017 release of Air Jordan’s “Premium” line of retro sneakers will be decorated with Vachetta Tan and features icy soles. The “Take Flight” line was inspired by the colors of military bomber jackets and would pair well with them. The Premium 5 is dropping in February and won’t come cheap. \nRelease date: February 11, 2017 Price: $400 Air Jordan XIII “White Red”/“Chicago Bulls” Previous Next \nPreviously released in 2010 and premiered during the 1997-1998 NBA season, the Original 13 is set to hit stores on February 18 for a price tag of $190. This shoe isn’t so different from previous releases and will have a white leather upper with red suede detailing and black outsoles. \nRelease date: February 18, 2017 Price: $190 Previous Next \nSet to drop on February 16, this remarkable colorway, which was nicknamed “Chameleon”, can change colors depending on the lighting and conditions they’re worn in, similar to the Lance Mountain 1. The shoe was manufactured with an iridescent upper, black midsole and icy/black outsole. The price is slightly higher than that of the usual release, which is estimated at $225. \nRelease date: February 16, 2017 Price: $225 Previous Next \nAs an extension to the “Hare” colorway, this sneaker will look similar to the previously released “Alternative” model, with a white leather and suede upper combined with white outsole. The “Hare” 6 will be decorated with a red tongue that has “1991” stitched on, plus a red sock liner. It is rumored to hit shelves on March 11 for $190. We expect the release date could change, though. \nRelease date: March 11, 2017 Price: $190 Air Jordan XI Low “UNC” Previous Next \nThis is the return of the low 11 which was originally released back in 2001. The shoe utilizes the colors of His Airness’s Alma Mater — the University of North Carolina. Unlike most 11s, the upper will use patent leather instead of mesh, complemented with icy soles. The release date has not been announced, but this shoe is rumored to drop sometime this summer.
