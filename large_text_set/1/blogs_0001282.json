Words are hard sometimes. “Mezcal,” for example. It sure sounds a whole lot like “mescaline,” a favorite hallucinogen of Phish fans and Hunter S. Thompson. But this isn’t bat country. Despite what some people might think , mezcal has nothing to do with mescaline. That doesn’t mean mezcal doesn’t offer its own special kind of trip, one that sounds mighty good right about now as we barrel into winter. RECIPE: Saint Fiacre Cocktail This mezcal cocktail, from Gabriel Richter of GG’s , bridges the Old and New Worlds, taking inspiration from the patron saint of gardening but employing a judicious amount of Oaxacan firewater. Richter calls it the Saint Fiacre. First, make some thyme-infused honey syrup, which should take you all of five minutes. Then mix that with some agave-forward mezcal, lime juice, and Gran Classico Bitter. Garnish with some herbs, if they’ve survived the winter thus far. After a couple of these, you may find yourself slathering your body in sunscreen and dragging your boombox out to the stoop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:58:06.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
