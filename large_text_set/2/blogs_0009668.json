Harish V Nair | Posted by Neha Vashishth Government bans news on private FM radio channels. Highlights Government justifies ban on broadcasting news on private FM radio services. 2 It says news on private FM radio services can cause a threat to national security. 3 Radio stations may be exploited by radical organisations and might not be able to afford authentic news sources. \nIn the internet age when information flows freely, the government wants to continue its monopoly on news and current affairs programmes over radio waves and has justified its ban on private FM community radio service operators by saying they could threaten \"national security.\" \nIn an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Centre said it could not grant permission for broadcast of news content as several anti-national radical elements within the country and also from abroad could misuse it for propagating their agenda. \nThe apex court is hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the NGO Common Cause in 2013, seeking a direction to the Centre to allow private radio stations and community radios to broadcast news, arguing that radio is a more accessible medium for the masses, particularly the poor. \nThe petition states that India is the only democracy where the dissemination of news and current affairs programmes on radio remains a monopoly of the Government-owned broadcaster. But the MHA affidavit, in its affidavit continues to maintain its stance that community radio service operators and private FM operators should not be allowed to broadcast news. \"Broadcast of news by these stations/channel may pose a possible security risk as there is no mechanism to monitor the contents of the news bulletins of very such station,\" an filed in the court said. \n\"All these stations, channels are run mainly by NGO/other small organisations and private operators, several anti-national radical elements within the country can misuse it for propagating their own agenda,\" the affidavit stated. \"Community radio stations also air programmes involving chats with NRIs and local population settled abroad. \nAlso Read: Upset over frivolous petitions piling up in Supreme Court, CJI imposes fines \nThese stations may be exploited by foreign / radical organisations to broadcast radical views of some of these NRIs, as due to paucity of funds, the radio stations would not be able to afford authentic news sources,\" it added. Prashant Bhushan, the NGO's lawyer, had argued that not everyone can afford to open a private TV channel, but people can open community radio stations and FM stations. \nHolding that broadcasting of news bulletins and current affairs programmes on radio are at present \"the exclusive preserve of AIR and are outside the ambit of private FM radio stations\", the MHA said in case of a policy departure, there are several pitfalls to guard against, bearing in mind the sensitive nature of such broadcast. \"It is believed that news and current affairs, with their inherent capability to manipulate the minds of the people have been advisedly kept beyond the limits of private radio stations. \nAny shift in this policy would necessitate to an adherence to a rigorous code of conduct; a proper monitoring mechanism and penal provisions of violation of such a broadcast code,\" said the MHA. Common Cause, the NGO, contended that the government's policy guidelines were illegal and violative of Article 19 (1) (a) (right to free speech and expression) of the Constitution and challenged their validity.
