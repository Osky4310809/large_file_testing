Close share panel Image caption Mr Ashenden said he wanted to be free to criticise Anglican attempts to reach out to Islam One of the Queen's chaplains has resigned after a row about reading from the Koran in a Glasgow church. \nThe Reverend Gavin Ashenden, a senior clergyman in the Church of England, left his position as chaplain in order to be free to criticise the move. \nA passage from the Koran was read during an Epiphany service at St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow earlier this month. \nMr Ashenden said the reading had caused \"serious offence\". \nThe cathedral has said it is standing by its decision. \nSt Mary's invited local Muslims, who also revere Jesus as a prophet, to join the service. \nA student, Madinah Javed, read from the lectern in Arabic from the chapter of Maryam, or Mary. \nThe chapter tells the story of the birth of Christ to the virgin Mary, and includes the Islamic teaching that Jesus is not the son of God and should not be worshipped.
