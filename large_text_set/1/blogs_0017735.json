Worth noting: Nelly did end the year as Billboard ’s No. 1 overall artist once (2002), while Drake’s best finish thus far has been No. 3 overall (2016). \nThe Hot 100 \nChart debut: No. 100, April 2000, “(Hot S**t) Country Grammar” \n[embedded content] \nSongs that reached the Top 40: 19 \nSongs that reached the Top 10: 14 \nNo. 1s: Four — they are: \n“Hot in Herre” (seven weeks; 2002) \n[embedded content] \n“Dilemma,” featuring Kelly Rowland (10 weeks; 2002) —“Dilemma” replaced “Hot In Herre” at No. 1, making the summer of 2002 all Nelly, all the time. \n[embedded content] \n“Shake Ya Tailfeather” with P.
