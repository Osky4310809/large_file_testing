With under 14 seconds to go, Kentucky had the ball down 3. The play that head coach John Calipari chose to run, though, had an eery similarity to the arguably the toughest moment of Calipari's career. And it worked. NEVER CHANGE, MARCH. pic.twitter.com/1H4aiOLXYG — CBS Sports (@CBSSports) March 26, 2017 \nThat play is what Kansas head coach Bill Self calls \"Chop,\" and it broke into the mainstream during the 2008 national title game. Look familiar? \nOn Sunday, Isaiah Briscoe played the role of Sherron Collins, and Malik Monk was Mario Chalmers. They ran literally the same play to the same side and got the same result - an incredible game-tying 3. \nHad North Carolina's Luke Maye not hit that winning jumper with .3 seconds remaining, we would all be discussing how Calipari brilliantly turned a play that has haunted him for years into a ticket to the Final Four. \nIt nearly worked out that way … until it didn't.
