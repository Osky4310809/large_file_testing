Upon divorce, those assets — including real estate, dependent children, income, cars, furniture, stocks, and retirement accounts — get divided between the former spouses.\nDepending on the state you reside in, there are two ways your assets could be divided:\n1. Community property : Marital assets — and debts incurred by either spouse during the marriage — are divided 50/50. However, separate property (anything held in only one spouse's name, including property owned before marriage, given as a gift, or inherited) is not taken into account. The states that observe this law are Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Residents of Alaska can opt-in to a community property agreement.\n2. Equitable distribution : Marital assets (not including separate property)  are divided \"fairly\" at a judge's discretion , taking into account each person's earning potential or income, financial needs, and personal assets.\nTo protect personal assets in either case, couples can set up a prenuptial agreement , which establishes terms for a division of assets in the event of a divorce.\nCheck the map above to find out if the state you live in observes equitable distribution or community property law.\nNOW WATCH: The 15 most expensive ZIP codes in America \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T19:02:47.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
