Sadness, yes. Shame, maybe. Or anger that in rich, so-called “modern” Britain, such a thing needs to exist. But when I spoke to Jane – a volunteer at a central London food bank – in December, it felt like a bit of hope peering out amid the dark. \nThings weren’t easy for Jane. Made redundant a year ago, she’d lost a job in journalism that she loved and was struggling to find paid work. But like many of the people I met last year – from Claire, a mum of three funding food parcels for families at her children’s school, to Louise, an ex-teacher running a clothes bank out of a local church – Jane was giving up her time to help strangers who are struggling. Politics may be nasty. Yet courage and humour abounds in people like John | Aditya Chakrabortty Read more \nLook hard enough and that sort of solidarity is all around us. Take food banks. Many of Jane’s fellow volunteers had previously used the service themselves and wanted to give something back. Each week, a Citizens Advice volunteer comes in to help those needing a food parcel get back on their feet: filling in benefit forms or checking eviction notices. A few days after the Guardian published the article about her, Jane emailed me, overwhelmed: they’d received donations of almost £6,000. \nThese are in many ways grim times, where the most basic dignities – regular meals or a secure home for your kids – are too often out of reach. And with each government cut and wage squeeze over recent years has come a gnawing fear that as a society – divided, scared, selfish – we’re turning in on ourselves. Or worse, against each other. Right now, I think it’s easy to feel that anyone suffering is essentially out on their own. \nBut time and time again, I’m struck by how ordinary people choose to come together – and the incredible good that it does. I’ve seen grassroots campaigns across the UK such as Sisters Uncut fight for long-term funding for domestic violence survivors. And Disabled People Against Cuts – a group that started as just a handful of disabled people – persuading the United Nations to investigate the government’s disability cuts . What is giving you hope for 2017? | Sarah Marsh Read more \nI’m in awe of community groups rallying with their time and donations, from TheBusShelterMK in Milton Keynes trying to raise £30,000 to convert a double decker into a shelter for homeless people, to the Biscuit Fund – anonymous “gifters” who scan benefit forums to find families who need help – giving more than £50,000 for anything from freezers to food hampers. \nI am inspired by the trade unions starting the year defending decent pay, job security, and workers’ rights post-Brexit. Or the pro bono lawyers overturning social care cuts and the law students winning disabled people’s “fit for work” appeals . \n  fight as hard to survive as so many in this country currently do. But I find hope in seeing that any struggle gets easier when we stand beside each other. Let’s take on 2017 together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T14:08:32.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
