Angelina Jolie (Photo: Getty) \n\"Every government must balance the needs of its citizens with its international responsibilities. But our response must be measured and should be based on facts, not fear.\" \n\"It is simply not true that our borders are overrun or that refugees are admitted to the United States without close scrutiny,\" Jolie added. \nShe went on, \"If we create a tier of second-class refugees, implying Muslims are less worthy of protection, we fuel extremism abroad, and at home we undermine the ideal of diversity cherished by Democrats and Republicans alike: 'America is committed to the world because so much of the world is inside America,' in the words of Ronald Reagan.\" Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras with Angelina Jolie (Photo: Rex Features) Angelina Jolie and kids, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, and Maddox seen at LAX airport in Los Angeles, California.
