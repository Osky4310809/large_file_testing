We can’t tune out for a split second, or we may lose more than we can afford to bear Thursday 19 January 2017 10:42 BST Click to followThe Independent Online The stage is prepared ahead of the presidential inauguration at the US Capitol in Washington DC Getty Images \nThis is it. After weeks of bitter anger, boundless sorrow and relentless fear, rhyme and reason have finally come to a screeching halt just outside of the Oval Office. On Friday, Donald Trump’s gaudy inauguration performance will blot out the sun and confiscate every last second of broadcast airtime on the planet. It doesn’t matter who you are, where you’re from or how little you care, you won’t be able to escape the rise of The Donald and his gilded, artificially country-infused sideshow of self-gratification. \nAnd that’s quite right. You shouldn’t be allowed to. \nNobody in their right mind wants to watch Trump be handed the keys to the castle. Hollywood has chosen to shun what’s normally considered an extraordinary celebrity occasion; Democrats are boycotting it by the boatload; half your friends are probably plotting social media blackouts, while liberal activists are preparing counter events and demonstrations in increasingly desperate acts of resistance. \nYou can hardly blame them. Throughout Trump’s unlikely rise to power, he’s shamelessly and condescendingly scoffed at the common man at every turn. He’s mocked the disabled , belittled women, turned his back on minorities, refused to denounce political violence and promised to build every barrier imaginable .

Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images \nNever has a single man claiming to represent America been so woefully ignorant of its patchwork composition – and never has an incoming president suffered such a depressingly low approval rating. \nTrump appears as a comic book villain, a wannabe autocrat with selfish delusions of grandeur. He doesn’t care about you, me or America. Inauguration day hasn’t even come yet, and already Trump has redefined nepotism in its most literal sense: he’s handed family members unaccountable roles of power, refused to divest from dodgy dealings and done what he can to silence the free press. \nThus far, America has answered Trump’s increasingly frequent acts of betrayal with complete apathy and disinterest. Most of us just want to tune out and get on with our lives. Many Americans are politically and emotionally exhausted. They need a break. \nBut if the last few weeks have provided us with even the faintest whiff of the horrific stench that’s about to float in after inauguration day, we can’t afford to take a break. We can’t tune out for a split second, or we may lose more than we can afford to bear. CIA Director John Brennan has stern warning for Donald Trump \nLive in denial all you want, but democracy is far more fragile than any of us should care to admit. The western world loves to flaunt its constitutions and parliamentary procedures and pretend they’re iron-clad bastions of freedom. But the truth is, it only takes the tiniest of cracks to bring a towering democracy crashing down to its knees. Time and time again, fear, apathy and our misplaced faith in pomp and circumstance have enabled fascism, autocracy and war. As a queer woman I will be marching against Donald Trump this weekend \nLet’s not bother naming any obvious 20th century examples, because we don’t want to give Trump more credit than he deserves. But the point is this: if left unchecked, the wrong man or woman can twist and distort even the most complex system to achieve their own selfish ends. \nIf you treasure even one thing about America, it’s your civic duty to scrutinise those all those in power and ensure they can’t afford to pass a kidney stone without getting some hassle about it. \nLike it or not, Donald Trump is now the man looking to twist and distort that system. You’ve got to be wide awake on inauguration day. If you refuse to get involved now, we may all live to regret it later.
