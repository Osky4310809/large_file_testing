For her first appearance at the music awards show, the actress, who will be presenting, wore a tea-length, black leather, one-shoulder dress. But here’s the catch—the sides were held together with dozens of tiny little silver chains—that is, not stitches, not thread—exposing wide swaths of her skin down either side of her body. (Not unlike the dress Chrissy Teigen wore to the American Music Awards back in November, although that one was held together with only a single gold safety pin.) \"This is my skin by the way,\" the star told E! News host Giuliana Rancic. \"It’s not mesh. This is all Laverne.\" It’s always empowering to feel proud of your body—but we’re guessing for the transgender actress, this statement of self was even more profoundly meaningful. When your dress (and your body) look that good, you could wear a paper bag on your head and still slay the red carpet, but Cox’s hair and makeup were equally memorable: She paired a self-described “snatched-back” ponytail with green and graphic eye shadow dotted with twinkly sequins. \"I’m really trying to do things I haven’t done before,\" she went on. Cox also reported that her longtime makeup artist Deja Davenport came ready with three different sketches as inspiration for her eye makeup; the two worked together to select the final result. (It's clear they make a fantastic team.) You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:46:24.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
