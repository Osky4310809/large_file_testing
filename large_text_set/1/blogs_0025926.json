(Getty) \nDonald Trump’s family has been thrust into the political spotlight. The family has been scrutinized by the media for years, but now they could become the first family. \nDuring Tuesday night’s Republican National Convention, his son Donald Trump Jr. and daughter Tiffany took the stage to speak about their father, and the values he instilled in them. \nTrump is often photographed with his five children, and his wife, Melania . Trump, 70, has two prior marriages, which have also been brought back into the public eye–his first to Ivana in 1977, and then Marla Maples in 1993. \nHere’s what you need to know about Ivana Trump: 1. Ivana Was Married to Trump for 14 Years Donald Trump and Ivana arrive at a social engagement in New York in 1989. (Getty) \nThe Czechoslovakian-born former model met Donald Trump in New York. On April 7, 1977 the two married, when Ivana was 28. The couple quickly became prominent figures in New York society in the 1980s. \nDuring their marriage, Trump had an affair with Marla Maples, which splashed tabloid headlines . Ivana filed for divorce in 1991. \nIvana settled her divorce from Donald for a reported $14 million cash settlement, an apartment at Trump Plaza, the family’s 45-room Connecticut estate, and access to Mar-a-Lago, the family home in Palm Beach, Florida, that also serves as a private club for the Palm Beach elite, according to Vanity Fair. \nIvana was later sued by Trump for violating a gag order from their divorce. However, now she says her and her ex-husband are on good terms. \nIvana told the Post that she even advises her ex-husband at times . “I suggest a few things,” she told the paper. “We speak before and after the appearances and he asks me what I thought.” According to the Post, Ivana tells her husband to “be more calm,” although she says “Donald cannot be calm.” \n“He’s very outspoken. He just says it as it is … He’s no politician. He’s a businessman. He knows how to talk. He can give an hour speech without notes.” \nIn the article, Ivana says she agrees with Trump’s immigration policies. “And I’m an immigrant,” Ivana stated. \nShe also spoke to the Post about the possibility of Trump’s wife Melania, becoming First Lady. \n“She’s going to adapt just fine,” she said to the Post. “She never did anything wrong to me. I wish them all the best.” \nFollowing her divorce from Trump, Ivana has also had two other marriages. She wed Riccardo Mazzucchelli in 1995, but their marriage ended two years later. Then in 2008, she married Rossano Rubicondi– the two separated shortly after. \nShe now has three boyfriends and has no intention to re-marry, according to the Post : \nIf you are a married woman, you usually follow what the man wants to do. I can do whatever what I want. I’m not getting married again. But I like companions. The most important for me is honesty, good humor — not necessarily a millionaire. I don’t need [money]. I prefer to be a baby sitter than a nursemaid. I don’t want to worry about bad knees and bad back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T07:29:40.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
