Sanders Supporter Sues James Woods Over Twitter Mis-Identification \nNews of the resignation letters comes just three months after a round of post-election layoffs at the DNC had reduced staffing to below-normal levels. \nWhile the moves may suggest a party organization in disarray, Perez spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said it was simply part of a leadership transition. “This is longstanding precedent at the DNC and has happened during multiple Chair transitions,” Hinojosa said. “The process was started before the election of the new Chair. From the beginning, Tom has been adamant that we structure the DNC for future campaigns. Current and future DNC staff will be integral to that effort. Over the last few months, the DNC staff has done incredible work under immense pressure to hold Trump accountable.” CNN reports the move by Perez will allow him to make “structural changes at the DNC that many party members consider overdue. Perez, who defeated Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison in February for the DNC leadership post, announced he’d tasked a 30-member transition committee to advise him on all aspects of that transition, including staffing. Perez himself has been called an establishment pick by some onlookers, which could make for an interesting party realignment. Perez had the support of former president Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, while former vice president Joe Biden supported Ellison. The DNC suffered no shortage of turmoil during the 2016 election, with the widely publicized hacks of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, the controversy surrounding the alleged collusion with Hillary Clinton’s campaign against the Bernie Sanders campaign by Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Donna Brazile, and, of course, the stunning defeat to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Perez becomes the third DNC chair in the past nine months. He faces the task of rebuilding not only the party’s platform but also its donor base. \n“I wouldn’t wish that (job) on anybody,” California Gov. Jerry Brown said Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. “I was the Democratic Party chairman in California — it’s a miserable job. So, Tom, too bad.”   In April, the DNC’s unity commission will begin work on restructuring the nominating process in addition to reassessing mistakes and shortcomings during the election that led to a divide between various factions in the party and the loss to Trump in the general election.
