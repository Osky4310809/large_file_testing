On January 21, 2017, we saw people come together in women’s marches around the world. Some protesters faced blizzards , while others were surrounded by tropical weather and greenery. But all were united by a shared message – and a lot of posters of Carrie Fisher . \nWe really can’t get over the crowd sizes of the women’s marches around the world. Seeing so many people come together this way gives us hope for the next four years. The women’s marches around the world tell us that we’re not alone in this fight. The world sees what’s happening, and they’re not going to let us go it alone. \n(By the way, when we say women’s marches around the world, we really do mean everywhere.

If our neighbors to the south are capable of showing this kind of fortitude and love after decades of corrupted individuals have held the highest office in their country, I have a feeling we can make it through the next four years, if it comes to that.
