Ocean Dream \nTransport yourself to a dream-like world with this gorgeous illustration This beautiful book illustration is part of a series for a picture book by Vietnamese illustrator Khoa Le . The imagery instantly transports you to a dream-like world, using bright, shining colours to show the contrast of light and shadow. Le also executes the under/above water juxtaposition perfectly.\n02. Hawa'a \nHawa'a is a brother-sister collaboration This is the first children&apos;s book from London-based illustrator Fx Goby and with his sister, writer Valentine Goby.

His work regularly features weird and wonderful creatures, and we can&apos;t get enough of them.\n04. Puss Jekyll, Cat Hyde \nA picture purrfect book illustration from Jill Barton Using graphite pencil and watercolour wash, illustrator Jill Barton created these purrfect images for a book entitled Puss Jekyll, Cat Hyde.

It&apos;s instantly eye-catching and references aspects of the book using clever imagery and beautiful colour work.\n06. Where the Wild Things are \nMaurice Sendak was not only a talented author but an incredible artist Where the Wild Things are is one of the most well-known and best loved children&apos;s stories, and it&apos;s appreciated as much for its illustrations as its narrative, both of which were created by the late Maurice Sendak .\nThe talented creative not only had the gift of words but of images too. And he put both to good use in this classic book. Sendak&apos;s attention to detail is apparent in the millions of tiny ink lines he added to show the hairs on the Wild Things.\n07. The Arrival \nIt's not difficult to see how Shaun Tan's The Arrival won Book of the Year as part of the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards back in 2006 Australian illustrator and author Shaun Tan is the man behind this incredibly detailed graphic novel. The Arrival tells the story of an immigrant who leaves his home in search of a better life for family purely through pictures.\nWe don&apos;t even want to think long it must have taken Tan to draw just one of these intricate illustrations, let alone the entire book. The combination of photorealistic humans in various abstract environments shows off the true extent of his talents.\n08. The Enormous Crocodile \nIt's hard not to love the distinctive style and humour of Blake's illustrations With so many to choose from, it was hard to pick just one of English author and artist Quentin Blake&apos;s genius illustrations. But in the end we opted for the gorgeous images that feature in Roald Dahl&apos;s The Enormous Crocodile.\nThis beautiful picture book was the first that Dahl and Blake collaborated on in the mid 70s. The duo went on to work together for many years, with Blake&apos;s distinctive art helping to bring Dahl&apos;s much-loved characters to life.\n09. Sylvester and the New Year \nSylvester and the New Year is illustrator Emmeline Pidgen's second picture book This gorgeous artwork comes from award-winning illustrator Emmeline Pidgen &apos;s second picture book, Silvester and the New Year. Due to short deadlines, Pidgen has had to adapt her working approach.\n\"Whereas I used to work mostly with gouache paints and traditional media, I&apos;ve pushed myself further into using digital means to complete my work,\" Pidgen comments. \"I do always try to keep that sense of the handmade by using photographed textures, paintbrush splat stamps and such in the pages.\"\n10. The Snowman \nNow a classic, The Snowman was created by author and illustrator Raymond Briggs Loved by adults and children alike, The Snowman was illustrated by critically acclaimed British artist Raymond Briggs. First published in 1978, Briggs created the picture book images using pencil crayons.\nIn an interview with the Guardian , Briggs commented, \"The usual method is to draw in pencil, then &apos;ink it in&apos;, then colour it. But the inked line is always deader than the pencil line. The feeling has gone out of it. Using pencil crayon, these three stages can merge together. You can draw lightly in colour, then gradually make it sharper, clearer and darker, while colouring it at the same time. Furthermore, for this book, crayon has a softer quality, ideally suited to snow.\"\n11. Joseph-Armand Bombardier \nJacqui Lee mainly uses inks and watercolours to create her illustrations Jacqui Lee is a freelance illustrator based in Calgary, Alberta. This beautiful image is from her children&apos;s book, The Story of Joseph-Armand Bombardier, is about the Canadian inventor who pioneered the development of the snowmobile.\nUsing inks and watercolours to create her clean and minimal illustrations, Lee&apos;s distinctive style is gorgeous and fits very well with the theme of her book.\n12.

Snow White and the Fox \nThis is just one of many gorgeous graphic illustrations by artist Niroot Puttapipat Black and white, with just a tiny hint of colour, this detailed illustration was drawn by artist Niroot Puttapipat for a book on Russian myths.\nPuttapipat comments on his Deviant Art portfolio: \"This tale is one of the rarer instances in which a fox plays a benevolent role, rather than an antagonistic one. The &apos;Snow White&apos; of this tale bears no relation to the more famous one of the poisoned apple from the Brothers Grimm.\" Puttapipat used ink and gouache on hot pressed watercolour paper to create the scene.\n18. A Happy Pair \nPeter Rabbit wasn't the first bunny that Beatrix Potter created This rather beautiful pair of bunnies were illustrated by none other than Beatrix Potter.
