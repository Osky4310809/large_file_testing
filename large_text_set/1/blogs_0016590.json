Kylie Jenner has been known to don designer sports bras, and Gigi Hadid is constantly being photographed in leggings. And alongside these celebs, Younger actress, Hilary Duff, is hopping on the activewear bandwagon. Yesterday, Duff wore a pair of oxblood leggings that are not only on trend, but also ~scientifically~ the perfect workout color.\nDuff paired her two-toned leggings with a black and white letterman jacket and black baseball cap. The overall look screams sporty badass and Duff looks like the tough girl who plays for the rival team in a teen powderpuff football movie.\nNow that we think about it, that sounds like a great movie idea. Hilary, are you busy right now? Getty Images / Oswaldo/Bauer-Griffin Anyway, oxblood is a color that always comes back in fashion in the fall. The dark-toned red compliments the oranges, browns, and dark greens that make up the autumn palette. It’s deep and warm and it reminds us of our fave red wine that we sip on chilly nights in front of the fire.\nGetty Images / Oswaldo/Bauer-Griffin But, whether Duff intentionally wore her oxblood leggings to the gym or not, oxblood is a perfect workout color. According to ColorPsychology.org, red is associated with energy, aggression, strength, power and determination — all things needed for a fruitful leg day.\nThe website states, “Red has an effect on our physiological state, since it increases heart rate and makes us breathe faster…It has been found that athletes wearing a red kit in combat sports had a bigger chance of winning than those who wore a blue kit. Red makes the person feel more aggressive and more powerful, boosting testosterone, but it also changes the perception others have.” Getty Images / BG015/Bauer-Griffin So not only will oxblood make you the trendiest person at the gym, but you almost might find yourself getting more out of your workout while wearing it. Is Hilary Duff a genius? Absolutely — but we already knew that.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:51:55.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
