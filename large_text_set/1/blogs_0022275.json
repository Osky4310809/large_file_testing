The content is largely the same as well, but this exclusive interview with Chelsea favorite Joe Cole is a step above the usual fare. Several steps, probably, as it's quite wonderful. \nIt's a little over 15 minutes long, but it's well worth your time. \nJoey talks a bit about his time training at Cobham recently while preparing for the new USL season with the Tampa Bay Rowdies, about his impressions of Conte, his high hopes for Chelsea this season and Eden Hazard (with whom he played for a season at Lille) in particular (best ever at Chelsea?), and his own future in coaching. \nThen, in the bit more informal second part of the interview, he tells a couple funny stories of being late and hungover for his first Chelsea trophy parade, playing pranks in the dressing room, and celebrating his goal against Manchester United in the FA Cup. \nAnd then there are of course all the stories of Billy, the legend. \nAnyway, gotta love Joey Cole!
