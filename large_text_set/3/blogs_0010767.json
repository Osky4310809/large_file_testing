Meddler noted they were not intentional]  \n\nNotes Below are a few notes and posts relating to current PBE content in 7.6 cycle. Remember that we have a few previously discussed balance change heading to PBE soon and recolors for Hextech/Enchanted Galio VFX.\n\n1) Solcrushed provided a changelist for and context on today's Galio changes in the PBE Galio Feedback thread. \n\"Tank Galio looks to be out of line both damage and durability wise, draining power out of the base numbers and putting them back to AP ratios and Q. Full tank passive damage will drop significantly while builds that feature some AP should be affected less.\" \n2)  Meddler noting in most recent   quick gameplay thoughts   that Knight's Vow PBE revert is not intentional:\n\" Aatrox hotfix    All going according to plan we should be putting out a balance hotfix for Aatrox today. We concluded he was definitely in too poor a state to leave until the next regular patch and wasn't likely to recover enough just based off relearning. Changes include increased starting health (580, was 537 and had been kept low historically because of the impact of the previous revive in lane), Q CD down (13-11, was 16-12) and W damage up (45-185, was 30-150). Suspect it's likely we'll also make Aatrox changes in 7.6, though we'll need to see where these put him first of course. \" and\n\" Knight's Vow on PBE  We saw some reports yesterday that Knight's Vow had been reverted to its older stats and build path on the PBE yesterday. Going to be looking into that today, it's not an intended change so it's either a datamining error or we've accidentally stomped the newer version with an old file somehow.\"\n\nCheck out  [ THIS PAGE ]  for a  comprehensive list of the new content & changes currently on the PBE as a part of this cycle  or catch up with the individual update links below !\n3/7 PBE Update: Galio champion update, new Alistar, Kennen, Kog'Maw, and Renekton skins, new chroma, and more! 3/8 PBE Update: New Skin Splash Art, New icons, & more! 3/9 PBE Update: More Tentative Balance Changes [ BACK TO TOP ] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:12:41.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
