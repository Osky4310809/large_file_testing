But it’s another team, Miami – currently in the 10th spot, but riding a 13-game winning streak – that Van Gundy considers as good as in. \n“It’s been a year where there’s a lot of mediocre teams,” Van Gundy said of the East, where a whopping seven teams, the Pistons included, have a point differential that falls in the narrow band between plus-0.5 and minus-0.9. “Miami is very quickly climbing out of that, though. They’re not a mediocre team. You’ve got to look at them almost as a sure-fire playoff team. And it’s starting to get down to where there’s not a lot of spots left. So you’re going to have to start playing well.” \nThe Pistons, 25-29 and with a differential of minus-0.4, have three games before next week’s All-Star break, including a Sunday-Monday back to back at Toronto and Milwaukee. The Bucks – who had a good news-bad news week when they got Khris Middleton back off a hamstring injury that had sidelined him all season but lost Jabari Parker to his second torn ACL – are currently in the 11th spot in the East but with the same differential (minus-0.3) as Atlanta, which is six spots ahead of them in the standings. The Hawks are eight games over .500, the Bucks eight games under. \nPoint differential has been a reliable indicator of a team’s record over the course of 82 games. Last season the eight teams that finished with a positive differential in the East were the eight that played in the postseason. Van Gundy thinks differential is no longer a reliable forecaster, at least for teams hovering around .500 – and he has a theory as to why. \n“The point-differential thing, especially for the middling teams, might not be as predictive as it has been in the past, only because I think the 3-point shooting has really skewed things. You see a lot more blowouts both ways. If a team gets it going from three, you can see these 20-point blowouts.” \nClose games for 42 or 45 minutes wind up with 15-point final margins more often than not in today’s game, which has seen a 50 percent jump in the number of 3-point attempts over six years ago. \nThe Pistons went through a 15-game stretch where they went 4-11 largely because teams shot 45 percent from the 3-point line against them. That was 30th in the NBA. They’re 7-5 in their last 12 games with opponents shooting 32 percent from the arc, the fifth best mark over that time. Van Gundy doesn’t think his team had much influence on the numbers during either stretch. \n“As far as the 3-point shooting, when I watch it I just don’t see a lot of difference,” he said. “I think you can limit the number of open threes people get, but that stayed pretty consistent with us, too.” \nWhat he would like to influence over the final 28 games is more 3-point attempts by his offense. Primarily, the boost would come from his three forwards: Marcus Morris, Tobias Harris and Jon Leuer. Van Gundy huddled with them at center court of the team’s practice facility when Saturday’s practice ended. \nLeuer passed up an open corner 3-point attempt – the most desired shot other than a dunk or layup in today’s game – to pass to Ish Smith on the wing, who drained a longer triple in Friday’s loss to San Antonio. \n“Right now our shot distribution is not really conducive to being a great offensive team,” Van Gundy said. “We’re trying to change that. We’re trying to get more cutting, more ball movement to open up stuff at the rim and we’re really encouraging – especially our three forwards that play a lot – to quit passing up open looks at the three. About the only guy we’ve got that’s a volume 3-point shooter is (Kentavious Caldwell-Pope). We need a little bit more with that.” \nThe margin between fifth place and 11th in the East is razor thin. If Van Gundy successfully coaxes a few more 3-point attempts out of the Pistons over the season’s final 28 games – and gets a little help from the gods in holding opponents a little closer to 32 percent than 45 percent accuracy from the arc – the Pistons might just wind up on the right side of the line for a second straight season.
