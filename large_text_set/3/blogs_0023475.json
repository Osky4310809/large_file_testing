Still, there are protests going on, this time by a group of taxi drivers outside Parliament yesterday. \nAccording to The Star , the group of about 50 gathered some 200 metres from the Parliament guardhouse in the morning, carrying placards and chanting slogans opposing Uber and Grab (image above is a file pic). They also submitted a memorandum to several opposition MPs who met them, including Pokok Sena MP Datuk Mahfuz Omar, Bukit Gantang MP Idris Ahmad and Pandan MP Rafizi Ramli. \nBlowing the same old horn, the group claimed that the ride-hailing services were flouting the law and carrying out “illegal activities”. \n“Uber and GrabCar must be subjected to the same laws and regulations as taxi drivers. Only then can we accept them. We are here today because we want our MPs, whom we have chosen through the ballot box, to meet us and ask us what is really happening on the ground,” said group spokesman Zailani Sausudin, who is the chairman of the Klang Valley Taxi Drivers Action Group. \n“Taxi drivers all over Malaysia are facing many difficulties right now. We cannot pay rent, we have no source of income and are unable to support our families or pay for our children’s education. What is happening?” he added. \nPAS MP Mahfuz said the government must find a solution “once and for all” to assist taxi drivers, whom he said were being marginalised. He said while there’s nothing wrong with services from Uber and Grab, the legal procedures that cabbies have to abide by should also apply to drivers from the other side. \n“There are already so many taxis out there, so if the government wishes to allow Uber and GrabCar, then I think taxi services should be terminated and existing drivers should be allowed to use their own vehicles to ferry passengers,” he said.
