(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \nThe United States Secret Service requested an additional $60 million for next year to handle the increased costs of protecting President Donald Trump and his family. \nAccording to documents reviewed by The Washington Post , the agency requested $26.8 million for \"residence security operations at the president's private residence in Trump tower,\" with $12.5 million specifically earmarked for \"personnel related costs in New York.\" \nThe agency also requested $33 million request to cover travel-protection expenses that are \"extremely variable, difficult to predict and difficult to plan for in advance as many protectees' travel plans are unknown with limited time to prepare,\" on top of the $74 million already in the fiscal 2018 budget. \nThe costs come from the Secret Service's duty to protect not just Trump, but his wife and youngest son, living full time at Trump Tower in Manhattan; his adult children , including his sons, who travel internationally on behalf of the Trump Organization; and his grandchildren. \nThe agency also asked for the equivalent of six additional full-time positions.

When just first lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump are in residence, police told The Post, the cost drops to between $127,000 and $145,000 a day. \nPalm Beach County sheriff's officials, meanwhile, say protecting Mar-a-Lago has racked up a price tag of $1.5 million in overtime, and the city says it may levy higher fees on the club to avoid raising taxes on other city residents to meet the cost. \nThe Post said the documents did not give any indication of how the request compared to the requirements for Trump's predecessors, also noting that such information is not public.
