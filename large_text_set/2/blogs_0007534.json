Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAtletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo has played down the possibility of Diego Costa rejoining the club. \nCosta moved to Chelsea from Atletico in 2014 but has continually been linked with a Stamford Bridge exit, despite largely impressing in the Premier League. \nThe Spaniard's head was turned by interest from the Chinese Super League last month, while he was attracted by the appeal of a return to Atletico last summer after Chelsea's catastrophic 2015/16 season. \nHowever, he's been firing on all cylinders this term, rattling in 15 goals for the the Blues to underline his importance to the team. \nAnd Cerezo can't envisage Chelsea allowing the 28-year-old to leave, which could be a blow to Atletico if they have to replace Antoine Griezmann, an Â£85million target for Manchester United, in the summer.
