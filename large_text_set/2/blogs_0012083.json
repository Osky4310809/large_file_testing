And to a mixed reaction from the crowd, he repeated several times the claim that his climate plan is “the most conservative.”\nOn stage Monday and in an interview with the Post, Chong took pains to distance himself from what he called the “disaster” of climate plans currently in the works from the Liberal government, and put in place by the Liberal government in Ontario and the NDP in Alberta.\n“Some of the revenues, if not all the revenues, are being spent on government programs. The right way to do it is to price carbon through a revenue-neutral carbon tax where all the revenues are used to introduce one of the largest tax cuts in Canadian history,” he told the National Post, noting the British Columbia government followed a similar approach.\nUnder his plan, a price on carbon would be set at $10 per tonne in 2018 and would rise by the same amount every year, to $130 per tonne in 2030. (Trudeau’s plan sets the price at $10 per tonne in 2018 and anticipates $50 per tonne in 2022.) The tax would be made revenue-neutral, he claims, via corresponding reductions in personal and corporate income tax and “carbon incentives” that would be transferred to the provinces. He would have the auditor general review the tax every year to make sure it was revenue-neutral.\nRelated Kevin Libin: Dear carbon-tax Republicans — Canadians are here from the future to stop you before it’s too late PM missed opportunity to ‘put something on table’ during Trump meetings: Tory leadership candidates O’Leary displays modest French skills in Montreal debate, but is again the target of other candidates Chong boasts that the plan is fully costed and has been endorsed by four economists — prompting rival candidate Andrew Saxton to joke that was a reason for Chong to go back to the drawing board — and by Mark Cameron, a former policy director for Stephen Harper. Chong also points out that some big-name conservatives like Preston Manning support the idea of carbon pricing. In response to a request from the National Post Tuesday, however, his organization the Manning Centre responded saying Manning “has not endorsed any candidate or any of their policies.” The group is trying to “remain as neutral as possible” ahead of an unofficial leadership debate they are hosting in Ottawa next week. \nChong’s proposal sets him offside from the rest of the Conservative leadership candidates, every one of whom has pledged to undo the Liberal government’s plan to tax carbon. His break from the pack on the issue speaks to the challenge candidates face between building support with the CPC members, who will elect the party’s leader, and positioning themselves as someone who could win a general election. Fellow candidates Lisa Raitt and Kevin O’Leary have also made a point so far of talking about the bigger narratives at play in Canadian politics, and their ability to eventually beat Trudeau the next time the country goes to the polls. \nIf his stance on carbon pricing sets Chong apart from his rivals, it has also put him squarely in their crosshairs.\n“I disagree with Michael’s approach. I don’t think the answers to problems are solved by new taxes,” said Saskatchewan MP and former House speaker Andrew Scheer, the candidate who has garnered the most support from his parliamentary caucus.\n“I believe Canada can play a world leader in reducing emissions, but we only emit 1.6 per cent of emissions here,” Scheer told the Post Monday, citing an Environment Canada figure based on 2012 greenhouse gas data. “There are new coal-fired power plants coming online in China. We could be exporting our carbon capture technology. We could be exporting our clean coal technology.”\nAnother Ontario MP candidate, Kellie Leitch, took the opportunity Monday to reiterate that she would abolish the Liberal carbon tax, which imposes a 2018 deadline on the provinces to price carbon in line with federal guidelines. While “pollution is a complex issue,” Leitch said, she would instead focus on “a green economy so that we can innovate in the future and create jobs.”\nChong, however, insists that if the Conservatives have what he considers a realistic plan — and talk about it now, during the leadership race, rather than three weeks into a general election campaign years from now — it could prove an opportunity for the Tories to gain new support.  “If we don’t have a credible policy to reduce emissions,” he said, “we cannot win the next election.”  \nEmail: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: mariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:15:56.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
