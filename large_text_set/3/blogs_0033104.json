Photo: Qatar Airlines \nTwo airlines from the Middle East are coming to the rescue of fliers that have been effected by President Trumpâ€™s recent executive order banning the use of tablets and laptops on flights to the U.S. \nBoth Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways launched new electronics loaner programers for passengers this week, giving customers the option to rent an iPad while their own device is safely stored with the checked baggage. \nThe Trump administration made the decision to ban tablets and other electronic devices that are larger than a smartphone earlier this week. A terrorist plot in which explosives would have been hidden inside an iPad and later detonated was cited as the reason for the ban by the U.S. and U.K. \nQatar Airlines revealed today that they have purchased laptops available for loan on all of their US flights, giving customers uninterrupted productivity while flying. The loaner laptops will be available to all Business Class passengers traveling to the US starting next week. To get one, you just have to request a device from the flight attendants. Along with free laptops, Qatar is also giving out one free hour of WiFi to all passengers. You can get WiFi for the entire flight for just $5. \nEthihad Airways announced that it is giving WiFi away for free. It is also loaning iPads to business class passengers when they check in their smartphones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:11:30.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
