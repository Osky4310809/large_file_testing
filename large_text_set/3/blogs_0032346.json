Sarah fronted the beloved duo Keep Shelly in Athens for the better part of a decade, and now she is stepping into the spotlight on her own. “Who Am I” is the title track to her upcoming debut album as a solo artist, and we are very excited to premiere both the song and its accompanying visual above. \nSarah describes the song and album’s concept as one addressing “humanity, the world we live in and our importance (or unimportance) as individuals and/or as a whole.” This is… weighty, to say the least, yet such a philosophical concept is executed in a musical style that is a far cry from overtly serious. Combining elements of house, pop and jungle music, it is a melange that meshes perfectly with Sarah’s playful vocals. \nThe video meanwhile, introduces an element that is downright disturbing, bringing to mind imagery one would find in the Giallo horror films of Dario Argento. Directed by Oirot Buntot and shot at the Teatro Rossi Aperto in Pisa, it depicts the singer in a macabre dance with shadowy figures seemingly made of plaster. It is mysterious and elusive, but then again, so is the artist behind it. \nSarah P.’s Who Am I is out on May 12 via EraseRestart Records.\nFor more of our premieres, check out this darkly noir visual “Bitta” from Eskeerdo right here . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:21:16.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
