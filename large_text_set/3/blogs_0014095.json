(ANI) \nFour days after BJP got a comfortable majority in Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls winning 312 seats out of 403, the party is yet to decide on who will be it’s chief ministerial candidate. There are some name doing the round for the post including Rajnath Singh , Yogi Adityanath, Keshav Prasad Maurya, Manoj Sinha and Varun Gandhi. \nWith his name doing rounds for the post, Yogi Adityanath’s supporters today organised havans and prayed that he be made state chief minister. Even as he has never showed his eagerness to hold chief minister’s post, that could be deceptive as his supporters had earlier organised protests in Gorakhpur, demanding the declaration of the Gorakhpur Member of the Parliament as the party’s CM candidate in the state. \nSoon after BJP won elections on Saturday, the firebrand leader spoke to the media and said, “People have rejected the SP- Congress alliance in a big way; this is a vote for development.” What was clear from this was that he had bowed before the Narendra Modi wave and acknowledged that the prime minister’s agenda was the right and proper path for the party in the state. \nHowever, ertain developments are now indicating that Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh will be entrusted with the crucial responsibility. According to CNN-News18 report, Singh’s security personnel have visited Chief Minister’s residence in Lucknow. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nThe purpose of the reported visit was to conduct reconnaissance and review the security situation. Though, nothing has been finalized by BJP top brass, this development may well have suggested that who will be the 21st Chief Minister of UP. Rajnath, however, has maintained that he is content with his Home Ministry. \nUttar Pradesh BJP legislature party is likely to meet on March 16 to decide who would be the next chief minister of the key Hindi heartland state, days after the party’s landslide victory. The saffron party is set to return to power in the state after a decade-and-a-half. The party’s central observers, Union M Venkaiah Naidu and general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, would be present at the meeting. Please Wait while comments are loading...
