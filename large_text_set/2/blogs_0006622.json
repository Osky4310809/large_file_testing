He now has five criminal cases pending against him in the county, where he has been jailed since June. \nCounty prosecutors also allege that he purposely hit people with a car after being asked to leave a housewarming party, dodged law enforcement attempts to serve him with a warrant, threatened to kill a jail deputy and damaged a jail television. \nDuring a court appearance on the latest charge, Randle said he defended himself when another inmate punched him in the face. His bonds now total $59,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:05:39.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
