She never told the police about her boyfriend but he eventually disappeared. \nBut for Sarah, she said the biggest problem in escaping comes after sex workers reach out for help. \nSarah has since gone on to get a degree, but for others just finding work can be impossible. \n“The hard part is filling in those gaps on your CV - how do you explain you haven’t had a real job for ten years?” she said.
