I am outraged. It was not even a foul. \n\"The referee has not given me any explanation, as always.\" \nBarca were forced to dig deep as they secured a narrow victory over two legs, in a match which also saw Sergi Roberto and Yannick Carrasco sent off. \nSubstitute Kevin Gameiro gave Atletico some hope with seven minutes remaining, following Suarez's 43rd-minute opener, but the hosts held on to reach a third consecutive final. \nAtletico's Antoine Griezmann also had a goal incorrectly disallowed for offside in the second half. \n\"We were aware that it would be complicated and we knew we had to suffer to reach the final,\" Suarez added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:32:55.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
