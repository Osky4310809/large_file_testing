Convenience store clerk Riley Juel recovers at the hospital in Wichita, Kansas, on March 2. Maria Loving / Christi Health via AP \nDeaton, 28, fled in Juel's Cadillac and was caught after a high-speed chase with the Kansas Highway Patrol that ended in a fiery crash, police said. \nDeaton is suspected in the murder of his girlfriend, 30-year-old Heather Robinson, whose body was found at her Rankin County, Mississippi home on Friday. He is also suspected of being involved in the death of a woman found fatally shot at her Neshoba County church on Thursday. \nDeaton had been chased by sheriff's deputies earlier Wednesday morning, but the stolen car he was driving was disabled by stop sticks and he entered the Kwik Shop and demanded Juel's keys, authorities said. \nAfter Juel handed the keys over, he said Deaton shot him at point-blank range and fled. Juel called 911 and thanked the dispatcher and a police officer who arrived on the scene. \"If it wasn't for them, I probably would have been dead,\" he told the station. Alex Deaton, 28, is suspected of killing two people and shooting a store clerk in a three-state crime spree. MBI via WLBT \nJuel is stable at a hospital. Jule's sister, Brooke Juel, told the KSNW her brother's call to police helped catch the suspect, and called him a hero . \nDeaton also allegedly shot a jogger at random from his vehicle in Mississippi on Friday, and carjacked and briefly kidnapped a couple at a trailhead near Albuquerque on Tuesday. \nDuring the carjacking and kidnapping, Deaton shot a man in the buttocks and a bullet grazed a woman as they escaped, the Rankin County, Mississippi, sheriff's office said. \nAlso Friday, Deaton's family said in a statement that they are \"in a state of disbelief\" and are fully cooperating with law enforcement. \n\"Our family is deeply shocked, saddened and horrified at all that has unfolded since last Wednesday,\" Deaton's family said in a statement to NBC affiliate WLBT in Jackson. \n\"We are devastated and completely heartbroken for all that has happened. Our family is in a state of disbelief. We don't understand why or how this could ever happen and are just thankful it has now come to an end,\" the statement said. The family expressed condolences to the victims and their families. \nRankin County, Mississippi, Sheriff Bryan Bailey says investigators hoped to talk to Deaton Thursday afternoon. Authorities are expected to seek extradition to Mississippi.
