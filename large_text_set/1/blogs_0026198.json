One Woman Has Perfect Response to Stranger Who Called Her “Heavyset” \nMadalyn Parsch, a 27-year-old sales rep and yoga instructor from Caro, MI, was strolling through a Farmer’s Market when she heard some familiar words: “You could model even though you’re heavyset …“ Image Source: Madalyn Parsch \nA man whom Parsch describes as old enough to be her father followed her around the shop, trying to give her advice about how to break into the modeling industry. She had never met this man, never spoken to him before, and certainly never asked for his unsolicited opinion on whether or not she could make it as a model. \n“What … probably … 165-170 lbs? Am I right, sweetheart?” \nHe then persisted, saying that if plus-size modeling wasn’t her thing, she could probably (yes, most definitely!) be a hair model, despite the fact that she “wasn’t tall and slim like most models.” At the time, Parsch simply nodded and smiled, trying her best to ignore him and get away. \nBut later, in a powerful blog post on The Odyssey, Parsch revealed what she wished she had said back to this man, speaking out for women everywhere who receive remarks that their bodies are not quite up to snuff. \n“It annoyed me that I didn’t have a clever comeback that eloquently put him in his place while also destroying his misogynistic outlook,” she wrote. “But words were hard to find while assessing my actual safety in a parking lot with a stranger who was bold enough to approach me in the manner that he did.” Image Source: Madalyn Parsch \nParsch, who tells Babble that she describes her body as athletic and “knows her way around a plate of nachos,” addressed the misogynistic attitude that many men have towards women and their weight in her blog. Namely, that any woman who is not stick-thin must have body issues. I mean, does this man think that it’s the goal of every woman to be told that she is pretty enough to model? \nUm, no. \nShe wrote in her blog: \n“His level of audacity and entitlement took me off guard … he thought he was doing me a favor. The tone of his voice, the words he chose, and the manner in which he spoke to me reeked of self-righteousness. Like he was the first person to tell me how beautiful I was, even though I’m chubby. Like he was finally validating my fat existence, even though I am not fat.” \nShe decided to speak out about this particular incident because she notes that as women, our default is sometimes to laugh off these sorts of inappropriate comments. \n“This was not the first time this has happened to me; being made uncomfortable, being objectified, being followed around,” she explains. “And it has happened to many of my female friends and family members. I wrote about it to get out my frustrations and be able to find my voice the next time something like this happens.” Image Source: Madalyn Parsch \nWhat’s so powerful about Parsch’s post is that she calls attentions to the type of thinly-veiled insults, disguised as compliments, that all women receive in some form or another regarding their appearance. She shared with us just a few examples of what people have said to her over the years: \n“You have the body type that I am just very attracted to. You just have a great body for a bigger girl.” – a former boss \n“If I weren’t twice your age, I’d take you out.” — a customer \nI could never get away with wearing that, you’re so brave!” — a former friend’s mom \nParsch started writing for The Odyssey , part of the Self Love Beauty movement founded by Lisa Thompson, to empower women to love themselves and take action against harmful body-shaming in our society. She describes how even years ago, an encounter like this would have emotionally “wrecked” her. \n“It was because of comments similar to the ones he was making: ‘You’re pretty but …‘, ‘You’re smart even though …‘, ‘You could totally be good at ( fill in the blank) if …’ There were many things factored into my self-doubt.” Image Source: Madalyn Parsch \nLiving in a healthy size 12, it’s taken her years to have the positive body image she has now. Parsch credits her yoga practice as a large part of what has helped her learn to love her body, along with strengthening her relationship with God and the Universe. \n“Studying yoga helped me change the words I used when talking to myself and that made a huge difference in the way I saw myself,” she says. “It reinforced the idea of God making me perfect and in His image.” \nAnd just in case this man or any others like him are reading, Parsch has this to say: “180 glorious pounds am I, and my thighs are strong enough to crush a grown man’s skull. Please, sir, do not approach me again.” Related Post Article Posted 11 hours Ago Share this article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T05:35:52.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
