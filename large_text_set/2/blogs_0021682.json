We’ve got the gay men who will not leave that bed until both parties have achieved their goal. And we’ve got bisexual men who have a win-win situation. \nFor women, we’ve got the lesbians who are banging other ladies (who presumably know how to work with their equipment). We’ve got the bisexual women who are having that nice, lesbian sex half the time. And finally, we’ve got straight women, who are usually having sex with dudes who have no idea what they’re doing. \nWhich of these groups of people do you think is having the least amount of orgasms? \nYep, you guessed it: straight women.

They found that heterosexual men are orgasming more than anyone else, with a staggering 95 percent orgasm rate. \nThis is in stark contrast to straight women, who are only orgasming 65 percent of the time — lower than any other group the researchers surveyed.
