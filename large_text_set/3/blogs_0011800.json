Meek was cited for misdemeanor assault earlier this week for allegedly fighting 2 guys at the St. Louis airport.\nMeek's right hand looked like it was in a heavy cast during his performance ... which makes us wonder if he suffered a hand injury during the altercation.\nAs for Zeke, he's still in hot water for pulling a woman's shirt down and exposing her breast at a St. Paddy's parade in Dallas last weekend ... but didn't look like he had a care in the world Thursday night.\nOne interesting note, no women onstage with Zeke last night.
