While HMD Global had confirmed at the time of launch that all three phones would be made available globally in Q2 2017, the details regarding its US availability were largely unknown. \nWhile HMD Global has been tight-lipped over the exact release timeframe, it appears we won’t have to wait too long to get our hands on Nokia’s new range of smartphones. In a response to a user asking for a US release of the Nokia smartphones, the official Nokia Twitter handle said that the company is planning on a global release of its smartphones and that they will also be available in the US. \n@QQwill We're planning on a global release so yes they will be.

The spokesperson also goes on to say that the global release will take place “in 120 countries at same time.” \nHMD has ambitious plans to release Nokia 3, 5 and 6 in 120 markets at same time in Q2 2017. This is ambitious because HMD is de facto a start-up, though it has support from Nokia and Foxconn.\nIt’s not clear whether Nokia will bring its revisited Nokia 3310 feature phone to the US as well, but given the fact that the phone only supports 2G network, it seems unlikely it will ever make to the States unless the company releases a compatible model that works with US networks. \nSource 1: @nokiamobile Source: Nokiapoweruser \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:23:36.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
