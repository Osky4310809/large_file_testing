Video shows French police assault 22-year-old suspect   \nThe footage of the rape has been edited out, but the man was allegedly penetrated in his anal passage by a telescopic baton. \nTear gas was also used on the man when he attempted to resist arrest. \nThe three other officers involved have been charged with “deliberate violence,” and they all will face trail. \nTheo’s injuries were so bad that he required surgery. He remains traumatized and with a “severe wound” in the hospital. \nPolice say the alleged rape was an accident — claiming Theo’s tracksuit pants fell down and the baton penetrated him. \nPolice brought him to the station, noticed his injuries and then called paramedics. \nSince Thursday, rioters have taken to the streets on the 3000, which is named for the number of people who live there, while police try to maintain order. \nA local police source said, \nGangs of youths have been attacking us, and setting property on fire every night. The fear is that this violence will escalate. \nAt one point during the weekend, all of the street lights went out in the 3000 due to vandalism. Graffiti has also appeared on buildings calling the police rapists. \nStephane Troussel, the Socialist politician who is in charge of the Seine-Saint-Denis region where the crime took place, said, \nAlthough thousands of police are doing their work properly… too many arrests end in nightmares for some young people. The image of the Republic is being tarnished. We have to urgently find a solution. \n  CITATIONS DailyMail.com DailyMail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:09:39.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
