( SBUX ) is known mostly for its coffee and related drinks, there are some changes in store for its food menu which they hope will bring some attention. (See also: Starbucks Vs. Dunkin' Donuts: Comparing Business Models .) \nThe coffee chain, in a March 21 press release, said it has added gluten-free and vegan food items to its menu. Some of the items include a gluten free smoked Canadian bacon sandwich, a sprouted grain bagel, lemon chiffon yogurt and Starbucks organic avocado spread. \nThe gluten free sandwich is “prepared in a certified gluten-free environment and sealed into its own oven-safe parchment bag to avoid any cross-contamination,” said Starbucks. With this move, SBUX is looking to appeal to the growing population of consumers who believe gluten isn’t good for them. \nA Technavio study said that the market for gluten-free food would grow at a 12 percent annual rate through 2021, presenting SBUX with an opportunity to benefit from the growth. \nStarbucks isn’t the first to offer gluten-free food items in the fast food industry. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. ( CMG ), for instance, has a list of allergens and special diets that lists corresponding menu items safe for sufferers of those conditions to consume; only one of the items on the list contains gluten. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. ( DNKN ) also tested gluten-free donuts in 2013, although it didn’t ultimately launch the gluten-free donuts in the end. \nThe fact that Dunkin’ didn’t roll out gluten-free donuts speaks to the difficulty that comes with selling gluten-free food, Technomic Chief Insights Officer Darren Tristano told CNBC, adding that Starbucks’ gluten-free initiative won’t be a revenue driver for now. The initiative is more likely to only foster customer retention for Starbucks, Tristano said. \nFood accounts for 20 percent of Starbucks’ total sales , according to Starbucks COO Kevin Johnson, who will succeed Howard Schultz as the CEO next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:22:31.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
