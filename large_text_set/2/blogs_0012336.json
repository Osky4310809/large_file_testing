Handing out business card-sized flyers of a country music band schedule he’d set up at another London club.\nThe events were scheduled at the same time the legion had its own music nights. Apparently, that was serious enough to ban a man who faced down the enemy in the North Atlantic and helped secure the freedoms Canadians have today.\nThen it got worse. After he was banned for band promotion, and lost an appeal, Hanson headed down to the legion on a Saturday night, the usual country music night, wanting to talk to one of the legion’s executive.\nJane Sims/Postmedia Network Second World War veteran Bob Hanson, 90, shows his medals. Instead, the bar steward said he was trespassing and called the police. Everyone saw it. Even the police officer, Hanson said, “was disgusted.”\n“I was exercising my rights. I didn’t think I was doing anything wrong,” he said in an interview.\n“I’m not looking for sympathy. They just ruined my reputation,” he said.\nAnd so, the recently widowed veteran of the Royal Canadian Navy was unceremoniously escorted home in a cop car to his senior’s apartment.\n“The situation as to why he was banned had to do with clubhouse rules and conduct,” said Brian Harris, the executive member who handled the discipline. “And being a military man, I would have thought Bob would understand that.” But there’s more to the tale than just rule-breaking.\nIt’s about a fading older generation, entrenched in tradition and community work, at odds with new-fangled ideas.\nAnd you have to know a little bit more about Hanson. Some would call him spunky; others, feisty. Everyone would say he holds strong opinions.\nThere are things about the way the legion is run that he doesn’t like. In protest, he stopped paying a membership.\nProbably the only thing close to criminal he’s ever done is to lie about his age to sign up with the navy at 17 to serve in the war. He was a gunner on the destroyer HMCS Restigouche (nicknamed Rusty Guts) out of Halifax and made several treacherous trips in the North Sea.\nIn 1946, he and a buddy went to the Palais Royale in Toronto for “dime-a-dance” night where he met his wife, Lorraine. He can tell you what she wore. Their first dance was to the song Near You.\n“She was a fabulous dancer,” he said.\nHanson was no slouch either, picking up prizes over the years at jitterbug competitions. He was also a reigning limbo champ.\nHe worked for Bell Telephone and took university courses to become a communications engineer in Toronto. After he retired, he and Lorraine moved to London in 1999 to be closer to some family. They moved to a seniors’ apartment building a year ago.\nLorraine died last May after an illness. Hanson’s eyes well up just mentioning her name.\nHe may be 90, but he’s got a lot of fight in him.\nMusic always played in the background of their lives. He and Lorraine went out dancing practically every week. Their favourite was old country music, not the modern-day rock-and-roll stuff, but “the kind you can dance to.” Even Elvis is a little too racy for Hanson.\nOn Saturday nights, they’d go to the Victory branch for the weekly country dance. They got to know the bands and would follow them to other venues like Purple Hill, east of the city.\nHanson got in trouble with the executive some time ago when he put up Purple Hill’s schedule on the legion’s bulletin board. He said he agreed he did wrong and took it down.\nBut, when word came last summer that the country music night format was being changed to tribute bands and modern music, Hanson decided he’d help the bands he and his friends loved find a new place to play. And he insists he was transparent with the legion bar steward about what he was up to.\n“The gang that loved the old classic country were getting disappointed and they wouldn’t come out,” he said.\nHanson secured a spot at the Marconi Club in London. He drew up some small flyers to hand out to his friends. He told them to put them in their pockets and not to leave them out at the legion.\nThe bar steward, Hanson said, found a couple left on the tables. Hanson was reported to the executive, then told not to come back for six months.\nSo, Hanson wrote a letter to the legion’s Ontario Command and to the newspaper.\nThe legion’s executive insists this isn’t Hanson’s first trip to the brig, and that he’s run afoul of other veterans’ organizations (something Hanson denies). The branch president, Nellie Stevens, said Hanson has been “creating a problem” and they have “quite a file on him.”\nHarris said Hanson has been given “several warnings and interviews and letters and what-not” over the years. This time, Harris asked for an apology. Hanson refused.\nRelated Legion accused of refusing to allow veteran to lay wreath in honour of fallen comrades Canadian legion says member who complained about treatment of veterans discredited organization Canadian legion suspends 82-year-old member for questioning group’s treatment of veterans They’ve told Hanson if he needs help with pensions and benefits, “we’ll be there in a second.”\nBut the house rules are posted and must be followed, Harris said. Promoting other events that run at the same time as legion affairs cuts into their business and their mission to help seniors and youth.\n“He broke the rules,” Harris said. “It’s the same whether you’re 90 or a 24-year-old veteran. There are certain things you can’t do.”\nThe night the police were called, Harris said, Hanson showed up and created “a ruckus.”\n“He may be 90, but he’s got a lot of fight in him,” Harris said.\nHanson and his friends got “boisterous,” so the police were called.\nHanson likes to “stir the pot,” Harris said. “Everybody at his table is just like Bob and they get fired up.”\nBut Harris said he’s willing to extend an olive branch. “I’m not retreating, I’m going to have a talk with Bob and see what we can do, see if we can put all the bygones in the past.”\nHanson isn’t buying it. “I don’t understand what he’s trying to do,” he said.\nThe old vet wants an apology “and my dignity back.”\nMost of all, he wants to hang out with his pals. “I miss those guys,” he said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:59:43.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
