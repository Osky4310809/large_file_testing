(It goes without saying that I was a strange and ridiculous 13-year-old with obliging parents.) \nI primarily used it to cook samosas, made from Madhur Jaffrey's World-of-the-East Vegetarian Cooking , the spine of which is split to that page, but there were also the occasional onion rings , doughnuts , and—just once—mozzarella sticks. Advertisement Alpha Smoot \nSee, back then, I knew more about eating mozzarella sticks than I did about making them. Somehow, I'd missed the memo that the dredged cheese had to be thoroughly frozen before meeting the super-hot oil. (It goes without saying that I ended up with strands of melted cheese bobbing around in a vat of hot oil. And that no one ate mozzarella sticks that evening.) \nBut now, I've wised up! I've realized that... \na) you don't need a deep-fryer for hardly anything as a home cook to make them, and b) there are certain steps you can take to ensure success.

Cut the cheese (ha!). Photo by Alpha Smoot \nLeave the the fresh, creamy, straight-from-the-cow mozzarella cheese for a good sandwich. To make mozzarella sticks, you're looking for a dry, squeaky mozzarella —the shiny, tacky kind that you might not be so enthusiastic to eat as is. Its low water content will make the cheese easier to dredge (see next step!) and will help it to fry up more nicely. \nWe started with a block of Polly-O and sliced it once in half through its height to make two thinner squares. We then cut each square into five sticks. Of course, you can make whatever shape you want. Mozzarella hexagons? Be my guest. \nPssst : You could even take string cheese and cut it in half once, lengthwise, or leave it just as it came ( au naturale )—no knife work necessary. 2.
