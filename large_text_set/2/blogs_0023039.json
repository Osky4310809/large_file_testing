The discovery has experts demonstrably giddy. “Answering the question ‘are we alone’ is a top science priority, and finding so many planets like these for the first time in the habitable zone is a remarkable step forward toward that goal,\" NASA’s Thomas Zurbuchen said in a statement. \nIn describing the vivid poster, NASA makes a good case for grabbing a suitcase and leaving the planet: \n“Some 40 light-years from Earth, a planet called TRAPPIST-1e offers a heart-stopping view: brilliant objects in a red sky, looming like larger and smaller versions of our own moon. But these are no moons. They are Earth-sized planets in a spectacular planetary system outside our own. These seven rocky worlds huddle around their small, dim, red star, like a family around a campfire. Any of them could harbor liquid water, but the planet shown here, fourth from the TRAPPIST-1 star, is in the habitable zone, the area around the star where liquid water is most likely to be detected.” \nDownload a printable version of the poster here . \nAll images courtesy of NASA-JPL/Caltech More from mental_floss...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:42:49.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
