The competition was ruthless. Everyone was expendable, including partners and mentors. Cohen couldn’t tolerate anyone’s making money before he did — he’d fly into a rage if he heard that a portfolio manager had done a trade without giving him first dibs. “Employees often felt like they were part of an experiment looking at the effects of prolonged stress and uncertainty,” Kolhatkar writes. But my hunch is that readers will most remember “Black Edge” for showing them just how alarmingly pervasive insider trading was in the years surrounding the 2008 collapse. It became commonplace, domesticated — dare I say it? — normalized . Big banks, Kolhatkar writes, often shared what they knew about the status of a stock with SAC Capital first, because they did so much business with it. Whole research firms existed for the sole purpose of connecting shops like SAC Capital to “expert networks,” or to individuals who worked in publicly traded companies, with the expectation that these people would share valuable insights to help those on Wall Street make better trades. The industry called it “earnings intelligence.” But the line between earnings intelligence and inside information could be very hard to discern. Kolhatkar makes a convincing case that Cohen leaned very hard on his employees to get vital information — to find an edge. Hence the book’s title: A “black edge” is early, private, proprietary information about a company. Cohen was too smart to declare explicitly that he wanted it. Instead, he’d ask his employees to give their assessments a “conviction rating,” from one to 10. And why would someone rate a conviction as nine without a black edge? Perhaps the most despicable episode in Kolhatkar’s book involves Mathew Martoma, a portfolio manager for SAC. He struck up a mercenary friendship with an older, lonely neurologist, hoping to wrangle information from him about the status of an experimental drug to treat Alzheimer’s disease. The way Martoma went about seducing him is both sickening and extremely impressive. It worked. Martoma contacted Cohen, who then arranged to unload millions of shares in two companies that were testing the drug. He shorted some of their stock for good measure. Yet, when later pressed for specifics about it by the government, Cohen, “the greatest trader of his generation, who could track the price movements of 80 different securities at a time, claimed not to remember,” Kolhatkar writes. “He said ‘I don’t recall’ 65 times.” It worked. Martoma, as many people know, had a different fate. So how do you end a book like this? In James B. Stewart’s “Den of Thieves,” it was easy: Michael Milken was sent to jail. Here, Kolhatkar doesn’t have so gratifying an option, but her ending is no less chilling for it. She notes that in 2014, Cohen made $2.5 billion by trading his personal fortune alone. “He is making plans to reopen his hedge fund,” she writes, “as soon as possible.” \nFollow Jennifer Senior on Twitter: @jenseniorny \nBlack Edge: Inside Information, Dirty Money, and the Quest to Bring Down the Most Wanted Man on Wall StreetBy Sheelah Kolhatkar344 pages.
