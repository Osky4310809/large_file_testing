Image caption The museum is due to open next year \nMr Gowans, who is a senior lecturer in graphic design at Dundee's Duncan of Jordanstone art college, said: \"I drive past it every day, it's a beautiful building. \n\"The look of it at the moment feels a little Star Wars-y. \n\"Every time I drive by it I can't get Darth Vader's death march tune out of my head. \n\"When I go past it I just hear Star Wars theme tunes. \n\"I did it over a couple of weekends and a few nights here and there. I thought I'd have a bit of fun and post it to a few friends.\" Image copyright Gary Gowans \nMr Gowans said he was \"slightly shell-shocked\" at the reaction to the video. \nHe said: \"It's the first time I've ever done anything on Facebook. \n\"I posted it at four o'clock and I thought a few folk would see it. \n\"I woke up this morning and my daughter and my wife said you won't believe the amount of people who are viewing it. \n\"It's all a bit of a surprise.\" \nA V&A Dundee spokesman said: \"We're delighted to see talented people like Gary being inspired by our building before we even open next year, resulting in such fun and creative work.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:16:53.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
