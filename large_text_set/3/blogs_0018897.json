Nate | Email \nBrett Favre is throwing LASERS out there. Absolutely hilarious but you wouldn’t want Favre to be any other way. In his mind he’s always an injury away from a comeback. He definitely had dreams last season about suiting about for the Browns or coming back to take a few snaps for the Raiders after Carr went down. So if the camera is on, he’s firing bullets. Making sure his footwork is A+. Looking off safeties that don’t even exist. Honestly, I wouldn’t be shocked if he never even officially filed his retirement papers. The NFL kinda just shuffled him into the Hall Of Fame because they knew he wouldn’t ever sign them. \nJust saying….Favre is still only 47, jacked as shit, and his arm has been rested for the last few seasons…if Kirk goes to San Fran…just saying… Nate |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:55:58.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
