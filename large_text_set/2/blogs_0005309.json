This is usually the case with a new jailbreak. Purchases are disabled to prevent users from buying incompatible packages that could create issues. \nNow that Cydia and the jailbreak are much more stable, Saurik re-enabled the purchasing of tweaks today. This means that you can now purchase your favorite tweaks from Cydia without any restrictions. Additionally, Cydia has been updated to version 1.1.28 to better support iOS 10 and brings a major change to the package management system that is being used. You will find the latest update in the Changes tab once you refresh Cydia. \nWith purchases now enabled, you might still be unable to buy some of your favorite tweaks. This is because developers have to manually turn on the purchasing of their tweaks. Those that haven’t been updated for iOS 10 are likely to remain disabled to avoid users from installing them and facing issues. \nWe recommend that all iOS 10 jailbreak users update to the latest version of Cydia. The latest build is available on the Cydia/Telesphoreo repo, which is one of the default repos in Cydia. You should be able to see the latest update in the Changes tab once Cydia has been refreshed. \nNow that purchases have been enabled, what is the first tweak that you plan on buying?
