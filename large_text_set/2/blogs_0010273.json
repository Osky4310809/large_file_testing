Pro-Biafrans \n“We are not a political party but a cultural organisation and would want to see a president general that will protect the interest of our people to give our suffering masses a new look. \n“But politicians with their political slogan and tactics have infiltrated Ohanaeze and no longer looks like a cultural organisation,” he said. \nOnyia, therefore, disclosed that Chief Ralph Obioha remained the recognised leader of the interim executive of the organisation, adding “as far as we are concerned, Ohanaeze election has not held. \n“The only recognised leader of Ohanaeze Ndi Igbo as we know it today is Chief Ralph Obioha, because there is no way we can recognise anyone not elected in line with our constitution. \n“We are not after office but credibility and rule of law. We have had leaders who wanted to grease their pockets and aligned with politicians at the federal level while our people suffered. \n“We want to put a stop to that because nobody will lead us without our consent,” he said \nOnyia, however, said that the organisation was made up of intellectuals and honourable members who were too preoccupied with bigger things to exchange tantrums \nHe called on well meaning sons of the area to wade into the crisis, which he said, had held the organisation down for too long in order to secure the future of the people of the area. \nHe said that Imo Gov. Rochas Okorocha had done his best to ensure peace and unity in the organisation, but regretted that his efforts were derailed by those who never wanted the people to speak as one. \n“When in February 2016, it became obvious that the Igbo nation was in disarray, Okorocha invited aggrieved members of the organisation and we had a peaceful accord,” Onyia said.
