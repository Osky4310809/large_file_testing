Vidya Balan , who is currently on a promotional spree for Begum Jaan, incessantly faces such questions and is quite fed up with it. Sharing an anecdote from her wedding, Vidya told a leading daily: \nI don’t think it’s anyone’s business except mine and my husband’s. It was a serious invasion on our privacy, but our country is such. Neighbours and relatives ask us unnecessary questions. The day I got married, one of my uncles told me at the wedding venue, “Next time I see you (her and Siddharth), I should be looking at three people, not two.” This was even before our wedding pictures could be clicked. I politely laughed because we hadn’t even decided on our honeymoon destination then. She further said: \nWhat is this baby obsession? I am not a baby-making machine. Anyway, the world population is on a rise. If some people don’t have children, it’s fine. \nThere, you heard it, loud and clear! 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:16:04.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
