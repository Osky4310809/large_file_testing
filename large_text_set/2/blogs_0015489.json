Use these to impress your friends over the weekend. \nLaCroix is better known at the ubiquitous hipster beverage that is slightly less weird than some of the other carbonated beverages that people drink . By now, we all know that the fake-French fizzy water is actually from Wisconsin, but did you know that LaCroix doesn't advertise? No? Then we'll have to do it for them. Read on to learn all about LaCroix! It's Actually Pronounced La Croy \n(source) \nThere are many ways to pronounce LaCroix, but only one way that's correct — \"La Croy \". And even though it sounds French, it's actually named after two Wisconsin locations — the St. Croix River and LaCrosse, the hometown of LaCroix. But that doesn't have to stop you from sounding as fake-French as possible! It's Been Around for Longer Than you Think \n(source) \nLaCroix seems like it's come out of nowhere, but it's been pretty well known in the Midwest since the early 1990s and was invented in 1981. It was created to be an \"anti-Perrier\" that would appeal to that section of the public who wanted a sparkling water but didn't want something all fancy. Parce que Perrier est pour les snobs . There Were Only Six Flavors in 2004 \n(source) \nLaCroix has seen a recent explosion in popularity, and as the demand for the sparkly beverage increased, so too did the number of flavors. Today, we have access to 20 delicious varieties of LaCroix, including the unflavored flavor. LaCroix comes in pure, berry, cran-raspberry, lemon, lime, lemon-lime, orange, passion fruit, apricot, mango, pamplemousse (i.e. grapefruit), coconut, peach-pear, tangerine, apple-berry, cherry-lime, melon-grapefruit, kiwi-watermelon, pineapple-strawberry, and cucumber-blackberry. (Okay, so there's actually 19 delicious flavors and then there's coconut.) LaCroix Doesn't Advertise \n(source) \nThe fun, brightly-colored '90s throwback design on their cans is enough to catch the consumer's eye. LaCroix is America's best-selling sparkling water brand and they don't do any advertising. You'll see it in LaCroix-inspired art, rap videos on You Tube, and t-shirts that say \"LaCroix over boys\", but you won't ever see a single commercial for it. LaCroix is Popular Because Soda Isn't \n(source) \nMore and more people are drinking LaCroix while less and less people are drinking soda. Americans have been losing their tastes for sugary soft-drinks, and LaCroix has been picking up in popularity because it's a great alternative to fizzy sodas. Sorry, Coke and Pepsi! \nWhat's your favorite flavor of LaCroix?
