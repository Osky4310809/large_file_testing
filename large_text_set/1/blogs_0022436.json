Its smartphones were listed as “out of stock” for much of the year, and sold out pretty fast once devices became available again. Obviously this isn’t a good business practice, which is why OnePlus is going to take shipping times more seriously this year.\nSee also: OnePlus 3T review November 21, 2016 As part of OnePlus’ New Year’s resolution, the company says it will start things off with a bang on Tuesday, January 24. That’s when the company plans to ship the 64GB OnePlus 3T Gunmetal model immediately after it receives orders for the phone in North America and Europe, instead of waiting to ship the devices.\nWhile OnePlus says it “can’t guarantee that this offer will be permanently available”, it does add that this is one of the company’s goals.\nKeep in mind this is just for the 64GB Gunmetal version of the OnePlus 3T. If you are waiting for the 128GB version, or if you wanted the phone in a Soft Gold color, you are still out of luck as both of these options are not currently available on OnePlus’ site. As of right now, there’s no indication as to when they will be going on sale again.\nHave you run into any shipping delays from OnePlus? Do you think the company will be successful in speeding things up from now on?
