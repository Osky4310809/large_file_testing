Customers have been walking away from sit-down chains as convenience and affordability take precedence. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) \nRuby Tuesday closed 109 restaurants last year. \nCosi, a nationwide chain that specializes in flatbreads, sandwiches and square bagels, filed for bankruptcy. So did Ovation Brands, which owns Old Country Buffet, Ryan’s restaurants and other chains. So did Logan’s Roadhouse. \nIt was a bad year for restaurants. And 2017 may be even worse. \nRecent stories by Samantha Bomkamp in the Chicago Tribune help to explain why. What we are seeing now is a perfect storm of economic realities striking the industry. \nThe cost of food is actually going down. One government index shows that grocery prices fell by 2.2 percent last year. But rather than pass this savings on to the customers, restaurants increased their prices an average of 2.4 percent. As a result, the difference between the cost of going out to eat and the cost of eating at home is greater than it has been in 30 years. \nWhy? The articles cite a couple of reasons. One is the cost of rent. The other, which is more significant, is the cost of labor. In many states, the minimum wage has been rising — it just tiptoed up a nickel to $7.70 per hour in Missouri but remains at $8.25 for most of Illinois (except Cook County, where it will soon begin a series of increases until it reaches $13 an hour in 2020). \nMany people believe that the minimum wage does not apply to restaurants because the servers are paid mostly in tips. But dishwashers generally make minimum wage, and so do many hostesses, busers, janitors and some of the kitchen help. Many of the cooks do not make significantly more than minimum wage, so as the minimum rate increases so will their pay. \nThe amount of money paid to tipped employees such as waiters and bartenders is also tied to the minimum wage. In Missouri, they get at least 50 percent of the wage, or $3.65 per hour. But in all states, tipped employees must receive at least the minimum wage from a combination of tips and wages. \nIn other words, if a Missouri waiter only makes $2 an hour in tips, the restaurant has to pay him a total of $5.70 per hour in order to get his wages up to the full amount guaranteed by the minimum wage. \nAnd there are other drains on a restaurant’s finances. The equipment gets a lot of use and is often subjected to extreme temperatures. Plates and glasses break. Chairs and tables wear out. Health code regulations must be strictly followed. And the question of how much fresh and perishable ingredients they must order is, at best, an educated guess. \nWith all of these forces bringing their own economic pressures, restaurants have to deal with perhaps their biggest challenge: changing tastes. \nRestaurants thrive on consistency. When consumers go to a steakhouse they expect their prime rib to taste the same every time they order it. So a large part of the stress for restaurants comes from attempting to ensure that they turn out the same quality of food with every order.
