Maybe your New Year's resolution was to give up alcohol, or perhaps, like this emotional woman, it was ice cream.\nAn unnamed customer left a \"very, very upset\" voicemail for Australia's artisanal gelato lords, Gelato Messina, on NYE — angry that their Fitzroy store ruined her New Year's Eve by closing early.\nAnd boy, does it sound remarkably (and hilariously) like a heartbroken break-up message.\n\"My New Year's Eve is now ruined. I had plans to buy at least a litre and a half of Messina, as I do every week, and sit on my couch, and eat it and then make New Year's Eve resolutions to never eat it again,\" the woman said.\n\"And you know what, because you are closed, it's going to make my New Year's Eve resolution of not eating Messina so much easier — because I am very, very upset right now.\"\nIt's seems too perfectly painful to be real. But Gelato Messina, who posted the voicemail on its Facebook page on Wednesday, \"promise\" that it's genuine.\nWe'd be very, very upset if it wasn't.
