But, if you had sat the doubters down in front of three powerful and emotional Emmerdale storylines this week without revealing the genre of the show, they couldn’t have failed to have been blown away. \nFor several years, Emmerdale has been dismissing its undeserved reputation as the third best soap, winning countless awards, increasing viewing figures, smashing social media and earning well deserved critical acclaim.\nAnd this week, they have proven once again that they are more than just a 7pm TV soap set in the countryside. Despite being under the immense pressure of churning out six episodes of drama every single week, Emmerdale hit us with jaw dropping and powerful scenes, the likes of which we would be impressed to see in a six part drama that has taken a year to produce.\n(Picture: ITV) While never losing its value as a soap or pretentiously trying to be something it’s not, Emmerdale continues to tackle brave and emotional stories that resonate massively with the audience and leave us in tears long after the credits roll.\nEmmerdale is still a soap – there are still scandalous affairs, plots that are ever so slightly bordering on the bonkers (we love you, Emma Barton!), secrets, lies, stunts and slapstick but weaved throughout are the raw, realistic and deeply human scenes that set that bar so much higher and give Emmerdale – and the soap genre – a whole new identity that makes it impossible to dismiss the work done as ‘just’ soap.\nWhy Emmerdale’s John Middleton is one of TV’s best actors and deserves some serious recognition Ashley Thomas’ dementia storyline is, without a doubt, one of the most powerful story ever taken on by a soap. It’s not rushed, it’s not hammed up for drama or ratings, it’s honest and it is unwavering. When Emmerdale chose to go down this route with Ashley, they decided from the outset to do it properly.\nThis must be so hard for Laurel! #Emmerdale pic.twitter.com/GmKx6NgCGI \n— Emmerdale (@emmerdale) March 27, 2017 \n\nThe representation of the cruel disease and the heartbreaking effects on the family and loved ones is not easy to watch – often, it is downright devastating. Amongst the gloom and the unavoidable hopelessness of Ashley’s plight, Emmerdale have also injected warmth, love, humour and joy into the story, highlighting the strength of Ashley, Laurel, the kids and everyone connected.\nThis week’s scene, which saw Ashley and Laurel share a dance together at the care home, hit us with so many bittersweet emotions. It was surprising and understated and made us smile through tears of pain.\n(Picture: ITV) The contrast between the knowledge that Ashley will never get better and the happiness at seeing flickers of recognition and love in Ashley made for a simply beautiful scene. And it wasn’t the only moment that had a massive impact this week.\nFaith Dingle – who, so far has largely been portrayed as a comedy character brimming with mischief – revealed a much more vulnerable side in brave and harrowing scenes which saw her secretly suffer in the wake of a double mastectomy .\n12 reasons why the amazing Faith Dingle is the new queen of Emmerdale Faith is hiding the secret from Chas – wanting her daughter to accept her back in her life without knowing the truth of what she has been through (our thoughts are that she wants Chas to forgive her because she wants to rather than through sympathy) – but viewers saw a scene which saw a tearful Faith gaze at the scars on her chest.\n\nFans have been commending Emmerdale for raising the topic and the discussion and, as part of the episode, they used a body double called Brigitte Coles who is a cancer survivor in order not to shy away from the subject.\nEmmerdale spoilers: Star Sally Dexter speaks out on Faith Dingle cancer secret The scenes between Sally Dexter and Lucy Pargeter in which they delved through their past with mutual agony were heartbreaking and raw enough with some stunning performances from both. But the reveal of Faith’s heartbreaking secret has had a long lasting effect on viewers and the strength of Faith’s character and her determination to carry on and improve her life is an inspirational watch – proof that there can be life after a mastectomy without understating how painful it can be both physically and emotionally.\n(Picture: ITV) These two stories have been played perfectly and a third strand saw Gemma Atkinson prove once more what a brilliant actress she is when Carly Hope opened up to her dad Bob about what had happened to her baby son, Billy.\nIn the initial scenes last year which saw Carly confide in Marlon, our hearts broke and when Emmerdale revisited the story this week, we were moved even further. Carly’s recent shortcomings which saw her freeze when April choked and then consider fleeing the village made so much sense in context and Emmerdale are showing her inner torture, guilt and self blame over the tragedy that shaped her life.\n\nThe scenes were very subtle, far from overplayed with hysteria but they were raw and emotional.\nSoaps should never lose what makes them soaps – punch ups, shock murders, sex scandals and humour must always remain staples of the genre. But this week in Emmerdale has proven that there is far more to the genre than some often give it credit for.\nIf there are any scenes which can finally shed the impression that soap acting is a lesser, easier or less effective form of performance, then they are this week’s beautiful Emmerdale episodes.\nPROMO: To have something that makes saying goodbye so hard is a life lived… #ByeAshley #Emmerdale https://t.co/cQaNhqDMAn pic.twitter.com/ehsacuBAAG \n— Emmerdale (@emmerdale) March 29, 2017 \n\nThe show is at the top of it’s game at the moment – and that’s not just the soap game but the television game as a whole.\nAnd with the heartbreaking episodes next week that see Ashley’s story come to a close , the most effective drama may still be to come.\nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Devastating new pictures show the start of Ashley’s death as he collapses \nMORE: Adam Thomas responds to Emmerdale exit rumours ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T14:28:22.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
