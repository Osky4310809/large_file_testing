Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\nUS president-elect Donald Trump says he won’t let failed state North Korea drop a nuclear bomb on America.\nIn his now trademark diplomacy-by-tweet, Trump said : “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won’t happen!”\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a televised New Year’s Day speech , said his country was about to test its first intercontinental ballistic missile, which could be equipped with nuclear warheads and within range of the US.\n“Research and development of cutting edge arms equipment is actively progressing and ICBM rocket test launch preparation is in its last stage,” Kim said during a televised New Year’s Day speech.\nTrump followed his tweet with a criticism of China for not helping keep North Korea under control.\n“China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice.”\nDonald Trump. AP Photo/ Evan Vucci\nUN sanctions have been in place against North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests since 2006.\nLast year, North Korea increased its testing of ballistic missiles and in September conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test.\nThis prompted the UN Security Council to tighten sanctions.\nThe Pentagon reacted to North Korea’s latest announcement by warning the country against “provocative actions.”\nThe US said: “Multiple UN Security Council resolutions explicitly prohibit North Korea’s launches using ballistic missile technology.”\nDonald Trump last month, in a series of tweets, accused China of currency manipulation and militarising the South China Sea.\nHe said then: “Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the US doesn’t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea. I don’t think so!”\nHe also upset China by having a protocol-breaking phone conversation with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen who called to congratulate Trump on his election win.\nRead the original article on Business Insider Australia .
