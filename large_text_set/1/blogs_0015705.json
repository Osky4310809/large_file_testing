All traffic along the freeway connecting California and Arizona was blocked indefinitely when the bridge over a desert wash collapsed during a major storm, and the roadway in the opposite direction sustained severe damage. Matt York AP i \nBy Dan Walters \ndwalters@sacbee.com \nWhen California was building what became a world-class network of freeways, highways and local roads after World War II, it relied on a simple financial tool called “user pays.”  ; \nPersonal and commercial users of roadways paid for their construction and maintenance through fuel taxes, motor vehicle fees, bridge tolls and weight fees on trucks. \nThe system enjoyed wide public support because of its self-evident fairness, although there were occasional squabbles over how the money was being spent. \nIt broke down in the 1970s as those on the left came to see highways as an environmental and social evil and those on the right rigidly opposed new taxes of any kind. \nJerry Brown’s first governorship was marked by ceaseless wrangling in the Capitol over the issue as new construction slowed to a crawl but traffic spiked upward. \nFour decades later, California motorists are paying some of the nation’s highest gasoline taxes but face the nation’s worst traffic congestion on roadways that are crumbling from heavy use (nearly a billion vehicle-miles a day) and maintenance neglect. \nMeanwhile, the time-tested user-pays principle has eroded. The state has sometimes used bonds for highway construction, most prominently a 2006 bond issue that then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger championed. And local governments have turned to sales tax increases to finance not only local projects but state highways.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T10:11:31.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
