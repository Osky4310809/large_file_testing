And if we need to call on him we can. So it’s a good relationship we’ve got with Joe. This is his home, this is where he started his career and he’s got a great attitude... we will play our youngsters and we will back our youngsters and Joe is there to help support the guys,” Fleck continued. \nPietersen played for the Stormers between 2006 and 2013, before leaving to join Biarritz in France. \nHe also had stints at the Cheetahs and Sharks and has been on the books of the Kamaishi Seawaves since 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:03:12.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
