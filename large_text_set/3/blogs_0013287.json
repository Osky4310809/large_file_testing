Shouldn't your PC too? \nCheck out our beginner's guide to RGB lighting your PC . \nIf there’s one single feature PC hardware companies have beaten to a bloody pulp by now, it’s RGB lighting. Some purists argue that it’s an unnecessary gimmick , but others can’t help but be drawn to the appeal of having a 24/7 party on their desktop. Lucky for them, there’s also plenty of LED lighting options to bring the party to the PC too. \nLighting up the interior of a PC is nothing new. Cold cathode light tubes, basic LED strips and LED fans have been used to light up builds for well over a decade now. But with more and more users showing off the inside of their clean builds, it was only a matter of time before RGB hit the interior lighting space. We checked out a ton of LED kits available to find the best way for you to light up your build. Here’s our favorites. Best basic LED kit LEDs are not addressable Only comes with two LED strips \nWhether you’re looking for a single color LED strip or a RGB solution to light up your build, we highly recommend the DeepCool RGB350 LED Kit. Priced at just $16.99, it’s only a few dollars higher than most single color LED kits but offers so much more. \nWith two included LED strips each measuring twelve inches, the RGB350 is capable of lighting up most small to medium sized builds. We used the mid-sized NZXT S340 for our testing and the build was easily lit up with just one strip on the top and one strip on the bottom. Installation was foolproof thanks to magnets built into the LED strips and an included extension cord. \nThe kit uses a wireless RGB controller that allows you to control the LED strips using an included remote control. All we had to do was connect the molex adapter to our power supply, chain the LED strips together and plug them into the RGB controller, and we were up and running in minutes. \nWhile the LED strips are technically RGB, it’s important to note that the LEDs are not addressable in a basic kit like this. This means data can only be transmitted to the entire strip at once rather than each individual LED on the strip. Therefore, every LED on the strip will be the same color at the same time. \nThe only things you’ll be able to control with the DeepCool RGB350 are the brightness, color and various flashing patterns. If you want a single color, you’ll be able to choose from 15 total colors on the remote. If you want multiple colors, you can cycle through the three basic red green and blue colors or a seven color rainbow with “breathing” or “skipping” effects in between each color change. The DeepCool RGB350 might not be advanced as the RGB mechanical keyboards on the market these days, but it surely gets the job done if you’re looking to light up your build on a budget. Comes with four addressable LED strips Expandable to eight total LED strips Reactive lighting modes including thermal and audio Expensive \nWhen it comes to lighting, NZXT has never been one to shy away from offering it wherever possible. The company’s earliest cases offered accent lighting well before it was popular so it really comes as no surprise that the company is leading the charge in RGB case lighting with the HUE+ Advanced PC Lighting Kit. \nThe HUE+ comes with ten individually addressable LEDs on each of its four strips. With a total of 40 LEDs and multiple extension cords included (2x 100mm, 1x 300mm and 1x 500mm), the HUE+ is capable of lighting up a wide range of build sizes. If you have a larger case or want even more RGB lighting, NZXT offers a HUE+ extension kit that has two additional LED strips. \nUnlike most RGB controllers out there, the HUE+ has two channels that support up to four of NZXT’s LED strips each. This means you can run two different lighting effects simultaneously with up to 40 LEDs on each channel. Controlled via the company’s CAM software, the HUE+ features eight basic preset modes and several advanced modes. \nSmart lighting modes allow HUE+ to automatically change colors based on CPU/GPU temperature or in-game FPS. Audio mode makes the lighting react like an equalizer effect to whatever audio is coming out of the PC. Finally, you can create your own lighting effects with the custom mode. \nInstallation for the HUE+ is very straightforward. The controller easily screws into any 2.5” hard drive slot. From there, you plug in a 4-pin molex for power and an internal micro USB cable for data. Finally, you decide how you want to distribute your LED strips over the two channels and plug them in using the included cables. \nConsidering the low cost of entire reels of addressable LED strips, the $60 price tag on the HUE+ may sound a bit unreasonable. But the functionality and ease of use offered by the included CAM software makes it more than worthwhile. For advanced users wanting even more customization and lighting, a custom DIY solution is the only way. Can be difficult to install/setup Advanced lighting requires basic coding \nThere are plenty of addressable RGB LED strips on the market today, but we found the WS2812B strips to be the most cost effective and versatile when it comes to lighting up a PC. Each 16.4ft spool comes with a whopping 300 LEDs that can be cut down to fit any sized PC. However, in addition to the LED strip you’ll have to purchase a separate controller and power supply . \nCutting the LED strip to wrap around the interior of the S340, we used less than half of the spool but still ended up with more than double the included LEDs in the HUE+. With 85 total LEDs, our DIY solution was far brighter with smoother color effects than any of the other kits we’ve tested. \nSeveral pre-programmed controllers are available that work just like the one in the DeepCool RGB350 but with hundreds of patterns and lighting combinations since the strip is addressable. More advanced users can use Arduino boards or a Raspberry Pi to program their own limitless lighting effects. For our DIY setup we decided to go with the simple route and used a remote controlled mini controller. \nInstallation was very similar to the RGB350 but can be much more difficult depending on the case you’re working with. Rather than cutting the spool into multiple strips, we used one long strip and routed it around the interior of the case. If you need to cut the strip into multiple pieces, you’ll have to do some basic soldering to connect the strips. (We’d recommend using 3-pin JST connectors so you can easily detach the strips without having to cut and re-solder) \nAfter we attached the LEDs to the case, we connected the mini controller using the included JST connector at the end of the strip. While a 5V molex adapter may work for a smaller number of LEDs, it’s better to power the controller with an external power supply with a current of 10A or higher. \nWith well over 100 unique lighting modes and the ability to adjust speed and brightness, we found the pre-programmed solution to be more than sufficient. You’ll have to do without the smart lighting modes found in the HUE+ but advanced users can replicate those modes and more with custom controllers. Totaling just a few dollars higher than a HUE+ with even more preset lighting options, the DIY solution is by far our top recommendation for PC lighting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:52:23.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
