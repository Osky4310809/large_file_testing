The report is currently under investigation by the university police department. Advertisement \nThe suspect—whose details are withheld in the police report, according to the Kansas City Star —is potentially facing charges of forcible rape, contributing to a child’s misconduct, furnishing alcohol to a minor, and possession of drug paraphernalia. The victim, who is not a Kansas student, was allegedly raped between 10 p.m. on Dec. 17 and 5 a.m. on Dec. 18. \nAccording to the Star, five Kansas players were cited as witnesses in the police report: Frank Mason III, Mitch Lightfoot, Lagerald Vick, Tucker Vang, and Josh Jackson. Two 19-year old women and an administrator in the Kansas athletic department were also interviewed as part of the rape investigation. The crime report was not posted on the Kansas University Police Department’s online daily crime log for several weeks, according to the Lawrence Journal-World ; the Journal-World reports that the majority of crime reports are posted “within a few days.” KU Police Chief Chris Keary “would not specify why posting the McCarthy report was delayed,” the Journal-World reported.

That police report, provided to the Star , didn’t provide any information about the child but did list as witnesses the same 19-year-old women as the other investigation as well as Jayhawks forward Carlton Bragg. \nWe will update this post with a copy of the police report if we can get one—the Lawrence Police Department told Deadspin a copy must be obtained in person or by mail after the department gets $2, with just check or cash accepted. \nWe reached out to Kansas assistant athletics director Chris Theisen, assistant communications director Brian Karst, and Kansas athletics spokesperson Jim Marchiony for comment. Only Theisen responded, saying he would forward our request to Marchiony, who never responded.
