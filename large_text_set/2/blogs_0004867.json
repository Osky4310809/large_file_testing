Donald Trump vows to overturn 'ridiculous' judge's block on travel ban \nShe said a supervisor at Turkish Airlines told her that people holding immigrant and non-immigrant visas from the seven countries still were being banned unless they had a special email from the US Customs and Border Protection with the person's name and passport number. \nA 12-year-old Yemeni girl whose parents and siblings are US citizens living in California was finally allowed to depart after \"an hour-and-a-half of fighting\" with officials, Ms Goldberg said. It was unclear when she would arrive. \nA Somali refugee said about 140 asylum seekers whose resettlement in the US was blocked by Mr Trump's executive order were sent back to their camp.
