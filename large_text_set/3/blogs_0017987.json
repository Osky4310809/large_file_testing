Because the Internet, there’s now a parody of a new song titled “Abracadabralifornia”… and it just might be the Peppers’ best work in over a decade. \nTry and imagine a totally self-aware Chili Peppers, in which references to the great state of California and Anthony Kiedis’ gumbo gibberish stand for nothing else but background noise. (Hasn’t that always been the case?) That’s exactly what “Abracadabralifornia” captures and, to be honest, I could laugh at this for hours. \nTo make things more “legit”, there’s a new site set up over at rhcp2014.com . It’s pretty flashy with gaudy ads for Pepsi, Dodge, Gatorade, and even KROQ. The latter inclusion makes us think it’s a joke from Kevin and Bean; after all, the band was just on their show this morning. Then again, comedian Tom Scharpling was one of the first to tweet the link. Whatever the case, we had a great laugh. \nUpdate: The song is actually from a Comedy Bang Bang podcast that aired last March titled “The Pepper Men.” Revisit that episode here . \nStream below or download here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:37:46.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
