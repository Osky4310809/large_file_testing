Even with financial aid, living away from home, or having a family of your own, can mean learning to balance your educational goals with financial obligations. But how do you make time for studying when you're also holding down a full- or part-time job? \nPractice these seven time management skills and you'll find that elusive balance between your health, happiness and GPA. Shutterstock 1. Get Organized \nThere's no room for carelessness when you're balancing work and school. Getting organized will help you sail through the challenges of life and avoid irritating hurdles. Create a designated study spot in a quiet corner of your home, and keep all of your school supplies there. Figure out what time of day you are most productive, and plan accordingly. \nRelated: How to Get Started with an Online Course Get Organized for Your Online Course Participate Fully in Your Online Course 5 Ways to Stay on Track 5 Myths of Online Education - Debunked! \ncontinue reading below our video 10 Best Universities in the United States Brigitte Sporrer - Cultura - Getty Images 155291948 2. Create and Communicate Your Schedule \nCreating a schedule is a crucial productivity tool, but beware of being too strict. Keep your schedule flexible enough that you can adjust when unexpected things happen. Be sure to share your schedule with family, friends and coworkers, asking them not to disturb you during study time. \nRelated: 8 Ways to Be Successful at School Christopher Kimmel - Getty Images 182655729 3. Set Realistic Goals \nSetting goals is important, but setting realistic goals is even more so. Prioritize your tasks and set reachable targets for each considering your skills and available time. Strive for achievement and not for perfection. A good GPA is desirable, but targeting straight A's can overburden you, leaving you exhausted and even depressed. Don't overcommit yourself, but instead focus on achieving realistic targets that you can celebrate. \nRelated: How to Write SMAART Goals and Objectives Reach Your Goal with a Learning Development Plan Reach Your Goal with a Learning Project Plan How to Choose Your Level of Success Bambu Productions - The Image Bank - Getty Images 83312607 4. Kick the Stress \nAccept it: The path you have chosen is stressful. To successfully balance work and school, you must learn to manage your anxiety in a way that doesn't leave you depressed. Take breaks when you need them, and pursue your hobbies, go out with friends and family, get enough sleep and have fun - but don't overdo it. And never pull an all-nighter! \nRelated: Photodisc - Getty Images 5. Hang Out with People Who Have Similar Goals \nI have suggested this tip to all my students and it does pay off. Having a friend who is seriously committed to the same goals as you are helps you in many ways. Not only does it foster a sense of healthy competition, but it drives you to achieve your academic goals in spite of job-related stress. Moreover, similar-minded friends can be great motivators and help you stay on track. It always helps to be part of an active community. \nRelated: Photodisc - Getty Images 6. Know When to Say \"No\" \nThis is not the time for assuming any new family responsibilities. Neither is it time for being overly generous. Learn to say \"no\" to things that create a hindrance in either your job or your studies. Consider sharing your load with your family. \nRelated: 10 Ways to Be a Great Student Rick Gomez - Blend Images - Getty Images 508482053 7. Remember Why You Started It can be overwhelming at times to manage a job and school simultaneously, but it's not rocket science. Others have already tread on the same path, so why can't you? Believe in yourself and remember why you decided to take this route. Whether you're hoping to advance your career through earning a second degree or you're simply looking to better yourself intellectually, the stress and sacrifices will ultimately be worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:47:35.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
