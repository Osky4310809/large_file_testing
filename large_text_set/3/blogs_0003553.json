GG Adam Romero, Senior Counsel and Arnold D. Kassoy Scholar of Law at the Williams Institute \nOn March 2, 2017, sixty scholars who study the transgender population–many of whom are affiliated with the Williams Institute–filed an amici curiae brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in Gloucester County School Board v. GG . The case concerns a transgender student’s access to school facilities consistent with his gender identity. In their brief, the scholars provide the court with relevant social science and other research describing the demographics of the transgender population and the pervasive discrimination and stigmatization transgender people face on account of their non-conformity to gender norms. In particular, amici present research finding that discrimination against and stigmatization of transgender students in schools is pervasive, negatively impacts their equal access to education, and threatens their future economic prospects, physical health, and emotional well-being. \nThe brief was co-authored by Adam P. Romero, Senior Counsel and Arnold D. Kassoy Scholar of Law at the Williams Institute, and pro bono co-counsel from Sidley Austin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:17:16.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
