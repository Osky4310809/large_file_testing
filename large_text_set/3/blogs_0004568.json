It’s a bit like how electrical signals tell your muscles to change shape when you flex or grip, but all done at the behest of onboard virtual intelligence telling the tire what shape will best help it maintain traction and control given the current state of the road beneath it. \nImagine a future where you don’t need winter tires even if you live in Minnesota, or where your Tesla adapts to have racing slicks when you’re taking it out for a track day automatically. Intelligence and adaptability built into a tire is also another way that autonomous vehicle makers can take risk out of the equation for the most unpredictable parts of driving, including how weather impacts the road. \nLocalized AI applications like this are made possible by a growing category of embedded processor and GPU options from companies including Nvidia that make it possible to enact machine learning “at the edge,” or where sensing actually happens, instead of having to shuttle that information back to big data centres and then out again. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:20:01.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
