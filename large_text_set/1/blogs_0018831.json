The Women’s Marches may be over now, but the spirit of that day doesn’t have to be: Not by a longshot. \nPresident Trump has recognized the rights of the people to peacefully protes t , but there’s still plenty of battles to be won, and much to be done to make sure that happens. \nOne organization in particular, EMILY’S List , took it one step further. While the group regularly works to get pro-choice, diverse groups (both in race and sexual orientation) of women elected to office (US Senators members Tammy Duckworth, Kamala Harris —both of whom were at the Women’s March yesterday — and Patty Murray are among their featured candidates), today was something extraordinary. \nFollowing the Women’s Marches and on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, they held a “ Getting Ready to Run ” training session, and the interest they received was utterly thrilling: A group 500 women signed up to learn how to actually become a part of the machine they’re unhappy with in an effort to make a lasting change. \n“Today, we trained 500 women to run for office,” the company shared on its Instagram page. “They’re first-time candidates, driven by this election to make their voices heard. And we can’t wait to see everything they accomplish. Keep an eye out for them on a ballot near you soon! #ReadytoRun.” \nHow freaking cool is that? They say every cloud has a silver lining, and if having more bright, kickass and diverse females representing us is the lining of a cloud that has been our gender issue struggles, we are HERE for it. \nGo gem ’em, ladies — we can’t wait to you on the ballot! \nWould you run for office if you got training? Tell us why or why not @BritandCo ! \n(h/t @emilyslist , photos via Paul Morigi/Getty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T02:29:39.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
