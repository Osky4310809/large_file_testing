Get down!'” \nAfter Bowers got on the ground, he said he saw another man with a gun approaching. The tirade of expletives with the gun pointed at Bowers’ head continued. \nHis wife, Toi Bowers, said she saw her husband on the ground with guns on either side of him. \n“I started screaming and swearing and saying, ‘You’re not going to hurt him!'” \nThe two men fled in a car, and within minutes of the robbery, Bowers said his credit card was used at a nearby BP gas station and a McDonald’s. \n“It’s wrong for you to come out and try to take a man’s life and take him away from his family,” Kelvin Bowers says. <script src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6\" async></script> <div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/suzanne.lemignot/videos/1240660592668167/\"></div> <p> Suzanne Le Mignot facebook Follow Suzanne Le Mignot serves as CBS 2 Chicago’s general assignment reporter during the week.
