By late adolescence, they were twice as likely to drink “regularly and persistently”. \nThese kids were also 50% more likely to smoke cannabis occasionally than their less academic friends and twice as likely to use it persistently. \nResearchers found that these patterns persisted into adulthood - refuting the notion that clever young people are more likely to temporarily “experiment” with these substances. \nDr James Williams at UCL Medical School told the Telegraph that these “risky” health behaviours present “a large problem in terms of public health”. \n“Substance use is a risk factor for immediate and long-term health problems, as well as negative non-health outcomes such as poor educational and employment outcomes,” he said. \n“The outcomes of cannabis use were found to be worsened by early onset and increased frequency use.” \nHowever, he added that teenagers are now less likely to smoke cannabis or drink alcohol than they have been in the past.
