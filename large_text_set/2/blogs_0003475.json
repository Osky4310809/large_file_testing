That would be Chrissy Teigen, who watched the game with her husband and jazz-fusion icon John Legend in NRG Stadium. Unlike Brady, who, y’know, had to play football, Teigen was free to get tipsy.\nAnd by tipsy, I mean, the night ended with her sitting down on an escalator, asking “who’s f*cking tonight?” while cackling like a crazy person. Been there.\nTeigen started off strong — “6 hot dogs before projectile vomiting last year. Let’s see how much I’ve grown,” she wrote in the late-afternoon — and only got stronger. After a drink (or six), Teigen tweeted, “hi Houston, New Yorker here, it’s actually pronounced house-ton I’m drunk,” before adding, “oh my god there is a street in New York pronounced House-ton and everyone says Houston and New Yorkers love correcting people A .” Then, to prove she and Legend were actually there, came the videos and photos.\n\npic.twitter.com/IgncfIADR7 \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 5, 2017 \nThings, they are a happening pic.twitter.com/JqDrnf70KL \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 6, 2017 \nHD 1 pic.twitter.com/jFvXyETDzg \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 5, 2017 \n\nSafe to say, those nachos probably won’t be in Teigen’s next cookbook. She’ll be too busy focusing on her next career as a play-by-play commentator.\nCan you put the ball under your shirt or into your pants\n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 6, 2017 \nSports person audition pic.twitter.com/Q7xLrsWUoO \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 6, 2017 \nI just keep yelling things like \"WE GOT S BALLGAME\"\n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 6, 2017 \nTHINGS ARE HAPPENING pic.twitter.com/XCFaHBwV8C \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nIn the game’s second half, Fox showed viewers at home all the celebrities in attendance, including Mark Wahlberg, Elton John, and Teigen, who accidentally brought #NippleGate back to Houston (vaguely NSFW?).\nboom goes the dynamite https://t.co/WAExp536Q7 \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 6, 2017 \n\nRather than be unnecessarily embarrassed by something 99.8% of onlookers didn’t notice, Teigen owned it and made the next Best Live Action Short Film.\n\npic.twitter.com/vBP5V9OJDp \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 6, 2017 \n\nAn Oscar is much cooler than a Super Bowl ring, anyway.\n(Via Twitter )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:28:37.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
