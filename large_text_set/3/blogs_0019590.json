For real, though, it’s here! \nAndroid O will introduce new features by way of background limits on apps (think battery life boost), notification channels (more control over notifications), picture-in-picture, adaptive icons, autofill in apps, and more. Full details on what’s new can be found here . \nThe new version of Android will run through four preview versions, with preview 2 hitting in mid-May, preview 3 in mid-June, preview 4 likely some time in August, and then the final release in Q3. It’s a similar schedule to last year’s Android N preview program. \nThe first Android O Developer Preview is available for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player. \nYou can download the Preview 1 images right here . Instructions on how to flash a factory image can be found here . Android O is now a part of the Android Beta at this time because it’s a hella-early developer build that probably isn’t all that stable. Post navigation \nGoogle releases Android O preview & Motorola still has me on Marshmallow. \n:sads: \nLooking forward to the O update on my Droid Turbo OG. Daniel Thomas \nIs the below sentence a typo? Should it read, “Android O is NOT…”? The way it’s written is confusing. \n“Android O is now a part of the Android Beta at this time because it’s a hella-early developer build that probably isn’t all that stable.” James \nI still have problems with notifications not arriving when Doze kicks in. Hopefully this helps. ynksbsbll2 \nPossible typo: The last sentence says it’s now part of the beta, I believe it should say it’s NOT part of the beta Tyler Durden \nOh background limits nice. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/61dd0c738f55605e50997174a75c2389e8f17bb2156907c8cd33631a80c418db.png Trooper311 \nLol indeed. Trooper311 \nNow is when I wish I got my PIxel from the Google Store instead of big red. But, I can wait. Brian Himes \nNot sure why the Verizon vairent would be a problem. You can do the beta on either. Wolfgang71 \nWith that icon for the new O release, makes me think orange creamsicle. Cael \nIt’s going to be Oreo. ali jawad", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:00:19.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
