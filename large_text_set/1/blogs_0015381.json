The attack marks a significant setback for efforts to achieve peace in the region. \nThe blast hit the joint operational mechanism base in the city of Gao, home to Malian soldiers and hundreds of former fighters who had signed a peace agreement with the government. Dismembered bodies could still be seen two hours after the blast. \nThe death toll rose over the course of Wednesday morning and had reached more than 50 by 1.30pm local time (1330 GMT), a military official said. \nSadou Maiga, a doctor at Gao’s hospital, said all other hospital activities had ceased, with dozens of wounded victims arriving. “Some have died from their wounds, and others are in a very grave state,” he said. “At this point, it’s not the toll of dead and injured that interests me, it’s saving who I can.” \nWitnesses said the car bearing explosives breached the camp at about 9am, just as hundreds of fighters were gathering for a meeting. The suicide bomber “succeeded in tricking soldiers’ vigilance” and penetrated the camp, said army spokesman Col Diarran Kone. \nWednesday’s attack underscores the enormous challenges that remain in northern Mali four years after the French military led an intervention to drive jihadis from power in the major towns across the north. The peace agreement has proved difficult to implement and unpopular with the forces wreaking havoc in the region. \nThe former fighters who signed the 2015 peace deal include ethnic Tuareg secular rebels who once fought the Malian military. Now they are supposed to be forming joint patrols in the area, though the program has yet to begin. \nMali has become the world’s deadliest UN peacekeeping mission. Twenty-nine UN peacekeepers were killed last year in attacks blamed on armed jihadi groups, according to a Human Rights Watch report released on Wednesday. \nThe report details how extremists are extending their reach further into central Mali, trying to implement their strict interpretation of sharia law and pressuring families to give up their children as soldiers for the cause. It also denounces rising levels of banditry, a phenomenon victims say is fuelled by the slow implementation of the 2015 peace accord. \nMalian security minister Salif Traore declined to respond to the report’s specifics but said he was well aware of security challenges throughout the region.
