It’s called the Wonderboom and offers a slightly different design when compared with some other popular UE speakers, like the Boom 2 for example. It is both shorter as well as thicker and comes in six different colors: Stone (gray), Phantom (black), Fireball (red), SubZero (blue), Cashmere (pink), and Lilac (purple).\nThe small and portable speaker is shock resistant and will keep you entertained for around 10 hours before it runs out of juice. It should survive and keep on playing music even if dropped from a height of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters). The device is also waterproof (IPX7 rating) and features an extended wireless range of up to 100 feet (30 meters).\nSee also: Best Bluetooth Speakers of 2017 March 27, 2009 It has large plus and minus buttons that make it easy for you to turn the volume up or down and also sports another button on top, which allows you to play, pause and skip tracks.
