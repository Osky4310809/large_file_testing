Ferguson was manager at United for 27 years between 1986 and 2013 \n\"The thing is, we've never won the Europa League,\" Ferguson told ESPN . \"We never won the UEFA Cup, what it used to be. \n\"And we've got a great draw. I'm not saying it's a certainty, but they've got a great chance. \n\"It's still a European trophy. And if you win it, you get into the Champions League. The incentive is greater to do that.\" Upgrade to Sky Sports now and get 12 months for just Â£18 per month! Ferguson oversaw his first Champions League triumph against Bayern Munich in 1999 \nFerguson, who was in charge at Old Trafford for 27 years, won two Champions League trophies and a Cup Winners' Cup while at United, but English clubs have failed to win a European title since Chelsea's Europa League win in 2013. \n\"In the '70s, Ajax and Bayern Munich; '80s, Liverpool; '90s Italy, AC Milan. And then England had a great spell,\" the 75-year-old Scot added. Ferguson won his second Champions League title in 2008 \n\"At the moment, the cycle is with the Spanish teams. And they're best, that's why they're winning it.\" \nUnited play Belgian side Anderlecht away in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final on April 13, before hosting Rene Weiler's side at Old Trafford in the return leg a week later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T11:46:59.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
