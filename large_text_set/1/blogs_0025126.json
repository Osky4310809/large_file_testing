(AP Photo/Aaron Favila) \nVenus Williams is back in a Grand Slam singles final for the first time since 2009. She could be squaring off with her younger sister Serena, but Venus Williams’s accomplishment Thursday deserves savoring on its own. \nAt 36, the 13th-seeded Williams had already made history as the oldest woman to reach the Australian Open semifinals. Once there, she dispatched unseeded American CoCo Vandeweghe, 6-7 (7-3), 6-2, 6-3, to reach the final in Melbourne for the first time since 2003. \n— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 26, 2017 \nIn the other semifinal, played after Williams-Vandeweghe, second-seeded Serena Williams was set to take on unseeded Croatian Mirjana Lucic-Baroni. Serena Williams defeated her older sister for that 2003 Aussie Open title, and she was seeking her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, one less than Margaret Court’s all-time record. \n“Oh my gosh, it means so much, mostly because she played so well,” an ecstatic Venus Williams said of her victory over Vandeweghe, 25, in an on-court interview after their match. “There was never a moment of relaxation, ever, so to be able to get to the final through a match like this, I’m just, I’m excited about American tennis, as well.” \n“Everyone has their moment in the sun, maybe mine has gone on a while, but I’d like to keep that going. I’ve got nothing else to do, so let’s keep it going,” Williams added with a laugh. \nPlaying in her record 73rd Grand Slam event, Williams will try to win her first major title since Wimbledon in 2008, when she defeated her sister in the final. Serena Williams avenged that defeat at the following Wimbledon, Venus’s final appearance in a Grand Slam singles final before Saturday. \nVenus Williams has seven Grand Slam singles titles overall, all at Wimbledon or the U.S. Open, so she will be seeking her first Australian Open championship. She’s the oldest woman in a Grand Slam final since Martina Navratilova (37, the oldest in the Open era) at Wimbledon in 1994, but remarkably, either of her potential opponents are barely younger, given that Serena Williams is 35 and Lucic-Baroni is 34. \nVandeweghe was playing in her first Grand Slam semifinal. The niece of NBA executive and former player Kiki Vandeweghe, she had knocked out No. 1 seed Angelique Kerber and No. 7 Garbine Muguruza in the previous two rounds. sports Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T08:57:11.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
