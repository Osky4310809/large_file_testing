(Photo: AP, WireImage) \nIn the wake of news that Mary Tyler Moore has died at age 80 , fans are remembering the TV icon's roles on The Dick Van Dyke Show , The Mary Tyler Moore Show and a television appearance made outside of a scripted comedy -- when she surprised Oprah. \nOprah has called Moore an inspiration and \"one of the greatest ever,\" so she was shocked when Moore phoned into The Oprah Winfrey Show back in 1993, and completely overwhelmed when Moore showed up, in person, to a 1997 episode. \nWhen Moore appeared, Oprah cried and kept looking at the actress in disbelief. \"Let me just say, you have no idea what you've meant to me,\" she told her idol. \"You were the light. Every Saturday night (I'd watch you) while I was conditioning my hair ... I wanted to work in Minneapolis with you.\" \nAfter Moore exited, Oprah told her audience, \"I need to calm down. Can I have a Kleenex to get the river that's running under my armpits. Oh, boy!\" \nThe TV clip is making the rounds on Twitter.
