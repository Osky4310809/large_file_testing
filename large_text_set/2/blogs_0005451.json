The last time it happened, it was Janet Jackson’s nipple popping out and saying hello during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show with Justin Timberlake. \nThanks to Chrissy Teigen and a creeper at home with eagle eyes, our streak of nipple-less Super Bowls is over. If you’d like to click here , you’ll kinda see a nipple. I don’t know how he saw it, because I couldn’t see anything until he zoomed all the way in. Some men throw touchdown passes, others can spot a nipple from a thousand yards during a Super Bowl party. \nTeigen, who had a great time all night , had some fun with it.\nboom goes the dynamite https://t.co/WAExp536Q7 \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 6, 2017 \n@chrissyteigen I believe it's \"boob goes the dynamite\".\n— Rob Wong (@WongSN590) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nI’m guessing as someone that has had their nipples on display professionally, she doesn’t care one bit about this. It’s just a nipple. It’s not her social security number. This isn’t going to damage her career. Her history shows she would probably like her nipple out in the world more.\nTwo years ago, Teigen got into a thing with Instagram, which deleted a picture she posted of herself topless. She re-posted a bunch of times with different filters to no avail, as she was annoyed that men could post shirtless pics but women could not. \n\n\nInstagram may have won that round, but she did her best to protest the sexist, unfair standard that is preventing us from seeing her nipples.\n\nWell, there you have it. That’s everything we’ve got about a famous person’s nipples. I hope you enjoyed this sports post.\n( Chrissy Teigen on Twitter )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:55:41.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
