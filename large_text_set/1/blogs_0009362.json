Police swooped on the suspects in dawn raids (Photo: E-PRESS / XPOSUREPHOTOS.COM) The accused were held in custody at the Prefecture de Police de Paris (Photo: E-PRESS / XPOSUREPHOTOS.COM) \n\"I welcome this with great satisfaction,\" said Mr Veil, who said he was due to discuss details of the raids with Ms Kardashian when she woke up in Los Angeles today. \n\"These arrests are a nice surprise because on the one hand, it will perhaps make it possible to find the jewellery,\" said Mr Veil. \n\"On the other hand, it puts an end to the outrageous speculation by some, who thought it was intelligent to pretend that this robbery was staged, or a publicity stunt organised by Ms Kardashian.\" \nMr Veil indicated that Ms Kardashian would look forward ‘putting her nose up’ at those who had doubted her word.

I think she was recently shocked and had the opportunity to say so on television. \n\"The money she lost during this robbery is not the only issue. Even though my client was not injured, this assault was very brutal and traumatic. Imagine yourself alone, at night, in front of armed people.\" \nMs Kardashian feared ‘they're going to shoot me in the back,’ she said this weekend on Keeping up with the Kardashians , adding: \"There's no way out. It makes me so upset to think about it.\" \nMs Kardashian, was tied up and locked a bathroom as the gang fled with jewellery including a ring worth around four million pound, and a case of jewellery worth five million. The speculation has been 'outrageous' says Jean Veil (Photo: Getty) \nThe gang escaped on bicycles but one of them dropped a diamond pendant worth around 28,000 pounds in the street outside. \nIt was found by a woman who handed it in to police, as grainy CCTV of the men on bikes also emerged. \nAfter months of detailed police work, DNA has now been found in the Hotel de Pourtales – also known as the ‘No Address’, which is close to the U.S. Embassy in the French capital. \nThe forensics material matches that of a well-known armed robber with a number of convictions whom another officer described as a ‘major thug’.

All the others arrested were linked to him. \nThe 72-year-old is part of a diverse network of alleged criminals spanning different communities across France and Belgium. \nAs well as Pierre B. – who made millions through counterfeit money – those arrested include three women, and two diamond dealers. \nSome of the women are thought to have been involved in trailing Ms Kardashian around Paris before the October 3 heist. \nA police source said: \"Coordinated raids took place at 6am today. The suspects were arrested at addresses in greater Paris and in the Gard department. \n\"The oldest suspect is 72, while others are in their 50s and 60s. All are well known to the police.\" \nMs Kardashian, who flew out of Paris within hours of her ordeal, will now have to undergo the ordeal of watching a video of all the men, and may also have to attend an identity parade in Paris.

This may be necessary for the investigations, but it will be for the investigating judge to decide.\" \nDNA samples that ultimately led to today’s arrests were found on a piece of tape used to gag Ms Kardashian, and also on the pendant that the gang dropped in the street. \nAfter three months of checks, the forensic samples were finally found to correspond to one of the gang.
