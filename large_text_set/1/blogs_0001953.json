When the Broncos won Super Bowl 50 in February 2016, that gave Peyton Manning a window to walk away, his legacy secure. That catapulted Von Miller to a $114.5 million contract . That made Broncos general manager John Elway the envy of MVPs after their playing days are over. \nThe title also took away one more piece of motivation for Broncos coach Gary Kubiak to continue grinding away at an all-consuming job. Winning a Super Bowl makes you a champion. A second title is gravy. Kubiak told his players Sunday he will resign. An official announcement is expected Monday. \nBut during a season-ending 24-6 victory Sunday over the playoff-bound Oakland Raiders, Kubiak punted on a looming quarterback battle, setting aside the future to win one final game in a lost season, one last victory in what is probably the coach’s final game with the Broncos. \nAfter the game, Kubiak predicted a terrific battle between quarterbacks Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch next season. \nSiemian went the distance, throwing for 206 yards and two touchdowns as Denver finished 9-7, a sixth consecutive winning season. He did not settle any debates. Questions about the future of their quarterbacks will only intensify for the Broncos and their next head coach. \nKubiak said last week, with reservations, that he would like to split time between Siemian and Lynch against Oakland. Siemian deserved one more start, Kubiak said, and Lynch would get some seasoning. But Lynch never played, even after the Broncos built a commanding lead and held it for most of the second half against a Raiders team using its third-string quarterback. \n“That’s on me,” Kubiak said after the game. “I planned on playing them both. I told them at halftime that Trevor would keep going. And we’ll go from there.” \nEarly in the game the Broncos solved some of the offensive problems that vexed them since November. A 1-4 stretch through Christmas knocked the Broncos from the playoffs, as Denver’s running attack disappeared and Siemian struggled to get first downs, let alone many points. \nIn the first half Sunday, the Broncos’ ground game suddenly resurfaced. Rookie Devontae Booker ran in an 11-yard touchdown to cap an eight-play, 84-yard drive. It was Denver’s first rushing touchdown on an opening drive this season. \nAnd Justin Forsett, the veteran running back who was cut by two teams this season, broke a 64-yard run up the middle in the second quarter. It was Denver’s longest run of the season. He gained more yards on that play than the Broncos did rushing in total last week at Kansas City (63). It led to a Brandon McManus 22-yard field goal and a Broncos’ 10-0 lead. \nA personal pick of Kubiak’s in the seventh round out of Northwestern in 2015, Siemian was a third-stringer last season behind Manning and Brock Osweiler . Kubiak made him the starting quarterback this season for his steady presence during training camp, beating out Lynch and veteran Mark Sanchez . \n“I owe him a lot,” Siemian said of Kubiak. “I had no business being drafted. No business really being around. He got me in the door and gave me a chance to play. I have to push on.” \nAgainst Oakland, Siemian was 12-for-17 for 150 yards and a 117.3 passer rating in just the first two quarters — his best first half this season. His 43-yard scoring pass to Booker led to a 17-0 lead at intermission. And in the second half, Siemian threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Virgil Green that gave Denver a 24-0 lead. The Broncos scored more touchdowns Sunday then they did in all of December.
