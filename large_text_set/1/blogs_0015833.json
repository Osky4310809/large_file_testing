There are no live trees in the enclosure,\" Scorpion's programme director Gunung Gea told the BBC. \nHe said that activists had been periodically visiting the bears to feed them fruit, which is part of their natural diet. 'Soul-destroying' \n\"The fact that you can see their ribs, that is certainly not normal. They are underfed,\" said Gabriella Fredriksson from the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \nMs Fredriksson, who is co-chair of the sun bear expert committee, told the BBC that a sun bear eating faeces may be exhibiting \"extreme boredom\". \n\"Sun bears are very active animals. If they are stuck in a concrete pit with nothing to do, no stimulation for climbing and digging, it's soul destroying to say the least,\" she said. \nThe concrete floors would also damage their soft feet, while the lack of shade may cause cataracts in sun bears which are used to living in dimmer environments. Image copyright Scorpion Wildlife Trade Monitoring Group Image caption One bear is seen eating its own faeces immediately after defecation, a possible sign of extreme boredom, says one expert \nMr Gea said that the other animals in the zoo also appeared to be in poor condition. Other videos taken by the group show deer with skin conditions, and chained-up elephants. \nReviews on travel rating website Tripadvisor of the zoo have been universally critical, with many saying the animals appeared neglected and in distress. \n\"A horrible place, hell on Earth for all these poor animals. Rusty cages, dirty place and really neglected animals,\" wrote one reviewer. 'Old case' \nBut Bandung Zoo spokesman Sudaryo dismissed the issue as an \"old case\". He told BBC Indonesian that they feed the bears regularly and also conduct regular health checks. \n\"We provide enough food... People say they are thin, but does (that) mean they are not healthy and they are not eating? It's not,\" he said. \nHe added that the bears were begging \"because there are people who throw food at them\", and that the zoo has told visitors to stop this practice. \nThe zoo last made the news in May 2016 after activists highlighted the plight of Yani, an elephant that died from an unknown disease. The zoo was said to have failed to give adequate medical care. \nBandung's mayor, Ridwan Kamil, told reporters last year that he had no power to shut down the zoo as it was privately run. \nA Jakarta Globe report in 2015 said that out of the 58 registered zoos in Indonesia, only four were found to be \"decent and appropriate\". \nThe controversy over Bandung Zoo follows that of the zoo in Surabaya, dubbed by some the \"zoo of death\" after several animal deaths in recent years.
