So if your Wii U or 3DS is lost, broken or stolen, you'll have to actually phone Nintendo and beg them to let you reclaim any games on a replacement platform - and even then you'll need to provide serial numbers for Nintendo to issue a transfer.\nBut that's all set to change with the Switch. As discovered by eagle-eyed Twitter user Bjoern the Switchy , there's a small disclaimer in YouTuber FloKO' unboxing video that notes the following:\n\"Your Nintendo Account contains your Nintendo eShop purchase history and current balance. By re-linking your Nintendo Account after initializing the console, it will be possible to redownload any software or DLC purchased using that account. (Software that has been discontinued may not be available to redownload in some cases.)\"\nSo there you have it: Nintendo is finally joining the modern age of digital licenses! That's a switch I can get behind.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqVa1MB90PU", "https://twitter.com/BjoernTheSmexy/status/832419152740626433"], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:28:36.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
