The track, called \"Shining,\" dropped exclusively on Tidal (because, duh) and features Bey's iconic vocals and her rapper hubby's signature rhymes. \nSafe to say it won't take any time at all for \"Shining\" to dominate the top of the charts. The single's cover art is pretty darn cute as well, as Khaled's son Asahd Tuck Khaled , who he welcomed last October with fiancé Nicole Tuck , poses in a black and white tuxedo under a spotlight. Photos \n2017 Grammys Red Carpet Candid Moments \nMeanwhile, Queen Bey experienced quite a night at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. Between making her baby bump debut with a stunning performance dedicated to the Knowles-Carter fam's soon-to-be bundles of joy, two wins for Best Music Video and Best Contemporary Album, and daughter Blue Ivy Carter 's can't-miss cameos , the night belonged to the Lemonade artist. \nBeyoncé broke down in tears as Adele accepted   an incredibly competitive category she was also nominated in. The 25 performer praised Bey for her limitless accomplishments in the music biz, telling her directly onstage, \"The Lemonade album was so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful and soul baring. We got to see a side of you that you don't always let us see.\" \nAs for DJ Khaled, he received two nominations of his own for Best Rap Album and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. \nListen to a teaser of \"Shining\" above and tell us what you think in the comments!
