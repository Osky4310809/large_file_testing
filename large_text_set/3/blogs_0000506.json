WGC-Mexico Championship: Articles, photos and videos \n“A little bit disappointed with the way I finished, but overall if you had told me at the start of the week that I would be leading by two going into the weekend, I definitely would have taken it,” McIlroy said. \nMcIlroy lost a playoff at the BMW SA Open in mid-January before being diagnosed with a hairline rib fracture that kept him from starts in Los Angeles and last week’s Honda Classic . \nAlthough he said he normally starts each year well after extended layoffs, this time was different. \n“I've exceeded my expectations coming into the week,” he said. “I would have liked to have said coming in here yeah, I'm going to just get straight back at it and contend for the win or whatever, but I'm sort of a bit more realistic than that.” \nEven more impressive has been how well McIlroy has played considering he was slowed the last two days with a stomach virus, but after getting 12 hours of sleep on Thursday his outlook had brightened on Day 2 in Mexico.
