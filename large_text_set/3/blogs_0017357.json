Check out those cool upside-down-L-shaped parts on the wing that frame the nose, for one. \nIf you’ve always wanted to own some crazy pieces from a Formula One team, now is your chance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:23:58.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
