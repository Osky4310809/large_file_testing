Former International cricketer Virender Sehwag took a jibe at Gurmmeher’s placard which stated that Pakistan did not kill her father but the war did. Sehwag replied to the 20-year-old saying that he did not score two triple hundreds but his bat did, something which Bollywood star Randeep Hooda found funny and retweeted. And ever since the matter picked up steam on social media, celebrities all over the country have taken sides. Sportspersons such as Babita Phogat and Yogeshwar Dutt too commented on the matter saying that such comments against the nation would not be tolerated. Meanwhile, MoS Kiren Rijiju said that leftists had polluted the mind of the 20-year-old and she was merely a political tool in the larger scheme of things. \nAlso watch: \nBollywood Veteran Javed Akhtar, meanwhile hit back at Rijiju saying that he knew who was polluting the minister’s mind. Meanwhile, a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad took out a Tiranga march in Delhi University, several protest marches and counter-marchers were expected at the Delhi University and Jawahar Lal University campuses Today. The march, led by DU and JNU’s teachers and students and joined by All India Students Association members started from the Khalsa College in the North Campus to the Arts Faculty. \n— Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) February 26, 2017 How’s DU violence connected 2 @mehartweets appeal to get rid of hate?
