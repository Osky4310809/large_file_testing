Our winner, junior producer James Nosek almost dipped into the 4’s with a 5.03. Impressively, this matches Miami Guard Danny Isidora’s sprint from this year. He weighs in at 306 lbs. (Isidora, that is. Nosek clocks in at a lithe 175.) The Pillar Jump \nSince we didn’t have the Vertec, we marked the height on one of our pillars. Senior video producer Michael Sneeden won this one, with a vertical of 25 inches, enough to match up with Collin Buchanan, a hefty 316-pound offensive lineman from Miami of Ohio. The Broad Jump \nThis was another straightforward one — a flat-footed attempt, jumping as far out as possible. Our female winner, social media editor Paige Carlotti, jumped out of the gym with an admirable 7 feet, 4 inches. Although this doesn’t compare with this year’s bunch, Paige equaled the worst attempt from last year, courtesy of Landon Turner of UNC. (Apologies, Ms. Carlotti.) The 3-Pillar Drill \nIn the spirit of our new open office, we put our agility drill in the center of the room. Sure, we didn’t have the same setup that the NFL does, but it’s safe to assume that our scores are on par with the most out-of-shape 300-plussers in the pros. The Pushup Contest \nAlthough we do have a bench press in our office, we went with a pushup contest to finish each staffer’s combine. Commissioner, former Air Force Sergeant, and current web producer Barry Knoblach took the gold with 57 pushups in one minute. The most that an NFL player has ever consecutively bench-pressed 225 pounds in the combine is a mind-boggling 51 times, that record set by Justin Ernest in 1999. Knoblach estimates he could do 3. \nBefore we began, we realized it would be a shame if there wasn’t some video footage to watch after the fact. It turned out to be beneficial in more ways than one — although our senior associate online editor Christa Sgobba blew the scouts/coworkers away with her incredible 56-pushup performance, she insists that her no-reps weren’t fair. Check the tapes, Sgobba!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T06:11:47.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
