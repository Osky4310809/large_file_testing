Despite the well-documented softening of the luxury market, the uppermost echelon of real estate in the city is still, well, ridiculous. Even though there are fewer unfathomably expensive listings than in previous iterations of this list, some of the usual suspects—a nearly $100 million penthouse at 432 Park Avenue , an opulent Upper East Side townhouse with Hermès leather walls, and overpriced combo units—remain. \nWe last took stock of the top end of inventory last November, and this go-round, several stalwarts have been taken off the market (goodbye, once again, One Beacon Court penthouse ) allowing in plenty of fresh picks. The lower end of the list this time around is now hovering around $42 million, which isn't cheap, but it's lower than we've seen in a while—chalk it up to the ridiculous world of NYC real estate. And even as the list's high and low ends fluctuate, one thing remains the same: the properties are all in Manhattan, and they're all very expensive. 1 834 Fifth Avenue, 7/8A \n$96,000,000 \nNYC's most expensive home for sale is still this co-op at 834 Fifth Avenue, which hit the market in April and pole-vaulted its way to the top of this list. But it's gotten a major price cut since then, going from $120 million to $96 million. (Which, you know, is still not chump change.) The apartment is located on the building's seventh and eighth floors, and has 20 (!) rooms spread out over 12,000 square feet. It has many of the amenities found in these types of NYC apartments (by which we mean \"very expensive and over-the-top\"), including a wine cellar, a gallery, a \"grand marble staircase,\" and an enormous master suite. 834 5th Ave", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:02:42.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
