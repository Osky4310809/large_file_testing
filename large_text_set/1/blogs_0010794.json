Now, the bookseller has suspended sales of the new Nook tablet, less that two months after it launched.\nSee also: Best tablets under $100 3 weeks ago The official Barnes and Noble web site currently shows that the Nook tablet “is not available” and 9to5Google adds that the tablet has also been removed from its brick-and-mortar book stores.\nThis news comes after an anonymous employee posted on Reddit that the company sent word to its stores to remove them and ship all of them back to the company earlier this week, with no explanation as to why it was issuing this silent recall.\nAs it turns out, Barnes and Noble made this move because of a faulty charging adapter that was included with the tablet. Android Police finally got a statement from a company spokesperson, stating it had received three reports that the casing for the tablet’s charging adapter broke apart while still in the socket.\nThe company stated that all current Nook tablet owners should “stop using the adapter until we provide a replacement adapter.” It plans to issue a more formal public recall with the help of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nTo make matters worse, in December, it was discovered that the tablet had the same ADUPS software that was found in some smartphones made by BLU. That software secretly sent info from those smartphones to a server in China.\nAt that time, Barnes and Noble stated that the version of ADUPS on its Nook tablet was not collecting or sending personal info and it planned to issue an update in the near future that would ditch the software from the tablet entirely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:10:58.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
