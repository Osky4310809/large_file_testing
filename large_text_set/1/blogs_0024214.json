Amidst deciding who gets to keep what … comes the delicate issue of friends. Yup, the same wonderful friends who were partying and laughing with you and caring for and loving you barely weeks ago are now torn. Sometimes couples put emotional pressure on their friends to show “loyalty” and choose. Friends get so bewildered when a couple in their circle split. How can their affections change overnight? Just because a couple stopped loving each other, does that mean friends who care need to? What if they share an amazing rapport with both? Why should they even be made to choose, or feel guilty for not doing so. When two dear friends of mine broke up, there were huge issues in whom to invite for outings and get-togethers since naturally the two couldn’t be called. I toyed between x and y, turn by turn, and then I was met with teary and fiery attacks and made to feel like I was a bad friend because “I knew her first”.\nSo I decided only if she was busy would I invite him. However, even this didn’t sit too well and I realised she wanted me to cut all contact and ties. I found this hugely unfair, dominating and disrespectful. I spent years bonding with and liking both of them. They both mattered. They were both my friends and friendship isn’t a tap that can be turned on or off. So, I told her I was being respectful to her pain, but would not disrespect any friendship. To my horror, she disconnected from me. And then I realised it was a blessing. Anyone who can do that, isn’t a friend in the first place. And what of the classic “break up and make up” scenario, when friends take sides and the couple gets back together? AHA! We all know what happens then! So… value your old friends and respect the new ones, because you never know which way the tide turns. It’s unfair and wrong to choose, (unless you genuinely don’t like someone) and its unfortunate because you will henceforth always have a gun trained on your head for doing so. Choose your friends wisely, and handle their break-ups even more so.\nMy best friend at work just resigned and is about to leave the organisation very soon. I’m happy for her but I don’t know what would I do in this place without she being around. I’m really angry that she didn’t tell me that she was looking out. Please advise what should I do?\nWhy would your best friend not tell you her plans? You need to sit down with her and ask her why she kept it from you. Friends who secretly do dramatic things that will affect you adversely need to be kept in a box marked “?”. Do not let such friends get out of that box and close to you unless all question marks have been answered to your satisfaction.\nThere is this problem of my girlfriend having too many girlfriends on whom she depends for day to day advice. They are on call all the time and I feel monitored by them day in and day out. She totally relies on their decisions about all things in her life and relationships including me. They give her advice about how to behave and not all the advice seems perfect for her. I made friends with her friends and found all this amusing at first but now it is irritating me to no end. I want to tell her this but am afraid she may take it in the wrong way and I am sure she will share this with her girlfriends who will obviously want me out of her life! Tell me what to do?\nTell her you have been watching her interact with her friends and think it’s amazing how friends opinions are so crucial to life and relationships. Add that you would like to give the same level of awesome privilege to your friends… because clearly that’s how it should be done! Jokingly allude to the fact that you were all for a nuclear family, but this happy big joint family structure seems pretty enchanting too. And then just leave the ball in her court.\nI am 19 years old and off for higher studies to a school of repute abroad. I had it all planned and so did my boyfriend who has been with me for the last five years. We have shared school and college together and had applied for this too together but unfortunately he could not make it. He is happy for me but wants me to wait for him a year longer so that we go next year. However my parents who have supported me all the time are advising me to take up this opportunity. I cannot seem to come to a decision, please help.\nThere are no guarantees that he may make it the next year either. Tell him this is something you need to do for yourself, your future and your family, and that in todays era of digital communication it’s difficult but not too difficult to be apart.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:51:00.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
