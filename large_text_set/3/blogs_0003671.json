That victim told police he was not the intended target. \nChief Inspector Scott Small says surveillance video shows a car with tinted windows parked at the intersection. \n“It clearly shows four males exit the vehicle wearing masks and armed with guns,” Small said. “These four men begin firing weapons.” \nPolice are still looking for those four suspects. The motive for the shooting is unclear. \nAnyone with information should call authorities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T00:28:36.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
