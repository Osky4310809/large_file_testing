Why would she do that? Because if Dr. Alchemy can restore the powers people had in the Flashpoint timeline, it seems reasonable to believe he could remove Caitlin's powers. If you remember, Caitlin was just a pediatric ophthalmologist in the Flashpoint timeline. Thanks, Barry! \nWhen Jesse Quick (guest star Violett Beane) informs the team that her father (Tom Cavanagh) has been abducted, Barry (Grant Gustin), Caitlin (Danielle Panabaker), Cisco (Carlos Valdes) and Julian (Tom Felton) voyage to Earth-2 on a rescue mission to save Harry from Gorilla City. As they trek through the forest, Barry and the team are immediately captured and brought to Grodd (voiced by David Sobolov). \nGrodd tells them he needs their help to stop Solovar (voiced by Keith David), the leader of Gorilla City, as Solovar wants to invade Earth-1. Meanwhile, back on Earth-1, Jesse and Kid Flash (Keiynan Lonsdale) hit the streets to stop a metahuman that can control gravity, with H.R. and Joe (Jesse L. Martin) guiding them from S.T.A.R. Labs. \nDermott Downs directed the episode with story by Andrew Kresiberg and teleplay by Aaron Helbing & David Kob. --- \nHave you seen LEGO Batman yet?
