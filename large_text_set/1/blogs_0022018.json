More interestingly, the bridge was developed through the optimization and distribution of raw recycled materials to help minimize waste. On the functional side, the bridge also features powerful structural performance, as micro-reinforced concrete is only used where absolutely necessary.\nThe new footbridge is now available in Catalonia, Madrid for public usage.\nFor more amazing architecture, check out this seafront home built with rocks excavated from its surroundings .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T10:04:26.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
