He believes the Foxes players showed \"typical selfishness\" and were \"thinking about more money\" rather than the job at hand. Mourinho spoke ahead of their EFL Cup final with Southampton on Sunday, shortly after UEFA held the draw for the Europa League last 16. Per Metro 's Chris Winterburn, he is unhappy with facing the Russian side: Chris Winterburn @Chriswin4 Mourinho on Europa League draw, \"It's a bad draw in every aspect. It's far and it's difficult. It comes in a bad period for us.\" 2/24/2017, 2:01:42 PM Chris Winterburn @Chriswin4 Mourinho on Rostov, \"Very defensive and very physical team, I know their coach well from my matches against Rubin Kazan with Inter.\" 2/24/2017, 2:02:44 PM The fixtures will be played away on Thursday, March 9 and then at home on Thursday, March 16, either side of a Monday night match at Chelsea in the FA Cup. However, while the travelling is far from ideal for the Red Devils, they managed to avoid the likes of Lyon, Roma, Schalke and Borussia Monchengladbach —all of whom will face each other. As such, if United can come through the Rostov test then two of their biggest rivals for the trophy will be out before the quarter-finals. The Special One also paid tribute to Ranieri, who guided the Foxes to their incredible title win last year, per the Times ' Paul Hirst: Paul Hirst @hirstclass JM “When I was sacked as champion, it was a giant negative thing. Now I know it was peanuts in comparison. Nobody can delete what he did\" Mourinho believes the scale of the Italian's achievement last season and subsequent failure to live up to expectations this year have cost him his position at the King Power Stadium: Chris Winterburn @Chriswin4 Mourinho, \"If last season Claudio finish 12th it would be amazing, he'd still be here now. He has paid for his success.\" 2/24/2017, 2:09:40 PM Per the Mirror 's Alex Richards , he added: \" Probably the season started with the typical selfishness of others, people thinking about new contracts, people thinking about leaving, people thinking about more money, people forgetting what helped them reach a certain level.\" Looking ahead to Sunday's Wembley Stadium showpiece, Mourinho expressed his desire to win the EFL Cup ahead of the Saints, per United's official Twitter feed: Manchester United @ManUtd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:37:38.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
