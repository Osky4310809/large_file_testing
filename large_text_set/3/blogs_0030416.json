It has been claimed that the song was the first by a multi-racial band to top the charts. \nAccording to the BBC, his family confirmed he had died on Monday.

Afterwards, he started singing with the band, before going on to lead a solo career in the 1970s. Curtis also appeared in musicals in London’s West End. \nCurtis’s wife told the BBC earlier this year: “Unfortunately he has been diagnosed with two cancers. Doctors cannot do anything about it. \n“We’re spending time at home having our happy days together. It depends what his body and mind will decide to do. \n“We had the prognosis about six months ago. Doctors said he will never walk, but he’s walking now.” \nHe had left the band before it released perhaps its best known song Build Me Up Buttercup.
