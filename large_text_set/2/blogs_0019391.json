(bitch, where?)...\nYou see, silly rabbit, to be the queen of rap/\nYou gotta sell records, you gotta get plaques. \"\nvia GIPHY\nLittle background, here: Nicki Minaj has famously declared herself the Queen of Rap, on several occasions—including but not limited to her feature on Ariana Grande's \"Side to Side\" (\" I'm the queen of rap, young Ariana run pop \") and her feature on Rae Sremmurd's \"No Flex Zone - Remix\" (\" Run this game for 5 years/ guess that's why my feet hurt...Yes, I am an icon, that's me on your t-shirt \").\nAnd many considered this \"Make Love\" verse to be the clapback at Remy Ma everyone's been waiting for.\nSo: Why would Nicki Minaj be clapping back at Remy Ma, you ask?\nOn December 25, 2016—because shade does not take time off for Christmas— New York rapper Phresher released a video for his song \"Wait A Minute (Remix)\" featuring Remy Ma. And in the song Remy Ma raps,\n\"Will I smoke this bitch? Yes/\nProbably fail my piss test/\nGet rid of those fake breasts/\nAnd put a vest on this bitch chest.\"\nThe lyrics pinged the internet's collective shade barometer as a shot at Nicki Minaj and her then-boyfriend Meek Mill (who'd previously failed a urine test and was put on house arrest).\nI'm so confused.\nRemy Ma stated she doesn't like/want to be put up against Nicki.
