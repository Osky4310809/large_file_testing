In restaurants, naan is typically fired in a tandoor, which is what gives it those delightful, slightly charred air bubbles. But this recipe shows you three ways to make naan — in the oven, on a skillet, or in a pressure cooker. The results are so good, you'll think it really is from a restaurant. Restaurant-Style Garlic Naan [Vegan] 2 teaspoons dried active yeast 2 teaspoons sugar 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for coating 1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste 1 cup warm water or non-dairy milk, or as needed, for kneading 3-4 tablespoons garlic, grated To Make the Garlic Butter: Combine garlic and butter in a small bowl and mix well. Set it aside. To Make the Dough: In a small bowl, mix the yeast and sugar with 1/4 cup of warm water. Leave it in a warm place for 5-10 minutes or until the yeast is covered with froth. Mix together activated yeast mixture, the flour, salt and 1 tablespoon oil. Add a little water and knead well with your hands to make a soft and slightly sticky dough. Apply a little oil to the dough ball and cover it with a plastic wrap. Leave it in a warm place to rise for 2 hours or until it is double in size. Punch the dough and knead again. Pinch into large lemon-sized balls and dip it into dry flour. Spread garlic and coriander. You can also do this once you roll the dough ball. Repeat the same method with the rest of the dough. To Make Naan in a Skillet: Roll a dough ball into an oval shape and stretch it from all the sides to shape it into a teardrop. Don’t roll them out too thinly or they’ll turn out like crisps. Heat a pan/tawa (Indian pan for cooking flatbread) over medium-high heat. Apply water on one side of naan and place the water side down on the tawa. Cook for about 1 minute until the dough, puffs up. Once the naan start bubbling and dough start drying, flip the tawa over hot plate or flame and cook for one more minute or until they turn golden brown. Brush the cooked naan with melted garlic butter. Cover with a cloth to keep warm until serving. To Make Naan in a Pressure Cooker: Roll a dough ball into an oval shape and stretch it from all the sides to shape it into a teardrop. Don’t roll them out too thinly or they’ll turn out like crisps. Heat a pressure cooker over medium-high heat without the lid. Apply water on one side of naan and place the water side down on the tawa. Cook for about 1 minute, until the dough, puffs up. Once the naan start bubbling and dough start drying, flip the pressure cooker over a hot plate or flame and cook for one more minute or until they turn golden brown. Brush the cooked naan with melted garlic butter. Cover with a cloth to keep warm until serving. To Make Naan in the Oven: Set the oven to broil. Roll a dough ball into an oval shape and stretch it from all the sides to shape it into a teardrop. Don’t roll them out too thinly or they’ll turn out like crisps. Place rolled naan on a lined baking tray and put it in the top of the oven and broil for about 1-2 minutes. Flip it over and broil for 2 more minutes. Brush the cooked naan with melted garlic butter. Serve fresh from the oven. \nAUTHOR & RECIPE DETAILS \nIndian classics and tasty snacks made from scratch using fresh, whole ingredients and flavors.
