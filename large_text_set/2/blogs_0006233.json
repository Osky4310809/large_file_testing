I want to take that normal and toss it.” A photo posted by Tamara Ecclestone Rutland (@tamaraecclestoneofficial) on Feb 8, 2017 at 9:54am PST \nThe photographer, Ivette Ivens, also shared the photo on her Instagram account and wrote: “All about her. Thank you @tamaraecclestoneofficial for being the perfect #BreastfeedingGoddess.” \nShe also shared another shot of Ecclestone breastfeeding Sophia. A photo posted by Forest Fairy ✨ (@ivetteivens) on Feb 8, 2017 at 1:45pm PST \nCommenting on the first shot of Ecclestone and Sophia, a mother wrote: “Hopefully one day no one will bat an eyelid at a breastfeeding mum, you’re looking fab Tamara, so motherly and oozing with love and affection.” \nAnother wrote: “Everything about this picture is beautiful. If you see anything else, you need help.” \nHowever some mothers felt disheartened by the fact that Ecclestone was promoting breastfeeding when some women aren’t able to. \n“As natural as it is, it does feel a bit like a smack in the face to mothers who were not able to breastfeed, like me,” one wrote. \nAnother wrote: “Stop telling everyone it’s natural and trying to push this is right, not everyone can breastfeed for many reasons. \n“Research, please. Stop trying to tell people what’s right, as it’s not right for everyone.” Also on HuffPost", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:55:28.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
