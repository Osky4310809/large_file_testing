What is Earth Hour? \nEarth Hour is the world's largest grassroots movement for the environment, organised by WWF. \nThe event first started Sydney in 2007, in an attempt to put climate change in the spotlight. \nIt is now celebrated across all continents, and has helped bridge the gap between the grassroots and the corridors of power, taking climate action from conference rooms to living rooms. \nIn Argentina, for example, Earth Hour has helped mobilise public support for the creation of a 3.4 million hectare-wide marine protected area, while in Uganda, local communities and businesses have created the first Earth Hour forest. \n\"We started Earth Hour in 2007 to show leaders that climate change was an issue people cared about,\" said Siddarth Das, Executive Director, Earth Hour Global. \n\"For that symbolic moment to turn into the global movement it is today, is really humbling and speaks volumes about the powerful role of people in issues that affect their lives.\" When is Earth Hour? \nEarth Hour 2017 will take place on Saturday 25 March at 8:30pm local time, when millions of people in over 170 countries across the world will switch off their lights for one hour to show they care about the future of our planet. Why do people turn the lights off? \nEarth Hour is not about how much energy is saved during the hour, but about putting the spotlight on the issues facing the planet and inspiring people to live more sustainably. \nThe idea is that the choices people make and the actions they take after the hour is up can help reduce the impacts of climate change on the planet, its wildlife and future generations.

(Photo: Getty) \nThousands landmarks and monuments joined the switch off last year, including the Empire State Building, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Sydney Opera House and Shanghai's iconic skyline. \nThis year, dozens of famous UK locations have signed up to take part, including Buckingham Palace, the Gherkin, the London Eye, Big Ben, Harrods, Olympia London, the BT Tower, the OXO Tower and Canary Wharf (One Canada Square). \nThe stadiums of football teams such as Liverpool, Arsenal and Queens Park Rangers will also be plunged into darkness. \nOther notable spots taking part around the country include Brighton Pier, Windsor Castle, Durham Cathedral, the Angel of the North and Liverpool's Radio City Tower. \nA number of UNESCO World Heritage sites traditionally take part, including the Acropolis in Athens and Edinburgh Castle, and thousands of schools also do their bit by switching off.

How can you donate? \nAs skylines darken, people will be invited to take a stand for climate action on their Facebook timelines through the Donate Your Feed platform.
