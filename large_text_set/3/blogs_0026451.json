That’s also true in Portland, Oregon, where a group of self-described anarchists have reportedly patched a few potholes to call attention to the piece of shit that is the city’s roads. Here's Why America's Roads Are Total Shit Here's Why America's Roads Are Total Shit Here's Why America's Roads Are Total Shit Did you hear? U.S. roads are total shit! Our bridges are a fucking mess, too! And a new report… Read more Read more \nAccording to The Oregonian , the group’s working anonymously with the intention of fixing roads and squashing the perception that anarchists are only into, well, anarchy.

Sponsored \n“We share that frustration,” the spokesperson told the Oregonian . “We’d like to repair more potholes more quickly, but our efforts have been thwarted by Mother Nature.” \nRain or not, until everyone collectively agrees to pay more to keep our roads in tip-top shape, they’re going to continue to be a mess, so, anarchists fixing roads seems like a fine idea to me.
