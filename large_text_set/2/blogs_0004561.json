I don't just want to be a programmed voice on a computer. Also, for the kids and Liz, I want the voice not to be a computer one.\" \nHe is being helped by a Edinburgh research centre the Anne Rowling Clinic, which specialises in degenerative diseases. \nThe centre, set up by Harry Potter author JK Rowling whose mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, is running a project which is trying to create personal synthetic voices, called Speak:Unique. \nMr Liversidge's speech is already starting to slur, but scientists aim to \"repair\" the flaws in it with the aid of donors. \nThe process involves finding people with a similar accent to read 400 phrases on to a computer, which can then be banked and broken down into sounds to recreate any word. \nDr Phillipa Rewaj, who is working on the project, said: \"Rather than trying to record every single word in the dictionary, we capture all those sounds so that we can use them in any other word in which they occur. \n\"Your voice is as identifiable to other people as your face is, it is very unique to you, so being able to preserve that I think is very important to people.\" Image caption The couple, who have two daughters, Lilly and Poppy, are focusing on making memories for the future \nShe is using the video of a speech Mr Liversidge made at his sister's wedding as a benchmark, and needs 20 to 30 \"donors\", preferably from Scarborough where he grew up, to fill in the gaps. \nHis wife, Liz Liversidge, said they were trying as a family to ensure they do as much together now as possible, as she knows the condition is life-limiting. \n\"It's really important for us that we try and get out and about with the girls and make as many memories as possible,\" she said. \n\"We're trying to compile as many videos and photographs as possible, so later on when Jason is no longer here they have something to remember him by.\" \nThe \"new\" voice created by the clinic will be controlled by Mr Liversidge using eye movements, focusing on letters to type out what he wants to say. \nNearly all the voices the clinic has worked on since it opened in 2011 have been Scottish, and Mr Liversidge's is the first Yorkshire accent. \nFinding all the donors will take months but in the meantime the couple are trying to keep family life as \"normal\" as possible - Mr Liversidge is still able to drive so he can do the school run and join his family on days out. \nDespite this, Mrs Liversidge said it was the \"constant progression\" of the condition that they have found hard. \"He's not even able to pick the girls up and give them a cuddle,\" she said. \nThe personalised voice equipment should be ready to use in a matter of months, once all the donor voices have been recorded.
