Comedian Amiri King then brought the issue to the public's attention and posted this screenshot of Brad's comment:\nNow, thousands of comfort food vigilantes are making it their mission to seek justice for Brad's wife and are truly taking advantage of every opportunity to do so. And we mean every opportunity.\nImage: Screenshot From Facebook\nImage: Screenshot From facebook\nImage: screenshot from facebook\nImage: screenshot from facebook\nImage: SCREENSHOT FROM FACEBOOK\nImage: screenshot from facebook\nImage: screenshot from facebook\nImage: screenshot from facebook\nImage: screenshot from facebook\nImage: screenshot from facebook\nImage: screenshot from facebook\nNo exaggeration, pretty much every comment on Cracker Barrel's page calls for #JusticeForBradsWife.
