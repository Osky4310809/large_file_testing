Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA heartbroken husband says his wife told her children she was going to Tesco and hasn't been seen since. \nAine Poynton, 49, has now not been missing for more than 16 days. \nHusband Paul, 50, said he is desperately worried and that her disappearance is totally out of character. \nAine's car was found just around the corner from the family home in Kilcock, Co Kildare on February 23, the day after she was last seen. \nShe had told her adult children she was going to Tesco to do some shopping but she never came back. \nPaul told the Irish Mirror that his and Aine’s family are desperate to find out where is and for her to return home. \nHe said: “We just want her to know that we all love her and miss here and want her home. \n“All of us are desperately worried about her because this is not like here to not contact here or to her own family.” \nAine drove away from the family home at around 8pm on the evening of February 22 but only went a short distance before she abandoned her car. \nIt is unknown how she travelled from there but when she went missing she was wearing a black coat, black jumper and blue trousers. \nHer distraught husband said they had been together for almost 30 years and were due to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary next August. \nThe couple have two children, a son aged 22 and a 19-year old daughter. \nThe Irish police and Police Service of Northern Ireland have been involved in the search and yesterday it emerged that Aine was spotted taking a flight from Belfast to London’s Gatwick airport in the company of a mystery man. \nPaul said that Aine’s parents and her two brothers and two sisters also fear for her safety as they are very close and it is so out of character for her not to make contact for over two weeks. \nHe added: “This is so not like her, we just want her to get in contact so we’ll know that she is safe. We just don’t know where she is and that makes it all the worse. \n“We’re worried about here state of mind. \n“The place is just not the same without here and the children miss her so much. \n“Even Buster the dog is pining for her. She used to take a nap on the sofa and he’d go asleep beside her. \n“We’re missing here terrible and we’re all just hoping that she’ll ring us or better still just walked through that door.” \nAine Poynton is described as being around 5ft 3in with blonde hair and blue eyes. \nAnyone with information can contact Leixlip Garda Station on 01- 6667800, the Garda Confidential Telephone Line 1800 666 111 or any garda station.
