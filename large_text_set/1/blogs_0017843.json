In a new interview, the President-elect said Cook “loves his country” and has “his eyes open” to building production facilities at home. \nTrump has been calling for Apple and other big American companies to start manufacturing goods in the U.S. throughout his presidential campaign, and he’s held meetings with Cook since he was elected to try and persuade him to bring jobs back from China. \nDuring one conversation, Trump told Cook it would be a “big achievement” to build manufacturing plants in the U.S. — and Cook appears to have been swayed. \n“I really believe he loves this country and I think he’d like to do something major here,” Trump told Axios . \n“And I told him, I said, ‘Tim, it’s going to be a big achievement the day you start building some of your big plants in this country instead of other countries.’ And I think he’s got his eyes open to it. I think he’s got his eyes open to it.” \nIt certainly seems like Cook is more open to the idea than Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs ever was. Back in 2010, a year into his first presidential stint, Barack Obama asked Apple about manufacturing at home, and Jobs said bluntly, “Those jobs aren’t coming back.” \nTrump isn’t just pleading with Apple to bring manufacturing jobs to America, though; he’s also introducing changes that will make the move more attractive — like easing regulations and cutting taxes. \nHe could also cut repatriation taxes, allowing Apple to bring billions of dollars currently sat in banks overseas into the U.S. without having to hand over so much to the government. \nThere are plenty of reasons why manufacturing in China makes more sense for Apple, however. Not only are labor costs significantly cheaper, but there are a greater number of skilled workers, too — as Cook explained during an interview with 60 Minutes in December 2015. \n“You can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in,” Cook told Charlie Rose. “In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.” \nApple certainly won’t be manufacturing all of its products in the U.S. anytime soon, then, but Trump will be pleased Cook is at least open to the idea of building plants there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:15:57.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
