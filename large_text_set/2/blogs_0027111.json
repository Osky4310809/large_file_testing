But it has to make economic sense. \n“The problem is that, for pricing the people who are willing to invest are not encouraged by the economy.” \nHe lamented that the progress on domestic gas utilisation has been slow. The reason for this, he noted is not the lack of market. The challenges range from lack of adequate domestic gas infrastructure and gas pricing mechanism, to the extent that some companies consider it cheaper to burn associated gas, rather than to sell. \n“Most of the electric generating plants built, which are meant to be powered by gas, are unable to get gas for one reason or the other. This is not to say there is no progress made in recent times but a lot still needs to be done. Opportunities abound for using gas for home consumption, fertilizer production and powering of locomotives,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:17:51.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
