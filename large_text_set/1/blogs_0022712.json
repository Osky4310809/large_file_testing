We’ve excluded Stephen Chow’s movies because we’ve got a whole other article dedicated to him right here . \nGong Xi Fa Cai! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cEr-DON3jcI?wmode=opaque\">Embedded video</a> Fat Choi Spirit \nThis Andy Lau mahjong movie was almost an instant classic upon its release, and it's not hard to see why - mahjong is to Chinese New Year what Turkey is to Thanksgiving. There have been other mahjong movies in its wake, but none have managed to so vividly capture the imagination of audiences since. \nNothing will rev up your mahjong glands more than watching this movie. Many mahjong players actually style their gaming habits based on the advice doled out in the film - whether or not it actually improves their chances is anyone’s guess. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PYUkkAGzgec?wmode=opaque\">Embedded video</a> God of Gamblers \nThe God of Gamblers is not just the faceless deity to which all Chinese quietly beseech during their “friendly” new year card games, nor is it just the venerable Chow Yun Fat. It is the longest running gambling film franchise in all of Hong Kong cinema, and that's not even including its various spinoffs. \nAlthough it was not initially intended as a CNY film, the series (recently rebranded as “From Vegas To Macau”) eventually started to coincide with the CNY holidays and adopted a more light-hearted and celebratory tone. The most effective advertising for casinos to Chinese people ever. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ticE-Eg7I8o?wmode=opaque\">Embedded video</a> Who Am I \nChinese New Year is not just all about gambling. In his heyday, several of Jackie Chan’s action comedies were released during this period, and “Who Am I” happens to be one of the more successful ones. \nPlaying an agent who has lost his memory, Jackie Chan finds himself globetrotting in order to solve the mystery of his identity. \nThe movie is rife with incredible stunts, including one in which he almost just casually slides down the side of a very steep and very tall building - a stunt that found its way into Tom Cruise’s repertoire in Mission Impossible 3.
