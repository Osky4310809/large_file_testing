Bill Kristol, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle , appeared on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports” on Monday, and the topic turned to President Donald Trump’s tweet on Friday declaring that the media is “the enemy of the American people.” After a discussion of how accurately Thomas Jefferson’s Quote: s on the media were being cited, Kristol jumped into a frank assessment of what he thinks the tweet says about Trump’s state of mind.\n“‘Enemy of the people’ is a phrase that’s riddled with bad associations,” he explained. “Trump doesn’t know them, I assume, but still, it says something about his mindset that that he thinks he’s President of the United States, he’s not a private citizen popping off on Twitter, and he says the media are enemies of the people?” Kristol continued with the same theme, that Trump doesn’t quite understand or care about the gravity that comes with being president.\n“He has not internalized the fact — [unintelligible interjection] — he chooses not to take seriously the fact that he’s now President of the United States,” he added. “He thinks he can just do what he did as a private citizen, as a guest on talk radio, even as a candidate. I guess we’ll see, we’ll have an experiment as to whether that works. I don’t think it will, his followers thing it’s great. You look at that press conference, it’s so different from previous press conferences, but I reality is now taking hold, and there’s a reason presidents usually try to behave like presidents.”\nHave ", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Ftv%2Fkristol-trump-chooses-to-not-take-seriously-the-fact-hes-now-president%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Capture-12.jpg&description=Bill%20Kristol%3A%20Trump%20%E2%80%98Chooses%20to%20Not%20Take%20Seriously%20The%20Fact%20He%E2%80%99s%20Now%20President%E2%80%99", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Ftv%2Fkristol-trump-chooses-to-not-take-seriously-the-fact-hes-now-president%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "http://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2017-02-20T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:15:40.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
