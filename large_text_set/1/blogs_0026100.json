Hell yes, says Cassius Powell (above right), who shows you how \nWords: Abigail Radnor Moves: Cassius Powell \nThe first thing you need to know when learning to dance like Beyoncé is this: you can’t. Not really. For what a workshop dedicated to her choreography illustrates above all else is that she really is in a league of her own; there’s a reason she’s known as Queen B. \nThe second thing you need to know is that this doesn’t matter at all. An hour or two giving your all to replicating her moves has to be the most fun workout there is; whether or not your can tilt your buttocks, or jiggle at an impossibly fast pace. The key is to let go, channel your inner diva and enjoy yourself. \nThat’s exactly what I’m doing, with friends, at a Beyoncé dance workshop at a Frame gym in London. Cassius Powell, our teacher, has clearly spent many an hour analysing Beyoncé’s moves and is just the man to make you connect with your inner Bey: wildly encouraging, while keeping the cringe factor low. The warm-up involves pretending to come on stage to a cheering crowd of thousands, which sounds crazy (there are six of us in the room) but is the perfect start. We strike poses in time to the music before strutting forward and launching into the infamous Crazy In Love twerk, a (fairly) simple routine that combines controlled fierceness with downright sexiness. We are in the Bey zone. Beyoncé’s Run The World (Girls) \nCassius then leads us through the dance to Run The World (Girls) . We only cover the first quarter of the song, but it takes the best part of an hour and leaves us all panting, sweating and wondering how Beyoncé does all this while singing. In heels. Only when trying to break the dances down do you realise just how intricate they are, like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time (but a hell of a lot sexier). As we attempt a complicated body roll, Cassius explains that Beyoncé’s moves are fluid and loose, as opposed to Britney Spears , for example, who is more rigid and uniform. “That explains it,” my friend K says. “I am from the Britney school of dance.” We are so empowered/deluded that when Cassius tells us we’re one of the best groups he’s taught, we choose to believe him, though we know he is lying. \nWe quite literally get in formation for the final part of the routine, in a V-shape, and at one point, when we finally master the shoulder raises combined with a whip of the head, hands firmly planted on hips, I catch sight of us in the mirror. We look amazing: strong and fierce, an army of badass, sweaty women. This is not just a tough workout; we have found our inner Beyoncés and it feels great. In between gasping for breath, my friend S shouts, “This is better than therapy!” It may be 8pm on a Tuesday, but it’s one of the best nights out we’ve had in a while.

As Ianthe shows here, it’s more of a twerk than a thrust, and it takes work. Here’s how to do it. 1 Stand side on with your arms bent, hands above your head. Practise swinging your hips backwards and upwards. Think of it as though you are trying to get your booty to hit the ceiling. 2 Rotate your hips forward. 3 and 4 Repeat several times. Think twerk rather than thrust. 5 Bring your arms in front of your pelvis and cross your wrists, fists clenched. 6 Uncross them and punch them down to your sides like you mean business. Do not forget to slay. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T11:44:20.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
