Philstar.com/File MANILA, Philippines â€” Mocha Uson's appointment to a government post is within President Rodrigo Duterte's discretion and is a sign of his trust in her, a Palace spokesman said Tuesday. \"I believe she is qualified and the president has trust and confidence in her,\" Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in an interview on ANC. Uson, member and singer of the all-female group Mocha Girls and starred in several movies before becoming an active blogger and vocal supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte was appointed as Movie and Television Review and Classification Board member last December 28. On Monday, she was inducted into office together with more than 200 newly-appointed government officials. Andanar cited Uson's long show business career and her having a college degree as possible qualifications for being picked for the board that screens, classifies and censors TV shows and movies. Uson starred in horror-thriller Sumpa and in a Filipino-Malaysian film both released in 2011, and starred in Mga Alaala ng Tag-ulan in 2013. She also made a cameo appearance in romantic comedy Four Sisters and a Wedding in 2013. Andanar, however, admitted to not knowing who recommended Uson to the post. \"We give all the leeway to the president when choosing his appointees. Mocha is no exception,\" Andanar said, adding Uson continues to be an ally of the president.
