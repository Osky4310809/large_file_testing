Visitors to the nature center can be seen capturing the unusual spectacle.\n“I love Circle B. Nature at its best,” Joiner wrote on the post, which has been shared more than 18,000 times.\nSome Facebook commenters say that the well-known gator is nicknamed “Humpback” on account of his large, curved back, FOX 13 reports .\nThis is not the first big gator to hit the headlines in Florida recently. Last year a hunter in the Sunshine State nabbed a 13-and-half-foot alligator. The state record for length was a 14 foot 3 1/2 inch male at Lake Washington in Brevard County, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission . Florida’s heaviest recorded gator was a 1,043 pound (13 feet 10-1/2 inches long) male at Orange Lake in Alachua County.\nLast year a humongous gator became something of a media sensation when it was spotted wandering around the Buffalo Creek Golf Course in Palmetto on Florida’s Gulf coast.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T11:23:13.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
