However, the difference between his “vacations” and those taken by Barack Obama are vast. \nObama spent nearly $100 million in eight years traveling to Hawaii and other destinations. \nTrump is merely going to his resort in Florida to conduct business. \nYou see, Trump recently entertained Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago. \nWhat 45 did to the media has them enraged… \nFrom IJ Review : \nOn Saturday, President Trump went out for a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Media bias rules dictate that when the occupant of the Oval Office is a Republican, it’s alright to complain about him golfing. \nNaturally, the press corps tagged along with the president and prime minister, but when it came time to hit the links, Trump wanted some privacy…so he banished the media to the basement: Trump's press corps has been placed in a basement suite at Jupiter golf club. Black plastic over windows to give Trump privacy as he golfs. pic.twitter.com/8zbqi5HGSD \n— Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) February 11, 2017 \nReactions… @JenniferJJacobs The press corps puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the suite again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:14:55.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
