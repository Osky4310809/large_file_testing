It doesn’t matter if you miss 10, you’re doing something right because you’re in that positions. \n“The worst things I’ve seen with strikers is they’ll do it twice (miss) and they won’t get in that position again, they shy away from that. Ian Rush believes Sturridge's luck will change if he keeps getting in good positions (Photo: Omnisport) \n“Keep getting in those positions and your luck will change – on another day Daniel would have scored. You can’t criticise him for missing because he’s done something right to get in the right position and if he keeps doing that the time will come when he gets three chances, scores three goals and everyone will forget about this. \n“It’s about being positive and having that mental toughness.” \nRush was at Anfield to witness Liverpool’s failure to take that final step to Wembley in a competition he himself won five times with the Reds. \nHe believes it’s now up to the players to react to that disappointment.

Semi-finals are a nightmare you know. But they’ve had two chances at it. It’s disappointing but it’s how you react to it, it’s going to be an interesting few weeks. \n“A few weeks ago and everyone was happy – we’re going to finish in the top four, we’re going to win a trophy. \n“Three weeks down the line, we’re not in the trophy we had the best chance of winning any more, we lost to Swansea, but it’s all about how you react. \n“Everything’s great when you’re winning, it’s when you’re not it matters. The fans played their part in fairness on Wednesday night and got behind the team, it’s up to the players to react.” Jamie Carragher said Sturridge has lost his pace due to constant injuries (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nOne bright spot in the week for Liverpool fans was the new contract signed by Philippe Coutinho, keeping him at Anfield for another five years. \nRush believes the 24-year-old Brazilian will only get better over the next few years. \n“He’s young and he’s still improving. He’s adapted really well to English football. With the skill he’s got you wonder whether he’s better suited to a warmer weather climate, Spain or Italy, but he’s adapted to the faster pace of the English game and I think he’ll get better.” poll loading Will Daniel Sturridge still be at Liverpool last season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T13:13:30.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
