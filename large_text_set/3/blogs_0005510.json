LISTEN ON RADIOPUBLIC “We listened to the ambassador, to what his concerns might be,” Mr. Sessions continued in his news conference on Thursday. “It was just normal things. I don’t remember a lot of it.” But the purpose of that meeting between Sessions, who was then a senator from Alabama, and Mr. Kislyak is now the subject of intense scrutiny since the meeting was revealed this week. On today’s episode: • Mr. Sessions has recused himself from any investigations into Russia’s interference in the presidential campaign. What was he doing meeting with the Russian ambassador two months before Election Day? Matthew Rosenberg, a national security reporter, joins us to to make sense of what we know and when we knew it. \nAdvertisement • Who is this mysterious Russian ambassador who has caused so much trouble for two senior officials in the Trump White House? For that we talk to Peter Baker, our chief White House correspondent. Background reading: • More on Mr. Sessions’s recusal from investigations into Russian’s role in Mr. Trump’s election. • More on Mr. Kislyak’s powerful network in the United States.
