Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nF1 star Jenson Button is supporting an old school friend who lost three limbs following an horrific work electrocution. \nJamie Mines, 33, recently became a dad of two but missed much of his twin baby girls' first few months in an induced coma. \nNow Jenson, 37, has offered his support by auctioning off one of his race helmets \"for Jamie Mines, a school buddy who has been severely injured at work.\" \nAnd Somerset Live believes he may even make an appearance in the town of Frome this Sunday to support a fun day organised to raise funds for Jamie's family. Read More (Photo: Copyright Unknown) (Photo: Copyright Unknown) \nIn a series of tweets by the sportsman, Jenson said: \"Jamie's friends have currently raised a substantial sum of money but still more is needed to support Jamie & family at this difficult time. \n\"So please get bidding on my race worn helmet from the 2007 Turkish GP.\" \nJamie was electrocuted while working at height on scaffolding on Tuesday, December 10 at Kendrick Industrial Estate on Galton Way in Swindon. \nHis injuries were so serious he had to be placed into an induced coma. \nOriginally one leg and a hand were amputated – but several days later, soon after Boxing Day, both his arms had to be amputated too. (Photo: Copyright Unknown) \nSince then his friends, Frome, and the nation have come together to raise money for the father-of-two who is currently recovering at Oxford Hospital having previously spent time at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. \nA Go Fund Me page set up for the ex-Frome Town FC footballer has so far raised £112,981 and Sunday's fun day looks set to boost the total significantly. Read More \nJenson Button's helmet currently stands at £4,800 and the bidding will continue at the fun day itself. (Photo: Internet Unknown) \nJenson, who grew up in Frome, last made a public appearance in the town when he came to switch on the Christmas lights in 2013. \nThe centre of town was closed off while he drove his F1 car around Market Place. (Photo: Internet Unknown) \nSunday's event promises to both a celebration of the campaign's success. The day will see 12 teams, all of which Jamie used to play for, competing for the Mines Cup. \nAside from the football there will also be face painting, balloon modelling and popcorn. There will also be cake stalls and a magician. \nOne particular highlight will be a manager's booth where people can record a video message to send to Jamie. He'll be able to watch these after the event.
