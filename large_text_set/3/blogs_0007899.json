The EPA then let nature clean up the river and got off with barely a warning when the Obama Justice Department decided not to prosecute the EPA worker responsible for turning the river orange. \nWhy is Mangold singling out the EPA for support? Because “Deepwater Horizon” actor J.D. Evermore passed along an unattributed horror story from inside the EPA. Goodbye, EPA. Please RT. pic.twitter.com/3ZkcDJnwsO \n— J.D. Evermore (@jd_evermore) March 6, 2017 \nThe website is being reworked to reflect the new administration’s policy? That sounds like standard operating procedure when a new administration takes over, but apparently is has thousands joining in a panic over the EPA’s future. \nEvermore was less than gentle with those who wanted to know more, such as the source of the information. \n— Kyle Cranmer (@KyleCranmer) March 6, 2017 @KyleCranmer It's from someone who still works within the department but doesn't want to be named, understandably. \n— J.D. Evermore (@jd_evermore) March 6, 2017 @jd_evermore yes, understandable. But don't really want to propagate \n— Kyle Cranmer (@KyleCranmer) March 7, 2017 @jd_evermore @KyleCranmer so either illegal leak or lying \n— Shawn Hamlton (@ShawnGenesco3) March 7, 2017 @ShawnGenesco3 @KyleCranmer So, either you're a dumbass or you have shit for brains. \n— J.D. Evermore (@jd_evermore) March 7, 2017 @jd_evermore @KyleCranmer why? Unnamed source. We don't know if it's true if can't be verified. The text clearly says on lockdown, so (1of2) \n— Shawn Hamlton (@ShawnGenesco3) March 7, 2017 @ShawnGenesco3 @KyleCranmer Are u aware of how many people have already lost their jobs in government for speaking out against this potus? \n— J.D. Evermore (@jd_evermore) March 7, 2017 Trending 'What a great interview': Tucker Carlson finds supporter of free speech in Middlebury professor \nNot really, no. Who tracks those statistics? @ShawnGenesco3 @KyleCranmer Sometimes rules need to be violated, otherwise I would be drinking from a whites only water fountain right now. \n— J.D. Evermore (@jd_evermore) March 7, 2017 \nWhoa, give some warning when those leaps are coming. @KyleCranmer So, some in GOP pushing bill 2dismantle EPA & new head of EPA has wanted to destroy it for years, but u find this implausible? \n— J.D. Evermore (@jd_evermore) March 7, 2017 \nWhatever you do, don’t celebrate the end of the EPA as we know it. If the EPA can be stealthily shut down, i.e. no one notices or cares when it's gone, why should we waste money on it? Right. We shouldn't. https://t.co/3GqypluWKd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:08:47.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
