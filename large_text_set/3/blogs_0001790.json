Baker is the first high-ranking employee to leave the embattled company since it began its own investigation into allegations of sexism and harassment within Uber's ranks.\nThere's no public evidence that Baker's resignation is directly tied to the investigation, but Recode reported that an employee of Uber anonymously notified Arianna Huffington—who's helping oversee the investigation—of Baker's actions.\nUber's been reeling since former employee Susan Fowler Rigetti published a blog post detailing her experiences working as an engineer at the ride-hailing giant. Since then, other employees have come forward with similar allegations.\nUber CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick said that the company is mounting a full investigation into the issue.\nDaniel Graf is taking over Baker's position, according to an Uber spokesperson who confirmed the move. Graf formerly worked at Twitter, though it was widely reported that he was pushed out of the company.\nThis is bigger than when Amit Singhal stepped down Monday. Ed was highly influential at Uber. https://t.co/gvPKSV9StB\n— Amir Efrati (@amir) March 3, 2017\nBONUS: Our picks for the top 10 best film performances in cinema history", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/FBsQLuxe.m3u8", "https://www.recode.net/2017/3/3/14805384/uber-ed-baker-resigns-travis-kalanick", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/FBsQLuxe.jpg", "https://t.co/gvPKSV9StB", "https://twitter.com/amir/status/837788842509791233"], "published": "2017-03-04T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:55:04.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
