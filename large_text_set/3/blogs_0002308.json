Cedric Richmond spoke yesterday at the Washington Press Club Foundation dinner. His attempt at a comedy routine wound up being an example of what not to do. Few of his remarks were funny but he really face-planted when he brought up Kellyanne Conway “and the picture on the sofa.”\n“I really just want to know what was going on there,” Richmond said to Sen. Tim Scott. He continued, “You know I won’t tell anybody and you can just explain to me that circumstance because she really looked kind of familiar in that position.”\nRichmond was referring to Couchgate . That’s the outrageous outrage progressives briefly occupied themselves with between flare-ups of Russia fever. Here’s the picture he was referencing:\n\nIt’s clear this was intended to be part of a comedy routine. But as Dirty Harry once said , “A man’s got to know his limitations” and Rep. Richmond is way beyond his limitations trying to do a stand-up routine. He could have resolved that very easily with a heartfelt apology to Conway. Instead, he made up an explanation that doesn’t pass the smell test. From the Washington Post :\nOn Thursday, Richmond insisted that there was no such intention behind his remarks. “Since some people have interpreted my joke to mean something that it didn’t I think it is important to clarify what I meant, ” he said in a statement. “Where I grew up saying that someone is looking or acting ‘familiar’ simply means that they are behaving too comfortably.”\nThe technical term for that explanation is “bulls**t.”\nLet’s face it, if a Republican congressman had cracked this “joke” about the most powerful Democratic woman in Washington, it would have launched 1,000 feminist memes. Few would have cared it was supposed to be funny, only that a GOP male had turned an accomplished woman into a sex object. If that same GOP representative had then offered a lame excuse instead of an apology the left would be off to the races.\nPut another way, if this incident isn’t grounds for a lecture on intersectionality and the glass ceiling then please spare me the next time some GOP backbencher says something equally dumb. The moral posturing from the feminist left really doesn’t deserve much attention until it stops being so selective with its outrage.\nFor her part, Conway told the Daily Caller , “I notice he did not apologize, he tried to clarify.” She also agreed the gaffe would get more attention if she were liberal and “pro-abortion.”\nHere’s the Rep. Richmond’s routine and your final warning that this is a comedy train wreck:\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:28:02.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
