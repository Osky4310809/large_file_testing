She's since made her account private, but people have reposted it anywayâ€”accompanied, of course, by their opinions.\nSEE ALSO: Happy Valentine's Day from these adorably terrible heart-shaped pizzas\nPizza + Milk = a great combinationðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ pic.twitter.com/G9LGvTatjF\nâ€” zack (@IsaiahDaGawdd) March 3, 2017\nOkay. Here are some reasons why this is the worst:\nPizza is not cookies.\nPizza, because it already has sauce, does not need to be wetter. Liquid-wise, it can be improved only by another savory sauce (buffalo, ranch, garlic sauce, etc.).\nNow you have to drink milk with bits of pizza in it â€” cheesy tomato milk.\n:/\nAnd fellow pizza crimes don't really hold a candle. Well, what about pineapple pizza? you might ask. And that pizza made with peas and mayonnaise ? Well, one's a matter of taste, and the other's just disgusting, to be sureâ€”a pizza troll, if you will, if it can be called a pizza at all.\nBut this? This is something else entirely .\nI read somewhere that people are WILLINGLY dipping their pizza in milk and I will not sit here quietly while such atrocities are going on\nâ€” ramÃ³n (@RGKMC_) March 4, 2017\ngood morning everyone except the person who dipped their pizza in milk\nâ€” todd coward (@gothbaseball) March 4, 2017\nIf we're on a date and you dip your pizza in milk I'm getting up from the table and walking away. I don't need to be around that energy.\nâ€” Elijah (@ lijah) March 3, 2017\nApparently pizza dipped in milk is a thing and I'd just like to announce this country needs to get its shit together...\nâ€” Cougar Bait (@CougarOnAir) March 3, 2017\nPineapple on pizza is heaven. Don't fight me on this. But today I've seen pizza dipped in milk.. and topped with bananas. I'm done\nâ€” Kachine Chingwa (@KachineChingwa) March 4, 2017\nSo, please: Don't dip your pizza in milk. Save yourself, because there's a worst case scenario here: trying milk pizza could ruin the taste of pizza for you forever.\nJust, like, have a nice soda with your pizza instead. And don't even think about dipping.\nSeriously.\nDon't.\nBONUS: This hair dye changes color based on your environment", "external_links": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/ikrd/calcium-is-good-for-u?utm_term=.jijXnqgZv#.ahQ369R2O", "https://twitter.com/CougarOnAir/status/837790466548494336", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/WMR4lHhB.m3u8", "https://t.co/G9LGvTatjF", "https://twitter.com/EEEEEElijah/status/837776122137870336", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/WMR4lHhB.jpg", "https://twitter.com/IsaiahDaGawdd/status/837533158190940161", "https://twitter.com/RGKMC_/status/838149584635498498", "https://twitter.com/KachineChingwa/status/837916670903652352", "https://twitter.com/gothbaseball/status/838058723616698368"], "published": "2017-03-05T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:21:40.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
