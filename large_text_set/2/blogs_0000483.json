I’ve made friends, organized a feminist conference, and I’m pretty sure I got a book deal all thanks to my Twitter feed. I also use my platform to post occasional food pics; I do, after all, own a bunch of restaurants in Canada. But I most enjoy using Twitter to call out sexism in the food industry . Why is nothing ever ugly enough to galvanize the men who control this business? I go after obvious misogynists on Twitter for two reasons. First, I think it’s the right thing to do. The restaurant industry is still a safe space for misogyny. Almost 70 percent of female restaurant workers and 50 percent of male employees say they’ve “ experienced some form of sexual harassment ” from managers. And a ridiculous 90 percent of women in the industry have reportedly experienced some form of sexual harassment from customers . Those numbers are way too high. And secondly, if not me, who? The culture in the restaurant business is so deeply entrenched with sexism and so hidden from public view — behind the performance of being obsequiously nice to customers — that when a company makes themselves a lightning rod, it’s irresistible to me. I’ll find myself, fingers cramped from furiously typing on my phone, exhausted from keeping up with my mentions, wondering where all my peers are. There are always one or two chefs or owners who’ll pipe up in support, but an alarming majority keep silent . Where are they? Why is nothing ever ugly enough to galvanize the men who control this business? Every time news breaks of another horrific, sexist episode in a restaurant, I feel hopeful that this will be the thing that breaks the dam. When Kate Burnham came forward in June 2015 alleging the horrors of working in the kitchen at Weslodge (a popular restaurant in Toronto that, naturally, remains open) it seemed like a watershed moment, one that would bring the industry together in a real conversation about sexism. (The case has since been settled for an undisclosed amount.) Burnham’s complaints were particularly stomach-churning: For 13 months, she said she endured (among many other things) being humped from behind, being called an “angry dyke,” having her breasts grabbed, and having her face sprayed with pressurized hollandaise sauce, an act whose awfulness, I assume, is self-evident. The restaurant industry is shot through with this casual misogyny like veins in a particularly stinky blue cheese; it's systemic, pervasive, and also very, very traditional. It’s only reinforced by how hyper-male it is at the top levels. (Men, we need your help, and this is on you, too.) So I was, of course, unsurprised when I found myself unsupported by my Toronto peers as I sent out wave after wave of appalled tweets based on how gross the accusations were. The restaurant industry is shot through with casual misogyny. Despite the lack of local support, I still managed to put on a successful conference as a direct response to the Weslodge case and as an exclamation point to the conversation I wished to tear open. I called it Kitchen Bitches: Smashing the Patriarchy One Plate at a Time, and filled up the roster with a slew of big-time restaurant people, including Eater’s own Helen Rosner. Within the first five minutes, as a few women told stories of abuse and harassment on stage to a crowd of 300, names got named . Seeing women emboldened by eruptions of supportive cheers as men were called out publicly almost brought tears to my eyes. It was a lit, disorganized, beautiful mess, and I hoped the conversation would continue in a way that led to a change in tone, that led to a slowdown of white male chefs looking me in the eye and saying profoundly ignorant things like “I dunno, I’ve never really noticed sexism in restaurants.” But in the year since I smashed a plate on stage in a room that felt electrified with optimism, I have not noticed any increase in awareness from chefs and owners. And when I take to Twitter to shine a light on the kind of bullshit that makes people feel bad (which is not infrequently), I assume the deafening silence is a divided silence . Some are quiet out of fear for possibly ostracizing themselves. Some stay quiet for uglier reasons; they actually thought a sexist joke was funny or the harassment \"not that big a deal,\" but are just clever enough to not say that publicly. And some just want to keep out of “politics” as it’s no doubt bad for business — as though the right to exist without enduring blatant sexism is “politics.\" (I am very fortunate that my small restaurants can manage to remain full with the few people I haven’t offended yet.) But here’s what happens when an industry bands together to actually take a stand. Recently, a Toronto taco restaurant was revealed to have referred to female staff as #tacHOES, and asked in a particularly tone-deaf social media post: “What if Donald said ‘Grab her by the taco?’\" This is just an objectively unfunny joke — my tolerance for crude greatly decreases in an absence of funny, and who even calls pussies “tacos”? Are you 12? I went in. Hard. On Twitter, where no one edits me. In a pretty amazing turn, the public swayed firmly against the restaurant, thanks to Taylor Clarke, who runs an Instagram account whose primary function is to poke fun at Toronto’s restaurant scene and who first pointed out the offensive post. Mostly, people responded that they were appalled (though notably, few of them were restaurant people). It snowballed quickly , garnering some very bad publicity . Immediately, the restaurant issued an apology with a misguided attempt to lure customers back by donating a percentage of sales to charity (which read as self-serving). A few days later, in another PR-driven apology, the restaurant stated it would be making a $20,000 CAD donation to three women’s organizations. Ya, sure most people will just laugh along or say nothing, even your gfs might stay mum. THIS IS LITERALLY THE PROBLEM IN OUR SEXIST CULTURE — Jen Agg (@TheBlackHoof) October 11, 2016 Every town has one of these bro-centric restaurants, the places that make everyday misogyny seem like a gentle caress, albeit an unwanted one. The places that lower the bar for what is considered acceptable behavior in the industry, absolutely halting progress by making it too easy for other operators to skip improving on the basis that \"we might be bad, but hell, we aren't as bad as them.\" Unless we — both as consumers and peers — speak up, these restaurants will continue to believe that the small ripples of disapproval that float their way are the minority opinion, an easy beach to settle on in an industry that so often applauds the kind of culture that seems crafted by the awkward, incomplete worldview of a teenage boy. I’m sure there are a whole pile of people out there who find #tacHOES a genuinely hilarious hashtag, just in fun. Here’s why this is not hilarious and fun: Women have to work there and put up with this shit. I find it hard to believe many women think a reference to being “grabbed by the pussy” is funny (or maybe they are Cool Girls ). But really, what can you possibly say as an employee who is uncomfortable with the jokes made by your boss or by the culture at your workplace, a place which prides itself on a loose permissiveness — that somehow isn’t loose enough to have any room for party poopers? I can only imagine the pressure to just laugh along and smile for a photo when you’re being referred to as a “ho.” Maybe you don’t get the plum weekend shifts if you even suggest your discomfort. Maybe you don’t get any shifts at all. And what if you see your female managers participating in the ribaldry with equal or greater enthusiasm? How confusing: Maybe it is you. Maybe you can’t take a joke. Because how are we supposed to tell the difference between overflowing cups of crass kitchen humor (a specific brand from which I occasionally sip) and jokes that demean? Is there a difference? I’d like to think so. You can talk crudely to help pass the time without actually making anyone feel bad about who they are. Enough is enough. For patrons, it’s easy: stop giving money to restaurants whose public-facing messaging doesn’t match your own values. Owners, as part of the restaurant-industrial complex, you can lead your companies with fair-minded hiring practices and a zero-tolerance approach to abuse and harassment at any level in your organization. (Every once in awhile, I’ll hear about a chef wanting to make a better restaurant business “for his little girl,” but wouldn’t it be great if you didn’t actually have to produce a daughter to empathize with daughters?) And as employees, whenever possible, do not stay silent. Silence is an abuser’s best friend . Simply put, we all need to work together to make the industry better. We all need to work together to make the industry better. But I can't do it alone . As much as I’m unable to ignore a particular kind of bullshit, I get tired of being That Girl. That “there goes Jen on a Twitter rant again” girl. But you can help: Don’t make me the town crier. If you see something gross, call that shit out! Name and shame. Not sure if something is gross? Say so. 100 percent sure something is off? Yell it from the rooftops of your social feeds. I can’t help it. I’ve been drawing my metaphorical sword and calling out the bad apples since long before I amassed a decently large Twitter following. I will not shut up. Neither should you.
