In a conversation with CNBC TV 18, Walker said, “Consumer confidence is slightly concerning. Central bankers and policy makers are focusing too much on consumer prices. They will be forced to tighten the policy if consumer prices pick up”. “Exports growth to be a drag if dollar remains strong. There is plenty of support for a weak dollar,” he added. Speaking about commodities he said, “We don’t expect much more of an upside surprise from commodity prices. We had taken off short on commodities in 2016. Stabilisation in commodity prices wasn’t a surprise,” he told the business news channel. \nMeanwhile, Asian stocks held ground on Tuesday though Chinese equities surged to a fresh 2-1/2 month high as domestic funds piled into financial counters on expectations the world’s second biggest economy may have turned a corner.
