The man, who is moving closer to the 50 mark is probably fitter than the average 25 year old, which says a lot about his dedication towards fitness. He has always been an advocate of martial arts and has gotten his son into it as well. Akshay often shares news of his son winning a championship and it makes us think ‘like father, like son!’ \nTurns out, Aarav isn’t the only one who is a martial arts champ… Young Nitara is also a champ in the making. Akshay took to Instagram to post this uber cute video of her. A post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on Feb 14, 2017 at 5:11am PST \nStart ’em young, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:51:08.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
