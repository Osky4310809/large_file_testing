Now, a new report coming in from Digitimes shows potentially how Samsung will be taking steps to prevent battery overheating issues in their upcoming flagships devices. \nAs per the report, Samsung and LG will incorporate heat pipes in their flagship devices to prevent battery overheating. In case you are not aware, heat pipes are used to absorb heat generated by the SoC so that it doesn’t expose heat to other components, namely the battery. Heat pipes are not entirely a new thing for smartphones, as we have seen them in the Xperia Z5 Premium and the Galaxy S7 before. \nAccording to the report, the Galaxy S8 will use heat pipes supplied by Taiwanese manufacturers Auras Technology and Chaun Choung Technology (CCI). Meanwhile, LG will source their heat pipes from Japan-based Furukawa Electric and Taiwan-based Delta Electronics. \nThe report is in line with the recent announcement made by LG about how the G6 will incorporate copper-based heat pipes to prevent overheating. It was previously rumored that the Galaxy S8 will make use of two heat pipes for increased heat absorption. But as per the report, the Galaxy S8 will incorporate the same single heat pipe setup as the Galaxy S7 once did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T21:19:06.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
