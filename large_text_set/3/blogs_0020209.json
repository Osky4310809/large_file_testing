It’s a nearly-complete onboard electronics ban . \nA State Department officials says embassy officials have been notifying relevant countries and airlines. \nAn aviation official said U.S. carriers are not impacted because none flies directly from the countries in question to the U.S. \nThe rule will require “laptops, tablets, DVD players and electronic games must be stored in checked baggage for its flights.” \nThis puts lithium ion batteries in the baggage hold , which is generally considered dangerous because these batteries can catch fire (rarely, but with enough laptops and passengers across enough flights can happen). \nWord first came out from Royal Jordanian on Twitter. Apparently the rule was issued to go into effect in 96 hours although it’s up to potentially 13 airlines from the Mideast and Africa to notify their passengers and the Department of Homeland Security is simply issuing ‘no comment’ in response to inquiries. \nIt’s not clear which airlines are covered so far or how long this will last. One imagines that the list of covered countries could include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Egypt, Morocco, Cape Verde and Qatar. It might include Turkey. \nAssuming the statement that US airlines aren’t covered because they do not fly to the affected countries, the ban would not apply to Israel, Ghana, or Senegal. However, we’ll know soon enough. \nIf the administration isn’t permitted to implement a ban on travel from certain countries in the region, perhaps they’re going to try to make travel so miserable for anyone coming from a Muslim country that people won’t bother?
