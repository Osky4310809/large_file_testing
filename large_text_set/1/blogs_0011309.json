All art/words credited in images to Ryan North, Erica Henderson, Rico Renzi, and Travis Lanham unless otherwise stated. \nThis month marks 25 years since Doreen Green entered the world of Marvel Comics as Squirrel Girl, although her true road to becoming one of the greatest Marvel heroes around didn’t really begin until her excellent series Unbeatable Squirrel Girl kicked off in 2014. To celebrate her 25th anniversary, here are 25 of the best moments from this most fabulous of comic books. 25) 10-Year-Old Doreen’s Artwork Being Eerily Steve Ditko-Esque Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #16. Guest art by Steve Ditko. \nThis, from this week’s 25th Anniversary special issue, is amazing, because it’s literally Steve Ditko art from her first ever story in Marvel Super-Heroes Vol. 2 #8 . 24) Getting Her Own Theme Song Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #1 \nSpider-Man has a theme song. Iron Man has a theme song. Captain America has a theme song. Why not Squirrel Girl? (It’s set to the theme song for the 1960s Spider-Man cartoon , if you want to sing along!) 23) Every Super Villain Trading Card Doreen Owns Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #9 \nThese Deadpool-branded trading cards are Doreen’s key guide to all of her opponents. They’re also consistently hilarious. 22) The Perfect Debate About Superhero Costume Upgrades \nPro-tip: Superhero costumes made out of normal fabric are totally fine and unlikely to come to life/turn you evil. 21) The Visual Pun “Kraven’s Last Bundt” Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #8 \n“House of Mmm” is also excellent. 20) Squirrel Armor, Literally \nIt’s literally made out of Squirrels! 19) Doctor Doom’s Life, Saved By Cosplay Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #3 \nHas the Punisher ever actually looked so happy before? 18) Her Entire Super Crew Squirrel Girl Beats Up the Marvel Universe \nKoi Boi, Chipmunk Hunk, and of course, Doreen’s BFF Nancy Whitehead are all great. But introducing them to other superheroes tends to get a bit ... complicated. 17) Getting Nancy to Shout at a Monkey Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #6 \nAccomplished while Doreen was trying to figure out if Nancy actually has any animal-based powers. 16) Discussing Linguistics With Galactus Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #4 \nSidenote: This is also the best version of Galactus in a comic book, hands down. 15) An Earnest Desire to Fight Dinosaurs Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #5 \nAnd many other things, but dinosaurs especially. 14) The Fact She Actually Listens to Supervillains First Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #9 \nAside from being unbeatable, Squirrel Girl’s actual superpower is her ability to actually settle many conflicts by just actually talking to her potential opponents (and then kicking their butts if things go awry). 13) This Cover \nSometimes, a comic book cover is indeed too good . 12) Or Maybe This Cover Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #1 \nThanks to Secret Wars , USG managed to get not one, but two #1 issues out in the same year. This is the perfect celebration. 11) No Wait, This Cover Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #4 \nThe fighting game mash-up we need. 10) Actually, All the Covers Covers for Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #3, #13, and #8. \nThe covers for this book are consistently excellent. Check them all out here and here . 9) The Fact an Entire Issue Was Done as a Choose Your Own Adventure Comic Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #7 \nUnbeatable Squirrel Girl #7 is the first issue of Squirrel Girl with replayability ! 8) Bonding With Galactus Over... Thanos? Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #4 \nLike I said, best version of Galactus in a comic book, hands down . 7) Date Night With Sentinel #X-42903-22 Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #8 \nPoor Sentinel #X-42903-22. 6) Teaching Count Nefaria (and Basically All of Us) How to Count in Binary on Our Hands Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #11. Guest Art by Jacob Chabot. \nWhich directly led to the most metal moment in comics last year . 5) The Time She Beat Up The Avengers For Mocking Her Friends Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #7 4) Becoming the Iron Squirrel Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #2 3) Cat Thor, Loki’s Finest Illusion Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #8 \nWhen Loki offers to transform himself to show off to Nancy, this is the result, and let me tell you Thor hates it so much. Also, it’s pretty obvious that Nancy has been thinking about Cat Thor for quite some time before having this opportunity. 2) Selfies on the Moon Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #8 \nBecause what else do you do after beating up Galactus and saving the world? 1) This Amazing Throwback to Her First Story Where She Defeated Doctor Doom by Overwhelming Him With Squirrels Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #5", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:00:13.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
