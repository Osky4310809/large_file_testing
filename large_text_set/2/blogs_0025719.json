Until recently, Marvel’s mutants were the core of its superhero world, which lead them to create tons and tons of non-X-Men teams. And, so, let’s look back at some of the great none X-Men teams Marvel has put together. New Mutants \n(source) \nThe New Mutants started off as a generic team until Bill Sienkiewicz took over the art. Then, the comic became an intense and terrifying exploration of fear. Additionally, this is the book that later introduced both Cable and Deadpool under writer Fabian Niezca and artist Rob Liefeld. Excalibur \nChris Claremont’s \"British X-Men\" series gave us classic characters such as Mojo, the blob-like TV executive, and the X-Babies, who are, well, exactly what they sound like. Exiles \nThe Exiles were a team of mutants from alternate realities teaming together. It was an amazing idea, which unfortunately ended suddenly when Marvel cut back on X-Men titles. X-Factor \nThe X-Factor was Peter David’s series to just mess around with, so during his run, he made the team a traditional superhero group, a detective’s agency, and, somehow, a corporation. X-Statix \nDrawn by Mike Allred and written by Peter Milligan, X-Statix was a superhero reality show, with the behind-the-scenes drama often turning tragic and deadly due to the nature of the team's superpowers. Uncanny Avengers \n(source) \nThe most mainstream of the titles on the list, Uncanny Avengers teamed up mutants and superheroes, and it was often real awkward. The beginning of the book was noted for both its high stakes, tightly-plotted adventures and its incredibly ham-fisted discussion of the mutant metaphor. The book is currently soaring under writer Gerry Duggan. Uncanny X-Force \n(source) \nX-Force started off as a hyper-violent comic about mutants who commit black ops murder (created by Rob Liefeld), but under writer Rick Remender, it evolved into a very smart exploration of violence. \nWhich mutant team is your favorite?
