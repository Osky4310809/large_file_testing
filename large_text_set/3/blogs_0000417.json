Jurgen Klopp believes that every player at the club, including himself are playing for their future at Liverpool. The FC crew debate on why Jurgen Klopp hasn't received the criticism that is perhaps due given Liverpool's season so far. \nFormer Liverpool striker Djibril Cisse has told The Daily Mirror he believes manager Jurgen Klopp can win the Premier League title within two seasons. \nCisse, 35, made 79 appearances for the club following a move from Auxerre in the summer of 2004. \nKlopp has yet to win a trophy as Liverpool boss, but Cisse said he believed success was on its way. \n\"They missed the title when they were really close [in 2013-14] -- but that's the only thing that's missing,\" Cisse said. \n\"The Champions League is there, the FA Cup, the national cups. The title is the big thing now for Liverpool, but I think they can get it. Two or three years they will get there. \n\"Liverpool is one of the top clubs. They have some great players and it's also all about recruiting the right players. \n\"The club is there, the stadium is beautiful, the fans are amazing, the coach is the best. It's only finding the right players then go and win it.\" \nThe Frenchman praised Klopp, saying: \"He fits with the club. I give him two seasons to have the title. \n\"He gives you good energy. It's really great for a player to be under his management. He's like [Jose] Mourinho, he gives that energy. I think he'll do really well. Djibril Cisse believes Jurgen Klopp is the man to end Liverpool's title drought. \n\"In Dortmund people loved him, in Liverpool the same. It's not an accident. When everyone thinks the same about you it means there's something there.\" \nCisse, who recently retired from professional football , is now a professional DJ and has his own clothing range. \nHe attempted to make a comeback with Auxerre after having a hip replacement operation. \n\"I've got pins in my legs, a pin in my hip. At the airport, I set off the alarms,\" he said. \n\"I had a great career -- you make some great friends. You play against each other, you get to know each other and football is like a little village. It's easy to make friends.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
