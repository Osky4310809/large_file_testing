That was against the Utah Jazz in 1998, which means Francesa might have thought he was interviewing ex-Jazz coach Jerry Sloan. Karl and the Sonics lost to Jordan's Bulls in 1996. Francesa had former Sonics coach George Karl in studio today. I'm pretty sure he thought he was interviewing former Jazz coach Jerry Sloan. pic.twitter.com/wcXIZ2PmrZ \nKudos Karl to being cool about it, though.
