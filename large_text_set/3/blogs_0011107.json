Rawlinson leads Lucid’s vehicle development team, and is a truly hands-on engineering executive who knows the hardware and business challenges involved in bringing a brand new EV to market. \nLocal Motors CEO Jay Rogers is equally eager to build the next-generation U.S. automotive brand, but he’s taking a very different approach. The former Marine and Harvard MBA built his company around the idea of vehicle concept “co-creation,” in which a community of over 30,000 individuals including designers, engineers, fabricators and fans collaborate on crowdsourced car designs. Local Motors wants to build vehicles tailor-made for micro-markets, eschewing the one-size fits most approach of many carmakers for something that offers specific answers to specific problems. \nBoth Lucid and Local offer a unique perspective on what it means to be the next great American car company, and we’re looking forward to hearing more about what they believe that entails at Disrupt NY 2017 . \nDisrupt NY runs May 15-17 at Pier 36, and you can purchase tickets to the event here . \nSponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
