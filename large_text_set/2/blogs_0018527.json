My sister Stacey assured me it was baby brain.” Tina was in a coma at once point as the encephalitis attacked her brain (Photo: Jim Bennett) \nThat day marked the last Tina remembers, until after she had given birth five months later. \nThe care worker said: “I don’t know what happened after that except I came around months later as an encephalitis survivor and a mother.” \nTina’s lengthy blackout started after being admitted to the local mental health hospital, St Martin’s, in September 2015 at just 21 years old, where she would spend the rest of her pregnancy learning to understand the growing bump on her stomach. \nShe said: “At times I was aware I was pregnant, but I didn’t want to acknowledge it, talk about it or let people take pictures of me.” Read More \nReduced to a shell, the family watched as a previously happy and bubbly Tina spent hours on her hospital bed, refusing to eat or drink and staring into space. \nTina would also repeatedly call out to her grandfather, who passed away a year before. \nAfter nearly a week in hospital and still undiagnosed, Tina began fitting and was sent for two lumbar punctures to test fluid from her spinal cord and an MRI scan. \nShe was seen by a neurologist consultant and a month later in October, diagnosed with encephalitis caused by an ovarian cyst, after an EEG brain scan showed swelling on her brain. \nKnown as an ovarian teratoma, this causes neurological problems due to the presence of tissue inside the cyst which produce antibodies known as B cells. \nThese cells enter the nervous system, causing damage to brain cells and in turn encephalitis. \nTina’s condition was treated with two plasma exchanges and given anti-seizure medication and steroids. \nIncredibly, Tina, a support worker, gave birth to Ava naturally in February 2016, but has no recollection the labour. \nShe said: “The birth is a total blank and the nurses tried to hand me Ava but I refused to hold her - my mum said I just freaked out. \n“I even questioned whether she was mine as I don’t remember giving birth.” \nAva arrived prematurely and spent a month in a neonatal unit and as Tina’s memory slowly returned, frequent visits to her incubator allowed the pair to bond. \nTina added: “I visited her every day while she was in neonatal, and started to feel more like her mother.

I overcame this while a tiny person was growing inside me.” ENCEPHALITIS \nWednesday marks World Encephalitis Day and landmarks across the world will be illuminated red to raise awareness. \nNiagara Falls, Trafalgar Square, Blackpool Tower and Newcastle’s Millennium Bridge will shine in support of educating more people about this life-threatening condition. \nWith 6,000 sufferers in the UK each year, an average of 10% are sadly not as fortunate as Tina and lose their life to encephalitis. \nThe condition occurs when an infection, sometimes originating from elsewhere in the body, spreads to the brain or when the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain. \nThis causes inflammation, which if occurs suddenly or rapidly and is left untreated, can be life-threatening. \nDespite its harrowing effects, research by The Encephalitis Society shows 67% of people don’t know what the condition is and 43% have never heard of it. \nDr Ava Easton, Chief Executive of the society, said: “In the UK, it affects more people annually than certain types of meningitis and motor neurone disease and yet remains less well known. \n“Encephalitis has a wide-spread and long-lasting impact which is why our aim is to make as many people aware of the symptoms.” \nSymptoms can include confusion or disorientation, seizures, drowsiness, changes in personality or seeing or hearing things that aren’t there. \nThe NHS advises to call 999 immediately if any anyone suspects they or someone else may be suffering from encephalitis.
