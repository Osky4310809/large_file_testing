On April 12, LSP coordinated with Axiall and a group of students to show a fake car crash. The parking lot at Sam Houston High School was converted into a staged scene of prom night gone wrong, reports KSLA via KPLC.\nTeens watched as eight of their peers acted out a scene where a drunk driver collided into another driver who wasn’t wearing a seat belt. That student ended up \"dead\" as the others were injured and taken to the hospital. Taylor Lyles acted as the dead driver who wasn’t wearing a seat belt, lying under a tarp, in a prom gown covered in blood.\n\"The purpose is to show the students what can happen if they make the decision to drink and drive, if they get in a vehicle with somebody who is impaired, not wear a seat belt and drive distracted. These are all things that contribute to crashes in our state and we don't want this to affect any of the students here and ruin their weekend,\" said Troop D spokesman, Sgt. James Anderson.\nLyles said the role has taught her a lesson she’ll never forget, according to Little Things.\n\"I remember the images of today as I'm driving and as I'm with my friends, remembering that our lives are important and it could go away with one mistake,\" she said.\n\"It just felt so real, it really did,\" said senior Taylor Soileau.\nSoileau wants other students to grasp the reality of the situation.\n\"Everyone kind of thinks that they're invincible. You know, it's not going to happen to me and this was kind of like, this can happen to you. It's real,\" said Soileau. \"It happens a lot and that could be your classmate that you see on a stretcher, in the newspaper.\"\nAnderson said the mock car crash is more effective when students see their own peers depicting the tragedy.\n\"It's all about peer involvement. The students showing what can happen to the other students makes a point that we as first responders can't always make because they reach their fellow students on a whole other level,\" he said. \"The students did a wonderful job with it. They really got into it and as a result, the students that watched got into it as well.\"\nThe current Sam Houston High School graduating class has lost four classmates -- two of them in car accidents -- so far.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:46:00.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
