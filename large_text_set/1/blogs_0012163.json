By Monday, however, the boot was gone and head coach Mike Tomlin seemed confident it would not be an issue for the upcoming game when he spoke at his press conference Tuesday. Nevertheless, Roethlisberger was among the names held out of practice on Wednesday.\nLIMITED: Davis (shoulder), Tuitt (ankle)\nFULL: Golden (ankle)\n— Missi Matthews (@missi_matthews) January 11, 2017 \nRelated: Roethlisberger endorses Todd Haley for head coaching job Most weeks, Wednesday has been a rest day for Roethlisberger, so his absence at this point in the week is not especially troubling. Should this linger into Thursday and beyond we will begin to get worried, but until then we will stick with the company line that the Steelers star quarterback will be fine for the divisional-round game.\nIt had been hoped Ladarius Green would be able to take part some in training to begin the week, even though he remains in concussion protocols. His availability for Sunday is somewhat questionable at this stage and fans should prepare for the worst worse again. Fitzgerald Toussaint is another player dealing with a concussion and as such his status for the weekend is equally uncertain.\nHaving missed the game against the Dolphins after failing to take part in training in the run-up to the game, it is disappointing to see both Anthony Chickillo and Ricardo Mathews still unable to practice. It is hard to be optimistic they will see a dramatic turnaround in the next few days, but anything is possible.\nRelated: Winter storm headed to Arrowhead as Steelers prepare to take on the Chiefs \nConsidering he battled through a shoulder issue to make it onto the field last Sunday, it is no surprise to see Vince Williams held out of practice once again. If he is to be able to try and do the same thing again at Arrowhead Stadium, Williams is likely to be given a limited workload for much of the week.\nEven though Sean Davis and Stephon Tuitt found themselves listed as limited, neither one should be in too much danger of missing the game in Kansas City. Davis picked up a shoulder injury that caused him to miss a few plays against Miami, although he was able to return. For Tuitt, his limited participation is most likely due to troubles he had recently with his knee.\nAfter showing some improvement on Friday, Robert Golden continues to work his way back from an ankle injury and was once again a full participant on Wednesday. He will be one to watch as we get closer to game day as he would be a valuable addition on special teams where the Steelers will surely need help.\nRelated: Martavis Bryant shares videos of him training, preparing for return to Steelers \nHere is the full participation report from Steelers.com\nSteelers: No Participation : TE Ladarius Green (Concussion), RB Le’Veon Bell (Not injury related), QB Ben Roethlisberger (Foot), RB Fitzgerald Toussaint (Concussion), LB Anthony Chickillo (Ankle), DE Ricardo Mathews (Ankle), LB Vince Williams (Shoulder).\nLimited Participation : S Sean Davis (Shoulder), Stephon Tuitt (Ankle).\nFull Participation : S Golden (Ankle)\nRelated: Steelers sign RB Gus Johnson to practice squad ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:30:55.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
