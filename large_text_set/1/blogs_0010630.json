However, in terms of characters, this is the shortest title, with 3 characters. This is the first episode where SpongeBob himself appears as a cameo. The second is \" Rise and Shine \" and the third is \" Mall Girl Pearl .\" This is the first episode to show clips from other episodes. The second is \" The Sponge Who Could Fly \" during the \"Remembering SpongeBob\" sequence. Squog says: \"Wait a minute\" at one point, the only full English sentence spoken by any of the Cavemen. Scenes from \" SB-129 \" are seen during the \" When Worlds Collide \" sequence. The scene with the Primitive Jellyfish first appeared in the episode \"SB-129.\" The futuristic shades Potty wore are similar to the ones Patrick wore in \" That's No Lady \" One of the foods SpongeGar cooks is a Krabby Patty replica made of sand. The caveman that Patchy found and thawed out is played by Bill Fagerbakke , who voices Patrick. Incidentally, Potty's robot is voiced by Tom Kenny , the actor of SpongeBob and Patchy. In the original airing and on the DVDs, the captions where the characters are speaking cave-ish are listed as \"speaking gibberish\" or \"gibberish\" in the dialogue. Example: SpongeGar's line \"Banooga ready!\" (which means \"I'm ready!\") is written as \"(speaking gibberish) Ready!\" The opening credits on the title card are also unique. This is the third time this has happened, the first two being \" SB-129 \" and \" Krusty Krab Training Video .\" Just like in the episodes \" Nature Pants ,\" \" Life of Crime ,\" \" The Camping Episode ,\" \" Party Pooper Pants ,\" and \" Pre-Hibernation Week ,\" fire is able to exist underwater. However, in \"Life of Crime,\" when Patrick noticed the fire, it went out instantly. Some people who saw the trailer for this episode thought that this would be a new spin-off series set in prehistoric times. This episode, like \" Party Pooper Pants \" and \" The Paper ,\" is infamous for being rarely aired on Nickelodeon. The French Narrator mistakenly referred to SpongeGar as \" SpongeBob \" at one point. The music used in the introduction of SpongeGar, Patar, and Squog is exactly the same music used in the title card of \" Rock Bottom .\" Running Gag: Patar putting salt on items and then eating them. Excluding the narrator, Patchy, Potty, Cavey, Potty's Robot, the actual SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs during the \"Meanwhile\" time card, none of the dialogue in the SpongeBob episode was edited in the Korean version. Most of the dialogue during the SpongeBob segment was left untranslated in the Russian dub, except for the narrator and a few parts, where the characters speak proper Russian instead of caveman. This is the second time an interjection is used as an episode title. The first time this was done is in \" Arrgh! \" This episode premiered three years after the premiere of \" Survival of the Idiots \" and \" Dumped .\" This episode has the shortest title. It is tied with \" F.U.N. \", as both episodes only have three letters in their name. Patchy's Caveman Cave house is in the Cretaceous period, while the past part of the cartoon part of the episode is in the Jurassic period. The Prehistoric part takes place sometime between 150,800,000 years and 148,500,000 years ago because Ammonites existed 400,000,000-66,000,000 years ago, Sponges started to exist sometime between 635,000,000 years and 541,000,000 years ago, Starfish started to exist sometime between 541,000,000 years and 485,400,000 years ago, Pterodactyls existed 150,800,000–148,500,000 years ago, crabs started to exist sometime between 201,300,000 and 145,000,000 years ago, Octopi started to exist 323,200,000, Snails started to exist sometime between 497,000,000 years and 485,400,000 years ago, and Jellyfish (shown on SpongeGar's cave wall) started to exist 505,000,000 years ago. This episode aired in Germany on September 18 , 2003 , before it aired in the USA. Cultural references Edit The atonal singing of the barbershop quartet is a reference to the piece \"Requiem for Soprano, Mezzo Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs, and Orchestra\" by György Ligeti, which was used in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey whenever the monolith appeared. Patchy finding Cavey in a block of ice and naming him \"Cavey\" is the same origin of how the Teen Angels found Captain Caveman. The scene in which SpongeGar realizes that he can use a stick as a tool to take a piece of coral out of the fire pays direct homage to the Dawn of Man sequence from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey , a famous scene in which a group of apes learn to use a bone as both a tool and weapon. In both cases, the narrative is portrayed these stories without the use of conventional dialogue (using nonsensical cave-ish speech in Ugh and using ape noises in 2001 . The music is also a direct homage, with a modernistic wailing piece composed by György Ligeti used while SpongeGar makes his discovery, and the classical piece \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\" by Richard Strauss played after SpongeGar's discovery, mirroring the use of those same two pieces of music in 2001 . B.C. being \"Before Comedy\" is a parody of what it actually is, \"Before Christ.\" The opening image of Prehistoric Bikini Bottom looks similar to the swamps of Degobah in Star Wars . The scene where SpongeGar and Patar clap on and off the storm is a reference to The Clapper light switch system. The scene where Squog crashes into a tree on a vine, it's a reference to when George of the Jungle crashes into a tree, as in, \"Watch out for that tree\". Errors Edit When Patar punctured his lip, the stick is thick, but when SpongeGar stomps on a little crab take out the stick out of Patar's lip and impaled a little crab and give him to it; the stick is thin. When Gary gets a snail trail on Squog's rocks, it is on the one closest to his house, but when Squog looks out the window, it is on the third one from his house. YTV captions error. In the original airing, the captions spell Patar's name as Pathar. YTV's captions spell Squog's name as Squd. Patchy has brown eyes throughout the episode, but when his eyes bulge out of his head, they are blue in color. Squog doesn't have a door on his house until he takes the fire to it. When Patchy tries to create fire, his hook is shown on his left hand, while in other scenes, it is on his right hand. Also, in the next frame after he introduces himself, he does not have his hook. While SpongeBob was sniffing his first charred flower on a stick, the roots were seen over his beard where the root parts over his beard were colored red. When Squog, Patar and SpongeGar went to their homes, they were still fat. But when they forgot the fire, they turned skinny fast. When Squog was choosing which club to use, he put the one he didn't want on the right. When it showed a close up view, it was moved to the left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T12:04:02.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
