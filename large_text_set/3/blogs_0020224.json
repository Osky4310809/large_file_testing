Firebrand Tomi Lahren May Have Burned Bridges With Pro-Choice Comment \n“I am a constitutional, y’know, someone that loves the Constitution,” she said. “I’m someone that’s for limited government. So I can’t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I’m for limited government, but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies. \n“I’m for limited government, so stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well,” Lahren said. \nOn his radio show Monday, Beck addressed what he described as the Lahren “dustup” by saying pro-choice supporters already work at his media company, so that alone is not why he disagrees with Lahren.   \nBut he questions the logic by which she arrived at her stance. \n“It takes intellectual honesty, and it takes a willingness to actually think these things through and to do more than just read Twitter or Facebook to get your news and your political opinions,” Beck said. “You actually have to study things — these things out in your mind. Especially at a time period like today. Bomb throwing is — bomb throwing in today’s world is dangerous. Freedom of speech, it’s not free. Speech isn’t free. It comes with a very high price tag. First, being intellectually honest and intellectually curious. Speech is not free. It comes with another cost and usually to the other people at the other end of your argument. The pen is mightier than the sword, and it can destroy people if your aim is clicks, views, and ratings.” \nLahren said via Twitter Saturday that she is an “independent thinker.” I have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker. \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:52:58.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
