It’s absolutely right because it’s supposed to be for Comic Relief, but there isn’t much comic relief in the loss of our dear friend really, only just over a year ago.” Red Nose Day, for fellow Yanks who aren’t familiar, often features celebrities doing silly sketches — like Game of Thrones the Musical, for example — to raise money for various children’s charities. So Thompson is correct to assume that Red Nose Day Actually will be a lighthearted affair, and not necessarily the appropriate venue for grieving a recent death.\nUniversal Pictures “We thought and thought but it just seemed wrong but to revisit the wonderful fun characters of Bill Nighy and Hugh Grant and Liam [Neeson] and all of that,” Thompson continued. “That’s fantastic, but obviously, what would [Curtis] have done?”\nHowever, even though Thompson won’t be appearing in the project, she did give Love Actually fans a little gift in the form of what she thinks her character, Karen, would be doing today.\n“Both of them would be in therapy by now, and I would be working on some kind of ward,” she concluded. “[Not doing the sequel] was absolutely the right decision.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:19:32.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
