Jefferson St. It’s not an old-school deli in the same vein as Manny’s or The Bagel. Aesthetics aside, neither of those venerable restaurants serve craft beer, 11 craft cocktails, or even a “Boomerang”—a special bar industry secret. The menu will rotate. For opening day it will feature 10 sandwiches including a decadent-looking grilled cheese (stacked with fontina, Swiss, and cheddar on parmesan-crusted sourdough) and something for the carnivores. The gym shoe is sliced lamb, corned beef, sliced beef, tzatziki mayo, giardiniera, shredded lettuce, on an Italian baguette. Sandwiches range from $8 to $12. While Revival’s coffee bar offered coffees from a variety of roasters, Ruin will exclusively serve Metric. The Ruin will open only on weekdays. Designers embraced the all-day cafe/bar vibe with light-colored woods that don’t absorb too much sun. This isn’t a dark divey spot to find an escape. It’s a bright place with modern coffee shop stylings, very reminiscent of Revival. Check out the photos and menu below.
