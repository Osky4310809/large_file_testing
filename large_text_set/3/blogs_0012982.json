The Medical Examiner will determine how he died, NYPD officials said. \nIt wasn't immediately clear if any criminality was involved, but police said they were still investigating. There were no immediate arrests. \nInvestigators found the apartment littered with some Shake Shack wrappers and said that Tamiguchi liked to eat there, sources said. \nIt wasn't immediately clear if anyone was home with Tamiguchi before he was found dead. Police did not say what school he attended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:47:58.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
