Could   \nAntonio Conte has warned Chelsea face a “wounded animal” when they head to Anfield on Tuesday night. \nLiverpool have suffered three home defeats in a week that has seen them dumped out of the EFL and FA Cups and left them lagging behind in the title race. \nChelsea cruised into the last 16 despite making nine changes to the starting XI for Saturday’s west London derby win against Brentford. \nThe Blues also have an eight–point cushion at the top of the Premier League but Conte insists the Reds are “dangerous” opponents as Jurgen Klopp demands a response from his struggling side.

Their focus will be very high. We’ll have great difficulty because when you arrive after three defeats you are very angry and we must know this. \n“I’m sure that Liverpool is one of the teams that can fight to the end to win the title. They have a good coach, really good players. \n“The crowd pushes them a lot and we must pay attention to this atmosphere because it will help them, but we have to play our football.” Klopp's Reds have lost three in a row at home (Photo: Liverpool Echo) Conte and Fabregas embrace at full-time (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Read More Liverpool 1-2 Wolves: Jurgen Klopp in crisis after second cup exit this week \nConte insists his Chelsea team have made massive progress since their home defeat against the Reds earlier in the season. \nThe Blues have lost just once in their last 15 games, while Klopp’s men have endured a disastrous start to 2017. \nConte added: “After four months a lot of things are changed. We are growing and improving a lot. We have a good confidence. I think that it will be more difficult for Liverpool.” \nKlopp paid the price for fielding a weakened side as Liverpool lost to Wolves at the weekend, but the Italian showed Chelsea have plenty in reserve after his second-string thumped Brentford. \nGoals from Willian, Pedro, the departing Branislav Ivanovic and Michy Batshuayi sealed their spot in the fifth round.
