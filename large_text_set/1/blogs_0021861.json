The unusual plea stemmed from a Politico story which stated that Cruz started a weekly basketball game where he urged fellow colleagues to attend. \nSend us proof of Ted Cruz playing basketball https://t.co/MgGLnsscPf pic.twitter.com/mpxI5EBQkK \n— Deadspin (@Deadspin) January 23, 2017 \n\nThen something incredible happened. The U.S. Senator from Texas became self-aware that he oddly resembles Grayson Allen (Ted Cruz also looks like a woman who appeared on Maury and Kevin from The Office ). \nTed Cruz then savagely trolled Deadspin with this one blistering tweet. \n@Deadspin what do I win? pic.twitter.com/9XuRmmIkJS \n— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 25, 2017 \n\nAnd just like that, Ted blew up Deadspin with his Cruz missile. \nLeft in shock, Deadspin could only muster this comeback. \n@tedcruz Go eat shit.\n— Deadspin (@Deadspin) January 25, 2017 \n\nTed then brought down the basketball ring with this powerful follow-up dunk. \n@Deadspin pic.twitter.com/TMiDBco2TB \n— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 25, 2017 \n\nWho knew that Ted had memes? Ted probably should have used some memes when he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. \nThe Zodiac Killer strikes again. \n\nCruz, who is not winning the “Most Beloved Person in the Universe” Award anytime soon, was heralded as winning the internet on this night. \nYou can say whatever you want about Ted Cruz's politics, but he just ethered Deadspin. pic.twitter.com/Mlx1Tn0ZX2 \n— Single Malt Fiend (@Singlemaltfiend) January 25, 2017 \nlol @deadspin go home. you lost a likablity contest to Ted Cruz.\nYou're bad at this.\n— David Rutz (@DavidRutz) January 25, 2017 \nDeadspin just got pwned by Ted Cruz. Twice. pic.twitter.com/KmEk7X1y3e \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) January 25, 2017 \nOfficial list of media entities that have ever been owned by both Peter Thiel and Ted Cruz:\n1.
