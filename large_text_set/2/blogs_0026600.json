Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia ’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nIf you’ve been thinking about taking a trip to Paris , now’s the time to book. British Airways and OpenSkies are having a fare sale on flights from New York to Paris, made even more appealing by two stackable discounts. Flight are available at scattered times throughout the year, but it might take some clicking around to see which dates are eligible for the discounted fares.\nHere are the two stackable discounts you can take advantage of in order to get the lowest possible fare:\nBA’s AARP discount allows you to save $65 off economy fares.
