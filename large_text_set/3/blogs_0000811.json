Chelsea want to sign a new striker and are watching Torino's Belotti (Photo: LightRocket via Getty) \nChelsea hope to hold on to Costa at the end of the season despite interest from Chinese club Tianjin Quinjan, but they to bring in another striker whatever happens. \nProlific Torino frontman Andrea Belotti has been watched, while Conte is an admirer of Swansea's Fernando Llorente — who scored against his side at Stamford Bridge last Saturday. \nThe contract situation of Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez is also being monitored. The champions-elect would also be keen to make this more than some nifty Photoshopping (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nChelsea among a number of clubs ready to register their interest if the Chilean - who will have a year left on his current deal in the summer - continues to refuse to sign a new pact. \nConte is also ready to re-integrate young Tammy Abraham, who has scored 18 goals on loan at Championship side Bristol City this season, into the squad for the 2017-18 campaign.
