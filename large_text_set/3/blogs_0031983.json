According to Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press, Riddick is expected to be ready for organized team activities , which begin in May. \nAbility is less the issue in the Lions’ backfield. \nDurability is. \nBetween ankle and wrist ailments, Riddick missed six games in 2016. He still finished with 53 receptions for 371 yards and five touchdowns while adding a career-high 357 rushing yards and an additional score. Ameer Abdullah suffered a Week 2 foot injury that ended his season. He also is expected to be ready for OTAs. \nNo Lions player gained more than 70 rushing yards in a game last season. \nBirkett postulated the team “could look to add a running back high in April’s draft or sign an aging veteran as insurance.” This draft class is widely viewed to be well stocked at the position.
