Trump , to halt the recent executive order that placed new immigration restrictions on people from seven majority-Muslim nations.\nOn Friday in federal court in Seattle, US District Judge James L. Robart ruled against the government, finding that a temporary restraining order was warranted, and that the president overstepped his bounds. For now, the Seattle judge’s nationwide ruling stands—late Saturday night, the 9th Circuit rejected the government’s attempt to get an emergency stay of the order.\nFurther Reading Tech sector begins legal assault on Trump immigration order [Updated] In the Sunday night 53-page amicus filing, the corporations forcefully argued in favor of America’s history as a \"nation of immigrants,\" and noted that if the order is allowed to stand, \"American workers and the economy will suffer as a result.\" \n \nThe filing came less than two months after high-level executives from several tech companies, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, attended a \"summit\" with the then-president-elect at Trump Tower in New York.\nAccording to earlier reporting by the Seattle Times , over 21,000 Washington residents were born in Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, and Yemen. In court filings, state lawyers said that over 7,000 state residents were affected by the ban.\nEarlier on Friday, government lawyers in a related case in Virginia said that at least 60,000 and possibly as many as 100,000 people have had their visas revoked as a result of the executive order.\nThis story is developing.
