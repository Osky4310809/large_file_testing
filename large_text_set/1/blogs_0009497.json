But how do you go about creating the perfect colour scheme for your design\nThese apps can all help you pick the perfect palette, to make your design sing. And the best news is, they’re all completely free. \nIf there’s another free colour picker app you feel we should have included, though, please let us know in the comments below!\n01. Color Hunter \nUpload an image and generate a colour scheme with this free web app Color Hunter is a browser-based tool that lets you find and make colour palettes created from images. Just upload your image and get a palette based on the colours it contains. \nAlternatively, enter a search term in the box at the top of the page; Color Hunter then searches Flickr.com for matching images and uses them to create a colour palette.\n02. ColorExplorer \nUse ColorExplorer to create palettes and then export them to software like Photoshop ColorExplorer is a free online toolbox for designing and working with colour palettes. Developed for professional designers, it’s been in development since 2006 and all features are free to use. These include colour matching; browsing popular colour libraries; conversion hints between multiple colour libraries (RAL, TOYO, and more); palette export for use in software like Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign; colour palette analysis and import from images and text files; and centrally stored palettes for easy access.\n03. Paletton \nPaletton uses colour theory to present you with harmonious colour combinations Formerly known as Color Scheme Designer, Paletton is a designer tool for creating colour combinations that work together well. You start with a base colour, and Paletton then generates similar shades that will complement it. In this way, the web app guides you through building up a colour palette for your design based on one of five styles, which it calls Mono, Complement, Triad, Tetrad and Free style.\n04. COPASO \nCOPASO lets you create a colour scheme in three ways COPASO is an advanced colour palette creator from creative community COLOURlovers (they also provide a more basic alternative here ). COPASO’s one-stop interface lets you create a colour scheme in one of three ways: choosing colours, uploading images, or entering CMYK or HEX values. You can save and publish your colour palettes, and there’s even the handy ability to add notes to them.\n05. Colorzilla \nWith ColorZilla you can get a colour reading from any point in your browser Colorzilla is an extension for Chrome and Firefox browsers to assist designers with colour related tasks, both basic and advanced. With ColorZilla you can get a colour reading from any point in your browser, adjust this colour, and paste it into another program. You can also analyse the page, inspect a palette of its colours, and create advanced multi-stop CSS gradients. \n06. Pictaculous \nPictaculous lets you generate a colour palette from any photo or image Pictaculous is a colour palette tool from email marketing giants MailChimp that enables you to generate a colour palette from any photo or image, in PNG, JPG or GIF format. It also gives you suggestions from COLOURlovers of similar colour palettes, and lets you download an Adobe Swatch of your chosen palette.\n07. Coolers.co \nCoolers.co generates a new palette every time you press the spacebar Coolers.co is a web app that offers a quite unusual way to find the right colour scheme. Basically, every time you press the spacebar a new palette is generated, so the idea is you keep going until you find the right inspiration. Alternatively, you can browse through the various palettes that other users have found and liked.\n08. Color Hunt \nColor Hunt offers a curated collection of colour palettes Similar to Coolers.co above, Color Hunt offers a “curated collection of beautiful colors, updated daily”. Add its Chrome extension to your browser, and you’ll get a new colour palette every time you refresh your browser window.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T13:18:02.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
