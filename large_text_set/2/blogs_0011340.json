DNS is essentially the yellow pages of web addresses. \n“The name servers … were producing high-volume alerts and showed an abnormal number of sub-domains related to seafood,” according to Verizon’s Data Breach Digest report. \nVerizon’s RISK Team gathered data from the university and the “analysis identified over 5,000 discrete systems making hundreds of DNS lookups every 15 minutes.” \nThe server requests were coming from the school’s internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, meaning the many everyday devices that are connected to the internet. The servers struggled to keep up with these unusual requests and it slowed down the network. \n“Everything from light bulbs to vending machines had been connected to the network for ease of management and improved efficiencies,” the report explains of the school’s makeup. A botnet (a portmanteau of “robot” and “network”) was sending malware (a portmanteau of malicious software, or a virus) to the internet-connected devices, and would change the password–locking the IT staff out of the 5,000 systems. \nRather than directly replace every one of the malware-infected devices, Verizon’s RISK Team was able to inspect the network traffic, “intercept the clear text password for a compromised IoT device” and then perform a password change before the next malware update.

In a very similar situation, a Los Angeles college paid hackers $28,000 to remove infected software from its computer systems after cybercriminals took the school’s data hostage. \nIn October, a number of popular websites were inaccessible for people living in the Northeast of the U.S. after a botnet overwhelmed nameservers by sending tons of a data over and over again to one place.
