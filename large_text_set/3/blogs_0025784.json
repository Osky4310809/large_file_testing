Today, Google stated that on June 26, Gmail users will be automatically transitioned to Hangouts, unless they have any previous contractual commitments. If you are still using the old Google Talk Android app, which was replaced with Hangouts in 2013 in the Google Play Store, that app will now stop working. These latest moves should come as no surprise as Google Talk support has been on life support for the past few years.\nIn related news, a number of Gmail Lab add-ons will be retired on or around April 24. They include Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews. Finally, two legacy Google+ features in Gmail, the ability to email Google+ profiles and the use of Google+ Circles, will also be retired on April 24.\nThis news comes as Google also confirmed it plans earlier this week to remove SMS text messaging services to Hangouts on May 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:02:58.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
