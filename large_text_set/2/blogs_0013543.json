(Being 6’4″ probably helps.) Last year, the Arcade Fire frontman was named MVP of the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game , leading Team Canada to a 74-64 victory over Team USA. And last night, he returned to play in his third NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, joining an East versus West roster including Stranger Things ’ Caleb McLaughlin, Master P and his son Romeo Miller, Peter Rosenberg, Mark Cuban, Nick Cannon, Ansel Elgort, and more. Once again, Butler’s team won, 88-59 this time, with Butler himself scoring 22 points and 11 rebounds. He also wore Jimi Hendrix socks .
