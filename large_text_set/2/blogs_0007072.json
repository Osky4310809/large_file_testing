His missed dunk against the Thunder was on of those times. \nDuring Thursday's game, James broke free on a fast break and went up for a dunk, hitting back rim. The Thunder's Victor Oladipo was trailing James for the contest, but he didn't appear to make contact with James. Still, watch what LeBron did after missing the dunk. LeBron wanted a foul. â€” Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 10, 2017 \nJames went to the ground and continued to slide twice and immediately got up to argue with the official. The argument James had was that Olapido clipped his left leg, but upon seeing the replay, it didn't seem like there was contact. \nDespite James' best efforts to get the foul call on the dunk, the Cavaliers' Jordan McRae scored off the rebound and was fouled anyway.
