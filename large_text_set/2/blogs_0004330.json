Could   \nAnyone who has spent time in Brazil will probably have heard the phrase \"complexo de vira-lata\". Football-obsessed playwright Nelson Rodrigues coined it in the 1950s, referring primarily to the trauma of the Maracanazo – Brazil's shock World Cup defeat to Uruguay – but it has since taken on a life of its own, spawning academic studies and working its way into the country's towering lexicon of home-brewed aphorisms. \nIt translates as \"mongrel complex\" and refers to a self-imposed feeling of national inferiority. \"Brazilians are upside-down narcissists who spit on their own image,\" Rodrigues wrote. On this view, a population that sees \"no personal or historical pretext for self-confidence\" looks out into the world and feels diminished by comparisons to other (mainly western) countries. \nOne of the symptoms of the affliction – and we are of course generalising here – is that Brazil cares what others think. This can be seen in everyday language (the phrase \"para inglês ver\" – literally \"for the English to see\" – is an eye-rolling allusion to keeping up appearances) and, most significantly, in the media, where outlets frequently carry stories about how local events are being covered around the world. Gabriel in action for Brazil (Photo: REUTERS) Gabriel enjoyed a superb final season in Brazil (Photo: AFP/Getty) Gabriel with his family (Photo: dejesusoficial/Instagram) \nThe recent spate of violence in Brazilian prisons, for instance, hit the headlines around the world and those headlines were pumped back into the echo chamber. Stories about outrageously outmoded beauty contests and governmental corruption follow a similar pattern. Often, this is done with cringe implied; at the embarrassment Olympics, Brazil always sees itself as a medal contender.

At which point, enter Gabriel Jesus: instant Premier League idol and Brazil's new leading export. Gabriel as a youngster (Photo: dejesusoficial/Instagram) Gabriel and a friend (Photo: dejesusoficial/Instagram) Gabriel scores against West Ham (Photo: REUTERS) \nThe teenager's Manchester City career may only be 278 minutes old, but already a cottage industry has sprung up to cover his exploits – and the international coverage of them. A cursory glance at a few major Brazilian news portals is instructive: headlines like \"Gabriel Jesus impresses English media\", \"Gabriel Jesus back among the headlines in England,\" and \"English papers don't hold back in praise of Gabriel Jesus\" hint at the excitement. A montage of the back pages after City's win over West Ham did the rounds on Thursday; those predictable \"Jesus!\" puns that everyone made on Twitter were retweeted gleefully. The buzz is being felt on both sides of the Atlantic. \nGabriel's pedigree was not in any doubt when he upped sticks for Manchester. The teenager had played a starring role in Palmeiras' Série A title win, blossoming from rough-hewn upstart into genuine superstar-in-waiting within the space of a few months. When he left São Paulo, he did so as Brazil's starting striker and with the Bola de Ouro player of the year trophy tucked in his suitcase. This was no unheralded ingenu. Gabriel on the front page of 'O Globo' after scoring for City The former Palmeiras man scores a 92nd-minute winner against Swansea (Photo: PA) Gabriel Jesus on the front page of a Brazilian paper 'Lance!' \nStill, few expected him to make such an immediate impact. Plenty of youngsters have failed to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League, for a start, while culture shock was a possibility, even if Gabriel's entourage and City's cadre of Brazilians were always likely to soften his landing. The growing pains of Brazil Olympic team-mate Gabriel Barbosa, long tipped for the top yet still seeking his first goal since swapping Santos for Internazionale in August, provided a cautionary tale about the dangers of lofty expectations. Read More City believe Gabriel Jesus will help make Sergio Aguero BETTER rather than replace him \nWe know better now. \"Jesus' instantaneous success is abnormal for a player moving away at the age of 19,\" wrote O Globo columnist Carlos Eduardo Mansur, who swooned at \"the swiftness with which he's made an impression in one of the most tactically demanding leagues in the world.\" Even Pep Guardiola, whose phone call initially convinced the striker that his future lay the Etihad, admitted that he and his staff had been \"a bit surprised by his level\". We can safely assume that Sergio Aguero, who has worn a look of mildly-titillated bemusement on the bench over the last couple of weeks, shares that view. Gabriel has settled in quicker than expected (Photo: Twitter/@ManCity) Pep Guardiola personally called Gabriel to seal his move to Manchester (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nThese are early days, but if he keeps up anything like this level of performance, Gabriel will join Neymar right at the top of the list of Brazil's best exports of the last decade. Certainly, few players have made a comparable impact after moving to one of Europe's major leagues; Gabriel Barbosa, Lucas Silva, Gérson, Malcom, Lucas Moura and Juan Jesus have struggled to a greater or lesser degree. And it's worth noting that while Neymar played over 200 times for Santos, Gabriel made just 83 senior appearances for Palmeiras. He is still learning his craft and there should be much more to come. Read More Gabriel Jesus makes our Premier League team of the week - but who else is involved? \nThis is not just good news for Manchester City; Brazil, too, should benefit. Guardiola's current system is not dissimilar to the one used by Seleção boss Tite, who also encourages Gabriel to get involved in the build-up and swap positions with his fellow attackers. The results so far have been startling – five goals in six starts for in the yellow jersey – but the hope is that Guardiola's tutelage can take him to the next level. \"He went to the right club,\" Tite said in October. Gabriel after arriving in England with his family (Photo: dejesusoficial/Instagram) Even the weather doesn't seem to have dampened spirits (Photo: dejesusoficial/Instagram) \nFor now, though, the future can wait. For even in the present tense, Gabriel is a gift – and not just to fans. Among his growing fan club is Juninho Paulista, a man who knows a knows a thing or two about making it in England. \"His strength of personality is impressive for one so young,\" the former Middlesbrough playmaker told GloboEsporte. \"He has the characteristics of English football: he's quick, gets forward and is always looking for the ball. His amazing start is down to his personality and his style of play.\" Former City midfielder Elano has hailed Gabriel's \"great maturity\" and confidence on the pitch. \nThat seems right: success in these cases is not just about technical ability, but also about strength of character and serenity. Gabriel Jesus, as Premier League supporters are already starting to see, has both in spades. This thoroughbred has no time for the mongrel complex.
