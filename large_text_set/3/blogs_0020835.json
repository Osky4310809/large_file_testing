But the majority may not really be sure, since they may also depend on their sex partners to rate their performance. \nAnd, since a faithful mate may not want to destroy her man’s bedroom confidence, she may give him a pass mark even if he really falls below par! \nHowever, with a new condom range in town, men can now know their authentic performance level based on scientific rating! \nA new condom range that states penis size when measured around the middle (girth), the number of thrusts per round of sex, and a man’s sexual health are all possible now. \nThe smart condom ring, being a wearable technology designed by the i.Con, now makes the job of measuring a man’s sexual performance easy! \nManufactured by British Condoms, i.Con is a fitness tracker for the penis. \nIt provides the wearer with performance statistics while also promising to detect signs of sexually transmitted infections. \nThis range of condoms are so smart that once a man wears one, it can track the number of calories burnt, calculate the duration of intercourse, the average number of thrusts and girth (penis size) measurements. \nBritish Condoms says the ring, which is used in addition to (rather than instead of) a regular condom, is in the final stages of testing and will be released later this year. \n“It’s truly a revolutionary day,” said the project’s lead engineer, Adam Leverson. \n“Not only have we innovated the world’s first smart condom ring that’ll measure pretty much every aspect of performance in the bedroom, but now I’m pleased to confirm that it will also have built-in indicators to alert the users to any potential STIs present,” Leverson assures. \nWhile British Condoms is keeping further images and details under wraps until closer to the launch, the company says the ring is embedded with a nanochip that communicates with a smartphone app via Bluetooth. \nUsers will be able to share their data publicly if they desire, with the option to do so anonymously. The ring is powered by a battery that allows up to eight hours of usage from a single charge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:34:58.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
