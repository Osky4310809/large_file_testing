(NOK) By Nathan Reiff | February 16, 2017 â€” 5:21 PM EST \nIt is easy to think of phone technology as moving along the same fixed, forward path as most other technological developments: successive iterations of phones released by the major manufacturers always sport the best and newest technological features , typically in smaller and smaller packages. While this appeals to many consumers, there is also a reason to believe that this trend may be reversing itself for a certain population of phone buyers. Recently, brands like Nokia have announced plans to release phones that are intentionally \"dumb,\" which is to say that they will not feature the trendiest and most powerful technological gadgets and features. Why would companies choose to do this, and who might be interested in buying these \"dumbphones?\" Security Concerns \nA recent article by CNN documented the difficulties NASA engineer Sidd Bikkannavar experienced as he was trying to re-enter the United States from a trip to South America just weeks ago. Although Bikkannavar's trip followed the controversial \"Muslim ban\" issued by President Trump, Bikkannavar himself would not be affected by the ban due to his status as a U.S.-born citizen and the nature of his visit to an unaffected country. Nonetheless, Bikkannavar was forced to give up his phone as part of a security clearance procedure as he passed through customs control. In Bikkannavar's case, such a decision was a difficult one to make: the phone contained ample sensitive and secure information related to his work on NASA projects. \nBikkannavar's predicament could easily be translated to numerous other types of employment in which a worker may carry sensitive information on a personal device such as a phone or laptop. Given heightened security procedures at airports and other areas of entry into the United States, consumers in these fields are becoming more and more concerned with the safety of their devices. To these customers, a dumbphone may be a more attractive option, at least while traveling. No Apps? \nCompanies like Nokia ( NOK ) and Samsung have already designed phones that are specifically made for people wishing to keep things simple. The Nokia 3310 , for example, is built to not accommodate apps and other downloadable features that most traditional smartphones today work to accommodate. It is not a far stretch to imagine other companies rolling out phones that also have no capability to download apps . Should the phone's user run into a situation in which security personnel wish to look through the contents of the phone, the items that will be visible will naturally be limited. While this is hardly a trend at this point , some analysts expect that more and more consumers will be interested in scaling back their phone capabilities for these reasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:13:42.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
