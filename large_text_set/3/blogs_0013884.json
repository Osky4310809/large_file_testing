O’Neil, center, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), right. (Mary Altaffer/AP) The New York City Police Department says that President Trump’s proposed budget, which includes sweeping cuts across the government , would gut “critical” efforts to fight terrorism in the nation’s largest city.\nPolice say the funding cuts would hit everything from intelligence analysis to active-shooter training. The blunt assessment was delivered by the top law enforcement officer in Trump’s hometown, who leads an agency tasked with defending the city against terrorism — and, more recently, protecting Trump Tower since it became a de facto “ White House north ” while first lady Melania Trump and her son, Barron, are living there.\n“Under the president’s proposal, nearly all federal funding to the NYPD would be eradicated,” James P. O’Neill, the New York City police commissioner, said at a briefing Thursday afternoon. “This funding is absolutely critical. It is the backbone of our entire counter-terrorism apparatus.”\n[ What Trump cut in his budget ]\nThe Trump administration has defended its budget cuts as necessary and say they follow through on the president’s messaging throughout the campaign. But O’Neill’s criticism appears to undercut two pillars of Trump’s candidacy and the early days of his presidency, as Trump has portrayed himself as a defender of law and order and a strong protector of national security.\nUnder @POTUS budget, virtually all fed funding to #NYPD eradicated.

Authorities later said that the man accused of that bombing hoped to stage a suicide attack in the city.\n[ Ahmad Rahami, suspected New York bomber, cited al-Qaeda and ISIS, officials say ]\n“New York City remains one of the top terror targets in the world, and certainly the top target in the United States,” he said. “The federal government has long acknowledged that fact, and to cut that funding would make us increasingly less safe.”\nThe NYPD remains the country’s largest local police department, with about 34,500 uniformed officers on the force, equal to the population of a small city. According to the New York City Council, the NYPD’s annual budget for the 2017 fiscal year was $5.2 billion.\nO’Neill said the proposed federal budget would “completely cut” state and local grant funding from the Department of Homeland Security, which he said would cost the NYPD about $110 million that the department receives annually through the Homeland Security Grant Program .\nDuring the 2016 fiscal year, the program had more than $1 billion in funding available overall, including more than half a million dollars aimed at addressing the “needs of high-threat, high-density urban areas” — in other words, highly populated metropolitan areas facing the risk of terrorism, like New York City.\nIn the 2016 fiscal year, the New York area received more than $178 million in funding, more than the Chicago and Los Angeles areas received combined, according to the Department of Homeland Security .\nO’Neill said it was not yet clear what impact the proposed budget would have on the NYPD’s other daily policing activities.\nPart of the department’s more recent activities include protecting Trump Tower. While police officials estimated that it could cost New York half a million dollars each day to guard Trump Tower, they recently lowered that estimate .\nFurther reading:\nThe FBI and NYPD make peace and focus on fighting terror, not each other\nTrump’s DHS budget includes billions to build his border wall\nRead President Trump’s first budget proposal", "external_links": ["https://www.fema.gov/homeland-security-grant-program", "https://twitter.com/@markberman", "https://twitter.com/POTUS", "https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1467836973305-76b1650140531d2fab3f08e67f755572/FY_2016_HSGP_Fact_Sheet.pdf", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/nyregion/nypd-security-trump-tower.html", "https://twitter.com/NYPDONeill/status/842476621525315587", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NYPD?src=hash"], "published": "2017-03-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:21:50.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
