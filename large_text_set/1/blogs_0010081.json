He’s often selfie-ing in customized leather jackets that would make Sid Vicious envious, slinking around in Vetements -esque shearling coats, and showing off his pants, which are usually covered in patches or have dad jean tendencies. His accessory game isn’t too shabby either: Yoshi has made a bold chain-lock choker his signature, but will sometimes switch it out with a highlighter yellow Off-White belt . In other words: Hook this kid up with a styling gig! \nHe’s the king of the elevator selfie: Move over, Kim Kardashian West and Emily Ratajkowski ! Yoshi takes almost all of his photos in an elevator with seemingly claustrophobic proportions. But the yawn-worthy setting lends great contrast to his pieces, such as a pair of glinting silver pointy toe boots . \nSpeaking of shoes . . . Yoshi may be the most confident kid on the planet: Do you know any other 13-year-old boys who can rock a pair of shiny go-go boots ? \nHe’s the most popular boy on the block: Yoshi boasts quite the social circle: He gets his coif customized by Tokyo’s coolest hairstylist Haruka Hatakeyama . Also, he’s a mini heartthrob in the making , often flanked by local It girls like Yuki Sugimura and Lyla Iwamoto . \nFun fact: He’s met idol Virgil Abloh of Off-White and has a pretty great picture to prove it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:28:02.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
