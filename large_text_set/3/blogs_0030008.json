The states joining Texas in the brief include Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and West Virginia. \n\"Rather than leaving national security in limbo while litigation dragged on, President Trump issued a revised immigration order that addresses the 9th Circuit's concerns and is a vital step in securing our borders,\" Paxton said in a statement. \"It is imperative we find a way to better screen refugee applicants to maintain national security. The president is fulfilling his solemn duty to protect Texans and all Americans.\" \nIn the brief , the states argued that they have a \"significant interest in protecting their residents' safety.\" \n\"Congress delegated to the Executive Branch significant authority to prohibit aliens' entry into the country, and the challenged Executive Order is a lawful exercise of that authority,\" the brief stated. \"Plaintiffs' lawsuit presents no basis to enjoin the order.\" \nLitigation regarding Trump's travel ban is ongoing in several courts simultaneously.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:40:33.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
