The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many \"coincidences\" tied to it. https://t.co/8HA9y30Yfp \n— Michael Flynn Jr (@mflynnJR) December 5, 2016 \nRadio host Alex Jones discussed parts of the “pizzagate” conspiracy in a massively popular interview on the Joe Rogan podcast recently. \nWatch: Trump Begins Pedophile Roundup, Sandusky’s Son Arrested On Sex Charges NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.
