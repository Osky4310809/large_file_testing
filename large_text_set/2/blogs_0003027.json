The two committees deal with many of the nation’s most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism. \nAlso among those whose computer systems may have been compromised is Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Democrat who was previously the target of a disastrous email hack when she served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign. \nThe brothers are suspected of serious violations, including accessing members’ computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from Congress. \nJamal handled IT for Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat who serves on both the intelligence and foreign affairs panels. \n“As of 2/2, his employment with our office has been terminated,” Castro spokeswoman Erin Hatch told TheDCNF Friday. \nJamal also worked for Louisiana Democrat Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is on the Committee on Homeland Security. \nImran worked for Reps. Andre Carson, an Indiana Democrat, and Jackie Speier, a California Democrat. Carson and Speier are members of the intelligence committee. Spokesmen for Carson and Speier did not respond to TheDCNF’s requests for comments. Imran also worked for the House office of Wasserman-Schultz. \nThen-Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, employed Abid for IT work in 2016. She was a member of House committees dealing with the armed services, oversight, and Benghazi. Duckworth was elected to the Senate in November, 2016. Abid has a prior criminal record and a bankruptcy. \nAbid also worked for Rep. Lois Frankel, a Florida Democrat who is member of the foreign affairs committee. Indiana Rep.

It is up to each member to fire them from working. \nA criminal investigation into five unnamed people began late last year related to serious and potentially illegal violations of House IT policies, Politico reported Thursday. Chiefs of staff for the members were briefed Thursday by the Sergeant-at-Arms. \nCapitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki said the investigation was still ongoing, and arrests have not been made but staff were “asked to update their security settings.” \nBuzzfeed reported Friday that one of the affected members claimed “they said it was some sort of procurement scam, but now I’m concerned that they may have stolen data from us, emails, who knows.” \nJamal did not return a request for comment from TheDCNF at a personal email address, while emails to House addresses in the three mens’ names bounced back Friday. \nBuzzfeed reported that the Sergeant-at-Arms told staff that the subjects were four men who were brothers and one woman. It did not name them. \nAnother man, Omar Awan, is a senior IT specialist for the House’s Chief Administrative Officer. An email to his House address did not bounce back Friday, but did not receive a response. \nAbid, Imran and Jamal share a house in Lorton, Virginia, that is owned by Hina R. Alvi, a woman. Alvi is also a House IT employee who works for many of the same members as the three brothers, as well as the House Democratic Caucus.

The Congressional Credit Union repossessed Abid’s car in 2009, and he declared bankruptcy in 2012, facing multiple lawsuits. \nSecurity-sensitive jobs typically require background checks for credit and legal problems that can create pressures to cash in on access to secret information and documents. \nAlvi has multiple second mortgages. She did not respond to TheDCNF’s request for comment. \nJamal, who public records indicate is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000. \nFollow Luke on Twitter . Send tips to .
