Free Cone Day is fast approaching and will be here on Tuesday, April 4. Anyone who has ever experienced this glorious day knows it's worth marking your calendars for and planning a trip with a group of your ice-cream-loving friends. This year, Ben & Jerry's will give out free ice cream from 12 p.m. through 8 p.m. in participating scoop shops across the country. That means you can choose you favorite flavor, get a free cone (or cup), and get back in line for a second round â€” seriously, Ben & Jerry's even encourages it.\nWhile you won't be able to get Ben & Jerry's new Pint Slices for free, there are plenty of sweet flavors to choose from, including a new chocolaty flavor called Truffle Kerfuffle . If you seriously can't decide, Ben & Jerry's even has a Free Cone Day quiz to help determine the best flavor for your personality. Be sure to pencil this into your schedule for the day, because the only the better than ice cream is free ice cream, right?\nImage Source: Ben & Jerry's", "external_links": ["http://www.benjerry.com/", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/XJzxRD2J5YN7u3_j0UA_hzKwPLY/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/28/815/n/1922195/4dfdba39ab3c17ac_non-feature-ben-and-jerrys-free-coneday-HR.jpg", "http://www.benjerry.com/scoop-shops/free-cone-day/free-cone-day-flavor-quiz", "http://www.benjerry.com/ice-cream-near-me", "http://www.benjerry.com/scoop-shops/free-cone-day"], "published": "2017-03-28T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:31:19.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
