Ruling: Almighty Backstroke \nWay across the stage, talkin’ about “Miley, what’s good?”/ That’s Hannah Montana, she was always happy/ You only fronted on Mariah ‘cause Mariah don’t carry/ Tried to disrespect Taylor ‘cause Taylor wasn’t Swift enough \nRemy is basically saying: You can pretend to be hard with those bony white girls, but that shit will not work with me. Also, you’ve been beefing with pop stars . Not only does Mariah not carry, Mariah was probably sipping champagne and trying on stilettos while she engaged in their so-called feud . Ruling: Somebody \nYou fucked the whole empire who you tryna be, Cookie? \nPLEASE CHECK MY PULSE. Ruling: Check 10th Rebound \nAnd stop talkin’ numbers, you signed a 360 deal/ Through Young Money, through Cash Money, through Republic/ Which means your money go through five niggas before you touch it/ Any videos, promotions come out of your budget/ Endorsements, tour and merchandise, they finger-fuck it/ You make, like, 35 cents off of each ducat/ I own my masters, bitch, independent \nNicki has always prided herself on being a boss ass bitch and getting her money stacked, which is both fair and true—she’s worth an estimated $60 million. But this is just brutal . Advertisement Advertisement \nRemy clearly knows the only things Nicki can truly come back at her with are her album sales and her net worth—both of which trump Remy’s. But now, even knowing how rich Nicki is, any boasting will seem kinda hollow. Ruling: On 11th Inning Stretch \nBut you point your fingers at me? I’m the bad girl/ When she the one out here misleadin’ the black girls?/ All these fake asses influenced by that girl/ Dyin’ from botched surgeries—what a sad world! \nThe enormous fake butt trend is of course not all Nicki’s fault. But implicating her in all this isn’t... wrong. Ruling: Onika 12th Set \nAnd I got a few words for the moms of the young Barbz/ Guess who supports a child molester? Nicki Minaj/ You paid for your brother’s wedding? That’s hella foul/ How you spendin’ money to support a pedophile? \nRemy. Went. There. Advertisement \nLast April, Nicki’s brother Jelani Maraj was indicted for allegedly, “repeatedly” raping a 12 year-old girl. \nRemember when Remy said “I don’t play fair?” Ruling: Jesus Loop 13 \nYou just got bodied by a Love & Hip-Hop bitch \nSomehow I find this to be the rudest part of the entire song. Love & Hip Hop is entertaining and all but it really is a place for C-E list rappers/actresses/strippers/personalities to go for a safe check. Advertisement Advertisement \nWhat’s also clever is now, again, Nicki can’t really come back with a diss about her being on the show. Remy knows she’s on Love & Hip Hop and still whooped your ass. She basically pulled a reverse B-Rabbit on Nicki. Ruling: Christ! En Garde \nSoon after the song dropped, Nicki unwisely took to Instagram. \nHer first attempt tried to diffuse the massacre that had just taken place by pointing out the low sales of Remy’s latest album. I mean, alright. But girl. GIRL, DID YOU HEAR THE SONG? Advertisement \n(I should also note, I crafted that tweet before the full weight of the song hit me. I of course now believe that it should be seven minutes, and possibly longer. I still wish this wasn’t happening.) \nAt some point, she deleted the first post and replaced it with a clip of Beyoncé calling her the “rap queen.” \nHere’s the thing: Beyoncé is great and all, but I’m not sure she’s the co-sign you need right now. For starters, you know good and goddamn well Beyoncé isn’t going to say a word in your defense. As we all know, she sat back and watched her sister kick and scratch her husband—I don’t think she’s stepping up for you, boo! Advertisement Advertisement \nAlso, though Beyoncé is a connoisseur of rap and a solid rapper in her own right, what you need is one of the greatest rappers of all time to defend you—AKA Beyoncé’s husband Jay Z. \nBut oops, remember when Jay jumped on the remix of Remy Ma and Fat Joe’s hit song, “All The Way Up”? It would be pretty awkward for him to backtrack now. Plus you know Beyoncé won’t let him get into this mess. Final Ruling: You blew a 3-1 lead, lost to the Mighty Ducks then got knocked out by Muhammad Ali in his prime Post-Game Press Conference \nI mean MY GOD. Remy left bodies in the street. Not only did she not play fair, she was willing to rat out any damn body to make her point. There’s also the fact that Nicki sort of brought this upon herself. You should have kept your mouth shut, girl! You know you can’t out-rap Remy! How did you think this would end? Advertisement \nOf course, it’s not technically over—Nicki still hasn’t released a musical response to Remy, though I’m not sure she should. \nThis was a tough match because I do prefer a world where these women get along. Still, I have to give them props for producing a more entertaining rap beef than Drake and Meek Mill did with only one diss track. It’s truly the 2017 hip hop battle we deserve.
