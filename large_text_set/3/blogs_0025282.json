(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPresident Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago, according to a report from The Associated Press. Facebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar: \nRepublicans are crying crocodile tears as they bemoan “intelligence leaks.” The only reason they’re upset now is that clandestine Russian connections with campaign officials, Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort, they hoped to keep secret have been exposed. No harm to America’s national security, but Russian deals for some GOP elites might’ve been disturbed. President Trump loved WikiLeaks during the campaign, but now he’s concerned about how many of his lies will be exposed. \n— Michael Fetzer \nSo, what was the crime and where’s the proof? Nothing will come of this, because there was no wrongdoing. \n— Bud Rickett \nStill think there’s no Russia connection? Incompetent Trump may not have known it, but he definitely doesn’t surround himself with “the best people.” \n— Raffi Roupen \nAnd where’s the evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to influence the election, when will that be public? I’ll wait. \n— Bill Wilson \nComplete non-story. Every administration tries to make nice with Russia. President Obama and Hillary Clinton bent over backwards to play nice with the Russians. Businessmen and political operatives will work with whoever will pay their rate. What was illegal about Manafort’s business ties? \n— Chad Clausen \nLetter to the editor: \nIt’s time for Congress to do whatever it takes to investigate possible Russian ties to our new president. \nAmerican citizens need answers, and we want them now. It’s very easy for President Trump to say there are no ties and connections. But I am very skeptical of his claim when it pertains to Russia. A thorough investigation is vital and needed in this situation. \nJeff Swanson; Everett, Wash. Paul Manafort’s plan to ‘greatly benefit Putin government’ \nWe asked our followers their thoughts on reports about Paul Manafort having secretly worked with Russians, after affirming he didn't. Tweets are edited for clarity and grammar: \nJust one more card falling, as we watch this whole house of cards come crashing down. Get Manafort in any Russia-related intelligence hearings. \n— @ChuckWoodman \nI think we should stop talking about Moscow, Manafort and the 45th president as a political scandal. This is a full-on constitutional crisis. \n— @OldManChalmers \nI’m getting tired of the Trump administration (and campaign) lying to the American people. \n— @mle0729 \nNo surprised at all with Manafort. Just another Trump liar. \n— @grammaivi \nFor more, follow @USATOpinion and #tellusatoday .
