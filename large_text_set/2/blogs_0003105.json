We urge the Congolese people to come together and honor Tshisekedi’s memory by continuing to pursue his ideals of a peaceful and democratic Congo. \nTo that end, we call on all parties to the December 31, 2016 agreement and their supporters to work even more diligently towards its timely implementation and toward the country’s first democratic transfer of power. These achievements would be both a solid foundation for the DRC’s future and a lasting tribute to Etienne Tshisekedi’s legacy.
