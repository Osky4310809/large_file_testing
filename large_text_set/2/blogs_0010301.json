Read More Schools reaching 'breaking point' through combination of inflation, salaries and pensions \nMay putting on her, no doubt hideously expensive, sports gear to trample all over schools is a Tory Great Education Robbery which should have parents gathering at school gates to march on Downing Street. \nDestroying excellent schools on the altar of the failed ideology of austerity also involves diverting precious cash into pet projects such as grammars, despite no evidence they improve social mobility and the blanket hostility of heads in true blue bastions such as Surrey. \nOr punting so-called “free” schools which don’t automatically raise standards, while other experiments such as the £9million Greater Manchester University Technical College shut only three years since opening after none of its pupils passed English GCSE . \nSchools face drastic cuts in funding crisis worse than the NHS \nAcademies have proved better for the highly-paid education fatcats running them than the children attending them. \nOne head of a chain was on £400,000 – nearly three times the PM’s salary – and studies prove across the country there’s no guarantee of superior grades. \nIn some schools converted to academies, students do worse. \nMay hinted she’ll tinker with funding to try to buy off enough Tory rebels after early plans to force every school to become an academy ended in retreat. \nUnless the cuts are averted next it’ll be redundant teachers rushing to the JobCentre.
