Save SpaceX \nToday's SpaceX launch will be logged in the history books as the first time a flight-proven orbital class rocket has successfully been relaunched and returned to Earth. \"We just had an incredible day today,\" CEO Elon Musk said after the first stage Falcon 9 rocket made a clean landing \"right in the bullseye\" on the droneship Of Course I Still Love You. \"This is gonna be ultimately a huge revolution in spaceflight,\" Musk said. \"It's been 15 years to get to this point. I'm sort of at a loss for words. It's been a great day for SpaceX and space exploration as a whole.\" \nStage 1 of the Falcon 9 rocket that launched today was first used to boost a Dragon vehicle on a supply run to the International Space Station. The same rocket was also the first to successfully land on SpaceX's drone barge . The first stage represents about 80 percent of the cost of a rocket launch, so when Musk describes the next era in space exploration, he is referring to the new opportunities that will come with the significant cost savings.
