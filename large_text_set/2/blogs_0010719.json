He said it will shorten the travel time from Taytay to Bicutan to 30 minutes. King Rodriguez/Presidential Photo MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte’s communication team issued conflicting statements about his speech during his visit to earthquake survivors in Surigao City last Sunday. During the event, the president promised to release money for those who lost their loved ones and sources of living but did not say who would benefit from the assistance. He even asked his audience in jest if P2 billion is enough for them. The media then reported that the president is disbursing P2 billion to earthquake victims. Andanar, however, clarified on Tuesday that Duterte was referring to people who would lose their jobs because of the Environment department’s decision to close more than 20 mining firms who violated environmental laws. “I would like to clarify that. The president was saying that in the context of the mining. He said when mining firms are closed, people will lose jobs. Okay, people will lose jobs so he will give money, P2 billion,” he told radio station dzRH. But presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella maintained that the president was addressing survivors of the magnitude 6.7 earthquake. To explain what the president meant, Abella read parts of Duterte’s Bisaya speech and translated them to English. “I will translate literally: ‘I will release a little money, okay. So please use it carefully especially for those who lost their lives.’ Or it can also be translated as ‘those who lost properties and their lives,’” Abella said in a press briefing Tuesday. “‘Is two billion enough?... I don’t think you can finish that. I don’t think you can use all of that.’ And then he said again is in the same light-hearted manner, he said: ‘I don’t think you can use all of that.’ And then he said again in the same light-hearted manner, he said: ‘Bilhan ninyo na lang sila ng bahay sa subdivision (Buy them houses in the subdivision),’” he added. “The essence of the statement is not the two billion but that the essence of the statement is that he would release the monies and the funds to supply the needs of those affected by the earthquake victims.” Asked about Andanar’s claim that the president was referring to the miners who would be affected by the closure of mining firms, Abella said: “All right. Okay, let me just bring this back now to this statement—to his—to the primary source, okay. The primary source is PRRD (President Rodrigo Roa Duterte), and PRRD made the commitment to meet their needs, okay, to meet their needs.” “And the—in this sense, I understand where you’re coming from, that the figure is important. However, the collective intent of the president is to provide for all their needs,” he added. Abella clarified that while the president promised to help the quake survivors, he did not specify any amount. Pressed if he thinks Andanar, his superior, relayed wrong information to the media, Abella replied: “I am not saying that he relayed wrong information.” “Let’s just put it this way, let’s stick to what I’m saying now… I’m not saying that’s not true. I’m just saying that if you need further clarification on that part of the communication, you may refer to him (Andanar),” he added.
