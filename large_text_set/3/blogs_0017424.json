But we also need a feeling of security. Sort of like, building an exciting high building, but on secure foundations. But what does this mean in terms of how we live our lives. Maybe the foundations are financial security and a trusting and happy family life. Whether it's with or without spouses or kids. A home where we can feel safe, with no hassle and problems. \nAnd then on top of this we can build a skyscraper of action holidays, dangerous sports, ambitious work, risky careers, etc. So I think maybe the answer is to have a secure home life and a challenging work life. Or maybe, the reverse. An easy safe job that earns you a living and an exciting personal life. That could work. I think it might be too much, to have a crazy job and a crazy personal life. \nAlthough, if you're up to that then good luck to you. Or maybe you could have a mixture within both. Your home life could be secure but with some exciting holidays. And your work could be secure but with some exciting projects. Certainly, you don't want both work and home to be safe and boring. Laziness could cause this to happen, and in the short term it would be easy. But it would not be a satisfying way to live your life, in the long run. \nIf you think of it as a continuum, from bored through to enjoying and then on to achieving and then on to overstressed. Then happiness is to be found in the middle two. And it's your decision, whether you'd rather your life was mainly in the lower stress enjoying section or the higher stress achieving section. So in order to think about this, I'd like you to rate your work and your home life, for where they are from boring through secure, to enjoying and exciting all the way to stressful. \nAnd then see what kind of a mix you have. Clearly, if either work or home are too boring, or overstressed then that's a problem. But I would suggest additionally, that you don't want both to be safe but unexciting. And you might not want both to be exciting to the point where you have nowhere to just relax. So then you can think about what may need to be done. Can one of them be made more exciting? Or perhaps, does one of them need to be made more secure and less stressful? Can you get both your home and your work life, into this middle zone?
