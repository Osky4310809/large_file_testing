Yes, a sponge.\nIn 2012, Lori Greiner offered Scrub Daddy $200,000 for a 20% stake in the company. The smiling sponge has since sold over 10 million units, made more than $50 million in sales, and secured its title as the most successful \"Shark Tank\" product of all time.\nMade with a special FlexTexture material, the Scrub Daddy alters its texture and function as you change the water temperature.\nIf you need to wipe down your kitchen counters, dip the Scrub Daddy in warm water and it will take on the form and feel of a traditional sponge. When dampened with cold water, the versatile sponge will firm up, making it easy to clean deeper stains without scuffing up your surfaces. Using its unique shape, you can use the Scrub Daddy's smiling face to easily clean silverware or cups.\nUnlike most sponges you'd find at your grocery store, the Scrub Daddy is odor-free and washes off clean, so you won't have remnants of what you've cleaned all over it.\nWith over 2,000 reviews and a 4.5/5 rating on Amazon, the sponge has clearly lived up to its hype:\n\" I was a little skeptical of these 'self cleaning' sponges,'\" one commenter said. \"I use sponges regularly and they always get messy and difficult to work with. It was time to buy some new sponges so I figured I'd give these a try and see if they lived up to the hype. Sure enough, they did.\"\n\"Saw this product on 'Shark Tank' before it was popular,\" another said. \"I'm not big on gimmicks, but this sponge really works.\nOne more commenter summed it up by simply saying, \" I won't use anything but this Scrub Daddy from now on.\"\nWhether you use a sponge to clean your dishes or tidy up your apartment, the Scrub Daddy seems to be a worthwhile investment for your home.\nScrub Daddy Sponges, $15.70 for four\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
