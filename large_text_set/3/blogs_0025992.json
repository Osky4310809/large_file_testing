Smothering it over your beard ? You’re doing sparkly stuff all wrong.\nSeriously. That sort of glitter application is as 2016 as dickliner .\nIn 2017, the hot trend is rubbing glitter all over your rear.\nWhy you really shouldn't use a bath bomb as highlighter Yep. Glitter butt. It’s a thing, and you can expect to see it aaaall over Instagram as festival season approaches. Deal with it.\nThe trend is the creation of The Gypsy Shrine, a UK glitter shop who strongly believe in the power of throwing glitter all over your face and body.\nAs well as selling glitter, The Gypsy Shrine also pops up at festivals and parties to offer glitter application services, such as creating glitter packed partings, applying glittery face paint, and replacing t-shirts with glitter to cover your boobs.\nAnd the new look they’ve just added to their offering is the glitter bum.\n✨RAINBOW B TAY BY @thrillsoftomorrow ✨ EXCITING NEWS COMIN V SOON!!! #watchthisspace \nA post shared by THE GYPSY SHRINE (@thegypsyshrine) on Mar 16, 2017 at 9:50am PDT \nCosmopolitan reports that the trend was inspired by the feeling of sitting on the beach, standing up, and finding your bottom covered in sand. But instead of sand, now it’s glitter. Delightful.\nOf course, applying glitter to your own bum is a little tricky, so if you fancy trying the trend it’s probably best to leave it to a professional.\n✨WHAT A WEEKEND✨ BEYOND SAHARA YOU ARE AMAZING!!!
