Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than 3,800 companies are exhibiting at CES this year \nAbout 177,000 people are expected to take part in this year's show, which runs until Sunday. 'Short-sighted' \nThere are nearly five times as many French companies attending this year's CES as British ones. \nMr Shapiro said there had been an annual increase in numbers over the past few years thanks to Paris making greater effort to help its entrepreneurs. \n\"Now we're starting to see other countries take notice,\" the president of the Consumer Technology Association added. \n\"We've seen that the Netherlands and others going in there big time [this year]. \n\"Britain's been a little slow to the game honestly. We have a minister from Britain coming but there's not a lot of activity that we've seen at CES. \n\"I think it's a source of embarrassment. \n\"When I was in London recently, I raised it with one of the ministers, and they said: 'Yeah, it's amazing. I can get approval to go to [Texas festival] South by Southwest, but because it's Las Vegas, for some reason it's frowned upon.' \n\"And that's a pretty short-sighted attitude.\" Bespoke help \nCES charges a discounted rate for stands in its Eureka Park start-up zone. \nAt this year's show, there are French, Ukrainian, Czech, Saudi Arabian, Dutch, Israeli, New Zealand and US stands organised by government-backed agencies to promote local talent. \nBut a spokeswoman for the UK's Department for International Trade (DIT) said it thought it was more effective for UK attendees to base themselves elsewhere in product-themed areas.

Travel costs \nBut at least one UK start-up is dissatisfied.

Media caption Bluemint Labs will be promoting a sensor that lets smartphones be controlled with a wave of the hand \n\"The government provides the label La French Tech, which helps with branding,\" said its marketing manager Pavithra Govindarajan. \n\"This label helps get more exposure and adoption among the big retailers in France. \n\"The regional governments also play their part. \n\"For the region Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, the body Minalogic is supporting select start-ups by paying back some part of the travel and accommodation costs. It is also helping set up meetings with major brands, which otherwise would have been very tough.\" More than money \nMs Lane said Smarter Applications was spending about Â£40,000 on CES, and could only afford a private meeting room rather than a show floor stand. Image copyright Smarter Applications Image caption Isabella Lane says other European countries do more to support their start-ups \nShe acknowledged that there were grants available to the UK tech sector but added that they were difficult to qualify for. \n\"You have to fit very particular requirements, and as a hardware-software smart home start-up we didn't quite meet them,\" she explained. \nBut Mr Shapiro stressed he was not calling on the UK to subsidise its young companies' CES appearances. \n\"Government support is just not funding, I want to make that very clear,\" he explained. \n\"It's political leadership. It's showing up. \n\"It's a matter of [attracting] attention. We're having the prince of the Netherlands show up, for example. \n\"I don't know why the UK is not responding, because there is a tremendous amount of innovation there. \n\"I think there's a great opportunity for the UK, which is untapped.\" Country", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T02:21:56.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
