Everybody deserves arts, everybody deserves culture.”\nOver the past three years, the NEA has given $6.5 million to San Francisco arts organizations.\nRally organizers worked to show the role that federal and city funds play in supporting organizations both big, like YBCA, and small.\n\nSigns at the rally for arts funding Tuesday at San Francisco City Hall.

Theatre Bay Area Executive Director and Californians for the Arts Board Member Brad Erickson led the California delegation.\n\nIn a phone interview, Erickson said he expected support for cultural funding from Democrats. “But I think we’re seeing that there is also Republican support for the NEA,” he added, including from Representative Ken Calvert, who chairs the interior subcommittee which oversees arts funding. “Calvert is actually a very strong advocate of the NEA and other cultural endowments,” Erickson said.
