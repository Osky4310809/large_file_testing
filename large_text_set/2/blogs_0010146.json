It is understood that Mr Bercow has told friends and allies he wants to remain in post until at least 2020. \n“Bercow did this to win Labour, SNP and Lib Dem support for staying on,” a senior member of Theresa May’s Government said. “He has orchestrated the whole thing.” Bercow did this to win Labour, SNP and Lib Dem support for staying on Senior member of Theresa May’s Government \nA llies of Mr Bercow said that he had simply been responding to a point of order in Parliament by Stephen Doughty, a Labour MP, calling on officials to withhold permission for an address to Westminster Hall by Mr Trump. \nBut a number of Conservatives claim that Mr Bercow knew the question was coming and had pre-prepared his remarks. \nMr Bercow prompted a furious response from ministers on Monday when he told MPs: \"We value our relationship with the United States. However, as far as this place is concerned I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons. \n\"Before the imposition of the migrant ban I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall. After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.\" A number of Conservatives claim that Mr Bercow knew the question was coming and had pre-prepared his remarks Credit: Paul Grover for the Telegraph \nL ord Fowler, the Speaker of the Lords, expressed his anger after he was not consulted by Mr Bercow about his statement. He suggested that he and Mr Bercow should be stripped of their ability to \"effectively veto\" foreign leaders from addressing Parliament. \nAlec Shelbrooke, a Tory MP, on Friday voiced support for Mr Duddridge’s motion, saying that although Mr Trump’s “faith-based migrant ban” is “discriminatory” and “wrong”, Mr Bercow had “politicised the office of Speaker and his position is untenable”. \nHowever, Labour MPs defended Mr Bercow. \nKate Osamor said: “John Bercow has my full support & I won’t be voting for a motion of no confidence.” \nAnd Seema Malhotra, a former shadow minister, said: “Lots of support for Speaker Bercow who does his job with impeccable fairness and honesty.” \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has written to the Speaker to stress his support for him.
