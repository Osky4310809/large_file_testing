Details of the prophecies for 2017: Adeboye \nFOR NIGERIA The focal word for the year 2017 is surprises 1. 2017 will be a year of surprises.

The downward plunge will slow down, it will stop and a reversal will begin. \nINDIVIDUALS 1. It will be a year of surprises 2. For both true and false prophets it will be a year of surprises 3. There will be a large number of weddings. 3. Soul winners will see their prophecies fulfilled almost as soon as they are uttered. \nINTERNATIONAL 1. There will be surprises for many world governments. 2. They are coming in twos; Monster earthquakes, monster floods, monster hurricanes and typhoons, monster tornadoes, monster fire outbreaks” Earlier in his message titled: “Enforcing Prophecy”, the cleric warned Christians to flee from fake prophets whom, according to him, are only after what they will eat. On what to do for prophecies to be fulfilled, Pastor Adeboye told the worshippers to believe God, believe true prophets, appreciate God’s sovereignty, engage in fasting, prayer and avoid all sorts of distractions. \nIn his words: “Believe God because prophecies come from Him, no matter how unbelievable such prophecy sound, believe it. Believe the true prophets of God, not those who prophecy because of money or properties. Appreciate the fact that God is sovereign, He has the right to change His mind, the fire honor Him, stop robbing Him, make Him happy, win souls. Learn to fast, pray without season and put away all forms of distraction.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:32:06.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
