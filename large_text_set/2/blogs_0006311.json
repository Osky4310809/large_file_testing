Clary / AFP / Getty Images \nID: 10504905 A New York City museum that had been the site of an anti-Trump performance-art installation led by Shia LaBeouf announced Friday that it had shut down the exhibit, stating that it had become dangerous for visitors and residents.\nThe Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens said in a statement that the “He Will Not Divide Us” installation — which went live on Inauguration Day — had “become a flashpoint for violence and was disrupted from its original intent.”\nThe actor tweeted Friday, “The museum has abandoned us.”\n#HEWILLNOTDIVIDEUS\n— Shia LaBeouf (@thecampaignbook) ID: 10505185 LaBeouf invited people to chant the phrase “he will not divide us” repeatedly on camera for a video that organizers had originally planned to livestream throughout Trump’s presidency\n\nThe morning it launched, Jaden Smith kicked things off and stood there for hours repeating the phrase. The exhibit was open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nOn Jan. 26, LaBeouf was arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault and harassment after he punched and scratched the face of a 25-year-old who police said had also been protesting Trump.\nThe protest also saw other bouts of violence, including when LaBeouf shoved a man who said, “Hitler did nothing wrong” on camera.\nNeo-Nazi says \"Hitler did nothing wrong\" to Shia LaBeouf and got pushed.
