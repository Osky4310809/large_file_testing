He wants to be proper in these sort of games. \n\"If the lad’s like that, you can’t tell him he’s wrong, if that’s what he tries to do. \n“When you see it, he can’t miss from there, he was so close and after that Walker pushes him in the back.” \nCity boss Pep Guardiola has demanded a meeting with referees’ chief Mike Riley. \nGuardiola and Riley spoke after Christmas and there is an open dialogue between managers and the refs chief. \nThere is also, privately, an acceptance that Marriner got the decision wrong and should have awarded City a penalty. Yaya Toure was astonishing by ref Andre Marriner's decision (Photo: Getty) \nToure added: “For me, if video can be involved in football it is going to be brilliant. If the ref looks at the highlights as well he is going to feel something is unfair. We all do wrongs in life but this is difficult to take. \n“It is two points going away. We played against a good team. Tottenham are fantastic — they play well, they are strong, they fight for every ball. But we deserved three points. \n“Something has to be done. When you see the highlights on the game, I think you’ll see it was harsh. \n“When you see the two penalties, Raz (Sterling) is always in front and the guy’s pulled him, kicked him. it’s unfair sometimes. City also wanted a penalty for a Victor Wanyama challenge on Sterling (Photo: Getty) \n\"I’ll go home and watch the highlights and I’ll probably be angry, because we’ve lost two points like that. \n“If he [Marriner] looks again, he’ll see something was very wrong. It’s one point, we have to put our heads up and treat it as part of life and continue working.” \nThe Premier League have denied claims there was a problem with the communications system linking the referee, his assistants running the touchlines and the fourth official. poll loading Was Kyle Walker's push on Raheem Sterling a penalty? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:51:30.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
