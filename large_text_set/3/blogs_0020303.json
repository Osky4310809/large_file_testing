It might be that it’s worth putting a smile on your face… Then again, you could just tell them to fuck off.\nWhat about when you’re catcalled, if you walk past someone and they just shout “wheeyyyy” at you? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729707 JB: When I’m catcalled, you know, I’m just so used to it actually. It just breezes over me.\nWhat if someone parent-shames you and tries to tell you you’re a bad parent? View this image ›\nID: 10729716 View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729723 JB: Again, [ grimaces ] they’d probably be telling the truth. Yeah, they’d probably be telling the truth. I don’t want to talk about that.\nWhen someone calls you a one-hit wonder? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729740 JB: Well, anyone who tells me I’m a one-hit wonder is probably a none-hit wonder. So yeah, I’m not too fussed about it. I do say on my Twitter bio that one song is all you need.\nView this image ›\nTwitter: @JamesBlunt\nID: 10729551 What do you do if someone barges into you on the tube and they don’t say sorry? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729759 JB: Well, I think that’s just kind of London life, isn’t it? You expect to kind of be bumped into. I mean, I’m always there. I’m not apologising for what I’m doing. I’m normally just staring at other people’s girlfriends on the underground…and checking them out and that… Yeah… No one seems to arrest me.\nWhat if someone attacks your personal appearance? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729772 JB: Well, I’m not very tall anyway actually. So [people] do normally when they bump into me say, “Hey, you look just like James Blunt only smaller!” [ laughs ] So I’m pretty used to that.\nWhen someone gives you a backhanded compliment? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729791 JB: I get backhanded compliments quite a lot. I often get “Hey, yeah, I don’t like your music but I really like your tweets” and I have written “Thanks, I don’t like your face but thanks for the compliment.”\nWhen someone points out that your surname rhymes with cunt? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729800 View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729801 JB: I did actually change my name. My name is spelt B-L-O-U-N-T, and I was upset with people saying, “Hey Blount, you count” and I found it deeply offensive because I have no title, I’m not from aristocracy. So I changed it to Blunt. So I thought it would be…better.\nIf someone’s being moody at you for no reason at work, how should you react? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729810 JB: I’m a touring musician, so if they’re moody with me then I would have done something wrong. So I probably needed a bollocking. I have a great tour manager, and he does, he grips me when I… he’s like my mother…and father. So they’re probably right.\nWhen someone confuses you for the lead singer of Coldplay? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729821 JB: No one has ever thought I was the lead singer of Coldplay. Someone did come and ask me for an autograph thinking I was in Flight of the Conchords once. And I didn’t tell them that they got it wrong, I just did the autograph. [ smiles cheekily and laughs ] I was just thrilled that anyone was coming up and saying hi and asking for an autograph! It didn’t matter.\nWhen should you clap back and when should you ignore something if it’s tempting to shut them down? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729829 JB: I think if someone’s been rude to you online, I think it’s worth probably not doing it with any emotion. So if you need to take a few moments to have a breather… I think it’s always worth remembering that the person who is being rude to you online, the likelihood is, if they’re a stranger – unless it’s a friend if yours who is probably entirely right – but if it’s a stranger they probably are on their own at home in a darkened room with their trousers around their ankles and not worth taking seriously.\nWhat do you do if you’ve written a great Twitter clapback but you’ve accidentally put a typo in it? View this image ›\nBuzzFeed\nID: 10729836 JB: There is nothing more upsetting than doing a clapback with a typo or a grammatical error. I kick myself, and I’ve done them a few times. I think still to this day it’s something I lose sleep over.\nThanks, James!
