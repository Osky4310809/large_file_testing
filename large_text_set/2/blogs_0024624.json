That is true, for now. But although astronomers have yet to discover a twin of the Earth, they have found several close cousins.\nOn February 22nd a team of researchers led by Michaël Gillon, from the University of Liège, in Belgium, announced several more. As they outline in Nature , Dr Gillon's team believe that seven roughly Earth-sized worlds circle TRAPPIST-1, a tiny star that lies around 40 light years from Earth (the star's rather striking name refers to the TRAPPIST telescope, in Chile, which did much of the planet-hunting work). Several other solar systems have been found with Earth-like planets, but to find seven such worlds orbiting a single star is unprecedented.\nEven more intriguingly, the fourth, fifth and sixth of those planets lie within the star's habitable zone, where water on a planet's surface could exist as a liquid. Because liquid water is, on Earth at least, a sine qua non for life, planets in the habitable zones of their stars are considered the most promising targets for detecting signs of alien life. Indeed, the researchers point out that it is just about conceivable that some regions on the system’s innermost three planets might just be cool enough for water, too.\nThat is because TRAPPIST-1's planets are unlike Earth in one important way. Their proximity to their star means that all seven are thought to be tidally locked—in other words, their orbits and rotational periods are synchronised such that they always show the same face to their parent star, in the same way that the Moon does to the Earth. On an airless world, that would leave one side baking while the other froze, with perhaps a thin strip mild enough for water. On a planet with an atmosphere, the effects are less clear, though climatic models suggest it would cause a constant rush of wind from the hot side to the cool, helping to smooth out the temperature differences between the two hemispheres.\nWhether any of TRAPPIST-1's planets have atmospheres is, for now, an open question. But their relative proximity to Earth means it is a question that could be answered by powerful new telescopes due to start working in the next few years. The precise chemical compositions of such exoplanetary atmospheres could reveal clues about conditions on the surface—including, perhaps, hints of possible life. One such new instrument is the James Webb Space Telescope, the designated successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which is due to launch in 2018. TRAPPIST-1 will be high on its list of targets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:15:03.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
