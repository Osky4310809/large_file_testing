Why shouldn’t you? \nBut for some reason, dudes are surprised women can also judge them based on their looks? As if they’re the only ones who are capable of thinking with just their naughty bits? \nDudes are also surprised some women use a hookup app for the same reason they’re using a hookup app. \nAnyway, a user on a body building forum, GermanLifter , performed an experiment where he legit used photos of the model from Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe” music video, Holden Nowell. \nThis music video, if you don’t recall, has the hilarious twist of Holden wanting to get with Carly Rae’s guitarist instead of the singer… \nGermanLifter profile read, Body Building \nThe man catfishing these young women was surprised to find out women would often message him first, instead of vice versa. \nHe did admit he got turned down a few times because his opening messages were quite crass, which he seems to do on purpose to find out how, as he writes, “slooty” these girls are. \n(Side note: “Sluts” don’t exist. Women are allowed to have sex if they want to. Shocker, I know.) \nBut, ah, what it must be like to be beautiful! This dude is able to come up with the worst possible pickup lines and still land some numbers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:48:22.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
