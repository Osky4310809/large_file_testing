Sharma and Sunil Grover got into a fight on board a plane, where Sharma reportedly flung a shoe at him. Post that Sunil, Ali Asgar , and Chandan Prabhakar quit the show, while other comedians were roped in to fill up for them for the time being. One of them was A hsaan Qureshi , who did a special act on the show, sparking off rumours that he might soon become part of the cast. \nHe spoke about this and the Kapi-Sunil controversy with Indian Express , where he slammed Sunil for going back on the show after their previous fights. Here are excerpts. \nIf you don’t have the guts to speak because you think he won’t take you again, then that means he is your God. Then leave this nautanki. You are just keeping quiet, he will cajole you and you will be back on the show. Grow a spine. Being a comedian is different but being human is also important. He dented his image last time when he came back to him. What if Sunil’s show had worked and Kapil’s had flopped, would he have come? He came after he flopped. So, he is also selfish. He is not a saint. Why can’t you face the media and speak the truth? He just wrote a short message on Twitter. That’s it. He should speak more. But then I think, he will be back. \nHe further lashed out, \nBut this fight can’t be taken seriously because a similar fight happened earlier too. Sunil went and started his own show. It flopped and he was back on Comedy Nights with Kapil. If you were so firm on your stand, then why did you come back? Right now also, people are missing him but he should honour his word. People told us you don’t go on his show, I say I never begged Kapil to give me work. If you want to call us, it’s okay otherwise we have a lot of fans. And finally, he called us. Toh yeh hoti hai baat. He was insulted earlier too, but he forgave him and hence encouraged him. \nSpeaking of being part of the show, he added, \nIt’s not true. We were called as guests and this was our role. I don’t know why this rumour is being spread. It’s absolutely wrong. But yes, after such a long time for the first time, comedians were remembered on a comedy show, which has hosted everyone from film celebrities, child artistes to social activists, Anna Hazare, Ramdev, sportspeople. So, finally they thought of us and why they did, you all can understand. It is a case of damage control. \nOuch!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T09:12:02.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
