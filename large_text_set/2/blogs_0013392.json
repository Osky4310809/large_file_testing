Maybe he will have the chance to be on the bench or play from the start against Fulham. Fulham vs Tottenham: FA Cup preview \n“He was out of the squad against Gent and we cannot be sure if he will be in the squad, on the bench or start the game. Performance is always about how the players show their quality, their belief on the training ground. \n“When I select the starting XI and the bench, I try to be fair. It is normal that maybe he (Janssen) needs to show more.” \nNeither Janssen nor Georges-Kevin Nkoudou nor Moussa Sissoko appears to have the trust of Pochettino, despite Tottenham concluding deals worth a possible £60million to sign the trio last summer.

Vertonghen damaged his ankle in the 4-0 win over West Brom last month. \nPochettino added: “We wanted him to start working with the group on Friday and he has a chance for Sunday.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:20:02.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
