He's a fantastic player and character. It's a major blow for the lad, his club and us,\" the Ireland boss told Sky Sports . \n\"Apparently it wasn't the best challenge in the world – I haven't seen it. He's gone to hospital. I saw his reaction immediately and it didn't look good. He was holding is leg up and it didn't look good. Hope seamus Coleman gets better soon. Horrible tackle — Wayne Rooney (@WayneRooney) March 24, 2017 \n\"We had a few things to overcome this week. We have a really great spirit. \n\"Seamus is a major blow – at the end of it all the most important thing is Seamus' health.\" \nHorrific challange nah man get well soon seamus bro i know mentally he's the man to come back better stronger from this @Everton — Yannick Bolasie (@YannickBolasie) March 24, 2017 Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:55:44.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
