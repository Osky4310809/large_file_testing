Marroquin’s New Love Madison Arrested For Theft Court papers uncover 'Teen Mom' Kailyn Lowry's worst nightmare! Posted on Mar 22, 2017 @ 7:07AM \nJavi Marroquin has fallen for new love Madison Channing Walls despite her history of heroin use, but her dark past doesn’t end there. RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal The Real World: Skeletons star was once arrested. \nIn court documents obtained from Williamson County Clerk of Court, Channing Walls was arrested on May 24, 2013 for attempted theft. \nREAD THE COURT DOCS! \nThe MTV star was busted for “acquiring or otherwise exercising control over property, assorted cosmetics, of the value of $50 or more but less than $500 , from the stock and inventory of CVS pharmacy.” \nChanning Walls pled guilty to the misdemeanor. She was ordered to pay $220 in fines and court costs. \nBut her past bust may be the least of Kailyn Lowry’s worries, as Channing Walls opened up about her drug addiction while on The Real World: Skeletons . \n“I’m a recovering heroin addict,” Walls, 26, said on the show. “I am scarred for life from it. I just feel grateful to be alive.” \nOn one episode, Walls explained how she overdosed on more than one occasion from the drug. \nIn a 2014 interview with Chicago Sun Times , she revealed that she’s been sober for two years. \n“I did a lot of things that I’m not proud of,” she said. “But it’s okay because it made me who I am and it made me a better person overcoming all of that. It was a big self reflection for me.” \nWalls seems to have her life back on track, as she’s mother to 1-year-old daughter Harper with ex-boyfriend Tony Raines , who she met on the MTV series. \nMarroquin and Channing Walls went public with their relationship over the weekend. \nLowry, who shares son Lincoln, 3, with Marroquin, has yet to comment on the relationship. She is currently expecting her third child with her mystery baby daddy . \nShould Marroquin and Lowry be worried? Tell us in the comments. \nWe pay for juicy info!
