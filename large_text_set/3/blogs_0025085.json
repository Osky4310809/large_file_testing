Bush, Richard Painter, Says Alt-Right Websites Are Guilty of Treason Mar 23, 2017 7:48 PM 0 SHARES \nThe former ethics attorney for the idiot Bush made reference to an article which said the FBI was investigating 'right wing' websites -- who might've been complicit in helping the, err, Russians win the election for their agent -- Donald J. Trump. You've got to be kidding me with this shit. \nA little background on Mr. Painter. \nProfessor Richard W. Painter received his B.A., summa cum laude, in history from Harvard University and his J.D. from Yale University, where he was an editor of the Yale Journal on Regulation. Following law school, he clerked for Judge John T. Noonan Jr., of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and later practiced at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York City and Finn Dixon & Herling in Stamford, Connecticut. \nHe also writes for Huffington Post -- where he shills all day. \nHis Twitter feed reads like a disjointed Anti-Trump fanatic -- hedged by his role inside of the GW Bush administration. FBI uncovering evidence of treason. There is no other word for it. https://t.co/JLY7KZfQIY \nâ€” Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) March 23, 2017 \nDuring the campaign, Mr. Painter was an outspoken advocate for Hillary -- writing an oped piece in the NY Times saying she was the \"only qualified candidate in the race and she should become president.\" \n\"There is little if any evidence that federal ethics laws were broken by Mrs. Clinton or anyone working for her at the State Department in their dealings with the foundation.\" \nRight (wink, wink). \nIn short, the media, once again, have been caught trying to be duplicitous with their headlines -- painting Painter as a former republican distraught by presence of Donald Trump in the White House -- a conscience objector, when in fact he's nothing more than a life long liberal who happened to have a 2 year stint inside of GW's neocon heavy administration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:52:16.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
