It’s no surprise that Lenovo is preparing to launch the next generation of the Moto G series given the success it saw with the Moto G4 and the Moto G4 Plus. And if the listing is indeed correct, this year’s G5 Plus may be getting a major facelift and a minor hardware update.\nThe seller claims that the unit – by the model number XT1685 – has the following specs:\n5.5-inch FHD (1080p) display Snapdragon 625 processor (octa-core), Adreno 506 13MP rear camera. 5MP front camera 4GB RAM 32GB storage 3080mAh battery Fingerprint sensor Android 7.0 Nougat As you can see, compared to last year’s Plus model, we are seeing a slight bump in the processing department, and it looks like the 32GB configuration will come with 4GB of RAM, not 3GB this time around. It will reportedly run Android Nougat out of the box, but apart from these, not much seems to have changed in terms of specs. The design, however, is much more in line with Lenovo’s latest design language with the protruding circular camera panel on the back.\nWe couldn’t confirm the device’s official name at the time, and now it looks like the leaked CADs may have been renders of the Moto G5 Plus. \nNow, the leaked device looks almost identical to the renders we showed you a week ago. And it looks almost identical to the photos that have been circulating since early December , which were widely thought to be photos of a new Moto X device. We couldn’t confirm the device’s official name at the time, and now it looks like the leaked CADs may have been renders of the Moto G5 Plus. Again, although nothing can be confirmed until Lenovo officially takes the veil off this mysterious device, it looks like the company is getting closer and closer to it.
