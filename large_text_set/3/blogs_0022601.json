AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit \nBANGKOK â€” Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte met Tuesday with Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, completing a series of get-acquainted visits with the members of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which the Philippines is chairing this year. \nDuring Duterte's visit, the Philippines and Thailand signed agreements on cooperation in agriculture, tourism, and science and technology. \nIt was Duterte's second trip to Thailand since becoming president last year. He visited Bangkok last November to pay respects to Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died at age 88 after a 70-year reign. \nDuterte flew in Monday night from Myanmar, where he met with the country's top leader, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and other officials. \nOn Wednesday, Duterte is to hold a discussion with business executives and meet the Filipino community in Bangkok. There are about 16,000 Filipinos living and working in Thailand. Meetings with his overseas countrymen, who are among his biggest boosters, have become an important part of his trips abroad and help firm up his political support. \nHe is to return to Manila on Thursday.
