Dead fish in tanks are visible to the public eye, turtles have polystyrene for a floating device or none at all, rabbits & guinea pigs are kept together with too much hay, birds are crammed into tiny cages covered in fesses, puppies are not available for the public to see but it has been mentioned that they are also kept in small cages with nothing but a fan for 'fresh air' and kittens have been reported to have vommited up massive worms after purchase. As you have read, Levin Pet World is a breeding ground for animal abuse and neglect. The store itself is cluttered and unorganised. This place needs to be shut down for good!! All the animals in their care are suffering, and we are the voices that they all so desperately need. read petition letter â–¾ \nI have been made aware of the horrible, neglected conditions you keep your animals in. I wish to see Levin Pet World closed for good, and the animals sent to homes where they will be properly cared for & maintained. You should not value yourself as a reliable or safe pet store owner, you are allowing innocent animals to suffer and die at your hands. Please take this seriously. As a member of the public, we want your store closed down. \nPlease send this to: levinpetworld@windowslive.com . Or create your own letter, thankyou.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:02:58.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
