Literally everyone does,” Hickenlooper said, referring to a political action committee. “I haven’t formed a PAC. I’m not going to form a PAC.” \nThe speculation began earlier this month with a report based on anonymous sourcing from a newspaper that Trump’s White House began tracking potential rivals in 2020. The unsubstantiated list published by the New York Post included Hickenlooper’s name, even though he has pledged to not bash Trump . \nWhen CNN asked Hickenlooper on Monday about his interest in running for president, the governor played coy and said, “there’s going to be lots of things on the table.” \nIn Washington political parlance, it translates to Hickenlooper “won’t rule out 2020 bid,” as the CNN headline blared . \nAnd here’s the disconnect. For national media outlets not familiar with Hickenlooper, his words more accurately translate to the governor sidestepping the question. \nHickenlooper likes to go with life’s flow, as his memoir makes clear, and he often declines to take a hard-line stance on questions about his future. His “open mind” approach has generated plenty of trouble for him through the years and sent aides scrambling to clarify his political ambitions and his remarks about policies such as guns and taxes. \n“What I said to them,” Hickenlooper told The Post, “was there was a lot of other things on the table besides me (running for president). They took that to mean that one of those things was me running. I thought that couldn’t have been more clear that I wasn’t going to run.” \nHe added: “I (always) say the same thing: You never rule anything out.” \nHickenlooper did a similar verbal dance ahead of the 2016 election about his higher political ambitions, downplaying his interest and trying to keep all doors open . \nAnd it’s worth noting: He did want the VP job, despite his repeated suggestions otherwise. \nSo is he interested? He says no — for now. Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:00:51.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
