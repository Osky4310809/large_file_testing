It’s one of the core truths of humanity, right alongside “everybody poops” and “Han shot first.” However, it’s important to note that some mistakes are bigger than others, and also that some people say they made a mistake when they actually just got caught doing something stupid or evil. As the visionary behind the masterpiece of bullshit that is “alternative facts” and one of the biggest advocates for the victims of the Bowling Green Massacre , Kellyanne Conway knows a lot about mistakes (specifically the kind that aren’t really mistakes), and in a recent interview on CBS, she explained that her many mistakes are no different than the ones that other people make. \nOr at least that seems like the point she was going for, since most of Conway’s responses were pretty much nonsense. For example, CBS’ Norah O’Donnell asked her about the infamous “alternative facts” thing, and here’s how she explained it ( via Variety ): \nWell, it was alternative information and additional facts. And that got conflated. But, you know, respectfully, Norah, I see mistakes on TV every single day and people just brush them off. Everybody thinks it’s just so funny that the wrong—the wrong movie was, you know, heralded as the winner of the Oscars. \nNotice how she immediately tries to move away from the actual question by bringing up the Oscars, indicating that her “alternative facts” line was no different than Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway reading the wrong card, when in fact it was practically a thesis statement for a presidential administration that has effectively disavowed all actual facts in favor of garbage cooked up by “alt-right” websites like Breitbart or the darker corners of Reddit . Comparing her “mistakes” to the Oscars mix-up only makes sense if Beatty and Dunaway read the wrong card on purpose and hoped that nobody would ever notice. \nO’Donnell also asked Conway if she thought the “alternative facts” thing hurt her credibility, with Conway saying that “the question presumes that it did and so now you’ve got that in the ether,” which seems to be implying that nobody thought it hurt her credibility until just that very second. It’s like she’s bought into the Trump fantasy so hard that she truly thinks nothing bad is happening until you suggest that it is, which wills the bad thing into existence. \nLater on, O’Donnell asked about the Fatal Attraction -inspired Saturday Night Live sketch that saw Kate McKinnon’s Conway attacking Jake Tapper in an attempt to get on TV. In Conway’s universe, “people really got outraged at that particular skit,” and though she says a lot of people came to her “defense,” she wants to make it clear that “it was also untrue.” Just to make that clear, she wants everyone to stop feeling like they need to stick up for her, because the events depicted in that SNL sketch did not really happen. That is presumably a huge relief to the many Trump supporters who don’t understand how reality works, because you know you can always trust the woman who introduced us all to “alternative facts.” \nYou can see Conway’s interview below. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:41:14.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
