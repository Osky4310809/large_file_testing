Getty Images 0 11-Mar-2017 03:30:53 The Argentine is still negotiating a new deal with the current Spanish champions and could be set to land a major pay day to add to his fortune \nLionel Messi remains without an extension to his current Barcelona contract, which expires in 2018, and though there is not currently great concern he could leave Camp Nou next summer the clock is ticking. \nWhat is Ronaldo's net worth & salary? \nWherever the Argentine ends up - and there are, of course, plenty of clubs who would be willing to offer him significant financial incentives to quit Barca - he is in line to land a major pay day soon. \nBut exactly how much is Messi worth right now? While it's difficult to get an exact figure, we can accumulate plenty of information from what has been reported and compare his earnings to his Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo. What is Messi's salary? \nMessi is reportedly the third highest-paid player in Europe after Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. It is worth noting that both Real Madrid stars signed new contracts in 2016 whereas Messi's last upgrade came back in 2014, so it is not totally surprising that both have overtaken him. \nThe common account puts Messi's weekly salary at £336,000, about £30,000-a-week less than Ronaldo. Whether with Barca or elsewhere, Messi will at least be in line with his main Ballon d'Or foe and may even surpass him when he signs his next deal. \nIf Messi was to really shock world football and go to China, he could even bag more than Carlos Tevez's incredible £615,000 a week - but that seems hugely unlikely at this stage of his career and is unlikely to be on offer in Europe with Financial Fair Play rules to contend with. Oscar, on £400,000 weekly in China, is the only other player ahead of Ronaldo. What sponsorship deals does Messi have? \nMuch like Ronaldo , Messi's many sponsorship deals are too numerous to list in their entirety but the most significant is with the makers of his boots. Their rivalry continues in the battle between Nike (Ronaldo) and Adidas (Messi) off the pitch. \nA couple of months or so after Ronaldo signed a \"long-term\" deal with Nike that is rumoured to be similar to the lifetime agreement penned by basketball star LeBron James - and potentially worth $1 billion - Messi, lo and behold, did similar with Adidas. The exact terms were not disclosed, but reports in Spain suggest it will take him through at least until the end of his playing career. \nMessi has also been part of prominent campaigns with Pepsi, Gillette and Turkish Airlines. As part of their 2016 celebrity rich list, Forbes valued his endorsements at $28 million (£23m) for that year in total. What businesses does Messi have? \nPart of Messi's appeal, of course, is his image as a pure footballer who takes little interest in the lavish lifestyle available to him off the field. His apparent lack of desire to branch out into other ventures and create a personal brand has in some ways become a brand in itself, and is attractive to sponsors. \nBut while Messi does not push lines of underwear, shoes and fragrances like Ronaldo, he has invested in property. Around his birthplace of Rosario in Argentina, for example, he has put money into the Azahares del Parana project (a set of gated communities out of the city) as well as an apartment building in the city centre. \nThere's almost certainly much more than that, but - as tends to be the case with Messi - it is kept pretty private. What charity work does Messi do? \nAs is the case with his business interests, Messi's charity work is considerable but tends to be focused through sources and ventures he trusts. He has his own organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which recently announced it would be supporting the campaign to eradicate Hepatitis C. \nThe initiatives Messi backs are generally related to vulnerable children and their healthcare, and he was appointed an ambassador for Unicef in 2010 having worked with them since 2004. What is Messi's net worth? \nMessi's net worth is estimated to be between £200m and £230m, and probably comes in a touch lower than Ronaldo's. These figures are speculative, though, especially as the 30-year-old's business interests tend not to be widely publicised. \nForbes ranked Messi second among athletes on their list of the 100 highest-earning celebrities of 2016, putting his income for the year at $81.5m (£67m), and eighth overall. He was $6.5m behind Ronaldo and some $44m ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was the next footballer on the list.
