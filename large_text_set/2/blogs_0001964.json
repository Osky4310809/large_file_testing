That said, I think this speaker at a Seattle anti-Trump rally over the weekend really is representative of a certain fringe on the left. Certainly the crowd of several dozen people listening to this rant seems pretty enthusiastic about much of it.\nThe speaker, who is wearing a Black Lives Matter sweatshirt, isn’t identified by name but says at one point, “I am a pre-school teacher who is going to f**king radicalize mother-f**king four year olds and five year olds.” This brings a huge cheer from the crowd.\nAfter opening the rant with, “F**k white supremacy. F**k the U.S. empire” the speaker attacks capitalism. “You know what America thrives off of? Capitalism,” the speaker says, adding, “We use our mother=f**king, f**king black and brown bodies to live and survive while white people own f**king properties after that.” But the speaker has a solution for this problem, “So you know what we need to do? We need to start giving f**king money.” The rant continues, “White people, give your f**king money, your f**king house, your f**king property, we need it f**king all. You need to reparate black and indigenous people right now.”\nA minute or so later, the speaker takes it up a notch saying, “And we need to stark killing people. First off, we need to start killing the White House. The White House must die.” After rambling on a bit more the speaker returns to capitalism. “Capitalism is what…is f**king racism.” The speaker then goes on a tangent about organic food and demands that white people grow the organic food and bring it to the “black and brown community so we can have health food s**t too.”\nAgain, I don’t think this is representative of everyone marching against Trump, but stuff like this has a lot more appeal on the left than they like to admit. This is the kind of eliminationist rhetoric that would have been big news if it had taken place at a Tea Party event a few years ago.\nThis video is one of several shot by Hassan Abdi Sunday. His original clip is here . Finally, a hat tip to the Daily Caller which posted a clip of this epic rant yesterday.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:15:31.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
