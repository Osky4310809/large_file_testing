I was really in love with this dance — the steps,” said Bolton, 29. “It’s a lot like the dance I come from — the Texas two-step — and I’d like to dedicate it to my uncle, who’s in a wheelchair from a bad horse accident last year.”\n“I know if he could, he’d be slow-dancing with his wife Vicki right now,” said Bolton.\nTo show their support of Bolton, the bull rider’s family was in the audience cheering him on, including his grandmother, who could be seen wiping away tears from her eyes.\nThe pair was awarded a 29/40 from the judges.\nDancing with the Stars airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:35:43.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
