You basically collect a menagerie of cats and photos of said cats by attracting them to your humble abode with different houses, treats, and toys.\nThere’s a live-action movie in the works thanks to Japan (of course) and the latest trailer gives us a glimpse at more of who and what we can expect to see from the film. The cast will include Tomoro Taguchi from the live-action version of Gantz as the heroine Michiru’s senior editor, Tae Kimura from the Densha Otoko TV series as pet shopkeeper Yoko, Kayoko Okubo as an odd real estate agent, as well as various other actors making appearances.\nThe storyline’s pretty different from the actual game, however. The original game didn’t really have a story, but one had to be penned to make sure this could come to fruition. It follows novelist Sakumoto, who’s just won a new writer award and has transformed into a best-selling author. But after coming down with a bad case of writer’s block, he moves to a new home. At his new home, a cat shows up but keeps coming back each day after Sakumoto starts putting out food for the cat, much like you do in the mobile app Neko Atsume . Adorable.\nThe movie is planned for release on April 8, 2017, and will screen in select theaters in Japan. There’s yet to be any news of a worldwide release just yet, but given the popularity of the app itself, it just might make a splash overseas somehow. It’ll be interesting to see how this actually shakes out since you wouldn’t think of this property as anything that would move ticket sales, but hey — stranger things have happened.\nView as: One Page Slides 1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:43:07.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
