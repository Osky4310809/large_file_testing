Rhino Lightning arrived at the Humane Society of Utah after his family made the heart-wrenching decision to give him up. The child who wrote the long letter filled it with details about the dog that would be helpful for Rhino’s new family. \n“He was my puppy. I really hope he is in a good environment. I really miss him. I wish he knew that he was a pretty puppy,” the child wrote. The note further explained that Rhino is a “striped dream” who “hates snow & swimming,” but he “loves to run around” and to sleep under the blankets. \nUnfortunately, the family gave up Rhino because it has several small children and Rhino turned out to be too big and rambunctious for their family. They adopted the 3-year-old dog five months ago, and had picked up from the shelter, and returned to the shelter to help him find another family. \n“He gets a little excitable, and a little nippy,” Carrie Glagin with the Humane Society said. “It may not be best for a household with kids under 8.” \n“It’s the first time that a child has done this,” Deann Shephard, with the Humane Society of Utah told Today.com . “It was very heartbreaking to see from [her] perspective, [her] relationship and friendship with this dog, but we hope that she sees the story and knows that [her] best friend is going to find a new home.” Humane Society of Utah \nThe Humane Society further wrote on Facebook , “Please remember, surrendering a pet is never an easy decision. But, they are doing what is in the best interest of the pet. If they feel that they are not the best fit to provide what the pet needs, they entrust us to care for their pet and find a home that is a better fit.” \nThe shelter shared this video with hopes that potential adopters will want to meet him. \n“He is a really amazing puppy,” the child writes. “Rhino needs lots of attention and loves people.” \nWithin a few days of news breaking about Rhino has found a new home. “We have some great news! Rhino Lightning was adopted this afternoon and will join a canine sibling in his new home. We want to thank everyone who shared his story and helped us keep a promise to a very special kid,” the shelter writes. \nI have a feeling the new family will respect the kid’s requests – let him keep his full name –“Rhino Lightning” followed by the family name – don’t give him too many tennis balls (he quickly destroys them) and make sure he gets a bath at least once a month.
