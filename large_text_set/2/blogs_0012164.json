Haters say it’s a holiday created by Hallmark to sell greeting cards, and many guys begrudgingly get their partners gifts more out of obligation than love. But here’s one Valentine’s story that will genuinely make you feel all warm and fuzzy today: A Hungarian Jewish Auschwitz survivor is celebrating her 71st Valentine’s Day with the Scottish soldier who helped save her , according to The Daily Mail . \nJohn Mckay, 96, was part of a team that rescued Jewish prisoners from their Nazi guards in Poland in 1944. The prisoners, including 20-year-old Edith Steiner, were being marched to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany to face execution. Later, at a dance to celebrate the prisoners’ liberation, Mckay mustered up the courage to ask Steiner (now 92) to dance, kickstarting a relationship that culminated in their wedding in July 1946. The two worked as hoteliers in Scotland and had two children, seven grandchildren, and five great-grand-children before retiring to live at a senior care home.
