It will certainly allow Leicester to approach a higher calibre of coach, even though City may get only one more game in Europe. However, the board must be extremely careful not to employ someone that isn't prepared to drop down to the Championship should the worst-case scenario occur. Roberto Mancini arguably falls into this category, which is concerning since the Italian is currently favourite to take charge. \nChants of \"dilly ding, dilly dong\" are likely to reverberate around the King Power Stadium as fans vent their disgust at Ranieri's departure. His absence, however, can't be allowed to overshadow a vital game. Leicester need at least a point and even that could see them fall into the bottom three. \nThe last time the sides met at the King Power Stadium Leicester won 2-0 and Jamie Vardy scored a wonder-goal that even Reds boss Jurgen Klopp applauded. Vardy needs another performance akin to the one that day and hopefully his goal at Sevilla can help boost his confidence. Jamie Vardy scored a wonder goal against Liverpool the last time these sides met at the King Power. \nThe problem will be shutting Liverpool out, though. City lost the corresponding fixture 4-1 and Wes Morgan and Robert Huth don't look like keeping a clean sheet at the moment. Couple that with no Premier League goals in 2017 and it's hard to see Leicester getting a result. \nWhatever the scoreline, though, one thing will be pretty readily apparent: whether the players adopt a different mentality and level of fight. If that's the case it will fuel the theory Ranieri had lost the dressing room, something caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare has vociferously denied. \nThere's a fair chance, too, City's new manager will be watching from the stands. What would be more surprising than just sacking Ranieri would be doing so without a replacement already lined up. There will be a number of people on Mancini watch therefore. Alan Pardew, Gary Rowett and even Martin O'Neill have also been linked with the role. \nLeicester must forget about Ranieri's departure and just focus on causing an upset, like when they thrashed Manchester City 4-2 in December. They must put in the same level of commitment as the second half in Seville and remind themselves that the situation isn't as dire as it is being made out to be. \nUnlike under Nigel Pearson in 2014-2015, City aren't in the relegation zone and never were under Ranieri unless you count the early kickoff opening day loss at Hull City. Whatever happens against Liverpool, Leicester have a colossal and very winnable home game against the Tigers on the horizon. Win that and there just might be a little breathing space again. \nThere is clearly an air of doom and gloom around the club at the moment, and Liverpool will look to take advantage of that. But Leicester must begin life without Ranieri with players looking to prove a point and shine for the new manager who perhaps won't be as loyal to them as the genial Italian was. \nBen Jacobs is ESPN FC's Leicester City blogger.
