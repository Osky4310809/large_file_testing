curled a 90th minute equaliser to earn the Catalan side a point following Nicola Sanson's opener for the hosts \nLionel Messi rescued a point for Barcelona with a late free-kick in a 1-1 draw at Villarreal on Sunday, although the Catalans' failure to win dealt their pursuit of LaLiga leaders Real Madrid a further blow. \nBarca got 2017 off to a losing start thanks to a 2-1 Copa del Rey defeat to Athletic Bilbao and they were unable to chalk up their first win of the year at the renamed Estadio de la Ceramica. \nDespite dominating possession in the opening period, Barca reached half-time with the scoreline goalless for the fifth time in six league matches. \nAnd Nicola Sansone scored the game's opening goal after 49 minutes, capping a rapid Villarreal counter-attack. \nA trio of penalty appeals – two for Barca and one for Villarreal – were ignored before a free-kick on the edge of the box opened the door for Messi to snatch a share of the spoils. \nAnd the Argentina international, who had earlier hit the post, wrong-footed goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo as he fired into the top left-hand corner. \nVillarreal's Jaume Costa was sent off in stoppage time for a second yellow card as their hopes of entering the Champions League qualification spots were scuppered. \nThe result leaves third-placed Barcelona five points adrift of Madrid, who have a game in hand. \nIvan Rakitic was absent from the Barcelona squad amid rumours of interest from Manchester City, although the club earlier insisted the Croatian's omission was for \"technical reasons\". \nAndres Iniesta drew a save from Asenjo with a long-range strike inside the opening three minutes, before Neymar and Luis Suarez both went close. \nJonathan dos Santos' volley just over was a reminder of Villarreal's qualities at the other end, and Sansone subsequently forced Marc-Andre ter Stegen into two saves. \nNeymar then arrowed a right-footed strike just wide from 20 yards, having impressively forced open a space to get the shot away. \nVillarreal were reliant on the strength of their counter-attacking skills as Barca dominated possession, and a Messi header and low Suarez drive called Asenjo into action before the interval. \nIt was a dangerous break that led to the hosts' opener. \nRoberto Soriano intercepted a loose Barca pass before Alexandre Pato surged downfield and played in Sansone, who sent a low strike across Ter Stegen and just inside the left-hand post. \nNeymar came close to an instant reply when he was denied from close range by Asenjo after a well-worked free-kick, before Messi saw an effort agonisingly come back off the inside of the post with the goalkeeper beaten. 11 - Barcelona have hit the woodwork more often than any other side in La Liga this season.
