Benett/Dave Benett/WireImage Source: Getty Images \nThe Can’t Get You Out of My Head singer suspected the British actor of cheating on her and has now removed her “beloved” engagement ring. \nPals say she is inconsolable at the split — days after she vowed to drop her Minogue surname and become Kylie Sasse when they married. \n“She is absolutely devastated, totally heartbroken,” The source told The Sun. \n“She really believed he was The One. But she no longer trusts him.” \nSasse is said to have bonded with Marta while filming US TV drama No Tomorrow last year in Vancouver, Canada. \nA source who worked on the show, which has since been axed, revealed: “It is well known that Joshua and Marta had been close for a number of months.” \nMinogue is said to have had a series of rows with him before travelling to Paris Fashion Week two weeks ago with her best friend, photographer Katerina Jebb.

But he did leave,” the source said. \n“The reality is this situation had been bubbling under for a little while. She tried to make it work.” \nNews Corp Australia has reached out to Kylie’s team for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:14:54.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
