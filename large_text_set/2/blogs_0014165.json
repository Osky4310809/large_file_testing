Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., broke ranks with fellow Democrats to support Pruitt while Sen. Susan Collins, R-Me., left the GOP majority to vote against Pruitt.

Democrats have opposed Pruitt for his record of suing the EPA while he was Oklahoma’s attorney general, and for being a skeptic on the impacts of climate change. \nDemocrats insisted that documents a judge ordered released relating to Pruitt’s tenure as Oklahoma attorney general should be examined before the vote takes place. \nHowever on Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declared “enough is enough” and moved forward with the vote.   \nConfirming Trump’s Cabinet has taken the “longest” amount of time “since George Washington,” he chided. \n“Democrats’ obstruction has just kept many of our nation’s most critical agencies without a leader for too long — needlessly delaying the president from fully standing up this new administration,” he said. \nRepublicans said Pruitt is the man to reconfigure the EPA and rein in its power.

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska. \n“Millions of Americans, including some of my constituents in Alaska, have come to fear their own federal government. He is exactly the right person with the right qualifications and the right emphasis to fix this problem,” Sullivan said. \nAs the EPA gets a new leader, it will also get a new set of marching orders. \nPresident Donald Trump is set to sign several executive orders next week that will change the way the EPA operates. \nThe exact content of the orders could not be learned Friday, but CNBC and the New York Times said they would likely seek to undo climate change policies crafted by the Obama administration. \nThe Senate is on recess next week , but when it returns it will vote on four nominees — Wilbur Ross to lead the Commerce Department; Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mt., to lead the Interior Department, Ben Carson to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to lead the Energy Department.
