Also notable is bitcoin's highest-ever single exchange listing of $1,242, observed on the now-defunct exchange Mt Gox. \nYet, bitcoin prices have faced resistance as they have approached both historic benchmarks. \nIn the last 24 hours, more than 52% of BTC/USD orders on Bitfinex have been buy orders, according to BFXdata, though sell orders had mounted in yesterday's sessions . \nStill, developments could lie ahead. \nAs of 4:15 UTC, buy orders accounted for 77% of all trades on Bitfinex, suggesting upward pressure could be poised to mount. \nImage via CoinDesk BPI; Sad dog image via Shutterstock", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T07:31:21.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
