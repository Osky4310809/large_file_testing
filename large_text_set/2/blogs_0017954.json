Mattis Announces U.S. Military Will Not Collaborate with Russian Forces \nSo, what is it exactly about McMaster that led Trump to choose him as Flynn’s replacement? \nHere are just a few of the reasons why the 54-year-old general should prove to be a valuable asset in the role. \n1) Question the status quo \nArguably, McMaster’s biggest claim to fame is the book he wrote in 1997 while earning his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina titled “Dereliction of Duty,” in which he harshly criticized the Vietnam War-era military leadership for not sufficiently challenging the civilian leadership regarding the failing strategies that were being employed in the ultimately futile effort to rid the southeast Asian nation of communism.

David Barno of McMaster when he was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2014, adding that he is “the rarest of soldiers — one who repeatedly bucked the system and survived to join its senior ranks.” \n2) Experience \nMcMaster graduated from the West Point Military Academy and has served admirably and with distinction throughout his career. He commanded a troop of tanks for the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in the Persian Gulf War in 1991, served as special assistant to Gen. David Petraeus during the successful “surge” of troops in the Iraq War in 2007, and deployed to Afghanistan to oversee anti-corruption efforts in 2010. \nThe general is highly decorated for his service, having earned the Purple Heart, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star and Joint Service Commendation Medal, not to mention service medals from the campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq and the broader global war on terror, as well as the NATO Medal of Freedom and the Kuwait Liberation Medal from both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. \n3) Understands the current challenges \nMcMaster’s eyes are fully open to the reality of our nation’s current diminished military capabilities, though he is not one to grant that reality as being acceptable. Not even a year ago, McMaster testified before the Senate regarding the potential that the Army was “out-ranged and outgunned” by our global adversaries, and that the reduced size of the military placed U.S. forces at risk of being incapable of effectively defending the nation from the threats we face.
