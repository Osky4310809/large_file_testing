Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nNew mums have opened up with searing honesty about the affects of childbirth on their vaginas. \nThis video shows vloggers discussing how their nether regions \"took a pounding\" during labour and changed their sex lives as a result. \nSome of the women discuss how their pelvic floors collapsed and resulted in health problems and confidence issues. \nBut many found a solution by performing pelvic floor exercises and postnatal fitness instructor Emma Fullwood explains how these should be done. \nThe video for Channel Mum starts with blogger Lisa Lumley telling viewers: \"Everyone that has been pregnant has got some sort of change in the nether regions. \n\"But everyone is too scared to talk about it. I think they are worried this is (sic) only one it happens to.\" Read More Stunning 550-year-old mansion sells for almost half original Â£5millon asking price after failing to sell for FIVE years Vlogger Charlie who has spoken about the affects of childbirth on her vagina (Photo: Channel Mum / SWNS.com) \nThe women discuss how the only support new mums get for pelvis floor conditions is when their midwife asks them a brief question at the six-week check-up. \nMum-of-one Charlie O'Brien tells how she was hit by the sensation of her pelvic floor collapsing while in the supermarket. \nShe said: \"I vividly remember standing in the frozen vegetable aisle and feeling the sensation like I had prolapsed, like my pelvis floor, my internal organs, I don't know what, had fallen out of me. \n\"I got home and I looked in the mirror - down there, because I wanted to know what was going on. And I could see things weren't right. \n\"I was terrified so I started Googling it, of course.\" Emma and Natasha also tell of the affects childbirth had on their bodies (Photo: Channel Mum / SWNS.com) \nBut Charlie, who gave birth to son Noah in February 2015, says that was the worst thing to do. \n\"It's terrifying and you see some pictures you can never un-see,\" she said. \"But the chances are that has not happened to you. \n\"But the one good thing I did get from Google was the most important thing is to do your pelvic floor exercises.\" \nCharlie started doing the exercises \"like 20 times a day\" and within a few weeks she had seen a huge difference. \nMum-of-two Jess Ashe told how she was left unable to laugh or sneeze without having \"an accident\". Vlogger Lisa is another who spoke with searing honesty (Photo: Channel Mum / SWNS.com) \n\"After having Sophie I noticed the small things like sneezing, coughing - I'd have to go 'oh' and cross my legs. \n\"It eventually got worse where I couldn't jump, laugh, run, work out or go on the trampoline with the kids without having an accident. \n\"I actually felt really, really embarrassed about it.\" \nShe went to her GP and was prescribed eight weeks of pelvic floor physiotherapy. \nThe ladies discuss the various aids that can be used to assist in the exercises - including 'vagina eggs'. \nEmma Fulwood describes how to correctly perform a pelvic floor exercise by imagining holding an apricot inside the vagina. \n\"You've got to include it in your everyday activity,\" she said. \"It's like anything you try to train - you have to work at it.\" \nCathy Ranson, editor of ChannelMum.com, said: \"Thanks to Live Labour Vlogs and TV shows like One Born Every Minute, we all know what happens in the delivery ward - but what happens to your body afterwards is still kept hidden. \n\"Problems down there are very common, but are still shrouded in secrecy. If it's happened to you, you are not alone. \n\"We hope this video starts to smash the taboo and gets mums talking openly.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:33:57.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
