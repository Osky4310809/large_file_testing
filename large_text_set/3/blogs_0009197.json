PRINCIELO TUDIO VUELBAN, File \n  Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa will face the House of Representatives tomorrow to explain the government’s renewed and less deadly war against drugs, a House official said yesterday. \nRetired police general and now Antipolo City Rep. Romeo Acop, chairman of the House committee on public order and safety, said Misamis Occidental Rep. Henry Oaminal would move to subpoena Dela Rosa if he would not attend the hearing of the panel on the matter. \n“But he (Dela Rosa) already confirmed his attendance to me over the phone,” Acop said. \nLawmakers want to be reassured that President Duterte’s “Oplan Double Barrel, Reloaded” or the second part of the government’s anti-drug campaign, will be bloodless and at the same time eliminate rogue police officers. \nAcop said Oaminal sought Dela Rosa’s presence because they would like to know how the new strategy would work. \nDuterte abolished the PNP’s anti-drug unit and relieved the police of drug operations early this year following confirmed reports that rogue policemen were involved in the kidnap-slaying of Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo in October of last year.
