It requested for estimates for terminating leases and “property disposal.” \nThe Office of Management and Budget outline for Commerce for fiscal year 2018 proposed sharp reductions in specific areas within NOAA, such as spending on education, grants, and research. NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research would lose $126 million, or 26 percent, of the funds it has under the current budget. Its satellite data division would lose $513 million, or 22 percent, of its current funding under the proposal. \nThe National Marine Fisheries Service and National Weather Service would be fortunate by comparison, suffering only 5 percent cuts. \nThe figures are part of OMB’s “passback” document, a key part of the annual budget process in which the White House instructs agencies to draw up detailed budgets for submission to Congress. The numbers often change during the course of negotiations both between the agency and the White House as well as lawmakers and the administration later on. The 2018 fiscal year starts Oct. 1. \nA spokesperson for Commerce declined to comment. A White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the process was “evolving” and cautioned against specific numbers. The official would not respond to questions about the four-page passback document. \nThe biggest single cut comes from NOAA’s satellite division, known as the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service, which includes a key repository of climate and environmental information, the National Centers for Environmental Information. Researchers there were behind a recent study suggesting that there has been no recent slowdown in the rate of climate change — research that drew the ire of Republicans in Congress. \nAnother proposed cut would eliminate a $73 million program called Sea Grant, which supports coastal research conducted through 33 university programs across the country. That includes institutions in many swing states that went for President Trump, such as the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Michigan, Ohio State University, the University of Florida, and North Carolina State University. \nOn March 1 after his confirmation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that drawing up a budget would be a top priority. “One of the first steps,” he said “will be securing adequate appropriations from the Congress. In a period of budgetary constraint, that will be a major challenge.” \nThe OMB passback document said that Commerce, like other agencies, should “buy and manage like a business.” It urged the department to explore greater use of privately-owned commercial satellites and commercial cloud services while submitting to OMB a plan to retire or replace “at least one high priority legacy IT system” beginning in 2018. \nMany scientists warned that the deep cuts at NOAA could hurt safety as well as academic programs. \nConrad Lautenbacher, a retired vice admiral who was the NOAA Administrator under President George W. Bush, said “I think the cuts are ill-timed given the needs of society, economy and the military.” He added, “It will be very hard for NOAA to manage and maintain the kind of services the country requires” with the proposed cuts. \nJane Lubchenco, NOAA administrator under President Barack Obama, said that 90 percent of the information for weather forecasts comes from satellites. “Cutting NOAA’s satellite budget will compromise NOAA’s mission of keeping Americans safe from extreme weather and providing forecasts that allow businesses and citizens to make smart plans.” \n“NOAA’s research and operations, including satellite data management, support critical safety needs. A reduced investment now would virtually guarantee jeopardizing the safety of the American public,” said Rick Spinrad, a former chief scientist for NOAA. \nHe said weather warnings for tornadoes and hurricanes could be compromised. Navigational capacity used to help guide commercial ships and other mariners would suffer, leaving them without the “improved forecasts they need to safely maneuver coastal waters.” It could become harder to warn of tsunamis and forecast weather that will cause power outages. \nThe OMB passback said that the administration wanted to “prioritize rebuilding the military” and would seek “savings and efficiencies to keep the Nation on a responsible fiscal path.” It said that its proposed funding cut for the Commerce Department “highlights the tradeoffs and choices inherent in pursuing these goals.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:15:14.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
