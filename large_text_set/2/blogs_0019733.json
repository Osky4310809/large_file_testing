TNN | Feb 22, 2017, 09.13 AM IST Ranbir Kapoor is truly going the extra mile for the Sanjay Dutt biopic, which is being directed by Rajkumar Hirani . Over the last few months, the actor has been working out rigorously to beef up for the role, in his bid to resemble Sanjay Dutt. Now, we hear, Ranbir has even ditched his swanky set of wheels and travels by ferry to the sets of the biopic. Turns out, the film is currently being shot at Madh Island in Mumbai. The shooting location is a good two-hour-plus drive for both Ranbir and director Hirani from their respective residences. The two decided to cut down on this long travel by opting for the ferry instead. According to reports, Ranbir, Hirani and the entire crew takes the ferry service from Versova jetty as it saves them hours of daily commute by road. Naturally, at first, people using the public transport were thrilled to see the 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' actor travelling with them, but now they are reportedly used to Ranbir and the crew's presence.
