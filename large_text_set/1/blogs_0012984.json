The “exclusive refinement program” also includes the company’s Monoblock wheels, suspension solutions and interior customisation options. \nThe new E-Class comes with two bumper designs, and both get the Brabus treatment here. Exclusive and Avantgarde cars get a front spoiler, which brings a distinctive face and reduces lift on the front axle, the tuner claims. There are also surrounds for the side air intakes and a Brabus rear bumper insert with a diffuser look. Cutouts at each end allow the quad exhausts to peek out. The rear spoiler on the trunk lid fits all models. \nFor the AMG Line sedan, Brabus’ front spoiler attaches to the lower part of the factory bumper. The outer sections of the component are shaped like flaps for an even more dynamic appearance. Vertical surrounds for the outer air intakes also add a dash of sporty. The rear diffuser has three vertical fins to further optimise airflow. Monoblock wheels range from 18 to 21 inches. \nFor those looking beyond cosmetics, Bottrop is making available sport springs that lower the ride height by 30 mm. There’s also a special control module for models equipped with Air Body Control air suspension to match the conversion to high-performance tyres. \nLastly, power. Let’s start from the E 200 , which gets PowerXtra B20 tuning. The plug-and-play module boosts the entry four-cylinder turbo’s output to 225 hp and 330 Nm, from 184 hp/300 Nm. The base E 220d’s PowerXtra D3 module raises output by 27 hp and 50 Nm, while the D6 S kit for the E 350d boosts things by 51 hp and 100 Nm. This translates to a new peak torque of 720 Nm, available from 1,600 to 2,400 rpm. Thus equipped, it does 0-100 km/h in just 5.7 seconds. \nThe tuner’s sport exhausts with four chrome-plated pipes are available for all variants. There’s also a variant with actively controlled exhaust flaps for the E 43, which allow altering the exhaust note at the touch of a button. \nInside, options range from stainless steel scuff plates with backlit Brabus logo in 64 colours (just like the standard ambient lighting) to aluminium accessories such as pedals and door pins. Also available is the “soft yet durable” Brabus Mastik leather and Alcantara in any desired colour.
