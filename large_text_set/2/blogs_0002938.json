They erased deficits for 21-0 and 28-3 against the Atlanta Falcons and their high-powered offense, scoring 31 unanswered points to pull off an incredible comeback.\nThe Patriots scored 19 fourth quarter points, with James White finding capping off a 10-play, 91-yard drive with a six-yard touchdown with 57 seconds left. Tom Brady hit Amendola with a short pass on the two-point conversion, and the receiver fought his way across the goal line to knot things up at 28-28.\nIn overtime, the Patriots won the coin toss and never gave Atlanta a chance. They marched 85 yards down the field, with White punching it in from two yards out.\nIt’s the fifth Super Bowl win for Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady.\nAfter the Patriots cut it to 28-12 on a Stephen Gostkowski 33-yard field goal, the New England defense got them the ball back. Don’t’a Hightower hit Matt Ryan, forcing a fumble that Alan Branch recovered at the Atlanta 25. Four plays later, Brady hit Danny Amendola for a six-yard touchdown, and a two-point conversion on a direct snap to James White cut Atlanta’s lead to 28-20 with 5:56 to go.\nThe defense forced another Atlanta punt and the Patriots had the ball back with 2:38 left in the game. Julian Edelman made an incredible catch on the drive, hauling in a bobbled ball between three Atlanta defenders, and a few plays later the Patriots had things all knotted up on the White touchdown and Amendola conversion.\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:26:27.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
