In dismissing the case, she wrote that “there does not appear to be any chance that Monsanto or [its co-plaintiffs] can amend their complaints to state valid claims under any of the theories they can rely upon.” \nRead more \nOnce a chemical is added to the state list, the manufacturer has a year before it must be labeled as a cancer-causing substance, said Sam Delson, spokesman for the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. \nEnvironmental protection and labor groups such as the National Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, the AFL-CIO and the Environmental Law Foundation joined the state in challenging Monsanto’s lawsuit. \n“For thirty years, Proposition 65 has helped inform Californians about their exposure to harmful chemicals. The court’s decision upholds that right and will ensure that California continues to promptly list chemicals classified as carcinogens by respected scientific entities,” said Katie Schaefer, an attorney for the Sierra Club. \nRead more \nIARC’s 2015 report on glyphosate ignited heated debate around the use of Roundup, and caused several European Union countries – including France, Sweden, and the Netherlands – to object to the renewal of the glyphosate’s EU license. The license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration. \nThe agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and “widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and…freedom from conflicts of interest.” \nIARC was later criticized for allegedly advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its glyphosate classification. The agency said it had tried to protect the study from “external interference” while protecting its intellectual rights. \nVia RT .
