Goodbye, seven-term congressman J. Randy Forbes (R).\nTheir unexpected paths to victory — or early retirement — reveal the extent to which the nuances of an elections map can help determine winners and losers.\nThe Virginia map changes started with a lawsuit filed by Democratic lawyer Marc E. Elias in 2013.\nHe argued a district represented by Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (D) illegally packed enough African Americans into its boundaries to diminish their influence elsewhere. Elias said the Virginia congressional case in some ways was a model for lawsuits in North Carolina and at the state level in Virginia, for which he is awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.\n“We learned a lot in Virginia about how the Republican legislature approaches redistricting, and the Republican legislature hopefully learned that it can’t abuse its powers,” Elias said Friday.\nThe federal judges eventually handed down a new map that moved a significant number of African American voters, a group that tends to vote for Democrats, into Forbes’s district.\nFleeing the prospect of a tough race, Forbes ran in the neighboring Republican district, anchored by Virginia Beach. But he lost the primary by 12 points to Taylor, a 37-year-old former Navy SEAL whose views reflect a new generation of GOP lawmakers and the waning influence of evangelical voters.\nBack in Forbes’s old district, a Democrat, McEachin, won easily won.\nMcEachin, a 55-year-old personal-injury lawyer and former head of his caucus in the state Senate, will be the third-ever African American to represent Virginia in Washington.\n[ Tiny office, minority party and little power? It’s all terrific to McEachin. ]\nThe newly drawn district consolidates the power of voters in Richmond, who were previously split between Forbes and Scott.\nMcEachin said the previous map “egregiously minimized the impact of certain voters,” and he applauded the change as a good start.\n“The federal court said the Virginia congressional redistricting was so unfair and illegitimate that they overturned it,” he said in a statement. “I am pleased that now voters’ voices matter and that, at least in this instance, votes count.”\nIn Virginia Beach, Taylor and Forbes waged a bitter battle over a district that includes eight military instillations, including Naval Station Norfolk and Joint Base Langley-Eustis.\nMonths after the primary, tensions were still running high when Taylor’s campaign manager tried to join the local GOP committee in Forbes’s stronghold of Chesapeake. His application was rejected.\nAlthough Forbes touted his chairmanship of a congressional subcommittee with say over Navy ships, Taylor emphasized his military experience to create an instant rapport with voters — and painted Forbes as a carpetbagger.\n“You’re running to save your own butt, and I have no respect for that at all,” Taylor said of Forbes. “I think he could have beat Don [McEachin]. I just think it was a dumb mistake. He should have fought.”\nA foreign-policy hawk and occasional guest on Fox News, Taylor has conservative credibility but is a moderate on social issues. He favors gay rights, says climate change is real and supports the decriminalization of marijuana in small amounts.\n“He doesn’t fit that mold of the kind of Republican congressional member that we’ve had in Virginia forever and ever,” said Quentin Kidd, a political-science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News.\nIn the end, Forbes, founder of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, could not find enough common ground with voters — many of them young, independent-minded service members — in the district that is home to televangelist Pat Robertson’s Regent University.\n“It’s not that there aren’t social conservatives in Virginia Beach, but [Taylor] is the first Republican officeholder to represent the middle-aged and younger Republican,” Kidd said.\n[ Virginia congressman visits Trump Tower in search of Navy post ]\nStarting with the 115th Congress, Virginia will be represented by seven Republicans and four Democrats, but Democrats argue that to truly represent voters, the breakdown should be closer to six Democrats and five Republicans.\nIn Virginia, Democrats have won every statewide race since 2009, and Virginia was the only Southern state to favor Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the presidential race.\nBut Republicans control the congressional delegation and the General Assembly.\nBrian Cannon, executive director of OneVirginia2021, which favors nonpartisan redistricting, said there is more work to do.\n“The court stuck with the basic framework of Virginia, so it’s still pretty messed up, especially in Northern Virginia,” Cannon said. “This proves that politicians didn’t do a good job the first time and we need a better process.”\nHis group is suing the state over the unwieldy shape of six state Senate and five state House of Delegates districts. In a case set to go to trial in mid-March, it will argue the map violates a law that says districts must be compact.\nState lawmakers are set to redraw legislative and congressional districts again in five years.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@jennaportnoy"], "published": "2017-01-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T03:02:14.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
