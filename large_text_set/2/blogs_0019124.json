Must report that 100% the sequel will not happen. And that is to be the final thing about it\n— Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) February 21, 2017 \nIt’s a bit of a bummer to see, really, as any fan of the Hellboy franchise can tell you. By all indications, things seemed to be moving along pretty okay, what with Ron Perlman also being on board, ready to reprise the role should the need arise. But I guess it just wasn’t meant to happen, and—here’s the frustrating part—we don’t exactly know why. As you can see in his tweet, del Toro said that he spoke to all parties involved, but came back empty-handed. That’s it. He didn’t really follow up with any more information (nor does he really need to, despite fans’ desperate pleas for explanations as to why), and as it stands now, we may never really know why.\nPerlman responded to the report shortly after del Toro’s tweet went live.\nSuperhero seeks employment.
