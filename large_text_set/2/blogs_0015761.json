They aren’t interested in reinventing the wheel like so many boutique companies strive to do - they’re more concerned with what people really want: a beautiful instrument with a rich tone that plays with ease. \nHand-wound pickups, a selection of bridges and tailpieces that recall classic instruments from Gretsch and Gibson (335s particularly), and a novel body design that takes a Telecaster’s uncut horn and mirrors it to the other side - the results are fantastic. The No. 3 model in particular has the type of global appeal that could propel the company to great heights. And that’s just the aesthetic perspective. \nA growing list of notable professional musicians that have sought out Andy to get ahold of one of his guitars would certainly attest to the tonal quality and playability. \nI took it upon myself to learn a bit more about the company by interviewing Andy. Read on to get a better idea of what the T guitar company is all about. Andy Thomson \nJoel: How did you get started in the business of lutherie? How’d you learn and what was your inspiration? \nAndy: Well I actually finished a Landscaping apprenticeship in 2008 and didn’t want to continue in that as my career. My best mate worked in a guitar shop and they were looking someone to sell drum sets (I grew up playing drums) and so I took up the job as something to get me through Christmas, whilst I worked out what I wanted to do for a ‘real’ job. Turns out the owner of the guitar store built and repaired Guitars and Basses, Mando’s, Violins etc and once I saw him at work I knew that what I wanted to do. I worked there repairing mostly for 4 years and then in 2013 I moved to Melbourne, Aus to study a 12-month course in Guitar Building and repair and in November 2013 I started T Guitars, with the Model No.3. \nJoel: What inspired the final design and hardware specs of your flagship T #3 models? How long did it take to arrive at this? \nAndy: The T No.3 is definitely born out of my love of the Fender Telecaster, Gibson Firebird/Non Reverse, and the Hofner Very Thins of the 60’s. I scribbled out a few rough ideas and the No.3 shape you see is ends result of me wanting to create a guitar that would really stand out but not look out of place hung on any guitar store wall. \nRe the hardware and specs, although when fitted with a B5 Bigsby the Number three does give off a Gretchy vibe I want to be able to cater to anyones tonal taste. So we offer almost any pickups and hardware fitout that the customer desires. Although we do have our limit to the options as we need to keep our brand image in line, so you won’t find things like Floyd Rose’s or EMG’s anywhere near our guitars. Or if you do, it wasn’t us! ha \nJoel: You seem to have quite a few musicians flaunting your guitars on stage - do you make endorsement deals with guitarists or are they generally just guys who have come to you to get a cool guitar? Did you make any custom instruments for any of these people? \nAndy: Yeah we have been pretty fortunate to have some great acts using our guitars. Working in a Guitar store taught me that Artist influence is a huge driving force for buyers. And as we are in our infancy in regards to our Brand we knew from the outset that the quicker we could get our guitars in the hands of touring artists the quicker we could establish ourselves as a genuine guitar brand. Its hard to convince Joe or Joan in Ohio of our brand quality or sound through images on our website and because we aren’t yet at the stage of having quantities to stock internationally we knew people needed to see our guitars in action to see there are real option and not just paper mache frauds. \nJoel: Between your T #3, #5, and #9, I’m seeing a consistent use of the P90 pickups - what specific brands do you use in your guitars and what’s your general thoughts and reasoning on your affinity to them? \nAndy: We hand wind our own Pickups. We make our own ’T-90s (which are Humbucker 90’s mounted like a soapbar, which i think might be unique to us - not that we’ve reinvented the wheel by doing this haha, but thats why we call them T90’s) Soapbar P90’s, Soapbar mounted Mini Humbuckers, and Humbuckers. We will happily install other branded pickups. We’ve used Lollar Broilers and TV Jones’s filtertrons and have had great results with these. So our aim is to offer as many tonal options as we can. \nWith our affinity towards T90’s. I think we’ve used these so often because with loaded the first few T No.3’s with T90’s and I suppose people thought when demo’ing the early No.3 that that was a great sound and so continued to ask for them? plus they’re really cost affective for us. Great fun to make and sound great so its a win win win for us. \nThe specs of our T90s are just over wound to a P90. 42g Formvar. Nothing to special. No magic dust or gypsy tears. \nJoel: What’s your position in the endless tonewood debate? While we’re at it, what type of woods to you tend to use in your guitar models, and why? \nAndy: Quite simply the only ‘law’ we hold ourselves to in regard to tone wood is making sure our necks are cut from 1st grade quartersawn timbers. Maple or Mahogany. Thats it. I believe if you neck isn’t quartersawn there is no point worrying about what the body is made of because even if its a perfect piece of Ash or Mahogany (or whatever) it won’t receive the optimal sound transfer through the neck anyways. Bolt on, Set Neck or Neck through is neither here nor there for me, but the neck has to be quarter sawn for the best sustain and tonal transfer to the body. Period. \nWe primarily use Kauri (a pine) in our bodies. I grew up in Kauri St as a kid and so had an instant connection to it when I first came across its as a possible tone wood. We have used Ash, Alder and Mahogany as well in the past, be we tend to lean towards Kauri as we find it works well on the tools and sounds just as good as the other options. We don’t care for Quilted or Flame bs. don’t care for “rare” or “exotic” timbers, there are enough of those type of buidlers about to service that niche. \nJoel: Are you currently working on any new models or innovations? \nAndy: You may have noticed the No.7 model is missing from our line up. This one has caused me more trouble in design then any other to get right. 3, 5, and 9 all came together relatively easily, I mean they’re pretty simple shapes anyway. But with the No.7 I’m going for a smaller, short scale only, Jnr style guitar. Like a No.5 Jnr but a lil different, in the 60’s Kay, Harmony, Silvertone vibe with a continuation of the T style. Its harder then Id hoped haha. Or maybe I’ve just run out of ideas hahaha. \nIm also in the search for a new Single coil design. Just aesthetically, not internals or anything. Id like to push a unique looking single coil to fit into our guitars and maybe cater to the country, flat picking guitarists. Or anyone after a more classic Single coil sound. I think once we’ve worked this out we pretty much have our playing field sorted and we simply just have to get busy building guitars. \nJoel: Give us a quick run down of a day in the life of a luthier - what are your thoughts on your job and business? \nAndy: I try to arrange my days doing repairs and setups in the morning from 7am until somewhere around 11am or Midday. Then build into the evening. Sunday Mondays are my days off (if ever they are truly spent ‘off’) and I find the hardest part of the whole job is being self-controlled enough to get in and get busy. I love what I do, I love the little team we have working for T Guitars and we’re really working to build our little business into a bigger little business. \nT Guitar Company", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:48:45.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
