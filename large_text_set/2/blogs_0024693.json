With 'banter' the preferred social currency of every dressing room in the land, how do you think a group of Premier League players would react if their team's assistant manager accidentally sent them all a picture that was meant for his wife? \nWould they quietly and discreetly alert the staff member and forget about his unfortunate mistake? Or would they absolutely destroy him for it? \nUnfortunately for Eric Black - Claude Puel's No2 at Southampton - he has recently found out the answer to that question. Southampton manager Claude Puel with his unfortunate assistant Eric Black (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nWith the EFL Cup Final against Manchester United fast approaching, Saints star Nathan Redmond has been talking to Match of the Day magazine about the spirit in the Southampton squad. \nIn the interview, Redmond revealed that there is a group WhatsApp chat at the club, saying, “When the banter’s flying, it’s flying!” Nathan Redmond: Southampton's Archbishop of Banter-bury (sorry) (Photo: John Powell) \nThe next part of the chat revealed just what he meant. \nExplaining that the image on the chat is one of Black, their assistant manager, Redmond says: “He was meant to send a pic to his wife, but sent it to the group by accident. It’s him blowing a kiss in the mirror with a love heart in lipstick on the mirror!” \nOh dear, Eric. \nThe lesson here? Always be very, very careful that messages intended for your wife don't end up in the hands of banter-loving footballers… \"Hey boys, come on… leave Eric alone, huh?\" (Photo: Getty Images Europe) To read the full interview, pick up a copy of Match of the Day Magazine this Tuesday.
