Apologies to our regular sponges…we just really like sparkly things! A Kickstarter page has been started for the self -proclaimed “World’s First Perfect Makeup Blender,” known as the Evie Blender .\nMakeup artist Angie Johnson, who works with both beauty and FX makeup, is the inventor behind the Evie Blender. While it is made from silicone like the Silisponge , the Evie Blender maintains the pointed egg shape of traditional makeup sponges, similar to ones from BeautyBlender and Real Techniques. What makes the Evie Blender super special is that it’s made from medical grade silicone and has a textured finish.\nEvie Blender / Kickstarter We talked to Johnson about her inspiration behind this innovative new tool. “I used sponges and beauty blenders and my co-workers used them as well,” she explains, before adding, “I got so frustrated that I would use them once and then they would look stained so quickly. I’d see artists throwing them away and I thought about how much waste that created.”\nEvie Blender / Kickstarter “I make prosthetics too and had different silicones to play with, so I thought, ‘what if I could make a textured sponge?’ I knew it would solve all the problems I was having, but the right texture and softness was essential to blend makeup perfectly,” she continues. See it in action here:\n#EvieBlender in action #coolasheckhaha #glitter #beauty #makeup \nA video posted by Evie Blender (@evieblender) on Jan 5, 2017 at 3:30pm PST \nJohnson says she tried about five different designs with various silicones before finding what she calls Evie Blender’s “magic combo.” \nEvie Blender / Kickstarter \nSays Johnson: “I love this shape because the wider bottom was easy for foundation and blush and the pointed end is perfect for under the eyes and around the nose.” \nEv In the Kickstarter demo video, we can see how not only how the Evie wastes much less product than traditional blenders, but how it’s much easier to clean, too. Evie Blender / Kickstarter The campaign claims that with proper care the Evie will last over a year, in contrast to other sponges that only last a couple of months.\nEvie Blender / Kickstarter The campaign only runs for two weeks and has a goal of $28K. Backers who pledge at least $28 will receive a first-edition silver glitter Evie Blender and reusable cloth bag, while those who pledge at least $100 will receive one in the custom color of their choice, with or without glitter, and a printed cloth bag. That’s pretty neat!\nHonestly, you already had us at custom makeup sponge color with glitter! Find more about the Evie Blender and contribute to their Kickstarter here . We want this blender in our hands, ASAP!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T03:07:35.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
