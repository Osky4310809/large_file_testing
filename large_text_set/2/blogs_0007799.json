McCarty hit one of two foul shots with 24 seconds left, putting Texas up five (81-76), and Briana Taylor rounded out the scoring with a layup with four seconds left. \nHolmes added 18 points and 10 rebounds for Texas, which won the points in the paint - 42-38 - primarily thanks to the penetration of McCarty, Atkins and Higgs (16 points). Texas was relentless in grabbing rebounds and running and scoring in transition. \nThe Longhorns' outscored BU 10-0 in fast-break points and overcame 24 points from Baylor sophomore, 6-foot-7 center Kalani Brown and 19 points from Alexis Jones, the older sister of Texas freshman guard Andrew Jones. \nNEXT UP: ...
