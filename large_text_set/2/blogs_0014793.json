It also forges connects and warns us of danger, apart from enhancing pleasure.\nAs a pre-teen getting orthodontic treatment, my protection against inevitable pain was to think of soldiers who faced bullets on the battlefield. ‘If they can bear that pain, this is nothing in comparison,’ I would tell myself. Almost instantly my threshold for pain would jack up.\nI also remember an earlier time when I caught my thumb between a wildly swinging gate and the wall. I ran to my mother in utter pain. In her shocked agitation, she slapped me for swinging on the gate despite warnings! The shock and humiliation of that slap overtook the pain of my throbbing thumb.\nAll grown up and battling the wrenching grief of losing a father I was deeply connected to and revered, the only thing that alleviated my anguish somewhat was the realization of how much worse it would have been if we had lost him even earlier or suddenly, without warning.\nPain kills pain. The thought of a bigger agony helps us deal better with a smaller anguish. Pain also connects and forges bonds. Going through your own pain helps you empathise and connect with people going through similar pain.\nAs kids when we looked with surprise at people wailing at the tragedy that befell another, Mom would say enigmatically, “Nobody is crying for another. We all cry for the pain we have ourselves suffered.” She was so right. Another’s pain reminds us of our own – either some agony we have suffered or fear suffering — and that is what forges an instant connect and deepens sympathy.\nExperiments have proved that groups involved in a shared activity that causes pain emerge better bonded and cooperative rather than those engaged in non-painful activity. Team sports or executive challenges and even groups undertaking challenging tasks together report positive social gluing. That is possibly also the reason behind some social and religious practices around the world that involve an element of pain.\nPain also strikes a deeper emotional chord than pleasure. Our most intense memories are the ones where we suffered most. While pleasure makes us feel better about ourselves, pain makes us aware of the present moment and attunes us more to the sensory world. No wonder then that …\nOur sincerest laughter\nWith some pain is fraught;\nOur sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.\n( To a Skylark, P.B. Shelley)\nPain also provides a contrast for pleasure, enhancing the relief of the latter. Think about extreme physical exertion, which results in a happy “runners’ high”. This is achieved by endorphins released when the body suffers pain or stress. Endorphins activate opioid receptors in the brain, which minimize the discomfort and create a feeling of euphoria. And hence it is the pain that actually activates the resultant pleasure. Can we put love, with its pleasurable pains and painful pleasures in the same category? It is after all the one pain that nobody is willing to give up on! Remember Raj Kapoor’s smile when at his saddest?\nIf we were things born\nNot to shed a tear,\nI know not how thy joy we ever should come near.\nPain also gives us a feeling of entitlement. Think — a cold beer after an exhausting day, a chocolate after a punishing workout, a drink after some brilliant writing or reading! Some people report overeating at times of grief for the same reason.\nMuch like fever, pain is also a wake-up call that brings our attention to issues we need to deal with – physical, mental, emotional or even spiritual. A good understanding of pain and the positives it could lead to helps us understand and manage it better. When you know there may be light at the end of the tunnel, you can face the darkness with more confidence.\nAnd of course who can forget the beautiful-in-pain Nimmi in the Dilip Kumar-Madhubala starrer Amar !\n“Na milta gam to barbadi ke afsaane kahaan jaate\nAgar duniya chaman hoti, toh veerane kahan jaate…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:47:27.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
