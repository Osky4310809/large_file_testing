MPs can claim the cost of carrying out their parliamentary duties and working in their electorates The allowances are paid on top of their salaries and some are uncapped Allowances have grown over time, and include things such as daily expenses, family travel and accommodation Receipts are required and the system is administered by the Department of Finance There is no clear definition of what constitutes \"parliamentary business\". MPs make their own assessment of the rules \nMr Turnbull said: \"I expect the highest standards from my ministers in all aspects of their conduct, and especially the expenditure of public money.\" \nOpposition health spokeswoman Catherine King said Ms Ley did not have a credible explanation for charging taxpayers for the trips. \n\"These revelations make it crystal clear that Malcolm Turnbull must sack Sussan Ley,\" Ms King said. \n\"Either she must walk or Mr Turnbull must push her.\" Other scandals \nHowever, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said Ms Ley also had \"legitimate business\" on the Gold Coast. \n\"If they made a purchase - even though I admit it's a substantial purchase - that is not the reason she went to the Gold Coast,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. \n\"She went to the Gold Coast for work ... people are saying she concocted a reason to do a policy announcement on the Gold Coast. I think that is a bit rich.\" \nParliamentary Speaker Bronwyn Bishop was forced to resign in 2015 after using A$5,000 in public funds to charter a helicopter to attend a political fundraiser. \nIn October, senior Victorian politician Steve Herbert apologised for using his taxpayer-funded chauffeur to transport his dogs 120km (80 miles) to his country house.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T03:08:08.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
