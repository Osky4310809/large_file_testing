Tom Brady & Bridget Moynahan: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 10:43 am EST, September 23, 2016 39 Comments By Jacqueline Klecak 99.4k Share Tweet Follow Tom Brady and Bridget Moynahan at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in 2005, weeks after Brady led the Patriots to their third Super Bowl title. (Getty) \nTom Brady has more on his mind than beating the Giants on Sunday. His wife, retired supermodel Gisele Bundchen , opened up in an interview yesterday about how hard it was dealing with the news of Brady’s ex-girlfriend, Bridget Moynahan , being pregnant with his baby in 2007—right after the model and quarterback started dating. \nIt seems Brady has it all together on the field, often called the best player in the league, not to mention ESPN NFL Nation reporters almost unanimously voted Brady to be the midseason MVP. \nBut there is often drama, and the unavoidable scrutiny , when it comes to the women in Brady’s life. Being married to and having two children with Bundchen , while trying to maintain a relationship with Moynahan and their son John can certainly get complicated. \nHere’s what you need to know about their relationship: 1. Moynahan Is an Actress & Recently Wrote a Cookbook Donnie Wahlberg, Tom Selleck, Bridget Moynahan and Will Estes arrive to a screening and panel discussion of CBS’s “Blue Bloods.” Moynahan has starred in the show since 2010 (Getty) \nThe 43-year-old danced her way – literally – onto the movie screen alongside Tyra Banks in the movie Coyote Ugly . Since then she has been in other major films such as Serendipity , The Sum of All Fears and I, Robot . \nShe has also taken her talents to the TV screen, making appearances in Sex and the City , as Mr. Bigs’ love interest, and Six Degrees , about the intertwined destinies of six New Yorkers, and since 2010 she has held a main role in CBS’ Blue Bloods , about a family of cops. \nMost recently, she has been promoting “ The BlueBloods Cookbook ,” on shows such as The Chew and The Rachael Ray Show . A centerpiece of the show is the family dinners the characters enjoy together and this cookbook was published to inspire a, “successful family dinner of family, love and food.” My new cookbook is out!

Moynahan Gave Birth to Brady’s Son Jack in 2007 Tom Brady’s children Vivian, Benjamin and Jack show pride for their father’s team. (Instagram/ Gisele Bundchen) \nBrady and Moynahan started dating in 2004 before calling it quits in December of 2006. \nShortly after the breakup, Brady started dating Bundchen. Then in February 2007, Moynahan announced she was more than three-months pregnant with both her and Brady’s first child. \nJohn, known as Jack, was born on August 22, 2007 in Santa Monica and in July 2008 Moynahan opened up to Harper’s Bazaar about her thoughts during and following the pregnancy. She said she was “heartbroken” and pregnant. \nWhen you’re suddenly pregnant and no one is standing by your side, even if you’re in your 30s, it’s a hard conversation. I’m a traditional girl, and I believe in marriage, and I just always thought that’s the way I’d be doing this. For a moment, it was hard for me to accept that this was the way I was going to have a family. \nShe told Bazaar that when she brought home Jack for the first time, she cried. \nI walk in and just started sobbing. All of a sudden, you have this newborn you have no training for. It’s frightening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:43:05.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
