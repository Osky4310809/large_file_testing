We still have aunty jis , mama jis , friends and families popping this question and demanding an answer like it's their right to be 100 per cent involved in your love life. While they refuse to let up, that in no way means that you have to put up with their shit. Here are some really kickass answers to their constant interference. 1. Beta you are so smart, good looking and fun. Why can't you find a boy? \nI don't know auntyji, maybe I am overqualified for this shit! 2. Thirty and still single. How? \nJust got lucky I guess *crosses fingers* 3. You need a man in your old age beta to take care of you. \nAunty, I have my cats, hai na ? 4. All this modern bullshit of being in love and not getting married is stupid. Find a boy. \nWere Radha and Krishna married? KThnxBye aunty. 5. I want to see my grandkids before I die. \nDon't worry mom, I don't need to be married to have kids *wink* 6. You are so beautiful, look around and you'll find so many boys. \nUncleji are you hitting on me *cue dramatic expressions* 7. You are wasting your life. \nWhat! Have you even seen my Twitter followers list? 8. Beta .... \n*start sobbing* (really loudly). 9. Beta think of the future. \nAren't we all going to be single eventually. When we DIE? *stare pointedly and make them uncomfortable* 10. This year I think you should find a boy. \nOr a sex robot? I hear they're creating them. *creepy smile* Gifs via Tumblr / Giphy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T09:49:43.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
