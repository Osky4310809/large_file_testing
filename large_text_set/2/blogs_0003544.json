In addition to \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" Hamilton 's Phillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry, and Jasmine Cephas Jones added another performance to the roster. The trio harmonized perfectly as they sang a gorgeous rendition of \"America the Beautiful.\" To add a little feminist flair to the classic song, they also put a cherry on top: after singing \"And crown thy good with brotherhood,\" they added \" . . . and sisterhood.\" Watch the snippet of the performance above to be filled with sheer brilliance.
