By Mark Belko / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nCities like New York and Chicago have been bubbling with trendy food halls featuring specialty chefs, sit-down restaurants, and vendors. Now one is coming to Downtown Pittsburgh. \nOxford Market — a marketplace that will offer restaurants, chef demonstrations, wine tastings and other food options — is expected to open in One Oxford Centre this summer. \nSan Francisco-based Shorenstein Properties LLC, the new owner of the 45-story Grant Street skyscraper, has completed an agreement with Eurest, a $1.4 billion food and vending division of Compass Group North America, to bring the concept to Downtown. \nThe 12,000-square-foot food hall will be located in the lower level of the building, taking up space formerly occupied by Easy Street restaurant, which has closed, and management offices. The food hall will use Oxford's outdoor plaza during warmer weather. \nIt is expected to include restaurants featuring international fare, including Mexican and Italian offerings, as well as specialty concepts focused on salads and healthy meal options. \nThe food hall also will be home to Create Exhibition, a space where visitors will have access to chef demonstrations, wine tastings and other events. Eurest plans to partner with a number of popular Pittsburgh restaurants and celebrity chefs as part of the endeavor. \nShorenstein sees the food hall as catering to Downtown residents, in addition to office workers and visitors to the city. \n\"Oxford Market will offer residents and office tenants in Downtown Pittsburgh a space to gather for lunch, dinner or a fun night out,\" said Christopher Caltabiano, Shorenstein's senior vice president of asset management. \"We're very pleased with the progress that has been made at One Oxford Centre and look forward to continuing to enhance the building's iconic status as part of Pittsburgh's skyline.\" \nShorenstein representatives toured more than a dozen food halls in New York and Chicago in search of the best concept for Pittsburgh. \nIn a statement, Jeremy Waldrup, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, said food halls have been expanding in major markets around the country. \n\"Shorenstein's vision for this project is bringing in new amenities that will benefit office workers and our growing residential community while supporting Pittsburgh's innovative and evolving restaurant scene,\" he said. \nOxford Market will be part of $50 million in renovations that Shorenstein, a real estate investment company, is making to the property. Au Bon Pain and a sushi restaurant are expected to remain in the lower level of the building. \nBased in Charlotte, N.C., Compass Group North America is a leading food service management and support services company that posted $14.5 billion in revenues in 2015. It is part of United Kingdom-based Compass Group PLC. \nMark Belko: mbelko@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1262.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T20:05:02.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
