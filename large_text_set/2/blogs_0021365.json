Slot to Alabama Crimson Tide Links \nSEC Network analyst Booger McFarland doesn't believe Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops should suspend quarterback Baker Mayfield for next season's opener after his arrest Saturday , citing precedent Alabama's Nick Saban set during last year's offseason with Cam Robinson. \nMcFarland on Sunday spoke freely on Twitter about several topics involving college football's biggest stories in recent days, but may strike a nerve with those in Tuscaloosa and Norman: \nIf I'm Bob Stoops I don't suspend Baker Mayfield 1 game.. Saban didn't suspend Robinson at all last year What's the difference ? — Booger (@SECbooger) February 26, 2017 \nSaban handled Robinson and teammate Hootie Jones' arrests on weapon and drug charges internally and did not further discipline his players with a loss of playing time. Robinson and Jones were charged with possession of marijuana, but the district attorney later decided not to prosecute either player. \nMayfield faces charges of public intoxication, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and has a hearing scheduled for Monday. \nSaban's handling of Robinson's situation drew intense ire from SEC Network analyst Paul Finebaum, leading to a well-publicized spat on-air during SEC Media Days.
