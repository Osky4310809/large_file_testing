Photo by the author \nLocated in Toronto's Little Italy, College Street Bar is a spot that's popular for its flair bartenders, and live music. But instead of its regular Friday night crowd last night, a small group of protesters were standing outside the bar, this time celebrating a victory. Protesters told VICE the bar had been open last week. \nAs they held signs advocating for a safer service industry, some teared up with joy and other's yelled, \"We believe her.\" \nThe demonstration was organized by a local advocacy group called the Sexual Assault Action Coalition. On Thursday, Viktoria Belle, one of the group's co-founders, met with Toronto Councilor Mike Layton about their concerns with College Street Bar remaining open. \n\"Right away, [Layton] said he would to put a motion together to have their liquor licence and their live music licence taken away,\" Belle told VICE. According to Belle, the Alcohol and Gaming Commision of Ontario (AGCO) are now reviewing and the bar's liquor and business licenses. \n\"College Street Bar should be closed until after the trial and [when] there's a verdict met because it has remained open to the patronage without any sort of transparency or any knowledge of what's going on inside or who's working the bar,\" Belle told VICE. \nRead More: How Rape Complainants Are Having Their Social Media Feeds Used Against Them in Court \nService industry workers say the alleged sexual assault is not an isolated case. Neesha Temple, one of the protesters and a current service industry worker, told VICE the industry must do more to protect employees. \n\"I've been assaulted in this industry before and it's unfortunate to say that I did keep my mouth shut and I didn't feel like I had a voice,\" Temple said. \"It's really unfortunate that, when we want to let loose on a Friday night, this is what happens.\" \nThe alleged assault at College Street Bar comes after changes to Ontario's Occupational Health and Safety Act required employers to implement protocol for dealing with sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. As establishments continue to fail these provisions, service industry workers and activists including the Sexual Assault Action Coalition plan to bring awareness of these very prominent issues to Toronto's government. \nFollow Ebony on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T09:18:36.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
