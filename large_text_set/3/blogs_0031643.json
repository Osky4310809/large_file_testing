Thursday’s Senate hearing lacks the star power of a high ranking intelligence official like James Comey, but interviews with both scholars and cybersecurity experts should create some context around Russia’s disinformation efforts , “focusing on a primer in Russian active measures and influence campaigns.” \nThe day will be divided into two separate panels, with a morning focus on “the history and characteristics” of Russian campaigns, and the afternoon on “the role and capabilities of cyber operations in support of these activities.” \nThe first panel will feature Eugene Rumer, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Georgetown Professor of Government Emeritus Roy Godson and Clint Watts, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute’s program on national security. \nThe afternoon will take a turn toward tech, with testimony from FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia and retired general and IronNet Cybersecurity CEO Keith Alexander. Alexander was previously the director of the NSA. \n— CSPAN (@cspan) March 29, 2017 \nToday in remarks about the committee’s ongoing investigation, Chairman Richard Burr and Vice Chairman Mark Warner revealed that they have a list of 20 witnesses they plan to bring in. \n“We anticipate inviting additional individuals to come and be interviewed, and ultimately some of those interviewed individuals may turn into private or public hearings by the committee,” Burr said. “It would be safe to say we have had conversations with a lot of people, and it would be safe to say [former Trump National Security Adviser] Gen. Flynn is a part of that list.” \nThe first part of the hearing will begin at 10 a.m. Eastern time, with the cybersecurity panel starting at 2 p.m. Both should be viewable on a C-SPAN3 livestream .
