On these 10 new routes, Norwegian is offering the $65 introductory fare — a price that’s hard to beat. However, once the introductory period has ended, which wasn’t specified, the lowest fare will increase to $99 one-way. \nNorwegian SVP of Sales Lars Sande said that fares from Europe to the US on these new routes will also hover around the same mark, but vary based on the taxes from the specific airport. It’s possible to get a very cheap round-trip ticket between the US and Europe with these new fares, but it might take some time playing around with the dates. \nIn Quarter 2 of this year, Norwegian will accept delivery of six new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which it will then use on these new routes. The latest addition to the Norwegian fleet has a range of 3,515 nautical miles, which leaves the options for expansion open to new European, North American and — potentially — Asian cities. \nNorwegian’s 737 MAX will feature 189 economy seats in a 3-3 configuration — there will be no Premium cabin, as Norwegian features on its Dreamliner aircraft. The carrier will continue to offer travelers the option to bundle additional fees when they book, but the focus is on the low-cost ticket. As a reminder, Norwegian is a low-cost carrier , so it charges for some things that are complimentary on other carriers, such as seat selection, meals and checked baggage. \nWhen Norwegian launches its 737 MAX aircraft into service on June 15, there will be no in-flight entertainment options. However, Sande said that it will eventually launch its Wi-Fi service on these new MAX routes. Once it launches its free Wi-Fi service, like the carrier offers on its intra-Europe routes, travelers will be able to browse the web from their own devices and stream content for an additional cost. \nBottom Line \nThis is great news for travelers looking for the cheapest fare when getting between the US Europe. Starting at just $65 one-way, these new fares from Norwegian are a great option. However, if you’re planning on taking advantage of one of these fares, it’s better to act sooner rather than later, as there’s no clue when these $65 introductory fares will expire. Even when they do expire, the next level of fares — $99 one-way — are still a great option, and very budget-friendly.
