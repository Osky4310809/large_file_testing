Judging by the happy bouncing around, Grover, Abby Cadabby, Elmo and Cookie Monster all approve of this stance.\n“‘S’ is for songs, and I love songs/Don’t know what I would do without ‘em/I love songs so much/I wanna sing a song about ‘em,” sang the “Chandelier” pop sensation.\nThis Sesame Street combo effort really drives home that folks feel really comfortable around Muppets. This is the most we’ve seen of Sia’s face in years and that’s quite the feat. It’d be like getting Kid Rock to degrease for popping up on the program. (Note: Do not invite Kid Rock on your program, Sesame Street . Prairie Dawn does not need a heavy right-wing makeover .)\nBask in the charms of Sia’s “S is for Songs” by hitting play on that magic video rectangle nestled above. There’s far less interpretive dance tucked inside than your standard Sia promo.\n(Via NME )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:02:53.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
