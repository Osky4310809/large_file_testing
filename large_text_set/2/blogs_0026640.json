Like the tight rugby league community it is, if you see someone you just go up and say hello even if you don’t know them. \n“I went up and said hello, he just asked me what I was doing and I said I was going back to find a job, I miss my kids too much and football didn’t mean as much as what my kids meant to me. \n“I drove from Brisbane to Bundaberg, heading up to Rockhampton, I got a call from my manager saying you’ve got to turn around — Ricky wants you to fly to Canberra and have a meeting.” \nThe rest, as they say, is history. \nTaylor met with Stuart and was gifted a train-and-trial deal with the Raiders.

I’d left to go to France and hadn’t seen my kids all year,” Taylor said. \n“I think about three weeks of the year I saw my kids, they mean everything to me and I made my decision that I was happy to come home and happy to find a normal job.” \nDo you live in Queensland?
