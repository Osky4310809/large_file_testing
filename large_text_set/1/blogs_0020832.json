But I have a plan. By Christopher Michel Tuesday, January 24, 2017, 1:15 pm Getty \nI started running late—in my mid 30s. But ever since I began, I’ve run about a marathon a year, and always in the fall. The reasons for this are mostly practical: while, as my sweatshirt says , I love running, it’s just one part of my life. So when I began, I used my marathon training, or the anticipation of it, as a way to keep myself in shape all year—especially through the heat of summer. It was also a chance to take a trip and visit extended family, as I mostly signed up for races near where they lived. \nI had goals, of course. The first year, it was to complete the thing. Every year after that, it was to get a little faster. Advertisement \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \nLast year, I attempted to PR at the Marine Corps Marathon . It was my first big race training and running as an editor at Runner’s World , and I’ll admit that I got a little overzealous. I pushed myself to keep up with an ambition training plan—one that would have shaved more than 20 minutes off my time, in the hopes I could leapfrog it into a Boston Qualifying time. \nInstead, I got an ankle injury early on that I didn’t take seriously enough, and I made it worse by not paying close enough attention to the weather or the race itself. I fell apart, barely completing it, and running my worst marathon ever— you can read about what happened here . \nI was embarassed, and frustrated, and honestly just not sure what to do next. Was I done trying to get faster? I’ve only run a handful of marathons (I started running in 2011), but I’m almost 40, and it felt entirely possible that my speediest days were already behind me. There are some who say runners only improve for about seven years , which is about as long as I’ve been running. \nI’d like to think that’s not true. I’d like to think that my injury was more a result of trying to build up both miles and speed too quickly. I’d like to think that, even if I don’t ever BQ, I’ll at least be able to have a few more good races in my future. \nSo this is my plan: I’m running an extra marathon this year—in the spring as well as the fall. And while my second race will be, I hope, a return to DC for the Marine Corps Marathon, I’m making my spring race one of the hilliest, hardest courses out there: Big Sur. \nMaybe this sounds like a terrible idea. But I have a plan. And my plan is this: no time goal. Instead of speed work, or intervals, I’ll be using those training days to simply focus on hills. I’ll also be spending a lot more time on strength-training —which I’ve never really done before—to hopefully stave-off any more injuries . \nBut mostly I’m planning on loping along for the next fourteen weeks, without any concern about getting faster, and then doing the race this April at a very comfortable pace. (What pace exactly? That’s personal .) \nI have two good reasons for this. The first is that I need a hard reset on my racing. I want this to be a fun, memorable experience to help me remember all the other reasons, besides getting faster, that I train for and run marathons. And there may be no better place to do that than Big Sur, which is one of the most legendarily beautiful races out there. \nThe other is that I want to build my miles and my endurance, so that when I move into the summer and begin thinking about that fall marathon, I will be in the best possible shape. and hopefully will set myself up to come back and race that course the way I wanted to last fall. Because I still haven’t given up on getting faster. I’m just trying to be a little smarter about it. \n* * * \nChristopher is training in preparation for the 2017 Big Sur Marathon with Runner’s World VIP.
