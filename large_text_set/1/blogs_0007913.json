Sing about Steven Gerrard \nThe United fans were in full voice throughout the game; winter games under the floodlights are when Old Trafford really comes alive. \nBut there was a curious moment in the 2nd half when a Steven Gerrard chant suddenly erupted from the Stretford End, as the United fans serenaded the ex-Liverpool captain over his infamous slip against Chelsea in 2014. \nLiverpool fans were quick to pick up on it and roundly mocked United fans for their obsessive chanting about Stevie G….against Hull. \nOf course, these Liverpool fans seem to have overlooked the fact that United play Liverpool next, so this wasn’t just random chanting about Gerrard; they were stoking the fires and raising the stakes ahead of the Reds’ arrival to Old Trafford… Them lot singing about 'Gerrard's slip' at home to Hull, thus proving Steven Gerrard is bigger than their entire club #FansAreShite #EFLCup", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:34:15.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
