This video explains all. Advertisement \nThe video, from youtuber Picturefit , goes over the pros and cons of using resistance bands for your workouts. On one hand, they’re great for those who are just getting started. If you don’t life weights already, you’ll definitely see some newbie gains from using resistance bands. Plus, they’re low impact and easy to use for beginners. \nOn the other hand, resistance bands can have an extremely wide range of resistance, making them less than ideal for some exercises. And you’ll probably get stronger faster than you realize and grow out of the light bands quickly, leaving you with the heavier bands that pull you instead of you pulling them. Basically, after a certain threshold is reached in your workouts, you’ll stop gaining muscle mass with resistance bands and have to move on to weights if you want to see those sweet gains. That said, Picturefit suggests you should eventually go for the best of both worlds and combine resistance bands with your weights. The combination of the two compensates for what each approach lacks on their own, and gives you the most comprehensive strength workout possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:19:13.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
