Police officer Laura Beal on a promotional Devon and Cornwall police poster \nI n her letter of resignation to Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer, Ms Beal, who served with the West Country force for 13 years, claimed she was frequently left to cover Mid Devon with just one other officer \nShe says her treatment in the organisation has caused her to succumb to anxiety, depression and stress and in a damning conclusion states: “I am leaving before this job kills me both physically and mentally.” \nHer letter comes after a report found that policing in Britain is in a \"potentially perilous\" state, with tens of thousands of suspects of crime roaming free in the community. \nHM Inspectorate of Constabulary has issued an unprecedented warning about the shortage of detectives and investigators, saying it amounted to a \"national crisis\". \nMs Beal, who joined the force in 2004 at the age of 19, said: \"[Devon & Cornwall Police] staff are not coping and are suffering because there is no one looking out for them. \n\"Please take it from someone who has been personally affected and has been so low she has wondered what the point of it all is and only through her friends and family been able to see that there is more to life than Policing. \n\"Front line response is where you need to focus your time and money. This is where the buck stops.\" \nMs Beal, from Exeter, has received dozens of messages of support on social media, including those of other police officers, and her letter has been shared and ‘liked’ more than 1,000 times. \nIn it she criticises Devon and Cornwall for its response to the crisis in police ranks. \n\"I could see the job I loved and the people I respect get ruined because of an organisation that puts its employees last,” she said. \n\"I know it's personal but I thought I'd share my resignation letter so you all know what this means to me and that it's not been an easy decision. \" \nMs Beal said she followed her father into the police and was proud to do so, but she blamed “the total lack of support both governmental and from the Chief Officer Group” for robbing her of her faith in the job she loved. \n“I would rather take the massive pay cut and quit than spend one day longer in a job that is making me ill,” she said. \nMs Beal, who has now started her own dog pampering and grooming firm, says she is experienced officers are being replaced by new recruits with few people skills. \nShe adds: “We are more like a business now in how we function in relation to finance and 'customer' relations, yet we are so far behind on employee rights.” \nHer letter has led to an admission by senior officers that the pressure of coping with increasing demands is leaving its toll on junior ranks. \nHowever it is understood there is anger at Ms Beal’s decision to go public with her complaints. \nChief Superintendent Jim Colwell, Devon Commander, said: “I am aware of PC Laura Beal’s resignation and am sympathetic to the reasons she gives for leaving the Force. \n“Being a police officer is not easy. We do hear concerns from officers and staff and recognise where they are feeling the strain. We acknowledge that these are issues undoubtedly have an impact on staff wellbeing.\" Chief Superintendent Jim Colwell admitted police were \"feeling the strain\" Credit: Emily Whitfield Wicks /South West News Service \nH e added: “I would like to formally thank PC Beal for her loyal service, hearing of an officer resigning is sad, particularly when this is done so publicly.” \nMr Colwell said the welfare of officers was a priority for Devon and Cornwall Police, which runs a peer support network, a counselling service and programme developed by the mental health charity Mind, to help them cope with stress. \nHe added that the force’s chief constable had last month announced that an extra 100 additional police officers were to be recruited for street patrols and local policing, as well as as additional 50 criminal investigators and 30 online record takers, bringing the total number back up to 3,000. \n“[This] should help to relieve the pressure,” said Mr Colwell.
