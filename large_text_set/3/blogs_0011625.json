Was he useful to the Yoruba race as President and now as former President? The bad state that he left major roads linking the South-West to other zones in Nigeria, especially the Lagos-Ibadan expressway remains a pointer to this. Yet, he goes about postulating as if he is the only honest Nigerian who can make things right in the country.” \nCopyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
