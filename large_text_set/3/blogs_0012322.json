Credit: Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo 17 March 2017 • 11:50pm \nA radical gene silencer drug could cut cholesterol by half, an “exciting” major study has found. \nAn international trial of 27,000 patients found that those who took the drug evolocumab saw their bad cholesterol levels fall by around 60 per cent on average. \nScientists say the new drug can prevent heart attacks and strokes by cutting bad cholesterol levels. \nThe patients in the trial were already taking statins, which are used to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. \nDespite this, the patients who took evolocumab saw their bad cholesterol levels fall even further. \nPatients who took the drug were also less likely to suffer from a heart attack or stroke than those who took the placebo. New drug could halve cholesterol.
