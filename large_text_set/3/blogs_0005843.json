I hear the Giants are interested, and I have not heard the same about the Packers, but if the money’s realistic, Green Bay makes so much sense,” King wrote in his MMQB column Wednesday. \nIn an interview with ESPN in January, Peterson listed the Giants, along with his hometown Houston Texans and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, as teams he would consider playing for if the Vikings released him. \nPeterson then stoked the flames with Big Blue last week, posting on Twitter: “The Giants been making some interesting moves.” The Giants been making some interesting moves. \n— Adrian Peterson (@AdrianPeterson) February 16, 2017 \nSpeaking at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Giants coach Ben McAdoo said the team would take a look at Peterson. \n“We’ll evaluate him and get a grade on anyone who is available, and we’ll make those decisions in terms of what’s best for the Giants moving forward,” he said. \nPeterson will turn 32 later this month and is coming off a season in which a knee injury limited him to three games and 72 yards rushing. \nHe told ESPN in January he wants to go to “a place where me and my family are comfortable” and he has “the opportunity to compete for a championship.” \nThe three-time rushing champ said he believes he still has “five more strong years, without a doubt.” \nThe Giants, who went 11-5 last season and reached the wild-card round of the playoffs, were ranked 29th in the NFL in rushing. They released leading rusher Rashad Jennings last month, but up-and-comer Paul Perkins and third-down back Shane Vereen are under contract for 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:59:06.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
