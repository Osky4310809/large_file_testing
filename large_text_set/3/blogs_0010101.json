Ha! I won’t be giving her a middle name, though.

We have a list of five - Brad chose two and I chose the rest - but we’re going to wait until she’s here before we decided. \n“Brad likes traditional names but I’m not too sure. I’m not saying mine are out there, but maybe a bit different. I really liked India at first, but I’ve gone off that now.” \nThe reality TV personality first revealed the sex of her baby in an interview with OK magazine, admitting she was stunned as she'd believed it would be a boy. \n\"I think I'm still in shock. Instinct told me it would be a boy. A psychic told me it was going to be a boy and lots of people I knew thought the same. \n\"I even ordered a boy Moncler baby bag because I was so convinced. But it's a girl!\". \nBrentwood-born Amy was told the child's gender after thirteen weeks, but added that she was happy to have a tot of either gender - as long as they were healthy. \n\"I don't mind as long as it's a healthy baby,\" she added. \"I've wanted a baby for so long.\" \nHer revelation came shortly after she shared an image of the scan via Instagram. The mother-to-be shared a snapshot of her baby with her 390,000 followers on the photo-sharing app. \nThe high-tech image shows the reality star's child in striking detail, with the baby's features clearly defined and pronounced. \nSeemingly lost for words at seeing her child's face, the emotional star simply captioned the snap: \"Words can't describe how much I love you.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T15:38:56.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
