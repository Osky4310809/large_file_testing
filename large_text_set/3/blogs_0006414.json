By age 15, Lou was boxing in barroom smokers for $5 a bout and working as a bowling alley pin boy. \n  He dropped out of school at 15 and forged a birth certificate saying he was 18 so he could work for the Civilian Conservation Corps in the Pacific Northwest, a New Deal program begun under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. There he learned to drive trucks and shoot craps, as he told it. While in the Army during World War II, he was a boxing instructor at Camp Hood, Tex. Duva — 5 feet 7 inches and 145 pounds or so as a young man — had a forgettable career fighting professionally as a welterweight. He had a record of five victories, seven losses and a draw, according to the BoxRec website. By his own account, he fought 22 times and may have won 18 of those bouts.

Credit Associated Press \n  Duva opened a Paterson-based trucking company to support his family when he quit fighting, but he was not prepared to forsake the boxing world. After completing his deliveries to Manhattan’s garment district, he went to Stillman’s Gym on Eighth Avenue, near Madison Square Garden, to watch legendary trainers like Ray Arcel and Whitey Bimstein handle their fighters while managers concocted deals on pay phones. Duva opened a gym above a theater in Paterson and signed up fighters, sold his trucking business in the early 1960s, then worked as a bail bondsman and was the president of a Teamsters local. In the 1970s, he began promoting fights at Ice World in Totowa, N.J. His son Dan formed Main Events, in Totowa in 1978, soon after graduating from Seton Hall Law School. Two years later, when the United States boycotted the Moscow Olympics, Main Events signed Johnny Bumphus, a future junior welterweight champion — the first recruit in its quest to find talented amateurs. The Duva family’s big break came when Main Events won promotional rights to the Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns welterweight unification title fight in Las Vegas in September 1981. (Leonard held the World Boxing Council title; Hearns the World Boxing Association’s.) \nAdvertisement In arranging the deal, Lou Duva received considerable financial help from Shelly Finkel, a rock promoter, beginning their promotional alliance. \nAdvertisement In 1984, Main Events signed Holyfield, Taylor, Whitaker, Breland and Tyrell Biggs off the Olympic team. \n  The firm continued to thrive, but Dan Duva died of brain cancer in 1996. Four years later, a family feud led to an organizational breakup, with Dan’s widow, Kathy, running Main Events and Lou Duva’s four surviving children creating Duva Boxing. Besides his son Dino, Duva is survived by his daughters, Donna Duva Brooks, Deanne Boorman and Denise MacPhail; 11 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. Duva’s wife, the former Enes Rubio, died in 1986. He was a longtime resident of the Paterson area. Through all the machinations of the fight game and the long string of triumphs and defeats, Duva’s love for boxing endured. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998, and while in his late 80s helped train Chinese amateur boxers brought to the United States with an eye to future promotional chances. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T02:23:56.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
