The public beta update will start rolling out starting today for supported devices. As always, the update will only be rolled out to devices which are enrolled in Android Beta Program.\nThe supported devices include the Google Pixel , Pixel XL , Nexus 5X , Nexus Player , and the Pixel C . Unfortunately, the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 won’t be receiving the Android Nougat 7.1.2 as confirmed by Google earlier. This shouldn’t be a surprise at all since both the devices have already passed the 2-year software support period a while back. Although, both will continue to receive the monthly security patches for one more year.\nGoogle says the update is focused on refinements and it includes a lot of bugfixes as well as many under-the-hood optimizations. In case you have previously enrolled your device in the program, you don’t require to do anything at all; the update will automatically be rolled out to your device in next few days. If not, enroll your eligible device in Android Beta Program here . Alternatively, you can also update your device manually by grabbing the factory images for your device from here .\nThe update changelog has not yet been disclosed by Google, though a release note posted on the Android Developers site for the Android 7.1.2 update outlines some of the known bugs in the beta update. That include Quick Settings issue on the Pixel C, occasional UI hangs, WiFi stability issues, screen turning black during the transition from boot animation to setup wizard and more.\nAs for when we will see the final release, Google says they’re expecting to release final build of Android 7.1.2 in “next couple of months.”\nSource: Android Developers Blog ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:31:14.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
