beating his girlfriend to death because he was paranoid she was cheating on him. \nJordan Matthews, 24, who physically and verbally abused student Xixi Bi for months before the ‘relentless and remorseless’ fatal attack, has since been jailed for a minimum of 18 years.\nHunters who accidentally shot one another blamed illegal immigrants Matthews struck Miss Bi, who moved to the UK from China to study aged 15, with dozens of blows after seeing what he wrongly believed to be a message from Tinder on her phone.\nMiss Bi, also 24, suffered 41 injuries including massive bruising and multiple fractures in the prolonged assault that started at 1.30am on August 19 last year at their flat in Llandaff, Cardiff, South Wales.\nBy 8.30am she had collapsed due to her injuries, which included a broken jaw and ribs – only then did Matthews call 999.\n&&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nXixi Bi was brutally beaten to death by Matthews (Picture: Wales News Service) Matthews, of Cardiff, pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denied murder, but when doctors examined Miss Bi’s body they found evidence of nine previous rib fractures and a healing jaw fracture – all inflicted by Matthews.\nBruises from the fresh injuries covered at least a third of her body and were so extensive one paramedic thought she had been dead for some time, the court heard.\nPeru Two Michaella McCollum hits the beach for some informal unposed bikini photos Matthews’ claim he had not intended to hurt Miss Bi was dismissed by a jury who found him guilty of murder.\nSentencing at Cardiff Crown Court, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies said the assault was the ‘tragic culmination’ of physical and verbal abuse over a number of months.\nShe said of Miss Bi’s inability to speak out about what was happening to her, even while in hospital with injuries inflicted by Matthews: ‘Nothing better demonstrates the fear that you engendered in this educated and intelligent young woman than her inability to tell of your abusive conduct.’\nAdding: ‘You lied and lied again in order to attempt to exculpate yourself from the overwhelming evidence which was that during the early hours of August 19 2016 your relentlessly and remorselessly inflicted physical injury upon a defenceless young woman.’\nXixi’s family say they have lost their heart (Picture: Wales News Service) Matthews and Miss Bi met in April 2015, when he was unemployed.\nThe court heard how Xixi, the daughter of wealthy parents in China, provided him with a home, clothing, and even a car.\nMrs Justice Davies described how as the months went on, Xixi become quieter, thinner and more withdrawn and how neighbours heard Matthews shouting at her.\nPeggy, 96, has been volunteering at a homeless shelter for 80 years They told the court they heard him say things such as: ‘I don’t want to do this, I’ve got to punish you for what you have done’ and: ‘If you don’t suck my dick I’m going to hit you.’\nMiss Bi was seen to have black eyes and was forced to resit a year of her course after missing deadlines.\nRepresenting Matthews, Christopher Henley QC said Matthews was ‘sincerely sorry’, adding: ‘He misses her, he loved her, but he accepts that the way he treated her was atrocious.’\nMore: UK Cressida Dick becomes first female

Matthews’ mother said there had been ‘serious domestic violence’ in his childhood.\nMr Bi said in a victim impact statement, read out in court, that his sister had been due to run their family’s company.\nHe said: ‘She was intelligent and had the whole world in front of her. All this taken from her, due to Jordan Matthews and his selfish and violent attack on my sister. The heart has been ripped out of our family.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:56:10.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
