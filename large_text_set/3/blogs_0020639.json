The biggest difference, however, is that Clips can be used to import videos up to 30 minutes long to create a final product that’s up to an hour in length. You’ll then have the facility to share your creation to any supported application.\nObviously, Apple is hoping that you’ll send your clips to friends using iMessage, so it’s baked a face recognition algorithm into the application, which automatically recognizes people in the video from your device’s contacts and lets you forward it to them with a click of a button.\nVine all over again Overall, it’s a pretty neat concept, but it’s not entirely new. The firm was first reported to be developing the application last summer. That said, we can’t wait to see how it turns out when it eventually launches. Although, we have a feeling the internet will once again be flooded by short, irritating videos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:33:24.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
