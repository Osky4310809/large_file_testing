USA TODAY Sports Louisville's Rick Pitino and Kentucky's John Calipari are archrivals but in a similar neighborhood in terms of compensation. (Photo: USA TODAY Sports photo illustration) 1   \nAlready a fixture in football at public universities, the $7 million coach has now come to men’s basketball. \nUniversity of Louisville coach Rick Pitino and University of Kentucky coach John Calipari are both above $7.4 million in USA TODAY Sports’ annual survey of the compensation paid to coaches whose schools participated in the 68-team NCAA tournament. \nCalipari is making more than $7.1 million in basic compensation from the university, Pitino nearly $5.1 million. Both also reported having had significant income from outside sources that was related to their employment by the schools. Pitino’s non-university amount included $2.25 million that he received under a personal-services contract with Adidas, the shoe-and-apparel company that outfits Louisville’s teams. What NCAA Tournament coaches make: Salary database \nDuke’s Mike Krzyzewski has been credited with more than $7 million three times in recent years on the private school’s federal tax records, but those filings involve a separate way of reporting compensation figures. \nThough Calipari is now making more from his school on an annual basis than are each of the two most highly paid football coaches, Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh and Alabama’s Nick Saban, football coaches are better paid on the whole. At least 36 football coaches were making more than $3 million this past season. Including coaches whose teams didn’t make the NCAA tournament, there were less than half that number at that level in basketball this season. \nMORE ON COACHES COMPENSATION: \nThe missing numbers in Roy Williams' record book \nBut one of those basketball coaches is at a school without a football team, Wichita State’s Gregg Marshall. He is making $3 million from the university this season, and that amount will jump to $3.5 million annually beginning in 2018. \nCalipari — who recently signed a two-year contract extension that runs through March 2024 — is scheduled to see his pay from Kentucky continue climbing during the next few years to $8 million a year. It is set to remain at that amount for each of the deal’s final six years, although Kentucky has agreed to review it in June 2022. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. No. 1: Rick Pitino, Louisville: $7,769,200 – Pitino’s pay is boosted by more than $2.7 million in self-reported outside income that included $2.25 million from a personal services contract with Adidas. He’ll also get a $750,000 retention payment for remaining the school’s head coach on March 31. Jamie Rhodes, USA TODAY SPorts No. 2: John Calipari, Kentucky: $7,435,376 – Calipari’s basic compensation from the school increased from last season by a previously scheduled $600,000. It is set to go up by another $350,000 next season. He reported nearly $300,000 in outside income. Jim Brown, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 3: Mike Krzyzewski, Duke: $5,550,475 – Because Duke is a private school, Krzyzewski’s total is the one reported on the school’s most recently available federal income tax return, which covers pay for the 2014 calendar year, including benefits and bonuses. Duke’s return stated that $492,500 of Krzyzewski’s total had been reported as deferred compensation on prior years’ returns. Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports No. 4: Bill Self, Kansas: $4,932,626 – Self’s compensation has been virtually unchanged since 2012, when he received a roughly $1.3 million increase. Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 5: Tom Izzo, Michigan State: $4,251,751 – Slight rises in both his pay from the school and from outside sources are resulting in Izzo’s total compensation increasing by about $100,000 compared to what he made last season. At his pay level, that’s an increase of slightly less than 2.5%. Mike Carter, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 6: Bob Huggins, West Virginia: $3,590,000 – Huggins’ pay increased from last season’s by a previously scheduled $250,000. It’s set to go up by another $175,000 during his 2017-18 contract year. He remains eligible for a $25,000 bonus for a regular-season win over Kansas – which he’s gotten four times. Ben Queen, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 7 John Beilein, Michigan: $3,370,000 – The terms of a new agreement that began in October 2015 are taking full effect during a contract year that ends April 15. The result is a pay increase from the school of nearly $530,000 over what Beilein received in 2015-16. Mike Carter, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 8: Gregg Marshall, Wichita State: $3,035,500 – Working under a seven-year, rolling contract, Marshall saw his outside income decline by about $95,000 in the past year. But he’ll make that up soon, as his basic pay from the school is set to increase by $500,000 not long after the 2017-18 season. Jeff Curry,USA TODAY Sports No. 9: Scott Drew, Baylor: $2,818,811 – According to the private school’s most recently available tax records, Drew received more than $2.55 million in base compensation and $163,000 in bonus pay during the 2014 calendar year. Brett Rojo, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 10: Buzz Williams, Virginia Tech: $2,655,000 – The school’s huge investment in Williams began paying dividends this season as the Hokies made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2007. Williams’ predecessor, James Johnson, was making less than $640,000 from the school in his final season, 2013-14. Michael Thomas Shroyer, USA TODAY Sports No. 11: Dana Altman, Oregon: $2,651,000 – Altman received a new seven-year contract and a $650,000 raise after leading the Ducks to the Elite Eight last season. This season, they reached the Final Four for the first time since 1939. Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports No. 12: Steve Alford, UCLA: $2,644,000 – After last season, when the Bruins went 15-17, Alford renounced a one-year contract extension, through April 2021, that he’d been given in September 2014. He is not scheduled for any future pay increases. Gary A. Vasquez,USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 13: Sean Miller, Arizona: $2,610,000 – Miller’s compensation for this contract year is more than $2 million lower than it was for last year because he is not vesting further in a lucrative longevity fund. However, that vesting is scheduled to resume during his 2017-18 contract year. Casey Sapio, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 14: Mark Turgeon, Maryland: $2,577,054 – Turgeon received a new seven-year contract that was announced in late October 2016, months after the Terrapins’ first NCAA tournament round-of-16 appearance since 2003. The deal resulted in a pay increase of more than $200,000 and it calls for annual increases of 5%. Joseph Maiorana, USA TODAY Sports No. 15: Jay Wright, Villanova: $2,540,958 – The private school’s most recently available tax records showed that $2.47 million of Wright’s compensation for the 2014 calendar year was reported as base compensation.
