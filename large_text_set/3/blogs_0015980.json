If not for your mental health, then for your physical safety. \nTake this lesson from the 32-year-old British man who recently died of accidental electrocution while charging his iPhone in the bath. According to the Daily Mail , Richard Bull plugged his iPhone charger into an extension cord and placed the phone on his chest while relaxing in the water. He was electrcuted when the device made contact with the water. \nInvestigators believe his death was an accident, not a suicide, the report notes. The incident happened at the man's home in December 2016 while he was getting ready for a Christmas party, but is just coming to light now following an investigation. \nThe tragedy is a stark reminder that seemingly \"innocuous devices\" like smartphones \"can be as dangerous as a hairdryer in a bathroom,\" the coroner wrote in his report, according to the Daily Mail . The coroner is now planning to write Apple a note recommending that Cupertino attach warnings to its devices about this risk. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

There were also reportedly burns on his right hand. \nUnfortunately, this isn't the first time someone has died of electrocution while using an iPhone. In 2013, a Chinese woman was killed by an electric shock while answering a call on her iPhone 5 while it was charging.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:51:01.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
