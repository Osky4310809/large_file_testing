Two passengers spotted Scott crossing Terminal 2, where the heinous attack unfolded Friday, and approached him Saturday morning. The two travelers, who were about to go on a cruise, told the Miami Herald they had tried without success to find their four bags, which were part of 20,000 items left behind during a mass evacuation the previous day. Scott liaised with Delta to make sure the bags would be sent to the passengers at their first port of call. The governor, who has visited survivors of the attack, also expressed hope that tourists would return to Florida in the future and declared safety a priority. Scott has met with survivors of the attack, some of whom are still in surgery and fighting for their lives. ‘We love our tourists and we want them to keep coming back,’ Scott said Saturday morning at the airport, according to the Miami Herald . ‘The number one priority for our state is safety.’ Class act. That’s the kind of compassion and dedication that you look for in a governor. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Fort Lauderdale as they try to pick up the pieces.
