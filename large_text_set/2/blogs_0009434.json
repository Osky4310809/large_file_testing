That’s the reason why we don’t have a sticker price to report for now. \nChanges to the 208 GTi facelift include the same integrated front grille and bumper design as the standard 208 facelift that was launched here last month (the new look is much neater to these eyes), along with new LED tail lights with triple “lion claw” signatures. The GTi-specific headlights (with C-shaped LED indicators) and cool 17-inch “Carbone” two-tone alloys are unchanged, while the red highlights on the grille is now a simple stripe inset below the number plate. No lack of shiny bits, that’s for sure. \nInside, the 208’s distinctive dashboard layout gets red-themed sporty cues to set the GTi apart. The “gradient” red decorative trim of old has been replaced by full piano black items, with the door handles gaining the same red stripe in the middle as on the pre-facelift hardcore 30th Anniversary Edition , which is now called the “208 GTi by Peugeot Sport”. \nPeugeot’s rival to the Ford Fiesta ST and Renault Clio RS gets a bump in power and torque. The Prince 1.6 litre THP turbocharged four-cylinder engine has been retained, but now gets 8 hp and 25 Nm more, for a total of 208 hp (as printed on the engine cover) and 300 Nm of torque. A six-speed manual transmission remains the sole gearbox option, which is good news for fans of the stick. \nThe pre-facelift 208 GTi was launched with a long list of equipment in late 2013, and from what we can see, kit levels have largely been maintained, save for the obvious deletion of the panoramic glass roof. Also out are front parking sensors and the auto parking function. The tyre model change from Michelin Pilot Exalto 2 to the Pilot Sport 3 is enforced – the former is no longer in production. \nGiven the ringgit’s current strength (or rather the lack of) against major currencies, it would be quite an achievement if official distributor Nasim manages to price this car around RM140k, which was the pre-facelift’s launch price.
