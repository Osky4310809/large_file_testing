However it is increasingly clear that a large number of surgeries are not providing proper out of hours care - and that patients are suffering as a result because they are then forced to go to A&E . \n“It is also bad for hospitals which then face additional pressure on their services. That’s why ministers are calling on GPs to deliver on their commitments - while introducing reforms to deliver in the interests of patients.” \nMinisters say they have been shown evidence that some GP surgeries are failing to tell patients about extended hours appointments or ensure that they are at times that patients want. Number 10 says this means that some patients are left with little option but to go to A&E.
