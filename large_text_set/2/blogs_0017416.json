However, since his move to Manchester United, we have new reason to suspect the big Swede is more machine than man. \nThe amount of football he plays. \nZlatan is 35 years old. At that age, many top players are already enjoying retirement. However, Zlatan is not only still playing at the very top level - he is currently playing more games than any other footballer in the Premier League. (Photo: Matthew Peters) Zlatan gets ready for Saint-Etienne - yet another match for the football machine (Photo: Jan Kruger) \nThe United striker is currently preparing for the second of the Red Devils' Europa League against Saint-Etienne. If he appears, the match in France will be Zlatan's 37th match of the season. \nFor a man in his mid-thirties to have played that many games by mid-February is remarkable - but his tally of 36 appearances looks even more astonishing when compared to that of every other top-flight player in England: Most games played this season Premier League players, all comps \nIncredibly, only Southampton's Nathan Redmond can match Zlatan for appearances this season. \nHowever, the 35 year-old United man still beats the 22 year-old whippersnapper when it comes to minutes played. Zlatan has 3,030 minutes under his belt, while Redmond has only been on the pitch for 2,616 minutes this season. \nIn fact, even if you look at time played for all Premier League players - rather than simple appearances - Zlatan still comes third on the list, behind only Leicester's Wes Morgan and Southampton keeper Fraser Forster: Most minutes played this season Premier League players, all comps \nGiven these amazing numbers, it's no winder Zlatan is currently getting praise from a whole host of different Man United legends. \nFormer United captain Steve Bruce sees similarities the current United No9 and one of United's most famous No7s. \n\"For 35, Ibrahimovic really is quite remarkable,\" Bruce told Betsafe. \"He still has that hunger and desire to be the best player. He has that arrogance and way about him. (Photo: Getty Images) \n\"The similarities between him and Cantona are scary. Both are born winners. You can see he's a bit of a talisman for every team he plays for, and there's no talk about rest at his age, he's in terrific shape.\" \nIt's a similarity Ryan Giggs also sees. \n\"I think there's similarities because of that confidence they have in their own ability and the goals that they have scored,\" Giggs said. \n\"It didn't faze Eric or Ibrahimovic coming to United and being the No 1 player. (Photo: PA) \n\"Even when they are playing well and getting all the adoration, they don't get carried away. \n\"It's their job and you can see that he (Ibrahimovic) is a good professional, he is always fit and at his age to play centre-forward and to produce the goals he is producing is unbelievable.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:22:37.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
