Certainly not.\nSEE ALSO: How Donald Trump's own tweets could be his undoing\nSpeaking at a rally in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday, Trump alluded to a terrorism incident in Sweden as part of his argument for implementing his immigration ban. He ticked off a list of places affected by terrorism, taking aim at Europe's immigration policies.\n\"You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this,\" Trump said.\nBut Trump conceded what his statement was in reference to what he saw on Fox News . It was possibly a segment on a documentary about immigration and crime in Sweden , which aired on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on the channel Friday.\nMy statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017\nTrump's high consumption of television is something that's been noted by the media, so much so that aides are trying to get him to watch less.\nResponding to Trump's tweet, Sweden's embassy in the U.S. is very, very eager to help educate his government on how it deals with immigrants.\nWe look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies. https://t.co/x5G3euOWRh\n— Embassy of Sweden US (@SwedeninUSA) February 19, 2017\nOuch. And there's sure plenty of people looking forward to the lesson too.\n@SwedeninUSA @realDonaldTrump Good luck with that. And keep it to one page with lots of pictures. He gets easily confused.\n— John Aravosis (@aravosis) February 20, 2017\nOh, @SwedeninUSA . The current administration isn't even informed on American immigration and integration policies. https://t.co/eOXiYVNAHE\n— shauna (@goldengateblond) February 20, 2017\n@SwedeninUSA We the people of the US are truly sorry Sweden was dragged into Trump's #alternativefacts . Please know he speaks alone.\n— Amyzing (@deangelis28) February 20, 2017\nSwedish Embassy had to shade Trump because he made up a flat out lie about an attack last night in Sweden that didn't happen @SwedeninUSA\n— Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) February 20, 2017\nJust surreal.\nBONUS: This quiet and discrete breast pump could be a game changer for many moms.", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/wWJr91eR.jpg", "https://twitter.com/SwedeninUSA/status/833462568257732612", "https://t.co/x5G3euOWRh", "http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/Vn17J/in-english-this-happened-in-sweden-friday-night-mr-president", "https://t.co/eOXiYVNAHE", "http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/donald-trump-media-diet-tv-habits", "https://twitter.com/FoxNews", "https://twitter.com/goldengateblond/status/833482080172412928", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://twitter.com/deangelis28/status/833466338655993856", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/alternativefacts?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/KaivanShroff/status/833473450253701121", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/61415760238042f2ad7bc38acc2f468c/trumps-bridge-building-eclipsed-false-voter-fraud-claim", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/833435244451753984", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/02/18/did_fox_news_segment_lead_trump_to_believe_there_was_a_terror_attack_in.html", "https://twitter.com/aravosis/status/833531922982772737", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/wWJr91eR.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/SwedeninUSA"], "published": "2017-02-20T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:02:47.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
