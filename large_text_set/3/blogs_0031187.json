The aggressive front end is dominated by the large Nissan signature \"V-motion\" grille, which provides enhanced engine cooling (versus the previous GT-R design) and features a matte chrome finish and an updated mesh pattern. The reinforced hood helps enhance stability during high speed driving. The use of adhesive bonding (in addition to spot welding) helps increase body shell rigidity for mounting of the NISMO-tuned suspension. \nThe Nissan GT-R Track Edition's sporty red and black interior features standard leather-appointed Recaro® front bucket seats. The simplified switch layout includes just 11 switches, along with an 8-inch capacitive touch panel monitor. The standard steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters allow drivers to make mid-turn gear changes without taking their hands off the wheel. \nThe Nissan GT-R Track Edition also includes standard NissanConnectSM with Navigation, Mobile Apps and Services, which allows users to use a smartphone to remotely lock or unlock the car doors, activate the alarm, summon emergency services or track the car if it is stolen (SiriusXM® subscription required, sold separately). Also standard is a RearView Monitor. \nLike the 2017 GT-R Premium, the GT-R Track Edition offers a 565 horsepower hand-assembled twin-turbo VR38DETT 3.8-liter V6 engine. Torque is rated at 467 lb-ft. A Titanium exhaust system is standard. All GT-R engines are hand-assembled from beginning to end in a special clean room by specially trained technicians known as Takumi, a process similar to racing powerplant construction. An aluminum plate is added to the front of each engine showing the name of the Takumi engine craftsman. \nThe standard Bose® audio sound system includes Active Noise Cancellation and Active Sound Enhancement technologies to filter out unwanted noise and retain excitement during spirited driving. Acoustic glass and targeted sound dampening help reduce the intrusion of wind and road noise into the GT-R Track Edition cabin. \nThe 2017 GT-R Track Edition's refined powerplant is backed by an advanced paddle-shifted sequential 6-speed dual clutch transmission, which can be driver selected to shift at race car-like speeds. High performance differential oil, used in GT-R motorsports competition, is standard. \nAll 2017 Nissan GT-Rs are built on an exclusive Premium Midship platform, which enables the use of the unique independent rear transaxle ATTESA E-TS all-wheel drive system. This system places the transmission, transfer case and final drive at the rear of the vehicle, optimizing weight distribution and maximizing handling capability.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T18:47:37.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
