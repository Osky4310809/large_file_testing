Like every week, just when celebs seem to be doing the right then, they just seem to mess it up! My biggest example for the same is Deepika Padukone and even Malaika Arora. You wouldn’t believe the number of hot looks they pulled off in the week actually gave me hopes! In fact, I was about to take them in the best dressed list but then they did something unthinkable. Earlier I had put up a best dressed list. In the list there were Kareena Kapoor Khan, Kangana Ranaut, Alia Bhatt and Shraddha Kapoor. It’s not really a big shock that these names are in the best dressed list. I always see them make heads turn with kickass outings. Mostly they opt for chic ensembles, which really works in their favour. However, it is only occasional when they tend to go a little too overboard with their style game. That is something I can make peace with. What I can’t make peace with is the fact that the names have been recurring. \nAlthough Malaika is a newb in this list. Nevertheless, let’s just hope it’s the last time we see her in this list. I really like her fashion game because the diva always manages to pull off almost every damn look with precision. But again, as I’ve said earlier, mistakes happen. Anyway, you folks can scroll below and check out the worst dressed this week. ( ALSO READ – Kareena Kapoor Khan, Kangana Ranaut, Alia Bhatt – take a look at the best-dressed celebs of the week ) \nDeepika Padukone Outfit: Gucci pjyama suit Bag: Celine Phantom \nI’ve already ranted about this look earlier. The disastrous pyjama suit has badly been styled with the trench coat as well as black pumps! Although the diva looks really good, the outfit is a major turn off. \nMalaika Arora Outfit: Isabel Marant Bag: Yves Saint Laurant \nI can still make peace with the tassels on her dress but I definitely don’t like the boots she has matched with the outfit. It just doesn’t go well with each other. Also, what’s with the amount of blush on the face? In case you didn’t know, she made for a fiery diva as she bought strawberries recently, wearing a grey bodycon dress. \nKriti Sanon Outfit: Roseroom Couture Shoes: Aldo \nKriti really needs to upgrade her wardrobe. There’s hardly any good stuff for occasions. Either that or she needs to fire her stylist because clearly, she’s not doing a good job with her outings. This set of separates is simply dull with no spunk. \nNeha Dhupia Outfit: Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla gown \nDo I even have to begin talking about this? The bow is so big that it actually reminds me of Deepika’s rose gown debacle at Star Screen Awards. The bow is tacky to another level. Don’t you think? \nPooja Hegde Outfit: Anita Dongre \nI’ll directly go to what’s wrong about this outfit. The top is very unflattering and so is her makeup. Although I really liked the skirt, the top was very boring and as you can see, there was too much of makeup that didn’t really look impressive. Also, the tassel earrings made this look way too matching than it should’ve. \nWhat are your thoughts on this, BollywoodLifers? Tell us in the comments box below.
