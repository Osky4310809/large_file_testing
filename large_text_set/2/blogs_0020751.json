MKnighton/Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing/Getty Images\nGmail is still one of the best ways to send and receive emails.\nIts functionality may be simple, and its interface plain, but it gets the job done.\nWhile it may seem basic, there is another level to Gmail.\nThere are several extensions, settings, and labs you can play around with to make Gmail go one step further from simple.\nHere are four Gmail tricks you'll actually use.\nView As: One Page Slides Justin Kerby/Boomerang 1. Send emails later The Boomerang Chrome Extension allows you to write an email now and send it later  —  even if you're not online.\nIt schedules your emails to be sent at a specific time set by you. It can also be used to notify you when you need to respond to certain emails.\nInstead of getting lost in your inbox, you can send emails away for a specific period of time, and have them return when you're ready to address them.\nIt's a great tool for scheduling and reminders. Download it today .\nJustin Kerby/Gmail 2. Undo emails sent Have you ever accidentally hit “reply all”, and realized it seconds later? We all have.\nFortunately, Gmail now allows you to un-send a sent email. Within Gmail's settings, there is an option to “Enable Undo Send.” You can then set your emails to be undone within 5–30 seconds of sending them. You won't use it much  —  but when you do, it's a lifesaver.\nJustin Kerby/Ugly Email 3. Track who's tracking you Email trackers are everywhere. Companies and individuals alike want to keep tabs on when you're opening their emails, and how many times you're opening them.\nThe good news is, you can take back control. UglyEmail is a Chrome extension that works within Gmail, showing you who is tracking emails sent to you. It's a great way to stay ahead of the game.\nJustin Kerby/Rapportive 4. Connect with Your Contacts Another extension, Rapportive allows you to connect with your Gmail contacts on LinkedIn with the click of a button. It works so well, LinkedIn bought the product in 2012 for about $15 million.\nJustin Kerby is the Founder of Cave Social , a digital marketing agency based in South Florida.
