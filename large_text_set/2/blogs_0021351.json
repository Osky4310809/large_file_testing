It happens to the best of us, and yes, that includes celebrities — on Oscar night . Exhibit A: Emma Roberts and Michelle Williams. \nHere’s Michelle, our forever style-crush, looking as gamine as ever, dolled up to represent Manchester by the Sea nomination in Louis Vuitton. Could she be more darling? (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) \nAnd here’s Emma Roberts looking straight fire/Old Hollywood glam in Armani Privé. Totally stunning, not to mention sustainable. (Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic) \nOk, while they’re not exactly the same, the similarities are pretty hard to miss. Black up top with deep-v decolletage action, cream and delicate embellishment situation on bottom. But here’s the thing: they’re BOTH GORGE. So while we feel for these two ladies, knowing the frustration of having another woman show up looking fantastic in your look, we’re gonna focus on the positives. They both look amazing, clearly both have excellent taste and hey, they’re at the Oscars . Life ain’t so bad. Especially when you can laugh off things like this. Looking good, ladies. Both of you. \nWhat look is your fave so far?
