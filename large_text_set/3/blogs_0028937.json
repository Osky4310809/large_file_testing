Walter Reed Middle School’s white population increased heavily over the past few years, leading to the budget cut announcement. \nParents remained unhappy with the announcement, citing concerns for their children’s future education. \n“When your class sizes are getting larger and you’re taking resources away from students, I mean as parents, you do want your kid to go out to college,” parent Rosemary Estrada told ABC 7. \nThe policy stems from a 1970s court decision aimed at fighting segregation in schools. \n“Under a court-ordered integration program that has been in place since 1978, PHBAO schools qualify for smaller class sizes and additional positions. When a school no longer qualifies for PHBAO status, fewer positions are funded,” Local District Northeast superintendent Linda Del Cueto explained in a letter sent home to parents about the decision. \nDistrict officials are trying to lessen the effect on students by spending based on the size of the student body. The school was able to keep their librarian, nurse and counselor for the 2017-2018 year, Del Cueto said in the letter. \n“Thankfully we’re going to keep our librarian,” Sheila Edmiston, a parent, said . “We’re going to keep our nurse, but we may lose a few teachers, but not as many as we once thought.” \nSend tips to [email protected] .
