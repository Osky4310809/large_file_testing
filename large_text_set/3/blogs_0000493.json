They have been saying things that were not true.” \nHe continued, “Flynn was not honest with Vice President Pence, and now many members of the senate judiciary committee think that Senator Sessions — now Attorney General Sessions — was not honest with them. That’s fake news.” \nWatch the clip above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:18:21.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
