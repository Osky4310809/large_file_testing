who could replace Neymar, the fee Leicester want for Riyad Mahrez, and Eden Hazard’s set for a new deal. \nCatch up on the latest transfer links in Rumour Mill! \nMESSI APPROVES DYBALA TRANSFER \nLionel Messi has approved of Barcelona’s plan to sign Juventus’ Paulo Dybala , which would open the door for Neymar to move to PSG or the Premier League, according to Corriere dello Sport. \nAfter Barca’s last-gasp escape against PSG in the Champions League, and with Real Madrid leading the La Liga title battle, bosses of the Calatan giant reportedly want to shake-up the forward line. \nJuve striker Dybala is reportedly their top target, and the player reportedly wants a move to the Nou Camp after reportedly rejecting a move a year ago. \nNow there’s also a reported promise of a starting spot for the Argentine at the expense of Neymar, who was linked with a move to the French giant before signing a new five-year deal with Barca.

It comes days after Pochettino signed a bumper new £5.5m-a-year Spurs deal that runs until 2021. \nBarcelona have also announced that they won’t chase Athletic Bilbao manager Ernesto Valverde to take over.

At the end of the season we will see, there will be talks. I’m very happy at Arsenal and in London.” \nWenger said he will make his decision “very soon”, but Ozil and Alexis Sanchez’s future don’t seem any clearer. \nTOTTENHAM TO OFFLOAD JANSSEN \nTottenham haven’t even finished paying off Vincent Janssen’s transfer fee to AZ Alkmaar after he joined the Spurs last summer, but they want to sell him, according to The Mirror.
