I get that and I applaud that,” he told the National Post by phone.\n“But the basic thing that struck me was it seems inappropriate for someone to make a call that feels like censorship (over) what kind of films one should shoot on Crown land.”\nJackson, an Albertan, and members of the production team added that the denial of a shooting permit was depriving the local economy and tourism industry of potentially millions of dollars.\nThe Canadian Rockies and its surrounding landscapes have served as breathless backdrops to countless Hollywood films, including Unforgiven, Brokeback Mountain and Legends of the Fall.\nRelated Movie with aboriginal gang character denied permission to shoot by Parks Canada The film that Jackson is set to star in, Hard Powder, is about a snowplow driver in Colorado, played by action star Liam Neeson, who seeks revenge on a local drug boss after his son is killed.\nAccording to a synopsis published in Variety magazine, the father’s vengeance “sparks a turf war between a Native American mafia boss (played by Jackson) and the Viking, a fastidious gangster who wears Tom Ford suits, is a vegan, drives a Tesla and murders people. This climaxes in a final showdown that leaves almost no one unscathed.”\nThe film’s unit manager, Mark Voyce, who was involved in scouting locations, said the plan was to spend nine days shooting in the region, including at the Chateau Lake Louise resort and the Columbia Icefield.\nThings were moving along until last week, he said. First, Parks Canada raised a concern that certain high-profile landmarks or “iconic images” would be readily identifiable in the film, including Lake Louise.\n“Then about an hour later they phoned and said, ‘Is the rival gang member indigenous?’” Voyce recalled. “We said, ‘yes.’ And they said that is very much a concern of the national parks. They said that there were a number of negotiations in process with Treaty 7 (First Nations) … regarding land claims and they didn’t want to do anything that would eventually offend the First Nations people and affect their position at the bargaining table.”\nVoyce said after word got out about Parks Canada’s decision, some First Nations members reached out to the production crew to say, “ ‘It’s nice they’re thinking about us, but it’s not so nice they’re speaking for us’.”\nPostmedia/File A visitor looks out at a portion of the Columbia Icefield. Anne Many Heads, CEO of the Treaty 7 management corporation, did not respond to messages Thursday. Craig Makinaw, Assembly of First Nations regional chief in Alberta, said he needed more time to study the issue but did offer that it would be nice to see First Nations actors be given more “modern” roles.\nIn a statement to The Canadian Press, Parks Canada confirmed it had issues with the film’s storyline.\n“The Government of Canada is committed to reconciliation and nation-to-nation relationships with indigenous peoples, based on a recognition of rights, respect, co-operation, and partnership,” the statement said.\n“In addition to some administrative details and outstanding documentation, Parks Canada’s commitment to reconciliation and respect for indigenous peoples was an important factor in the agency’s final decision on this matter. Parks Canada maintains the right to refuse applications that are not in line with Parks Canada’s mandate or operational priorities.”\nJackson, 68, noted that while he plays a gangster in the film, he is not necessarily a straight-out bad guy.\n“My character is in the world of gangs, sophisticated gangs, and my son gets killed,” he said. “The storyline here is not about dealing with the gang world. The story here is a guy who lost his son who avenges (the death of ) his son. … Liam’s character is a character who is not a gangster who loses his son. We’re both looking for vengeance against the villain.”\nLyle Aspinall/Postmedia Network Chateau Lake Louise in Alberta, one of the locations Hard Powder's team wanted to shoot. The role is a “refreshing” departure from previous roles, Jackson added. Plus, the film “offers screen time for other First Nations actors to be seen globally on the big screen,” he said.\nMichael Shamberg, the film’s producer, said in an interview that it makes no sense for the federal and provincial governments to offer tax incentives to reel in film companies and then for Parks Canada to deny them access.\n“There’s no basis editorially, environmentally and economically to not have a policy that is welcoming,” he said.\n“The parks system is standing in the way for no reason.”\nShamberg and Voyce said filming will now move to other parts of Alberta and B.C.\n• Email: dquan@postmedia.com | Twitter: dougquan \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:04:51.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
