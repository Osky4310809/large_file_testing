The 128GB storage unit lets you stick a micro-SD or SD card from any camera directly into its body for backup (or CF cards via a USB 3 card reader). Once you download the Gnarbox app on your iOS or Android device and connect it to the Gnarbox, you can edit full-res footage on your phone, too. \nAnd you don’t even need an internet connection—the box has its own wifi hotspot. The Gnarbox dimensions are 5.3” x 3.4”. \nThe company is clearly going after the adventure film market; there are ski and snowboard bros aplenty in the promotional videos. But it’s not just for style—the Gnarbox is built for rugged conditions, even those where you might be off the grid for a period, which could be useful for wilderness documentarians and beyond. \nSome of the features that make this an ideal solution for more turbulent shoots are the Gnarbox's reportedly waterproof, shockproof, and dustproof design, and a 4000mAh battery that lasts for four to six hours on a single charge and allows you to recharge with microUSB. \nThe in-app editing tool allows for basic functions, like in-out points, color correction, cropping, and slow-motion. \nSee a full product tutorial below: \nPre-order yours now for delivery later this month.
