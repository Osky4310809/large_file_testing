Suresh Menon on what made the wicketkeeper batsman one of the calmest cricketers in history. \nDhoni was not only a calm captain himself, he was the cause for calmness in others. \nHe smiled, he showed displeasure, he chatted to bowlers, but while his immediate message was clear, no one could bet on what his thinking was. \nTo catch the cricket fraternity by surprise twice in two years - first while quitting Test cricket , and now when relinquishing captaincy in one-day internationals - is no mean feat. Dhoni quitting Test cricket stuns India \nDhoni read the one-day game better than he did Test cricket, and was India's finest captain in the shorter formats. \nHe led India to victory in three tournaments - T20, World Cup and Champions Trophy - so the record matched his reputation. \nHe tended to let the longer game drift occasionally, and seemed to feel the pressure of not losing his early Tests, something that might have rendered him more defensive once the streak was broken. \nThe shorter formats were different. Image copyright AFP Image caption Dhoni's fitness has never been in doubt \nHe could experiment, even gamble, trusting his finely honed sense of time and place to bring him success. \nWhen he handed the ball to rookie Joginder Sharma in the final of the inaugural World Twenty20 final a decade ago, there might have been a collective gasp around the country. \nYet Sharma claimed the last Pakistan wicket, and as an unintended consequence, the face of cricket was changed forever. The IPL was born , as India, Twenty20 deniers became Twenty20 obsessed. \nDhoni, one of the greatest finishers in the modern game, got his timing right once again, pre-empting the inevitable media speculation about his future following the sustained successes of skipper Virat Kohli. Fitness not a problem \nThe only question to be answered, of course, was whether Dhoni saw himself in the 2019 World Cup team. \nHe would be 39 then, but fitness was unlikely to be the problem. The concern was over the fact that given India's fixtures list heavy on Test cricket, he might feel rusty with bat in hand. \nAlready in recent matches, his legendary finishing abilities had let him down occasionally, and there were few chances to get match fit. \nThis meant that he could not afford failure, and had to make an impact every time he went out to bat. Youngsters like wicketkeeper batsman Rishabh Pant were beginning to look match-ready. It was thus a pragmatic call, to give up captaincy and focus on batting and try to rediscover the freedom and form that made him one of the greats. \nFor Dhoni is nothing if not practical. Image copyright AFP Image caption Dhoni was India's finest captain in the shorter formats \nNot for him the romance and layered philosophy of the game; he was simple without being simplistic, straightforward without being naive, and knows his mind best. \nThese qualities served him well as captain, they serve him well as a person. \nThe long chat he had with the chairman of selectors, MSK Prasad, during the semi-final of the ongoing domestic Ranji Trophy tournament might have convinced him. Perhaps the decision to step down as the one-day captain was made before the chat. \nDhoni's place in history is assured, and not just as a player and captain. \nHe was leader of a talented group of players which emerged from non-traditional areas. \nThere was a historical inevitability about this. India's early captains were the local royals. Then came those who worked for the royals like Lala Amarnath and Vijay Hazare . \nThen came the middle-class salary-earning city-bred captains ( Ramchand, Contractor , Wadekar ), with Tiger Pataudi the exception in the 1960s. \nDhoni's arrival was a testimony to the reach of televised cricket. \nYoungsters had been fired by the 1983 World Cup win by Kapil Dev's India. Suddenly towns like Bharuch, Aligarh, Jalandhar, Palarivattom, Quilon, Rae Bareilly, Khorda and Kodagu began producing international cricketers.   Dhoni led India to its second World Cup win in 2011 \nDhoni was eight when Sachin Tendulkar made his debut, yet within months of playing under Dhoni, the senior man was saying, \"I am delighted at the way Dhoni conducts himself. He is a balanced guy with a sharp brain. His approach is clear and uncomplicated.\" \nSo clear and uncomplicated that when his immediate predecessor Anil Kumble retired, Dhoni carried him off the field on his shoulders. \nIn Indian cricket, no captain is a hero to his vice captain, and this must rate as one of the great sights on a cricket field. 'A fluke' \nThe simple was best demonstrated when he asked spinner Amit Mishra to bowl the last over on the second day of the Mohali Test against Australia in 2008, and the bowler dismissed Michael Clarke. \nAt the press conference later, Dhoni, praised for his acumen, confessed, \"It was a fluke.\" He was to say later, \"I want a team that can stand before an advancing truck.\" \nIt was a captaincy mantra that he followed, and which saw India rise to the top in both Test and ODI rankings. \nWhether Dhoni was bowing to the inevitable by giving up the captaincy, or merely anticipating the future by a fortnight, the fact remains that once again he goes out on his own terms. \nHe led in 199 matches, winning 110, a figure second only to Allan Border's 165. His 41 wins in Twenty20 are the best by any captain. \nThe transition, as in Test cricket, will be smooth.   Dhoni is one of world's richest sportspeople \nVirat Kohli is ready, willing and able. He has said he learnt much under Dhoni, and as he prepares to put together the team for 2019, the younger man has enough time to figure out whether the older fits into his scheme of things. \nBut currently, Dhoni the batsman is a certainty. \nSuresh Menon is the Editor of Wisden India Cricketers' Almanack", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T08:58:20.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
