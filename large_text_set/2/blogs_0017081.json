Though they maintained that they were ‘just friends’ for a while, they later opened up about their relationship. A while ago, the duo got engaged and are all set to tie the knot this year. Talking about her wedding, Bharti told the news agency, PTI: \n“I am very excited for the wedding but more so for all the ceremonies, like ‘mehandi’ and ‘sangeet’. I want to do it all because all throughout the year we work hard and don’t get to do these things… Haarsh is so simple that he doesn’t like all this ‘shor-sharaba’ but I am opposite, I like all these things. He had to agree with me because I am his would be wife… By November-December we will get married. We haven’t decided a date yet because there are a lot of shows we are working on. When I want to get married, I wouldn’t like to do anything for one month before that… I want to just get busy with pre-wedding preparations. Shootings will keep happening but marriage happens only once.” \nTV actress Aashka Goradia is also going to have a winter wedding in December. Just like the previous year, looks like 2017 winter is also going to be all about band baaja and baarat in our telly land. 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:08:12.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
