The piece features a large sailing ship (also known as a galleon) sailing into the sunset, surrounded by doves. The ship is in reference to the name of the venue where the deadly fire occurred, which was at a warehouse space called the Ghost Ship . \n“Honored to paint & dedicate this memorial mural from the tragic Oakland Ghostship fire. For the 36 individuals lost, the survivors, there [sic] family & friends,” Chuck wrote on his Facebook page . \nJetty Extracts, an Oakland company that manufactures medical cannabis extracts, helped cover the cost of the mural. A representative from Jetty Extracts, Lauren Bunde, told KQED that the company’s employees support mural artists and “feel that this kind of artwork is needed now more than ever.”\nAt the same time Chuck was painting the Oakland mural, a fellow muralist was painting another Ghost Ship memorial in San Francisco’s Clarion Alley, according to the Mercury News . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:10:29.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
