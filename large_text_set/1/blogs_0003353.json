The song appears on the Hidden Figures soundtrack.\nActress Janelle Monae, who co-stars in the film , confirmed to TMZ that Burrell would stay home.\n“She’s not performing, absolutely not,” Monae said. She confirmed that just Williams would be performing.\n“And I’ll be there too, so make sure you guys tune in,” she said.\n“I’m a huge advocate for the other,” she added. “I don’t stand for any hate speech, or anything that targets our fellow brothers and sisters.”\n\nBurrell posted a video to Facebook attempting to contextualize her bigotry, blaming God, who has apparently been whispering sweet homophobic nothings in her ears.\nDeGeneres has confirmed that Burrell will not be appearing on her show.\nFor those asking, Kim Burrell will not be appearing on my show.\n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 3, 2017 \n\nWilliams posted to social media, eluding to the video without naming it.\n“I condemn hate speech of any kind,” he wrote.”There is no room in this world for any kind of prejudice. My greatest hope is for inclusion and love for all humanity in 2017 and beyond.”\npic.twitter.com/d8jGbP4TOD \n— Pharrell Williams (@Pharrell) December 31, 2016 \n\nMonae shared Williams’ Instagram post.\nI shouldn’t even have to post this as you guys should already know where I stand but If you do not pls know I unequivocally repudiate ANY AND ALL hateful comments against the LGBTQ community. Actually I’m tired of that label. We all belong to the same community, a shared community called humanity. And today and tomorrow and the next day I will continue to stand with other like minded people who condemn any and all statements and actions that would seek to deny the basic humanity of our fellow brothers and sisters. We cannot sit Idly by nor will we speak silently when we are confronted with such violence against members of our community. I am personally beyond exhausted by the ignorance and bigotry living in some people. At times I want to punch and I want to slap a lot of people when I read and hear the shit that comes out their mouthes !!! I will rejoice when folks stop thinking they ARE GOD, Jesus’ assistant, picking and choosing what “sins” are acceptable in the Bible, and using the Bible as a whip! WE can’t afford anymore tearing down of our shared humanity. My advice: If your religion is causing you to spew out words of hate, judge, or look down on others because of who one loves then you need to change it. And fast. If the religion don’t make you are more loving or better person, ditch it. But what do I know. My hope is that we ALL go into this new year considering for one moment that we don’t have all the answers. My hope is that we become more understanding, less judgmental, more tolerate, and more patient with one another. Including me. HAPPY NEW YEAR. ??? \nA photo posted by Janelle Monáe (@janellemonae) on Dec 31, 2016 at 6:05pm PST \n\nOctavia Spencer, who also stars in the film, shared her agreement with Williams as well.\n“I agree [with Williams]. We are all God’s children equal in his eyes. Hatred isn’t the answer. Isn’t the answer,” she wrote on social media.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:18:39.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
