We’re doing about two-thirds of people,\" director Richard Curtis said when quizzed about the new film. Liam Neeson, Olivia Olsen and Thomas Brodie-Sangster film Red Nose Day Actually (Photo: WENN.com) \nThe two-thirds includes original stars Liam Neeson, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Hugh Grant. \nBut with Alan Rickman's death last year it was unclear whether Emma Thompson would be among the actors reprising their role. \nNow we know, sadly, she won't be back and it's not because the whole thing has been pulled together quickly for Comic Relief. Emma Thompson won't be returning for the Love Actually sequel Read More 37 Love Actually film secrets you probably didn't know \n\"Em isn't in it. She just can't do it,\" director Richard Curtis said. \nLove Actually fanatics have been pondering why the star isn't coming back. It's not because of her Beauty and the Beast press obligations (it's out in a month guys), no, it's for a much sadder reason - she can't face it without Alan Rickman. \nEmma and Alan Rickman were very close, and the actress can't face filming without him. \nJust in case you'd forgotten, or haven't watched the movie a trillion times like everyone else, Rickman played Harry, Karen's husband. He ended up having an affair with his secretary Mia, breaking all our hearts, but mainly Karen's. Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson in Love Actually \nThe pair reunited in the airport and it looked like she decided to stay with him for the sake of their two young children. \nIf you were wondering if there will be a tribute to Rickman too, there won't be one. “You know, dealing with Alan is very complicated,” Richard Curtis told the Press Association. \nLet's hope there's some sort of reference to Rickman, even just to let us know poor Karen is happy with Harry. \nIf not, we'll just pretend they worked through all their issues and lived happily ever after. \nYou can watch the 10-minute sequel on March 24 when it airs during the BBC's Red Nose Day.
