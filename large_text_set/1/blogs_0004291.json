God cares for us and he is sovereign . His Holy Word is sure and his promises are true. Take some time to ease your worries and calm your fears by meditating on these Bible verses for troubled times . Hard Times Bible Verses The LORD is my light and my salvation—whom shall I fear?The LORD is the stronghold of my life—of whom shall I be afraid? (NIV) \nIsaiah 41:10 So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. (NIV) Loss of Home or Job Psalm 27:4-5 One thing I ask of the LORD,this is what I seek:that I may dwell in the house of the LORDall the days of my life,to gaze upon the beauty of the LORDand to seek him in his temple.For in the day of troublehe will keep me safe in his dwelling;he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacleand set me high upon a rock. (NIV)\nGod is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. (NIV) \nPsalm 84:2-4 My soul yearns, even faints,for the courts of the LORD;my heart and my flesh cry outfor the living God.Even the sparrow has found a home,and the swallow a nest for herself,where she may have her young—a place near your altar,O LORD Almighty, my King and my God.Blessed are those who dwell in your house;they are ever praising you.Selah (NIV) \nThe angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him,and he delivers them.Taste and see that the LORD is good;blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.Fear the LORD, you his saints,for those who fear him lack nothing. (NIV) \nPhilippians 4:19 And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus. (NLT) Dealing with Stress Philippians 4:6-7 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus . (NIV) Overcoming Financial Worries Luke 12:22-34 Then Jesus said to his disciples: \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest? \n\"Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. \n\"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. (NIV)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:17:03.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
