They are adamantly opposed, adamantly opposed to [the] economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has,” Bannon said, appearing with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland.\n“It’s going to get worse because he’s going to continue to press his agenda and as economic conditions get better and jobs get better, they’re going to fight. If you think they’re [the media] going to give the country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken. Every day, every day is going to be a fight,” Bannon said.\n“Every day [Trump] tells Reince and I [that ] ‘I promised this to the American people and I’m going to deliver on this.’”\nThe pair heaped praise on Trump, with Bannon calling him the greatest public speaker since William Jennings Bryan, the early-20th century politician and orator.\nSpeaking to a friendly crowd, they also took pains to present themselves as happy warriors working hand in hand to enact Trump’s agenda — an image contrary to leaks from the White House that they are often at each other’s throats fighting for more power.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:11:16.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
