Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said that Mr. Trump’s analogy was “not only an inappropriate comparison on the merits, but it also coarsens our discourse.” “We have a long record of speaking out when both Democrats and Republicans engage in such overheated rhetoric,” he said. “It would be helpful for the president-elect to explain his intentions or apologize for the remark.” On Wednesday, however, Mr. Trump defended the reference in his news conference. Repeating his criticism of the intelligence agencies for allowing the release of what he said was erroneous information about him, he said, “I think it’s a disgrace, and I say that — and I say that, and that’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.” While there is no disputing the brutality of Nazi Germany’s secret police, the Gestapo, Mr. Trump arguably invoked the wrong Germany. Communist East Germany’s ministry for state security, commonly known as the Stasi, became legendary among intelligence agencies for its pervasive network of informants and totalitarian surveillance activities.

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times It is not the first time Mr. Trump has gotten into trouble with Jewish groups while making a political point. Last July, during the heat of the campaign, he posted a tweet with a photo of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, next to an image of the Star of David and a background of $100 bills. The text read, “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!” Critics accused Mr. Trump of playing to Jewish stereotypes — charges that intensified after it emerged that the Star of David imagery had previously appeared on a message board known for anti-Semitism and white supremacy, and on a Twitter account with a history of racially charged comments. Defenders said that the criticism of Mr. Trump was unfair since the six-pointed star was also used as a symbol by many sheriff’s departments. Among Mr. Trump’s most prominent defenders was his son-in-law and now senior adviser, Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew who wrote in his newspaper, The New York Observer, that “ Donald Trump is not anti-Semitic and he’s not a racist .” As evidence of his standing to make such a judgment, Mr. Kushner noted that he was a grandson of Holocaust survivors. He recounted a harrowing story of his grandmother’s sister being dragged out of hiding in a Jewish ghetto in Novogrudok, now in Belarus, in 1941 and later killed by the Nazis. That family history, Mr. Kushner wrote, enabled him to distinguish between “actual dangerous intolerance versus these labels that get tossed around in an effort to score political points.” Mr. Trump, he added, embraced his daughter’s conversion to Judaism before they were married. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story To critics, however, Mr. Kushner’s background made Mr. Trump’s reference even more inexplicable. “How the president-elect could invoke Nazi Germany and denigrate family members of his own son-in-law is beyond the decency of anything we have seen in American politics,” Mr. Goldstein said. \nGet politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .
