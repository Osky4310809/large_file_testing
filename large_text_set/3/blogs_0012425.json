Not because she’s no longer in the spotlight, or getting the attention she desires as the queen of boobs, but more to that, she’s angry because she does not know who to trust any longer. \nFollowing what is playing out in recent times, the soft-spoken actress deemed it fit to let the cat out of the bag, attacking some unnamed actresses for being ungrateful to her kind gestures. \nThe controversial actress took to her Instagram page, Thursday, to expressed her disappointment. *Cossy \nRecounting her story, which she titled, “Ungrateful Delilah” and written like a movie script, Cossy began: “Part 1…once upon a time… In the year 2011… I met a nice businessman… He was so nice…I decided to keep him as a good friend. Because it pays more having good friends than bedmates. \nAnyway, we got so friendly that he asked me for favours. Am not the type you can send errands. So, I made some demands. A Range Rover Sport. And it was accepted. I did all he asked. Then got tired of the protocols. One day, I saw his special… I saw this angelic big fat ass. \nWith tiny waist on top of okada somewhere in Ologolo , Lekki area, I was driving behind this girl and was moved and felt pity . I didn’t know her from Adams never knew she acts…anyway…. I stopped this lady and collected her number. She is so gifted that I went to her house, a flat in a very swampy road she shared with a friend. I asked her if she will love to meet my friend. She was more than happy to go when she heard the money I was offering.” \nShe Continued: “In my own words…. (broke up with my boyfriend over flimsy stuffs! Been thinking why? Now, I know why he left. He promised me a Range Rover Sport for my birthday October 15. Guess what! He can’t met up. Won’t take him back after my birthday chew. Men ,) \nAccording to Cossy, this incident happened about six to seven years ago. \n“This story am telling seems so old because it happened 6/7 years ago….so why now. Hahahahahaa . … I really don’t know how it happened. Was it the ass …was it the lies…or was it juju….I have told close friends in the entertainment industry about this issue . They asked me. Cossy do you do juju? ….. Don’t fight war with fortified juju people!!! …….anyway…. E ji mu Ofo. \nThe hard work I put in… All the protocols I observed. …then just a simple mistake of picking up this girl with huge ass on top of okada messed up my mind. I was bitter for a long time… When I eventually found out the Range Rover was bought …but was given to this fat ass okada girl… So why I no go vex. Oh hope I didn’t loose you there… So Delilah went for the hookup. She was really nice. \nShe dashed me N50,000 from the N400,000 paid to her. I was happy too… Swapping my Rave 4 for a Range…yes, yes I know he can and will keep to his promise. But my good friend Mr? Keep sending me on higher protocol arrangements. My mistake. I should have asked for a well defined job…someone somewhere will be popping in her fat pants…. Talking about lawyers won’t scare me one bit. Because truth can’t be covered.” \nNarrating further, she wrote, “I want to talk about my house. I built it prior to meeting Mr? I was the first actress to own a house then. #facts.. The higher protocols actually taught Mr? Helped out. So they demanded for houses and all…the ones that knew him better (secrets) …blackmail or not..it worked for them. \nThey didn’t talk trash about me…if they did Mr? Will surely tell me, so the secrets are permanently safe with me. The bitchy protocols got me mad…. A very cute smallish Yoruba actress…she has angelic face…hahahha heard a story about her and another …recently… Hmmm no smoke without fire you will say….. Bitch got millions sent to her account from 2011 upwards. S \nhe became a big girl. And is still relevant to Mr? Till date…fortified juju girl with angelic face…. Enjoy your Range …enjoy your house … Produce more block buster but don’t forget I hooked you up to the person that changed your life… Be grateful when you hear Cossy and pray for me in your inner heart. I heard all the trash you told Mr? That’s why am mentioning you now =ØLÞ=ØEÜ. 2nd bitch . \nThe useless one that went to do love. She is just as ugly in xter as Delilah. Can’t keep you for long. Bitch act so crazy… Sent me N100,000 and went to show Mr the bank teller.. That am getting paid for the hookups …it caused a huge rift.. My Range was on shaky grounds…I accepted collecting the N100,000 then I accused him of sending me on plenty protocols. \nThat he should give me a specific “no” before the range comes…=ØGÞ=Ø-Þ seriously…. Bitch 2_Ur mates are utilizing the hookup asking for house and car and your here blocking my range. =Ø8Þ=ØFÞ you deserve a mention for the stress you gave me….but Mentioning your name now will mean reviving your dead career.
