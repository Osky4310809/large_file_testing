The former World War II vet and pilot no doubt used his hard-earned wisdom to catch up to his running rival … \n… and take over his younger competitor in a thrilling photo finish. Rogers finished in 18 seconds. Hemphill: 18.05 seconds. \nAccording to Runner’s World, this is Rogers’ fourth straight USATF Indoor Championship 60-meter race win over Hemphill. \n“I think had I leaned a little bit, I would have won,” Hemphill told Runner’s World after the race. \nThere’s always next year. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:51:56.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
