That is on the physical and the mental side, he has it all. But I think it's his hunger and willingness to learn that will serve him best in his career.\" \nThe England Under-21 international started the FA Cup match against Plymouth Argyle at Anfield as well as the replay at Home Park as he builds up his sharpness following the anterior crucial ligament rupture he suffered in October 2015. \nGomez's rehabilitation process was set back by tendinopathy of the Achilles discovered during the summer. New contract... Signed. @J_Gomez97 commits his long-term future to the club! — Liverpool FC (@LFC) January 27, 2017 \nThe centre-back was also on the bench for the first leg of the League Cup semi-final at Southampton and the Premier League draw away to Manchester United. \nGomez made seven appearances for Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers in 2015-16, operating at left-back, after signing from Charlton Athletic. \n“I feel like I’ve been through so much since I’ve been here already,” he said. \n“Having that year where I was shown a lot of support and so on from the fans, it made me have a good feeling around the club and made it feel like home to me. \n“Putting that behind me, it’s nice to be back in the position to play and trying to do well for the club. I do feel at home here now and that’s obviously why I’m so happy to stay here for a good few more years.” \nKlopp, meanwhile, has revealed that he is unlikely to add to the Liverpool squad before the transfer deadline. \n\"What's your favourite answer?” he responded when asked if there was to be a surprise signing. \n\"I saw a few days ago this show [on TV] only about transfers. And after two minutes, I lost it. I thought 'which club? Which player?' Unbelievable! \n\"If you want, I can say 'yes' and then you can put Liverpool on the screen. But it's not really likely. \n\"It's life and it's always possible. Maybe.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T09:00:24.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
