Astronomical spring began at 6:28 a.m. EDT, Monday. \nFollowing the chilly start to the day, afternoon temperatures rebounded to near 40 F in the interior of northern New England to the 50s from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh. \nSimilar highs will follow on Tuesday. \nThe region’s snow cover will take a hit early this week, causing minor rises on area streams and rivers. Where temperatures drop below freezing at night, residents should be aware of icy spots on untreated roads and sidewalks. \nHowever, winter will fight back at midweek, putting the brakes on the melting snow and forcing residents to pull heavier jackets back out of closets. \nArctic air will first blast into the upper Great Lakes on Tuesday before descending over the Northeast by Wednesday. \nCooler air will spill into the Southeast, but will stop well short of bringing a repeat of the widespread record-breaking and subfreezing temperatures the region endured last week. \nRain and snow showers will accompany the arctic blast into the northern and eastern Great Lakes and northern Appalachians. A period of snow showers and squalls may briefly follow downwind of the Great Lakes. \nWith the arctic air in place, midweek will feel more like January across the Northeast. \nHighs on Wednesday will be 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit below normal with the core of the cold settling over New York state and New England. AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperatures will even be 10-15 degrees lower due to a brisk wind. \n“The lowest temperatures are expected to occur on Thursday morning,” Brown said. \nWidespread lows in the single digits and teens will encompass most of Pennsylvania and into New England. \n“Morning lows this cold are even considered below normal for the typical winter months,” Brown said. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:10:24.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
