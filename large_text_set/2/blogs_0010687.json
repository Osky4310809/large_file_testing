She joined the cadets, who are in the first months of their training, in a personal development lesson and also tried out a flight simulator.\nKate, who took over from Prince Philip as Honorary Air Commandant of the Air Cadets December 2015, was introduced to the recruits of the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Wing Air Training Corps, who are on the camp at RAF Wittering this week.\nJoe Giddens/PA Images via Getty Joe Giddens/PA Images via Getty \nThe last time Kate, 35, visited cadets was at an air show in Gloucestershire last summer when she and Prince William memorably brought along son Prince George .\nKate viewed a single-engine trainer aircraft with the cadets and then took to the controls of the simulator.\nThe RAF Air Cadets comprises the Air Training Corps and the Combined Cadet Force, and promotes practical interest in the aviation world among young men and women. It provides training and encourages the development of life skills including leadership and teamwork. There are 41,000 cadets age 12-19 and 15,000 adult volunteers in the U.K. and abroad.\nJoe Giddens/PA Images via Getty Joe Giddens/PA Images via Getty \nKate and William have many links with the world of flying. They spent the first few years of married life in North Wales, where the prince was a helicopter search and rescue pilot with the RAF. More recently, he has been flying on behalf of the East Anglian Air Ambulance – a post William is set to give up soon as he concentrates on royal duties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:58:57.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
