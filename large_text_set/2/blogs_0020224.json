While it was just the first edition last year, 45,000 people made their way to Paris to talk about all things tech. VivaTech is back again this year on June 15th – June 17th. \nLast year, Mike and I didn’t really know what to expect. But I think it’s fair to say that it was a good conference. As Mike wrote last year, “VivaTech is somewhat akin to a TechCrunch Disrupt, but with a broader mix of corporate and government involvement.” \nVivaTech is co-organized by the advertising company Publicis and major newspaper Les Échos . Last year, 5,000 startups, 6,000 CEOs, 250 investors and 5,000 students were there at some point during the three days of the conference. There were a ton of startup booths as well as eight different stages. \nAnd the team behind VivaTech plans to do just that once again. Everything will be refined as the conference was organized quite quickly last year. So this time, they have more time to prepare and line up their speakers and startups. \nToday at the Élysée Palace, French president François Hollande, French digital minister Axelle Lemaire, Publicis, Les Echos and a bunch of other people introduced the event. It was a big splashy event with around 200 people from the tech ecosystem. \n“The first time I heard about VivaTech, I thought ‘oh no, not yet another big thing,’” Axelle Lemaire said. But she then said that France needed a major tech event to compete with other countries. \n“Today, VivaTech is clearly a success. That’s why they want to do it again, but this time, they’ll pay attention to details to turn it into a community venture so that it can become a major innovation event in France and across the world,” she said. \nShe then listed many of her initiatives as digital minister. I’ve covered many of them on TechCrunch — La French Tech , the French Tech Ticket , the French Tech Visa , the Digital Republic bill , the gender diversity initiative and more. \nFrench president François Hollande spent most of his speech making jokes — he only has a couple of months left as the French president after all. “Maurice Lévy is good when it comes to communication, and I should have talked with him more often,” he said. \n“France is the second European country for startup funding rounds,” Hollande said. “And we’ve been first for the number of transactions since January.” \n“Five years ago, when I heard about [the CES conference] in Las Vegas, there were very few French startups. Today, we’re the second biggest country. And we hope that we can become the first one in a few years — the president of the U.S. is helping us.” \nIt’s weird that French politicians have been fascinated with CES like it’s the ultimate tech event. There are many tech events out there, but somehow CES is the gold standard for ministers , political candidates and French presidents. \nHollande also listed all the reasons why France has become more favorable for startups. Arguably, it has never been easier to create a startup in France, and he hopes that the next French president is going to follow the same path. img_1166", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:16:22.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
