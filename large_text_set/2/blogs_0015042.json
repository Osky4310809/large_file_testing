He told ABC (h/t Sport 's Mar Bianchi ): \"All my fights with Cristiano were because of the press. If people only knew how much I respect [Ronaldo]. I will repeat it to make myself clear: I respect [Ronaldo]. Everyone tells me what a fantastic professional he is. As for CR7, it’s different, he was my rival and I had to compete with him.\" The 33-year-old continued: \nWhen I said he always wanted the limelight, that when you win you are going to be the star but when you lose they will go for you, I said it in a very respectful way. \nAnd I think the same of [Lionel] Messi or Neymar. But my thoughts were not negative. What happens is that the press sold them differently, saying that I had spoken ill of him. And Ronaldo believed it. The rivalry between Alves and Ronaldo can be traced back to November 2015. The pair clashed as Barca beat Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu, with Ronaldo directing an elbow at the Brazilian for holding him back during a counter-attack—an incident for which Alves was booked and Ronaldo was not. Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images Per the MailOnline's Pete Jenson , after the match, Alves said that while Ronaldo's position at the centre of everything at Real ensured he received plaudits when Los Blancos did well, it equally left him open to criticism if the team performed poorly. He also added that Ronaldo remained an excellent player. The following February, the Portugal international avoided him at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in response to the comments, according to Daniel Prescott of the same outlet. Alves clarified that he had not criticised Ronaldo and was making a more general point rather than speaking about Ronaldo as a person. Alves is now at Juventus having joined from the Blaugrana for free last summer, so unless the Bianconeri meet Real in the UEFA Champions League, they won't be meeting on a pitch any time soon. The 33-year-old has been restricted to just 11 Serie A appearances this season after fracturing his leg in November, but he has returned to first-team action in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Ronaldo has racked up 21 goals and eight assists in 28 games in all competitions.
