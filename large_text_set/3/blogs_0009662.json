The fact is I'm not satisfied with it and I want to change it. \n\"The coach knows I can play as a number six and at right-back, also in the centre of defence. From that he has many options to use me. \n\"I know my weaknesses and work on them â€“ especially when I'm not playing, I try to do more. \n\"In the Bundesliga we have a good lead now and maybe [the team] will be rotated.\" \nKimmich is viewed as a potential long-term successor to Philipp Lahm, Bayern's stalwart captain who will retire at the end of this season, and the 2014 World Cup-winner believes the youngster will soon find his feet again. \n\"Josh has showed what level he can play at but we are at Bayern,\" he told reporters. \n\"It is always difficult to play from the start, you have to accept that. \n\"He is absolutely professional and I believe it is a question of time until he plays again.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T10:18:07.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
