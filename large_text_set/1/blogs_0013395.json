It was the largest leak in U.S. history . At 29 years of age, Manning was also given the longest sentence for leaks of classified documents in U.S. history. \nBut that is now in the past. President Obama has accepted her attorney’s application to commute her sentence to time served. She will be released in May. For the slew of people who believed that her treatment and sentence were unfair, this is a victory.\n\nSince her suicide attempt in July of 2016, a litany of groups stepped up to the pressure to have her sentence commuted. She also filed a transgender prisoner lawsuit, detailing her treatment in prison as “a cycle of anxiety, anger, hopelessness, loss, and depression. I cannot focus. I cannot sleep.” \nRetired Air Force Colonel Col. Morris D. Davis also advocated on Manning’s behalf. CBS reported that Col. Davis wrote a letter attached to her application, advocating for her release, saying her leaks years ago “could fairly be described as inconvenience and embarrassment.” \nThe president also commuted the sentences of 208 others and pardoned 64 people.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:26:14.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
