It's about time.. \"A large Caramel Coffee Coolatta with cream contains 990 calories, 138 grams of sugar, and 47 grams of fat\" https://t.co/4GK7BTX7ag \n— Diane (@ohdianeo) March 23, 2017 \nBut that has never deterred some people who say they only have eyes for Coolattas. @DunkinDonuts the only good thing you have is the coffee coolatta don't get rid of it or revamp it. #dontdoit \n— Jake Rose (@Jrr0823) March 22, 2017 \nAnd a few are considering something truly drastic after the Coolatta news – going to the enemy for coffee. @DunkinDonuts is trashing the coolatta. Looks like I'll be taking myself to @Starbucks from now on \n— Joshua Dawson (@maniacmongoose) March 22, 2017 You're Coffee Coolatta was the only reason I ever went into a @DunkinDonuts .
