I speak my truth. If you don't like it, tough. I will always be honest and stand in my truth. \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 I have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker. \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 \nLahren racked up more than 10,000 likes between those two tweets, but Glenn Beck didn’t seem to be liking much of what he’d heard. Rule another label out. I am NOT a \"constitutional\". I believe in LIFE, liberty and property. Just an old fashioned \"constitutionalist.\" \n— Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) March 17, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:39:02.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
