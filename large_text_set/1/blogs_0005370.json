The game will air on CBS.\nAfter the Dolphins (10-6) lost to New England, 35-14, on Sunday they knew they were locked in as the No. 6 seed in the AFC, and that they were playing third-seeded Pittsburgh (11-5). \nThe only thing that remained was what day and time the Dolphins would play. The entire playoff field was officially set Sunday night. \nThe Dolphins (10-6) are making their first playoff appearance since 2008. And they’re playing an opponent they’ve defeated the past two times they’ve played. \nMiami defeated Pittsburgh, 30-15, on Oct. 16 at Hard Rock Stadium in a game in which running back Jay Ajayi rushed for 204 yards. That 15-point victory is the Dolphins’ second-largest margin this season after the 34-13 victory over the New York Jets two weeks ago. \nTom Brady polished off a season where he had the best touchdown pass-to-interception ratio (28-2) in NFL history. Now, the Dolphins, with their defense reeling, must find their footing to provide any resistance in Pittsburgh next week. (Omar Kelly, Steve Svekis) \nMiami also defeated Pittsburgh, 34-28, in December 2013 in the snow at Heinz Field. \nThe Dolphins and Steelers will meet for the fourth time in the playoffs and the first time since the 1984 AFC Championship game, which the Dolphins won, 45-28, on Jan. 6, 1985. \nMiami is 2-1 all-time against Pittsburgh in the playoffs, winning in 1972 (21-17 in the AFC Championship) and losing in 1979 (34-14 in a divisional playoff game) before winning again in the 1984 playoffs.

Tannehill, who sustained a sprained anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament against Arizona game on Dec. 11, has been seen wearing a brace on his left knee the past few days. \nIn the other wild-card round matchups, Oakland plays at Houston (4:35 p.m., ESPN) and Detroit visits Seattle (8:15, NBC) on Saturday, and the New York Giants play at Green Bay (4:40, FOX ) in the other Sunday game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T07:46:39.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
