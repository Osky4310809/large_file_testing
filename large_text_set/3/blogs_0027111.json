P&G said its Pantene Gold Series of eight care and styling products was the brand’s… more Courtesy of P&G “Mass brands, like Pantene, have inadvertently been a part of this pervasive hair bias with a history of advertising showcasing a limited representation of African-American hairstyles and textures and promoting long, shiny, smooth hair as the pinnacle of hair health and beauty,” said P&G, which noted that Pantene has helped to define “beautiful hair” for 40 years through images influenced by mainstream ideas of what was strong, healthy hair. “Pantene has set out to change this perception and empower all women to embrace their strong and unique hair because all strong hair is beautiful hair,” said the Cincinnati-based maker of consumer goods. As a part of a commitment to better serve the needs of African-American women, P&G created the Pantene Gold Series. P&G said the eight care and styling products make up the brand’s first hair care collection co-created with a team of African-American scientists, stylists and dermatologists. It was designed to deliver Pro-V Nutrient Blends to provide superior strength and moisture for women with relaxed, natural and transitioning hair. P&G’s new commercial to promote the Pantene Gold Series appeared last night on the FOX television show “Empire,” which is especially popular among African-American viewers. P&G plans to air the commercial throughout North America, and the campaign will include digital, social media, print and public relations components. The ad is the latest part of Pantene’s “Strong is Beautiful” brand promotion, which is aimed at empowering girls and women by building their confidence. P&G is encouraging people who see the commercial to share a link via social media and use the hashtag #StrongIsBeautiful along with the @Pantene handle. “We believe that all strong hair is beautiful, whether it’s straight, or curly, natural or in a protective style,” said Jodi Allen , P&G’s vice president of hair care for North America. “Pantene has the power and voice to take action, spark conversations, and motivate a change in perceptions. We recognize the importance for African-American women to feel confident wearing their hair in any style they choose, and we’re celebrating their strength in doing so.” The commercial opens with a shot of musician Jillian Hervey , a Pantene brand ambassador whose naturally curly hair is as big as the viral videos she has made as lead singer of the band Lion Babe. “Learning to embrace my natural curls has been a hard process for me, and I know that many other African-American women relate,” Hervey said. “I’m thrilled Pantene is taking a step in the right direction to celebrate all strong, beautiful textures and styles.” Along with Hervey, the 1-minute commercial features African-American women of all ages with a broad representation of hair textures and styles. The varied styles shown were the creation of Chuck Amos , who works for P&G as a Pantene celebrity stylist. “I love that Pantene is making a commitment to African-American women,” said Amos, who has managed the hair styles of models for numerous fashion shows and editorial shoots. “With the help of the innovative Gold Series Collection, women now have the best products to achieve their desired looks while having the strongest, healthiest and most beautiful hair.” Grey New York created the video, which opens with a poetic voiceover: “We are proudly born/with hair that grows strong as a storm/and doesn’t conform/to a beauty norm/that isn’t our own. “So many wrong things are said/about how it grows from our head/but to think that beauty is only/sleek or wavy is crazy. “Because whether we choose/to wear it relaxed or natural/every strand is testimony/to our history.” “That makes us stronger,” the narrator concludes. “And strong is beautiful.” You can watch the commercial in the video player accompanying this article.
