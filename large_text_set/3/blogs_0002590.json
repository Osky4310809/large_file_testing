The Wildcats are famously one of just five original Division-I programs and the only major conference program that has never made an appearance in the NCAA tournament. \nThat appears to be on the verge of changing, especially after Wednesday night. \nTied at 65 with visiting Michigan and just 1.3 seconds to play, Northwestern needed a miracle if it wanted to pull off a monster win in regulation. Nathan Taphorn’s perfect length-of-the court pass to Derek Pardon for the game-winner certainly qualifies.\nThe victory brings Northwestern’s overall record to 21-9, and guarantees them of a winning record in Big 10 play regardless of what happens in their regular season finale against Purdue on Sunday. \nDespite the crushing loss, Michigan’s postseason fate still appears to be in relatively solid shape as well. The Wolverines are 9-8 in conference play and can score their 20th overall win of the season by beating Nebraska on Sunday.
