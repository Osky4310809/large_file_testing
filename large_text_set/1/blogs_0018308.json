It’s generally the typical go-to ad hominem insults: misogyny, small penis, can’t get laid, parent’s basement, mommy issues, neck beard, or fedora wearing. I am also a fan of when they get really descriptive of just how much they are offended, and of course “is this satire?” \nThis stuff is apparently just so off putting to women that they feel that the dialogue must be silenced, and the originator of the ideas should be “doxxed” and humiliated, if not completely drawn and quartered. They wonder why people do not want to use their real names?!?! Really? Why should we let have people’s immediate lives ruined and their futures compromised just because women were offended? Anything that even remotely challenges the fem-centric perspective is met with violent hostility. \nIt’s bothersome because of the inability to have an honest discussion about several very real topics due to the constant need to placate to the fem-centric perspective. We love to talk about how women were oppressed in the Anglosphere, but there have been plenty of terrible women in history, and some women have had significantly more power than an average gender studies class will ever allude to. The current legal system has a disgusting bias in women’s favor (only 15 women have been put to death since 1973, and women make up 2% of death sentences) and women receive twice as much funding for medical care as men (just watch a pro football game in October). Or, just a simple Google search; “women’s issues” will yield 322 million hits while “men’s issues,” “LGBT issues” and “children’s issues” will yield 26, 29, and 225 million hits respectively. \nWhen 20 children die at Sandy Hook Elementary, things are largely forgotten after the initial buzz. When the Boston Marathon bombing resulted in 5 deaths, and 280 injuries, its again forgotten. But, when Elliot Rodger goes on his shooting spree killing 6 people, I still hear references to it (#yesallwomen). Even when something as seemingly forgettable as when Maria Kang asks “what’s your excuse?” It’s not seen as yet another fitspiration like so many of the other pictures found on Pinterest and Tumblr, it’s seen as fat shaming (mostly a middle class white women issue) and a reason for outrage. \nIt really puts into perspective how much of a protected class women of society really are.
