But Twitter users weren‚Äôt going let a reasonable explanation spoil a good story.\nHere are some of the best theories online.\nThe Statue Went On Strike For ‚ÄòA Day Without Women‚Äô \nMarch 8 is International Women‚Äôs Day and many people are marking the event by going on strike for ‚ÄòA Day Without Women‚Äô, in order to illustrate how important women can be.\n\nIt only seems fair that this extends to the most famous female (statue) in the U.S.\nThe Statue of Liberty has gone dark on #InternationalWomensDay ?

Maybe that's why The Statue of Liberty has gone dark.\n‚Äî Leah Jackson (@Leah____J) March 8, 2017 \nThe Statue Was Protesting President Trump‚Äôs Travel Ban \nPresident Trump just signed a second executive order temporarily banning some refugees and visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries.\nLady Liberty is widely thought of as a symbol welcoming immigrants to the U.S. so people were quick to jump on the idea of the power cut as a political protest. A ‚ÄúRefugees Welcome‚Äù banner was unfurled by activists at the feet of the statue just a few weeks ago.\nThere is nothing coincidental about the loss of power at the Statue of Liberty. Her lights dimmed in reply to another travel ban.\n‚Äî Mike's Ghost (@UnplugFox) March 8, 2017 \nhttps://t.co/cfeQkOAAG2 \nIf it's in response to the travel ban; brilliant. Since she stands to welcome immigrants üôåüèº\n‚Äî trash queen (@harlotstarlet1) March 8, 2017 \nThe Statue Was Hacked By Russia \nAccording to parts of the Internet we‚Äôve all been hacked by ‚ÄòRussia‚Äô, so social media users were quick to joke about the lights being infiltrated. At least, we think it was a joke.\nThe Statue of Liberty was hacked by Russia!\n‚Äî Brotato Chip (@LebroJenkins) March 8, 2017 \n@congratulations @potus , the Statue of Liberty has gone dark.

After a period darkness, the lights on Lady Liberty are back on and normal service resumed.\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:26:09.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
