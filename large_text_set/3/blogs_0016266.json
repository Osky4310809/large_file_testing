I’m trying. I’m trying everything to be able to get back and play. I love that event. It’s meant so much to me in my life. It has so much history and meaning to me, I’d love to get back.” \nWoods hasn’t played since Feb. 2, when he withdrew before the second round of the Dubai Desert Classic because of back spasms. He withdrew from three events since then (Riviera, Honda, Bay Hill) and now is uncertain for the Masters, which begins in 17 days. \nGolf Digest reported Friday that, via anonymous sources, Woods was “doubtful” to play in the Masters. Woods’ agent, Mark Steinberg, disputed that report , saying that no decision has been made and that he and Woods are “not in a situation to even talk about playing in the Masters now.” \nWoods hasn’t made a public appearance since Dubai. He was on TV Monday to promote his new book about the 1997 Masters. \n“I need to get back physically,” he said. “The mind is sharp. I just need to get the body willing to do it. That’s the hard part, is getting the prep time in. I haven’t been able to get as much prep time in, haven’t been able to train like I used to, practice like I used to, so it’s been harder. \n“My priorities have changed a lot. My kids now dominate my life, and that’s a good thing.” Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:50:01.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
