At one point, while the victim is backed into a corner, someone is heard shouting “F*** Donald Trump. F*** white people.” \nThe four people charged are black and the victim is white. \nHowever, the president remains hopeful about the future. \n“I take these things very seriously.” \n“The good news is that the next generation that’s coming behind us … have smarter, better, more thoughtful attitudes about race. \n“I think the overall trajectory of race relations in this country is actually very positive. It doesn’t mean that all racial problems have gone away. It means that we have the capacity to get better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T04:31:59.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
