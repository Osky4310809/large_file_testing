Hameed Ibrahim Ali on the issue of wearing uniform. AttorneyGeneral of Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami \nIn the letter, the Attorney- General was said to have disclosed that there was no way the Senate could force Ali to wear uniform when President Muhammadu Buhari does not wear military uniform as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. He was alleged to have accused Senate President Bukola Saraki of not wearing his complete legislative regalia in line with legislative conventions. \nOnuesoke who spoke to journalists at Abeokuta, Ogun State, during climate change workshop said if truly the Attorney-General made the statement, it meant that threat to Nigerian democracy was being enlarged daily by the government. \nHe explained that it was out of place and disrespect for the Attorney –General to compare the office of the President of Nigeria or that of the President of the Senate to Comptroller-General of Nigeria Customs Service.
