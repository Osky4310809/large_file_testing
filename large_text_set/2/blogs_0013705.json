Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) has once again introduced a resolution in the Senate recognizing Charles Darwin ‘s birthday. ( Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) introduced a similar resolution in the House last month.) \nSenate Resolution 59 expresses “support for the designation of February 12, 2017, as ‘Darwin Day’ and recogniz[es] the importance of science in the betterment of humanity.” \nThe text reads as follows: \nWhereas Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution by the mechanism of natural selection, which, together with the monumental amount of scientific evidence Charles Darwin compiled to support the theory, provides humanity with a logical and intellectually compelling explanation for the diversity of life on Earth; \nWhereas the validity of the theory of evolution by natural selection developed by Charles Darwin is further strongly supported by the modern understanding of the science of genetics; \nWhereas it has been the human curiosity and ingenuity exemplified by Charles Darwin that has promoted new scientific discoveries that have helped humanity solve many problems and improve living conditions; \nWhereas the advancement of science must be protected from those unconcerned with the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change; \nWhereas the teaching of creationism in some public schools compromises the scientific and academic integrity of the education systems of the United States; \nWhereas Charles Darwin is a worthy symbol of scientific advancement on which to focus and around which to build a global celebration of science and humanity intended to promote a common bond among all the people of the Earth; and \nWhereas February 12, 2017, is the anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin in 1809 and would be an appropriate date to designate as “Darwin Day”: Now, therefore, be it \nResolved, That the Senate– \n(1) supports the designation of “Darwin Day”; and \n(2) recognizes Charles Darwin as a worthy symbol on which to celebrate the achievements of reason, science, and the advancement of human knowledge. \nBlumenthal introduced identical legislation in 2015 and 2016 . \nThe Secular Coalition for America is thrilled by the resolution: \n“This resolution is an affirmation of Charles Darwin’s contributions to science and the spirit of intellectual courage he displayed in the face of adversity,” said Larry T. Decker, Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America. “As Congress and the White House issue gag orders and subpoenas against the scientific community, it is our hope that this resolution will inspire scientists to resist the political pressure to skew or suppress their research. If science is to serve the public good it must be guided by evidence and experiment, not partisan political agendas. Now more than ever, we need to follow Darwin’s example.” \nNo word yet on which Republicans will vote against this purely symbolic bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:54:36.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
