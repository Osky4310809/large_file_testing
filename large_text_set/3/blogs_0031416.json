(Her words, not ours!!!) \nLast week, The Big Bang Theory star dropped a video on YouTube to vent about something that's really been bothering her: the asinine way men refer to adult women as \"girls\"! \nIn the clip, the actress says that women need to start correcting people who refer to them as \"girls,\" claiming the practice is proof that our patriarchal society views women differently than men. \nRelated: Lena Dunham Hits Back After Shamed For Losing Weight! \nBased on how men typically describe women in childlike terms (girl, baby, you-fine-ass-embryo, etc.) \"unconsciously\" implies that adult women are inferior to men. \nThe 41-year-old says men aren't usually referred to as boys \"because it's demeaning and emasculating.\" Well, she ain't wrong!!! \nDo U agree? Hear Bialik's take on the colloquial conundrum in the video (above)!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:52:45.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
