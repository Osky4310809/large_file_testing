Photo credit: United States Department of Defense Minimal intelligence. Navy SEALs unequipped for the firefight they encountered. Al Qaeda fighters that knew they were coming. An Osprey that hard-landed and had to be destroyed. One SEAL dead along with at least 10 civilian women and children. None of this was supposed to happen.\nAdvertisement \n\nAnd yet it did, in the first known military raid of Donald Trump’s presidential administration over this past weekend, one that was by nearly all accounts a disaster. Under normal circumstances it probably would’ve passed quietly. But the raid, deep into Yemeni desert, was anything but quiet.\nThe incident is detailed in a damning Reuters report, which details a harrowing account of Navy SEALs, unequipped for a large amount of resistance, dropped into a reinforced Al Qaeda stronghold packed to the brim with enemy troops, land mines, and snipers, all in effort to gather some intelligence.\nAdvertisement \n\nAnd Al Qaeda knew that the SEALs, along with a special forces team from the United Arab Emirates, were coming before they even got there, according to the New York Times :\nIn this case, the assault force of several dozen commandos, which also included elite soldiers from the United Arab Emirates, was jinxed from the start. Qaeda fighters were somehow tipped off to the stealthy advance toward the village — perhaps by the whine of American drones that local tribal leaders said were flying lower and louder than usual.\nThrough a communications intercept, the commandos knew that the mission had been somehow compromised, but pressed on toward their target roughly five miles from where they had been flown into the area. “They kind of knew they were screwed from the beginning,” one former SEAL Team 6 official said.\nDuring the course of the night, the Reuters report says, a “brutal firefight” erupted, resulting in the death of at least 30, including one SEAL, 14 militants, and the aforementioned civilians, which reports indicate were being used as human shields by the militants. And as the SEALs found an immediate need to get out of the situation, everything seemed to get worse:\nAs Sunday’s firefight intensified, the raiders called in Marine helicopter gunships and Harrier jump jets, and then two MV-22 Osprey vertical takeoff and landing aircraft to extract the SEALs.\nOne of the two suffered engine failure, two of the officials said, and hit the ground so hard that two crew members were injured, and one of the Marine jets had to launch a precision-guided bomb to destroy it.﻿\n\nOne of the civilians killed, Nora al-Awlaki, was an eight-year-old girl and an American citizen. Her father, Anwar al-Awlaki, was born in New Mexico, and was considered a major Al Qaeda figure before his death from an American drone strike in 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:23:30.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
