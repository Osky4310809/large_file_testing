But yeah we get it, this time it’s personal right? Could we stop politicizing everything for just a few hours? jakec4 says: Feb 5, 2017 4:57 PM \nWhats one more celebrity shooting their mouth off about a country that has allowed them to shoot there mouth off because someone else spilled their blood for them. questionableprovenance says: Feb 5, 2017 4:58 PM \nFive seconds is not going to be enough to censor the response from the crowd, which I expect to range from booing to perhaps somewhat vile language. \n“And now for an unscheduled commercial break…” Feb 5, 2017 4:58 PM \nNada GaGa…..

MichaelEdits says: Feb 5, 2017 5:01 PM \nI watch the Patriots/Panthers Super Bowl in China. There was a one-hour delay. I had to read about the wardrobe malfunction the next day. I don’t think they put a tape delay on Prince. Play that, um, guitar. cadreamer1969 says: Feb 5, 2017 5:02 PM \nThe pregame show is so bad I had to change the channel to golf and won’t go back until kickoff. Feb 5, 2017 5:04 PM \nSuper Bowl hoopla is annoying. Just play the damn game like every other one. liparulos says: Feb 5, 2017 5:05 PM \nHow about if, instead of President Trump, the “entertainers” criticize Commissioner Goodell? Will they still get the #SpartacusSuperBowl treatment? backuppunter says: Feb 5, 2017 5:14 PM \nYeah I hate it when celeberties that are unqualified to talk politics try to tell americans what to think. that’s why i voted for trump Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment.
