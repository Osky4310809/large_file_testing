Ward has been a regular between the sticks for David Wagner's promotion-chasing side turning in a number of strong performances and getting some genuinely valuable experience. \nWard will no doubt be a key player as the Yorkshire side press for promotion to the Premier League and has done enough to give himself a good chance of being involved with Klopp's first-team squad next week. \nIn an ideal word this would be how all loan moves pan out, with both parties benefiting from the young stopper's spell across the Pennines. \nChances of getting into first team: 8/10 Pedro Chirivella - Go Ahead Eagles Chirivella has made the switch to the Netherlands (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nAge : 19 \nOn loan at : Go Ahead Eagles \nAppearances : 7 \nAnother January loanee following half a season with the under-23 side and has made a strong start in the Netherlands. \nOperating as a playmaker, he has already shown his ability to influence games, setting up an assist for Arsenal loanee Dan Crowley last weekend. If the teenage Spaniard can turn in some more impressive performances during the run-in then he will give Klopp another option next season. \nChances of getting into first team : 7/10 Allan Allan is still grappling with work permit issues (Photo: John Powell) \nAge : 19 \nOn loan at : Hertha BSC \nAppearances : 8 \nWhile the Brazilian has not received as much playing time as he would have hoped for, there are some positives to be gleaned. \nThe Bundesliga is a significant step up from his spells in Iceland and Belgium and he has shown that he is developing physically and increasing his strength on the ball, a vital attribute if he is to succeed in the Premier League. \nOne key facet of the move is to gain regular playing time in order to land a work permit, so he needs more playing time - and that could be a deciding factor in his Anfield future. \nChances of getting into first team : 5/10 Taiwo Awoniyi Awoniyi was snapped up by Liverpool in 2015 (Photo: Dean Mouhtaropoulos - FIFA) \nAge : 19 \nOn loan at : NEC \nAppearances : 13 \nStill very raw, Awoniyi has made the step up to the Eredivisie where he has struggled to make much of an impression on the first-team. A slow start saw him lose his place in the first-team but he has begun to notch up some goals in the reserve team. \nUnless he can force his way back into the first-team picture then it's hard to see this loan spell going down as a success. \nChances of getting into first team : 5/10 poll loading Will Liverpool finish in the top four? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:02:15.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
