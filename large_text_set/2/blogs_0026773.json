Trading in his two-bedroom rental apartment , Noah is now the proud new owner of a $10 million duplex within the Stella Tower in Hell’s Kitchen, reports the Wall Street Journal (h/t Luxury Listings NYC ). Noah’s new digs affords him three bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms spanning nearly 3,600 square feet. The lower level is a loft-like space with 14-foot ceilings, wall-to-wall windows, and an eat-in chef’s kitchen with all the fancy finished one would expect. The upper level boasts a second living room, only this one leads onto the private terrace. Measuring at an astounding 934 square feet, this massive outdoor space puts some of Manhattan’s full-sized apartments to shame, and naturally, the views are amazing. Other details include an en-suite master bedroom, walk-in closets, and solid oak flooring throughout.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:04:52.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
