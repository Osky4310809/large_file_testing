This highly suggests that we'll have a price and date set in the wii hours of the night.\nQuantities will be limited, however. Due to limited stock we are only able to offer one unit per customer per address, Amazon noted. We will be fulfilling customer orders in the order in which they were placed.\nWe'll be livestreaming and providing live commentary on the reveal tonight for the more extreme night owls and early birds among us.\nIn the meantime, check out the above video detailing what we know about the Switch so far.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPude3R45co", "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01MFADJFV/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_DA9DybPQ224MM?tag=nintlife-21"], "published": "2017-01-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:56:00.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
