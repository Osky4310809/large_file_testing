Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA British couple on the run are accused of conning victims of their savings and kidnapping their pets. \nThe scheming pair pose as property tycoons as they travel Europe with two daughters and two dogs. \nKevin Brennan, 51, and Oxford ­graduate Emma Foulger, 48, have left a near-£1million trail of debt and misery. \nA Sunday Mirror investigation found: A string of investors were left ­thousands of pounds out of pocket after being charmed by Brummie Brennan. The conman told victims he worked in the Secret Service, worked as a hacker for the US government, knew F1 legend Michael Schumacher and had millions to invest – once punters put a stake in. The couple use villas and hotels but allegedly flee without paying the bill. They set up a magazine for ex-pats but never paid the staff, it is claimed. Some victims reported they had pets taken after falling for the couple’s stories. Mai is on the run with her parents \nThe couple’s web of dodgy deals and deceit has taken them across the South of France and into Italy. Reports have been filed with police in both countries. \nFoulger’s family today make a desperate plea for them to hand themselves in for the sake of her daughters from previous relationships, Aisha, 22, and Mai, 16. \nSister Victoria Foulger, 44, said: “I just want them to stop living in their fantasy world and realise they are leaving a trail of destruction behind them. \n“I worry for my nieces as they are ­vulnerable and have been dragged along with this. Mai is only 16 and we don’t think she has been to school since they fled France in 2014. \n\"I’ve tried to get in touch but every time I call they have moved on somewhere new.” This is one of the couple's alleged victims \nIn a Bonnie and Clyde-style spree the pair are accused of leaving a £500,000 trail of unpaid bills along the French ­Riviera, while ­cheating “pals” with lies of ­property schemes and publishing firms they planned to set up. \nThey are currently thought to be in Italy, ­moving between hotels around Tuscany with rottweiler Beau and French hunting dog Scarlett. \nOne alleged victim is Sonya Saldana, a friend who was reunited with her cat and dog only last week. \nShe claims they were held hostage by the family when she asked for her £7,000 back. \nUS-born Sonya said: “We trusted them and they repaid us like this. It’s scary. These dangerous people lure you in with elaborate stories, promise the world, then disappear. This is the villa she wanted to buy \n“Brennan tells everyone he used to be in the British Secret Service and they claimed they had over five million euros in cash to pay for a luxury villa. \n“Then they disappeared and took our pets with them. They must be stopped.” \nFor years, the couple appeared to be the perfect middle class couple. Foulger studied languages at Oxford – where she hails from – before a short-lived career as a BBC journalist. \nBrennan – nicknamed Gatsby after the fictional millionaire – claims to have worked in various civil service roles. \nThey painted a picture of a British society couple in the ex-pat communities they infiltrated in the South of France where they met eight years ago. Aisha is also on the run with her family \nA ­family ­member said: “When they lure in a ­generous host, they lead a party lifestyle. \n\"At other times, when someone has started to see through them, they ­disappear and lead a nomadic lifestyle – moving themselves, possessions and two dogs without a car – until they gain the confidence and trust of someone else.” \nFoulger’s life was already a whirlwind before she met Brennan. Incredibly bright, she was home-taught from 13 because school was too easy. \nBut despite straight-As and a place at Oxford, she never held down a job for long. \nShe lived in Turkey for three years where she met the love of her life, a ­soldier who was later killed in action. And when she returned to the UK a string of failed relationships followed. The couple are even said to have kidnapped people's pets \nShe converted to Islam, briefly ­changed her name to Hidayah and ­married a fellow convert. \nBut when the relationship broke down after the birth of Mai, she moved on to Canada – then finally to France. \nVictim Sonya first came across the couple in Italy – unaware Brennan had been ordered to face a French court over one of his phoney property deals. \nA ruling was made in his absence that he owed his friend Olivier Jaulin 235,000 euros – just over £200,000. He was also fined 5,000 euros. \nAt the time, Brennan and Foulger were facing the prospect of multiple legal actions for non-payment of fees while running the Herault and Aude Times, a magazine aimed at ex-pats. \nPublic relations firm In The Mood claimed it was owed £26,000 while a woman reportedly handed them her £52,000 life savings. The posters searching for the couple \nOthers included British photographer Barry Beckett, who claims he is owed £2,600. \nBrennan promised they would all be flown to London for a lavish launch at a five-star hotel. It never happened. \nThe Sunday Mirror has been given access to police reports made by tens of alleged victims over two years. \nFoulger’s sister, speaking through tears at her home in Nova Scotia, added: “I have been taking calls and emails on a regular basis from strangers who tracked me down to appeal to me about any number of scams. \n\"This includes a woman who told me she gave them 60,000 euros then had a breakdown when she realised she’d been conned. \n“I’m embarrassed by their actions, but I won’t disown my sister. I love her and I love my nieces. I believe she is vulnerable and completely besotted with Kevin and can’t see past him. \n“My husband and I visited them a few years ago in France. Emma had told us he was fluent in Italian. A wanted poster for the couple \n“My husband is of Italian origin and he greeted Kevin in Italian. It was ­obvious he had no idea what he’d said. He skulked away and spent the three days of our visit avoiding us.” \nPolice in Northern Italy were alerted earlier this month after Sonya claimed pets Charlie and Bella had been taken. \nLike many alleged ­victims, Sonya says she worked for the couple for nothing amid excuses about ­technical glitches with her pay. S \nhe says she and her partner Adam went to Lake Como to buy a £5million villa for Brennan, who was back home looking after their pets. \nHe was meant to arrive after three days to close the deal. But for 44 days he made excuses and failed to show up. \nWhen Sonya and Adam returned home on February 27 the family had vanished – along with the pets. \nEnglishman and villa owner Ray Dennis, who lives in Serra di ­Rapolano, Tuscany, says he was left out of pocket by yarn-spinner Brennan. \nRay said: “He sounded a proper toff. He claimed he’d known racing driver Michael Schumacher and had ­impressed him with his driving. \n“He said he made his fortune ­working for the US government as one of the first hackers. \n“I let them stay with me for six months. They ran up the biggest gas and electricity bills ever and I had to ask them to leave.” \nBefore fleeing for Italy the couple are accused of deceiving staff on their English-language mag. \nThey hired writers, photographers, a PR firm and a personal assistant, but never paid them. \nPhotographer Beckett said Brennan was delusional but also very clever. He said: “No one has heard of him. He is impossible to find on the internet. \n“He seems to know how to exist below the radar, be invisible.” \nBrit Hugh McCamley and wife Dominique, who live in the South of France, say they are owed £10,000. \nHugh also learned the couple ran up a £3,500 bill after leaving seven ­moggies at a cattery near Milan for 45 days. \nWhen the owner called Foulger she allegedly fobbed him off by saying Brennan had died in an accident. \nFrench police investigator Didier Mimault said: “Kevin Russell Brennan and Emma Foulger are wanted in France.” Interpol has also been alerted. \nBrennan and Foulger did not ­res pond to requests for a comment.
