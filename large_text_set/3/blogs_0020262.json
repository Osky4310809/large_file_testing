That explains why he was so futile. \nThis was based on quarterbacks who had over 200 passing attempts in 2016. Pro Football Focus notes that Keenum, an upcoming free agent, had 3.7% of his attempts batted last season. \nAs we all remember, Keenum eventually lost his starting job to rookie Jared Goff. QBs with the highest rate of batted passes in 2016Case Keenum, 3.7% \n— Pro Football Focus (@PFF) March 20, 2017 \nNot only did he have a lot of batted passes, Keenum had a negative touchdown-to-interception ratio as well. \nHe was in the bottom-ten for completion percentage and yards per attempt . \nAccording to Sporting Charts , Keenum was also in the bottom ten among quarterbacks with at least 200 passing attempts for highest dropped passes percentage. \nIt’s safe to say that, for many reasons, the former Rams quarterback had trouble completing passes for Los Angeles in 2016. Don’t expect him to return to the Rams in 2017. Here's Kenny Britt in Week 2, losing Richard Sherman with an out-route in the end zone.
