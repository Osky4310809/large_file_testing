File photo by Ed Jones/AFP \nMANILA, Philippines – An annual survey in the US demonstrated the detrimental effects that recent incidents have had on Samsung's reputation. \nThe South Korean tech giant experienced a big drop in this year's Reputation Quotient Ratings by Harris Poll, going from the 7th spot in 2016 to the 49th spot. In 2015, Samsung ranked 3rd. \nThe ranking is based on the perception of US consumers and not entirely representative of the world view. The polls though carry a lot of weight as it involves the participation of 30,000 US individuals, which judged the brands according to six dimensions: social responsibility, vision and leadership, financial performance, products and services, workplace environment, and emotional appeal. \nThe Harris Poll conducts the reputation survey annually for the most visible companies in the US, and has been conducting it since 1999. \nThis year's polls were carried out from November 28, 2016 to December 16, 2016 – a period that included the December 8 probe into Samsung heir Lee Jae-Yong and his alleged involvement in a corruption scandal with impeached South Korean president Park Geun-Hye. A few months before that, the brand was in the midst of an unprecedented global recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 phone for its exploding battery. REPUTATION RATINGS. The annual survey ranks the 100 most visible companies in the US. Screenshot from The Harris Poll \nThese incidents fall under 2 of the biggest risks to corporate reputation, according to the Harris Poll: \"Intentional wrongdoing or illegal actions by company leaders\" and \"product recalls.\" \nWhile the latest earnings reports for the brand show positive growth, what can't be denied is that the incidents have had a significant impact on Samsung's reputation. \nThis year will be critical for the tech giant in halting the reputation slide. \nOn a positive note, Samsung's overall score of 75.17 is still considered as \"Very Good\" in Harris Poll's rating system. Last year, they scored 80.44 – an \"Excellent\" rating. \nSome other tech companies on the list include Amazon (1st, 86.27), Apple (5th, 82.07), Google (8th, 82.00), Tesla (9th, 81.70), Netflix (18th, 79.86), Microsoft (20th, 79.29), Sony (42nd, 76.76), Facebook (66th, 72.29) and Yahoo! (72nd, 70.56). \nYou can view the full report here .  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:43:12.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
