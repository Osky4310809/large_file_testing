Macy’s was vocal in its decision to cut ties with Trump and end its distribution of his clothing line because of “disparaging” remarks about Mexicans. Those who believe in tight border security, stopping illegal immigration & SMART trade deals w/other countries should boycott @Macys . \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2015 \nTrump fired back in true Donald fashion, claiming that the corporation supported illegal immigration. Many of Trump’s supporters shredded their Macy’s credit cards and tens of thousands called in to complain about the company’s apparent concession to political correctness.   \nSo in the feud between Trump and Macy’s, let’s tally the scores: \nTrump won the presidential election of the United States and will be sworn into office in a mere two weeks. Macy’s lost thousands of customers and is in the process of closing 100 stores, losing 10,000 jobs, and having its stock price plummet. \nI think we have to call this one for The Donald. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and be sure to add your thoughts to the comment section below.
