The menu includes 15 different cuts of beef, lamb, chicken, pork, and sausage — all grilled to taste — for one price. That also includes access to the plentiful salad bar, hot cheese breads, caramelized bananas, and other traditional dishes from southern Brazil. The restaurant’s signature meat cut is picanha, known as the beef top sirloin in the U.S. Additional offerings include filet mignon, a ribeye, lamb chops, leg of lamb, pork ribs, beer-marinated chicken legs, and more. A gaucho chef serves guests tableside by slicing meats off skewers directly onto their plates. The salad bar offers more than 30 options including a variety of greens, fresh vegetables, cured meats, imported cheeses, and potato salad. Plus, guests have their choice of traditional Brazilian side dishes such as garlic mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, hot cheese breads known as pão de queijo , farofa (often served alongside meats to soak up the juices), crispy polenta, and rice and beans. Non-alcoholic drinks like signature Brazilian frozen lemonade, Guaraná (a guaraná-flavored soft drink) and other sodas, tea, and coffee anchor the beverage menu. Expect wine, beer, and mixed drinks to be added when the restaurant secures its liquor license. There are also desserts—if you can possibly save room. Drinks and desserts are not included in the per person price. The lunch and dinner menu for both weekdays and weekends are the same though the prices change per person: Dinner: $35.90", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:13:28.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
