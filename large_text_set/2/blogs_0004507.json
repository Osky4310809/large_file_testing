After the game, Brady had an emotional embrace with Belichick and running back LeGarrette Blount came in to let his quarterback know that he’s the greatest of all time. \n\nrpmsports18: \"You're the fucking greatest\" Fox FOX Super Bowl Post-Game https://t.co/DlCPCcmZsU pic.twitter.com/kGgEdjUIuk \n— FanSportsClips (@FanSportsClips) February 6, 2017 \n\nBrady’s fifth Super Bowl ring gives him the most of all-time, eclipsing the mark of four Super Bowl rings that he shared with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw prior to Sunday night in Houston. \nFor the count the rings crowd, Brady is certainly the greatest of all-time. There will be those that argue whether his stats match that of other all-time greats, but it’s impossible to not have him near the top of the list. And at least we know where Blount stands. Among the running back’s end of game exploits, this isn’t exactly the worst thing he’s done .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:58:19.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
