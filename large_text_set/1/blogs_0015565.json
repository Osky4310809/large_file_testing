Trump inauguration boycott grows after John Lewis feud \n“We felt that we had to make it known that we didn’t want to seem disrespectful in any way, shape or form to Bruce and his music and his band,” the band’s keyboardist and manager, Will Forte, said, according to Rolling Stone . \n“I don’t want to upset them.

The band’s worn out. Everybody loves to have their 15 minutes of fame, but maybe not this way.” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
