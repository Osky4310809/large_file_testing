The 68-year-old rocker hopes to return to the road in October in time for a 10-night residency at New York’s City Winery. \n“I want to thank my fans and friends for supporting me while I rest up and focus on getting better and back on the road as soon as I can,” Allman said in a statement. “I’ve been working hard with my band, my pride and joy, to play our music for everyone. We’ll see y’all in October.” \nAllman did not disclose the exact nature of his health issues. In 2010, Allman had a successful liver transplant, but was forced to cancel a tour the following year after suffering from an upper respiratory condition stemming from a successful liver transplant he had the previous year. He also suffers from atrial fibrillation, which caused Allman to switch to a gluten-free vegan diet.
