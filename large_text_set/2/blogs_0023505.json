The late singer's former Wham! partner, Andrew Ridgeley, introduced a beautiful tribute by Chris Martin, who performed Michael's 1986 song, \"A Different Corner.\" WATCH: Adele Drops F-Bomb After Briefly Stopping George Michael Tribute at GRAMMYs, Still Delivers Powerful Performance \"On Christmas Day 2016, the greatest singer-songwriter of his generation, an icon of his era, and my beloved friend, George Michael, was lost,\" Ridgeley said on stage, accompanied by Wham's backup singers, Pepsi and Shirlie (real names Helen DeMacque and Shirlie Holliman). \"A supernova in a firmament of shining stars had been extinguished, and it felt like the sky had fallen in. It started out ordinarily enough: In 1975, we were two boys that happened to share a mutual sense of humor, a love of life-affirming music, the records and artists it gave birth to, and a shared sense that we understood it,\" he continued, recalling his early days with Michael. \"George's contribution to the great archive of contemporary music rests alongside the immortals,\" Ridgeley added. \"His is a legacy of unquestionable brilliance and one that will continue to shine and resonate for generations to come.\" Martin then took the stage to sing \"A Different Corner\" while footage of the star played in the background.
