It only accepts cash, because banks and other credit card providers are forbidden by federal law to accept drug money. Its cannabis products, including dope suppositories and intimate oils, as well as Sacred Dirty Chai truffles and a vast array of weed strains (named Karma Bitch, Ghost Trainwreck Haze and so forth) are sold from a backroom, which the shopper must provide a proof of identity to access. But the shop is not at all shady. \nIt is pleasant, trendy and staffed by well-mannered herb enthusiasts, known as “bud-tenders”. In one of America’s richest liberal havens, it is also thriving, to the benefit of all Boulder’s residents: the city levies a 22.35% sales tax on recreational dope, and hot demand for warehouse space from pot growers points to a boom. Having permitted the first legal dope shops to open in January 2014, Colorado is expected to have collected around $135m from dope taxes last year, around three times more than it will have made from taxing alcohol. Following its example—and pro-pot votes in California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada on November 8th—recreational dope will soon be legal in seven states and Washington, DC. Another 24 states allow dope to be used for medical purposes. Yet there is a shadow on this smoky, happy scene. \nBecause dope remains illegal under federal law, any pot shop is, in effect, a US attorney-general’s whim away from closure. Barack Obama’s administration, though opposed to legalising cannabis, ruled that this would be a waste of resources in states, such as Colorado, where dope peddling is well-regulated. Senator Jeff Sessions, whom Mr Trump has nominated to be his attorney-general, appears to take a different view. “We need grown-ups in Washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalised,” he has said—and also, “good people don’t smoke marijuana”. Mr Trump has taken seemingly contradictory positions on the issue. Campaigning for election, he said that whether marijuana should be legal was a matter for individual states to decide; his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, said the same. But he also called Colorado’s cannabis regime, which is considered a model of prudent regulation by stoners and investors alike, “a real problem”. His vice-president-elect Mike Pence has, as governor of Indiana, presided over one of America’s toughest anti-marijuana regimes. \nThe stoners and their allies are worried. “There’s very good reason to be concerned,” says Andrew Freedman, Colorado’s director of marijuana a coordination. “This could become an enforcement priority”. A spokesman for The Farm, Adam Dickey, says the same: “It’s a little scary, we are very concerned, though we’re not in full-on panic mode yet”. \nIt is hard to imagine Mr Sessions carrying out the crackdown he appears to want. It would be expensive; nine out of 10 drugs arrests are conducted by state law enforcement agents, who would not assist Mr Sessions, so federal agencies in states such as Colorado would need heavily reinforcing. It would also be contrary to the principle of state autonomy that Mr Trump claims to cherish. \nAnd it would be against the tide of public opinion. Around 60% of Americans say they are in favour of legalising pot—including around half of Republicans. That represents a swelling consensus in favour of legalisation; a decade ago, around 30% said the same. There is no reason to expect that increasingly relaxed attitude to go into reverse; legalising cannabis looks broadly successful and around a quarter of Americans will soon live in states where it has taken place. \nMr Trump may yet find reason to swim against this tide. His supporters, who tend to be old, white and conservative, are more hostile to legalising dope than the most other Americans. Mr Sessions could even try to launch a crackdown in spite of his boss’s views. \nIn short, a fug of uncertainty may hang over the legal dope industry throughout Mr Trump’s presidency. But when it is over, the industry will take off again. Rather like America, dope peddling is an enterprise built on solid foundations, even if it may be heading for some short-term pain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T03:19:43.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
