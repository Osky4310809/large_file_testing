With festivals being celebrated every second week, multiple birthday cakes to cut, and a mum whose sole mission in life is to make sure you have extra helping at every meal, dieting is so damn hard. The worst part is, the moment you tell people you are on a diet, they act super supportive, encourage you, tell you that they are going on one soon too, and then open a bag of chips in front of your face and munch away to glory. So, if you, like the rest of us, have tried to go on a diet anytime, we bet you'll relate to these various stages. 1. You decide to finally get started and take the first step - tell your mom, the one person who thinks that if you don't take second helpings, you are sick! She is happy that you have decided to burn the calories, but she ends the conversation with asking you if she should make dessert tomorrow to celebrate ... SMH!2. You get up with a mission ... today is the big day and you spend half an hour filling your tiffin with raisins, healthy homemade food and water with lemon and tulsi leaves. You are ready. 3. You reach work and realise it is the boss's birthday. WOW, what a day to begin with. There is no way you can avoid eating that cake. And that second helping.4. It's 11AM, you've already eaten those two helpings of cake (because #BossKaBirthday) and now you are part of the committee that responsible for planning out tomorrow's drinks, lunch and dinner. Well, tomorrow is another day. 5. You just realised that your \"healthy tiffin\" is untouched and if your mom finds out, you are DEAD. You spend the day trying to convince people to eat your homemade food, and not sushi and end up eating it all yourself. Day one of the diet is thus, a complete disaster.6. It's Tuesday today, and you decide to skip the week and start over next week, because Monday is shubh !7. You spend the rest of the week stuffing your face. You are going on a diet soon and this is your only chance to live life.8. Three days to go for your diet to begin. You meet a friend for drinks (you need to celebrate before you start that diet) and she proceeds to tell you about this diet where you eat only carbs, which her neighbour's aunt's son did and lost 12 kilos. Wow, you've found your calling. 9. You spend the weekend researching the diet, make a food chart and are super excited to being.10. You wake up on a Monday to realise it's mom's birthday .... *Cry silent tears while eating mom's birthday cake* Gifs via Tumblr / Giphy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:19:35.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
