Since Yalu 10.2 jailbreak is not available for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, owners of these devices have very little reason to downgrade to it. \nIf you have not already saved the SHSH blobs for iOS 10.2 for your device, you cannot save it now since Apple has stopped signing the firmware. \niOS 10.2.1 is a relatively minor update when compared to iOS 10.2 and only contains some security patches and bug fixes. \nApple has already released the first beta of iOS 10.3 which comes with a number of new features including Find My AirPods, user security section in Settings, APFS, and more. The final version of the OS is expected to be released in March. Like this post?
