Hatch passed away today in Los Angeles at age 71, following a battle with pancreatic cancer. \nWhile Richard Hatch has played other roles on both the big and small screens, his involvement with the Battlestar Galactica franchise go above and beyond simply appearing as an actor. More than a decade before the BSG reboot, Hatch championed a return to the franchise, co-writing seven novels continuing the story of the original series. \nA few of Richard Hatch’s fellow Battlestar Galactica cast and crew have paid their respects via social media. You can take a look at a few of their posts below. Please share your own favorite Richard Hatch memories in the comments below. Goodbye my friend. See you on the other side.

His passing is a heavy blow to the entire BSG family. \n— Ronald D. Moore (@RonDMoore) February 7, 2017 I’ve told the story how Richard once defended me before a hostile crowd – still remains one of the most selfless acts I’ve ever witnessed. \n— Ronald D. Moore (@RonDMoore) February 8, 2017 \nI share tragic news with a heavy heart. Richard Hatch is no longer with us. Goodbye Tom Zarek / Apollo #SoSayWeAll https://t.co/wmisRxVixe \n— Bear McCreary (@bearmccreary) February 7, 2017 I will have more to say about Richard Hatch and what he meant to my life and career.
