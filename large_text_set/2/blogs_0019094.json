valcucine , who has been at the forefront of the premium kitchen sector for more than 35 years; LAGO , one of the most eclectic italian design brands with innovative visions and models for living for more than 30 years; finally kristalia , a company working in the panorama of furniture design that has been defending the concept of ‘made in italy’ for more than 20 years. \nin-house product testing machines ensure quality across kristalia’s goods \n\n\nduring the tour, visitors will be introduced to the people behind each of these brands, offering a glimpse into the creative and business development of their work . this will be intertwined with visits to major cultural institutions like brion cemetery by carlo scarpa in san vito d’altivole; canova museum by antonio canova in possagno; eni village by edoardo gellner and carlo scarpa in borca di cadore; fondaco dei tedeschi by OMA and punta della dogana museum by tadao ando in venice; and finally, villa emo by andrea palladio in fanzolo di vedelago. \nLAGO headquarters in villa del conte, padova \n\n\nall in all, the country can be considered the largest ‘open air’ design museum in the world. home to more than 25,000 design manufacturers, 3400 museums, 2100 archaeological sites and parks, the country has the highest number of properties (51) included in UNESCO’s list of world heritage sites. thus, its position as the cultural centre of the world makes it a reference to the rest of the globe for the historical and contemporary lifestyle it exudes. till this day, italian companies still embrace the strong craftsmanship and high-quality tradition of the local working hands associated with the ‘made in italy’ status.
