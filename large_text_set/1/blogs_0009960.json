Now, thanks to an over-the-air software update, the Tesla Model S is set to go even faster. \nWhen updated with firmware 2.52.22 or later, the P100D will be able to offer a Ludicrous Plus mode with a five-second hold of the Ludicrous mode button on the touchscreen menu, with a dialog box asking to confirm that you do, in fact, want to accelerate wear of your motor, gearbox and battery in exchange for “pushing the limits”. \nWhen activated, Ludicrous Plus is distinguished by a magenta arc on the right hand side of the screen, while on the left are live readouts for battery power, front and rear motor power, and longitudinal acceleration values, both current and peak. \nHow much of a difference does the software update make to the on-road performance of the P100D?
