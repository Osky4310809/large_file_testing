Each one of them knows this workout by heart, because it’s a go-to for days when the gym is overcrowded, you’re traveling, or you just can’t make it to the gym. \nIn it, you do a handful of carefully-chosen exercises at a savage pace. Each exercise delivers a unique fat-burning, muscle-building, and mobility-building stimulus. Indeed, the workout will make you look, feel, and perform like an athlete. \n“28 Minutes” is just one of the 100+ insanely effective workouts featured in my new Men’s Health book Maximus Body , available now. These workouts are featured in the book’s 12- and 26-week fitness programs, which took me a decade to perfectly tune. I’ve never seen them fail. \nDirections: Do the exercises in the order shown. Each exercise is done for 30 seconds, followed by 30 seconds of rest. That’s one round. You’ll do four rounds of the prescribed exercise, rest two minutes, then move onto the next exercise. \nSo, for example, you’d do four rounds of frog hops, rest two minutes, then do four rounds of split jumps, repeating the pattern until you finish the last round of squats. Note: The “rest” for squats is a squat hold. \n1. Frog hop", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:49:54.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
