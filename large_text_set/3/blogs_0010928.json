Reyes, Watsons Phils. group category manager \nSummer just got better. \nJust when you thought you have it all covered, Watsons, Asia’s leading health and beauty retailer, reminds you that there’s more to summer than just skin protection. \nHot on the heels of its “Make Your Summer” campaign launched last month, Watsons stores nationwide piqued the interest of sun worshippers who learned that when it comes to summer essentials, things are not always just skin deep. ADVERTISEMENT \nWatsons summer campaign, an annual festival of indispensable summer products, began in 2008 as a simple skin regimen promotion for beach lovers. Today, with its new, redefined campaign called “Make Your Summer,” things got a little more personal. \n“This year, we are taking a more holistic approach to summer to make it more special,” said Kim C. Reyes, Watsons Phils. group category manager. “From products that protect your skin to slimming products, we have it all covered.” \nPersonalize your summer look by dropping in at any one of its stores nationwide. \nNeed a new look to match your summer palette? “Make Your Summer” carries a line of hair color from Revlon, L’Oreal, and the current hot Japanese brand for hair color, Liese. \nWith Liese Creamy Bubble Hair Color (BHC), Reyes said, DIY hair coloring is as easy as shampooing your hair. Just apply the cream as you would a shampoo, and voila—a new hair color in just 30 minutes (depending on hair length). \nWatsons, in selected store locations, even has Beauty Rooms where you can have your hair analyzed and colored. \nReyes said Watsons’ array of safe and effective slimming products gets you closer to achieving your dream summer hot bod. There are even hair-removal products available so you always look your personal best in your swimwear. ‘Aiming for more’ \n“We want to give our customers a sexier body, more colorful hair, and glowing sun-protected skin this summer. Our summer campaigns have always been successful in getting across the message on how to take care of your skin when the sun is at its hottest. This time we are aiming for more,” she said. \nLast year’s summer campaign saw a 35-percent growth across all brands, she said. \nFor a sun-proof summer, Watsons offers another hot brand from Japan, Biore, which also carries many lighter formulas for sunscreen. Also in store are staple brands Nivea, Vaseline, Banana Boat, Beach Hut, Solstice, Sunplay, Belo, Neutrogena, Cetaphil, Celeteque, Kojie San, Hawaiian Tropic, Dermplus, Ponds and Olay. The Pond’s Skin Analyzer \n“Sun protection is the first step to antiaging,” Reyes said. \nSo while you may be loving that lovely dark tan right now, there will be repercussions as you get older if you don’t wear UVA and UVB skin protection today. This nifty doll turns red when the UV rays are high. \nAs an added bonus, Reyes said, this year, Watsons is giving away five trips for four people to top beach destinations in the country—Boracay, Cebu, Davao, Palawan and Batanes— exclusive to SM Advantage Card Members. Every purchase of P500 worth of any “Make Your Summer” participating brands (single receipt only) earns you one raffle ticket. Promo is ongoing until April 26. \n“We want you to be well-prepared for the summer, and to not only look your best, but be sun-protected throughout summer, as well,” Reyes said. Test as many products as you want. \nWatsons is currently operating over 4,800 stores and more than 1,400 pharmacies in 11 Asian and European markets, including China, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Turkey and Ukraine.
