Child themes are great for making customizations because they allow you to take advantage of powerful features of a parent theme or framework.

This way when you update the parent theme, all your changes will remain intact. \nChild themes are more commonly used with WordPress theme frameworks. These frameworks are robust parent themes that offer a solid base for theme developers to build upon. \nGenesis is one such popular theme framework.
