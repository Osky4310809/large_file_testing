When he opened the cover, he saw a body protruding in the water. He then called his colleagues for help. \nThe police arrived and retrieved the body who was later identified as Berdin. \nCutanda said they had yet to review the footage of the nearby closed circuit television cameras (CCTV) but no one saw how Berdin was able to get inside the septic tank.
