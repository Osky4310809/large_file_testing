But it appears the 5-star property will not be welcoming guests who identify themselves as members of the news media. \nPolitico has published a story saying that one of its reporters was turned away from the luxury accommodations and not allowed to enter the building Wednesday morning for a breakfast meeting. \nThe Politico report quotes an email from the hotel’s director of sales and marketing, explaining, “Media is not allowed in this week in respect of the privacy of our guests.” Advertisement - story continues below Islamic State Makes A New Stunning Move In Syria As Trump Is Weighing His Options To Defeat The Organization \nIt’s widely known that the president-elect’s relationship with the mainstream media has been rocky, at best. News that the incoming administration may move the location of daily White House briefings from the relatively small press room to a much larger space off site set off alarm bells even louder than those that have been sounding for quite a while among a press corps accustomed to privileged access and status. \nThere were also instances where the media cried “foul” when, shortly after his stunning election upset, President-elect Trump ditched reporters in favor of a private dinner with family and friends, in addition to the more recent brouhaha over the president-elect enjoying a round of golf without a pool reporters. \nThe antagonism between Trump and the mainstream media came to a boil only a few days ago when he scolded a CNN correspondent loudly insisting on asking a question and said to him, “You are fake news.” Advertisement - story continues below \nNow, the reported exclusion of news media from the exclusive Trump hotel just blocks from the White House leading up to the inauguration is likely to add to the notion that Trump is at war with the media. There’s no indication, however, that Trump himself or any of his family members was behind the hotel’s decision to show members of the media the virtual “Keep Out” sign. \nTrump and his adult children own the hotel project but not the property, which used to be D.C.’s historic Old Post Office. The General Services Administration still owns the building, in which the Trump organization invested hundreds of millions of dollars for lavish renovations. \nBecause the location is still, technically, federal property, questions are being asked about whether denying a certain group of people — journalists — access to the hotel is legal, or whether it carries the appearance of prejudicial treatment. \nWhile those questions are being asked, and presumably answered, behind the scenes, what happened in full view of everyone outside the Trump International Hotel late Tuesday may provide at least a partial reason for the extraordinary ban on media being inside the building.
