Kinsella's defense lawyer says the mere presence of medication in the boy's blood does not prove she poisoned him. \nKinsella, 36, of Meadville, Mo., about 100 miles northeast of Kansas City, is standing trial this week in St. Louis County Court on charges of first-degree assault and child endangerment. \nIn opening statements Tuesday, Assistant Prosecutor Sheila Whirley said Kinsella's son Patrick spent nearly six months in the hospital and had more 10 blood plasma transfusions and six surgeries. Kinsella is accused of intentionally making her son sick by secretly giving him prescription medication at a home at which she and her son stayed in the 7400 block of Grant Village Drive in Marlborough from March 2014 until the following January when the state took Patrick from her. \nWhirley told jurors Kinsella sought treatment for Patrick at St. Louis Children's Hospital and at Children's Mercy Kansas City to get anti-seizure medications from both without telling doctors at either hospital. \n\"He went from the brink of death to a healthy child,\" Whirley told jurors. \"That's what he is today.\" \nThe boy no longer needs a feeding tube and though he still has epilepsy, he has not had a seizure since he was removed from his mother's custody, Whirley said. \nIn January 2015, Patrick was admitted to St. Louis Children's Hospital in what Dr. Jamie Kondis testified Tuesday as \"almost a comatose state\" along with seizures, hallucinations and a severe loss of coordination. Kondis said lab results revealed three medications not prescribed by doctors at St. Louis Children's Hospital, a combination of which is \"like you're getting an overdose.\" She said Patrick's condition \"was most consistent with abuse.\" \nCharges say Kinsella told police she “accidentally” gave her son the wrong medication \"on occasion,” but doctors told police the types and amount of drugs found in the boy’s system revealed intentional poisoning. The medications were meant to treat mental health and seizures but police have said Kinsella tried to attract attention through her child’s illness in what is known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy . He was placed in protective custody with his paternal grandparents. \nPatrick was born premature in 2005 and had been diagnosed with epilepsy, encephalitis and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Kinsella's lawyer, Gregory Smith, has said Kinsella did not poison her son and that hospitals near Meadville where Kinsella lived were not equipped to handle Patrick's long-term medical problems. He said Patrick had always had a seizure disorder as well as an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation in the brain. \nSmith said the presence of medication in Patrick's system does not prove Kinsella tried to poison him. Kinsella was doing what she could to care for her son's numerous health problems, he said. \nWhirley said Patrick's father died in 2012 without a will, which resulted in the court appointing Patrick's aunt to manage an inheritance for the boy of about $275,000. By keeping Patrick sick, Whirley suggested, Kinsella could receive payments from that inheritance to care for her son. \n\"If (Patrick) died, she would be the likely heir,\" Whirley said. \nKinsella's other lawyer, Bill Grant, told jurors \"we totally disagree\" with Whirley's characterization of the case and said \"there are other sides\" to the story. \nThe trial is expected to close by Friday in St. Louis County Circuit Judge Joseph Dueker's courtroom. \nRachel Kinsella , of Meadville, Mo., was charged with poisoning her 9-year-old son over a period of a year.
