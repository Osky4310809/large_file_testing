At the end of the 11-minute video, the date was revealed... \nAs if that wasn't enough hype, the team dropped an animated short film of all the different house sigils, overlaid with quotes from major Season 7 players. In case you forgot what a tenuous position we left Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Cersi Lannister and the rest in, it all comes flooding backâ€”fast. \nSeason 7 will have seven episodes, down from the usual 10, while Season 8 will have only six. A miniseries, potentially based on A Song of Ice And Fire author George R.R. Martin's short story collection, Tales of Dunk and Egg , is also being considered by HBO. \nGame of Thrones returns Sunday, July 16 at 9 PM EST. \nTo begin getting the gears of Westerosi politics grinding back to life, check out our extensive coverage of the art of Game of Thrones below. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:21:18.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
