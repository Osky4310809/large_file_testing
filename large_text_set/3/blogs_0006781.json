Love this.

The goal is to put public pressure on companies (and in particular, the companies in which SSGA invests ) to increase female leadership . \nWhat’s more, SSGA plans to hold these companies accountable. From Business Insider: \nThe huge money manager said it will vote against boards if a company fails to take steps to increase its female membership. The company plans to send out a letter to 3,500 companies on March 7 asking the companies to take action. \nGender diversity remains a problem for most American companies, despite ample research that shows having women in leadership is a great for a company’s bottom line . Not only that, but corporations with women serving on their board or directors tend to be less embroiled in scandals, fraud, and corruption . \nBut despite all of this, women hold just under 20% of board seats at the U.S.’s biggest companies (despite the ever-increasing purchasing power of female consumers). The case is even more dire for women of color , who only make up 3.1% of all board seats. \nWhile the girl is expected to keep standing for at least a week, here’s hoping her message finally takes root on Wall Street permanently.
