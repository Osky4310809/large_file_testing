Over 100 headstones at Chesed Shel Emeth cemetery were overturned and/or damaged by the vandalism, with many needing to be replaced outright. \nOn Tuesday afternoon, a crowdfunding page showed up to pay for the headstones from a familiar face: Muslim activist and Women’s March co-chair Linda Sarsour , working in conjunction with Tarek El-Messidi of Celebrate Mercy as The goal that she set was $20,000, and that was reached within a few hours. As of this writing, less than a day in, the total is over $77,000 and consistently climbing with every web page refresh. \nSarsour had been quick to condemn the incident on Twitter before starting the crowdfunding page 20 hours later: This is horrible. What kind of sick human being do you have to be to do this?! https://t.co/YnQYJrlLaU \n— Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) February 20, 2017 DONATE WHAT YOU CAN.
