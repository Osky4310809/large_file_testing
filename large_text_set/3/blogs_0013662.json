Krauthammer said Trump seems to believe in conspiracy theories and is undermining his credibility. TUCKER CARLSON: I think that it's likely that it is overwhelmingly likely that electronic communications from Trump advisers were swept up by American intelligence agencies during the campaign, either for good reasons or for bad. But I think it likely happened, but I think the White House is unwilling to prove it distracts from that, it undermines their case but also detracts from the conversation we should be having with surveillance. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER: It makes you question the credibility of the president on anything. He really should stop digging. We have now had the heads of the Senate and House intelligence communities, Democrat and Republican come out and say they haven't seen a shred of evidence that this is true, there is nobody in the administration who will say this is true. They'll all say we have to investigate. Why? As you said in the question . You're the president, you pick up the phone, you call the CIA, the FBI, the DNI... you've got the answer at your fingertips. You don't need an investigation. Look, there's not a person in Washington who thinks that there actually was a wiretap, that this is true. Look, he seems to have a belief in conspiracy theories. This is after all a man who said that Ted Cruz's father was involved in some way with Lee Harvey Oswald. That's pretty Twilight Zone stuff. So this is a lot less kooky than that. But there is no evidence. But as you said, it detracts from the fact that we do know that there was legal wiretapping of Russian officials that might have swept up Americans in it. I would go one step beyond that, there could have been improper handling -- when Americans are swept up in that kind of legal wiretapping of a foreigner, the intelligence agencies are supposed to cover up and to disguise the identity of the American to protect them. There could have been mishandling of this particularly in the case of General Flynn and that is I think an issue ought to be be raised.
