Teens & Girls Published Updated 11:27 am EDT, March 24, 2017 1 Comment By Jessica McBride 4.5k Share Tweet Follow Shani Burriss More than a dozen Washington D.C. teens are missing from the nation's capital, police in that city say. But there's very important context to consider. That was the number as of March 23, 2017; it changes constantly as more youths are found and go missing. Indeed, by the time you read this, it's likely that more teens have been reported missing, and more teens were located from the list and subsequent photos. The issue has generated massive attention on social media as people express concern that the media and police are downplaying missing D.C. teens. However, it appears that police purposely have courted more public exposure on each case, publicizing them in a way they did not do before. In so doing, they have sparked attention on an issue that they say is a constant concern but has not increased. Acting Police Chief Peter Newsham told the television station that “the year-over-year number of missing persons, including juveniles, has held steady, and that there is no known link in D.C. now between missing people and human trafficking.” In a press conference, which police posted on Periscope, the chief said that people go missing for many reasons but vowed to do everything to locate the teens. Some are runaways and dealing with family problems, he noted. The missing teens are not believed to have all met with foul play or to be connected. The mayor, Muriel Bowser, was also present at the press conference on March 16, and she said, “The number of missing person reports has remained constant…what has changed is getting that information out quickly. There is no evidence to suggest there has been an increase in missing persons.” Chanel Dickerson, commander of the division in charge of investigating the missing teens, appears to be the police official who spearheaded the recent highlighted exposure, in part by publicizing the missing teen cases on social media. She said in the press conference: “Let me first reassure you. We have no indication to believe that young girls in the district are being preyed upon by human traffickers in large numbers.” Dickerson said that, out of 708 missing persons reports in 2017, only 34 remain open. “We have no reason to believe the 34 missing cases are related,” she said. Some of those 34 involve adults. Despite the context, authorities and families are seeking the missing teens and concerned about their welfare. You can scroll through the missing teen alerts in D.C. posted on the police website for 2017 as of March 23. If you have any information about the teens, contact the D.C. police.
