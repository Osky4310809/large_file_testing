Joas Pramis, public affairs officer of the Army’s 9th Infantry Division, said a platoon led by 1/Lt. April John del Rosario was conducting combat operation at about 6:30 a.m. when they clashed with communist guerrillas. \nPramis said four rebels were killed during the 20-minute firefight and the soldiers recovered two M-16 rifles, two M-14 rifles, an M-203 rifle grenade launcher, an improvised explosive device, two handheld radios, a hand grenade, assorted ammunition and magazines and communist propaganda materials. \nCol. Fernando Trinidad, commander of the 903rd Infantry Brigade, said the bodies of the slain rebels were brought to a morgue in Aroroy town proper. \n“Our troops are also verifying the complaints of poor farmers in the barangay of extortion by NPA rebels,” said Trinidad. \nIn Ifugao, a soldier and several NPA guerrillas were reportedly wounded during clashes in Asipulo town on Sunday evening.   \nThe Army’s 54th Infantry Battalion said the encounter lasted for more than an hour in Barangay Namal. \nArmy Captain Jefferson Somera, civil military operations officer of the 54th IB, said government troops seized one rifle left by the retreating rebels who carried their wounded companions. \nCol. Edgard Arevalo, chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Public Affairs Office, said six NPA members were captured by members of the Army’s 73rd Infantry Battalion following an encounter in Sarangani. \nHe identified the rebels as Simeon Salda, Jun Moda, Claude Palbe, Garzon Palbe, Rene Ompao and Sabelo Colano. \nArevalo said the NPA is suffering tactical defeat since the AFP launched an all-out war against them nine days ago. \nArevalo claimed that while the National Democratic Front continues to push for the resumption of peace negotiations, it is clear that they are losing hold on their men on the ground. – With Michael Punongbayan, Jose Rodel Clapano, Artemio Dumlao, Cet Dematera, Raymund Catindig, Francis Elevado", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:36:45.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
