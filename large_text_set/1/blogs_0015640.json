The cult classic horror series is capping its recent resurgence—which saw a remastered version of the original, as well as the series finale Phantasm: Ravager , hitting theaters in late 2016—with a six-disc Blu-ray set. That’s all five films, plus a whole disc of special features. \nPhantasm creator Don Coscarelli shared the news with Entertainment Weekly , promising “new bonus content bringing together cast and crew to look back and celebrate the Phantasm franchise including commentaries and new featurettes.” It’s very likely one of those featurettes will pay tribute to actor Angus Scrimm, who played the iconic Tall Man in the films, and passed away just over a year ago.
