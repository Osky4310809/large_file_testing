John Kasich (R) also floated the idea of reducing the number of people on Medicaid. The ACA insured people up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level through Medicaid; Kasich suggested covering people up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level, and then putting the rest on the exchanges.\nWhen asked if he could guarantee that everyone covered under ACA wouldn't lose their insurance in his state, Kasich was frank.\n\"I can't guarantee anything. I'm down here trying to do my best,\" he said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T02:02:52.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
