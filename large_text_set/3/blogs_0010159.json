By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 15, 2017 11:58 AM Former Uttar Pradesh Minister Gayatri Prajapati was arrested from Lucknow in connection with a gang-rape case by the state police. (PTI image) \nFormer Uttar Pradesh Minister Gayatri Prajapati was arrested from Lucknow in connection with a gang-rape case by the state police. The Samajwadi Party leader was absconding since February 27. Earlier, Prajapati was booked on a Supreme Court directive and an FIR was lodged on February 17 against the minister and six others for allegedly gang-raping a woman and alleged attempt to rape her minor daughter. The apex court had asked the UP Police to submit an action taken report regarding the incidents in eight weeks. A Look Out notice was issued against him as also a Non-Bailable Warrant. His passport too has been impounded. Airports across the country have been alerted about the possibility of Prajapati trying to flee the country. In the just-concluded Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Prajapati lost to BJP from Amethi, the seat he held. But his arrest was nothing short of an intriguing one. Here is blow by blow account. \n# Gayatri Prajapati was arrested from Aashiyana area of Lucknow early this morning after remaining absconding for nearly a month. \n# According to reports, he was in Kolkata in the morning. \nWatch this video \n# Director General of Police (DGP) of Uttar Pradesh Javeed Ahmed told India Today that Prajapati did not ‘surrender’. He was arrested after receiving inputs from various forces, Ahmed said. \n# He is likely to be produced before the POCSO Court later in the day Senior Superintendent of Police, Lucknow, Manzil Saini said. \n# Police had yesterday interrogated the SP leader’s two sons and nephew to get some inputs regarding his whereabouts. \n# State police yesterday had three accomplices of the SP leader. Yesterday’s arrests were made in Hazratganj area in central Lucknow, IG (Lucknow) A Satish Ganesh told PTI. With this, all the six persons named in the FIR against the 49-year-old SP leader have been picked up. \n# Political slugfest has begun following the arrest. Former Uttar Pradesh chief of BJP Laxmi Kant Bajpai accused Akhilesh Yadav of safeguarding Prajapati. \n# Reacting to the arrest of the SP leader, BJP leader Vijay Bahadur Pathak said the “State police was till now politicised. As soon as it has been freed from political pressures it has started performing resulting in the arrest”. \n(With agency inputs)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T08:37:05.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
