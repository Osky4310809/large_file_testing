Sure, sometimes, something with an incredibly unspecific name can still end up being a real success , but usually you want a title that tells you what the show is, but isn’t corny or anything. Let’s take a look at some of the shows that failed this rather simple test. Here are the worst names TV shows have ever had. Scrotal Recall \nThis show has since had its title changed to… well, literally anything else would’ve been better. Even the title This Certainly Isn’t Called \"Scrotal Recall\" would’ve been a less god-awful title. GCB (aka Good Christian Bitches) \n(source) \nSo, obviously they called this show GCB since you can’t have the word \"bitch\" in the title of a national television show. But just shortening it to its initials still let’s everyone know that the show is, for all intents and purposes, still called Good Christian Bitches , and it created all of the protest and outrage that you’d expect. But GCB also lacks the bite that the title would have if they'd just embraced it. (And the original title is actually very good — it’s snappy, clever, and tells us exactly what to expect from the show.) Are You There, Chelsea? \n(source) \nAre You There, Chelsea? is based on Chelsea Handler’s bestseller \"Are You There Vodka? It’s Me, Chelsea\", which I guess the network thought was too long? Fair enough, but shortening it, and then hacking it up so that it no longer makes sense seems insane. I mean, so much of Chelsea Handler’s persona was built around drinking that they should've at least kept the vodka part in there? Maybe it was too controversial to have a sitcom that took place in a bar have the name of an alcohol anywhere in the title? The Knights of Prosperity \n(source) \nThe Knights of Prosperity was about robbing rich people (they original titled it \"Let’s Rob (Various Celebrities Here)\") but instead, they gave it the title of a show which is about medieval knights who are also in the banking industry, I guess? Love Monkey \nOh cool, a show about an ape who f*cks! Happy Endings \nOh cool, a show about getting a tug job at the end of an illegal massage! Any show with \"Man\" in its name \n(source) \nMan Up , Last Man Standing , We Are Men — these titles tell us nothing about the show except that there is at least one (1) man in it. Imagine that — a world where men are the stars of TV shows! \nPlease consult me before naming any kind of television show.
