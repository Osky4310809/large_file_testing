Guy Reschenthaler of Jefferson Hills told KDKA political editor Jon Delano.\nReschenthaler says this is a manufactured crisis.\n“The governor did not necessarily have to shut down those call centers.”\nReschenthaler says the funding was to upgrade computers and phone technology, not pay workers.\n“We want accountability before we spend taxpayers money for these upgrades that may or may not occur.”\nBut Goulet insists, “We provided ample substantiation for the plans, what had been done, what improvements have been made.”\nSo far, no one in Harrisburg seems to be working for a solution which leaves people like Middleton up the creek. \nReschenthaler says he’s willing to help.\n“Come to us. and what we’re going to do is we’re going to take your information and we will fax that to Labor & Industry, and Labor & Industry has to within 72 hours respond to our constituent.”\nJoin The Conversation On The KDKA Facebook Page \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:58:48.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
