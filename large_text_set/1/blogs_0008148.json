He is very strong in mentality and he coped well in the situation. \n\"He was not afraid the next match after Everton to come to the game again. \n\"He was phenomenal against Reading [last Saturday's 4-0 FA Cup win]. He knows that he is a very important player for me.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:14:55.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
