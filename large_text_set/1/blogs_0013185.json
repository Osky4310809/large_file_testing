Before our president-elect started sharing his every thought (in 140 characters or less), one man in particular actually used the social media platform to reach, uplift, and empower his constituents, rather than just to gripe. Cory Booker practically pioneered the idea back when he was mayor of Newark, and today he still actively tweets (in fact, maybe just as frequently as the president-elect), sending out positive and politically sound messages from his post as a New Jersey senator. Today, Booker’s voice was being heard in another, far more pressing context, as he testified against Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. He joined Representative Cedric Richmond and civil rights hero Representative John Lewis in encouraging the confirmation committee to oppose Sessions’s appointment amid allegations that he’s exhibited racism while in office for the last 20 years Just before Booker testified, he sent out a tweet quoting American author Ella Wheeler Wilcox: “To sin by silence, when they should protest, makes cowards of men.” In two separate tweets hours earlier, he quoted Malala Yousafzai, “There comes a moment you have to decide: Do you keep quiet or do you stand up”; and Martin Luther King, Jr., “Not only will we have to repent for the sins of bad people; but we also will have to repent for the appalling silence of good people.” (Trump’s last tweet today ? It ended with, “Are we living in Nazi Germany?”) There’s no comparing, but while Trump’s tweeting has become his headline-grabbing “thing, ” Booker’s approach is one that we can only hope the president-elect might one day pay attention to. The senator, who said today that “ in the choice of standing with Senate norms or standing up for what my conscience tells me is best for our country, I will always choose my conscience and country ,” the typical response to the insults hurled his way by his critics are words like : “And you are another beautiful, promising, fellow American Citizen. May we both see each other’s peaks as well as valleys.” When referencing a sometime opponent in the political sphere, Booker types things like : “We often disagree but we both love America.” He manages to be, dare we say it, politically savvy . For a political feed that includes policy and not pettiness, take a scroll through the senator’s account here . Here’s hoping some of his colleagues join in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:49:56.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
