Taking cues from midcentury design, naturally, the single-story residence incorporates signature characteristics from the era, like a gently sloping, overhanging roof, walls of windows, and a free-flowing layout that promotes cross breezes and that quintessential indoor-outdoor lifestyle. The expansive great room features beamed, slightly sloping ceilings and encompasses a kitchen and living and dining areas—all of which open onto a large covered terrace and the oak-tree dotted lot on which it is sited by way of sliding glass doors. The master suite—one of three bedrooms—also boasts floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding glass doors that connect directly to the outside. Interior finishes have been kept clean and simple. Floors are terrazzo in the common spaces, and wood in the private quarters. The 3,603-square-foot home is clad in white stucco as well as composite siding made of recycle materials that resembles wood but is better able to withstand the sunny climate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:15:41.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
