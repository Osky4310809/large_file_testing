Some believe that’s why her use of a private email server to conduct government business went unnoticed. \nThe Department of the Interior (DOI) has operated without a permanent IG the longest — since Feb. 23, 2009, according to POGO. \nWith the thousands of appointments a new president has to make, filling IG vacancies isn’t usually a priority. The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) thinks it should be. \n“Although the IG has the potential to significantly improve the performance of each agency, the IG may not be among the first positions that transition teams or the new administration act to fill when taking office,” CIGIE’s handbook on presidential transitions says. “However, it is important for the new administration to focus on filling vacant IG positions expeditiously. \n“In the past, IG positions have often remained vacant for significant periods of time, generating concern and criticism. Although acting IGs have performed admirably in many cases, a confirmed IG is in a much better position to effectively fulfill the responsibilities of the office.” \nPermanent IGs have more independence than acting IGs, and thus, are in a better position to defy their agencies when necessary, Pacifico explained. \nObama isn’t the only reason for all those vacancies. In many of the current IG vacancy cases, the Senate didn’t confirm Obama’s choices. The Senate never confirmed Obama’s June 2015 pick for DOI IG, Mary Kendall. Kendall’s critics in the Senate said she politicized investigations as DOI’s acting IG. \nIGs don’t have terms, and historically, stay on through presidential transitions. \nPacifico said IGs become increasingly important whenever one party controls the White House, Senate and House. \n“IGs are nonpartisan, and it becomes more important when aspects of government are very partisan,” Pacifico told TheDCNF. \nSouth Carolina Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s pick to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), emphasized the vital role of IGs in his confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He said he looks forward to “reinvigorating” IG offices and “giving them the respect and credibility that they need.” \n“Congress needs to have those inspectors general, the president needs to have those inspectors general, doing their job and helping us collect information so that we can make good decisions about how to fix and reform various institutions,” Mulvaney said. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
