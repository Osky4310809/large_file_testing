It would force a number of reforms to the city’s old planning system, and it would impose a two-year moratorium on any buildings that don’t comply with the city’s General Plan, which is like the bible for development. \nSupporters say LA is overdeveloped. They argue developers have too much influence on elected officials, who approve amendments to the General Plan.\nBut Measure S would not keep special interests out of City Hall, and housing experts warn a freeze would worsen LA’s affordability crisis. There’s not enough housing to keep up with demand, and they say, it can not afford to stop building new units—even temporarily. \nThere’s a lot at stake. \nWe’re tracking results as they trickle in.
