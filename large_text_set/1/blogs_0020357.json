Maybe I shouldn’t be saying that right now, but I owe it to the fans. \n“Sheikh Mansour is approaching this year — as every other year, but ­particularly this year — with a lot of expectations. And I am working very hard to make sure that together with Pep – with our management team, the rest of our organisation – we’re going to do everything possible to make sure this team is well set for a hugely successful season.” \nThose words came back to haunt Khaldoon after ­Guardiola admitted City’s title hopes were over after the 4-0 h­umiliation at Everton last week. Sheikh Mansour ditched Pellegrini because fourth wasn't good enough (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nHis reign began with a brilliant 10-match winning streak, but the realisation that the squad he inherited is past its sell-by date has long dawned on the 46-year-old former Barcelona and Bayern boss. \nAnd while there is an acceptance inside the Etihad’s corridors of power that Guardiola must be given time to impose his philosophy on the club, there is a huge sense of frustration that City still rely on 30-somethings such as Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva, Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy. \nThat is despite Begiristain ­sanctioning around £511million in new signings since arriving at the club in the autumn of 2012. \nCity failed with an attempt to lure Guardiola to Manchester earlier that year and the club realised the best way to recruit the manager of their dreams would be to employ the two executives who played key roles at Barca when he was there. \nFerran Soriano ­became chief ­executive in September 2012 and a month later was joined by Begiristain, a close friend of Guardiola. Begiristain has spent over half a billion pounds on signings in four years (Photo: Getty) \nOne of their first tasks was to sack manager Roberto Mancini at the end of that season – after the Italian had finished second in the Premier League and reached the FA Cup final a year after delivering the title. \nBegiristain has wasted millions in the transfer market. \nOf the 28 players he has bought, only Kevin de Bruyne and Fernandinho have significantly improved the team. \nWhile Begiristain has also recouped just over £140m in player sales, the sorry state of his ­recruitment process was ­illustrated when he sent big-money signings Eliaquim Mangala, Samir Nasri and Wilfried Bony out on loan last summer — as well as England’s No.1 keeper Joe Hart. \nThat scattergun transfer policy is now threatening to derail Guardiola’s first season.

These two are equally important and neither compromises the other or is at the cost of the other.” poll loading Will Manchester City win the Premier League under Pep Guardiola? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:45:22.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
