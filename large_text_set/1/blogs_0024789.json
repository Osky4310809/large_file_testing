The ditty titled, Mere Piya Gaye England , features Kangana Ranaut showing her dance moves, dressed in a desi avatar , while gyrating to yesteryear's track Mere Piya Gaye Rangoon (some alternations were made to the lyrics). The song is a tribute to the above mentioned popular number from the 1940's. \nThe lyrics of this new song have been penned by Gulzar, and it has been sung by crooner Rekha Bhardwaj. The lyrics, to be fair, are funny and includes names of popular leaders (for all the wrong reasons) like Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill. \nThe trailer of the film released on January 6 and was hugely appreciated. Directed by National Award winning filmmaker, Vishal Bharadwaj, the period drama starring Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan and Kangana Ranaut, is set against the backdrop of World War II. \nShahid plays a soldier in the film, while Saif plays a filmmaker and mentor to a film star named Julia, which is played by Kangana. Rangoon is set to hit the screens on February 24.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T08:22:38.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
