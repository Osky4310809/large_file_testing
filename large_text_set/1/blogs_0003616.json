Brown then extended the drama by offering his own social media posts where he threatened to “beat dat a–” and also alleged that Soulja Boy had created an “imaginary beef.” \nIn a screenshot posted on The Shade Room account, Tran weighed in on the feud, saying, “I just… okay.. First off this drama between the both of these two is so ridiculous it makes no sense. We just brought in a new year and this what we doing? Leave the extra’d out, rah rah shi behind. This isn’t cool or funny.. it’s draining.. not just for me.. but everyone. There’s so much more out there in life then ‘twitter beefs.'” \nBrown responded with several Instagram posts, including a screenshot of a lengthy, capitalized rant, calling Karrueche “2 yrs famous.” Things got personal when Brown added, “ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU WAS CHRIS BROWNS GIRL! AND THE OTHER FRIENDS YOU STILL TALK TO…. I F–KED.” \nIn a separate Instagram post, Brown redirected his focus to Soulja Boy, offering, “Boy better go to sleep.( no more corny media sh-t… WE GONE LINE IT UP! Say NO MORE OR SAY WHAT U WANT! I’m gone beat dat ass regardless. I’m done talking for today.” \nDespite his word, Brown dedicated two more posts to Soula Boy, saying in one clip, “Put your video out Soulja,” referring to the alleged FaceTime call. In the other, the singer posted a photo of presumably Soulja Boy’s hand with the caption: “When the rigamortis set in. NOW THESE ARE THE HANDS OF A DRUG ADDICT. WHEN DOES HIS NAIL START? before the knuckle? Staph and I’m not talking about the people I employ!” \n— \nA video posted by 1 YOU ❤️ 2 HATE (@chrisbrownofficial) on Jan 3, 2017 at 11:59am PST \nnew music", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:47:11.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
