Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp discuss By Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp Last Updated: 05/03/17 8:15pm Sergio Aguero scored the opener for Man City at Sunderland, but where does his future lie? Jamie Redknapp would not be surprised if Sergio Aguero was not at Manchester City next season, but Graeme Souness says City should not sell the Argentine. \nAguero struck the vital first goal for Pep Guardiola's side in the 2-0 win over Sunderland on Nissan Super Sunday , his fifth goal in three games. \nIt remains to be seen whether Aguero is in Guardiola's long-term plans at City after the latter took charge of the club in the summer, and Redknapp sees Aguero at another club next season. Pep Guardiola dropped Aguero earlier this year for Gabriel Jesus \nRedknapp said on Super Sunday : \"The Sergio Aguero debate will go on, make no mistake. At the end of the season I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't at Man City. \n\"That's not to say he's not a great player, I'm just not so sure he fits the identity of what Pep wants at City. \n\"But he will score plenty of goals, and if they are going to make sure they get into the top four this season they need his goals, because he is a special talent, and you could see that today, he made the difference with that first goal. Jesus received a long-term injury against Bournemouth in mid-February \n\"Next year, when Pep gets everyone fit, is Aguero going to be OK with coming in and out of the team?\" \nThe 28-year-old, so often City's go-to man, was dropped earlier in the year for new signing Gabriel Jesus, but has proved his worth in recent weeks after the Brazilian received a long-term injury. \nSouness says Aguero is special, a piece of the City jigsaw that should not be underestimated, and insists the striker position is the hardest to fill at any club. Sunderland 0-2 Man City \nHe said: \"He is special. City had a lot of the ball but weren't really peppering the Sunderland goal before the first goal. But his movement for that goal, that's real cute play as a striker. \n\"You can have all that ball, but you might need someone special to get that goal, and he does that time and time again for them, he is that kind of striker. \n\"It looks like Pep is a real communicator; I'm sure he's sat Aguero down and said 'this is where you can improve.' It doesn't matter what age you are you can always improve. Guardiola was delighted with his side's improved performance against Sunderland \n\"One of them would be, and we've witnessed it today, him sprinting to people, putting them under pressure. It's not too late for him to learn and play the way Guardiola wants, because he is such a special player, you'd try to keep a hold of him and try to change him. \n\"You wouldn't want to sell him full stop. People like him, it's the hardest position to fill, those who score at the hardest to find, and he gets the big goals.\" \nManchester City host Stoke on Wednesday night looking to make it five victories in a row in the Premier League, live on Sky Sports 1 .
