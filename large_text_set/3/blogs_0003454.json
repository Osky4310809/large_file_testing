Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro with 5.2-inch display, 16MP selfie camera and 4GB RAM goes official By March 7, 2017 “The Galaxy C5 Pro is a compelling smartphone with 64GB storage and an octa-core SoC” \nThe Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro has been the subject of a number of leaks and reports in the past couple of weeks. Well… today, the company has quietly unveiled the phone in China, and listed the phone on its website in the country. \nThe Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro sports a premium metal unibody design with a three-line split antenna design, just like the Galaxy C9 Pro ( review ). The phone gets a fingerprint sensor, which is integrated into the home button of the device. You can also use the home button / fingerprint sensor to work with Samsung Pay, which has recently been launched in India . \nAs for the other specs, the Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro gets a 5.2-inch full HD Super AMOLED display, and boots Android Marshmallow. The phone is powered by a 2.2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, mated to a beefy 4GB of RAM. The storage capacity on board also quite generous at 64GB. There’s also a microSD card slot that lets you expand the storage further. \nThe camera department on the Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro includes a 16MP shooter with f/1.9 aperture and full HD video recording support. The Galaxy C series is known for featuring impressive selfie cameras, and the Galaxy C5 Pro doesn’t disappoint in that aspect, at least on paper. So, the front camera also sports a resolution of 16-megapixels. As for the connectivity features, the device gets 4G LTE, dual-SIM slots, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC and GPS options. A 2,600mAh battery keeps the package alive. \nUnfortunately, Samsung hasn’t mentioned the price of the Galaxy C5 Pro on its website. However, earlier reports had suggested that the device could be priced around RMB 2,499, which roughly converts to Rs 24,000. Similar to the earlier Galaxy C series offerings, the C5 Pro will be available in a range of hues including Lake Blue, Maple Leaf and Powder Rose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:45:53.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
