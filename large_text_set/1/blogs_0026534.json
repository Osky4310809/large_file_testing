He was arrested after parking his car on a nearby bridge and surrendering to authorities, police said.\nOn Monday evening, Bissonnette was charged with six counts of murder.\n“For the moment, nothing leads us to believe there are other suspects linked to the event, but you’ll understand we’re not taking chances and we’re making necessary verifications to make sure there aren’t any,” Quebec police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe told The Canadian Press.\nAuthorities say they are investigating the attack as an act of terrorism.\nView this image ›\nBissonnette’s Facebook page Facebook\nID: 10429072 According to his Facebook page, which has since been taken offline, Bissonnette lived in the Cap-Rouge section of Quebec City and attended the Universite Laval. At the university, Bissonnette studied political science and anthropology, La Presse reported . An unidentified fellow student told La Presse that Bissonnette was “a loner” with no friends.\nAfter Bissonnette’s name and photo began to show up in the media in connection with the shooting, Canadian immigration activist François Deschamps told La Presse he recognized Bissonnette as “a troll” who had made “extreme right-wing” comments on a Facebook page that Deschamps created for welcoming Syrian refugees to Canada.\nVincent Boissoneault, another friend of Bissonnette, described him to The Globe And Mail as a “xenophobe” and said he was “enthralled by a borderline racist nationalist movement.”\nBoissoneault said that when the two would argue about politics that Bissonnette “attacked refugees or expressed support” for right wing politicians including far-right French nationalist and presidential candidate Marie Le Pen and US President Donald Trump.\nView this image ›\nCanadian police officers respond to a shooting in a mosque at the Québec City Islamic cultural center on Sainte-Foy Street in Quebec city on January 29, 2017. Alice Chiche / AFP / Getty Images\nID: 10429090 Before Facebook deactivated Bissonnette’s page, screenshots of his “likes” were also circulated on social media. Among them were page for Le Pen, Trump, and atheist and critic of Islam Richard Dawkins.\nPosts on Bissonnette’s own Facebook page, however, reveal little about any political or ideological leanings. For example, his profile shows a post of him at a Subway restaurant, driving in a car, with the caption “driving to my camping ground!” A screengrab from the computer game Warcraft, and a photo of a dog wearing a Dominos pizza delivery outfit, with the caption, “I want one! #fridayfeeling.”\nView this image ›\nBissonnette Facebook\nID: 10429078 At a news conference Monday, officials identified the shooting victims as men ranging in age from 35 to 60. Officials said five people remain hospitalized, with two in critical condition and three stable. At least 14 others suffered minor injuries, Genevieve Dupuis, a spokeswoman for the University of Quebec Hospital Centre, said.\nA motive for the attack remains unclear, and law enforcement offered few details about the suspected attacker other than that he told police he intends to cooperate with the investigation.\nThe White House said Trump spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Monday and “offered to provide any assistance as needed.”\nDuring his daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer used the attack to justify Trump’s controversial travel ban for immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, calling it “a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.”\nTrudeau, meanwhile, spoke directly to Muslim Canadians from the House of Commons Monday, saying they have the country’s full support.\n“To the more than one million Canadians who profess the Muslim faith, I want to say directly, we are with you,” he said. “Thirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours. Know that we value you. You enrich our country in immeasurable ways, this is your home.”\n“We will grieve with you, we will defend you, we will love you, and we will stand with you.”\n4.\n6 People Were Killed In A Shooting At A Canadian Mosque\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10429082", "external_links": ["http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-city-mosque-attack-suspect-known-for-right-wing-online-posts/article33833044/", "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/multiple-deaths-injuries-mosque-shooting-quebec-city-canada-n713976", "http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/justice-et-faits-divers/201701/30/01-5064449-attentat-a-quebec-la-sq-confirme-un-seul-suspect.php"], "published": "2017-01-31T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:13:25.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
