Could   \nWhich is the strongest – the desire a woman feels to become a mother? Or the pull of a relationship with the man she loves? That’s the heart-wrenching dilemma facing Toyah Battersby in Coronation Street this week. \nEver since the Weatherfield favourite returned to the cobbles at the end of last year, she’s been having an illicit romance with stepsister Leanne’s ex Peter Barlow. When the cabbie tells her he doesn’t want any more kids, childless Toyah is devastated. \nShe’s thrown into further turmoil when her estranged hubby Toby calls. \nHe tells her the fertility clinic has been in touch about the future of their frozen embryos, and suggests they give their marriage one more shot. Toby wants a fresh start with ex Toyah (Photo: ITV) Read More Coronation Street Nick Tilsley's most EXPLOSIVE exits revealed as the character is axed... again \nToyah is unable to contain her emotions. When she sees Leanne and Eva at the spa, she breaks down and finally confesses her longing for kids and the agony of her fruitless years trying for a baby with Toby. Things come to a head later in the week when Leanne takes it upon herself to try to sort out her sister’s love life. \nStill in the dark about the identity of Toyah’s mystery man, Leanne secretly replies to a text from ‘Fred’ on Toyah’s mobile, inviting him round to the flat. When the visitor arrives on the doorstep, Leanne is bemused to find her ex-husband standing there. Will she twig? And how will she react? \nWe chat to Georgia Taylor, who plays Toyah, about the difficult decisions that are facing her character... \nDid Toyah think Peter would want children with her? \nShe hasn’t been candid. Initially their affair was about escaping the stress of the IVF. It was exciting, she didn’t want to talk about the baby quest. It’s only now they’re together the issue has come to the fore. \nIs she tempted to try again with Toby? \nToby turns up offering her everything. Peter isn’t, but he’s the one she really loves. She and Toby have history but she’s moved on, and she’s not in love with him. \nWhat does Leanne make of Toyah’s fertility problems? \nLeanne feels a bit humiliated and doubts their closeness as Toyah hadn’t shared this with her before. \nIn real life Jane Danson, who plays Leanne, is one of my best friends. Even though we’re acting it’s still my friend that might be upset or screaming at me, so hopefully it makes it feel more true. \nShould Toyah stick with Peter? \nI like working with Chris Gascoyne, so from a very selfish point of view I hope they stay together! I think they genuinely love each other and she believes that Peter’s turned over a new leaf – he’s been sober for over two years now. The viewers know how much of a womaniser Peter has been over the years, and obviously Toyah knows a bit of that through Leanne, but she doesn’t know all of it. Leanne would think Peter is not good enough for Toyah. Bride before a fall Jenny (right) at the factory (Photo: ITV) \nLooking like the cat that got the cream, Jenny shows the factory girls her engagement ring. She’s telling anyone who’ll listen how getting wed to the Underworld boss is going to be every bride’s dream. \nBut when Kate returns from Bali she’s not impressed – and warns Johnny he could end up penniless if he’s not careful. \nJenny continues to get her feet under the table, coming up with a design for bras for women who’ve had a mastectomy. By the end of the week Kate has had enough. Kev's feeling the heat Tyrone and Kevin clash (Photo: ITV) \nThe Street’s resident mechanic Kevin Webster is known for suffering more than his fair share of ups and downs. Now desperate times call for desperate measures for the father of two. \nWhen Tyrone makes it clear he still thinks it’s Kevin’s fault they are in a financial mess, the pair come to blows. \nAt home, Kevin tells Anna the insurance company is refusing to pay out as the garage fire looks to have been arson – and he’s the main suspect. She offers to return to work and help out, but Kevin suggests she sues David Platt to get compensation for her injuries instead. Although Anna is not happy about making a claim, she wants to help out so she agrees. \nWhat she doesn’t know is that Kevin has accepted £7,000 towards Sophie’s medical bill from his ex Sally. When the truth comes out at the end of the week, Kevin gets it in the neck from all angles.
