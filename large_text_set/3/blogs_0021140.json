Rep. Jason Chaffetz was shocked by video of the March 10 incident. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nChaffetz says the surveillance video is shocking … the intruder was not darting around. Rather, he was “lingering,”“hanging out” on the grounds. At one point he took the time to bend down and tie his shoes. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nThe intruder at times peered through windows of the building, where Trump was inside. As we previously reported, he also jiggled a doorknob . googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nChaffetz says some of the alarms failed but some went off, yet the intruder was not detected. \nThe man from the March 10 incident, Jonathan Tran, wasn’t actually caught until he announced himself to a guard at the South Portico entrance, claiming he had an appointment with President Donald Trump. \nAs we reported, sensors had been removed from the fence area that Tran jumped which added to the failure of detection. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:16:25.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
