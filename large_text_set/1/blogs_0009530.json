Others may call them heroes. \nLet’s face it: Rent in Manhattan is ridiculously expensive. If you can figure out a way to get out of paying it, all power (and thousands upon thousands of saved dollars) to ya. \nNourse and Bennett live in a loft in Chelsea on 26th Street. This particular area is filled with art galleries and creative businesses. It’s a cool place to be. \nThe building is also right next to the High Line, which many New Yorkers consider to be the only tourist site worth visiting without actual tourists in tow. Google Earth \nThe building is mostly not residential, which is how the couple, who have two children and run a video content company called KZ Films, have been getting away with not paying rent for so long. Aside from their apartment, the building mostly houses galleries and businesses. \nThe couple was paying $4,754.02, but stop paying that in 2010, according to a lawsuit, the New York Post reported. \nSo with six years’ worth of rent plus electric charges, the landlord says they now owe $410,000. \nBut Nourse and Bennett are fighting it. LinkedIn \nThey say that they do not have to pay the hundreds of thousands of dollars in back rent because of the Loft Law . \nThe Loft Law is supposed to protect New York residents living illegally in commercial and factory buildings. \nIn 2010, the state changed the Loft Law to cover more people. This is when Nourse and Bennett stopped paying their rent. Google Earth \nMargaret Sandercock, the couple’s lawyer, told the Post, \nThis building does not comply with the Loft Law. \nThe owner is not entitled to collect rent and my clients are not required to pay rent. \nHarry Shapiro, the landlord’s lawyer, said that the family can stay in the building should they pay their rent. He said, \nWe really don’t want to evict them. We just want them to pay the rent. They’re getting all the services but the landlord got zippo. \nThe creatives fight on. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
