According to The New York Times , the warrant had to do with a link between a Russian bank and a Trump Organization server. It was later determined there was nothing untoward involving the link. \nHowever, Bongino thinks that there’s another possibility. \nHere’s what I think the media is missing and what could be going on with this wire-tapping of Trump Tower story. A former Secret Service agent’s perspective. #TrumpTower \nPosted by Daniel Bongino on Saturday, March 4, 2017 \n“The Secret Service does ECM sweeps, electronic counter-measures, where they go in frequently and look for listening devices, radio frequencies, all kinds of things to make sure the president or president-elect is not being, in fact, wiretapped or listened in on on specific phone lines,” Bongino said in the Sunday video.

Therefore, Bongino believed it was possible that Secret Service agents found the bugs during one of their searches. \n“That makes total sense, but of course, the media’s not really interested in the story, because they want to find fault with Trump,” Bongino said. “So their story’s gonna be, ‘Did Trump force the FBI to tell him he was being monitored in some kind of an investigation?’ \n“They’ve never considered the third option, that he had Secret Service protection and there was likely an ECM sweep done to check for bugs. The FBI’s not going to tell the Secret Service if they’re monitoring the president-elect, and if Obama or his DOJ officials wanted Trump monitored, the Secret Service probably didn’t know at all.” Advertisement - story continues below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:51:45.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
