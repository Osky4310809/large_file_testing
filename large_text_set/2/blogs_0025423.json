But, fair warning, if you want to go into Season 7 as blind as Maester Aemon, then definitely stop reading here because there are some potentially major spoilers ahead.

So, let’s just recap where things were left with all the direwolves on Thrones …Oh, THAT’S RIGHT – aside from Ghost THEY’RE ALL DEAD. View this image ›\nCrystal Ro / BuzzFeed / HBO ID: 10577699 4. Well, maybe not ALL dead – lookin’ at you, Nymeria. View this image ›\nCrystal Ro / BuzzFeed / HBO ID: 10578187 5. Because, according to Watchers on the Wall , Maisie Williams has been spotted in and around Calgary, Canada recently. And fans there have even said she was in town for “filming.” View this image ›\nCrystal Ro / BuzzFeed / Maisie Williams / Via instagram.com ID: 10577749 6. Whatever, right? WRONG. Because, Calgary is also where Instinct Animals for Film is based – the group that provides the trained wolves for green screen filming on Thrones . View this image ›\nSpin VFX / Via youtube.com One of their wolves, Quigley, has been playing Jon Snow’s lovely all-white direwolf Ghost since 2015 .\nID: 10577758 7. And they also just posted a photo of a wolf who is CLEARLY not Ghost with a very interesting “ready to work” caption and Thrones hashtag. View this image ›\n@instinctwolves / Via watchersonthewall.com According to Watchers on the Wall , this photo was posted around the same time Maisie showed up in Calgary, so…….\nID: 10577761 8.

For a refresher, the last time we saw Nymeria, Arya had to FORCE the direwolf to run away because she was afraid Joffrey would have her killed for attacking him (fuck you, Joffrey) – and also, sorry, Lady. And fans have been wondering ALL THESE SEASONS since what happened to Nymeria?!?! Because, let’s be real, there’s a VERY good chance she’s still alive.\nID: 10578003 10. SO DOES THIS MEAN ARYA AND NYMERIA WILL REUNITE IN SEASON 7?!?!?! View this image ›\nCrystal Ro / BuzzFeed / HBO Because, if so, then we’re going to be ugly crying for about a week straight. Also – if it turns out this is just ~some other~ direwolf, that’s cool, too. Here for as many direwolves as possible.\nID: 10577775 11.
