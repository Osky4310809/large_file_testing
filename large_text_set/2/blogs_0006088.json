After Taco Bell horrified us with this jalapeno-flavored Cheetos Quasaedalia monstrosity, KFC’s “Chizza” takes the experimentalism even further.\nA portmanteau of the words “chicken” and “pizza” (how long did it take to think that one up, guys?) the avant-garde dish is described by The Colonel as, “the ultimate mash-up of chicken and pizza.” In theory, such a carb-free, high-protein alternative actually makes sense, but to look at the finished product is actually kind of depressing. Really, it’s just a deep fried chicken breast with a bunch of incongruous pizza toppings bashed on top.\nWatch how #KFCChizza , the #UltimateMashup of Chicken and Pizza is made! pic.twitter.com/Jw9ZBmruVI \n— KFC_SG (@KFC_SG) February 8, 2017 \n\nPizza sauce, chicken ham (yes, chicken ham), pineapple chunks and mozzarella cheese sauce is curdled together for something that resembles some kind of space fetus.

If, for some bizarre reason, the above has whet your appetite, then check the Chizza out at most KFC Philippines locations now.\nIn other food and drinks news, have you heard of the magic Coca-Cola that’s actively good for you?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:06:56.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
