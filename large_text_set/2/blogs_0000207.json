But one of the highlights of the day was Varun Dhawan, who walked as the showstopper for close friend, menswear designer, Kunal Rawal. Aside from looking dapper in his all-white ensemble, Varun brought out a surprise element during his finale walk. While walking down the ramp with Kunal, the duo brought actor Arjun Kapoor with them, who had been sitting in the audience. Arjun, Kunal, and Varun go far back, and the camaraderie between them was clearly visible on the ramp. Because, on reaching the end of their walk, Arjun and Varun picked Kunal up and posed for pictures, with the biggest smiles on their faces. It was one of the best moments, and added a super fun element to all the ramp action. Take a look at the pictures of the trio, here.
