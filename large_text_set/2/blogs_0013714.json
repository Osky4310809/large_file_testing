King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 4 hours ago 6 \nAnthrax bassist Frank Bello said musicians should stay as far away from politics as possible, telling Rock Hard Magazine : \n\"Here's my opinion: I think musicians should play music. I think politics should take care of itself, and it will, believe me. \n\"In America, you see what's going on. It'll take care of itself. I believe everything will work out - eventually, somehow, some way. 'Cause you have to have faith. You have to have it, 'cause human nature, 'cause all of us will take over, and it will all take care of itself. \"Actors - just act; musicians - just play. \n\"Look, you do what you wanna do. What I do is I play music. It's not my game. I just watch what happens. I pray for the best, and I think human nature will take its course, and it'll all work out.\" \nThe musician added: \"It's a crazy time in our life. It's like one big reality show. And I laugh a lot. Because there's nothing we can do. What can you do about it? What can you do about it right now? You have your vote. The voting went different ways, right? \n\"I just have to believe that, at the end of the day, everyone will be positive and hopefully things will work out with level heads. All you want is level heads. I just hope things work out. I wanna be positive, and people will have smart minds and level heads. That's what matters.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:41:41.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
