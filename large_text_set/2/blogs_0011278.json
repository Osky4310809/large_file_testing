And a new trailer gives us a look at the Power Rangers film from how they got their powers to how the team came together to fight aliens. And of course the trailer gives us all of the nostalgic 90s kid feels.\nLionsgate So first up, we find out these five teens didn’t know each other previously but since they discovered an alien spaceship with some creepy rocks…naturally, now they all have special powers. Which, is honestly like the dream when you’re a teenager, isn’t it?\nLionsgate We also get a really good shot of Rita Repulsa, played by Elizabeth Banks, in the latest trailer. She looks pretty epic! Lionsgate \nCheck out the new trailer here: Wow. We’re getting really psyched for this film. Lionsgate released the full synopsis, which is pretty vague but does give an idea of what the Power Rangers will face in the film:\n“Follows five ordinary teens who must become something extraordinary when they learn that their small town of Angel Grove — and the world — is on the verge of being obliterated by an alien threat. Chosen by destiny, our heroes quickly discover they are the only ones who can save the planet. But to do so, they will have to overcome their real-life issues and before it’s too late, band together as the Power Rangers.” Aliens, action, and superheroes — what more could you ask for? Plus, judging from the trailer, there will be a few comedic moments in the film as well. Go, go, Power Rangers! We’ll be able to see more when Power Rangers hits theaters on March 24th. Until then, just keep practicing your ~mighty morphin’~ skills.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:45:14.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
