Feb 6, 2017 6:12 PM \nHe sure did Feb 6, 2017 6:13 PM \nI hate the Patriots, but LOVE this!! Feb 6, 2017 6:14 PM \nMad because they were caught cheating. sportswart says: Feb 6, 2017 6:14 PM \nI’m sure Rog is looking for a way embezzle a million out of the Pats and steal a few draft picks… Feb 6, 2017 6:14 PM \nA real salt of the earth move IMO Feb 6, 2017 6:14 PM \nmad about being caught cheating. mogogo1 says: Feb 6, 2017 6:15 PM \nJerry West is the NBA logo. This should be the new NFL logo. seatownballers says: Feb 6, 2017 6:18 PM \nUmmmm Where can I get one? \n.. \nCheating talk should simmer some fellas. There was no scandal this year. And for all the whining and trash talk, none of it counts. The Patriots fans are still drunk and yelling. They can’t hear you Feb 6, 2017 6:18 PM \nMatt is Wicked Smaaht! Feb 6, 2017 6:19 PM \n“mad about being caught cheating.” \nI have to ask you since you’re a science denier. \nWhen you get on a flight do you worry whether or not the engine elves have enough magic pixie dust to get the plane to its destination without crashing? \nDo you look under the hood of your car to make sure the squirrels on the treadmills have enough food and water to keep your car running to its next destination? \nOr when that low tire pressure indicator comes on do you rush back to view the magic video security camera thingie and see if it was Tom Brady or someone else who let the air out of your tires? \nLolz I crack myself up sometimes, I tell ya. Feb 6, 2017 6:20 PM \nJust ordered one. Going to wear it to the combine. idiedpretty says: Feb 6, 2017 6:21 PM \nTime for everyone to move on. Deflategate was handled abominably by both the NFL, Pats and Brady but in the end, it was the Pats standing tall with middle finger raised high. They won, in epic style, and Goodell couldn’t stop them. Stay classy people. The revenge is all yours! Feb 6, 2017 6:23 PM \nShould have worn it at the game!!! elmerbrownelmerbrown says: Feb 6, 2017 6:23 PM \nMatt Patricia is so fat weepingjebus says: Feb 6, 2017 6:23 PM \nThat is an insult to clowns. bigdaddy44 says: Feb 6, 2017 6:23 PM \nIf the shirt fits……….. Nofoolnodrool says: Feb 6, 2017 6:23 PM \nThe clown was wearing the shirt….what a putz. Something a child would do but hey it’s a Cheaties coach….yawn. This is what fuels the contempt ladies of chowda land. kingjoe1 says: Feb 6, 2017 6:26 PM \nMP is childish, just childish. I thought NE was professional in their approach to everything. \nWhile B&B should get credit as the best duo ever by far, they are terrible examples for kids as how to win with class. factpurveyor says: Feb 6, 2017 6:29 PM \nRoger Goodell can still make up for the mistake that the NFL made when they blamed the Patriots for what the weather does to footballs when they get cold and wet. \nJust give the Patriots the first and second picks in the 1st round of the 2017 NFL Draft and give the Patriots back their 2017 4th round pick.
