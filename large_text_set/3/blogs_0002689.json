It also released photos of the swearing-in of former President Barack Obama four and eight years ago.\nAnd it's pretty clear that the crowd size at the 45th president's inaugural was smaller than that of former President Obama.\nThe discrepancy is clear in the two photos displayed here, which show the National Mall shortly before Obama and then Trump were sworn-in around noon eights years apart. The 2009 and 2017 photos were taken one hour -- and eight years -- apart, with Obama's crowds massing in the photo about one hour earlier than Trump's audience.\nA Park Service official said that four of the photos were forwarded to the White House after Trump made an unusual call to acting Park Service director Michael Reynolds on the day after the inauguration asking him to produce the images taken by agency photographers, the Post reported in late January. The president believed the photos might prove the media lied in its reporting.\nThey are contained in \"Batch 4″ of the \"NAMA 2017″ photos of the crowd released Monday through a Freedom of Information Act request by The Washington Post and other media. The Interior Department sent an additional batch of photos to the White House.\nOn his first morning as president, Trump sought Park Service proof of crowd claim Karen Tumulty, Juliet Eilperin On the morning after Donald Trump 's inauguration, acting National Park Service director Michael Reynolds received an extraordinary summons: The new president wanted to talk to him.\nIn a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day's...\nOn the morning after Donald Trump 's inauguration, acting National Park Service director Michael Reynolds received an extraordinary summons: The new president wanted to talk to him.\nIn a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day's...\n(Karen Tumulty, Juliet Eilperin) The photos are the official record of the federal government and contradict Trump's claim that more than 1.5 million supporters crowded onto the National Mall to watch the president take the oath of office. Photos taken by news outlets during the inauguration also showed a crowd size smaller than Obama's during his first inauguration in 2009.\nThe Washington Post and other news outlets sought the official images after Trump boasted of his inauguration crowd size and his press secretary, Sean Spicer , accused the media of doctoring photographs to show angles with small numbers of attendees. Spicer also called Trump's inauguration \"the most viewed in history.\"\nInterior Department banned from Twitter after retweet of Trump inauguration crowd Lisa Rein The Interior Department was ordered Friday to shut down its official Twitter accounts -- indefinitely -- after a National Park Service employee shared two tweets that noted President Donald Trump 's relatively small inaugural crowds compared to the numbers former president Barack Obama drew in 2009.\n... The Interior Department was ordered Friday to shut down its official Twitter accounts -- indefinitely -- after a National Park Service employee shared two tweets that noted President Donald Trump 's relatively small inaugural crowds compared to the numbers former president Barack Obama drew in 2009.\n... (Lisa Rein) The official images - which show attendees up close, Park Service police monitoring crowds, protesters on the ground as well as aerial photographs shot from government helicopters - show the crowd in attendance is sparser than the president said, and certainly thinner than the numbers Obama drew in 2009.\n\"I'm assuming they show exactly what the rest of the world knows,\" said Keith Still, a mathematician and crowd expert at Manchester Metropolitan University in England who analyzed the news footage from the Trump inauguration. Still had not seen the Park Service images released Monday.\n\"It was a very large crowd,\" Still said. \"It was also a third of the Obama crowd in 2009.\" That estimate is shared by other crowd experts.\nCrowd numbers are never exact, but the Trump record could not easily be set straight because the Park Service stopped releasing official tallies after the Million Man March in 1995. The agency estimated that 400,000 people came to the gathering of black men, but organizers claimed the number was one million, and the controversy took park officials out of the crowd estimating business.\n\"What this does is validate the other photos that were out there in January,\" said Dan Gross, who was in charge of crowd logistics for Obama's 2013 inauguration. \"It's obvious they didn't have the crowd they were expecting. It's not rocket science.\"\nThe Washington Post's Karly Domb Sadof contributed to this report.\n Donald Trump Barack Obama Donald Trump Inauguration Freedom of Information Act Sean Spicer", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-588306c8/turbine/ct-interior-department-banned-from-twitter-20170120-thumbnail", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-588a9d8c/turbine/ct-trump-park-service-crowd-size-20170126-thumbnail", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58be5290/turbine/ct-inauguration-crowd-photos-obama-trump-20170306"], "published": "2017-03-07T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T18:22:26.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
