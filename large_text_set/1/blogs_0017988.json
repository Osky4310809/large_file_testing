President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,” the plan says.

Our job is to make life more comfortable for parents who want their kids to be able to walk the streets safely. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school,” the Trump White House page says. \n“Supporting law enforcement means supporting our citizens’ ability to protect themselves. We will uphold Americans’ Second Amendment rights at every level of our judicial system,” the page says. \nThe section titled “Making Our Military Strong Again” not only pledges to boost cybersecurity, but also to protect the American mainland. \n“We will also develop a state-of-the-art missile defense system to protect against missile-based attacks from states like Iran and North Korea,” it says. \nIn the section on foreign policy, the page sounds an aggressive tone of military expansion. \n”… we will rebuild the American military . Our Navy has shrunk from more than 500 ships in 1991 to 275 in 2016. Our Air Force is roughly one third smaller than in 1991. President Trump is committed to reversing this trend, because he knows that our military dominance must be unquestioned,” the page reads. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
