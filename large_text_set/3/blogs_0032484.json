You're being groomed too. \nIn order to have access to a child, a predator needs to go through their care-givers - and in such a way that they don't arouse suspicion. It's not always easy to know what to watch out for \nWhat this means is they will need to build a relationship of trust with you, the parent. \n\"Grooming usually involves a perpetrator establishing a trusting relationship with a child and those associated with the child's care and wellbeing, to create an environment in which abuse can occur, \" the report reads. \nIt's also important to note that the perpetrator most likely won't exhibit behaviours which correspond to what you think are characteristic of a predator. \n\"The motivation behind the behaviour â€“ to perpetrate or conceal child sexual abuse,\" the report continues, \"was not outwardly visible and it was therefore difficult to recognise the behaviour as grooming.\" 2. They're disguised as a friend. \nIt's because of the above - the trust building - that identifying when someone means your child harm is so difficult. There's a chance an abuser might be part of your social circle (Photo: Getty Images) \nThe abuser has established a position in your lives and, as such, \"any interaction between the perpetrator and child is seen as legitimate activity, distinguishable only by the perpetrator's motivation to perpetrate or conceal child sexual abuse. \n\"In this way, grooming is sometimes only discernible after the abuse has been identified because the perpetrator's intent or motivation is not immediately visible.\" 3. Watch out for presents and \"special events\" \nNearly every child loves receiving gifts and most adults know it's often an easy way of endearing yourself to them. \nWhile it's perfectly natural to buy gifts for a child you care about, it is also a foil which predator use to get close to their victims while in a role which allows them access to a child. A predator's method will involve isolating a child \n\"An example may include a perpetrator targeting children using age-appropriate games or toys,\" the report explains. \nA further indicator is if an adult seems to take \"an interest in child play and toys that appear to exceed his or her care-giving role.\" \nThis is \"institutional grooming\" and the perpetrator will use \"features unique to the organisational setting to sexually abuse a child\". \nThese may include opportunity, anonymity, secrecy, trust and power. 4. There are three stages to grooming. \nThe process an abuser puts into action may culminate tragically, but its beginnings are seemingly harmless - such as giving a gift. Abuse often beings innocuously, with a gesture like giving a gift \nHowever, the process will escalate over time. \nThe stages which an abuser will put their victim through are as follows: \n1. Gaining access to a victim2. Initiating and maintaining abuse3. Concealing abuse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T17:03:29.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
