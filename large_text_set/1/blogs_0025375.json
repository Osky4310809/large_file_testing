Triple Chocolate Cheesecake flavored protein powder . . . ” Jules Miller says, nearly audibly scrunching her nose over the phone. Miller, founder of the Nue Co., a new line of elegantly packaged organic wellness powders launching on Net-a-Porter today, is on a mission to redefine the oft-overlooked category. “We really wanted to change the way people felt about supplements,” she explains. Expand The Nue Co. founder Jules Miller Photo: Courtesy of The Nue Co. Miller’s own health journey began when she was diagnosed with IBS while working as the head of business development for The Detox Kitchen (London’s answer to Sakara Life). “It was funny because I was immersed in the wellness industry, and I was taking everything and anything that I was told would help, [but] I had no relationship with these supplements,” Miller says. It wasn’t until her grandfather, a 92-year-old chemist who helped create the B12 vitamin supplement, suggested that she read the label and do some of her own research that she realized just how uninformed she was. “In general, people don’t know why they’re taking [supplements]. They just think they should be taking them,” she explains.\nInspired by her grandfather, whose philosophy is that the body can get everything it needs through food, Miller set out to create supplements that are as close to their natural form as possible, harnessing ingredients from across the globe like baobab, beet root, and goji berry. What resulted are two protein powders, Milk (a quick recovery boost best suited for post-workout or in between meetings) and Plant (a slow-releasing formula that possesses the same amount of protein as two eggs), as well as a line of prebiotic-rich boosters. That three-piece set—Skin Food, Energy Food, and Debloat Food—complements the proteins in the morning, or can be consumed as needed throughout the day. \nBut for all of Miller’s emphasis on ingredients, aesthetics are of paramount importance, as well. Based on pared-back Danish design principles, the Nue Co.’s Rebuild line comes in display-worthy amber-hued glass bottles. “We’re focusing on getting people in touch with their supplements and influencing their beauty regimen,” she says. “We hope that people love it just as much as their skin care.” And now that taking wellness supplements seems as mandatory as, say, applying a dollop of La Mer’s Crème de la Mer in the morning or indulging in an SK-II sheet mask every weekend, how could we not?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:41:41.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
