She named the BBC, The Times, The Independent, and The Sunday Times among the media which lashed out at Sputnik this time. \nThe media mentioned 124 episodes of Sputnik publishing allegedly \"distorted reality\" news items, Zakharova said. \"It was another blow against Russian media in Britain. That country ceases to be media-friendly. Foreign media face all the more problems working in Britain, it is obvious,\" she added. It is also obvious that the UK applies an ideological approach to media, Zakharova said. \nZakharova mentioned that such trends as \"Russian hackers\", and now \"fake news\" from Russia are on purpose launched to be followed by mainstream media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T11:50:21.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
