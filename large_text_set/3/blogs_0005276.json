According to Matt Law, Jason Burt and Jeremy Wilson in the Telegraph , despite the Gunners previously being hopeful Ozil would sign a new deal—his current contract expires in 2018—the playmaker has \" not responded\" to a recent £200,000-a-week offer, and \"f riends in Germany [claim] he wants to quit the Emirates.\" Meanwhile, manager Arsene Wenger is reportedly becoming more open to the idea that both Sanchez and Ozil need to be sold in the summer, and Oxlade-Chamberlain \" looks certain to quit the club,\" as he wants more regular first-team action and also has a contract that expires in 2018, per Law, Burt and Wilson. BBC News' Helen Miller provided the Telegraph 's splash: Helen Miller @MsHelicat 3/8/2017, 10:11:27 PM Sanchez's departure has seemed inevitable for some time now. He was dropped to the bench for Arsenal's last Premier League outing against Liverpool after a training-ground bust-up, and Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly at the head of the queue to sign him, with Juventus also interested, per Law and Wilson . According to Sami Mokbel in the Daily Mail , Sanchez, Ozil and Oxlade-Chamberlain may not be the only summer departures, as Jack Wilshere—currently on loan at Bournemouth —Lucas Perez and David Ospina could also be headed for the exit door. Whatever happens, it seems inevitable that the summer of 2017 will be a period of major upheaval at the Emirates. Calls for Wenger to leave the club when his current deal expires at the end of the season have increased further following Arsenal's humiliating UEFA Champions League exit to Bayern Munich on Tuesday, per Vicki Hodges in the Telegraph . A photo posted by Bleacher Report UK (@bleacherreportuk) Ozil said back in January that his future at Arsenal depended on whether Wenger would remain at the club past the summer, per German outlet Kicker (via the Guardian 's Marcus Christenson ). The atmosphere around Arsenal has soured significantly since then, though, not least because of the Gunners' abject performances in the Champions League, but they have also dropped a number of points in the Premier League and currently sit outside the top four. Ozil, 28, has been absent from the side recently through illness, but there have reportedly been suggestions it was not solely his health issues that kept him out the team, per Law, Burt and Wilson. If even Wenger is willing to let the Germany international go, it seems likely Ozil will leave in the summer whether the French manager remains at Arsenal or not.
