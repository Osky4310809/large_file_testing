Could   \nVincent Kompany body might be battered, bruised and covered in “1001 scars” but he won't let his spirit be broken. \nCaptain Kompany opened up about the injury misery that has blighted his career after helping City ease into round five at Crystal Palace on his latest comeback. \nThere was a simple child-like happiness just to be back out on the pitch for the first time since November and complete only his second 90 minutes this season. \nThere was a candid admission that he is his own worst enemy and many of the war wounds he has suffered are his fault. \nBut the biggest point City's influential skipper wanted to make is that he will never stop fighting back from injury, no matter how many times his body breaks down.

For me if something brings me bad luck I’ll go looking for it again to see if it'll be bad luck again. That’s how I am. \n\"I am the happiest player in the world today. I'm like a child growing up with the dream to play football. Kompany and Guardiola embrace at the end of the game (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \n“I want to play but at the same time I’m a fighter. I will not give up – it’s impossible for me. I’ve always been confident I can come back and do a job. \n“I’ve had [injuries] since I was 14 years old but still built this career that I’ve built. I won’t stop and I know I'll keep fighting even if it's for [just] one game, so I can experience these moments. \n“The moment I give up on that, I can guarantee one thing: that I will never set foot on a football pitch again. \n“If I felt that in training these guys were a little too much for me I’d hold my hand up and say. But at the moment I’m with the best in training so there’s no reason to stop. \n“Not sometimes, [but] every time they have to tell me to keep calm and not rush my rehab. That's one of the reasons why I get injured that often. \n“I have 1001 scars and most of the time they are my own fault. But that's who I am. And I don't want to change.” City were too good for Palace (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Read More Pep Guardiola hails Gabriel Jesus \"the future of Man City\" \nKomany slotted seamlessly back into City's defence at Selhurst Park. \nAnd as he did so it was impossible not to wonder how much better City's season, defence and John Stones' development would have been had he been able to stay fit. \nAt the other end City's future looks bright and exciting on the basis of this routine fourth round win as their young front trio all shone. \nRaheem Sterling converted new boy Gabriel Jesus's pass for 1-0 before Leroy Sane scored the second.
