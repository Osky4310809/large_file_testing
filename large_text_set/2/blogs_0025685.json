A 16-day break from action and a training trip to La Manga seemingly did little for Liverpool's competitive edge as they fell well short of the swashbuckling brilliance that took down Tottenham last time out. \nLike Leicester, they have only one Premier League win this calendar year and are in fifth having played a game more than Manchester City and Arsenal in third and fourth, while sixth-placed Manchester United are a point behind with a game in hand. \nShinji Okazaki replaced Ahmed Musa in a Leicester starting XI that reverted predominantly to the shape and personnel that brought them glory last season and the Japan international was to the fore in a positive start from the hosts - Simon Mignolet keeping out a clever seventh-minute header. \nThe sight of Liverpool's defence retreating under a high ball forward from Kasper Schmeichel and being put under further pressure by a fine Vardy touch provided another flashback to Leicester's title heroics. \nAs has often been the case this time around, the England striker's finish was lacking, though he made amends in the 28th minute when Drinkwater slid a pass through a generously positioned Liverpool backline. \nVardy 's darting run was followed by assured touches and a drilled low finish that left Mignolet with no chance and ended a league drought for the striker dating back to December 10. \nSchmeichel was out quickly to prevent Coutinho registering a swift equaliser but Liverpool's lethargy remained and, after Vardy's backheel found Wilfried Ndidi to draw another stop from Mignolet, Leicester spectacularly doubled their lead. \nJames Milner's headed clearance sat up nicely for Drinkwater to sweetly smash into the bottom-right corner from 25 yards.
