To commemorate their move, the Chargers unveiled a logo which was immediately trashed pretty much unanimously by the whole internet . But the Tampa Bay Lightning, who couldn’t help but notice similarities to both their logo and that of the Los Angeles Dodgers, opened up their own can of worms with this tweet:\n*checks mentions*\n*squints*\n*clears throat*\nfor the record, us & the @dodgers are just friends https://t.co/jBoJhZlYVD \n— Tampa Bay Lightning (@TBLightning) January 12, 2017 \n\nThat is A-plus corporate tweeting right there, and it precipitated this kinda-weird, kinda-great interaction:\n@TBLightning you said you'd call.\n— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) January 12, 2017 \n@Dodgers oh, honey.\n— Tampa Bay Lightning (@TBLightning) January 12, 2017 \n\n\nBut it didn’t stop there with official team accounts. Some other teams, most notably the Dallas Stars and a bucketload of minor league baseball teams, decided to try their hand at Chargers-style branding.\nnew logo. hope this is cool, @dallascowboys pic.twitter.com/cCBPHjqWxP \n— Dallas Stars (@DallasStars) January 12, 2017 \nAre we doing this right? pic.twitter.com/OwDBuCdyDH \n— #PonyUpTempo (@SMU_Football) January 12, 2017 \nWe're not ones to fall behind the times. pic.twitter.com/IUuKvO2KUk \n— Montgomery Biscuits (@BiscuitBaseball) January 12, 2017 \n\n\n. @RAIDERS If you're looking for a new logo idea when you move to Vegas… pic.twitter.com/KIiFKwTizR \n— IronPigs (@IronPigs) January 12, 2017 \nJoin us for Welcome Back @Chargers Night on Friday, August 18th! #Chargers #ChargersToLA pic.twitter.com/VbLoNJXJmy \n— Inland Empire 66ers (@66ersBaseball) January 12, 2017 \n. @TBLightning @Dodgers samesies. pic.twitter.com/ydAkSfa8xG \n— Omaha Storm Chasers (@OMAStormChasers) January 12, 2017 \n\n\nUhh, yeah.

One team that seems to have completely missed the point of this little game is the Florida Panthers, who made a meme about… having games to play?\nWhen everyone's tweeting about a logo change but you've got back-to-back games to prep for. ☕️ pic.twitter.com/yOjX0nde0r \n— Florida Panthers (@FlaPanthers) January 12, 2017 \n\nDoes a Panthers player or coach run the account? Is that why they’re claiming to be so busy? Isn’t making a meme to make fun of others making memes the equivalent of reading an entire article on a sports blog only to comment, “Slow news day, huh?”\nThe capper to this story makes it even better. Now the Chargers are telling everyone that the logo everyone’s trashing isn’t their real logo:\nThe @Chargers told me this is NOT their new logo- you won't see it on helmets or uniforms… it was for marketing purposes today. pic.twitter.com/xZaucUmYgT \n— Liz Habib (@LizHabib) January 12, 2017 \n\nTo which we all say, “Yeah, sure.”\nLove this move.
