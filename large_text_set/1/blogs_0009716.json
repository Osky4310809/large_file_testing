He said that the plant had been limited to less than 400 megawatts due to shortage of gas. \nMeanwhile, the Minister of Power Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, during the 11th Monthly Stakeholders meeting in Lagos on Jan. 9, unveiled plans to inaugurate some electricity projects this year. \nFashola said that some of the projects to be inaugurated in the course of the year include the completion of the Kaduna 215 megawatt power plant, the Gurara project and the Gardin Kowa plant. \nOthers are switching of the Gudenda substation, as well as the conclusion of the Katsina wind and the Abuja solar farms. \nThe second phase of the Abuja solar project, he said would run-up from 800 megawatts to 1.2 megawatts and raised the hope of possibility of partnerships in the area of development of hydro dams. \nHe also disclosed that there were 14 projects for transmission in Lagos State and Ikeja West, the largest in terms of transformer capacity, was undergoing expansion to respond to the growing needs of population. \n“This tells you clearly that the transmission system is not static, it is dynamic and expanding.” \nAccording to the minister, the evacuation of power at the Ikot Ekpene switching station is what has kept the grid to almost 4,000 megawatts. \n“We still have 3,000 megawatt out from the damage of the Escravos and Forcados, so if that comes back, we are almost at 7,000 megawatts, so the target is incremental power.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T19:05:18.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
