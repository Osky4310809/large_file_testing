It looks like it's a possibility, according to recent spy shots of a suspicious test mule. But it could also be a Durango powered up with the FCA US 6.4-liter V8 that makes 475 hp.\n\nSpy shooters report that the mule captured here sounds like the Hellcat-powered Dodge Chargers and Challengers. Hidden design cues like the fascia suggest this Durango has truly devilish power. There's also a bulging hood with an air intake under the camouflage.\n\nSo it could be a Durango Hellcat. It's also possible Dodge is dropping the 6.4-liter V8 used in the Grand Cherokee SRT under the hood of the Durango. Engine sharing makes sense, since both FCA SUVs are based on the same platform and built at the same factory in Michigan, though the Durango is longer to accommodate a third row.\n\nIt is also more logical Dodge would add the 475-hp mill to the Durango's lineup first before going all the way to the 6.2-liter 707-hp Hellcat engine. The most powerful current Durango has a 360-hp 5.7-liter Hemi V8. We expect the Durango will get a refresh for 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T19:45:47.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
