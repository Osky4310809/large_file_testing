Soulja commented with heart emojis on one of Tran’s Instagram photos , which ignited the feud in the first place. \nTo make matters more complicated, now the woman at the center of the entire controversy is chiming in via Instagram as well. “This isn’t cool or funny,” Tran wrote in response to one of Brown’s comments. “It’s draining not just for me but for everyone. There’s so much more out there in life then ‘Twitter beefs.’ But anyways.. second off.. trying. to. make. me. feel. poppin? You talking about your old song ‘Poppin’? You know what makes me feel poppin? Getting up and going to set.. walking in my apartment and seeing my Emmy with my name on it.. giving away shoes and feeding the less fortunate.. being able to provide for my family with my own $$.. that’s what makes me feel good about myself.” A photo posted by Baller Alert (@balleralert) on Jan 3, 2017 at 9:07am PST \nSpoken like the true gentleman he apparently isn’t, Brown fired back, saying he wasn’t looking for the Emmy Award-winning actress and model’s opinion on the situation. He says that she wouldn’t even be relevant if he hadn’t put her name in headlines after claiming he wanted her back last month.
