Messi is a player who can make the difference and Martin can do the same, but any comparisons should not be taken seriously,\" Fjortoft told Goal . \n\"He should be able to develop gradually and one step at a time. He has already shown that he is ready to take on new challenges.\"Martin does not feel any extra pressure. Let's compare his situation to that of established stars like Bastian Schweinsteiger, Philipp Lahm and Toni Kroos. They were all cheered by the media at some stage and they are role models now. \"The footballer of the future does not only need talent, but he should also work hard, be disciplined and put in more effort than others. You have to follow your goals and stay professional.\" \nHeerenveen are currently fourth in the Eredivisie table at the mid-season break, sitting 13 points behind leaders Feyenoord as they chase European qualification.
