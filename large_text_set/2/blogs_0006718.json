Facebook/PNP, released MANILA, Philippines — Philippine National Police (PNP) spokesperson Senior Superintendent Dionardo Carlos said on Tuesday that reassigning officers to other areas is not a form of punishment. \"Hindi po ito parusa. It's an ongoing activity or program in the Philippine National Police,\" Carlos said in a press briefing on Tuesday at the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame. He added that as active members of the police force, it is a \"regular thing\" for officers to be transferred or reassigned. His statement came after President Rodrigo Duterte announced early Wednesday that he will send rogue police officers to Sulu, Basilan, Tawi-Tawi and other areas in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to fight terrorist groups such as the Abu Sayyaf group and the Maute group. \"Kayo lahat ngayon nandito, kasali kayo sa Task Force South. Padala ko kayo sa Basilan. Tumira kayo doon ng mga dalawang taon,\" he said to about 200 officers who were assembled in Malacañang. READ: Go to Basilan or resign, Rody tells erring cops The decision to transfer rogue police officers to Mindanao came after seven officers from Pampanga were accused in robbery-extortion of three Korean nationals, as well as the killing of Korean businessman Jee Ick-Joo inside the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame. Director General Ronald dela Rosa meanwhile asked people in Mindanao last February 1 to kill rogue cops if they continue to misbehave. \"That is why I sent them there, so they can die if they commit some foolishness,\" Dela Rosa said in an interview at the Angeles City police station in Pampanga. READ: PNP chief to ARMM folk: Kill rogue cops It is the answer of the PNP chief to ARMM residents and officials when they raised their concerns for having abusive policemen transferred to their region. While some policemen questioned being included in the list of officers who committed minor offenses, Carlos said that any cop with administrative case will be included. \"Kaya nga po pinarereview yung mga individual na cases na mga ito so we can look at sino nga ba yung mga habitual recidivist, at sino yung nagkamali lang ho at siya naman ho ay nais tumayo, nais mag bago,\" Carlos said. He added that police officers have to follow a process before they can pass on a verdict. He also asked for understanding from the public. \"Hindi ho natatapos dun sa berating o front leaning rest na ginagawa sa mga nagkakamaling pulis. Tumutuloy po yung mga kasong ito,\" Carlos said. He also said that they are looking at the needs for services of a community for transferring police officers. \"Right now, there is a need for them to be in Task Force South and the order of the commander-in-chief is to be there,\" Carlos said. Carlos added that they will file a case against erring cops who failed to attend the meeting with the president on Tuesday if they continue to be absent without prior notice for 11 days. He also warned of dropping them from the police force if they continue to disobey this order for 30 days. \"Kukunin po namin sa NCRPO (National Capital Region Police Office) kung sino po 'yung dapat na sila ay nag-report kahapon. We will make them answer for why they did not appear or reported to duty,\" Carlos said.
