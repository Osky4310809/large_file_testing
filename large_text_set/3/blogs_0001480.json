Fortunately for both sides, it won’t come to that. \nThe Chiefs signed Berry to a six-year, $78 million extension with $40 million guaranteed. The deal makes him the highest-paid safety in the NFL at $13 million per year, edging Arizona’s Tyrann Mathieu, who makes $12.5 million per year. It’s official. We have signed safety Eric Berry to a contract extension. https://t.co/ak9M7wa9VW pic.twitter.com/kaIiNl3Yvx \n— Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) February 28, 2017 \nBerry put together arguably his best season as a pro in 2016. He racked up 77 tackles with a career-high four interceptions and one forced fumble. The biggest change he made to his game was showing that he could not only thrive as a strong safety but cover in the deep middle of the field as a free safety. \nHis versatility was a huge reason the Chiefs’ defense was as good as it was this season, and he single-handedly won a game against the Falcons with a pick-six and a game-winning pick-two on Atlanta’s two-point conversion attempt. \nBerry was the NFL’s Comeback Player of the Year following the 2015 season after beating cancer the year before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:30:25.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
