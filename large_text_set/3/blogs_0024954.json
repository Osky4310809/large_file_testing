(Pagcor) chair Andrea Domingo telling a gathering of investors yesterday not to believe a negative report relayed by the country’s second highest official to a UN body. \nAddressing delegates to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations gaming summit at the Conrad Hotel in Pasay City, Domingo warned that Robredo would do “anything” to become president. \nDomingo was referring to Robredo’s relaying a videotaped message last week to the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Geneva, criticizing extrajudicial killings and human rights violations in the course of the Duterte administration’s war on drugs. \nThe Pagcor chief asked the delegates to ignore Robredo’s tirades unless they start seeing for themselves dead bodies in the streets or people getting killed.
