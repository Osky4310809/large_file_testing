Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse agree multi-billion-dollar settlements with US Read more \nThe fines are the latest development in a string of legal woes for the German banking giant, coming less than two weeks after the bank finalised a $7.2bn settlement with the Department of Justice over its role in the 2008 global financial crisis. \nThe New York authorities said in a statement they were joined by Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority in penalising the bank after finding pervasive weaknesses in Deutsche Bank’s internal safeguards for money laundering and client risk. \nDFS Superintendent Maria Vullo said in the statement: “This Russian mirror-trading scheme occurred while the bank was on clear notice of serious and widespread compliance issues dating back a decade.” \nThe department fined the bank $425m, while FCA’s fine was £163m, or about $204m. \nBank units tasked with legal compliance and preventing money laundering were understaffed and ineffective, the DFS said. \nIn “mirror” trades, clients would purchase stocks in roubles in Moscow while other clients who were related or even had the same owner would sell the same stock at the same price through the bank’s London branch. \n“By converting roubles into dollars through security trades that had no discernible economic purpose, the scheme was a means for bad actors within a financial institution to achieve improper ends while evading compliance with applicable laws,” according to the legal document detailing the settlement with DFS. \nIn addition to paying the fines, Deutsche Bank also will be required to hire an outside monitor to review its internal compliance measures.
