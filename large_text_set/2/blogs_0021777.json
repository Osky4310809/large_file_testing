(Photo: AP) \nLast Friday, Kyrie Irving said that he believes the Earth is flat on his teammates' Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye's Road Trippin' podcast. Since then, many jokes have been made and Irving sort of backed down, while NBA commissioner Adam Silver said the Cavs guard was simply \"trying to be provocative.\" \nAlmost a week later, on Wednesday, a photo surfaced of Jefferson wearing a hilarious \"Flat World Champions\" shirt. It's said to be a screengrab from an Instagram Live video on the Road Trippin' IG account. For those wondering how the Cavs are taking Kyrie's comments about Earth being flat, here's RJ's shirt during Road Trippin's live IG video: pic.twitter.com/JqngnY86Z8 â€” Josh Poloha (@JorshP) February 22, 2017 \nThe shirt is made by Fresh Brewed Tees. â€” Fresh Brewed Tees (@FreshBrewedTees) February 19, 2017 \nJefferson has commented on Irving's strange belief. On The Jump , the Cavaliers vet said that he thinks \"it was more to open people's thoughts and people's minds,\" echoing what the league commissioner said to reporters at All-Star Weekend.
