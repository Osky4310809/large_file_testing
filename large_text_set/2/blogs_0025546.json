Martin Clunes is virtually incoherent, pathetic drivel turned it off [sic]. David Walliams was blasted for his hosting skills on ITV's The Nightly Show (Photo: Rex Features) \nAnd it seems that many others agreed with those sentiments, as ElfanAprees wrote: \"Sorry but 7 minutes of The Nightly Show and David Walliams self preening into an autocue is seven minutes of my life lost [sic].\" \n\"The wonder, surely, is that somebody thought a nightly show presented by David Walliams WOULDN'T be terrible,\" wrote @hellothisisivan. \nAnd, despite some viewers complaining of a lack of star-power on the sofa, it was the choice of David as host that truly sunk the show in the eyes of many viewers.

But David Walliams is the host. Martin Clunes is a guest. And it's on ITV. Don't think I'll bother,\" wrote @andrewpunton. \nAnother disappointed viewer exclaimed: \"The nightly show is a great idea, shame its got David Walliams hosting it!!\" \nThe show, which has been touted as the UK's answer to the USA's The Late Night Show and The Tonight Show, debuted on Monday with the Britain's Got Talent judge set to host its first week. \nHowever, the comedian will not be a permanent fixture, as the hosting duties are set to rotate weekly. \nOther stars lined-up to helm the programme include: John Bishop, Davina McCall and Gordon Ramsay. \nThe Nightly Show with David Walliams will air at 10pm on ITV this week on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
