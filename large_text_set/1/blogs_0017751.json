(Kevin Richardson/Baltimore Sun video) Peter Schmuck is on the verge of finalizing a three-year deal, the Orioles are in a position to have one of Major League Baseball 's most powerful lineups for the foreseeable future.\nTrumbo, who has agreed to terms on a three-year, $37.5 million deal pending a physical, is coming off his most productive offensive season and will be paired with two-time major league home run champ Chris Davis at least through the 2019 season. \nThe Orioles also return Adam Jones and young sluggers Manny Machado and Jonathan Schoop , while replacing power-hitting catcher Matt Wieters with free agent Welington Castillo. \nThe money saved in the catching switch and estimated $4 million saved when the Orioles traded pitcher Yovani Gallardo for outfielder Seth Smith had to made it easier to justify locking up Trumbo to what appears to be a pretty favorable deal for the club. \nTrumbo's pending return seems to clarify the outfield/designated hitter situation and might have delayed the arrival of top offensive prospect Trey Mancini, who was considered a candidate for the Opening Day roster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T04:22:14.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
