We've scored a lot of goals, given a lot of assists to each other, we've won two Champions Leagues,\" Bale said via the Daily Mail , \"So it hasn't gone too bad. \n\"He's in great shape but his role has changed. He's more of a striker now. When he was younger at Manchester United you'd see him running from deep. \n\"He's changed his game slightly. He's very effective in the box, scoring goals, making assists. As you get older, even I'm starting to change my game a little bit. He knows what he's doing and he's doing it very well.\" \nRonaldo and Bale face Napoli on Tuesday, with Madrid leading 3-1 from the first leg of the Champions League last-16 fixture. \nWhile Madrid are looking to secure their spot in the quarter-finals, it will also be a chance for Ronaldo to end his run of five games without a goal in the European competition.
