Tamblyn gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter, and announced on Instagram with a cute video that her name is Dauphinoise Petunia Brittany Scheherazade Von Funkinstein Mustard Witch RBG Cross Tamblyn-Bey Jr.\nSEE ALSO: Amber Tamblyn's unusual pregnancy announcement has a strong message\nDavid and I are proud to announce the birth of our daughter, Dauphinoise Petunia Brittany Scheherazade Von Funkinstein Mustard Witch RBG Cross Tamblyn-Bey jr. #TheFutureIsFemale\nA post shared by Amber Tamblyn (@amberrosetamblyn) on Feb 21, 2017 at 11:45am PST\nOf course, she's trolling us here, but that's fine.
