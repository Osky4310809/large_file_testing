This move comes after the February 25, 2017 passing of star Bill Paxton at 61 from complications during surgery. The show’s official Twitter page posted a tribute to Paxton that you can see below. The show, which had been airing on Thursday nights at 10 p.m., will be replaced by the new season of The Amazing Race , which will premiere on March 30. It was originally scheduled to return on Fridays beginning April 21. \nRelated: We chat with Training Day’s Katrina Law \nTraining Day had wrapped production on its first season back in December and the network has yet to announce if it will return for another. Other TV shows have survived the death of their star, including News Radio (Phil Hartman), 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter (John Ritter) and The West Wing (John Spencer). In loving memory of Bill Paxton. pic.twitter.com/YCEm7FQmDg \n— Training Day (@TrainingDayCBS) February 26, 2017 \nIn a recent interview before his death, co-star Katrina Law spoke to ComingSoon.net about working with Paxton. She said, “Bill is one of the best team leaders you could ask for. He comes to work every single day with a smile on his face, and he says, “Good morning breakfast lovers!” He just starts the day off right. He’s got a positive attitude. He’s got so much work to do, as you can tell from the three episodes that you’ve watched, all he does is talk the entire time. So he has a lot on his plate that he has to handle and he gets it done everyday, and at the end of the day, he walks away with a smile and makes sure that everybody stays in line. He’s so positive and so professional. And funny! So funny!” \nTraining Day is a crime thriller starring the late Paxton and Justin Cornwell ( Empire ) that began 15 years after the events of the feature film, about a young, idealistic police officer who is tapped to go undercover in an elite squad of the LAPD where he partners with a morally ambiguous veteran detective. Law ( Spartacus ), Drew Van Acker ( Pretty Little Liars ), Lex Scott Davis ( Toni Braxton: Unbreak My Heart ), Julie Benz ( Dexter ), Christina Vidal ( Welcome to the Dollhouse ) and Marianne Jean-Baptiste ( Without a Trace ) also star. \nHave you guys been watching the show?
