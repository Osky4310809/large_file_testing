The work of Vanda Electrics and its technical partner Williams Advanced Engineering, the Dendrobium is a two-seater electric vehicle that has a claimed top speed in excess of 322 km/h. \nAs we’ve reported previously , the Dendrobium is named after a genus of orchids native to Singapore, and its automatic roof and doors open in a synchronous manner to resemble a fully-bloomed dendrobium flower. The company says there’s some purpose to the car’s theatrics – improving access to the teardrop-shaped cockpit by making ingress and egress easier than other hypercars. \nMeanwhile, the rest of the car resembles that of an LMP race car, with highlights like an aerodynamic floor, rear diffuser, front splitter, and alloy wheels (20-inch front and 21-inch rear) wrapped with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres. \nAt the rear, the light bar, which passes for taillights, form an arch over the car’s plug-in port and charging indicator, with the exposed double wishbone rear suspension (front as well) in plain sight. To ensure the Dendrobium doesn’t exceed its 1,750 kg target weight, there’s a composite monocoque chassis, carbon-fibre body panels, and carbon ceramic brake discs with lightweight alloy calipers. \nMore carbon-fibre can be found on the inside, where you’ll find plenty of angular styling as part of the Dendrobium’s minimalistic design. To keep things interesting, the driver gets a bright red sports seat, while the passenger’s seat is black. \nRegardless, both front seats are upholstered with leather from Scotland’s Bridge of Weir Leather Company, and feature stitching and motifs inspired by muscle fibres. There’s also a digital dashboard with two smaller displays flanking it, which shows you a live video feed from the wing-mounted cameras as there are no conventional side mirrors. \nOther performance targets for the Dendrobium aside from its top speed is a 0-96 km/h (0-60 mph) time of just 2.7 seconds. No word on how the EV will accomplish this but the company says the project will “feature the latest lithium-ion battery and electric powertrain technology.” \nShould the EV progress from concept to production, Vanda says the car’s layout could feature two inboard-mounted electric motors (one for each axle), where there’s a single-speed gearbox and differential at the front, and a multi-speed gearbox and differential at the rear. The first model is expected to hit the road by 2020, depending on the response garnered during the Geneva Motor Show.
