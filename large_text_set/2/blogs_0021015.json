Just to paint a picture, we’re getting married this year and I had to ensure I picked a date that was well after grand final weekend because he’s that obsessed! \nAfter being surrounded by SuperCoaches for the past three years — not just at home but at work, I decided to give it a crack myself. I love the game of rugby league, I’ve just never thought of myself as someone who can analyse the statistics and care about it on a blow-by-blow basis — so I’m not going to bother with all of that. media_camera Daily Telegraph Social Media Editor Olivia Noakes with fiance Angus Mead, who is a video journalist at the Daily Telegraph. \nI’m going to play the game based on nostalgia, personal favourites and various other reasons why I may like a player. I’m going to try and not focus on statistics or talent. \nThis year I want to encourage all the girls out there to get involved and beat their other halves at the game they love most! I figure if I’m making my man listen to me constantly talk about wedding plans, the least I can do is invest some time in his passion. Who knows it could bring us closer together or I could whoop his behind and beat him at the game he loves so bloody much! media_camera Olivia Noakes and fiance Angus Mead media_camera Olivia Noakes is taking on her future husband Angus Mead in SuperCoach. \nMY TEAM \nCaptain and hooker is Cameron Smith: As a patriotic Queenslander I can’t go past my very own captain of the Maroons, Cameron Smith. He’s the most expensive player in the league but in my opinion the best and a guaranteed points scorer. \nFront rower’s are Sam Burgess and Sam Thaiday: I happen to think Sam Burgess has a hot accent, a hot wife whose fashion sense is always on point and now a bundle of cuteness in the form of little Poppy, hence why he gets my vote. Sam Thaiday was a bit of an idol to me during my early twenties. I worked in a men’s clothing store in Brisbane, which he frequented quite often and he was always such a stand up guy. Two thumbs up for being Mr Personality Plus Sammy! \n2nd row forwards are Jason Taumalolo, Angus Crichton and Tyson Frizell: I adore the name Taumalolo and am simply obsessed with saying it, especially when I’m reading the morning news LIVE on our Facebook page. He’s also a Dally M winner so you can’t go wrong, right? Angus Crichton shares the same Christian name as my fiance, hence why I chose him. Finally Tyson Frizell is a monster for the Dragons, who after my beloved Broncos, are my second team. Only because my future husband goes for them. Yes I know, I’m going to make an exceptional wife! media_camera Olivia Noakes is backing herself to beat fiance Angus Mead in SuperCoach. \nVice captain and halfback is Johnathan Thurston: There is no definitive reason for this choice apart from the fact he is an Immortal in my eyes. I once made my parents drive me to a nightclub near our house in Noosa just so I could meet him when he was doing a special appearance there. Suffice to say I had a wee bit of a crush on this guy back in the day. \nFive-eighth is Anthony Milford: He’s a Broncos young gun and the future of the game — this was an easy choice considering I’m a Broncos girl first and foremost. \nPREDICTED ROUND 1 TEAMS \nWings/centres are Nathan Ross, Konrad Hurrell, Siosifa Talakai and Brian Kelly: Nathan Ross went to Waverley College, which happens to be where my fiance went to school. He also nicknamed HIMSELF ‘White Lightning’. How can you not back a guy with tickets on himself like that!? Konrad Hurrell is hilarious on Instagram and as Social Media Editor for The Daily Telegraph, social is my life. Keep the cracking posts coming @koni_hurrell! Siosifa Talakai has simply been chosen because I can sniff out a bargain anywhere, and I was of course way over budget so needed a gun cheapie. Finally, Brian Kelly was chosen because I work with a Brian Kelly who is one of the most lovely human beings I ever met. Always interested in what’s going on in your life and up for a chin wag. Not sure he can play footy though, lets hope his namesake can! media_camera Olivia Noakes and Angus Mead \nFullback is Darius Boyd: Do I really need to explain why? Captain of my team the Broncos, Enough said! \nIf there’s any like-minded ladies who are still reading this story, good on you for sticking around and seriously — take up the challenge of playing against your significant other and SMASHING them at SuperCoach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:52:28.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
