A woman had jumped to safety from a second-floor window, and Farrand had rescued a man trapped on his roof by bringing over a ladder. No one reportedly was hurt in the fire that has left one home “completely gone.”\n“Most important thank you Cole Farrand for rescuing our tenants from the roof and getting them to safety!” Jill Lapham Rotta wrote on Facebook on Monday, also thanking the fire departments and first-aid squads that responded to the fire. “The house is completely gone. As much as this home was truly our family ‘happy place’ and we just cannot imagine not opening the door this June and immediately relaxing knowing we are home, we will rebuild! That much we know…we are lucky enough to have the privilege of rebuilding brick and mortar …we cannot replace people!”\n\nThe cause of the fire is under investigation.\nFios1 News also reported the hero was the quick-thinking Farrand, a Green Pond, N.J., native who played football at Maryland from 2011-14.\nFarrand told the Daily Record last April that he’s still pursuing his NFL dream.\n“It’s kind of frustrating, to be honest,” Farrand said. “I was close. I was there. I was with the Giants in Week 1, and I got a little taste of it. I say I worked 17 years for one week. I’m not very satisfied. … I can’t say I did what I wanted to do. That’s why I’m still here, still working.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T03:00:17.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
