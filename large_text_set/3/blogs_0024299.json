Lots of angry folks on both sides yelling at each other using very strong harsh language #wbz pic.twitter.com/6IJtDUv9Iy \n— Paul Burton (@PaulWBZ) March 25, 2017 \nArguments became more and more heated as the rally went on. At one point, Boston Police had to physically separate the two groups, moving them to opposite sides of the red brick line of the historic Freedom Trail. \nAnti-Trump organizer Trayjohn Wallace noted the tension, but said he wasn’t there for a fight. \n“As long as they don’t come over here inciting violence, we won’t incite violence either,” he said. \nWBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Karyn Regal reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T11:22:04.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
