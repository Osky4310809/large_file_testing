In a sanatorium, he met another sick teen, Ray Galton, who went on to become his long-term writing partner. \nGalton and Simpson wrote Hancock’s Half Hour for popular post-war comedian Tony Hancock. The show started out as a radio program before moving to BBC television in 1956. \nTheir biggest hit was Steptoe and Son , a sitcom about father-and-son junk dealers, which debuted in 1962 and ran until 1974. Producer Norman Lear adapted it into the U.S. sitcom Sanford and Son , which ran for six seasons on NBC. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k3uwH7 NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
