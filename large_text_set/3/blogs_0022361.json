'Maximum activity' \nGeorge Caldow, head of SAC Consulting veterinary services, said: \"It can be difficult to predict how widespread any infection will turn out to have been or to be but there are some important points that give us an indication of the likely impact that SBV infection will have this spring on Scottish livestock. \n\"In winter 2016-2017 SRUC vets have not diagnosed SBV in either early lambing flocks in Scotland or in all year round calving dairy herds in Scotland. \n\"It is therefore inferred that at the time of maximum midge activity in 2016 there was unlikely to have been SBV present in the midges in Scotland otherwise we would have seen cases in these two categories of animals.\" \nHe said it could be that only a small number of ewes had been affected in the south of the country. \nSAC Consulting said it expected the higher risk would be to cattle mated in the summer of 2017 and at the edge of the northward progression of infected midges. \nHowever, it said there might only be \"limited spread\" into Scotland as was seen in a previous epidemic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:40:00.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
