A photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST \n\"We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters.\" \nThe double bundle of joy will be siblings for Beyonce and Jay Z's first child, daughter Blue Ivy, who turned five last month. \nThe pregnancy news comes less than a year after the couple, which wed in 2008, was dogged by rumours of an impending divorce, after Beyonce released her groundbreaking album and accompanying short film Lemonade, which detailed a relationship's ups and downs. \nMany believed the emotional journey, about a cheating lover and a couple's subsequent reconciliation, was about the stars' own marriage, but the pair has never publicly addressed the speculation. \nJay Z and Beyonce have been eager to expand their family for some time. After the 2012 birth of Blue Ivy, the rapper revealed the couple had previously suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage, and Beyonce went on to open up about their family plans in a 2013 interview with Oprah Winfrey. \nShe explained, \"I definitely want another child... It was important for me to do what I love and I love to perform and I love to make music, so I wanted to have my daughter and see if I was still as passionate. \n\"Maybe after this next tour I'll maybe have another baby.\" Online Editors Follow @Indo_Style_ Your Comments Comments that are judged to be defamatory, abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted.
