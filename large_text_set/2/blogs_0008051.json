They haven't kept Joe West, Iris's father, in the loop. \nSo while his two sons -- Barry and Wally -- are speeding around trying to find a way to change reality for the better and his daughter's life is in imminent danger, Joe has been oblivious and, to an extent, focusing on his relationship. \nIt always seemed like it was going to be a big mistake, and it came to a head when they finally told him on tonight's episode and he blew up. \nDuring an interview with series star Keiynan Lonsdale, who plays Wally, earlier this week, he told us that he saw it coming. \n\"We're always talking about trying to be open with each other and we know from experience that secrets don't bode well, and here we go again,\" Lonsdale told ComicBook.com. \"It's a lesson to be learned. At the same time, these characters are conflicted. This isn't something that people deal with. This isn't something that people are prepared for. So mistakes are going to be made, it's understandable.\" \nOf course, we'll see how it all plays out. As of this writing, Iris's life hangs in the balance as a result of something unrelated, and that usually tends to bring Team Flash back together, no matter what else is going on. \nYou can check out the official episode synopsis below, along with photos from the episode in the attached gallery. And if you haven't already, don't forget to rate The Flash in the ComicBook .com TV Database. \nTHE TOUCH OF DEATH – Barry (Grant Gustin) and the team at S.T.A.R. Labs work together to bring down Clive Yorkin (guest star Matthew Kevin Anderson), a criminal meta-human who is methodically killing people by causing them to decompose at an accelerated rate. Joe (Jesse L. Martin) becomes his next target but it’s Iris (Candice Patton) who is caught in the crossfire. The Flash mentors Kid Flash (Keiynan Lonsdale) and begins to elevate the newer speedster’s training to another level. \nRob Hardy directed the episode written by Brooke Roberts & Judalina Neira.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:58:58.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
