It claims that Arsenal players are confident that Arsene Wenger will sign a new contract that will keep him at the club for the next two years. This hasn’t stopped the board from making contingency plans to appoint a new boss should Wenger walk. He will make his decision in March or April. It depends on how they finish the season and the mood around the club. \nInsiders claim that he’s still as determined and hungry for success as ever. He hasn’t told his backroom staff that he’s ready to walk away and it’s something he would keep them in the loop about given that their own jobs would be at risk if a new boss was appointed. So it looks like Gooners can look forward to two more years of Wenger. \nThe Times report that he’s currently plotting for the future at the Emirates: ‘Wenger has already been involved in making plans for next season at Arsenal, from giving contract extensions to players such as Per Mertesacker, the captain, and determining the offers that the club are prepared to make to Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez, to giving his views on travel plans, training schedules and hotel bookings for the pre-season tour of Australia. Arsenal play FC Sydney and Western Sydney Wanderers on July 13 and 15 in the club’s first visit to Australia for 40 years.’ The rest of the season \nWhile they’re almost certainly out of the Champions League after being destroyed by Bayern Munich in the first leg of their last 16 tie, Arsenal are still fighting on two fronts. Ten points behind Chelsea, a title win is unlikely but with 13 games to play, a good run of form could change those odds. They’re also in the FA Cup quarter-final vs Lincoln City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:35:58.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
