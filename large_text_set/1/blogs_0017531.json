These two individuals, along with the injured robber, were taken to local hospital, said San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood.\nTwo other people— a woman who complained of chest pains and a pregnant woman who had labor pains — were also taken to local hospitals, Hood said.\nThe condition of the people who were injured in the incident was not immediately available.\nMcManus says police are still looking for the other robber who is believed to have left the mall.\n“We searched the mall and we feel as confident as we can feel that the suspect is not in there,” McManus said.\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:27:13.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
