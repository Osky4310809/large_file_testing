By Jeffrey Matulef Published 04/01/2017 \nMany were delighted to demo 2014's excellent first-person stealth horror game Alien: Isolation using the Oculus Rift only to be disappointed when the full game launched without any VR support at all . Fans of xenomorphs and virtual reality will be delighted to hear that Ridley Scott's upcoming film, Alien: Covenant, is getting its very own VR game spin-off. \nAs reported by Variety , the Alien: Covenant Virtual Reality Experience will be available as a paid app on \"major VR platforms\". \nThe VR spin-off, produced by the film's director and series creator Ridley Scott, is described by developer Fox Innovation Lab as \"a dread-inducing journey into the depths of the Alien universe.\" \nThe worrying bit is that Ridley Scott's production company, RSA Films, collaborated with Fox Innovation Lab before on a VR game for Scott's last film, The Martian, and the resulting product received rather poor reviews . This one has a different director on board with visual effects artist David Karlak, so hopefully Scott's second attempt at a licensed VR game will prove more worthwhile. \nAlien: Covenant will arrive in theaters on 19th May in the UK and US. The game will likely launch around then too.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T05:10:55.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
