"Tweet \nLeke Baiyewu, Abuja \nThe Senate, on Tuesday, asked the Federal Government to be responsible for the repairs of the properties lost to the recent clash between the Hausa and the Yoruba in Ile-Ife, Osun State. \nThe upper chamber of the National Assembly also called for compensation for families of those who lost their lives in the crisis. \nThe decision was based on a motion moved by Senator Jibrin Barau (Kano North) and co-sponsored by Senator Shehu Sani (Kaduna Central). \nThe lawmakers, as part of their resolutions, “Urge the Federal Government to bear the cost of rebuilding the burnt houses and businesses, and pay adequate compensation to the families of the bereaved victims and the injured as a matter of utmost urgency.” \nBarau, in the motion, said the Senate noted with dismay the recent clash in Ile-Ife, Osun State, between the indigenes of the town and the Hausa community “in a dispute said to be essentially between two persons.” \nHe said, “The Senate observes that the dispute came at a time when strenuous efforts were being made to build bridges of understanding between and among all ethnics groups in the country as a symbol of one people united under one nation. \n“The Senate further notes that Ile-lfe holds a special place in the consciousness of the Yoruba race as their ancestral home and in which other ethnic groups, including the Hausa, have lived and thrived for several decades, if not centuries. \n“It is conscious of the fact that the amity could not have been achieved if the people of Ile-lfe were not a part of a race that is very accommodating, as exemplified by the fact that the immediate past Ooni of Ife, Oba (Okunade) Sijuwade was the closest traditional ruler, friend and ally to the late Emir of Kano, Alhaji Ado Bayero. \n“The Senate further observes that the present Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, since his ascension, has demonstrated an uncommon zeal of symbol of unity among the diverse peoples of the country. \n“It regrets that in the recent clash in the ancient city of lle-Ife, several people were reportedly killed and scores of houses and businesses burnt in an orgy of anger, which invited the attention of the Inspector General of Police and the (Nigerian) Army high command.” \nThe lawmakers also resolved to “observe a minute silence for the dead victims of the clash; and call on the Inspector General of Police that, while he tries as much as humanly possible to prevent a re-occurrence of such dispute in Ile-Ife or anywhere else in the country, he should conduct a thorough investigation into the remote and immediate causes of the Ile-Ife dispute and prosecute the perpetrators.” \nSani, while seconding the motion, recalled that since 1941 when the Northern and Southern Protectorates were amalgamated to form Nigeria and since its independence in 1960, there had been series of ethnic and religious clashes in most parts of the country. \nHe said, “Ethnic clashes represent a clear and present danger to Nigeria’s unity and to our peace. As a regional and continental power, Nigeria should lay a good example of interethnic harmony, peace and tolerance. \nIt is most unfortunate that this is happening at this very time when all hands are on deck to further strengthen the unity of our country. It is most unfortunate that this is happening in the cradle of Yoruba race, where we all respect with all dignity. \n“We should look at it from a broader sense: if a Hausa man is unsafe in Ibadan or Ile-Ife and a Yoruba man is unsafe in Enugu or Aba and an Igbo man is unsafe in Sabongeri in Kano, I think is time for us to tell ourselves the truth and that truth is the fact that we need to do all we can – to do everything we can – to discuss those fundamental issues that always ignite such kinds of violence.” \nIn his submission, Senator James Manager (Delta South), “We have a very chequered history and the chequered history in Nigeria is closely related to this ethnic tension, suspicions and doubts in the country. Therefore, if we have a disagreement in some parts of this country, as a Senate of unity, we have every reason to be worried. \n“Recently, the National Assembly was very worried about the xenophobic attacks in South Africa. That is far away from this country but in Africa. Nigerians felt very bad and we expressed our anger and bitterness over what happened. If we are condemning what is happening to our brothers and sisters outside this country because they are being attacked, why must Nigerians be attacked within this country? It sends very wrong signals, not just to us but to the international community.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:59:54.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
