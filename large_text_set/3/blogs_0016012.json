So how do you release the anxiety and let money flow? \nManifestation practice teaches us that the way to allow the money you’ve manifested is to relax. But when you’re stressed out about money, it’s difficult to relax. In fact, when you’re worried about money, it’s often all you can think about.\nIt consumes every single thought and becomes a filter through which you see the world. This horrible, heavy, emotional feeling settles over your body. You feel tired and demotivated. You battle to focus or think.\nThat last one is really the crux of the matter isn’t it? When you battle to focus or think, you often can’t create the movement you need to get you out of the money crisis.\nTurn off the stress hormones caused by money anxiety Think back to a time when you nearly had an accident while driving in a car. After the near-miss occurred, a distinct physical sensation rushed over your body. \nFor some people they got immediately hot, while others got suddenly cold. For most, your heart started racing, your mouth got dry, you developed a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach and you felt nervous or startled. You may even have developed an instant headache.\nWhen your body experiences a shock or trauma, it releases stress hormones like adrenalin and cortisol.\nThese hormones trigger responses designed to help you run away or fight. They also take blood away from your forebrain, which is why you can’t think clearly.\nYour body now goes into a habitual response mode, meaning you act on habit instead of thinking. Often, these habits include patterns like overthinking when we have money anxiety. \nIf you were retrenched or let go , you almost definitely went through a shock experience. If your money worries are long-term, then you’re experiencing low-grade stress on an ongoing basis.\nWhen these stress hormones are pumped into your system, you have no natural mechanism that switches them off. So long-term money worries mean that you are just adding layer upon layer of stress hormones into your system.\nThis is likely also the culprit behind any new belly fat you’re carrying lately.\nThe solution? Use the ‘ Go Ape ‘ process to turn your stress hormones off. \nAs with all energy healing techniques, you can use this multiple times a day. It will not interfere with any medication or other treatments.\nProcess money anxiety more quickly There are certain effects of mental and emotional overload acknowledged in many alternative healing practices. \nOne such effect is that the sphenobasilar junction, a bone in the skull, gets stuck.\nThe SB Junction, commonly called the Butterfly Bone, joins all the different bones of the skull. When you release it regularly, you’re able to think more clearly. You can also process emotion and thoughts inside you more effectively.\nThe Butterfly Release is an adaptation of a Craniosacral Therapy process. It enables you to release the SB Junction without the help of a healing practitioner. \nUsed daily, for 3 to 6 minutes per sitting, the Butterfly Release will not interfere with medication or other healing modalities.\nTap your K27 points to release money anxiety Perfect for in the moment help when you need a quick fix, tapping your K27 points will simply look like you’re touching your chest. No one will even know you’re running a process! \nTake your index finger and thumb and place it on the inside of your collarbone, where the bony protrusion is.\nNow move your hand down about an inch and feel around: your index finger and thumb should each find a sore spot. These are the K27 points of your kidney meridian.\nRub or tap lightly on these points while saying the name of the feeling you want to program into your system. \nFor example, try saying ‘peace and forgiveness’ over and over while tapping. You should feel calmer and more peaceful within a few seconds.\nFinally, banish all doubt around money anxiety Often, the first thing anyone says to you when you’re having a rough time is ‘keep your chin up,’ or ‘stay positive.’ \nEven manifestation practice tells us to keep the faith and believe – despite the lack of results we may see. This can be really hard to do though.\nThe reasons it’s hard to do? Usually because your inner voice is running riot. When it comes to money anxiety, you’re often thinking things like:\nHow much money do I need at the end of the month? How much do I have? How much am I short? What can I sell? Who can I ask? You recognize the trend – and the list of potential thoughts is endless.\nEvery time you think one of these thoughts, the very thought assumes you won’t make it, that you will need an alternative solution.\n“What can I sell” manifests the reality that you have to sell something. “Who can I ask” manifests the reality that you will have to ask for help.\nTo banish all these thoughts of doubt, you need one tool that is easy to remember. The simplest will be a mantra or chant. \nCreate a goal statement for yourself, like:\n10,000 in the bank at the end of the month 3 new paying clients by the end of the month 20 healing sessions by the end of the month What’s important is that it is a fixed goal and has a fixed timeline. It must be measurable and within a timespan.\nEvery single time you have a thought of doubt, chant your goal statement or mantra. Repeat it over and over and over again – out loud if you can. Use the mantra to drown out your thoughts of money anxiety.\nBy doing this many times a day, you achieve two powerful goals. \nFirst, you retrain your inner voice pretty quickly.\nLots of repetition means you’ll feel better within a shorter period of time. Your inner voice will become more positive.\nSecond, you begin the process of manifestation itself.\nThe high volume of repetition means your goal will likely manifest much more quickly.\nSo not only are you feeling better, you’re putting out the energy that will get you out of this money anxiety.\nIt’s important to try and force yourself to feel better as much as possible. \nAt least try not to let the negative feelings weigh you down. Get up, move around, do something different.\nWhen we let ourselves be lazy because of overwhelming emotion, it can be very difficult to get going again.\nSometimes the answer is simply that you have to force yourself to get up and get moving. So just do it!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:16:05.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
