To aid and enable this particular addiction, we thought it would be fun to do a quick round up of all the fun fashion things we saw at Lakme Fashion Week this season. And so as to not spook you, we're just going to leave it here and go. Here goes nothing... Antar Agni \nDesigner Ujjwal Dubey brought some draped silhouettes to the fore, that might seem a tad unconventional, but were so comfy looking. Plus, he kept the colour tones muted, simple and solid, just how most men like it. Anuj Bhutani \nFor desginer Anuj Bhutani, whether it was a casual pyjamas and tshirt look or a more formal jacket and trousers look, the key was layering. Kunal Rawal \nKunal Rawal's show was in association with Lamborghini as they launched the much-awaited Huracan Spyder. The collection titled a 'Race For Separates' featured a blend of East and West influences and were all summer friendly styles that included kurtas, bandhgalas and jackets that can be worn as separates too. Narendra Kumar \nNarendra Kumar's collection, 'The Millenials' was presented by Burgoyne - the leading Irish linen manufacturers and used linen to showcase tailored athleisure looks for both boys and men. The style evolved from youthful experimentation to that of a polished man who has come into his own. Anushree Reddy \nWho says flowers are just for girls? Anushree Reddy's summery collection featured some lovely Indian wear for men in soft pastels and pretty florals prints that we think would look great this summer. Khanijo \nGaurav Khanijo makes casuals look so slick, you won't even believe it. Who says you need to always be in a 3-piece suit or a bandhgala to look absolutely smashing? Tarun Tahiliani \nTrust Tarun Tahiliani to really bring it with both his women's and his men's line this summer. Sticking to whites and blacks over all, his Indian wear had something very contemporary to it. It was desi , no doubt, but in a very polished James Bond way. Anita Dongre \nAnita Dongre's Finale was incredible for many reasons, one being the super fine men's creations that also featured gota pati work that was seen through the collection. She to, stuck to white and brought forth some summery specials. Rajesh Pratap Singh \nRajesh Pratap Singh who was one part of the 3 designer show for the #SustainableMan finale show on Textile Day stuck to the blue colour palette but played around with prints, patchwork and layering to create some uber interesting looks. We especially liked the jackets in this collection. Pero \nPero by Aneeth Arora was the third installment of the #SustainableMan show and focused on ultra wearable clothes for the young guy. Here again, printed jackets were paired with striped pants, checks and stripes were put together and so on, but somehow it all worked. Abraham & Thakore \nWhite is undoubtedly the colour of summer and even though Abraham & Thakore colour-blocked it with darker hues in some cases, the focus remained on the winning summer colour - white.
