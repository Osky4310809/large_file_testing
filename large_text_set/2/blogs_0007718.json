But updating social media accounts after landing a new job is probably not high on the engineer’s to-do list. \nUber did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nStill a sci-fi fantasy, flying cars may one day escape movie screens and book pages to make real-life daily commute more efficient. \nBased on Uber’s vision of the future, folks will hitch a ride in one of its branded cars (self-driving or otherwise) to the local “vertiport,” where air-taxi passengers take off and land on their way to the office or home. The technology aims to reduce vehicle noise and emissions while increasing autonomy. \n“A network of small, electric aircraft that take off and land vertically … will enable rapid, reliable transportation between suburbs and cities and, ultimately, within cities,” the Uber paper said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:34:06.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
