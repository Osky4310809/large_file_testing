To me, it's a party. \"And 'party' has worked perfectly well all my life.\" \nLast week, the Lord was chastised by a Sky News presenter after a \"sexist\" slip-up. \nHe told Sky's Sarah-Jane Mee: \"I don't in any way criticise her for this, she's got a man-sized job to do and she's very busy. \n\"I've been working very constructively with three different Secretaries of State in the twilight world of politics doing the job that I know how to do best\". Lord Heseltine: 'She's got a man-sized job to do' @skysarahjane : 'It's a woman-size job now' #internationalwomensday https://t.co/NX9uY7Nygg — Zoe Catchpole (@mazoe) March 8, 2017 \nM r Heseltine was then interrupted by the presenter, who said: \"She's got a man-sized job? It's a woman-sized job now\". \nSmiling, the peer said: \"As I said it, I knew you wouldn't be able to resist that\". \nShe replied: \"Well, it is International Women's Day!\" \nIn response, Lord Heseltine conceded: \"No, you're perfectly right. I find myself chastised by you\". \nMr Heseltine also accused Brexit supporters of naivety over the Prime Minister's plans for dealing with Europe.
