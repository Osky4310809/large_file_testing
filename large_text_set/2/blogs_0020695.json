The hoax article, which comes from a site whose URL is tailored to resemble that of ABS-CBN and contains info plagiarized from Wikipedia, claims that Patrimonio's wife Cindy Conwi-Patrimonio told a radio program that the 4-time MVP passed away due to cardiac arrest. Conwi-Patrimonio was quick to dismiss the rumor in a statement released on her Facebook page on Friday, February 24. “To all the loving fans, our beautiful friends, sa mga pangit na babaeng ilusyonada sa asawa ko… Alvin did not die. That rumor came out 2 days ago,” she shared on her Facebook account. (To all the loving fans, our beautiful friends, to all the ugly delusional women… Alvin did not die. That rumor came out 2 days ago.) “IT IS NOT TRUE THAT Alvin Patrimonio died. I appreciate your concerns.” “He had a check up lang, that was it. A simple check up kaya ‘wag kayong mag-alala. Thank you. Pls share,” she closed. (He had a check-up, that was it. A simple check-up, so you don’t have to worry. Thank you. Please share.) Patrimonio, 50, was named one of the PBA's greatest players by the league in 2000, and was also a part of the list of 40 greatest players in 2015.
