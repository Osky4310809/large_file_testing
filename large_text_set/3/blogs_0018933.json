He has flourished under Leonardo Jardim at Stade Louis II, helping the principality club to the top of Ligue 1 and into the Champions League quarter-finals. \nHis vibrant displays have resulted in interest from some of Europe’s biggest clubs, but while he said that he holds great ambitions, he is willing to be patient. \n“The risk is going to going to a big club to be a replacement, to go backwards and to be loaned away – it’s complicated,” he told RMC . “My criteria, it’s playing time. After that, if a club I could not refuse guaranteed me time to play, I would have to think. \n“Every player wants to play against the best in the best leagues. Today, I’m lucky to play with Monaco in a good team. We’re in the Champions League, we’re scoring lots of goals and we’re still capable of winning every competition. \n“I’m very happy at Monaco.” \nSidibe has played 38 times for the Ligue 1 leaders this season, producing three goals and five assists. ​", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:55:57.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
