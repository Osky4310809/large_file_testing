Getty 0 Feb 21, 2017 14:27:00 There were plenty more profitable stats-based bets for Soccerway members over the weekend including a clean sweep of three FA Cup selections Regular readers of the Soccerway guide will already know what a valuable resource the weekly publication is for bettors, and the latest edition was no different. \nEach week, the team behind the site utilise the range of tools available to punters, as well as the latest Opta facts, to come up with a range of bets which are backed up by the statistics. \nThey cover a wide range of angles from across the world, mirroring the huge variety of competitions available to Soccerway users. \nDo you like the numbers to back up your weekend picks? Then register now to ensure that every future edition is delivered directly to your email inbox every Friday. It's quick, simple and free. \nWhether you're interested in head-to-head records, an in depth look at the decent form or analysis on goal times, there are dozens of angles covered in every version. \nLeading the way in Edition 22 was a hat-trick of winners from the FA Cup fifth round, inspired by the latest information from Opta. A low-scoring game was on the cards as Championship high-flyers Huddersfield hosted Manchester City and the subsequent 0-0 draw landed a 13/10 (2.30). \nMilwall's potential for an upset provided a correct pick at Even money (2.0) as the Lions knocked out Leicester City while a goal-filled win for Manchester United was tipped up at the same price. \nThe biggest priced winner this week came from Shrewsbury's victory over AFC Wimbledon which was priced at 17/10 (2.70). There was another winner from the Football League too, as Bradford and Bolton both found the net at 11/10 (2.10). \nThe icing on the cake would have been an 8/1 (9.0) accumulator win but the bet fell just short, with four out of five correct selections. The column has already provided three winning accumulators this season but a fourth proved just out of reach. \nWhether you're a punter looking for help with your next acca, searching for in depth analysis on the upcoming fixtures or an interest bet on a televised fixture, the Soccerway guide provides plenty of free picks every weekend. \nIt's easy to get a copy of the next release, simply register to become a Soccerway member and you'll get Edition 23 delivered to your inbox as soon as it's available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:15:26.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
