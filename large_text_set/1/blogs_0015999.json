(Photo: John Reed, USA TODAY Sports) AUBURN, Ala. — Auburn made it look easy at times against a bad LSU team Wednesday night. The homesteading Tigers built a big lead and held off a few rallies for a 78-74 victory against LSU, delivering Bruce Pearl the 500th win of his college coaching career. LSU committed 15 turnovers and seemingly could not get much going offensively in the first 10 minutes of the second half. Bruce Pearl will certainly thank his Tigers with the easiest win yet of the SEC season, even if it did come down to the final minutes. Crucial win at right time A loss at home to LSU, perhaps the second-worst team in the SEC, would have been devastating to Auburn’s postseason hopes (the NIT). LSU certainly made it interesting and built an 11-point lead in the first half, but coach Johnny Jones’ squad allowed Auburn to end the half on a 20-6 run and Auburn came out firing in the second half to grab a 15-point lead in the first eight minutes. Auburn did not look the part a stellar team at times, but it didn’t need to be Wednesday night against the out-of-sorts LSU roster. Auburn had to win this game, especially with news arriving before tipoff that leading scorer Antonio Blakeney was out of action with an ankle injury. It wasn’t pretty in spurts — but it was pretty at other times — but the win was much needed and pulled the Tigers closer to .500 with a big game coming against rival Alabama, which is 4-1 in the SEC. That’s a bad LSU team Injuries or not, LSU’s team looked all kinds of lackluster on the floor. Whether it was every single player committing a turnover by the midpoint of the second half — until Kieran Hayward was inserted in the lineup. Auburn’s RPI will not get a big boost from this win, but avoiding a loss was crucial. It will be interesting to see what LSU does the remainder of the season with a roster not able to win and a coach who has been unable to adjust at crucial moments. He had only one timeout remaining with 16:56 remaining in the game. *** Get free breaking news in the Auburn Undercover newsletter *** When all else fails, drive to the basket LSU cut Auburn’s lead to 2 points with 6 minutes remaining, and then T.J. Dunans tried to take over by driving to the basket. His active play kept LSU honest around the perimeter and opened up shots for others on the floor. His ump shot with 33.2 seconds remaining gave Auburn a 75-71 lead it would not relinquish -- and Horace Spencer put the exclamation point on the win with a breakaway dunk less than 20 seconds later. Dunans and Mustapha Heron co-led Auburn with 12 points apiece. Those drives along the base line resulted in extra passes, an Auburn crowd underneath the basket and Anfernee McLemore was able to hit a outback and af res throw on the foul to put Auburn ahead 66-61 with less than 5 minutes remaining. Dunans changes the game for the Tigers and they need to rely on him more, even when things break down, off the dribble. His teammates followed suit. Ronnie Johnson hit a layup high off the glass to keep LSU at arm’s length on the possession following McLemore’s free throw and then extended the lead to eight with another layup and foul in the final 2 minutes. Kudos to Pearl Bruce Pearl has never experienced this much losing in his career. He had never experienced a losing season as a head coach — a stretch tat began at Southern Indiana in 1992 — until he arrived at Auburn. He has surpassed the number of wins the Tigers pieced together last season already and they have a shot at reaching the NIT. Still, coaching up these youngsters and rebuilding this program has certainly been the toughest job (and three years) of his coaching life. Things will start to pay off at some point for Pearl and getting a moment to celebrate amid the hard work of rebuilding a program that was in the dumps when Tony Barber was fired three years ago. Enjoy the win, Bruce. The road gets tougher from here, but at least you have the pieces in place to compete.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T06:04:50.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
