All he had to do was make a simple pass, or even boot it up the field. He had any number of options, but one bad option was completely missing on his attempt to kick the ball. And yet that’s what he did. \nThere are a lot of bad own goals. There are a lot of defensive mistakes. Rarely do defenders completely miss a slowly rolling ball with no one around them and end up on their rear end, though. This is an all-timer. \nBless Vestergaard. Without him, we wouldn’t have laughed quite so hard today. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:17:31.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
