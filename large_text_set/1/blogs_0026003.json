Help us by reporting it \nExperience a totally new way to share today. Snap a photo or a video, add a caption, and send it to a friend (or maybe a few). They'll view it, laugh, and then the snap disappears from the screen - unless they take a screenshot. If you want to share a Snap with all of your friends, add it to your Snapchat Story, where each Snap lives for 24 hours until it disappears, making room for the new. \nThe images might be a little grainy, and you may not look your best, but that's the point. It's about the moment, a connection between friends in the present, and not just a pretty picture. \nThe allure of fleeting messages reminds us about the beauty of friendship - we don't need a reason to stay in touch. \nFeatures: They'll have that long to view your message and then it disappears forever. We'll let you know if they take a screenshot. Build relationships, collect points, and view your best friends. Snapchat is instantly fun and insanely playful. Show your friends how clever you can be and enjoy the lightness of being. \nRequirements: Front facing camera support on Android 2.3 and above. \nWhat's New: Snapchat has a new look! Tap To View - Now it only takes one tap to view a Snap or Story. Improved Snapcodes Tap your Snapcode to add a selfie Add by Snapcode - Screenshot a friend's Snapcode, then go to Add Friends to add them Share your Snapcode - Export your Snapcode directly from the app \nNote: Snapchat 10 doesn't no work on rooted device.
