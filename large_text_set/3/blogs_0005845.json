Japanese jets have also scrambled to observe Chinese maritime military movements. \nBeijing has never excluded the possibility of taking military action to recoup what it considers to be a rogue province. On Tuesday, Taiwan deployed anti-aircraft missiles while promising to step up military patrols to offset China’s expanding defensive and offensive military abilities, RT reported. © AFP 2016/ STR Beijing Outmaneuvering US Navy in South China Sea “Looking ahead at the transformation of China’s strategy and its investment in new weapons equipment, our military will practice new reforms in our training,” Taiwanese defense minister Feng Shih-kuan said during an address to parliament. \nOn Thursday, the People’s Liberation sent 13 fighter jets, heavy bombers, and early-warning aircraft through the Miyako Strait between Japan’s Okinawa and Miyako islands, according to the Japanese defense ministry.

The trips are designed to reinforce China’s claims over the South China Sea, the Press Trust of India added. The ship will carry 308 passengers for a tour of Yinyu, Quanfu, and Yagong during a four-day, three-night cruise, according to a spokesman for Hainan Strait Shipping, the entity that owns the cruise ship. \nVietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan have all clashed on which country is the true owner of the Paracel islands, PTI reports. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:10:55.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
