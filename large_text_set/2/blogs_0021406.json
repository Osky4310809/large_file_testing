The new car will be sold under the new Italdesign Automobili Speciali brand, established to offer ultra-low-volume production vehicles to select customers. \nGiven that the company is now owned by Lamborghini , it should come as no surprise to find that the car looks a little bit like a refugee from Sant’Agata. Even more so when you discover that the head of innovation design is in fact former Lamborghini design director Filippo Perini, who joined Italdesign after its iconic founder Giorgetto Giugiaro left in 2015. \nBelieve it or not, there’s a unifying design theme behind this madness. The lines are softer and smoother above the shoulder line, in keeping with Italian gran turismo tradition, while the portion below that line is devoted to aerodynamics. Be that as it may, the bewildering amount of scoops, flics and spoilers that dot every inch is quite a departure from the elegant, minimalist designs that characterised the Giugiaro name. \nUnder the rather overwrought skin, the new car is essentially a rebodied Audi R8 , using the latter’s aluminium and carbon fibre spaceframe. It also uses Ingolstadt’s 5.2 litre direct-injected, naturally-aspirated V10 that’s also shared with the Lamborghini Huracán . \nWhile output figures have yet to be released, the car’s quoted zero-to-100 km/h sprint time of 3.2 seconds and its top speed in excess of 330 km/h leads us to believe that the engine is from the uprated R8 Plus model, producing 610 hp and 560 Nm. The Audi’s seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and all-wheel drive system should also be retained here. \nBuyers will be able to customise their cars to their liking through finishing and performance packages that will be offered. The company also signed a collaboration with Swiss watchmaker Roger Dubuis to create an exclusive eight-piece collection of the latter’s Excalibur Spider watches.
