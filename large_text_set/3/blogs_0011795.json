The handset provides a mid-tier option for interested in its P series, coming in at £299 (~$370) compared to the £549 Huawei P10 ($677) and £649 ($800) Huawei P10 Plus .\nThe P10 lite features a 2.5D double-sided glass design, 5.2-inch Full-HD display, and a Kirin 658 chipset with 16nm octa-core CPU. It’s also packing 4 GB of RAM and a 3,000 mAh battery with 18W fast-charge technology — said to provide a full charge in 90 minutes.\nThere’s a 12 MP camera on the rear with 1.25μm single pixel sensor – which should offer strong shots even in low light conditions, and an 8 MP camera at the front, and the unit comes running EMUI 5.1, based on Android Nougat , out of the box.\n\nHuawei’s “Knuckle Sense” gesture makes an appearance for the first time in one of its ‘lite’ devices too, allowing users to create shortcuts by drawing on the screen with their knuckles (it’s not a must-have feature), while the P10 lite also features Huawei staples like microSD card support and a fingerprint scanner.\nSee also: Huawei P10 gets high praise for its dual cameras with DxOMark score of 87 7 days ago The P10 lite is up for pre-order from today in the UK, with general availability starting March 31. It can be picked up from retailers such as the Carphone Warehouse, EE and Vodafone, in both black and gold variants.\nTo check out what we think of the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus , read our full review at the link.\nWhat are your thoughts on the P10 Lite?
