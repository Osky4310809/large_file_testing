In order to live up to that expectation and have the man power to stop Thanos after he has filled the Infinity Gauntlet with all six Infinity Stones, it will be all hands on deck in the MCU. Not only will the regular Avengers team reunite after a rather unfriendly encounter in Captain America: Civil War , but the films will also see other Marvel heroes join the ranks of the Avengers themselves and their film franchise.\nThe likes of Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man, and Black Panther are set to make their first appearances in any Avengers films here, while the movies will also see the Guardians of the Galaxy presumably come to Earth to meet up with the rest of the MCU’s heroes. The combined force of these characters is undeniable, as is the star power – which is why one Infinity War cast member can’t imagine how difficult this all must be from a logistical point of view.\nBautista spoke to Collider at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and was asked about the potential for every single Marvel hero to be on set the same day for Infinity War and Avengers 4 . While Bautista had yet to begin filming at the time of the interview, he said he thinks it would be extremely difficult for Marvel to figure out a schedule that allows for twenty or more individuals to all be free on the same day:\nI think they’re going to have to because to bring in that many people who are just so busy, it’s got to be a logistics nightmare. So when they say that there’s something that’s delayed, I don’t even ask because I totally get it. I can totally just empathize with them. I can’t imagine that this is an easy task.\nFrom the outside looking in, it would appear to be nearly impossible for Marvel to round up Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Brie Larson , Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch , Chadwick Boseman, and so on for a single day of filming on Infinity War . Hopefully this is not the case and thanks to careful and meticulous planning on their part, Marvel has figured out how to make this happen.\nThat said, it is not uncommon for actors in these larger films to go throughout an entire production without meeting some of their co-stars. While there is surely going to be a scene in one of the next two Avengers films that has every Marvel hero together fighting with one another, that does not mean that they will all be there filming that scene together. Iron Man, War Machine, Spider-Man, Rocket, Groot, Hulk, and others are going to be mostly CGI creations during fight scenes. Marvel can use stand-ins for these scenes for interactive purposes, but it is unnecessary to keep someone like Downey around to do that when his face will not be seen, except for in-helmet shots that can be added in post-production.\nAgain, hopefully there will be an instance outside of the stage of Comic-Con or D23 that every Marvel hero is together in costume (that is, onscreen ), but the chances of that happening are slim. However, as production kicks off on the third and fourth Avengers installments, any future set photos that show actors interacting with one another, makes it that much more possible that they will share the screen too.\nSource: Collider", "external_links": ["http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chris-Pratt-as-Star-Lord-and-Chris-Hemsworth-as-Thor-in-the-MCU.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chris-Pratt-as-Star-Lord-and-Chris-Hemsworth-as-Thor-in-the-MCU.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chris-Pratt-as-Star-Lord-and-Chris-Hemsworth-as-Thor-in-the-MCU.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://collider.com/avengers-infinity-war-production-date/?utm_campaign=collidersocial&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social#drax-dave-bautista", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chris-Pratt-as-Star-Lord-and-Chris-Hemsworth-as-Thor-in-the-MCU.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chris-Pratt-as-Star-Lord-and-Chris-Hemsworth-as-Thor-in-the-MCU.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chris-Pratt-as-Star-Lord-and-Chris-Hemsworth-as-Thor-in-the-MCU.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chris-Pratt-as-Star-Lord-and-Chris-Hemsworth-as-Thor-in-the-MCU.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chris-Pratt-as-Star-Lord-and-Chris-Hemsworth-as-Thor-in-the-MCU.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=708&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-23T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:08:48.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
