The piece, entitled “ Why Hollywood can’t stand Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell ,” is a perfect little capsule of celebrity gossip, and one that convinced me of its claim (that Hollywood big shots are sick of Bell and Shepard near-constant oversharing to the press) with stunning brevity. Advertisement \nThere are no lengthy quotes or attempts to provide multiple sources, just a simple statement ( Shepard and Bell have “industry types gagging” at how “embarrassingly overexposed” they behave in interviews and other public appearances ) followed by six hilarious examples of the couple’s cringeworthy oversharing (one of which is, simply, “quitting sugar.”) The story then comes to an abrupt end, as if Coleman is saying, “Wouldn’t you be annoyed by them, too?” The answer, of course, is yes. \nSo it was written, and so it shall be believed.
