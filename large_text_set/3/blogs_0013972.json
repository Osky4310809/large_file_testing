Too bad for what happened at the end, but we have proved once again to have a soul. \n\"I don't feel penalised and the team must not feel like victims – we must focus on our next matches and our objective, the Europa League. \nThe evolution of Gini Wijnaldum \n\"The match against Juve is in the past, we are now focusing on this game and we need to prepare it well. \n\"Genoa have got nothing to lose and will play to win the game. Then next week we will have the international break.\" \nMilan, who have been out of Europe for the last three seasons, will be without suspended striker Carlos Bacca.
