Not only did the applicant have to lose their original reproductive ability, but they were not allowed to keep their sperm or eggs frozen for the future either. Additionally, they had to get divorced and live as their new gender for at least two years. \nIn December 2012, a Swedish court ruled that these restrictions contradicted the European Convention on Human Rights, and the following year, it was officially overturned. \nSince then, the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights (RFSL) has been pushing for a legal apology and compensation to those who complied with the law. \n\"It is very welcome that the government, the first in the world, is paying compensation in recognition of the crimes committed by the state against transgender people,\" the organization said in a statement.

Between 1972 and 2011, 865 people applied for official gender reassignment, and 500 went ahead with it, though it is not clear how many of these are still alive. \nIn 2013, about 150 transgender men and women demanded a total of €5 million from the government with the help of RFSL, which says that in total, as many as 800 were affected by the law. \nDozens of countries around the world, including Russia, Switzerland and Italy, require sterilization as a prerequisite of a gender change. \nBut in few of those is the idea of sterilization as historically loaded as in Sweden. \nBetween 1935 and 1975 the country sterilized an estimated 63,000 people, some for reasons of medical safety, due to potential complications due to pregnancy, but most for eugenic reasons, as they carried genes that were considered unsuitable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:39:08.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
