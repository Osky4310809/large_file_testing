That’s why he’s been fighting for it.”   \nThey said the point was not to be voting at 3 a.m. in the morning, but in the clear light of day. \nHowever, yesterday the House Freedom Caucus announced that they had 25 votes against it. \nThat meant effectively, that Speaker Paul Ryan wouldn’t have enough votes to get it passed. \nSo there was a lot of horse trading and calls out to people trying to put the arm on them for their votes. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nIt sounds like they’re not there yet, but they think they’re close.   \nSo the delay will give a little more time. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nThe vote has been rescheduled for tomorrow morning.
