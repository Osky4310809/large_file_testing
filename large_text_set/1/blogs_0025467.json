It’s also fair to wonder whether that problem is worse than the ones created by the beer which is so freely marketed, branded and deemed official by the NFL.” matthoover4 says: Jan 31, 2017 9:11 AM \nSo let’s ban a company that sells healthy supplements and promotes an active, responsible lifestyle…but hey, bring on the beer, tortilla chip, and pizza commercials. Fat America thanks you for saving them great offense! osiris33 (bandwagon since 1976) says: Jan 31, 2017 9:12 AM \nBut “Spirit Cooking” Satanist Lady Gaga is the halftime “entertainment.” Gotta protect that shield. steelerfanjo says: Jan 31, 2017 9:31 AM \nThe NFL proves to be a joke. Beer & Junk food are fine. Lady Gagme, letting cheaters play… those are all fine. NFL is the WWE. largejk says: Jan 31, 2017 9:35 AM \nGNC just managed to get their advertising done without having to shell out 5 million for 30 seconds! well done NFL! LOL Jan 31, 2017 9:35 AM \nSB commercials are and have always been rubbish.
