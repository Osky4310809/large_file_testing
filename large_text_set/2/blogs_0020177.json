Apple AAPL said that it could take more than six months for the more than 12,000 Apple employees who will work there to move in. Additionally, Apple said that construction on Apple Park will continue through the summer as crews complete other buildings and landscaping.\nApple Park was the brainchild of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs . During his final years at Apple, Jobs was one of the foremost proponents of building a sprawling new campus in Cupertino, and presented the company’s plans to the city.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter \n\"Steve was exhilarated, and inspired, by the California landscape, by its light and its expansiveness. It was his favorite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well,\" Jobs’ widow Laurene Powell Jobs said in a statement. \"He would have flourished, as the people of Apple surely will, on this luminously designed campus.\"\nApple Park’s most notable feature is its ring-shaped, 2.8-million-square-foot main building that has heretofore been known as the “Spaceship.” The building features the world’s largest panels of curved glass and features an area in the center with landscaping and places for employees to congregate. It’s entirely powered by renewable energy supplied by solar panels and other technologies--as is the entire campus.\nOverall, Apple Park spans 175 acres and includes everything from two miles of walking and running paths to an orchard, meadow, and pond. When complete, Apple Park will have more than 9,000 trees.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone, watch: \nIn addition to the ring building, Apple Park has a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, research and development facilities, and several cafes and restaurants.\nApple Park’s auditorium, a place where the company will make big product announcements and hold internal events, will be known as the Steve Jobs Theater. When it opens later this year, the cylindrical facility will seat 1,000 people.\nApple has yet to say when it might hold its first press event at Apple Park, but it’s possible the company could hold at least one product unveiling at the Steve Jobs Theater sometime this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:32:55.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
