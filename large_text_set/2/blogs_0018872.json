He said the country was “probably the only place where entrepreneurial energy is able to scale up, not just start.” Mr. Nadella said that around 2,000 Indian tech entrepreneurs have signed up to use the company’s cloud-based computing tools in the last 12 months. The number is set to grow, he said, as more and more Indians leverage its tools to tap into the country’s market and attract local and foreign investment. Sanjit Das for The Wall Street Journal 2 India’s biometric data presents ‘very exciting’ opportunities \nMr. Nadella commended India’s efforts to allow app developers to use its biometric database of more than a billion citizens as part of an initiative called “ India Stack .” \nHe said that the move to recognize data as the “new natural resource” could help empower every Indian citizen to use their own information to access a variety of services via technology, from banking to public health. “To have that presence-less, cashless, paperless vision on which an entire ecosystem can be built is just super super rich and very very exciting,” he said in a conversation with Nandan Nilekani, the billionaire founder of tech firm Infosys Ltd. and the original chairman of India’s biometric Aadhar program. \nIndranil Mukherjee/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images 3 Indians should be able to access Windows using Aadhar IDs \nMr. Nadella said that the Washington-based giant would like to use the world’s largest biometric database to help Indians sign on to Windows and use its cloud-based office tools, among other products. “I should be able to use any of our applications using the identity system that every Indian uses,” he said. The company also plans to help Indian businesses use its “security enclave” and “core infrastructure” to build for the India Stack. European Pressphoto Agency 4 Microsoft tools are helping Indian schools monitor dropouts \nMr. Nadella hailed his company’s strides in the world of artificial intelligence. “We now have the capability to do human-level speech recognition,” he said. The company’s machine-learning tools were used by the government of India’s south eastern state of Andhra Pradesh to detect high school dropout rates, he said. “Now, it’s spreading to Jharkhand and Punjab.” Agence France-Presse/Getty Images 5 Microsoft is teaming up with Flipkart \nMr. Nadella said Monday that Indian ecommerce firm Flipkart will start to use Microsoft’s cloud-based computing platform Azure. That is in addition to the artificial intelligence, machine learning and speech recognition tools it plans to use to help optimize customer experience and speed-up deliveries, Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal said Monday.
