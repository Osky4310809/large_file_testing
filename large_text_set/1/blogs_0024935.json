Post to Facebook Take a tour of TV's small towns, from Twin Peaks to Riverdale Which of TV's small towns are the Mayberry, N.C., and Cicely, Alaska, of today?  //usat.ly/2jFQFvZ   1 To   Take a tour of TV's small towns, from Twin Peaks to Riverdale Jayme Deerwester , USA TODAY Published 2:58 p.m. ET Jan. 27, 2017 | Updated 2 hours ago Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse) and Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) drop in at the local diner on CW's 'Riverdale.' (Photo: CW) 52 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTV has taken us to some memorable make-believe burgs over the decades: There's Mayberry, N.C. ( The Andy Grriffith Show ); Cabot Cove, Maine ( Murder She Wrote ); Cicely, Alaska ( Northern Exposure ); and Pawnee, Ind. ( Parks and Recreation ). USA TODAY hits some newer spots on the TV map of the USA, starting with the newest: CW's Riverdale (Thursdays, 9 ET/PT). Riverdale (CW, Thursdays, 9 ET/PT) \nActual location: Vancouver \nWhere to go and what to do: Pop Tate's Chocklit Shoppe because, apparently, if you're a character in a small town on TV, you eat the majority of your meals at the local diner or malt shop. And once you have a full belly, you can catch a set by Josie and the Pussycats or go looking for former teen stars including Luke Perry and Molly Ringwald. . \nQuirky neighbors: Jughead ( The Suite Life of Zack & Cody 's Cole Spouse) has gotten an emo makeover and traded the comic-book character's crown for a pointed knit beanie. Riverdale also has its very own Mary Kay Letourneau: music teacher Mrs. Grundy, who has an affair with Archie (KJ Apa). \nCrossover alert: Keep your eyes peeled for actors from other shows on this list ( Stranger Things ' Shannon Purser and Mädchen Amick, who passed through both Twin Peaks and Gilmore Girls .) Twin Peaks, Wash. ( Twin Peaks , Showtime, premiering May 21) \nThe coffee is still damn fine at 'Twin Peaks' Double R Diner, as is the cherry pie. (Photo: Showtime) \nActual location: Spread across the towns of Snoqualmie, North Bend and Fall City, Wash. \nWhere to go and what to do: You can actually get that damn fine cup of coffee and a slice of cherry pie at Twede's Cafe, which stood in for the Double R Diner, and you can bed down at Snoqualmie’s Salish Lodge & Spa, which was called the Great Northern Hotel on the show. It’s where FBI agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) bunked while in town to investigate the death of Laura Palmer. Quirky neighbors: Inhabiting spirit Mike (Al Strobel), who cut off his own arm to rid himself of a tattoo; “Log Lady” Margaret Lanterman (the late Catherine E. Coulson), who shared a psychic connection with the piece of wood she liked to carry around. Hawkins, Ind. ( Stranger Things , Netflix) \nLet's ride: Caleb McLaughlin, left, Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, and Noah Schnapp in Netflix's'Stranger Things.' (Photo: Curtis Baker, Netflix) \nActual location: Jackson, Ga., about an hour south of Atlanta \nWhere to go and what to do: Just escaped being experimented on at the nefarious Hawkins National Laboratory and feeling hungry? Grab a bite at Benny’s Burgers — they’ll feed you even if you show up in a hospital gown. And if you're worried your kids aren't getting enough exercise, send them off with the local children on an unsupervised nightly bike ride. \nQuirky neighbors: You don't get much quirkier than Eleven (breakout star Millie Bobby Brown), a preteen girl with a buzzcut and psychokinetic powers developed at the local government lab. And in Season 2, Hawkins will get its very own conspiracy theorist (Brett Gelman, who also appears in Twin Peaks ). Stars Hollow, Conn. ( Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , Netflix) \nLorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) contemplate their quirky Connecticut town in Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.' (Photo: Saeed Adyani/Netflix) \nActual location: The Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, Calif., though it was inspired by Essex and Wallingford, Conn. \nWhere to go and what to do: Chow at Luke’s Diner (the coffee and pancakes are great, but don’t expect the owner to give you the real wifi password). Or take in an old movie at the Black, White and Read Bookshop and Theater, where you're free to eat outside food. \nQuirky neighbors: Kirk Gleason (Sean Gunn), an odd man who's held every odd job in town; Taylor Doose (Michael Winters), the fussy local market owner who uses town meetings to air his personal grievances, organizes its various festivals and tries to keep Stars Hollow stuck in the 1950s. 52 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jFQFvZ NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
