By: FE Online | Updated: February 23, 2017 4:55 PM The announcement came soon after the results of Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti results came out. (Source: ANI) \nMaharashtra Women and Child Welfare Minister Pankaja Munde today has offered her resignation as a minister. Talking to ANI, Munde said, “I take the responsibility of the defeat of the party at 8 out of the 10 seats in Parli.” The announcement came soon after the results of Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti results came out. Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) was defeated in Parli in Beed district Zilla Parishad polls. In Parli, which is the home region of Munde, opposition Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) won 6 seats out of the 10, giving a strong setback to the ruling BJP government. Despite an exceptional performance in civic poll results across the state, the saffron party had faced a strong defeat in Parli region. \nVote counting for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and nine other municipal corporations along with 25 zilla parishads (district councils) in Maharashtra kicked off at 10am today. As predicted Shiv Sena managed to keep a big lead followed by the BJP. Other parties including NCP, MNS etc. were far behind in the race. The civil polls is also being seen as a direct clash between the National Democratic Alliance partners Shiv Sena and the BJP. With highest voter turnout in Mumbai civil polls so far, with 36 of the 227 civic wards witnessing more than 60 per cent polling, the contest became interesting and too close to call. As many as, 5,097,565 voters took part in the polling out of the total electoral college of 9,180,491 registered voters. \nYou might also want to see this: \nThe civic polls, especially in the country’s financial hub Mumbai, have generated much political heat on account of the fierce fight between the BJP and the Sena, despite they sharing power in the state and at the Centre. The battle of the estranged allies has put a question mark on the stability of the BJP-led ministry in the state as the Sena had been tenacious in its attack on the senior partner and the Centre’s demonetisation policy.
