(Photo: Joe Scarnici, Getty Images for Refinery29) \nKesha has dealt with her fair share of online harassment, and now she's sharing her coping strategies. \nThe singer, who is in the middle of a court battle with her former producer, Dr. Luke , whom she accused of sexual assault before courts denied her request to be released from her contract — participated in an anti-bullying workshop at the South By Southwest festival Tuesday, alongside 20 teens who discussed their experiences with bullying and harassment. And in an interview with Refinery 29 , who co-hosted the panel, she talked about someone she considers one of the biggest trolls around: President Trump. \n\"I think he is the commander-in-chief of the trolls,\" the singer said of Trump. \"Our president is supposed to represent our entire country. Under Obama, I was proud that we had an intelligent, distinguished, and kind man speaking on our behalf; under Trump we have someone who uses divisive, cruel, and sometimes racist rhetoric while speaking as the leader of the United States.\" \n\"When people, and especially kids, see the president acting so negatively towards others, I think that it can cause them to justify similar behavior in their own lives — and that’s not okay,\" she continued. \"We need a leader who promotes unity and acceptance, who treats others how they themselves would want to be treated. It’s sad to me that our president refuses to do that. The silver lining to me is I have seen millions of Americans come together against Trump in the name of acceptance and unity to fight against his bullying behavior.\" \nAt the panel itself, Kesha spoke more about her own personal experiences with trolls and bullying. \n“I’ve dealt with mental illness in my life,” the singer said, via People . “People should know that a single online comment has sent me into a depression spiral.” Her best tactic towards dealing with the negativity and abuse online is to simply unplug from it. \n“The internet is not a healthy place for me. I limit myself on reading comments,\" she said. \"There may have been so many positive ones but I always gravitate towards reading the negative ones. I realized I was making trolls and bullies the truth, making them my higher power. I have become a woman in a lot of ways, reclaiming my personal space, my body, my confidence.” \nShe added, “I am happiest when I am present in my real life. Not when in my online life.\" \nKesha also addressed her eating disorder . She recently recorded a PSA on the subject for NEDA (National Eating Disorders Awareness). \n“People don’t want to talk about eating disorders … and I just want people to know that they are not alone. It is not your fault and it is not a weakness,\" she said. \"It is a disease. I used to be embarrassed to talk about it, but now I want to talk about it. It can kill you, I almost died.” \nKesha explained that she has a healthier body image now. \n“I ditched the idea of what my image should or should not be at this point. I have let go of trying to control things,\" she said. \"And the new music is just me speaking honestly about my life for the first time ever without anyone dictating anything. Me speaking truthfully from my guts.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2nnbth9 Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T17:14:29.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
