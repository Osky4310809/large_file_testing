In Barcelona he did well, and today too. \n\"Of the three goals, his is possibly the most spectacular. It is always important for the strikers to score. As for Gameiro; the knock down for Griezmann's goal was key, and he hit the crossbar. \n\"He has to be calm. We love him and he will give us many joys.\" \nThe Calderon crowd was nowhere near full capacity for the visit of Celta, though Simeone was understanding and even praised those who were there for pushing Atletico over the line at the end. \n\"It was a difficult day; very cold, at night, Sunday, tomorrow people are at work again,\" he said. \nWhen are the CL last 16 games? \n\"But the fans were key in the final stages. At other times the fans might have been irritated, but on the contrary. \n\"The last ten minutes was the best part of the game for the team and we scored two goals in ten minutes.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:28:56.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
