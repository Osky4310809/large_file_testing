An accompanying app to enhance the experience is being developed for Android and iOS as well. The system can be used to learn notes, chords, scales and strum patterns. Creators Brandon Borko and Shaun Masavage developed this system to make “make guitar learning and playing more intuitive and easier”. Borko and Masavage are currently raising funds through Kickstarter in order to bring Fret Zeppelin to market\nNow you can play songs intuitively, not just one note or chord at a time. Fret Zeppelin helps you to play through entire songs on the FIRST try! After you play a note, our app detects the sound and lights up where you put your fingers next. …The craft of guitar design and acoustics has been perfected for decades. Others before us have made guitars with LEDs built-in and the feedback is always the same: the guitars sound terrible. That’s why we leave the guitars to the experts and created a product you can easily add to the guitar of your choosing. \nCheck out how #FretZeppelin fits above the frets of any standard guitar to help you play any note, chord, or song: https://t.co/Ijj3fGs75s \n— Fret Zeppelin (@FretZeppelin) January 10, 2017 \n\n\nA photo posted by Fret Zeppelin (@fretzeppelin) on Dec 24, 2016 at 2:26am PST \n\nA photo posted by Fret Zeppelin (@fretzeppelin) on Dec 5, 2016 at 9:14am PST \n\nA video posted by Fret Zeppelin (@fretzeppelin) on Jan 14, 2017 at 7:55am PST \n\n\n\nvia Gadgetify , The Awesomer \nRelated Laughing Squid Posts A Markable Guitar Fretboard Sleeve That Adds a Handy Visual Element to Learning Notes and Chords Electronic Rock Guitar T-Shirt That You Can Actually Play, Comes With a Belt Clip Mini Amp The Jamstik, A Compact Digital Guitar That Pairs With a Smartphone App for Interactive Learning ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:31:46.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
