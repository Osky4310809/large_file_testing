Photo: ALEX BRANDON \nSeriously though: Kanye West. Think about it. A shameless self-promoter who would perform at the opening of a wound. If you can't book him, you can't book anyone. And that looks to be more or less what they did. \nAt the Liberty and Freedom Balls they got Sam Moore, The Piano Guys, Lexi Walker, Cache Olson and Erin Boheme. Think about it this way: if you have to Google them to find out who they are, it's a safe bet they're not famous in any traditional sense of the word. \nUp the street at the Salute to Our Armed Services they got Tony Orlando and Josh Weathers. \nTony Orlando, assuming you're not old enough to remember him, is a 74-year-old singer best known for the 1970s-era pop duo Tony Orlando and Dawn; Josh Weathers is singer-songwriter from Fort Worth, Texas. \nThe most famous act on stage all night was arguably Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance . And even they, it might be said, are no longer at the centre of the cultural zeitgeist. \nAccentuating what was already a deeply mediocre mood, it came with an accompanying television commentary. \nImagine watching the Logies, with a commentary box, and you're halfway to the horror of it all. Throw in Anderson Cooper trying to tack between social stimulus plans and the colour of Melania Trump's dress with a straight face and you're there. \nTelevision coverage means that you soon lose track of which ball you're actually looking at, but it's fair to say that they all looked more or less the same. \nYou couldn't also help wondering if the folks at the unofficial balls - including the Pink Ball at the Carol Whitehill Moses Centre and the 1920s-themed The Great Gatsby Presidential Inaugural Ball at the National Portrait Gallery - weren't having a much better time. \nIt all came to a thrilling climax with the much-discussed \"first dance\", featuring Donald and Melania. Immediate takeaway: he might have all the money in the world but the man can't dance to save himself. \nThey were joined soon by Mike Pence and his wife, and then all the Trump offspring and their spouses. Soon after, it started looking less like Make America's Got Talent Great Again and more like Dancing With The Stars . One where no one actually knows how to dance. \nAnd then there was the choice of song: Frank Sinatra's My Way . \nSetting aside a minor media kerfuffle about whether Nancy Sinatra approved of the song's use or not, did no one vet the lyrics? The final curtain? There were times ... when I bit off more than I could chew? I've had my fill, my share of losing? \nEven Sinatra herself wondered publicly. \"Just remember the first line of the song,\" she warned. \nAnd now, the end is near ...
