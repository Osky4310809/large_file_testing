Our alliance is a testament to mutual commitment and respect and it is a linchpin of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\" he declared.\n\"...North Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons program and engage in threatening rhetoric and behavior. We stand with our peace-loving Republic of Korea ally to maintain stability on the peninsula and in the region. America's commitments to defending our allies and to upholding our extended deterrence guarantees remain ironclad. Any attack on the United States or on our allies will be defeated and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with the response that would be effective and overwhelming.\"\nMattis emphasized steps being taken \"due to North Korea's threatening rhetoric and destabilizing behavior\" such as \"deploying the highly effective THAAD antimissile unit to the Republic of Korea, to protect its people and our troops that stand beside our ally.\"\n\"We are also committed to expanding trilateral venues of cooperation with Japan where the mutual defense of our nations is best served through teamwork,\" he added.\nHan said he and Mattis were \"able to form a close relationship in such a short period of time.\"\n politics/2017/02/03/mattis-reinforces-strong-mutual-defense-commitment-in-japan-south-korea/\nload more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:44:13.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
