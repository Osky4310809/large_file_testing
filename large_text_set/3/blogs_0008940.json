What do you [the reporter] prefer, why? — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadriden) March 11, 2017 \n\"I think Gareth offers more up front with Benzema and Ronaldo. Gareth on the left, Ronaldo on the right and Karim Benzema up front – that's how I like to see my front three. \n\"With the three up front we create a lot of chances, with three [midfield] players tucked in behind. \nMadrid team news & line-up vs Betis \n\"We played very well in Eibar [last weekend's 4-1 win] with a 4-2-3-1 formation, or 4-4-2. \n\"It depends. With one up front, two up front or four in the middle we can change our formation and switch. Everyone has a right to have their own opinion. \n\"You may feel we play better with four men across the middle. \n\"If all three [Benzema, Bale and Ronaldo] are fit I have all three playing up front.\" \nWhen is the Champions League draw? \nDespite Zidane mixing up his tactical approach over recent months, he has still been reluctant to deploy playmakers Isco and James Rodriguez in tandem. \nSpain international Isco was linked with a move to Manchester City this week, but his coach would not rule out a future for both players at the Bernabeu. — ريال مدريد (@realmadridarab) March 11, 2017 \nHe said: \"I'm not going to talk about next season. Yes, they are compatible because they are two excellent footballers, so of course they can play together.\" \nInjury plagued full-back Fabio Coentrao will not feature once more against Betis, with Zidane reporting a niggle, although Morata is over an injury scare suffered during training. \n\"It was a knock, a blow – he'll be in the squad. Nothing serious, he'll be with us on Sunday,\" Zidane explained.
