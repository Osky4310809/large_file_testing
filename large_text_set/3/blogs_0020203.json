It does not appear to be too bad based on the information Chelsea gave us. Eden came to Belgium on Monday, but he will not remain with the group. \n\"Of course, this will be a disappointment for him. He is a very professional captain. But injuries are part of the game. A big test awaits without Eden.\" \nBelgium top Group H with 12 points from four games, two points clear of Greece.
