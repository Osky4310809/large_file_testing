Republican voters are becoming more sceptical about free-trade, paving the way for tariffs.\nHere is the chart:\nGoldman Sachs\nDespite this, the Trump administration is unlikely to go straight to blanket tariffs. \"Our expectation is that near-term activity is likely to be limited to targeted actions, with blanket tariffs held out as an additional tool that might be used later,\" the analysts said.\nThat 45% tariff plan won't go down well among Chinese policymakers. In an interview with Goldman Sachs, Chinese trade expert Tu Xinqan, said it would start a full-blown trade-war almost instantly.\n\"Of course, if a 45% tariff were imposed, it would trigger a trade war. China would definitely retaliate and would likely go above and beyond the US measures, potentially imposing tariffs as high as 80- 90% on imports from the US,\" he said.\n\"That said, an across-the-board tariff of any size on US imports from China would be significant—certainly much more so than anti-dumping or countervailing duties on only specific products—and would require that China respond. China would not tolerate even 1% more in tariffs than what is imposed on other countries.\"\nTensions are already building between China and the US on trade, and tariffs are rising.\nEarlier this year China increased anti-dumping tariffs on US imports of grains used in animal feed from 33.8% to as much as 53.7%. The country also hiked anti-subsidy penalties from 10% to as much as 12%, according to a Reuters report.\nIt is bad news for stability, and good lead to worse outcomes than higher prices for some goods.\nChinese tech billionaire Jack Ma made headlines last month for visiting Donald Trump and announcing his company Alibaba would help create 1 million jobs for the US.\nIn January in Australia, he warned in no uncertain terms that a retreat from globalisation would result only in trouble.\n\"If trade stops, war starts,\" Ma said while in Melbourne to launch Alibaba's Australia and New Zealand headquarters .\nNOW WATCH: The wealth of these 8 men equals the bottom 50% of the entire world Trade Goldman Sachs U.S. China Donald J.
