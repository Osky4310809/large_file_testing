That has now been taken up, tying him to Old Trafford until at least the summer of 2018. \nThe midfielder is much valued by manager Jose Mourinho and scored his first goal of the season during the 2-0 win against Hull City in Tuesday's EFL Cup semi-final first leg at Old Trafford, nudging the Reds closer to a place in next month's final at Wembley Stadium. \nThe 29-year-old has already lifted the FA Cup with United after starting last May's final against Crystal Palace, having previously scored in the semi-final victory over former club Everton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T14:02:02.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
