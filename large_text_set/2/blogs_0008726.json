What could it look like? \n“New security measures.” \nOK then. \n—Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) February 10, 2017 \nWhile it’s unclear what, specifically, Trump’s forthcoming order would entail, NBC News reported on Friday that administration officials are working on revising the current Muslim ban to withstand future legal challenges. \nNews of Trump’s potential executive action comes as the White House announced to Fox News reporter John Roberts that it would not appeal the Ninth Circuit’s ruling to the Supreme Court, as had been widely expected. WhiteHouse confirms to @johnrobertsFox that WH not likely to appeal to 9th dist court decision, nor likely file an emergency SCOTUS appeal. \nRather, Fox News’ Fin Gomez reported, the White House would “ fight it out in US district court in Seattle on the merits of executive order .” \nIt appears, then, that the Trump administration is planning for several contingencies—one in which its existing Muslim ban is maintained, pending the current, ongoing legal actions against it, and one in which subsequent, more legally palatable executive orders are necessary.
