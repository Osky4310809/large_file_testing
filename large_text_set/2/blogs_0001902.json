If [head coach] Sinisa Mihajlovic sees him as the Serbian Donnarumma, he may opt to focus on him as a starter. \n\"Nothing is decided with Joe Hart, though. We will discuss it with him and the club and see what the conditions are. Nothing is defined from this point of view.\" \nChelsea, Liverpool and West Ham have been among the teams linked with a move for Hart.
