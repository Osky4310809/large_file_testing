Our writers answer some of the most common queries ‘Whoever said trees and stars were supposed to enjoy themselves?’ Photograph: Alamy Wednesday 18 January 2017 08.00 GMT Last modified on Wednesday 18 January 2017 08.02 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nI ’d like to begin by shelving the obvious, contemporary answer to the question “Why don’t I enjoy life?”: “Because you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, which can be fixed with medication.” I wouldn’t want to put anyone off doing anything that might help their suffering, but this answer needs to stop being so pushy and get to the back of the queue: there are plenty of perfectly valid reasons for not enjoying life. How would the Stoics cope today? | Ryan Holiday Read more \nThe curious thing about this question is that it’s asked in the negative. “Why do I enjoy life?” could be considered equally perplexing. The use of the negative seems to suggest that enjoyment is the norm and non-enjoyment a deviation. But is life really meant to be fun? Or is it far too intrinsically difficult? Some schools of thought, such as stoicism , might advise you to stop even trying to have a great time. Others, like hedonism, take enjoyment to be the main aim. \nWhile old-fashioned stoics may look a bit sour-faced and grumpy to people who’ve grown up with Coca-Cola ads, it doesn’t take much of a psychic somersault to come to the conclusion that perky, neoliberal pleasure-seeking can also be a downer. \nHow enjoyable is life supposed to be? Perhaps it would be wise to ask what “life” is. Do we mean the series of events that begins with birth and ends with death and gets all fiddly in the middle? Or is it more helpful to go back to the earliest specks of living matter? There’s something mind-bogglingly strange and exciting about the very improbability of it all. Why did those little ignitions keep happening? And why did they start to happen more and more, lasting for longer and adding bits on? Did the cells somehow “like” what they were experiencing, and to try to cling on to it? Is “life” in the primeval sense a pleasure or a pain? ‘Guzzle your medicine and stop whining’ does not necessarily deal with the incredible weirdness of life on this planet.’ Photograph: Jonathan Nourok/Getty Images \nThe pre- Socratic philosophers are nice people to think about because they are like us in that they were talkative, self-aware humans, but unlike us in that they didn’t have access to detailed empirical information about primordial fossil formations and brain chemistry. They had to answer questions about existence based on what they saw in front of them. Unlike people in most other cultures and at most other moments in history, they chose not to turn to supernatural explanations but to try to understand the world in physical terms. \nOne of the nicest, and maddest, of all pre-Socratics was Empedocles , who thought that the world was composed of four “roots” – earth, air, fire and water – that were constantly being formed and reformed according to the universal principles of Love and Strife. While it might sound a bit naive and wacky, it’s also not completely off the mark. \nEmpedocles is credited with presaging quantum physics, with its notion of particles affected by the forces of attraction and repulsion. (Although even the ancient physicists could see that, in a lot of ways, he was wrong. Not to mention actually quite religious.) \nHe was also one of the last philosophers to put down his ideas in verse, and overall his vision of the cosmos is fantastically poetic: once upon a time there was just a big ball of emulsified Love, which then became fractured by Strife. The reason we aren’t just soup is that the “roots” attracted and repelled each other to produce the complex world we now live in. In other words, something like big bang theory . The end point of all this Strife was a strictly layered world in which all the elements were fully separated out. (Perhaps we will get there some time in the next four years.) Still, it’s OK because once the roots are separated, Love comes along and starts mixing things up again. ‘Now we are told that ‘experiences’ are the aim of the discerning consumer. Be existentially smart and go zorbing. This will surely placate your troubled soul.’ Photograph: Alamy \nExplanations like this might not have the laboratory-tested and easily actionable appeal of the “take Prozac” answer, but they do at least have something thoughtful to say about the incredible weirdness of life on this planet. Something better than: “Guzzle your medicine and stop whining.” \nNeoliberalism is naughty in that it pretends not to be a cunning scheme but an extension of the natural way of things. Likewise, biological explanations for unhappiness. Both might initially appear non-ideological, simple extensions or descriptions of the way things are. However, the underlying implication of so many diagnoses of depression is that you should be happy because you live in a culture in which everything is allowed and possible. Therefore, if you’re unhappy, there must be something wrong with you. This is an extremely cruel proposition, made worse by the fact that our sneaky culture offers any number of purchasable objects that promise to uplift us. \nIn other words, contemporary capitalism breeds dissatisfaction, then tries to sell us a bogus antidote – and when that doesn’t work, it drugs us. To add insult to injury, now most of us have worked out that unnecessary material goods don’t generally make that much difference to our overall happiness, we are told that “experiences” are the aim of the discerning consumer . Don’t be an idiot and spend all your money in Topshop or John Lewis, be existentially smart and eat jellied fish skin in a hot air balloon/pretend to be Sherlock Holmes for a night/go zorbing . This will surely placate your troubled soul. \nRather than accepting the terms of our current state of Love and Strife, it may be better to think back to the prehistoric swamps and wonder what on earth those feisty protozoa were getting out of it, and also to remember the words of that lovely, hokey bathroom-wall poem Desiderata : You are a child of the universe,/ no less than the trees and the stars . And whoever said trees and stars were supposed to enjoy themselves?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T10:51:47.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
