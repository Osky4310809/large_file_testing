So, the Italian world traveler took matters into her own hands by completely restoring a 2001 Renault Kangoo Van into the lovingly named Pam the Van , a roaming tiny home on wheels, fully equipped to take her and beloved furry fido on plenty of worldly adventures.\n\n\nPiro's adventures started early in life when she realized she wanted to be a “self sufficient forest fairy.” Her second goal? To travel the world with Odie. So the Italian-born traveler mixed her two goals and bought the 15-year-old van in order to convert it (completely on her own) into a compact, but comfy home on wheels .\nRelated: Traveling family renovates old school bus as both solar-powered home and hostel \n\nPiro's first step in the renovation process was to completely gut the old vehicle from top to bottom. She then began to create her living quarters by replacing the floor and building a kitchenette and her bed. For lighting, she installed LED lights . After adding a few homey touches like curtains and house plants, the old van was reborn as Pam the Van.\n\nAlthough she is enjoying her nomadic lifestyle , she does admit that van life with a dog has its disadvantages, including restrictions on her own freedom, inability to leave Odie \"at home\", and the overall messiness that comes with living in close quarters with a furry dog.\nShe explains that, “Despite being the most practical solution, van life with a dog can be difficult at times and you must consider various aspects of it before throwing yourself into it.” Despite the drawbacks, she and Odie are loving their adventures, which she posts on her Instagram account.\n+ Pam the Van \nVia My Modern Met \nImages via Pam the Van \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T15:20:10.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
