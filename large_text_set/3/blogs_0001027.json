The bench which is being led by the Chief Justice of India, JS Khehar told the activist that if something concerns the following parties they will either approach the court or hire him as a counsel. \nWith strong words the bench reprimanded Bhushan and told him that he is a private person who doesn’t have the authority to question. The bench said, ‘ You are a private person who has no authority to ask question. Whenever there is something substantial, we will pass directions. You point out if a serious fraud has been committed.’ \nYou may also like to watch: \nThe bench also consisting of DY Chandrachud and SK Kaul was hearing another PIL which had been filed by NGO Humanity Salt Lake. The mentioned NGO had sought an investigation into the banned chit fund scheme, according to Indian Express reports. SEBI, the regulator for securities market in India had earlier informed the court that it has already referred to concerned agencies for further investigation of over 1500 ponzi scheme since inspecting the matter was not under their jurisdiction. \nFollowing the the submission of the report by SEBI, the bench came to the conclusion that nothing more was left to be heard in the PIL since the cases were already being investigated. The bench was displeased with Bhushan following his statement were he alleged that the approach of disposing the matter will render the jurisdiction of PILs ‘ meaningless’ which has been devised to help the poor. \n‘ The investigations have already been transferred to other agencies which are beyond the jurisdiction of SEBI. These are responsible agencies. What else do you want, ‘ the bench asked Bhushan according to Indian Express reports. \nDeclining Prashant Bhushan’s request of keeping the case pending, the bench decided to dispose it without further ado.
