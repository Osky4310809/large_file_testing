I wonder if the Gov’t agency only know how to collect revenue without doing anything. Visit Ajah and you Will be met with blocked drainage and road. And no one is being punished for all these. chime \nHis Excellency started well & i still believe he meant well for Lagos but politics has really slowed him down badly to the chagrin of the public.I wonder what his ministry of works people are doing with the supervision of road construction works going on at Ayobo/Ipaja. Apart from shoddy job on the project, this project has remained uncompleted for too long. Now the rains has stoppped, no contactors on the roads, when the rains starts again, they tell us that the work was being delayed because of the rains.His Excellency, please help us at Ipaja /Ayobo before the next rains, Eko ni baje o! Onyeka Chris \nLagos traffic is the singular major factor militating its development to a world-class city. I say this bc it has all the inclinings of world-class status in terms of the activities therein. The traffic situation has also given it a turndown in most quarters. Something drastic needs to be done ! \nPersonally, I’m surprised the situation has stagnated or even worsened under this popularly amiable Fashola regime. The expectations were high, and he seemingly met some initially. Don’t know what is happening now. Ashoxy \nThere has to be traffic mayhem in Lagos because of the following simple reasons;Lagos is densely populated and the only major means off transportation automobiles. Also, the BRT in my own opinion has added to the traffic predicament because of the dedicated lanes.Imagine a serious traffic situation in which only one lane is empty and is forbidden otherwise you face the music.Its either the BRT should replace the Yellow buses or no BRT for now because if you are adding more vehicles to the over bloated number already on the road,you are increasing the traffic density.Moreover, some roads have some bad sections, such as railway junctions,potholes etc.These are stoppers,when you have a lot of traffic,they cause untold delays. abduljelil \nMr barnabas, you shouldn’t be surprised seeing pot holes in the newly constructed or rehabilitated roads in the rural areas across lagos..what i think you should be surprised at is the comparative difference between the state of roads constructed in high brow areas and rural areas…the governor himself would never waste his time designing or proposing a better for the rural settings bcos his regime and himself his for the rich and well to do individuals…haven’t you wondered why since 2008 that the mega road proposed for construction between mile2 through badagry to other ECOWAS state hasnt reached 30% progress, even though MOU was signed by Lagos govt and ECOWAS/UBA….govt for themselves and families… GBenga \nI need to add my opinion to this road issue by saying that the governor should seek residents feedback from each zone to know their feelings. I think your commissioners and civil servants are not telling the true state of traffic in Lagos state. I will want to know what happened to the proposed alternate roads for Lekki-Epe expressway? And what’s the plan for opening up feeder roads in Lekki, Ikota, Ajah….down to Ibeju? It will be disgraceful and insulting to our intelligence for anyone in this MEGA CITY to tell us that the 3km snaky road around Chevron drive is alternate road or the other one by Oniru estate. However, I need to appreciate the leadership example of our able governor in his performance, but we are not there yet; agreed we have left Egypt, but we are not in the promised land. ibraheem \nJoin the discussion…I am in Cairo city of Egypt as we speak , and can read news about traffic from ikorodu to oshodi. Passengers are paying 500 naira. Sir, what are u really doing. Your officers are claiming to be worthless. There are pregnant women, nursing mothers, sick patients to mention but few in that stinky traffic. Do something sir.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:07:14.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
