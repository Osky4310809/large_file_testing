And who can blame them?” Morneau said.\nAfter setting up the doom and the gloom, Morneau spoke of the good news: Canadians have always been able to adapt to changing circumstances.\nEveryday folks who work hard to provide for their families are worried about the future\nThe budget, which projects a deficit of $28.6 billion this coming fiscal year, including a contingency reserve, is designed to help them get there.\nIt includes about $5.2 billion for skills development as the government plans to help Canadians adapt their education and employment training to a diversifying economy at a time when the lower price of oil has meant the natural resource sector can no longer be counted on to provide jobs — or sustain federal revenues.\nMeasures include letting out-of-work Canadians go back to school or receive new job training without having to give up their employment insurance benefits, a pilot project to test ways to make it easier for adults who have already been in the workforce to access student loans and grants and doing more to promote careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics to young people.\nThe Liberals do not just want to help Canadians find jobs in the future. They also want to try and bring that future about.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hold copies of the federal budget in the House of Commons in Ottawa, Wednesday, March 22, 2017. The budget commits nearly $3 billion to support innovation over the next five years and promises to develop an innovation and skills plan that will target six sectors the Liberal government see as good bets for spurring economic growth and creating well-paying jobs: advanced manufacturing, clean technology, the agri-food sector, digital industries, clean resources and health and bio-sciences.\nAs the Liberals work to ensure everyone can find a job in the new economy, they are also giving a boost to many who were left behind by the traditional one, such as women and those from indigenous communities.\nThe budget commits $7 billion over the next decade to help increase access to affordable child care, will allow women to begin maternity leave earlier and provides more financial support for those caring for an ill or aging relative — all seen as ways to help increase the participation of women in the workforce.\nThe budget document, for the first time in Canadian history, also includes a section on how many of its measures impact men and women in different ways, with a promise to do a deeper gender-based analysis for the 2018 budget.\nWhile this budget is relatively thin on net new spending, all these new promises still come with a cost, especially since the federal government is still footing the bill for the gigantic, ongoing commitments from last year.\nCanadians can expect a five-cent increase in EI premiums in fiscal 2018-19, up to $1.68 per $100 of insurable earnings, with some of that additional cost coming from the measures that will give more people access to benefits.\nThe government is also looking for savings in other ways that will hit the pocketbooks of many Canadians, by eliminating the public transit tax credit, raising the tax on alcohol by two per cent — beginning Thursday — and changing the rules so that ride-sharing businesses, such as Uber, are subject to the same sales taxes as traditional taxis.\nThe deficit still remains nearly three times the $10-billion limit the Liberals promised in their campaign platform and while the budget’s projections show it shrinking over time as the government expects economic growth to pick up steam, there is still no official word on when they expect to get back to balance.\nThis budget also removes a pledge to reduce the ratio of federal debt to GDP over the course of their mandate, which, after busting past their promise to eliminate the deficit by 2019, was the only fiscal target they had left.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:38:35.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
