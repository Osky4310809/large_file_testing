(Photo: Crackle) \nJerry Seinfeld will start getting coffee elsewhere in late 2017. \nThe comedian, whose Emmy-nominated Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee has been available on Crackle streaming service, is moving to Netflix. \nNetflix announced Tuesday that it will be \"the exclusive home for his new comedic endeavors,\" and that it has signed Seinfeld to a deal that includes new episodes of his series as well as two new standup shows. According to Netflix's release, the comedian also will help develop new scripted and unscripted programming for the streaming service. \n“Jerry is known the world over as both a great TV innovator and beloved comic voice,” Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer at Netflix, said. “We are incredibly proud to welcome him to the Netflix comedy family.” \n\"When I first started thinking about Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee , the entire Netflix business model consisted of mailing out DVDs in envelopes. I love that we are now joining together, both at very different points,” said Seinfeld, who produces, directs and hosts the show. “I am really quite charged up to be moving there.\" \nComedians in Cars Getting Coffee , which features Seinfeld joining friends for a cup of coffee and a drive in a classic, will premiere 24 episodes in installments globally on Netflix starting in 2017. More episodes will follow in 2018 and beyond. According to Tuesday's announcement, previous seasons of the series (59 existing episodes) will also become available exclusively on Netflix at the same time.  //usat.ly/2k2khrf  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:18:15.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
