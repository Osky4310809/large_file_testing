John Bercow slammed Trump for \"racism and sexism\", his undermining of judges and his migrant ban. Bercow's intervention is unusual because Speakers are expected to remain above Parliament's partisan fray. \nHe was cheered by lawmakers when he said that, although Britain values its relationship with the U.S., \"our opposition to racism and to sexism, and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary, are hugely important considerations.\" Trump is due to visit Britain later this year. \nAs The Mirror reported , Bercow added that although he does not have as much say over a speech in the glittering Royal Gallery in the House of Lords, \"I would not wish to issue an invitation\". \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: \"Well said John Bercow. We must stand up for our country's values. Trump's State Visit should not go ahead.\" \nIt comes after 163 MPs signed an internal petition demanding Trump be refused the honour due to his migrant ban and comments on torture and women. \nWestminster Hall is where ex-President Barack Obama addressed both houses of Parliament in 2011 and is a venue previously used by Nelson Mandela. \nBarack Obama addressing both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall in 2011 \nSpeaker Bercow said he is one of three \" keyholders\" that would agree to any address in the historic hall. The other two are the Lord Speaker and Lord Great Chamberlain. He told MPs a Westminster Hall address \"is not an automatic right - it is an earned honour.\" \nHe added: \"Ordinarily we are able to work by consensus that the hall would be able to be used for an address by agreement of the the three key holders. Before the imposition of the migrant ban I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump to Westminster Hall. After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump to Westminster Hall.\" \nThe Speaker added: \"We value our relationship with the United States. If a state visit takes place, that is way beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker. \n\"However, as far as this place is concerned I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.\" \nBercow also outlined his opposition to Mr Trump being invited to address MPs and peers in the Royal Gallery, a room often used for state receptions. \nHe said: \"So far as the Royal Gallery is concerned, and again I operate on advice, I do not perhaps have as strong a say in that matter. It is in a different part of the building although customarily an invitation to a visiting leader to deliver an address there would be issued in the names of the two speakers. I would not wish to issue an invitation to President Trump to speak in the Royal Gallery.\" \nAfter his announcement, veteran anti-establishment Labour MP Dennis Skinner bellowed: \"Two words - well done\". Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who started the 'Early Day Motion' signed by 163 MPs, said after the Speaker's comments: \"Our Parliament stands for liberty, equality and independence from government. We choose who we honour. \nAs usual, we look forward to Trump's angry tweet once he learns that he is effectively non-grat a in the British Parliament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T20:30:36.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
