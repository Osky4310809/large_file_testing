And if they’re based more on admiration and less on romance, they’re harmless. We’re loving how actress Kristen Bell admitted having a crush on Keith Morrison, even going so far to describe him as a “silver fox” on The Ellen DeGeneres Show .\nBell, who’s been married to husband Dax Shepard since 2013, held nothing in, while the studio audience gazed upon photos of Morrison. Morrison, a television host, has been a correspondent for Dateline since 1995. Married since 1981, a year after Bell was born, he has six children at home.\nSo, that’s why this crush is pretty comical. We can only imagine that Bell makes sure she watches a lot of Dateline back at home. The reason why she likes him? Well, looks aside, he seems to be pretty daring.\n“He’s the main correspondent on Dateline. Look at him, that silver fox,” Bell said, as images of Morrison were projected behind her. “He’s been one of my favorites forever. Here’s the thing about Keith, he’s famous for leaning on things… Anything! Fire, wind, I’ve legit seen him lean on barbed wire.” We’re impressed. Kristen Bell actually got a chance to chat with him, which was even more nerve-wracking, since she hasn’t kept her crush on Morrison a secret.\nIn fact, Morrison must have mentioned how his wife gave him some “words” before his interview with Bell. \n“She looked at me and said, ‘Hey! You’re nobody’s hall pass.'” We seriously think this is adorable. Morrison is probably incredibly flattered by the crush. We mean, wouldn’t you be?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:03:00.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
