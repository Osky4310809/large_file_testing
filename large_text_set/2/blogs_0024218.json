Baron Reznik (www.reznik.net)/ Getty Images By Sharell Cook Updated February 16, 2017 . \nTravel to Bhutan is expensive and not easily undertaken. However, the rich culture, unspoiled scenery, and fresh mountain air make it very worthwhile. Here's what you need to know about visiting Bhutan. Tours and Independent Travel \nThe Bhutanese government is reserved about allowing visitors into the country. Independent travel to Bhutan is opening up but it's not something the government encourages. Generally, visitors to Bhutan must either be tourists, or guests of the government. The only other options for visiting the country are to receive an invitation by \"a citizen of some standing\" or a volunteer organization. \nWith the exception of passport holders from India, Bangladesh and the Maldives, all tourists must travel on a preplanned, prepaid, guided package tour or custom designed travel program. Getting a Visa \nEveryone traveling to Bhutan requires to obtain a visa in advance, except for passport holders from India, Bangladesh and the Maldives. \ncontinue reading below our video Tips for Taking Better Travel Photos Passport holders from these three countries can obtain a free Entry Permit on arrival, upon producing their passport with a minimum six months validity. Indian nationals can also use their Voters Identity Card. \nFor other passport holders, visas cost $40. The visas must be applied and paid for in advance, from registered tour operators (not embassies), at the same time as booking the rest of your trip. You should try and make your travel arrangements at least 90 days prior to travel to allow time for all the formalities to be completed. \nThe visas are processed through an online system by the tour operators, and are approved by the Tourism Council of Bhutan once full payment of the cost of the trip has been received. Tourists are issued with a visa clearance letter, to be presented at immigration upon arrival at the airport. The visa is then stamped in the passport. Getting There \nThe only international airport in Bhutan is located at Paro. Currently, two airlines operate flights to Bhutan: Drukair and Bhutan Airlines . Departure points include Bangkok (Thailand), Kathmandu (Nepal), New Delhi and Kolkata (India), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Yangoon (Myanmar), and Singapore. \nIt's also possible to travel to Bhutan from India overland by road. The main border crossing is Jaigon-Phuentsholing. There are two others, at Gelephu and Samdrup Jongkhar. Tour Costs \nThe minimum price of tours (called a \"Minimum Daily Package\") to Bhutan is set by the government, to control tourism and protect the environment, and can't be negotiated. The price includes all accommodations, meals, transportation, guides and porters, and cultural programs. Part of it also goes towards free education, free healthcare, and poverty alleviation in Bhutan. \n\"Minimum Daily Package\" prices vary according to the season and number of tourists in the group. \nHigh Season: March, April, May, September, October, and November $250 per person per day, for a group of three or more people. $280 per person per day, for a group of two people. $290 per day for single individuals. \nLow Season: January, February, June, July, August, and December $200 per person per day, for a group of three or more people. $230 per person per day, for a group of two people. $240 per day for single individuals. \nDiscounts are available for children and students. \nDo note that each tour operator has their preferred hotels. These are often the ones that cost less. Therefore, tourists should find out the hotels they've been assigned to, do some research about hotels in Bhutan on Tripadvisor , and ask to switch hotels if not satisfied. Most people assume that they're stuck with a fixed itinerary and the hotels allocated to them. However, tour companies will in fact accommodate requests in order to keep business. Tour Companies \nThe Bhutan Tourist Corporation Limited (BTCL) comes highly recommended for making travel bookings to Bhutan. This company is owned by members of the royal family and advertises itself as Bhutan's number one travel agency since 1991. The drivers, guides, and accommodations provided are excellent.

According to the Bhutan Tourism Monitor , these were the top 10 tour operators in 2015 (based on the number of tourists received/bed nights).
