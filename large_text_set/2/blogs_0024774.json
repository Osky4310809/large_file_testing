Final leaderboard \nHonda Classic \nThe American took a four-shot lead in to Sunday and never lost top spot throughout his final round, carding a one-over 71 to finish four clear of Morgan Hoffmann and Gary Woodland. \nFowler recovered from a slow start to pull clear of the chasing pack in breezy conditions at PGA National, with the world No 14 able to bogey his final two holes and still secure a convincing victory. Tyrrell Hatton (L) was paired with Fowler for the final round \nHe extended his overnight advantage to five strokes with a 10-foot birdie at the third, but bogeyed the next after his putt from off the green landed in a sprinkler head. \nWoodland birdied two of his opening three holes to move in to the share of second, as Fowler found water off the sixth tee on his way to a double-bogey. Woodland posted a one-under 69 on Sunday \nWith his lead down to two, Fowler hit out from the trees at the eighth and drained a 30-foot birdie but then missed a 10-footer to save par at the next. \nAs Woodland birdied the 11th and 13th to briefly move within one of the lead, Fowler holed a 35-footer at the 12th and sank another long-range putt at the next to restore a three-shot cushion.

No contract. \nWoodland saw his hopes ended with a three-putt bogey at the 17th, as Fowler birdied the 16th but bogeyed the next after sending his tee shot in to the hazard. \nFowler then missed out on equalling the 72-hole tournament record with another dropped shot at the last, finishing a cautious two-putt bogey from 25 feet to complete a fourth PGA Tour victory. Fowler's last PGA Tour win came in September 2015 \nMorgan Hoffman produced a bogey-free back nine to grab a share of second alongside Woodland, who sent his approach in to the hazard on his way to a final-hole blemish. \nTyrrell Hatton missed a five-footer at the 17th and left another birdie chance at the last just short, with a two-over 72 leaving the Englishman five off the champion. Hatton bogeyed three of his opening six holes \nAmerican trio Billy Horschel, Chad Collins and Wesley Brian and Germany's Martin Kaymer joined Hatton in tied-fourth, with Graham DaLaet completing the top 10. \nA hat-trick of bogeys after the turn saw Sergio Garcia end the week on four under, with Jimmy Walker a further shot back after carding a triple-bogey and double-bogey through the infamous Bear Trap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:57:15.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
