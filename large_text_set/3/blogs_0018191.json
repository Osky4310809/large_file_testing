That's because these retirement plans are going the way of the dinosaur, replaced by the defined contribution plan , typically a 401(k) account. (See also: How Does a Defined Benefit Plan Differ from a Defined Contribution Plan? ) What's the difference? A pension plan pays a guaranteed amount each month based on salary and years of service. A 401(k) plan, on the other hand, depends on employee and sometimes employer contributions and reflects the performance of the investments within them. (See also: The Basics of a 401(k) Retirement Plan .) While the vast majority of businesses now offer 401(k) plans for retirement, there's a great deal of difference between the most and least generous among them. For example, some employers offer a generous employer match and even additional contributions based on salary. Others offer a better mix of investment options with lower fees. It's a good idea to look at the fine print to see what you're really getting when you enroll. If you are wondering which companies do the best job setting up their employees for financial security in retirement, take a look at our list for the best retirement plans.
