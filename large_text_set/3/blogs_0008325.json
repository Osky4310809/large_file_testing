The series which is being penned by Matt Nix has already brought on a slew of talent, and it has just added yet another star. According to Deadline , Burn Notic e’s Coby Bell has officially signed onto the yet-titled series. \nStarring opposite of Amy Acker and Stephen Moyer, Bell is set to play a character named Jace Turner. The man is described as a “weathered man who quietly wrestles with the moral ambiguities of a job that regularly requires cold-blooded, calculating efficiency on a day-to-day basis.” \nJudging by the character description, fans have a few thoughts as to how Bell’s role will fit into the X-Men series. The show is slated to tell the story of two parents who must go on the run with their fam \nily after they learn their children are mutants. Forced to flee, the family must evade authorities who represent the government’s hostile take on mutants. To do so, they eventually join an underground network of mutants who have also been put on the run, and everyone must band together to survive. \nPreviously, Bell has had plenty of experience on television programs. Fans will know the actor best for his prolonged run on The Game where he played Jason Pitts. Bell was also cast as Jesse Porter for Burn Notice . \nSo far, the X-Men pilot seems to be collecting an eclectic cast. Not long ago, fans learned the series had tapped one starlet to play a familiar mutant. Emma Dumont was announced as a cast member and that she would be playing Lorna Dane, AKA: Polaris. The actress’ role was said to be that of a “strong-willed, brave and loyal mutant who has the ability to manipulate magnetism.” In the Marvel comics, Polaris is a well-known mutant who debuted in October 1968 as Magneto’s biological daughter. \nMORE: Gotham Actress Cast In Fox's X-Men TV Pilot / X-Men TV Series Casts Stephen Moyer In Lead Role / X-Men TV Series Casts First Actor / X-Men TV Series Gets Official Pilot Order \nThe X-Men pilot is being written by Matt Nix and directed by Bryan Singer with a script that focuses on two parents who discover their children are mutants. The family then has to go on the run and joins an underground network dedicated to saving mutants. \nLauren Shuler Donner, Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg, Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory will executive produce the pilot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:10:26.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
