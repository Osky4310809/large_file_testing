Adam Schiff agreed that the FBI will brief the entire panel on the counterintelligence investigation, instead of just the two of them. \nSecond, he noted he has asked FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Michael S. Rogers to appear in closed session, postponing their next public hearing. Asked if the committee is meeting with Comey in a closed session because he was not fully forthcoming at Monday’s hearing, Nunes said there were questions he “probably couldn’t answer in public session.” Nunes also told reporters he was not calling Comey back based on documents he's seen. \nThird, Nunes said the NSA has kept them \"completely informed\" and it is possible they will receive the documents they have requested on Friday, though he “doesn’t expect the entirety of everything they need.” \nFinally, and perhaps most newsy, former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort has volunteered to interview with the committee about the investigation. Nunes thanked Manafort for his cooperation and encouraged others to do the same. \nNunes also offered a few points of clarification. First, he insisted that his Wednesday presser had not been orchestrated by the White House. He has faced backlash though, for sharing information with the president before he briefed his own committee. \nAs for the Obama intelligence officials’ surveillance, “it looks like it was all legal\" and Trump's wiretap claim is just a claim. \n“There was no wiretapping of Trump Tower,” Nunes said. “That didn’t happen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:16:28.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
