Little Landyn Melton was found frozen to death on the front porch \nThe investigation into Landyn's death, being handled by the local Sheriff’s Office Criminal Investigation Division, is continuing. \nOne theory being worked on by investigators is that a storm door may have closed after the child got out. \nOfficials told Channel 9 News that they were called to a house on Hopewell Road at around 7:45am last Wednesday. \nInvestigators believe he died after being exposed to the freezing conditions for too long - after wandering out on his own.
