Bihar CM adds colour to Lotus, sparks debate Nitish Kumar sketching NDA return? Bihar CM adds colour to Lotus, sparks debate Time and again Nitish has tried to increase his political bonhomie PM Narendra Modi. Nitish's gimmicks are being considered as a move to put alliance partner RJD in check. By: FE Online | Published: February 5, 2017 1:57 PM Bihar CM Nitish Kumar expressed his gratitude for the support. He thanked everyone for their participation in spreading awareness on de-addiction & prohibition of liquor in the state. (ANI) \nIn a startling gesture, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday added colour to to a lotus sketch portrayed by an artist the Patna Book Fair. Nitish, didn’t paint the Lotus pink, but saffron-the colour of Bhartiya Janata Party’s elections symbol. \nNitish’s act created a political debate. Speaking to news agency ANI, BJP MP Giriraj Singh said that Nitish was painting his “political ambitions” and wants to show RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav that he is independent. “Wo (Nitish) apni ranjinitk rang bhar rahe thay, Laluji ko baar baar wo zaroor dikhaate rehte hain ki main swatantra hun,” he said. \nTime and again Nitish has tried to increase his political bonhomie PM Narendra Modi . Nitish’s gimmicks are being considered as a move to put alliance partner RJD in check. \nAfter a bitterly-fought 2015 Bihar elections, the two leaders first shared stage at a function in Hajipur in March 2016. Nitish limited his speech to praising the Modi government’s cooperation and invited the Prime Minister to visit Bihar over and over again, which left everyone guessing. On his part, Modi addressed Nitish as a ‘mitra’. \nWhen all Opposition parties, including the JD(U)’s alliance partners Congress and RJD, rallied against demonetisation, Nitish chose to praise the Prime Minister and support the move. Nitish said the move to withdraw high-value currencies would help in curbing corruption and flush out black money . He also demanded a strong legislation to track benami property transactions. \nLittle over a month after Nitish endorsed demonetisation, PM Modi praised the Bihar Chief Minister for imposing prohibition in the state and the arrangements put in place for celebrating the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh. “I want to congratulate Nitish Kumar for his strong move on prohibition despite objections from all quarters. It is a courageous step.” \nWith IANS Inputs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T10:32:25.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
