Freaking. Over the place.\n“It’s a character from Season 1 that will be thrust into the world that you are left with at the end of Coven , which is sort of like the male/female/witch academy,” Murphy said. “And then all of those characters will intertwine, which is confusing because some of them are from Seasons 1 and 3. Like, Sarah Paulson will probably be playing 18 characters.” Whoa. Obviously, we should expect Paulson to play Billie Dean Howard, her Murder House character who also appeared in Hotel , and newly-coined Supreme Cordelia Foxx from Coven . But given what Murphy said and his tendency to have Paulson play multiple roles in one season (she basically played three in Roanoke — Audrey Tindall, the fictional version of Shelby Miller, and the older version of her amazing Asylum character, Lana Winters, and also played conjoined twin sisters in Freak Show ), we would’t be surprised if the two of them upped their record for the big crossover extravaganza and had her play, say, four.\nFX Unfortunately, due to everything on Murphy and Paulson’s plates right now, we’ll have to wait to find out. AHS has been renewed for three more seasons through 2019, but FX CEO John Landgraf said in a statement last week that only Season 7’s theme is decided — and of course, as Murphy just told EW, Season 7 will not be the crossover.\n“We know explicitly what next season is about, which is seven, but we don’t know what the eighth and ninth seasons are about,” Landgraf said. “We’re extending it out of trust and goodwill but also, Ryan made a commitment that he would continue to run that show and that he would be involved as he has been in the past with… designing and building the show from the ground up. So I honestly couldn’t tell you what Seasons 8 or 9 [could] be, but I can only tell you that I’m really excited about Season 7 and I’m utterly confident that Seasons 8 and 9 will be equally original and interesting.”\n(Pssst…FX…if you find a way to bring Lana Winters back no one will be mad at you, K?)\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:39:39.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
