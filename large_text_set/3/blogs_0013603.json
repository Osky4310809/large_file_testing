Second: \nI want to help you understand how to properly and effectively implement delay pedals as tools in hand to make you a better, more melodic and more rhythmic guitar player. \nThere’s plenty here for guitar pedal rookies and seasoned veterans alike. Anyone who uses, or wants to use a delay pedal can learn a few best practices from someone who has gone to great lengths to \"figure out\" the delay effect. \nLet's start by introducing some of the science involved. What is a delay pedal? \nFrom a technical standpoint, the delay effect is one of the simplest. \nIn its most basic form, a delay circuit (analog or digital) records the input of your guitar, stores it in some kind of medium, then plays it back after a given period of time. In other words, it repeats and echoes what you play. \nHere's what one such circuit might look like: \nDelay line block diagram. | Image via Wikimedia Commons \nYour guitar's signal goes into two places. Bypass circuit Delay circuit or \"delay line\" \nBoth sounds are then sent to the output of the pedal. \nThe delayed element or \"echo\" can be repeated either once or multiple times (n times) as it can be passed back through the recording and storage medium (the \"feedback line\" in the above diagram). This creates a decaying delay sound, which gives the sensation that the echo is trailing off. \nWhile this has always been the theory and science behind the delay effect, its physical implementation has taken primarily three different forms over the years. \nThat history is as follows: Tape echo systems: 1940s and 50s Analog effects units: 1970s Digital effects pedals: 1984 \nSince the 1980s we've also developed plugins, which can be built to mimic either digital or analog delay sounds, the two of which are (in many cases) quite distinct from each other. \nWe'll talk more about the distinctions between analog and digital delay later on. \nThe MXR Carbon Copy analog delay pedal. | Flickr Commons Image via Roadside Guitars What you can control \nDelay pedals, regardless of era, will allow you to control three basic variables: Length or time (an amount of time usually given in milliseconds that the delay is recorded and played back) Number of repeats or echoes and how quickly they decay Mix or “blend” between the dry signal and the delayed sounds \nThese controls are nearly universal to all delay pedals, though many varieties will add one or more of the following additional controls: Intensity Feedback Modulation \nWhile modulation is usually a type of chorus or vibrato effect added to the delay, like we see in the EHX Memory Man , intensity and feedback can mean different things on different pedals. For example, a feedback knob might refer to a reverb, increase in presence or the number of times an echo is fed back into the loop via a feedback line, which we saw in our original diagram. All this depends, of course, on the design of the pedal in question and the verbiage used to label knobs. \nIntensity could sometimes refer to the mix or the EQ of the echoes created by the delay circuit. \nTypically, a delay pedal control scheme looks something like this: \nThese are sample settings from the MXR Carbon Copy Analog delay \nYou've got three knobs titled REGEN, MIX, and DELAY, as well as a modulation button. \nAs expected, MIX controls the blend of the wet and dry signal. But what about the other two? Using terms like \"REGEN\" and \"DELAY\" is a bit cryptic, but here's what they do: REGEN: Controls the decay or repeats of the echo DELAY: Controls how much time the circuit records the input signal \nAs I mentioned, different manufacturers use different terms but the functionality is almost always the same. \nHere's another analog delay pedal with a similar control scheme: \nFlickr Commons Image Courtesy of Terekhova \nOnce again we see the three primary controls, delay time, mix and decay (labeled REGEN) with some additional modulation options via the smaller knobs on top of the pedal. \nNow that we've seen what we can control on a delay pedal, let's look a little deeper into the differences between analog and digital delay circuits. Digital vs. analog delay pedals \nUnderstanding the difference between these two types of delay pedal is important when assessing value. Because, in most cases, analog delay pedals are viewed as a more vintage and \"genuine\" form of the effect. \nFor example, almost all boutique delay pedals are built with an analog circuit. Moreover, they're usually more expensive and more heavily sought after. And in a more speculative sense, many guitarists find them to simply sound better and are often assumed to have a more pure tone that's consistent with (or at least closer to) the original design of the early tape delay boxes. \nThey're also more expensive to produce because of the parts that need to be used to build the circuits. \nBut digital delay pedals have gotten better in recent years, and there are plenty of them that are hard to tell from their analog counterparts. The Line 6 DL4 Delay Modeler , which has tape echo models built in, and the Boss DD-20 Giga Delay are two good examples. Digital delay pedals also tend to have more control than their analog siblings, because a digital signal is simply easier to manipulate. \nHere are the raw technical differences for each type of delay: Digital Delay Pedals : Use digital signal processors (DSPs) or analog-to-digital converters to record a guitar’s input and then play it back as an echo. Analog Delay Pedals : As the original method of creating delay or \"tape echo\" effects, these pedals utilize bucket brigade circuitry to store a signal and move it through a line of capacitors before outputting the signal as an echo of the original input. In a bucket-brigade device, the analog signal is received from the guitar and runs through a sequence of capacitors , C0 to Cn. Its name is based on the imagery of several people passing along a bucket of water. Which one is \"better?\" \nThe output of an analog delay is distinct and is said to have a more natural sound that isn't easily confused with digitized echoes. A digital delay pedal will sound more sterile and might also lack the warmth and \"sweetness\" that analog delays are known for. \nAs I mentioned, analog delay pedals are viewed by many guitar players as the more authentic-sounding of the two options. However, it's also true that DSPs are cheaper to produce meaning you'll often have more features and \"modes\" for a lower price tag. \nWhich one? | Flickr Commons Image via ThomasThomas \nIt might be helpful to think of the difference between the two, in the same way you would think of a solid state and tube amplifier. \nAnalog delays are the tube amps of the pedal world. \nAs for which one is \"better\" it's all a matter of context and what you prefer. Typically I'd recommend analog delay pedals to people who care less about features and more about tonal purity. For those who want more features and control over their delay, digital pedals are often a better solution for them. \nFor example, tap tempo, multiple delay modes, and more controls are far more likely to show up in delay pedals run by a DSP than an analog stompbox. In almost all digital vs. analog delay pedal comparisons, that's the trade-off you'll need to assess. \nBoss DD-6 Digital Delay Pedal | Flickr Image via RainbowCave \nThe quality gaps will also vary between specific delay pedal comparisons and brands. \nWhen you're shopping, you might want to seek a good compromise between the authentic tone of analog circuitry and the customization options that are afforded to us by delay pedals controlled by DSPs. \nThis is partly why I like the EHX Memory Boy so much. It combines many of the benefits typically found in both digital and analog delay pedals. Where should a delay pedal go in a signal chain? \nOne of my favorite graphics for explaining any kind of pedal placement are the ones developed by Strymon that I've included below. \nThey cover both a straight guitar-to-amp chain, as well as what effects you might want to put into a send/return loop (effects loop). \nBefore digging into the graphics, we should note that a delay pedal is a type of ambient effect, which means it's almost always going to be considered a \"best practice\" to keep it at or near the end of our signal chain. Let's start with the non-effects loop example: \nSetting up a signal chain without an effects loop. | Image via Strymon ( View Larger Image ) \nThe typical order goes compression - distortion - modulation - ambience . Since delay is an ambient effect, it gets pushed to the back of the line right in front of reverb. \nLet's look at the same arrangement with an effects loop: \nSetting up a signal chain with an effects loop. | Image via Strymon ( View Larger Image ) \nIn this example, we have a send/return loop that includes the delay and reverb pedals, while the rest of the chain goes straight into the preamp. \nThis means that the delay effect is bypassing the preamp section of the amplifier and going straight to the power amp instead. If you don't have an effects loop, it's not a deal-breaker, but something to consider if you want to adhere to a strict set of best practices when it comes to placing your delay pedal. \nOtherwise, the only rule is that there are no rules. Examples of delay pedals in professional rigs \nNow that we've seen what a delay pedal is and how we can use it, let's look at what some of the pros have done over the years when including delay pedals in their rigs. \nIt's a popular choice, so there are plenty of examples to choose from. \nRig diagrams are all courtesy of Guitar.com . The Edge \"David Evans\" of U2: 1983 Rig \nThe Edge's amp and pedalboard setup from 1983. | Image via Guitar.com ( View Larger Image ) \nWe can see from the pedalboard diagram that Evans used two EHX Deluxe Memory Man pedals, which were (and still are) completely analog. I've also heard that he used them in conjunction with some type of rotary speaker effect, though I was never able to confirm exactly how. \nHe's also got a compressor at the beginning of his pedal chain, though one of the routes on the first amp switcher bypasses it. Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead: 1997 Rig \nJonny Greenwood's pedalboard from 1997. | Image via Guitar.com ( View Larger Image ) \nRadiohead's guitarist Jonny Greenwood had one of the more involved and complex setups that you would have found around that time. Moreover, he had multiple delay sources. Primarily he used a Roland Space Echo and Boss RV-3 Digital Reverb/Delay. \nIf you look closely, you can see that the RV-3 is the last pedal in the chain before routing to the Space Echo which is then routed straight into a VOX amplifier. Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction: 2012 Rig \nDave Navarro's guitar rig from 2012. | Image via Guitar.com ( View Larger Image ) \nThey're a little hard to see in the graphic, but Dave Navarro actually runs three Boss DD-3 digital delay pedals (numbered 2, 5 and 11) into two different amplifiers, a Marshall JCM 900 and a Fender Twin Reverb. \nMultiple delay pedals are popular among the pros, mostly because it allows them to send different settings and different types of delay effects into multiple amplifiers. If and when you can afford it, the signal splitting benefits are fairly significant. \nSince delay is such a versatile and useful effect, you'll have a hard time finding a professional board that omits it. \nIf you want to check out the delay pedal in more professional rigs, go to the G uitar.com rig diagrams section or Premier Guitar's Rig Rundowns . Popular delay pedals \nWhile there are a ton of fantastic boutique delay pedal options, and more being manufactured all the time, the \"go-to\" delay stompboxes have remained consistent over the past couple decades and are produced largely by the following companies: Boss US (now owned by Roland) MXR (owned by Jim Dunlop) Electro-Harmonix Line 6 TC Electronic \nBetween these five companies, there's a handful of about 10 delay pedals that seem to regularly be at the top of the popularity charts, having become long-term go-to solutions for both amateur and professional guitar players alike. \nThey include the following, in no particular order:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T15:50:03.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
