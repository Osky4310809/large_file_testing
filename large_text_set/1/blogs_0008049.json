Apparently, there was also no place for swordsmen and evil queens. \nThe HBO shows Game Of Thrones and Westworld are both critically celebrated, but that praise wasn't enough to give the shows any hardware at this year's awards show. Game Of Thrones was nominated for two of the awards, while Westworld was nominated for three. \nActresses Thandie Newton and Evan Rachel Wood - from Westworld - were nominated for acting awards, along with Game Of Thrones star Lena Headey. All three were beaten out. \nThe big blow for the HBO juggernauts came later in the show when the Best Television Series - Drama was announced. The shows were thought to be the two favorites for the award, but Netflix came in and stole the show. The Crown was given the award instead. \nGame Of Thrones has made waves across all of television for the last six years, and is now the most awarded show of all time. Westworld only has one season under its belt, but it was the most-watched first season in HBO's storied history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:23:35.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
