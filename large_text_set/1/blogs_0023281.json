At times—“Midnight to Morning” and the spacious “True Love and a Free Life of Free Will”—their Springsteenian indie rock approaches the stadium-sized grandeur of bands like Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam, bridging the energy and commitment of punk with the ambition of center stage. Customer Reviews by Faunce13 These guys should be huge!! Maybe they are just big enough. The songs are great anthems about what lifw ought to be and I can't get enough. AWESOME! by Japandroid rocks! Love this band...I am so excited they have another album coming out. Every song is incredible, and bucks the horrible, plastic and disposible music that is being issued by most rock bands today. Thanks Japandriods!!! God Bless You Boys! by Oldest Emo Kid 2016 saw the end of my favorite band of all time. I wandered around being super emo and just lost I had been a fan of these guys since \"No Singles.\"\"Celebration Rock\" was album of the year for me several years ago. I had thought they had ended. I was freaking out when I found this song on Spotify. The drums and guitar work are, as always amazing. This is my new jam. With the impending album 2017 MAY be the best year musically I have had in years.

Though Japandroids were more or less unknown at the time of their album debut, Post-Nothing got a big boost from the taste-making website...
