Here’s a first look at this year’s poster for Children’s Book Week, the annual celebration of books for kids and teens, which this year runs from May 1-7. \nThe new poster is the handiwork of children’s book illustrator Christian Robinson, and it sports the week’s official slogan: “One World, Many Stories,” to highlight the power of books to unite readers of all backgrounds. \nChristian Robinson designed this year's poster. (Photo: Christian Robinson) \nRobinson has illustrated such picture books as Gaston by Kelly DiPucchio and the Newbery Award-winning Last Stop on Market Street by Matt de la Peña. \nThis will be the 98th annual celebration commemorating books for young people and the joy of reading. Events include appearances by children's authors, read-alouds and book parties. \nThose who attend receive Children's Book Week posters.
