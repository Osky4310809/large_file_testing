It’s also hard to see how the equation doesn’t get better if you throw Compton’s Kendrick Lamar into the mix. \nThat’s exactly what Mike WiLL Made-It has done on his upcoming album Ransom 2 , which is set to drop this coming Friday (March 24). \nHe has all four men on a track called “Perfect Pint,” which was teased in its longest form yet this weekend during the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. \nThe Sremmurd brothers played a couple minutes of the track for a crowd at the festival and The FADER was on hand to grab and share the footage. Both Gucci and Kendrick’s verses can be heard in the video, and it’s enough that we can’t wait to hear the real thing. \nTwitter reacted with unashamed excitement for the track, with one fan saying “This could be the track of the summer.” @thefader @Jxmmi @kendricklamar @gucci1017 Damn. This could be the track of the summer. \n— TaDarrean Land (@TaDarreanLand) March 17, 2017 @thefader that hook sounding so excellent", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:05:05.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
