I’m skeptical this tax increase countywide would be a good thing.” \nNation also said most of the counties in Missouri with such a law enforcement sales taxes are rural and, unlike urban and suburban counties, don’t have a large enough tax base to independently support law enforcement. \nCouncilwoman Barb McGuinness said that passage of the new tax “will be worse for us than the county pool tax.\" \n\"Has the county demonstrated a need for this money?” she asked. \nNation said the new tax “would push our city to the brink.” \nHe said St. Louis County’s population “has been stagnant for decades” and that many people have been moving to St. Charles, Jefferson, Warren and other outlying counties due to lower costs of living. \n“If voters add this tax, it will be another reason for people to flee St. Louis County and will create a less than ideal economic environment,” Nation said. \nHe said the city had favored previous unsuccessful proposals, such as one that would have increased the sales tax by 0.5 percent only in the unincorporated county but which would have generated only $16 million more annually for the county. \n“I’ve heard a number of mayors say they don’t have a need to spend more on law enforcement and that they’d use this money for something else,” Nation said. “This tax would just grow government, make any corrupt government bigger and unduly tax the taxpayers.” \nCouncilman Tom DeCampi said he felt the current sales tax proposal “feels like tax-and-spend redistribution under the guise of public safety.” \nHe called the proposed use of funding by the county for more officer training and more body and dashboard cameras “code that police are bad and can’t be trusted.” \n“I feel it’s a privacy issue — also, bad cops can turn a camera off,” he said. \n“If a city wants these cameras, it can purchase them. We don’t need them in Chesterfield,\" DeCampi said. \"To me, this is something taken out of the playbook of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, which fomented a lot of anti-police rhetoric.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:13:03.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
