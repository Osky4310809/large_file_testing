This playlist has all the music you’ll ever need to paint a picture for your party. Advertisement \nThe playlist, curated by Spotify user kingslayer133 , features nearly 500 tracks of ambient, instrumental music that fits right in with a fantasy, Renaissance theme. Some tracks are the kind you might hear the bard playing at the inn, while others set the stage while fighting an epic enemy on a mountaintop. If you’re building a tabletop campaign or just want to put something on in the background at work, you can find tons of great tracks in here. \nWelcome to our Featured Playlist series. Each week, we’ll share a new themed playlist, embedded for your convenience! You can copy the track list to your service of choice, or listen right here. Have a sweet playlist of your own?
