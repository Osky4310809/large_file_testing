When asked how he would prove he was in fact making America great again, Trump told the Washington Post: “Because I’m going to tell them.” \nHe then added that he believes being a great president has to do with “being a cheerleader for the country.” \n“We’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display our military,” Trump explained. “That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington D.C., for parades.” \nWith the exception of France, Western powers are not known to parade their military throughout domestic cities. On the other hand, parading military forces through domestic cities has long been a hallmark of totalitarian dictators such as Kim Jong Un in North Korea and General Mao Zedong from China, who frequently used military parades to intimidate their citizens.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared Saturday that his country was ready to stand up to any threat posed by the United States as he spoke at a lavish military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the North’s ruling party and trumpet his third-generation leadership.

China’s military staged its first parade in Hong Kong on Sunday, with 3,000 soldiers marching crisply in formation as others rode in armored vehicles and helicopters, as part of efforts by Beijing to boost patriotism and soothe lingering political tensions.

Though Trump did not directly mention enforcing domestic policies as his reason for displaying the military in the streets, it would be hard to deny the chilling effect of military tanks rolling through domestic cities on the American people. \nTrump has made comments in the past supporting autocratic government policies, even praising the Chinese government for using their own military to quell demonstrations in Tiananmen Square . “When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength,” Trump said. These comments will doubtless add fuel to the fire of speculation about Trump’s motives with respect to his planned military parades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T21:33:06.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
