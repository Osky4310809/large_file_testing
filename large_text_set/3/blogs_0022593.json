You probably visited a MAC or Bobbi Brown makeup counter in middle school and were told to put a nude base on your lid, a dark brown on your crease, and smudge like crazy. While this look is universally flattering and wearable, it's likely not going to make your selfie go viral. Thanks to Pat McGrath, the 2017 version of a smoky eye is out of this world — literally — as in, galaxy-inspired.

The trend was first seen when she did the makeup for the Anna Sui Fall 2017 New York Fashion Week show, where the Ultraviolet Blue set was used. \n\"The Dark Star 006 kit is all about the infinite blackness of outer space,\" McGrath said in a press release. \"A star before it goes supernova, the iridescence of a raven's wing, a kohl-rimmed punk with smoke curling from their cigarette, but also a refined rebellion.\" \nOn April 11 at 12 p.m. ET at patmcgrath.com , you can snag a sequin-filled pack ($130) containing seven products to create this iridescent, dark eye makeup look in either UltraViolet Blue or UltraSuede Brown. The offering includes either blue or brown pigment, Astral White pigment, Mercury pigment, Dark Matter pigment, Cyber Clear eye gloss, Black SmudgeLiner eye kohl, and a Blender Brush. There is also the option to buy the six essentials without the blue or brown pigment for $95. \nAt an event to showcase the products to editors, she told our reporter that her goal for this this kit was to help people do a \"real multi-dimensional smoky eye.\" McGrath admitted that she's over flat Instagram eye makeup, which is why this hybrid of gels and creams will give you a more textured, layered look. \nAnd yes, she is OK with you wearing '80s blue eye makeup during the day. \"Absolutely,\" she enthused. \"People aren't that afraid of makeup anymore.\" \nA standout in the set is the holographic gel, which can also be used on cheeks or lips. When you layer it on the Astral White pigment with the Ultraviolet blue, the color looks like an oily sticker from the '90s. (We're referring to this thing , kids.) \nKeep reading to see more images of these chic products and swatches and how gorgeous they look on the eyes! — additional reporting by Kelsey Garcia", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:49:06.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
