I used canned corned beef hash. Made it in the electric frying pan as lorelfs suggested. Covered, it only took 5 minutes (or less) for the eggs to cook. Easy, quick breakfast .\" MY REVIEW laroelfs User ID: 5101757 19708 Reviewed Mar. 24, 2012 \n\"I love corned beef hash, and although this isn't really authentic, in my eyes, it was a quick way to get my fix! I used my electric skillet instead of putting it in the oven. It was delicious!\" MY REVIEW cee-jay User ID: 1579946 43574 Reviewed Mar. 18, 2012 \n\"How many servings does this hash make? At the top of the recipe, it says 8 serving but in the body of the recipe yield 4 servings are listed. This was tasty and a good way to use up the eggs and leftover corned beef but probably not very healthy .\" Similar Recipes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T06:24:37.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
