His official playing status for the AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots has not been announced. Continue for updates. Latest on Green's Practice Status Wednesday, Jan. 18 \nDavid Todd of ESPN Pittsburgh reported Green participated in Wednesday's practice. Concussion Issues Have Hampered Green \nGreen has a history of concussions , as he suffered two during an 11-day span in September 2015. The 26-year-old opened training camp on the physically unable to perform list after undergoing offseason ankle surgery. He also suffered from recurring headaches in August. \nThat was hardly the most encouraging start for the dynamic tight end after he signed a four-year, $20 million deal with the Steelers in the spring, but he rehabilitated and eventually returned to the gridiron in Week 10 against the Dallas Cowboys and started to establish chemistry with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger . \nA year after posting career highs of 37 catches for 429 yards and four touchdowns as a complement to Antonio Gates, Green has hauled in 18 passes for 304 yards and one score through his first six games. He has mostly worked as a supplementary option behind Le'Veon Bell, Antonio Brown , Sammie Coates and Eli Rogers. \nTight end Jesse James has been thrust into a more significant role with Green on the shelf. James has generally been used as a blocking and red-zone specialist, but he's proved to have solid hands and is capable of filling in for Green at a mammoth 6'7\" and 261 pounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T11:35:20.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
