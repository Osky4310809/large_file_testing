(Mike Symington/CBC) Related Stories Calgary Prostate Cancer Centre (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) \nBret 'The Hitman' Hart says early detection was his partner in fighting prostate cancer and now — after finally being given the all-clear by doctors — he's urging men in Calgary to get checked. \n\"I got the word back last week that I'm zero, undetectable, I'm 100 per cent,\" said Hart on CBC Radio's the Calgary Eyeopener on Monday. \n\"My doctor said I'm a walking miracle, he said I've had a better recovery than most men have and I feel like I'm ready to take on the world.\" \nProstate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in men. \nHart says it was a tough surgery but he had lots of good people in his corner, including the Calgary Prostate Cancer Centre. Cancer runs in the family \nHe's won his own fight, but says the disease continues to cast a shadow over his famous fighting family. \nHis father Stu Hart had the disease in his 80s. Now his brother, Smith Hart, also has prostate cancer. Because he didn't get tested, he lost the advantage of an early diagnosis.

It's spread through to his hip bones and it's spread to his femur. He won't likely make it past the next year.\" \n\"He is the perfect example of someone who needed to get checked. He just needed to get his blood work done, needed to get his PSA level checked.\" Early detection \nHart says the cancer can be beaten but men need to take the first steps against it and take them early. \nHe says he was lucky and early detection ultimately saved his life. \n\"All we really need is an effort by men to go get their PSA tests,\" he said. \nThe PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, test measures inflammation. Screening aims to find cancer before symptoms appear and reduce the chance of death with early treatment. \nHart is encouraging men in Calgary to attend a special Bret Hart Men's Health Day at the Calgary Prostate Cancer Centre onFeb. 10, which is providing free PSA blood tests, blood pressure, BMI and blood-glucose tests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:33:17.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
