He despises the Iranian dictatorship & would be thrown in jail if he returned there. He has\n— Jason Kenney (@jkenney) January 29, 2017 \n\nNejatian — who helped form Canada’s own protocol for screening would-be terrorists — said the new order “almost certainly makes the U.S. less safe.”\nFor one thing, the ban is so blunt that it excludes foreign-born nationals regardless of their loyalty to the United States, he noted.\nIn a 2008 count of foreign-born U.S. military personnel, for instance, there were 97 Iranian-born U.S. service members and 13 from Syria.\nA former Israeli minister of defence, Shaul Mofaz, is also threatened by the ban. Although Mofaz is an Israeli citizen, he was born in Tehran in 1948. \nSecondly, Nejatian noted the ban does not cover nationals from such countries as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Not one of the 9/11 hijackers, for instance, would have been barred entry to the United States under the ban.\n“It doesn’t actually target people likely to do harm to the United States,” he said.\nThe order happened to come down while Nejatian was at Kash’s San Francisco offices.\nSteph Crosier/Postmedia Network Approximately 150 people gathered in Kingston, Ont., on Jan. 29 to protest Donald Trump's exclusionary policies. If it had come a week later, it would have stranded him in Canada, cutting him off from the majority of his company’s operations and investors.\n“I would have been a lot less calm about it,” he said.\nU.S. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn said Friday that the order does not apply to anyone with a Canadian passport, but Nejatian said his own immigration lawyer has advised him against running the risk.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection takes its orders from the Department of Homeland Security, which in turn is bound by the directives laid out in Trump’s executive order.\nDue to the uncertainty surrounding the order,  Nejatian said  Flynn’s announcement will have little impact on how it is interpreted by individual agents on the ground.\nConfirmed reports that CBP is now deporting people against orders of a federal judge. Do NOT cross US border. Just don't.\n— Kaz Nejatian (@CanadaKaz) January 29, 2017 \n\nAnd indeed, over the weekend at Washington, D.C.’s Dulles International Airport, Customs and Border Protection personnel continued to detain legal immigrants in defiance of federal court rulings blocking the reach of the order.\nIn the past, Nejatian’s Iranian birthplace has been an object of scrutiny for U.S. border guards, who have asked for proof that he has renounced his Iranian citizenship.\nSince the Islamic Republic of Iran does not typically issue proof of national renunciation, Nejatian has no way of proving he no longer has any legal ties to that country.\nNejatian is now effectively unable to travel home to Canada, since he may be barred re-entry to the United States.\nIn the short term, the order means he’s missing a wedding. In the long term, Nejatian is having to figure out how to remotely manage the company’s Canadian operations.\nRelated Is it safe to travel to the U.S.? For many Canadian travellers with dual citizenship, uncertainty lingers Justin Trudeau finds allies across political lines in signalling disapproval of Trump ’s travel ban ‘Not a Muslim ban’: Trump defends executive order, while chief of staff reverses course on green card holders Michael Den Tandt: Donald Trump ’s refugee ban pushes Canadian politicians to forge common front He also has to figure out the logistics of a cross-border marriage, because his wife lives and works in Toronto.\n“I’m not an anomaly … it’s screwing up thousands and thousands of lives,” he said.\nU.S. tech companies have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the ban. Given their globally sourced workforces, companies from Google to Microsoft to Facebook are now coping with having employees subjected to the ban.\nSince the order was made, Nejatian has been co-ordinating efforts to find Canadian work for visa-holding tech workers rejected at the U.S. border. He said the sheer volume of workers coming to him for help in just one day has brought tears to his eyes.\nNejatian said Kash will always retain an office in the United States, but he has already started to explore shifting operations to Canada.\nNational Post \n• Email: thopper@nationalpost.com | Twitter: TristinHopper \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T03:27:16.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
