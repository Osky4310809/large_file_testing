We strongly believe that the CityMall’s unique synergy with the Jollibee Group, SM Group and ABS-CBN Group will start to show fruition in 2017,” Sia added. \nDoubleDragon recently signed an agreement with broadcasting giant ABS-CBN Corp. for the rollout of cinemas in its CityMall branches across the country. \nCityMall will open 10 cinemas, each with a seating capacity of 100 to 120 seats, in the second quarter of next year. \nThis year, the company also expects to move to its new headquarters, occupying two floors of DoubleDragon Plaza within the 4.8 hectare DD Meridian Park complex in Pasay. \n“I am excited for that because it will mark the start of the corporate maturity of the company as it starts to move out of start-up stage. It is also seen to make DoubleDragon a new serious contender that strives to capture the bright future of the Philippine property industry,” he said. \nFoot traffic at its D8 Mall in Divisoria, meanwhile, more than doubled last year and is seen to further improve this year. \n“We expect D8 Mall to further fortify its market clout in Divisoria by 2017,” Sia added. \nDoubleDragon, formerly Injap Land Corp., was established in 2009 to primarily engage in the business of real estate development and other real estate-related business ventures. \nIn 2012, it became a joint venture between Injap Investments Inc., the holding company of the Sia family and Honeystar Holdings Corp. \nDoubleDragon is confident it can meet its P1 billion net income target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T06:05:21.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
