Rhoderick Armamento, Quezon police provincial director, said Lucena’s anti-illegal drug operatives nabbed Joey Peñamora after he sold a sachet of “shabu” (methamphetamine hydrochloride) in Barangay (village) Cotta around 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday . \nPolice seized five small plastic sachets of shabu weighing seven grams worth P13,000. The suspect also yielded P1,500 cash money believed to be proceeds of his illegal drugs transaction.

The operative said the suspect voluntarily surrendered as a drug pusher and user in the past “Oplan Tokhang” anti-illegal drug campaign. \n“But when we recently received information from his fellow surrenderers that he returned to his illegal activity, we immediately placed him under surveillance and monitoring,” said the undercover policeman.
