Coach Arsene Wenger failed to capture the defender from Lille before the advent of the current campaign but will once again move for the France international. Aurelien Meunier/Getty Images Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev recently commended Sidibe for rejecting a switch to north London last summer, instead choosing to help Monaco to significant success in the UEFA Champions League. He told French radio station RMC (h/t Will Griffee for MailOnline) the player can now move to an elite club in world football after turning his back on Arsenal. \"Djibril Sidibe preferred Monaco to Arsenal, now he is in the French national team, and he can join the top European clubs,\" said Vasilyev. \"He deserves it.\" Here is the player in action: Sidibe recently explained he could decide to stay with his club after fearing he would be left on the bench at a major side, with Manchester City also linked with a move for him. Speaking to RMC (h/t TalkSport ), Sidibe said: \nAs a player, it is always exciting to play against the best, in the best league. Today, I am lucky to play at Monaco, in a good team. We are playing in the Champions League, we are scoring lots of goals, we are still in all the competitions. \nThis risk, in terms of going to a big club, is to become a substitute, to go backwards, to be loaned out. It is always difficult. My criteria is playing time. \nAside from that, if a club that one simply does not refuse wants me and is guaranteeing me considerable playing time, then I will think about it. FRANCK FIFE/Getty Images The full-back, who can feature on both sides of the pitch, has appeared 31 times in Ligue 1 and Europe this term—according to WhoScored.com —and within 12 months has developed into one of the continent's most consistent defenders. Sidibe has also provided five assists for his team-mates. The Gunners are in desperate need to revamp their defence, and Sidibe has the tools to be a regular at the Emirates Stadium. Sidibe is superior at left-back to Nacho Monreal or Kieran Gibbs, and he would offer Wenger increased energy and width. If the manager chooses to stay at Arsenal next term, he will need to recruit players like Sidibe in order to maintain a challenge at the summit of England's top division.
