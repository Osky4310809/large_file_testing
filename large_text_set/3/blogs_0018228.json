JUST IN: FBI Director Comey: “I have no information that supports” Pres. Trump’s wiretapping claims. “We have looked carefully.” pic.twitter.com/KqYgNEpV7m \n— ABC News (@ABC) March 20, 2017 \nComey said that he has no evidence to support that claim. \n“With respect to the president’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets,” Comey said. “And we have looked carefully inside the FBI.” \nComey added that the Department of Justice authorized him to say that their conclusion is the same as the FBI’s. \n“The department has no information that supports those tweets,” he said. \nOn March 4, Trump said in a series of tweets that: \nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! Is it legal for a sitting President to be “wire tapping” a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! I’d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! \nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said last week that the committee has not seen any evidence backing up Trump’s allegation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:47:29.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
