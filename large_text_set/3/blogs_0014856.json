Sky Sports' Bryan Swanson relayed as much: Bryan Swanson @skysports_bryan Arsenal deny reports they've approached Thomas Tuchel to replace Arsene Wenger. Spokesperson: \"not true.\" #AFC #SSNHQ (1/2) 3/20/2017, 7:09:27 AM Bryan Swanson @skysports_bryan Arsenal reiterate that decision on Arsene Wenger's future will be 'mutual, communicated at right time in right way.' #AFC #SSNHQ (2/2) 3/20/2017, 7:10:48 AM Wenger is in the final year of his contract with Arsenal, and per BBC Sport , he said on Saturday he had made a decision on his future and would announce it \"very soon.\" The manager said as much after Arsenal lost 3-1 to West Bromwich Albion, and Baggies boss Tony Pulis indicated his counterpart had decided to stay. Per The Sun 's Neil Ashton , he said: \" I’ll be surprised if he goes,\" and when asked why he replied: \"because he told me.\" The Guardian 's Marcus Christenson had doubts about the link with Tuchel even before Arsenal dismissed it: Marcus Christenson @m_christenson Have read the whole Bild article about Arsenal's 'offer' for Thomas Tuchel and I am not that convinced, seems a bit flimsy, no real detail 3/19/2017, 11:10:20 PM In the eight matches Arsenal have played in all competitions since losing 2-1 to Watford on January 31, they have won just three, against Hull City in the Premier League and non-league sides Sutton United and Lincoln City in the FA Cup. They've lost the other five, 3-1 at the hands of Chelsea , Liverpool and most recently West Brom, along with two 5-1 thrashings by Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League. The league defeats have left them in sixth place, six points outside the top four. Like many, ESPN FC's Mattias Karen believed Wenger had indicated he was leaving after confirming he had made a decision following the West Brom defeat: Mattias Karén @MattiasKaren Wenger says he has decided on future but won't announce it yet. Was this the performance that made up his mind? If so, surely he's going. However, the Mirror 's John Cross is convinced the Frenchman will stay put, a decision Bleacher Report UK's James McNicholas disagrees with: John Cross @johncrossmirror Not expecting an imminent announcement. But am fully expecting Wenger to stay.
