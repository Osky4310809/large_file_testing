For plus-size celebs, though, it’s a different story. According to Chrissy Metz , actress and star of NBC’s “This Is Us,” dressing for an awards show as a plus-size woman is a task fraught with frustration and anxiety. Metz spoke with Yahoo! Style on Thursday, while attending the Cadillac Oscars pre-party at the Chateau Marmont. Discussing the upcoming awards show, Metz admitted, You May Also Like Celebrity Lily Collins Wears Negative Space Eyeliner to Oscars After Party “It’s exciting, but there’s a lot to think about. What am I going to wear? How am I going to do my hair? What about the shoes? What about the jewelry? I know this is a first-world problem, but there’s a lot to think about. I was sitting on my couch last Oscars.” Indeed, according to Radar Online , Metz was seen shopping for dresses just hours before the red carpet—proving that finding A-list worthy duds when you’re not a size two is way harder than it needs to be. (Although, we have to hand it to her, the green cap-sleeve ensemble she ended up with was well worth the last minute scramble.) Metz isn’t the only plus-size star to speak out about the difficulties of dressing for an event as a plus-size woman. Melissa McCarthy famously launched her own clothing line after designers refused to dress her for the 2012 Oscars, and Saturday Night Live star Aidy Bryant recently spoke with Glamour about her personal struggles with getting red-carpet ready. Bryant explained, “There’s no conversation happening between plus-size women and designers. The door is never open…Representation matters. I know seeing bigger women looking great would have mattered to me when I was younger.” All the looks from Oscars 2017:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:43:58.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
