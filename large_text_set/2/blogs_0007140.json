Think about it: You had to pick up a phone, punch in the pizzeria's number, wait for the call to dial through, and then talk to a human being to place your order.\nWorse, sometimes you'd have to leave your house (maybe even in the snow or rain) and pick up the pizza by yourself. Ugh. Walking !\nSEE ALSO: 10 things you should do now that you've welcomed Alexa into your life\nIn 2017, getting pizza delivered to your door requires far less human interaction. It's only a short, simple voice command away if you automate the process with the Amazon Echo or Google Home . The only human you need to deal with is the person making the delivery, and even then, you can just quietly shove a tip in their hand, and never make eye contact.\nSetting up an Amazon Echo or Google Home to order you a pizza is actually really easy to do. With the Echo, you've got two options: Pizza Hut and Domino's. Not into either? Alas, today is not your day — but more options will certainly present themselves soon.\nFor Pizza Hut To start, activate the Pizza Hut Alexa skill . There are a few ways to enable the skill: online, within the Alexa app, or by asking Alexa to enable the skill (\"Alexa, enable Pizza Hut skill\").\nAfter enabling the skill, you'll then be asked to link your Pizza Hut account . If you already have an account, you can just enter your email and password. If you don't have an account, you can create one through the Alexa app:\nUsing the Alexa app is the best way to enable the Pizza Hut skill on your Echo/Echo Dot.\nImage: SCREENSHOT: AMAZON\nOnce you've got the Pizza Hut skill enabled, you'll be asked to link your Pizza Hut account.\nImage: screenshot: amazon\nAfter you've got your account linked, you can say \"Alexa, open Pizza Hut\" or \"Alexa, ask Pizza Hut to place an order\" or \"Alexa, ask Pizza Hut to reorder.\"\nIf you decide to go with a new order, you'll be given a few popular options for pizza toppings/types of pizza (pepperoni, cheese, meat lover's, veggie lover's, etc.), breadsticks, and choices for soda, which is more flexible than what you get with Domino's (see below).\nThe Pizza Hut Alexa skill also gives you the option of paying by credit card or by cash, and you can pick from delivery or carryout.\nBut since this is all about speeding up the process and saving time, we highly recommend going with saving your credit card information into your account and choosing delivery. As with any smart-home task, the fewer steps the better!\nFor Domino's First things first: You'll first need to activate the Domino's Pizza Alexa skill . Next, set up a \"Pizza Profile\" (a.k.a. an account) at www.dominos.com .\nThen, make sure you've got an \"Easy Order\" or recent order saved to your profile. To save an order as an \"Easy Order\" just check off the box above the \"Place your order\" button:\nImage: screenshot: domino's\nAfter everything's set up, you can say: \"Alexa, open Domino's and place my Easy Order.\" And boom — just like that you've ordered a pizza and automated the process for future Netflix binge sessions.\nYou can also track the status of your pizza by saying \"Alexa, ask Domino's to track my order.\"\nThe only caveat is Alexa can only order your saved \"Easy Order.\" If you want something else, you'll need to log into your Pizza Profile and change the \"Easy Order\" to something else. Because of this limitation, we recommend making your \"Easy Order\" your favorite pizza.\nWith Google Home If you went with Google Home instead of the Echo, you can still get in on the future-of-pizza-ordering fun.\nRight now, the only pizza-ordering option is Domino's, so if you don't like their pizza, you're out of luck... for now.\nOrdering pizza with a Google Home is virtually the same as with an Echo, and you'll still need to have an \"Easy Order\" set up in your Pizza Profile beforehand.\nJust like with the Echo's Alexa \"skills,\" you'll need to enable the Domino's \"action\" within the Google Home app.\nBut once you've got that ready to go, you need only say \"OK Google, talk to Domino's\" for that sweet automated pizza life.\nBONUS: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3ZvMbvptvJxuaADKjFeXR8kYh_k=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366000%2F6de4b61e-86b6-4a4e-bdf8-22fa1fbd811a.PNG", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MSXEBMC", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/opa435tzt-9qZGNIhES8PeLPvg4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F362113%2F5af1c832-afa9-4922-b44f-ef1408139e81.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4l89C6lIVNkZXObVt_r4szIONmk=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F365995%2F89205998-a0f0-4bfb-b781-c65bf6ede351.PNG", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01B5G99CC", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Bzghp05d.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Bzghp05d.jpg", "https://www.dominos.com/en/pages/customer/#/customer/profile/new", "https://www.pizzahut.com/#/home", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/eLzGzeXGworc165H3ppsI9u9IZY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F362113%2F5af1c832-afa9-4922-b44f-ef1408139e81.png"], "published": "2017-02-08T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:08:36.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
