And did we listen? Yes, because at the end of the day, we had to eat. But thanks to one Reddit user uploading a video of a remote control truck that is also a truly unique CAKE, we can once again feel super conflicted about whether we should play with our food or eat it . \nHow has this not been done before? How is this not THE go-to cake for all childhood birthday parties? And most importantly — how does it taste?! That pile of cake dirt looks both scrumptious and also not th t appetizing at the same time. But 10/10 would play with the truck for five minutes before chowing down on everything (except the wheels — pretty sure they aren't edible but you know there's always gonna be that one kid at the party who tries...) \nDo YOU want a remote control cake for your next birthday? Or, is there another object you'd want to see cake-ified?
