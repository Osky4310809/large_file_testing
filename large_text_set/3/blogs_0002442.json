John Bennett , stating that he “is refusing to meet with Muslims unless they answer questions from an Islamophobic hate group called Act For America.” \nAdam Soltani , the exec director, stated that students from Tulsa’s Peace Academy were given the questionnaire to fill out by one of the lawmaker’s assistants when they arrived at Bennett’s office on Muslim Day at the Capitol, an annual event arranged by CAIR. \nBesides the “beat your wife” question, another of the questions on the document reads as follows: \n“I have heard that, according to accepted Islamic sources, Mohammed, at age of 49, married a 6-year-old girl, and that he had sex with her when he was 52 and she was only 9 years old. Is that really true?” \nBennett has a history of making controversial remarks, whether it be about Islam or politics in general. Last year, he suggested that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton face a firing squad. Back in 2014 , the state rep somehow invoked Nazis when speaking about Muslims that actively practice Islam. \nWatch video above, via Facebook. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:09:27.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
