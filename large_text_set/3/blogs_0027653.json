We did get relegated, mind\" (Photo: Shaun Botterill) Share Get daily   \nIt was only a friendly, but England will take great heart from the way they played against Germany in Dortmund on Wednesday evening. \nManager Gareth Southgate tried out a new formation featuring three central defenders, and for the most part it worked, with England keeping the hosts at bay and even coming close to scoring on a couple of occasions. \nThey still lost in the end, though. \nLukas Podolski's brilliant winner on his final international appearance settled the clash in the hosts' favour, and left Southgate with much to think about ahead of Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Lithuania. He's still there now (Photo: Maja Hitij) \nBut how did the evening unfold for the new England boss? \nTake a step into his world. Before the game, he learned a valuable lesson about what life is like when you're the boss \"Are they laughing at me? They're laughing a me aren't they? Why are they laughing at me?\" (Photo: Shaun Botterill) But he didn't let the game put him off from his real goal as England manager - a spot in one of those Burton ads they like to trot out before a major tournament \" nd BLUE STEEL\"   He made sure he sang the anthem, which is VERY important \"...happy and glorious, long to...\" (Photo: Michael Regan - The FA) Then when the game started, he tried to perfect his new \"hard man\" persona \"I watched three-quarters of an episode of Ross Kemp on Gangs last night, so I think I've got the hang of it\" (Photo: Michael Regan - The FA) He made sure he encouraged the players \"Joe. Joe! Like this, yeah?\" (Photo: Michael Regan - The FA) And he was steadfast in his approach \"Round thing. Goal. Right?\" (Photo: PA Wire) But sure enough, he soon experienced the one thing which is inevitable for any England manager (except Sam Allardyce) - defeat \"Anyone fancy a pint of wine?\" (Photo: Shaun Botterill) \nHopefully Sunday's clash with Lithuania is a happier occasion for him. \nAnd he brings out the Blue Steel again. poll loading Will Gareth Southgate be a success with England? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:14:24.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
