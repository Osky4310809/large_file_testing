I’ve coached with him and I know he knows his stuff.” \nRobinson has already reached out to Taylor, who many fear may need to head to England’s Super League to resurrect his coaching career.

He’s a good friend and a good coach and I wanted to make sure he was okay,” Robinson said. \n“He knows the coaching world and what the risks are and what the rewards are. \n“Yeah, it’s not a nice week for JT. He’ll move on. \n“The Tigers made a decision and they’ve got to make sure they get fixed what they think’s wrong. \n“They thought JT was a part of that but I’m sure that’s not it.” 'I found out on Twitter' 1:01 \nRobinson refused to say whether he believed the Tigers had sacked Taylor too early in the season. \n“I’m not an administrator. I don’t understand what was going on at the Tigers,” Robinson said. \n“I don’t know really anybody there except for Jason. \n“So my opinion’s going to be biased; so it’s not for me to comment on when boards and that make decisions.” \nLive stream the round four NRL action on FOX SPORTS.
