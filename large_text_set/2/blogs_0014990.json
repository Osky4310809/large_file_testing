pre-season, but ... Ty Vickery makes an impact, Eric Mackenzie in strife, Give Tom Lynch the Coleman Medal  51pm by Staff Writers Source: FOX SPORTS YES it’s only February, but new recruit Ty Vickery could have a big impact for Hawthorn in 2017. \nA fascinating player for all football watchers — particularly Richmond fans — over his career to date, Vickery left the Tigers to join the Hawks as a free agent late last year. \nAnd in his first game in brown and gold against Geelong on Friday night, the maligned big man showed his potential value, especially in the ruck with 57 per cent of his hit-outs going to the advantage of a teammate. \nWhile Vickery showed some dangerous signs up forward during his eight-season Richmond stint, Fox Footy analyst David King said the ex-Tiger would be just as beneficial to the Hawks in the ruck. \n“We know he’s a quality forward line player, but he is an elite ruckman. He’s a great tap ruckman, in my opinion, that can pinch-hit forward,” King told Fox Footy . \n“I think Ty Vickery will have an outstanding season for the Hawthorn Football Club.” \nThe Hawks have been open in their reasoning behind targeting Vickery, who they believe can fill the chasm left by retired forward-ruck David Hale. \n“If Ty can find his mojo and show us all the talent we think that’s there beneath that surface, he’s going to be invaluable to the Hawks,” Hawthorn champion Dermott Brereton said. \nVickery wasn’t the only player — or team — that got fans and on-lookers excited for the 2017 season over the weekend. \nHere’s foxfooty.com.au’s first edition of It’s only pre-season, but … Jobe's 'wonderful' ovation \nIT’S ONLY PRE-SEASON, BUT … \n… That Essendon mosquito fleet is super exciting. \nJOSH Green, Orazio Fantasia, Travis Colyer and Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti — it’s already a good line-up on paper, but seeing the small forward quartet work together on Friday night against Collingwood was enthralling. The four of them kicked nine of the Bombers’ 14 goals, but their forward pressure and ball movement would’ve been just as pleasing for coach John Worsfold. \n… Collingwood might’ve found a player to give it some composure off half-back. \nAN accurate left-footer, Tom Phillips was excellent against the Bombers, racking up a team-high 24 disposals and nine marks. But it was ability to chop off opposition forward forays that was most noticeable, finishing with six intercept possessions and two intercept marks. A lot to like. \n… Aaron Black might turn into one of the biggest bargains of last year’s trade period. \nAFTER playing just three games in two seasons at North Melbourne, Black was traded to Geelong in exchange for just Pick 92. But the tall forward showed his potential value on Friday night against Hawthorn, booting three third-quarter goals to inspire a Cats fightback before slotting a fourth major in the final term against a strong breeze. Perhaps the pressure on Harry Taylor and Tom Hawkins this season mightn’t be as intense as first thought. Best and worst goal kicking 1:12 \n… Nakia Cockatoo looks like he’s arrived as an AFL player. \nSPORTING a bigger, stronger physique against the Hawks on Friday night, Cockatoo was a constant presence in Launceston. Most importantly, he ran the game out well, racking up six of his 14 touches in the final quarter. Cats fans have been waiting for the No. 10 pick to breakthrough for a few years, but perhaps 2017 is his time to emerge. \n… Give the Giants the flag now. \nYES the Eagles’ fielded a second-string side, but the Giants were very slick on Saturday afternoon, especially in the first term. What made the performance just as impressive was the fact they were missing a host of walk-up starters — Phil Davis, Nick Haynes, Heath Shaw, Tom Scully, Stephen Coniglio, Ryan Griffen, Brett Deledio, Jeremy Cameron, Toby Greene, Steve Johnson, Shane Mumford, Devon Smith, Shane Mumford, Callan Ward and Dylan Shiel, just to name ‘a few’ — and that youngsters like Matt Kennedy (22 disposals), Tim Taranto (21) and Will Setterfield (16) all stood up. Scary. \n… Jon Patton looks set for a breakout season. \nOR a “special year” in the words of Fox Footy’s Cam Mooney. The power forward kicked three majors in a commanding performance against the Eagles in Narrandera on Saturday. It’s scary to think how good this team could be, with Patton adding another chink to their very thick armour. \n… Eric Mackenzie’s in for a tough 2017. \nAFTER falling out of favour with West Coast’s match committee during the second half of last year, Mackenzie could’ve been trade bait for the Eagles. Mackenzie would eventually stay, but his return game against GWS on Saturday proved he still sits outside the club’s best 22, highlighted by the fact he was moved off Jon Patton after the tall Giant kicked a few goals. With Jeremy McGovern, Will Schofield and Tom Barrass ahead of him at this stage, Mackenzie seems up against it. Umpire runs into Ziebell 0:30 \n... Travis Cloke might actually be really good for the Bulldogs. \nHIS move from Collingwood was a contentious one - more for Dogs fans than Pie backers, to be fair - but Cloke looked dangerous, particularly in the first half, against Melbourne. He had five marks, three of them contested, before the long break while kicking two goals (one of them of the super variety). He finished the match with eight, a total he reached just four times in 2016, and JLT Community Series games are shorter than premiership season matches. \n... The only change for Jordan Lewis looks to be his colour scheme. \nAS a Hawk, Lewis just racked up possessions - sometimes more than you thought you had seen. He did that again in his Demons debut collecting 28 disposals in a shortened pre-season match. Lewis was as smooth as we’ve come to expect and seemed to easily slot into the midfield mix. And that all in a game where Lewis thought he started poorly. \n... The hype around Oliver Florent might match his talent. \nTHE Sydney youngster showed the class and poise that lead to him being taken with the club’s first pick at last year’s draft. \nFlorent kicked two opening term goals, showing no signs of nerves in his first senior hit out. \nIt has been a remarkable year for the Sandringham Dragons product, who tragically lost his father to cancer last year. \n... A fit Shaun Higgins could make a ton of difference for North Melbourne. \nStruck down with a horrific knee injury in 2016, the Kangaroos were lacking in class and speed - two things Higgins has in abundance. \nThey were both on display against the Swans, with Higgins racking up 21 touches, six tackles and a lovely running goal. \n... The Suns’ injury woes don’t seem to be going anywhere. \nSwingman Sam Day suffered an horrific hip injury early in the first quarter against Brisbane. \nWhile it’s unknown how long he’ll be out of action, it’s the last thing Rodney Eade needed on the eve of season 2017. \n... Give Tom Lynch the Coleman Medal. \nOf the Gold Coast Suns variety, that is. \nHe only slotted one goal, but he looks like he’s capable of blowing a game wide open. \nWatch this space.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:03:07.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
