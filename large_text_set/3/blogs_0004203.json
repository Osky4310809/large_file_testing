After opening her own studio in Accra in 1955, she brought other women into the profession as apprentices during a career that spanned more than 50 years and included a stint as the official photographer for Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first president. “In Ghana and Accra as a woman, succeeding and thriving in the creative arts is very, very hard, and to uncover this history of this woman, who for 60 years stood her ground, is so empowering,” said Nana Oforiatta-Ayim, founder of ANO, an arts organization in Accra. “It’s important that we know that we are not starting from scratch.”\nPhoto Accra, Ghana.

The show explores various themes — including the link between geography and identity — through sculpture, drawing, photography, architecture, film, research and a public installation.\nThe show marks the first public exhibition of Mrs. Abban’s work. The organization is also helping to honor her legacy by turning her studio into a museum that will not only preserve her work but also offer workshops and space that will nurture the country’s next generation of artists.\nThe works being featured include the photography archive of the Deo Gratias Photo Studio, which shows the city’s early days as a fishing village; a series of structures by the architects Latifah Idriss and Mae Ling Lokko, which show how architecture has shaped the city’s identity. In addition, Paa Joes’s sculptures of fantasy coffins — elaborate creations that range from cars to beasts — highlight the rituals of deaths and funerals.\nPhoto Portrait taken in Accra, Ghana.
