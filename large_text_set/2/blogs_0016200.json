The French hit has quietly expanded overseas to this first new Los Angeles location, right off Lincoln Boulevard.\nThe small, casual Natalie Kazanjian -designed restaurant takes over the former Taco Love space, tucked into the corner of a strip mall. There are tables ringing the front window and one wall, with the rest of the room for inevitable line-standing (seriously, a queue had already formed yesterday, and they’d only just soft-opened) for all those takeout orders.\nThe menu is about as concise as you’d expect: roasted chicken comes with a few different seasoning options and a variety of organic vegetables to pair with. A quarter chicken and two-side deal runs $14.95, and there’s chocolate cake for dessert. The full menu is below.\nThe opening immediately puts Mon Petit Poulet near the top of the rotisserie chicken game in Los Angeles, as others like Fritzi in Downtown and Status Kuo have moved into different concepts. Mon Petit Poulet is open now, keeping limited soft-opening daytime and evening hours out in Venice.\nMon Petit Poulet \n705 Lincoln Blvd. \nVenice, CA \nLadurée Pushes Macarons and Champagne at The Grove [ELA] The Eater Guide to Paris [E] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:58:12.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
