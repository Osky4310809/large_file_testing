It also strains the nation’s expenditures for public services, insurance, and health care, and puts a dent in domestic consumption. \nChina’s latest population development plan , released by the State Council late Wednesday, projects that about a quarter of China’s population will be 60 or older by 2030. That’s up from 13.3 percent of the population in the country’s latest census in 2010. \nThe number of children 14 or younger will decline to 17 percent over the same period, the plan estimated, without saying what base it used for comparison. About 36 percent of the population in 2030 will be 45 to 59, it said. The 2010 census showed that age group accounted for about 20 percent of the total population. \nA shrinking labor force would further erode China’s competitive edge in manufacturing but would also be a drag on consumption, now a major pillar of the economy as it transitions away from old smokestack drivers of growth. \nA year ago, authorities took a big step to try to add to the country’s population pipeline by scrapping the more than three-decade-old one-child policy. That didn’t result in the initial boost that demographers had projected. The most important business stories of the day.
