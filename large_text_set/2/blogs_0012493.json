CBS 2’s Vince Gerasole has the story. \nAt Funston Elementary, the students learned Thursday an unexpected lesson. \n“I just thought there were going to be people dancing,” said 6-year-old, Chloe Avila. \nLate Thursday afternoon, students began filtering into the auditorium, for a perfect attendance assembly. \n“They only told me there was going to be a big surprise,” said 8-year-old, Natalie DelGado. \nAs they wiggled in their seats, students had no idea 100 scooters and bikes were hidden behind a curtain, one for each student. \n“I found out when they opened the curtain,” Del Gado said. “The big surprise – scooters and bikes.” \nThe unveiling was an exhilarating moment. \n“I was all crazy, shaking a lot,” said 6-year-old, Maya DeJesus. \nHere is the backstory: \nOver the weekend 2,500 Chicago area high school athletes spent time doing random acts of kindness. They also donated a dollar each to purchase Thursday’s giveaways at a school where 97 percent of the families are low income. \nThe gifts came with a challenge, to pay it forward, any way a first or second grader could think of. Some students said they would share their crayons and pencils with their friends. \nA life lesson, not just for them, but also for all of us. \nYou might call it the Oprah car give-away for the elementary set, but as you heard from the students, it was so much more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:19:23.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
