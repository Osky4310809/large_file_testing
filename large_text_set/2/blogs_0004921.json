I definitely know how both teams are feeling this week.” \nIn 2016, the Broncos returned with a new quarterback and some key free-agent departures. Nelson said it was a lack of energy and want-to in the season’s biggest moments that led them to miss the playoffs for the first time since 2010. \n“We just didn’t have that same fire,” Nelson said. “We didn’t have the same leadership or cohesiveness on both sides of the ball. It was bickering on both sides of the ball and we’re weren’t as together to get back to the Super Bowl again.” \nBroncos general manager John Elway cited leadership and togetherness as reasons he hired head coach Vance Joseph last month. \nOne of the positives for Nelson, and many others on the Broncos’ defense, was seeing their position coaches retained despite the departure of defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. Nelson said he spoke to his linebackers coach Reggie Herring after the coaching changes and stressed confidence going in 2017. \nNelson had a strong 2016, particularly late in the season when he started five games for an injured Brandon Marshall. He’ll likely push for more playing time next season. Nelson plans to spend three weeks in Jacksonville, Fla., working with Fanatics as part of the players’ association extern program. Then, he’ll return to Houston to train for the upcoming season. He said he might training in Denver, too. \nHe had a message for Broncos fans eager to see better play in 2017: \n“We’re going to come back strong. We’re going to do big things next year. We’re going to be back in the playoffs and back in the Super Bowl. We’re going to bring the fourth Super Bowl ring to Denver. Thank you for supporting us and I hope you continue to support us.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:50:59.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
