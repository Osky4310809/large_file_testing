It is similar to the Richter Scale, which measures the magnitude of earthquakes. On a scale of 0-to-8, each whole number represents a tenfold increase of explosivity. Uses several factors to determine a number, including volume of erupted pyroclastic material (for example, ashfall, pyroclastic flows and other ejecta), height of eruption column, duration in hours and qualitative descriptive terms. (USGS) Major and Notable Eruptions, most VEI 4 and above (1902 - current): (Sources: CNN, National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service & Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program ) May 7, 1902 - La Soufrière on St. Vincent island erupts, resulting in 1,680 deaths. (VEI 4) May 8, 1902 - Mount Pelée on Martinique erupts, destroying the town of St. Pierre, and killing almost 30,000 people. (VEI 4) August 30, 1902 - Mount Pelée on Martinique erupts again, killing more than 1,000 people. (VEI 4) October 24, 1902 - Santa Maria in Guatemala erupts, resulting in more than 1,500 deaths.

(VEI 4) 1912 - Novarupta volcano erupts in Alaska. It is the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century in the United States, producing 21 cubic kilometers of volcanic material. (VEI 6) January 17, 1913 - Colima in Mexico erupts. (VEI 5) 1916 - Cerro Azul in Chile erupts. (VEI 5) May 19, 1919 - Kelut in East Java, Indonesia, erupts, resulting in 5,110 deaths. (VEI 4) January 8, 1933 - Kharimkotan in Russia erupts. (VEI 5) January 15, 1951 - Mount Lamington, Papua New Guinea, erupts and kills 2,942 people.

(VEI 5) March 27, 1986 - Augustine Volcano in Alaska sends up an ash cloud, disrupting air traffic. (VEI 4) April 2, 1991 - The eruption of Pinatubo Volcano in the Philippines results in the loss of 350 lives, mostly from collapsed buildings. (VEI 6) August 8, 1991 - Cerro Hudson in Chile erupts. (VEI 5) March 20, 2010 - The volcano Eyjafjallajokull erupts in Iceland for the first time since an eruption in the early 1820s. (VEI 4) April 14-21, 2010 - A stronger eruption of Eyjafjallajokull expels an ash cloud 30,000 feet into the air, shutting down airports in northern and western Europe for a week. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that the work disruption due to volcanic ash cost the airline industry $1.7 billion in revenue. (VEI 4) September 27, 2014 - Mount Ontake in Japan erupts suddenly, engulfing hikers in an ash cloud. At least 57 people are killed.
