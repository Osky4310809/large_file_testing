Scarsella, 24, was charged with 12 counts of first-degree assault and one count of riot in connection with the Nov. 23, 2015 protest. Scarsella and three friends went to Minneapolis Police's Fourth Precinct that night to live stream an ongoing protest after the death of Jamar Clark, who was shot and killed during a scuffle with police. After weeks of testimony followed by closing arguments, the the jury began deliberating Thursday morning, and reached the verdict after about seven hours. It was announced before a packed courtroom filled with media, legal observers and victims' families. Video played during the trial showed the four men standing at a fence before they were quickly surrounded by a group of about 20 to 30 protesters. The four fled north up Morgan Avenue, but were followed by a smaller group of about five to seven protesters for about a block. Scarsella testified that he opened fire at the group in self-defense when he saw one of them pull out a weapon. None of the shooting victims who testified said they saw anyone pull a knife on Scarsella, and that they ran after him after they heard someone from Scarsella's group shout a racial slur. The prosecution argued that Scarsella is a racist who went to the protest that night to mock the protesters before he ended up shooting them, while the defense argues that he feared for his life. Along with Scarsella, Nathan Gustavsson, 22, of Hermantown; Daniel Macey, 27, of Pine City, and Backman, 28, of Eagan stand charged with second-degree riot and aiding an offender. Gustavsson took the stand in Scarsella's defense on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:42:55.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
