It’s a sad day to be in prison for 20 years and not be able to be a dad, granddad to your children. You know what my son told me today, man, and I almost come to tears? He said he’s proud of me. So, to hear your children say that they’re proud of me means the world to me. \nGary’s jail term was originally a life sentence because of the strict “three strikes and you’re out” laws that made his third felony (stealing a bottle of $79 perfume from a store) an automatic life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. \nHe petitioned to have the theft downgraded to a misdemeanor and for a re-sentencing, which lead to his release.

She wrote, \nI’m so proud of Gary! For a man who was treated pretty unfairly by the justice system, he has zero negative energy. He’s all about joy and positivity and patience. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
