The app is initially available only for iOS devices, and it feels very different from the standard YouTube experience. \nThe app has a youthful, lively design and includes “reaction” features inspired by live-streaming services such as Twitter’s Periscope and Facebook Live. Say hello to #Uptime ! Share and watch videos together. Download now from the App Store https://t.co/Bwo7e4xCgy . Use invite code: PIZZA pic.twitter.com/w9MzqwCibi \n— Uptime (@uptimeApp) March 11, 2017 \nWhen you’re watching a video, your profile icon floats across the screen, and you can comment on the video or post emoji like the smiley face, surprised face, heart eyes, angry face, etc. These reactions will be displayed to anyone who watches the video, even if they’re watching at a later time. However, you can also tap on the screen to leave “sparkles” on the video itself, and these are only shown to those you’re watching with in real-time. \nOther apps have launched in the past with the aim of offering a co-watching experience, like YouTubeSocial , WeMesh , LiveLead , AirTime , and others. But what Uptime has going for it is a polished design, as well as a way to enjoy the app even if friends aren’t able to join and watch immediately. \nThe app was initially spotted by The Verge , which notes that it works best for vertical videos. \nYou can search and share video clips from YouTube to the app to Uptime, making it discoverable by others. A checkbox lets you also notify your friends on the service when you post. Right now, you may not have too many friends using the app, and there isn’t an address book sync feature or ability to import from other social networks – you can only send invites to friends. \nTo be clear, the app is also about public sharing not private messaging. YouTube itself only recently added an in-app messaging feature to its mobile application, which lets you share videos and your comments on them with friends without having to switch to another messaging client or SMS. Uptime is not designed for this private sharing, but is instead a different take on the more public socializing that takes place around video content.
