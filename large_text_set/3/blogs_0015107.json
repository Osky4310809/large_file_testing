As the blog grew, it became his full-time focus. In 2015, he moved to New York with his husband to give his career a boost. “I needed to raise my profile and find my place in New York,” he said. With the help of his publicist, he appeared as an expert on “ Good Morning America ” to redo a bedroom for a design segment called Hot Mess Express. “That experience changed everything,” he said. Latest Project “Projects, you mean?” Mr. Taylor said with a laugh. He keeps a busy travel schedule and takes Mr. Willis, who works part time as an operations manager for Bright.Bazaar while teaching himself web coding, along as much as possible. “I photographed a marketing campaign for Go Hawaii earlier this year and even though I was working the whole trip, I was able to take Toby with me,” he said. “It was lovely for both of us.” Next Mr. Taylor is hunting for a weekend house in the Hamptons or Connecticut. “I’ve been sharing the design journey through my various rental apartments on my blog for years, but homeownership is an entirely different project,” he said. He is also in the early stages of creating a line of housewares. “I’m still learning about licensing and products but the wheels are in motion,” he said. Pinch-M e M oment Appearing once on “Good Morning America” was a dream, but twice, as he did when his second book, “ Dream Decor ” was published in 2016, was more than anything Mr. Taylor could hope for. “I had an amazing time making my books and taking them on tour across America, but appearing on ‘G.M.A.’ was next level,” he said. “There’s a thrill to being on camera and I’m keen to channel that into new projects.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T06:11:56.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
