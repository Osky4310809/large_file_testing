Without the passion, you just have a friendship. For some, being companions is sufficient. But for most, it is not. One of the major casualties of the harried pace of modern marriage is the loss of sexual intimacy. It is too steep a price to pay. Many marriages collapse because the couples had shy away from one of the most vital issues in marriage, that is sex . You need to know that sex is what cements a marriage and keep the couples together even if they having other issues. Having the right sex will help them trust each other and overcome their challenges. Problems in the bedroom can lead to deep dissatisfaction. A marital sex problem is like a canary in a coal mine — a warning alarm that danger lies ahead. \nStart with arousal patterns. Men are quick to be aroused and relatively quick to achieve orgasm. The “spike” rises sharply and drops off just as sharply. Men are especially aroused visually; brain research documents this. So looking at other women, at magazines, videos, and online pornography play a much bigger role in the sexual life of men; Women are aroused more slowly and after achieving orgasm, tend to remain at a high plateau of arousal before dropping off. These are very different physiological patterns. No wonder it is a challenge for couples to really experience mutual satisfaction. These differences must not be ignored; instead they must be incorporated into the lovemaking process. \nWe’l continue from here next week, but lets take some questions from some of our customers \nHello Viewden, I used Boss Rhino Gold gotten from you some months back and I discovered it worked perfectly well for me in that it gave very strong erection without any side effects even though im a hypertensive person. Thank you so much can I have another pack? Ola \nOla, thank you sovery much, Boss Rhino Gold has also been discovered to be safe and effective for Hypertensive and diabetic individuals just like Manup , Rhino 5, Rhino7 and libimax plus and yes, you are welcome to place your order anytime. \nIam a 55 year old and I have a4 inch penis and I want to enlarge it , but im not sure what product to start with that will give a fast result that is permanent without any side effect, cos one of my friends got Vigrx plus and plump cream from you and he got a good increase on his penis. Can I also take the two together or what do you advise? Etaghene \nHello sir, your penis size is quite small so I must say at this point that the rate at which you’ll get result will be a bit slow because your initial size is a bit small. I”ll advise you start with Penis pump , which will bring out the penis faster but temporarily and you can now combine the Penis pump with Vigrx plus and the plump cream which will give a more permanent result when used for about 2 to 4 months. \nI got Vigrx plus from you 3 weeks ago to correct libido loss and weak stamina and im so glad to let you know that my urge for sex is better now and I have very good stamina for sex alongside with strong erection. Can I try Rhino 7 ? I heard it enlarges the penis and also gives very strong erection even though I’m 62 years- Bayo \nVigrx plus is very potent in correcting weak erection, loss of libido and weak stamina in men and some people use it for strong erection on demand and very safe for people with health issues like the diabetics. Yes Rhino 7 is very potent in that it gives strong erection and one capsule last for seven days, it also enlarges the penis for the period of sex; so note that it doesn’t give a permanent enlargement aid if you feel like trying out a new thing, you can go for Rhino 7 . \nI need some vibrators from your store that are quite cheap about 6 or 7 types. What are the ones you can suggest I take for that category? Beauty \nOur small vibrators that are also realistic ( i.e feels like the real skin) but are also affordable includes; Erotic beaver , Tickle your fancy , Carousel cravings , Buzzing Beaver , Buzzing baby rabbit , Vibrating mini make-up brush to mention but a few.
