Damages exceed $75,000, according to the lawsuit. Hsu Chou suffered clavicle and rib fractures , the lawsuit says. \nThe lawsuit says that Hsu Chou was skiing ahead of Moroco, who is from Pennsylvania, on The Star trail, an intermediate run in Blue Sky Basin, when he began snowboarding “out of control” at high speed and struck her from behind. \nHsu Chou’s husband, Chongping Chou, was skiing behind his wife and Moroco and witnessed the collision, court records say. \nThe sole cause of the crash was Moroco’s negligence, the lawsuit says. \n“Defendant, as the uphill and overtaking skier, had the primary duty to avoid skiers below,” the lawsuit says.
