Real have a fantastic team, fantastic players and a fantastic coach. \n\"It’ll be a difficult game but we’re confident and we have a chance to go through. Little things can be the difference.” \nEx-Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso will also go up against his former club in his final season before retiring from the game. \nAlonso was also at the Bernabeu club when they won the Champions League three years ago. \nAnd the Spaniard revealed his initial reaction to the draw.
