London Life Mandy Patinkin on Homeland, refugees and fighting 'false fear' in Donald Trump's America \nPlaying the intelligence chief in TV’s Homeland opened Mandy Patinkin’s eyes to global injustice. He tells Susannah Butter about his work with refugees and fighting ‘false fear’ in Trump’s America Tuesday 7 March 2017 12:00 GMT Click to followES Lifestyle American actor Mandy Patinkin pictured at Union Club, Soho Daniel Hambury/Focus Images Ltd \nIt's an uncanny ability to prefigure real-life news that makes Homeland , now in its sixth season, such compelling drama. This series picks up after a terrorist attack on the Berlin transport network, with a President-elect left vulnerable to assassination and rogue agents giving tip-offs to Iranian intelligence. Mandy Patinkin, who plays CIA veteran Saul Berenson, the show’s moral compass, says: “Homeland holds a mirror up to nature, as Shakespeare said — and when it is at its best it strives to tell both sides of the story.” \nAs the Syrian refugee crisis unfolded, Homeland weaved it into the plot, addressing tensions about global security in the wake of mass displacement. “It created a kind of madness in me,” says Patinkin, 64, who speaks with the same sage authority as his character. “There I was telling a fictional story while the true world was burning around me, with governments saying we should close borders. Even though we were mirroring it and trying to do whatever we could in the story it was creating pain in my heart. I had to do something.” \nThe day filming wrapped, he contacted the International Rescue Committee to arrange a trip to Greek and Serbian refugee camps. That was in 2015 and he still speaks powerfully about the girl in a pink coat who was put into his arms on a beach in Lesbos as her father struggled to get off a boat. \nHe made a return visit last weekend, and has stopped off in London on his way home to New York to tell as many people as he can about what he calls “a tragic nightmare”. How political dramas like House of Cards are tackling Donald Trump \n“I asked one boy from Afghanistan in a camp in Greece who liked making art how he slept,” says Patinkin. “He broke down in tears thinking about his nightmares. I felt bad asking but I want myself and others to witness the effect of this war. You don’t want anyone to suffer like this.” Patinkin asked that boy what he wanted to tell the world. “I said, ‘My job is to be your voice’ and he said he wanted kindness: ‘Please tell people to be kind’.” \nPatinkin wears a black fleece, the pocket filled with teabags that were a gift from a refugee, and white New Balance trainers with huge dirty soles. His famous bushel of facial hair is immaculately trimmed and he jokes about “making sure the hair I have left on my head looks all right”. \nSince his first trip, the EU has made a deal with Turkey, closing the borders in March last year to prevent the movement of displaced people. Now more than 70,000 refugees are stranded in camps across Greece and Serbia because the deal has, Patinkin says, “trapped them in limbo”. \nHe finished this trip at a town two hours from Berlin, where he saw a family he first met on his trip to Lesbos two years ago. Mandy Patinkin sits with two refugee children from Herat Province, Afghanistan \n“When I saw them we wept and held each other,” he says. “Whistling Dixie, their home was beautiful. The kids are in school and already speaking German, the father wants to get a job taking care of the elderly. When we talk about refugees these are the people we are talking about. I wept because I had just come from camps and met families like theirs who are trapped with no legal means to move forward. It’s insanity.” \nSo why are the borders closed? Patinkin, who has “immersed” himself in the refugee crisis, reading as much as he can about it, says we need to look at the “false fear” driving political decisions. Perpetuated by President Trump, it builds on natural anxiety.

It is our common ground and to me the greatest cancer, of a worldwide epidemical nature.” He smiles as he stumbles at the mouthful of the word “epidemical”. “We are brought up without learning or accepting to be uncomfortable. A child hurts their knee and their Mommy or Daddy says ‘Let me kiss it and make it go away’.” Patinkin becomes incensed. “Don’t tell me you need to make it go away. It’s OK that it hurts. Hurting is part of being alive. Everything isn’t about success and sunny days, if you live in London you know that. \n“We need to learn to live in comfort with our differences. The solution is to learn the truth and not make up facts. I accept that fear is natural, so you know to take your children and flee if your house is being bombed. But you don’t need false fear.” \nThat brings him to the other “epidemic” — “alternative truth”. “As Polonius would say in Shakespeare that’s an ill phrase. There’s no such thing, alternative truth is called a lie.” Mandy Patkin with children from the Metadrasi shelter for unaccompanied children, in the town of Mitilini in Lesbos, Greece \nBeing in Homeland puts him in “a privileged position”, with a window on to how much politicians are revealing. The CIA “cares a great deal about whether the show represents the truth” and Patinkin is friends with a number of agents, including Michael Hayden, who ran the CIA during the George W Bush years. “We’ve had long dinners and I asked if it’s true that people can’t be vetted securely so we can see if they are a threat to the United States? He said ‘absolutely not’. He said the US is the gold standard of vetting right now. \n“Three million refugees have entered the US since 1975 and not a single terrorist incident has been committed by any of them. They are watched throughout their lives, it never stops. They are the safest people in your country. That’s real information, so what Trump is doing is false fear and that’s a crime.” Stopping lies has personal significance for Patinkin. “One of the things my whole life is about, to a fault almost, is truth. I was told to lie to my father when he got [pancreatic] cancer. My family said if we told him he had cancer he would take his life. So as a 17-year-old I was told, ‘Lie to Daddy, say he has hepatitis’. I did and I never got the opportunity to have a truthful conversation with my father about what he was facing.” \nHe continues: “I have suffered from this for ever but it’s given me a gift. I know we can’t afford lies. When I hear a lie in my voice I am ruthless with myself. We can’t afford these lies that are closing borders, closing dialogue, closing imaginations of our leaders to come up with a safe, secure, legal system for people fleeing the most horrible lives to have a future.” Appearing in Homeland with Claire Danes (JoJo Whilden/SHOWTIME) \nPausing for breath, he says: “Have I exhausted you? You are not the first to want to get away from me.” \nDespite political gridlock and its consequences (“I didn’t want to give the people in the camps false hope, I just told them to stay strong”), Patinkin is driven by a positive outlook, inspired by his Homeland character. “Saul teaches people to listen better and will never give up being optimistic. He lives to make the world a healthy, healing place, to save all humanity.” \nWould he be friends with Saul? “I am. He is the man I want to be and gives me courage. He is more adult than I am, calmer, less emotional. My wife loves Saul too. She thinks he makes Mandy a better guy to be with.” Refugees leaving the Calais Jungle Refugees leaving the Calais Jungle 1/10 \nRefugees surge through a barrier at the camp in Calais Jeremy Selwyn \nThere were chaotic scenes today as thousands of people began to leave the camp Jeremy Selwyn \nHuge queues formed - it came after violent clashes overnight between riot police and migrants Jeremy Selwyn \nWork to flatten the camp was due to begin today Jeremy Selwyn \nThe refugees were told to leave the camp or face arrest and possible deportation Jeremy Selwyn \nDesite chaotic scenes, the refugees were said to be resigned to their fate Jeremy Selwyn \nThe camp’s residents were today being processed before being bussed to temporary accommodation centres Jeremy Selwyn 8/10 \nMore than 1,200 police and officials were deployed as the operation to clear the Jungle started Jeremy Selwyn \nToday’s first wave of departures were voluntary Jeremy Selwyn 10/10 \nCamp residents, mostly men and male teenagers, gradually streamed out carrying belongings in suitcases and bin bags Jeremy Selwyn \nAs we speak, he twirls his wedding ring. His wife, the actress Kathryn Grody was in the camps with him and “sends me about 10 articles every 30 seconds to read, which she then tests me on”. \nThey are friends with a family of Syrian refugees in New Jersey and take them to the theatre: “Their English is getting better, we need to learn more Arabic.” \nPatinkin and Grody have two sons, Isaac, 35, and Gideon, 32, who told him to face his own fear of social media and broadcast his trips to the camps on Facebook Live — “It’s been the best way to get the message out.” \nHe compares the dynamic with his sons to Saul’s relationship with troubled fellow agent Carrie in Homeland. “Carrie and Saul have a mentor/teacher, father/child relationship but, like with my own children, who is the teacher and who is the student constantly shifts. There was a moment where people thought it was sexual with Carrie because she tried to seduce me but she has bipolar disease and using sexual manipulation to get what you want is part of that.” Vile trolls tell councillor she should be 'lynched' for refugee speech \nSaul is devoted to Carrie “because she has uncanny abilities in terms of a sixth sense of human nature and he believes she’s the best bet to make the world a better place.” \nHomeland’s reflection of reality keeps it fresh for him. The current plot revolves around a female President-elect. Is this because the writers expected a Hillary Clinton victory? “I didn’t expect Trump to win,” says Patinkin. “I don’t know about the writers. They were trying to create a conglomeration of Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Her gender isn’t crucial.” \nMaking a show closely linked to current political events can be exhausting. “All humans need a break from reality, some ice cream, a nap. When you do a show like Homeland you never get a break because the minute you walk away from work and look at your phone it’s what you’ve been playing all day. Ironically, I work with refugees to recover from my fictional life, which is a fictional hell, which mirrors the real world. My recovery is to visit the refugees to get my humanity back. I recommend it.” \nBack in the US he’s working on a new film and a musical project, singing Randy Newman’s political songs. \nHe has been inundated with messages on social media from people asking how they can help the refugees. “I’ve said you don’t need to be a politician or a celebrity or even have lots of money, you just need to be a human, speak up at work, write to your member of parliament, donate to important organisations helping these people. And most importantly use your imagination. We are facing a tragic nightmare and we have to do better. There are no excuses. I can’t live with myself if I don’t do something for these people.” \nFollow Susannah Butter on Twitter: @susannahbutter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:59:14.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
