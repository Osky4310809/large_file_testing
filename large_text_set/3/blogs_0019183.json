It was everything else involving his six-day, 50-mile trek up the world’s highest free-standing mountain that was so overwhelming. \nThe UCLA head coach was part of “Conquering Kili,” a mission created by NFL star Chris Long’s Waterboys foundation to raise money to build clean water wells in East Africa. Each year, this mission includes military combat veterans and former NFL players. This year, the group consisted of 14 members, and at 55, Mora was the oldest one. \nHe ended up on the trip thanks to his college buddy Mark Pattison, a former Saints wideout trying to become the first NFL player to climb the Seven Summits (the highest peaks on each continent). Pattison suggested Mora to former Green Beret and ex-Seattle Seahawks long snapper Nate Boyer, who works with Waterboys. Mora later said yes when his pal told him about the idea, even though the coach was the middle of recruiting and trying to hire some new staffers. Mora admits he didn’t quite grasp the mission and what he was getting involved with until he watched a video about Long’s charity . \nTruth be told, Mora truly didn’t get it until his first day in Africa, when he was in the Serengeti, met the people and visited one of the water well sites. Chris Long \n“The most important part of this trip is the wells,” Boyer said. “It’s like a big celebration when you come visit. No longer does one of the young girls’ daily duty have to be to walk five miles to go collect dirty water for her family. \n“Jim saw the impact the wells have on these people, and he said, ‘Man, I’m all in with this thing.’” \nWednesday is World Water Day , a UN-designated day that aims to raise global awareness about water issues, like how 1.8 billion people still use a drinking water source that is contaminated with fecal matter, according to the World Health Organization. The Waterboys’ Conquering Kili mission and projects like it have been vital in helping raise money and awareness for the need to increase access to clean water. \nBoyer joined the Waterboys initiative in 2015, a few months after Long launched it. Long called the day after Boyer got cut from the Seahawks and told him how he’d been following his story. Long knew that Boyer had done relief work building camps for refugees in Darfur before his military service and how he’d walked on at Texas. Nate Boyer Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports \n“I don’t even know what I’m asking for,” Long told him, “but I just want you to be an ambassador for us.” A few days later Boyer noted the “Kilimanjaro” option on the stairclimber and it triggered the idea for Conquering Kili and raising money for water wells and wounded warriors. \n“The clean water crisis demands that we act now,” said Long. “It is a global issue, that we will be forced to face head on in the near future if we do not take action. Clean water is also one of the most efficient, trackable ways to change our world for the better. It ultimately saves lives and completely transforms communities. Waterboys aims to do what is necessary to chip away at the problem, while educating Americans on why it is important. \n“Conquering Kili is a unique opportunity for football players, so used to being leaders, to take on the role of a follower. We get the opportunity to learn from our service men and women, to be inspired by our veterans. In the process, we all benefit from the teamwork and the bond that we share on that mountain. The veteran community are not just heroes, they’re also instrumental in assuming a leadership role in service projects like (these). They know what it means to change the world, to serve and specifically to serve the third world as well as anyone.” Jim Mora Russ Isabella-USA TODAY Sports/Russell Isabella", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:43:29.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
