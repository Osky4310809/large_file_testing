The former San Francisco 49ers signal caller, whose National Anthem protests last season landed him on the cover of TIME Magazine, has not yet signed with a team. Further, he appears to be drawing minimal interest — even as other players, who statistically pale in comparison to Kaepernick, ink new contracts. \nStar Seattle Seahawks defensive back Richard Sherman , a longtime division rival of Kaepernick’s, does not believe Kaepernick is being ignored by NFL teams for football reasons. Friday on First Take , host Molly Qerim asked Sherman if he thought Kaepernick was being blackballed from the NFL. The Seahawks’ defensive back was unequivocal in his response. \n“I’m sure he is,” Sherman said. “It’s difficult to see because he’s played at such a high level, and you see guys, quarterbacks, who have never played at a high level being signed by teams. So it’s difficult to understand.” \nSo far in the offseason, quaterbacks Josh McCown (New York Jets), Mark Sanchez (Chicago Bears), and Brian Hoyer (49ers), have all found new homes. All of them, statistically, do not compare to Kaepernick — who led the 49ers to an NFC Championship in 2013, though his numbers have leveled off since. \nSherman believes Kaepernick remains good enough to start for more than two-thirds of all NFL teams. \nYou don’t have 32 starting-level quarterbacks in this league. You have about eight elites, and then you have the rest of the league. You have about eight, nine elite quarterbacks. You have two or three who have the potential to be elite. And then you have the rest of the teams. So he could play and start on a ton of teams in this league. He would be a starter on probably 20 of the teams in this league. But you’re telling me that you’re going to let other guys, you’re going to pick up some of these other guys and tell me that they’re starters? \nWatch above, via ESPN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T17:44:28.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
