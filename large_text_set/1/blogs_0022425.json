The two seemed friendly during a meeting this weekend where Trump called Comey “more famous than me.” \nComey has been a lightning rod for criticism on both sides of the aisle since the summer for his statements regarding the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. \n“Lightning rod” is the word for it. \nThose on the left are likely to have a coronary over this news, particularly those who felt that Comey’s investigations in the latter days of the campaign hurt Hillary Clinton’s chances. \nAccording to the Washington Examiner, the FBI is investigating several of Trump’s associates and their connections with the Russian government. \nThis would leave Comey in charge of such investigations. \nThe director of the FBI serves a 10-year term, which is supposed to give the director political independence from whatever administration is in the White House. Comey was appointed by President Obama in 2013. \nClinton reportedly planned to fire Comey, had she won.
