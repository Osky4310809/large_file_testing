The Premier League clubs whose games involved the least goals (both scored and conceded) Sunday, 12th March 2017 MIDDLESBROUGH have been boring Premier League fans all season long with their lack of goals - but are they the most boring ever? 1 / 15 GETTY 15. Coventry 1993/94 - 2.1 goals per game \nGibson has become fed up with the team’s lack of application under Karanka’s leadership. \nHe is also worried about the Spaniard’s temperamental attitude towards his squad, which has seen him have several bust-ups with Stewart Downing creating an uncomfortable atmosphere in the dressing room. \nThe Boro chief knows there is a two week international break after this weekend that provides him with time to find a replacement. \nFormer Leicester bosses Nigel Pearson and Claudio Ranieri are on his radar, although luring the Italian tile winner to Teeside could prove difficult. \nBoro’s next three games after the international break are against fellow strugglers Hull, Swansea and mid-table Burnley and Gibson is keen to make a change if he needs to before it is too late. \nGETTY Karanka has been arguing with Stewart Downing \nGETTY Steve Gibson has lost patience with Karanka \nKaranka succeeded Tony Mowbray at the Riverside in 2013 and led Boro to promotion from the Championship last season. \nBut Gibson was left fuming with him in January when Karanka hit out at club bosses for not backing him in the transfer market. \nThe club signed Rudy Gestede from Aston Villa and Chelsea’s Patrick Bamford, but neither of them have been able to hold down regular places in Karanka’s starting XI.Gibson accepts Boro could have been more ambitious in the last transfer window. \nBut he also knows he has funded the signing of more than 45 players since Karanka took charge, including landing the likes of established stars Adam Traore, Alvaro Negredo, Gaston Ramirez and Calum Chambers. \nGibson reckons he has provided Karanka with enough talent to establish Boro as a mid-table outfit in the Premier League. \nThe Spaniard has also been critical of fans this season.
