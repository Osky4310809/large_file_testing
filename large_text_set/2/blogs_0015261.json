The Pelicans ’ star won the honor in his home city of New Orleans, leading the West to a 192-182 victory over the East. In the process, he shattered Wilt Chamberlain’s all-time All-Star Game scoring record.\nIt was clear early on that Davis was the player the West wanted to get going. They ran the first play for him to get a jumper, then fed him for a series of alley-oops throughout the first quarter. Davis had 22 points at halftime and kept going with eight quick ones to begin the third quarter.\nIt looked like Davis’s reign would end once Westbrook started jacking threes in an attempt to become the first player to win three consecutive All-Star MVP awards. But Davis kept gathering putbacks and dunks, including some from Westbrook himself. Davis set the record on an alley-oop pass from Utah’s Gordon Hayward . \n#AnthonyDavis (44 Pts) breaks Wilt Chamberlain's single game #NBAAllstar record of 42 Pts set in 1962 game with this SLAM! pic.twitter.com/RtSs6c2hXv \n— NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 20, 2017 He then cracked the 50-point mark when Stephen Curry bounced the ball off the backboard to him. \nAnd this was one better from James Harden .\nThis is Davis’s fourth All-Star Game and first MVP award. He came close last year when he notched 24 points in just 15 minutes, but lost out to Westbrook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:06:35.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
