It doesn't change the fact that he went far on a GED. \nA lengthy bio of Bill Cosby at Biography.com , includes these passages: More interested in sports than academics, Cosby played on his school's track and football teams. He was placed in a high school for gifted students after scoring high on an IQ test. But Cosby failed to apply himself, and ended up falling behind in his classes. He switched to Germantown High School, and even there he learned that he would have to repeat a grade. In frustration, Cosby dropped out. He worked several odd jobs before joining the U.S. Navy in 1956. ... Regretting his decision to drop out of school, Cosby earned his high school equivalency diploma while in the service. \nImage: WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 11: Bill Cosby speaks onstage at the Thurgood Marshall College Fund 25th Awards Gala on November 11, 2013 in Washington City.
