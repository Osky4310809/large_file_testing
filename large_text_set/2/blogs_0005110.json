This is my true final goodbye, as today I shot my last scene of the Vampire Diaries forever. Coming back for the series finale has been a whirlwind of emotion, nostalgia, love, tears of joy and bittersweet endings. It feels like the beautiful closure we all needed, myself included, and I couldn’t have been happier to come home to be with my TVD set family and friends.”\nShe continued, “I feel the fans family will also be happy with the show’s conclusion when they tune in to watch the last episode air in a few short weeks. From the bottom of my heart, I send you my biggest thanks for the countless years of implicit dedication, passion, support, and undying love from all the fans that have stuck with us on this truly amazing and beautiful journey.”\n“As this last chapter ends, we welcome and look forward to going on to the next adventure and hope that you continue to follow us as our new journeys begin,” Nina wrote. “I grew up on this show and am eternally grateful for all the opportunities it has given me, and so thankful for each and every person who worked on The Vampire Diaries over the last 8 years. We are all pieces of a big puzzle and without every truly amazing cast and crew member, this magical puzzle would not be complete. Thank you for all your hard work, friendship and love. You have touched my heart in ways you will never know.”\nNina signed it, “Katherine, Amara, Tatia, and of course, Elena Gilbert. #TVDforever #FangsForTheMemories”\nTo see photos from the cast party and to see Nina ‘s cool gift to the cast/crew, head over to\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:23:11.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
