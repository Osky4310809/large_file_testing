I’ve met her often since, spending a week with her during filming and we phone each other all the time,” Julie said. \nDown-to-earth Julie has never been fazed by celebrity, once giving then Prime Minister David Cameron a ticking off for not wearing a tie to meet her. Sheridan as Julie in The Moorside \nMore recently she told Phillip Schofield he was wearing more foundation than her and the new This Morning sofa was horrible. \nSo when she met Sheridan in a London coffee bar, she wasn’t too bothered. \n“She needed me more than I need her,” Julie explained. \nBut before long Sheridan had won the approval of the feisty mum.

Yes, she has the showbiz life but she hasn’t forgotten her roots.” \nSheridan didn’t go to drama school. She completed her education at college in Scunthorpe, in her native Lincolnshire. Sheridan with the cast of The Moorside (Photo: BBC) \nHer big TV break came in the comedy series Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps Please. \nBut her comradeship with Julie could have come unstuck in the first few minutes they chatted together. \n“We’d be having a convo and she was just repeating everything I said,” Julie recalled. \n“I looked at her like she had two heads. I thought she was taking the p***. I thought I had a bloody parrot. The Moorside (Photo: BBC) \n“She said: ‘You’re all right, I’m just trying to pick up your twang. If you want me to do it right. I’ve got to do this.’ \n“She’s extraordinary how she can morph into different characters. She went from Cilla Black to playing me. It’s outstanding. \n“And there’s nothing wrong with her accent. I speak funny. I can’t tell how much like me she is...but my mum said she’s spot on.” \nJulie became so close to Sheridan she felt safe opening up, telling her how she was abused by her father. Julie was close friends with Karen Matthews (Photo: Tony Spencer) \nShe also confided in the loss of her six-month old baby to cot death. \n“I put my life into her hands and she didn’t let me down,” Julie said. \n“She never pushed me and said ‘Thank you for giving me so much trust’.” \n“I love her so much. She actually listens to me. There are things in my life that I would trust no other actress to have portrayed. “ \nJulie’s dad was jailed for eight years for abusing her and died of a fatal heart attack behind bars. \n“I was happy when I heard he died,” she said. Julie after giving evidence against Karen (Photo: Daily Mirror) \n“I was in a witness box against my dad and the next time was at Karen ’s trial. But it was different the second time. I didn’t hate the person in the dock.” \nTalking about the heartbreaking cot death, Julie said: “I picked him out of the cot, put him on the bed, blew in his face but nothing.” \nShe told her ex-husband Gary to call an ambulance but her son was dead. \n“Cot death is a mysterious thing. It’s like he forgot to take his next breath. I don’t know how that’s affected me,” she says, with rare tears in her eyes. Karen Matthews (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nThe TV drama shows how Karen’s confession brought all her horrible memories flooding back when she goes to church and talks about the cot death. \n“That scene is the only scene that made me have a lump in my throat,” Julie said. \n“I went to the church because I thought I’d let everyone down. I needed someone to vent off to. \n“The vicar told me to ‘just believe’ but I said ‘how can you believe in somebody who takes your kids?’” \nSo it’s not hard to understand why Julie put her heart and soul into the search for Shannon.
