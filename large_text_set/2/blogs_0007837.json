Appeal: Police want to trace this man (British Transport Police) \nThe woman told the Standard: “A man left the train behind us and said to two men on the platform ‘happy new year’ and they didn’t reply. He said ‘f*** you then’. \n“The two men then said ‘what did you say’ and the man ran up the stairs, past me and my friends and got in the lift.” \nThe man was chased by one of the two men, who then confronted the three friends, all aged 18 and 19. \nShe said: “He came up to me and my friends and said ‘where the f*** is he?’ He went up to my friend and was proper in her face shouting ‘where the f*** is he?’ \n“I was like ‘you don’t need to talk to her like that’. \n“He punched me straight in my nose and I fell straight back and hit my head. \n“I got up and was holding my nose because it was squirting blood and then he hit me again.” \nThe 19-year-old, who is 5ft 1in tall, has said she was still in pain a month after the attack, and has found it difficult to use public transport since the incident. \nShe said: “Because it was so unexpected I was just in shock. When I hit my head on the floor my ears were ringing and my vision was blurry. \n“I was in pain until last week because he broke my nose. I have avoided using public transport which is really difficult because of my job. \n“He’s a grown man and I am not the biggest girl and to hit a woman is just disgusting. \n“It was just so uncalled for. Both of my friends were shocked. Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:06:11.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
