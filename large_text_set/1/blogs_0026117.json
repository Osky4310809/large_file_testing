Credit: Facebook Adam Boult 30 January 2017 • 5:37pm \nA 15-year-old Australian boy has described breaking down in tears on discovering he was barred from joining his schoolmates on a visit to the US later this year, as a result of Donald Trump's controversial executive order barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the States. \nPouya Ghadirian of Melbourne was born in Australia and holds dual Iranian-Australian citizenship. He had been due to take part in the school trip this March, visiting Orlando, Washington, and the US Space and Rocket Center in Alabama. \nSpeaking to the Sydney Morning Herald , Pouya said he believed he was the first Australian to be denied a US visa under the new measures. Watch | Donald Trump's travel ban explained - in 90 seconds 01:33 \nO n arriving at the US Consultate office in Melbourne for a visa interview on Monday morning, Pouya and his father were informed by apologetic consulate officers that, due to the new rules, they could not issue him the paperwork needed to travel to the US. \n\"They were a bit shocked and they didn't know how to handle it.\" Pouya said. \"They said it was the first time it had happened in an Australian embassy. I cried at the consulate and I don’t normally.” \n\"I have an Australian citizenship. I was born here. It doesn't make sense and it can't be right.\" \n“It’s just unbelievable that Iran was added to the list of countries,” he added. “There are a lot of successful Iranian people in the United States that have contributed to the economy and made America what it is.” \n\"And I think it's baseless because there's no evidence to support that any Iranians would pose any threat going to the United States.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T19:54:42.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
