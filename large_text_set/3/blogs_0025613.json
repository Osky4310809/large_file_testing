The Gunners played four games, lost three and won one.\nIt started with a 3-1 defeat to Liverpool and was followed by an utter humiliation by Bayern Munich who won 5-1 at the Emirates in the Champions League.\nArsene Wenger during his side’s defeat to Bayern which saw Arsenal crash out of the Champions League 10-2 on aggregate (Getty) The solitary win was a gimme against non-league Lincoln. After that Arsene Wenger’s side got back to losing ways, going down 3-1 to West Brom.\nSo who were the ‘stars’ of that sorry mess?\nWantaway striker Alexis Sanchez is credited because he ‘scored against Lincoln City and West Brom, and also claimed an assist for Danny Welbeck.’\nAlexis Sanchez at the Hawthorns (Getty) Theo Walcott apparently ‘caught the eye’ (but not the eye of England manager Gareth Southgate though, who thought James Ward-Prowse would be more of a threat against Lithuania).\nTheo Walcott scored against Bayern (Getty) Granit Xhaka meanwhile ‘has been in good form and set up Alexis’ goal’ in the game against West Brom. Arsenal then ask of the reckless tackler: ‘Has he done enough to get your vote?’\nGranit Xhaka: Not amazing form, not great form, just ‘good’ form (Getty) From the reaction on Twitter, it doesn’t seem as though any of the shortlisted trio have done enough so a few other options were put forward.\n@Arsenal ARE YOU HAVING A LAUGH!!!!
