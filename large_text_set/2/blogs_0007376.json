Soon, other Twitter users were chiming in with screenshots of their own, proudly boasting that they, too, had canceled their memberships. (I’ve reached out to Netflix and representatives of Simien for comment and will update if I hear back.) Netflix announced a new anti-white show (Dear White People) that promotes white genocide. \nI cancelled my account, do the same. #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/2HIGqviLHj \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) February 8, 2017 RIP MY EMAIL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:27:05.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
