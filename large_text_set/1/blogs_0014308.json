Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe Junior Masterchef contestant who this week sent the internet into a flurry when a clip of him crying over his ruined fish and chips went viral has redeemed himself on live TV. \nOscar Jefferson, aged eight, was invited onto This Morning to re-do the recipe that went so wrong on the Spanish version of Junior Masterchef – and this time, he did it perfectly. \nWith the help of resident chef Phil Vickery, Oscar was finally able to make perfect fish and chips – and viewers absolutely loved him. Junior Masterchef's Oscar appeared alongside Phil Vickery (Photo: ITV) Viewers loved the cheeky chappy's enthusiasm for cooking (Photo: ITV) Oscar successfully made the recipe that had eluded him on Junior Masterchef (Photo: ITV) \n\"How cute is he!!! You [did] a grand job and never give up your passions,\" one fan told the little boy over Twitter. \n\"Aww this boy on This Morning, bless him,\" wrote another. \nSome even demanded Oscar come back for a regular slot on the ITV chat show, with one suggesting he and Phil could have their own spin-off. \nOne chippie shop even offered Oscar a job on the spot. \nOscar had previously pulled at the ol' heartstrings when the viral clip showed him bursting into tears on Junior Masterchef, and his granddad Michael Jefferson - whose recipe Oscar was trying out - had to come on set to comfort him. \"Don't worry about it it's only cookery. It's not life and death, don't worry,\" he told the little boy. The viral clip showed Oscar sobbing over his ruined meal (Photo: YouTube) He was comforted by the judges and his granddad (Photo: YouTube) Amazingly, Oscar didn't speak a word of Spanish when he moved to the Costa del Sol with his family two years ago. The youngster posed with the British ambassador to Madrid Simon Manley and Spanish chef Marcos Morán after the show. Speaking to The Times after the Masterchef clip had gone viral, Mr Manley said: \"Oscar has been a great ambassador for Britain by becoming the first British boy to go on Spanish Masterchef and speak the language. \"At one stage they spoke to him in English but he replied, 'Why don't you speak to me in Spanish?'\" Catch This Morning on ITV, every weekday at 10.30am.
