CEO David Kirchhoff recently described it as the offspring of 7-Eleven and Whole Foods, and it operates 48 locations in five cities around the country including Austin, Chicago and Philadelphia. According to a recent Forbes writeup , its leaders are planning a nationwide expansion. Supermoon will handle digital, video, OOH, experiential creative and overall brand strategy. \nEarly last year, Tressie Lieberman became the chain’s CMO after working in several top positions within Taco Bell’s marketing team including vp of digital innovation and director of social and digital marketing. She previously held similar roles at Pizza Hut corporate, moving client side after working as an account executive at Ogilvy and Dallas digital agency Slingshot. \n“I’ve learned that people want their food to be healthy and convenient—and that takes great products, innovation, and a partner who can tell that story,” Lieberman said regarding the news. “Supermoon’s ability to combine creative and strategy in unconventional ways makes them a great fit for a fast-growing brand like ours.” \nSupermoon remains a small agency dedicated to “young brands” like Honest Co., Bolthouse Farms and Ancestry.com. \nThe shop’s current incarnation came to life in 2015, more than a decade after CEO Amir Haque first launched his ad agency project Tiny Rebellion. It’s currently led by several area veterans including ECD/partner David DeRoma , president/managing partner Kyle Acquistapace , director of strategy Jill Burgeson and group account director Nicole Rowett . All four spent time with Deutsch. \nRegarding the new client, Acquistapace said, “We live to work with brands who are destined for great things. Snap Kitchen is truly creating a new way to eat.” \nWe don’t currently have spending numbers for the client, but the account is somewhat small as Snap Kitchen has never run video ads or worked with an AOR before, relying instead on its in-house marketing team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:01:10.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
