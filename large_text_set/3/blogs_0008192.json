The mother of missing airman Corrie Mckeague has apologised for any upset caused to 120,000 Facebook users who have followed her story. \nNicola Urquhart's comments came after it emerged \"devastating\" mistakes led to delays in searching a landfill site where police believe her son's remains will be found . \nSupporters on social media responded by telling her \"never be sorry\". \nSuffolk Police are currently searching the landfill site near Cambridge. \nMr Mckeague, 23, from Dunfermline, went missing during a night out in Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk on 24 September. \nHe was last seen going into a loading bay, known as the \"Horseshoe\", which contains waste bins. \nInitial records suggested a bin collected within an hour of his last sighting weighed 11kg (1st 10lb), meaning it could not have contained a person. \nBut on Tuesday it emerged the true weight was 100kg (15st 10lb).

SO PLEASE don't feel bad!! My heart breaks for you.\" \nPolice said finding out about the bin weight mistake \"a few weeks ago\" was \"sobering\" and \"frustrating\". \nIt had been known that Mr Mckeague's mobile phone tracked the same route , and at the same pace, as a bin lorry since early on in the investigation. Image copyright Facebook Image caption Followers on BBC Look East's Facebook page told Mrs Urquhart there was \"no need for an apology\" Searching the landfill site More than 80,000 tonnes of waste was moved at the landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, before the search started The search team has already trawled through 60 tonnes of waste It could take the team of eight trained officers up to 10 weeks to sift through the rubbish The search area covers about 920 sq m (9,900 sq ft) and is up to 8m (26ft) deep Searching the landfill site could cost more than Â£500,000 if it runs to 10 weeks. \nDet Supt Katie Elliott said the line of inquiry was not pursued at the time because of the weight given and details of the waste disposal process. \n\"We understood it would've been such that it would've been likely that Corrie would have been identified through the processing before he could've got here. \n\"We've done further lines of inquiry in to that processing and we understand there is the possibility that Corrie could've got to this landfill site without having been identified through that processing.\" Image copyright Suffolk Constabulary Image caption Mr Mckeague was last seen walking into the \"Horseshoe\" area in Bury St Edmunds at about 03:20 BST on 24 September Image caption A bin was emptied in the Horseshoe about an hour after Mr Mckeague was last seen on CCTV \nShe said the new information has come to light because of detectives \"checking and re-checking\". \nPlans to search the landfill site started early in the new year and has taken weeks to organise, she added. \nMr Mckeague, a gunner in No 2 Sqn, RAF Regiment, was based at Honington in Suffolk. \nIn January it was announced that Mr Mckeague's girlfriend, April Oliver, is pregnant with their child .
