The union claims this was done without bargaining as required by federal law. \nOn Wednesday, the union released a statement saying employees are angry that the company \" recently made a unilateral change in job requirements without the agreement of the union. \" CWA says the issue has been an issue at the bargaining table for months, and they will continue to strike “ until a satisfactory settlement can be reached. ” \n“ We are on strike today because AT&T is hurting us all by violating their bargaining obligations with the union ,” said Robinson Paiz, a maintenance splicer from Los Angeles who joined the strike, according to KXNT . \n“ AT&T technicians work around the clock to make sure our customers get the high-quality service they need and depend on, and we are building AT&T’s billions of dollars in profits, ” he said. @abc7newsbayarea AT&T technicians are on strike pic.twitter.com/1wG6tpJovC — romeL Lucas (@romellucas) March 22, 2017 AT&T workers in Fresno join region wide strike over work duties.

Richter added that the company is the “ only major wireless company with a unionized workforce. ” \n\" A walkout is not in anybody’s best interest and it's unfortunate that the union chose to do that, \" an AT&T spokesman told Fortune . \" We're engaged in discussion with the union to get these employees back to work as soon as possible. \" \nREAD MORE: Verizon, labor union reach deal in principle ending 6-week strike \nWithout a contract, the employees in district 9 say they have been asked to work overtime “ for months on end. ” The contract, which covers thousands of employees who work in the district, expired in April 2016. \nOn Monday, the CWA released an update on the bargaining process, saying they were “ disgusted ” with the company’s “ corporate greed, ” and told its members: “ Stay mobilized, stay unified and stay ANGRY! ” \nLast year, nearly 40,000 Verizon workers went on strike for six weeks, making it the largest strike in US history. The workers were protesting Verizon’s plans to move jobs offshore, cut benefits and pay low wages. The strike was only resolved after former Labor Secretary Tom Perez was able to negotiate a four-year contract.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:56:49.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
