While that's a personal decision , the beliefs behind it can be troubling. There's nothing disgusting or wrong about period sex —and according to the research team behind the period-tracking app Clue , it's not a bad time of month to get it on, either. Your period can affect your sex life, but not in the ways you might imagine. \nHere's how your period—and all the other stages in your cycle— really impact your libido, sensitivity, preferences, and more: \n1. Your cervix becomes lower. \nSome women enjoy this, since the cervix has nerve endings connected to sexual pleasure. Others dislike the sensation of something bumping up against the cervix, though, so these women should save deep-penetration positions like doggy style for ovulation—the time between your periods. \n2. You get a natural lubricant. \nThis is one of the only situations when shower sex —which has a way of washing off natural and store-bought lubricants alike—is actually practical. You're also well-lubricated during ovulation, since your estrogen levels are high, but nothing's going to quite beat the actual blood in this regard. \n3. You may be up for something new. \nSexual desires fluctuate throughout your cycle, including during your period. Some women, for example, have higher sex drives when they're menstruating. A lot of women also report feeling stronger desire when they're ovulating. Some even prefer different activities during different times of month. One study found that women were most into PIV sex during ovulation. \n4. Your breasts might get tender. \nBreast sensitivity peaks around ovulation, so getting them touched may be most enjoyable then. That said, they can also get sensitive before your period, which could be good or bad depending on whether they're sore or not. \n5. BDSM can get more intense. \nSince your pain threshold is lower right before and during your period, your partner might want to be more gentle with you. But if you enjoy consensual BDSM, then it could become even more enjoyable during that time of the month. Who knew? \nIt's important to remember, of course, that while these patterns are all common, they vary widely from person to person. If you want to figure out how your period affects your sex life, consider tracking it ( there are apps for that!). \nAnd in the meantime, enjoy all the sex you want any time of month you want it.
