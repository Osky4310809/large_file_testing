Essentially a Qashqai that’s been given American number plates, it slots under its bigger, seven-seater sibling – which is basically an X-Trail by another name – but above the Juke . \nThe “emotional geometry” exterior design is practically identical to the Qashqai, with a sportier, more extroverted look compared to the Rogue. The only differences compared to the car the rest of the world gets are the boomerang LED tail lights, with dark red lenses echoing the facelifted Rogue . Halogen headlights with daytime running lights come as standard, with automatic LED units available as an option. \nInside, the five-seater Rogue Sport features the company’s “gliding wing” design that is similar to the standard Rogue. Luggage space stands at 648 litres, expandable to 1,730 litres with the rear seats folded. A Divide-N-Hide adjustable boot floor is available on SV and SL trims.

The mid-spec SV adds 17-inch alloy wheels, the aforementioned LED headlights, keyless entry, dual-zone auto climate control and a six-speaker sounds system. \nMeanwhile, the top SL model throws in 19-inch alloys, fog lights, heated leather seats, Remote Engine Start, a NissanConnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen and an Around View Monitor (AVM) with Moving Object Detection (MOD). Other optional extras include a six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat. \nPower comes from a 2.0 litre direct-injected four-cylinder engine that produces 141 hp at 6,000 rpm and 199 Nm of torque at 4,400 rpm, matched to an Xtronic CVT. Under the skin, you’ll find MacPherson strut front and multi-link rear suspension, along with electric power steering and four-wheeled disc brakes.
