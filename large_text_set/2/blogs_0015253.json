The initiative provides livelihood and infrastructure projects in 50 conflict-affected communities in the areas under the 25 MILF base camps. \nThe World Bank said the projects will help improve livelihood and access to basic services; build local capacity in project planning, implementation and management; and strengthen social cohesion among communities. \n“These community projects highlight what we can achieve if we work together. It’s one of the many examples that we see every day resulting from the continued commitment of both the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the government of the Philippines to pursue peace and development in the Bangsamoro and Mindanao in general,” said Ustadz Mohammad Yacob, BDA executive director. \nMore than 650,000 people in 316 conflict-affected communities situated in 75 municipalities have benefited from the trust fund through the construction of new roads, classrooms, health clinics and community centers and improved access to electricity and water supply, said the World Bank. – With John Unson  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:07:26.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
