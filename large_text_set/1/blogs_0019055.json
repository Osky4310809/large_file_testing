It was an easy 15-yard penalty against Rodgers. Then Rodgers bumped Alford with his shoulder on the way back to the field and Alford decided to have some fun. \nAfter a delay of a second or two, Alford fell back into the officials in a flop that would make Manu Ginobili proud. Think about Redd Foxx faking a heart attack . \nAlford isn’t the only person who thinks quarterbacks flop around too much. So he turned the tables in the NFC championship game. It didn’t draw a penalty, but it was pretty funny. View photo Aaron Rodgers got a 15-yard penalty for grabbing Robert Alford’s face mask.
