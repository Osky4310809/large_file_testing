But mid-season friendly matches mixed with qualification matches, I don't think that makes sense. Chris Smalling injured Man United team-mate Phil Jones in England traning (Photo: Getty) Smalling then suffered a leg injury during the friendly clash with Germany   \n\"On top of that the matches are not really big matches so I am not a big fan. But I think one day I will be there so I cannot be very critical.\" \nMourinho could be without both centre-backs for Saturday' clash with West Brom, with the Red Devils manager claiming he lost up to five players through injury during the latest international break of the 13 on duty. \n\"I don't know how but both central defenders got injured in the English camp even before the match,\" Mourinho added. \n\"The match was on the Sunday against Lithuania and they were injured in the training session. We lost four, I think [Paul] Pogba is also out, that's five, so we are a bit in trouble. \n\"I watched Valencia's match yesterday in Ecuador, Marcos Rojo in Bolivia, but they don't arrive until Thursday afternoon. \n\"If you compare our situation with our opponents, West Bromwich Albion, only one player on international duty. They had time to work, time to rest and prepare. It's going to be hard.\" poll loading Do you agree with Jose?
