It's not about dressing up. It is about anonymity. [With anonymity,] one can make quite different music.\" \nGhost Unmasked: Nameless Ghoul Known as Omega Reveals His Identity, His Name Is Martin Persner \nHe continued: \"This is actually a problem with this project. For many musicians, this is not satisfactory. \n\"That is why we had many changes - 10 by now [since the band was founded in 2008]. On the other hand, you can get out of your own artist role and look a little more objectively. You never see yourself as the others see you. And you always see only how you want to be. This is a problem for many.\" \nAsked whether all the lineup changes had a major impact on Ghost's sound, the musician replied: \"No, it's all fixed. In the end, Ghost is like a play. If you see 'Faust,' you do not expect the text to be changed.\" \nDiscussing his role in the band, the nameless one made it pretty clear he's the group's leader, saying: \"I've created the whole project. I've been working for six years, composing, designing stage shows, giving interviews. I feel recognized. This is more difficult for others. [I'm behind] around 95 percent [of all things Ghost].\" \nAsked about future plans, the fella replied: \"Ghost is clearly outlined. Personally, however, I would also like to play guitar in a band. Currently, however, this is difficult, because Ghost takes all my time. I'm like a CEO. [Laughs] When I started, of course, I did not think what might become of it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T10:42:03.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
