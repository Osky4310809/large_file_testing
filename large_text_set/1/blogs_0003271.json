And since 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” came out at the end of 2015, more than 30 percent of the hit film’s overall domestic grosses helped push Disney past a record-breaking $3 billion in the U.S. and Canada in 2016. \nYes, it’s 2017 and we’re still talking about Lucasfilm’s debut “Star Wars” reboot — that’s how massive it was.

The feat was helped by 2016 hits “Finding Dory” at No. 1, “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” at No. 2, “Captain America: Civil War” at No. 3 and also 2015’s “The Force Awakens” in 10th place just for its 2016 ticket sales. \n“Rogue One” earned nearly 93 percent of its total to-date grosses, or $408.2 million, in 2016. It’s still in theaters and has made $439.7 million overall in North America — and counting. \nThe parent to Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, Pixar Animation and Walt Disney Animation enjoyed a record-breaking year, having also recently crossed the $7 billion mark at the worldwide box office for the first time ever. \nHere is the 2016 Top 10 list for the overall domestic box office (figures represent grosses made in 2016 only): \n1. “Finding Dory” (Disney) — $486.3 million 2. “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” (Disney) — $408.2 million 3. “Captain America: Civil War” (Disney) — $408.1 million 4. “The Secret Life of Pets” (Universal) — $368.4 million 5. “The Jungle Book” (Disney) — $364 million 6. “Deadpool” (20th Century Fox) — $363.1 million 7. “Zootopia” (Disney) — $341.3 million 8. “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” (Warner Bros.) — $330.4 million 9. “Suicide Squad” (Warner Bros.) — $325.1 million 10. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” (Disney) $284.7 million \nWalt Disney Studios reported $7.605 billion globally in ticket sales from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 2016. That includes $3.001 billion in the U.S. and Canada for 16 films, including 2015’s “The Force Awakens,” as well as 13 new releases.
