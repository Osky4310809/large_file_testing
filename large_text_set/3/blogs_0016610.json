Errol Spence Jr has earned a shot at Brook's world title after 21 victories \nBrook is stepping back down to the 147lb division after his courageous defeat to middleweight king Gennady Golovkin last September and will face a dangerous opponent in Spence Jr. \nThe American carries a 21-fight unbeaten record, with 18 knockouts, and has vowed to \"jump on\" Brook if he displays any vulnerabilities after the Golovkin fight. Brook defeated Shawn Porter on points to claim the IBF welterweight belt \nBut Brook began his training camp in Spain weeks ago and is confident he will successfully come through the fourth defence of his IBF title. \n'The Special One' has already ruined the unbeaten record of American Shawn Porter when he claimed his world title in 2014.
