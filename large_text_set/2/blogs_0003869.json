Those who continued to smoke regular cigarettes didn't see the benefits (Photo: Getty) \n“We’ve shown that the levels of toxic chemicals in the body from e-cigarettes are considerably lower than suggested in previous studies using simulated experiments.

Our results also suggest that while e-cigarettes are not only safer, the amount of nicotine they provide is not noticeably different to conventional cigarettes. \n“This can help people to stop smoking altogether by dealing with their cravings in a safer way.” \nThe research was funded by Cancer Research UK . \nAlmost 10 million people still smoke across the UK. Smoking is responsible for 96,000 deaths a year. \nMore than two million people use e-cigarettes. \nAlison Cox, Cancer Research UK’s director of cancer prevention, said: “Around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer, so we want to see many more of the UK’s 10 million smokers break their addiction. \n“This study adds to growing evidence that e-cigarettes are a much safer alternative to tobacco, and suggests the long term effects of these products will be minimal. Understanding and communicating the benefits of nicotine replacements, such as e-cigarettes, is an important step towards reducing the number of tobacco-related deaths here in the UK.” \nProf Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, added: “This study provides further evidence that switching to e-cigarettes can significantly reduce harm to smokers, with greatly reduced exposure to carcinogens and toxins.
