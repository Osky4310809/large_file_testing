In England and Wales the decline has been dramatic: since the mid-1990s the number of offences has fallen by half. Vehicle theft has dropped by 86% since 1995 and burglaries by 71%. The most reliable measure of lawbreaking, the Crime Survey for England and Wales, is based on the experiences of victims, rather than perpetrators. But evidence from elsewhere suggests that within the broader decline in lawbreaking is another even more striking one: crime committed by young people. The number of youngsters aged between ten (the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales) and 17 entering the criminal-justice system for the first time has tumbled, down by 84% since 2006. By contrast, the numbers of adults has declined by just 46%. Those numbers partly reflect the fact that the police have abandoned performance targets that had encouraged them to pick up misbehaving youngsters; catching spray-painting teenagers is easier than nabbing burglars. But the decrease has been so dramatic that it almost certainly points to children being more law-abiding today than they used to be. Other measures support this thesis. According to the victims of violence interviewed for the crime survey, between 2006 and 2016 the proportion who thought their attacker was aged 16 or under fell by almost half, from 14% to 8%. And between 2012 and 2015 the proportion of pupils at secondary schools were who temporarily suspended fell from 8.3% to 7.5%. Declines in the numbers of youngsters arrested have been seen in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and America.
