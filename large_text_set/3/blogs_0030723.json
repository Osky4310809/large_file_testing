One felony count was filed for each person. The 15th was for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.\nWarning: Video contains graphic content \n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjxwVuozMnU&w=640&h=390]\nDaleiden said in an email to The Associated Press that the “bogus” charges are coming from “Planned Parenthood’s political cronies.”\n“The public knows the real criminals are Planned Parenthood and their business partners,” Daleiden said.\nThe conversations included officials from Planned Parenthood and StemExpress, a California company that provides blood, tissue and other biological material for medical research and had received fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood.\nIn one of the pair’s videos, Daleiden poses as “Robert Sarkis” of the phoney Biomax Procurement Services and is shown discussing liver tissue with the chief executive of StemExpress at a Northern California restaurant.\nAbortion opponents said the recordings showed Planned Parenthood was illegally harvesting and selling the organs. Planned Parenthood said the videos were deceptively edited to support extremists’ false claims.\n“As we have said from the beginning, and as more than a dozen different state investigations have made clear: Planned Parenthood has done nothing wrong, and the only people who broke the law are those behind the fraudulent tapes,” said Mary Alice Carter, interim vice-president of communications for Planned Parenthood, in a statement.\nRelated ‘Not a scintilla of evidence’ of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood: Judge blocks Texas defunding effort Grand Jury probing Planned Parenthood decides to indict anti-abortion activists instead Undercover activists record video of Planned Parenthood official that could prove fetal organs being sold In April of last year, Daleiden said in a Facebook post that California Department of Justice agents raided his home, seizing all of his video footage along with personal information.\nSince then the case had gone largely quiet, with virtually no revelations about the investigation and no indication that the charges were coming before they were filed Tuesday in San Francisco Superior Court.\nThe case is one of the first of high-profile prosecutions for Becerra, who left the U.S. House to take over for Kamala Harris after she became a U.S. Senator.\nDaleiden and Merritt had previously been indicted in Texas on similar charges in January of 2016, but all of the charges were eventually dropped by July as prosecutors said a grand jury had overstepped its authority. The grand jury had originally been convened to investigate Planned Parenthood, but after finding no wrongdoing turned around and indicted Daleiden and Merritt instead.\nThe videos reignited the American abortion debate when they were released in 2015, and increased Congressional heat against Planned Parenthood that has yet to subside.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T07:14:59.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
