Andrew Yakubu \nThis followed an application by Mr Adeola Adedipe, Yakubu’s counsel, to withdraw the suit. \nAdedipe told the court that his application was due to the prevailing circumstances, particularly since his client had been charged to court and admitted to bail. \n“We consider it necessary to discontinue with this suit, we have served the notice on all the parties and they are not opposed to our application.” \nMrs Rita Ogar and Mr T.A. Agbe, counsel to the EFCC and Attorney-General of the Federation, who are first and second respondents in the suit respectively did not oppose the application. \nThe judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed said since none of the parties opposed the application, the prayer was granted as prayed and he struck out the suit. \nYakubu had been detained by the EFCC over allegations of non-disclosure of assets, fraud and money laundering to the tune of $9.7 million. \nHe approached the court with a breach of fundamental human rights suit, challenging his continued detention without being charged to court. \nBut before the matter could be determined, the EFCC arraigned him on a six-count charge bordering on non-disclosure of assets, money laundering and fraud charges to which he pleaded not guilty. \nHe was admitted to N300 million bail and the case was adjourned till May 9 for commencement of trial. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T18:06:25.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
