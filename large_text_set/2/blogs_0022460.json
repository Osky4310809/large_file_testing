Find out in a bizarre Logan promo! \nThe X-Men franchise has seen a lot of strange crossovers over the years, but a new video released today by the Hydraulic Press Channel might just take the cake. Finnish factory owner Lauri Vuohensilta has built quite a following online crushing various objects in his machine. Now, the Hydraulic Press Channel gets a visit from Logan himself as the attempt is made to put Marvel ‘s fictional alloy Adamantium, through the hydraulic press. Check out the results in the player below! \nRELATED: Watch the Logan Trailer! \nSet in the near future, the film follows a weary Logan (Jackman) as he cares for an ailing Professor X ( Sir Patrick Stewart ) in a hideout on the Mexican border. But Logan’s attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces. \nLittle else is still known about the film’s plot despite its trailer, though we know that the primary villains for the film will include The Reavers as well as Wolverine’s favorite group, Weapon X. The film also has a role for the comics’ Wolverine clone, X-23. She’s played in Logan by Dafne Keen, but it remains to be seen exactly how closely the big screen version of the character will stick to the source material. \nAlso starring Eriq La Salle, Stephen Merchant , Elise Neal and Elizabeth Rodriguez, Logan is coming to theaters on March 3, 2017. Directed by James Mangold ( Walk the Line , The Wolverine ) and scripted by David James Kelly, the 20th Century Fox will mark the ninth (and said to be final) time that Jackman has played the Marvel Comics character on the big screen. \nWhat do you think of this Logan Hydraulic Press Channel video?
