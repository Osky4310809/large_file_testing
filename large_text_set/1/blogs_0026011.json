Adrianne Palicki eventually landed the role that saw her character, and her ex-husband Lance Hunter (Nick Blood), rise through the ranks of S.H.I.E.L.D. while also rekindling their relationship. Over the course of their time on the show, the two actors made the Bobbi/Hunter dynamic one of the most beloved aspects of the show.\nThis is why it came as such a surprise that both characters were written out of the show in season three, after being disbarred from S.H.I.E.L.D. in exchange for their freedom. However, there was a sign of hope for fans, with both characters set to lead Marvel’s Most Wanted , before the spinoff was ultimately passed over by ABC . With the characters still existing in this world of S.H.I.E.L.D. , fans are eager to see them return in some fashion – though that does not appear to be in the cards.\nIn speaking to EW , Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen were asked about the possibility that viewers could see Bobbi and Hunter return again. While the mantra continues to be never say never, it seems quite unlikely. Tancharoen responded by saying, “One can only dream. That’s always on our minds,” which prompted the following response from Whedon, “Once an agent, always an agent, so it’s always out there in the ether. But right now we’re taking a breather.”\nFor most viewers, it would certainly be a disappointment for Bobbi and Hunter to never make another appearance, even if only as a guest star for a small episode arc or even as a cameo. That said, the show will have to find a meaningful way to bring them back. The sendoff that the series gave to both characters still ranks as one of the best moments of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for many, making it almost impossible to have a scenario where that can be topped.\nHowever, this is the Marvel Cinematic Universe after all (which boasts the unofficial tagline “It’s All Connected”), so as long as there is an interest from fans to see it happen, it can certainly be done. As an example, S.H.I.E.L.D. is bringing back Patton Oswalt’s Koenig in its next episode, a character who has also not appeared since season two. There are surely ways that the show’s writers could contrive a story that ties in Bobbi and Hunter’s life in hiding, since the last time that we saw them.\nThese comments from the showrunners make that seem unlikely to happen in the current season – but should the series be renewed for a fifth season , the chance would again arise for this to become a reality.\nAgents Of S.H.I.E.L.D season 4 continues with “Hot Potato Soup” on Tuesday, January 31st on ABC.\nSource: EW", "external_links": ["http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/agents-shield-marvels-most-wanted-show-bobbi-lance.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/agents-shield-marvels-most-wanted-show-bobbi-lance.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/agents-shield-marvels-most-wanted-show-bobbi-lance.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=708&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/agents-shield-marvels-most-wanted-show-bobbi-lance.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/agents-shield-marvels-most-wanted-show-bobbi-lance.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/agents-shield-marvels-most-wanted-show-bobbi-lance.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/agents-shield-marvels-most-wanted-show-bobbi-lance.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/agents-shield-marvels-most-wanted-show-bobbi-lance.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/27/spoiler-room-supernatural-scandal-hawaii-five-0/"], "published": "2017-01-27T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:44:29.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
