Rachel Crooks: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 11:20 am EDT, October 13, 2016 29 Comments By Jessica McBride 595 Share Tweet Follow Rachel Crooks. (LinkedIn) \nRachel Crooks, one of the two women who have accused Donald Trump of unwanted physical contact in The New York Times , is coordinator of international student services at a university in Ohio. \nShe is also a supporter of Hillary Clinton, says The Times. \nThe Trump campaign issued a strongly worded denial on October 12 after the article’s publication, calling it “fiction,” and Trump himself personally denied the allegations to the newspaper. Neither woman reported the allegations to authorities, although they confided in others close to them, says The Times. \nThe allegations come just weeks before the election and as Trump attempts to regain lost momentum following the exposure of the Billy Bush tapes , which captured Trump saying, “I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything…Grab ’em by the p***y. You can do anything.” \nDuring the second presidential debate, Trump denied that he had ever touched women without their consent, and he attempted to shift attention to the pattern of women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault. \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. Crooks Has Worked in Various Capacities for Ohio Universities Rachel Crooks. (Bowling Green University) \nThe Times says that Crooks was a 22-year-old receptionist in 2005 working for The Bayrock Group, “a real estate investment and development company in Trump Tower” when the alleged incident occurred. The Times alleges that Crooks says she introduced herself to Trump outside an elevator, and Trump kissed her “directly on the mouth,” which she considers “so inappropriate.” \nAccording to Crooks’ LinkedIn page , she was an “Office Assistant” for Bayrock Group, LLC “from June 2005 – June 2006.” It’s listed as her first job on her LinkedIn page. \nCrooks is presently Coordinator of International Student Services at Bowling Green State University , in Bowling Green, Ohio, a position she has held since August 2016. Before that time, she worked in various capacities at Tiffin University in Ohio. \nShe was director of International Student Services for 5 years and one month, assistant director of International Enrollment Management for nine months, director of Transfer and Adult Students for four months, Associate Director of Undergraduate Admissions for three years and two months, and Graduate Admissions Representative for 1 year and 2 months. \nAt Tiffin, she was involved in organizing an international dinner focused on the Chinese year of the dragon. She was quoted by the university website as saying, “The value of the International Dinner cannot be overstated. This is our chance as a University to share the cultures of our diverse international student body with members of the TU family and the greater Tiffin community.” Crooks is second from left in the back row. (Facebook) \nTiffin University described her role by saying, “Ms. Crooks advises international students on their F-1 visa regulations, as well as develops programming to promote cultural exchange opportunities on the Tiffin campus. Ms. Crooks also serves as the U.S. liaison for Tiffin University campuses located in Bucharest, Romania, Taipei, Taiwan, and Prague, Czech Republic.” 2. Crooks Is a Campaign Donor & Supporter of Hillary Clinton & Likes a Site on Facebook Called ‘Liberals in America’ Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton arrives at Ohio State University on October 10, 2016 in Columbus, Ohio. (Getty) \nThe New York Times says Crooks (and Jessica Leeds, the second accuser in the story) both “support Hillary Clinton’s campaign for president, and Ms. Crooks has made contributions of less than $200 to President Obama and Mrs. Clinton.” \nThe information comes in the 48th paragraph of a 50-paragraph story. \nTrump’s statement responding to the Times article included this paragraph, “Further, the Times story buries the pro-Clinton financial and social media activity on behalf of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, reinforcing that this truly is nothing more than a political attack. This is a sad day for the Times.” \nIt was not immediately clear which social media activity the Trump statement was referring to; a Twitter page for a Rachel Crooks from Ohio has privatized its Tweets (the site is followed by Brianne Webb, who was named in the Times as Crooks’ sister. The article says Crooks had allegedly confided in Webb about the Trump incident). The Google cache from that Twitter page does have some political Tweets, but you can’t read the full content because of the privatization. Examples: \nOn Facebook, Crooks has liked a site called Liberals in America . Its cover picture is a photo of Barack Obama with the phrase, “Being a Liberal Doesn’t Make You Intelligent. It Is Being Intelligent That Makes You a Liberal.” A sample post from that site: \nThe site contains harsh criticism of Donald Trump. Crooks’ own posts on her page are not public. \nHer other likes include the documentary Godless , which is a film about being an atheist, and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert . \nHer Facebook page says she is in a relationship. 3. Crooks Is a Former Scholar/Athlete & Trump’s Campaign Strongly Denies Crooks’ Story Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump arrives for a rally at the Southeastern Livestock Pavilion in Ocala, Florida on October 12, 2016. (Getty) \nCrooks has a master’s degree in the Humanities from Tiffin University , as well as a bachelor of arts in Law and Society, and also lists hospitality management for Syracuse University under education, according to her LinkedIn page. At Syracuse, she was a member of the Varsity Volleyball team and a scholar/athlete. She graduated from Clyde High School. \nThe News Messenger reports that “She was a volleyball and basketball star at Clyde High School, named to the first-team All-Ohio in both sports. She received a full athletic scholarship to play volleyball at Syracuse University.” \nCNN says that Crooks reached out to the Times after reading another story on Trump and adds that campaign sources say the Trump campaign is drafting a lawsuit against the Times and Palm Beach Post, which posted another woman’s account. \nThe Trump campaign has fired back with an adamant denial of the two accounts in the Times. The statement says: \nThis entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous. To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election. \nIt is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged in this story, and for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all. \nHillary’s communications director released a statement saying, “This disturbing story sadly fits everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women. These reports suggest that he lied on the debate stage and that the disgusting behavior he bragged about in the tape are more than just words.” \nThe Times claimed that Trump himself shouted that “none of this ever took place” to the Times and called the reporter a “disgusting human being.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T13:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T08:48:39.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
