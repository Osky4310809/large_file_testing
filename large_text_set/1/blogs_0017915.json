I am overjoyed,\" he said. \nThe left-handed Miller hit three sixes and three fours. He and new captain Farhaan Behardien put on 51 off 23 balls for the fourth wicket. \nBehardien made 31 not out off 18 balls. \n\"We wanted to give David as many balls as possible and it paid off,\" said Behardien of the decision to move Miller up to number four in the batting order. \nHe also praised Ngidi. \n\"His bowling was outstanding. What a prospect!,\" said the South Africa captain. \nAsela Gunaratne held two catches for Sri Lanka, one a good diving effort to dismiss Theunis de Bruyn at backward point, bowled two steady overs of medium-pace, conceding only 12 runs, and ran out Mangaliso Mosehle with a direct hit from mid-off. \n\"I think the bowlers did pretty well,\" said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews. \n\"We got off to the good start we needed but after that we didn't have any partnerships.\" \nSouth Africa included four international newcomers in batsmen Jon-Jon Smuts and Theunis de Bruyn, wicketkeeper Mangaliso Mosehle and Ngidi. \nSri Lanka had one newcomer in Thikshila de Silva, who was out first ball as a succession of batsmen perished in trying to achieve an ever-increasing run rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T08:35:05.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
