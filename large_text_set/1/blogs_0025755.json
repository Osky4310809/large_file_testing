The season lends itself to that showstopping fashion moment that every star and their stylist hope to achieve. When Thandie Newton headed to Paris last week to see Bertrand Guyon’s latest collection for Schiaparelli, it was clear that she would take the opportunity to select something beautiful from the house to wear during awards season, and at tonight’s SAG Awards Newton didn’t disappoint. \nDonning an embellished tea-length dress from the label’s Fall 2016 show, Newton added a touch of surrealism to the evening. Covered in stars, an embroidered Ferris wheel, and a series of mystical creatures, the look was a playful alternative to the typical black tie code. In keeping with the night’s trend toward sequins and unexpected embellishment, the gown provided visual interest from all angles. The unexpected touch of velvet at the neckline, bejeweled phoenix stitched across the back, and peek of blue from beneath her sleeve, combined to create an ensemble that was wholly original and a breath of fresh air.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T04:20:56.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
