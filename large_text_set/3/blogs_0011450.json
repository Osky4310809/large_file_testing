Adam (@Mayhosadam) March 11, 2017 \nThe Dutch government said it did not want Turkish politicians campaigning among Turkish emigres in the Netherlands, leading President Tayyip Erdogan to brand the fellow NATO member a \"Nazi remnant\". The government also said it does not object to meetings in the Netherlands to give information about the Turkish referendum, \"but these meetings should not add to tensions in our society and everybody who wants to organize a meeting must adhere to instructions from authorities so that public order and security can be guaranteed.\" It said the Turkish government \"does not want to respect the rules in this matter.\" \nMeanwhile, over in Turkey, the Dutch embassy and consulate in Turkey were closed off \"for security reasons\" on Saturday following the latest diplomatic scandal. The residences of the Dutch ambassador, charge d'affaires and consul general were also closed off, according to Reuters. \nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said earlier in a statement that Ankara did not want “the Dutch ambassador, currently on leave, to return to his post for some time.” \n“It has been explained to our counterparts that this grave decision taken against Turkey and the Dutch Turkish community will cause serious problems diplomatically, politically, economically and in other areas,\" the statement said, as cited by Reuters. \nTurkey's president Erdogan is expected to make a statement to the nation momentarily in response to the Dutch \"provocation.\" \nThe unexpected escalation in tensions between the Netherlands and Turkey comes just three days ahead of the critical Dutch general election on March 15, in which the anti-immigration, anti-EU, Freedom Party of Geert Wilders is expected to emerge as the largest party. Today's tensions may boost support for his platform which has seen a modest drop in public approval in recent days.
