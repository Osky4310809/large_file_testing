Prisoners are placed according to their gender as recognised by UK law - usually stated on a birth certificate. \nIf the prisoner has a \"gender recognition certificate\", the Prison Service is legally required to move them to the prison of their gender. \nIn November of last year, the government announced it would re-examine its policy on transgender prisoners following the death of Vikki Thompson, who was an inmate in a male prison in Leeds. \nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning \nIn January, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman recommended that where a transgender prisoner is sent should be based on an individual assessment of their needs and the possibility of them being with their acquired gender. \nJohn Pilley, also known as Jane Anne, made legal history in 1999 when he became the first inmate in England and Wales to be granted permission for a sex change operation. \nPilley was serving life for the attempted murder and kidnapping of a woman taxi driver. It was later reported he decided to become a man again and was waiting to have his second operation on the NHS. \nAbout 80 transgender people are believed to be in prison in England and Wales.
