That they are top of the league now isn’t a great surprise.

He was a very special manager who found a very special axis with the players, in terms of communication. \n“It was always tense between the coach and the players. Mostly he was pushing us together as a group and was always at the front of the group, protecting us. He was our leader and we went for that away from the tactics and football circumstances. \n“We trained day-in, day-out and this is something when you work so long together you have to have a groove and create a good ­atmosphere. I think that’s so ­important these days if you want to work as a manager. Chelsea are loving life under new management (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n“And he did that. But sometimes it’s not easy when you have 20 egos, 20 individuals as players, sometimes one or two can create a bit of trouble because they’re not happy. \n“These days at Chelsea it looks as if it works, but last year it seems like it wasn’t the case — the players and the coach weren’t always going in the same direction. And that’s why I think it didn’t work and Conte now I think he has found that key. \n“Sometimes as a coach it’s difficult to do that over a long period. ­Sometimes you lose it a bit. Even if it’s just a few percentage and ­sometimes it is time to have a change and have your input at a new club. \n“A new challenge for yourself and the players. I think this is a totally natural process in a football team. \n“If you see he’s not good enough or this player isn’t good enough – it’s just sometimes small things aren’t like maybe what they were two years ago. Mourinho won three league titles in his two spells as Chelsea manager (Photo: Getty) \n“So that’s why also when you come back to a club where you were already successful, sometimes it’s questionable. With him it didn’t really work, especially at the end and they went different way. \n“But Conte is fresh, it’s simple football, clear football, very understandable football. He’s very competitive and when I talk to him it’s like Italian ­football, very organised, very disciplined and controlled.” \nBallack is convinced Conte – who has made a start equally as impressive as Mourinho when he took over at Chelsea in 2004 – will build on the lead and win the title. \nHe added: “The team is playing to their strengths, making very few mistakes, conceding not many goals. That’s the key if you want to win a title – to be solid.
