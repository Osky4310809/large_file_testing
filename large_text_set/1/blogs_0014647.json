As the new Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Holland has already owned both sides of the role (see: Captain America: Civil War ), and as a young actor, has carried himself impeccably - from appearing in hilarious late-night sketches to doing real good through charity work. \nIn today's Tom Holland showcase, we learn that the new Spider-Man has the strange powers of another Marvel superhero: Squirrel Girl ! A video posted by ✌️ (@tomholland2013) on Jan 16, 2017 at 9:01am PST \nIn all seriousness though: having a gang of squirrels swarm you in a public park is pretty much a nightmare scenario for a lot of people. Holland handled it like a true hero - or at least edited out the part where he screamed and ran away. We're betting it's the former. \nFacing down a mob of squirrels? This new Spider-Man continues to impress. \nIn Spider-Man: Homecoming, a young Peter Parker/Spider-Man ( Tom Holland ), who made his sensational debut in Captain America: Civil War, begins to navigate his newfound identity as the web-slinging super hero. Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter returns home, where he lives with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.). Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine – distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man – but when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as a new villain, everything that Peter holds most important will be threatened. \nThe cast features Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Tyne Daly, Bokeem Woodbine, with Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. . It also includes Jon Favreau, Martin Starr, Kenneth Choi, Michael Mando, Selenis Leyva, Isabella Amara, Jorge Lendeborg, Jr., JJ Totah, Hannibal Buress, and Jacob Batalon. \nThe film is being directed by Jon Watts ( Cop Car ), based on a screenplay by Jonathan Goldstein & John Francis Daley ( Vacation reboot) and Jon Watts & Christopher Ford and Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers. \nThe film is produced by Marvel boss Kevin Feige and former Sony boss Amy Pascal. Louis D’Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Patricia Whitcher, Jeremy Latcham, and Stan Lee are serving as Executive Producers. \nMore Spider-Man: Homecoming : Domestic Trailer / International Trailer / First Look at Shocker / Iron Man Cameo Revealed / SPIDER-MAN HAS WINGS! / Jacob Batalon Reveals Role / Will Liz Allan Be Peter Parker's Love Interest? \nDoctor Strange is now in theaters;   – May 5, 2017; Spider-Man: Homecoming – July 7, 2017; Thor: Ragnarok – November 3, 2017; Black Panther – February 16, 2018; Avengers: Infinity War – May 4, 2018; Ant-Man and the Wasp – July 6, 2018; and Captain Marvel on March 8, 2019. \nSpider-Man: Homecoming will be released on July 7, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T18:45:57.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
