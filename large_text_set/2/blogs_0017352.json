Here’s how you can make your own with just a few supplies and a little effort. Advertisement \nFor this project, you’ll need a wire closet shelf, two folding legs or locker shelves, zip ties, teacup hooks, and auto-grade carpet (optional). Measure the shelf and legs to make sure they fit in your trunk and trim them down with a hacksaw if they’re too big. You want the legs to give the shelf a slight incline towards the front of your car to keep items from rolling off. THen add the teacup hooks to the rear row seat back at the level you want the shelf to hang and zip tie the legs to the shelf. You also have the option of covering the shelf with carpet to make it look nicer, which also helps hide valuable items on the floor of your trunk. \nThis trunk shelf won’t work for every car, but if it fits in yours, it’s an easy way to get more space for all your stuff.
