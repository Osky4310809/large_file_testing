It‚Äôs the second-lowest in the NFL, only ahead of the Los Angeles Chargers. \nThe average carryover is more than $9 million ‚Äî but that number is skewed because the Cleveland Browns have more than $50 million to spend and the Jacksonville Jaguars have nearly $40 million. \nHere‚Äôs why the Rams additional salary cap space is so low based on numbers from last season ( via Turf Show Times ): \n‚ÄúInstead of carrying over the additional salary cap space, the Rams elected to use [the money] to offset incentives earned in 2015, but not yet accounted for on their salary cap. The end result is the exact same amount of available salary cap space as if instead the Rams had rolled over all of the remaining room from 2015.‚Äù \nLast season, the Rams had a little less than a million dollars available in rollover money.
