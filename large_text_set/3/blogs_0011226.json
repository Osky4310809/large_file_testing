Jordan for the lead role in the reboot, but that the studio is some way off concrete casting decisions. What we do know is that the Wachowski siblings, who wrote and directed the original and its two sequels, are not involved — at least not yet.\nInstead, Zak Penn is said to be currently in talks to write it. Penn is best known for his script work on several superhero movies, including on X-Men: The Last Stand , The Avengers , and Elektra. \nStay tune for more information. In the meantime, watch Neo dodge bullets again below.\n\nIn other news, here’s everything we know so far about Game of Thrones season 7 .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T14:23:58.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
