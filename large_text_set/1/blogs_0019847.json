"text": "“That is what makes this league so exciting and special” Swansea boss Paul Clement \nLlorente headed in a second four minutes later with Anfield still in shock before Roberto Firmino pulled one back with a header of his own. \nThe Kop ace then scored a great equaliser on the half volley in the 69th minute as Liverpool looked set for another memorable comeback win. \nBut as the hosts pushed forward, Swansea struck on the break five minutes later with the impressive Tom Carroll waltzing into the area. \nRagnar Klavan cut in but the Liverpool defender’s tackle only guided the ball to Gylfi Sigurdsson and he found the net for Swansea’s first ever league win at Anfield. \n“When you are joining club in this position of course you have to look to see if there are positive signs – and I saw them here, especially from the manager,” said debutant Martin Olsson. \n“I knew it was not over, that there was good potential to stay up, and I think we showed what we can do when we work as a close unit.” \nLiverpool don’t have much to be positive about after this as their title hopes took a huge blow and Kop boss Jurgen Klopp has revealed they have suffered setbacks in the transfer window too. \nGETTY Swansea boss Paul Clement was delighted with beating Liverpool \nKlopp said: “It is not that we don’t want to bring players in - we do. But the thing is, the players we want because we think they help us, the clubs don’t sell. \n“It is not about money in this situation, it is the winter transfer window. \n“Clubs are saying ‘no we have half a year to go, we cannot find another player like this, we prefer to take money in the summer, than a few pound more in the winter than whatever’. So it is pretty easy. \n“It’s tight, it’s close, we know that, but if the right decision is not possible in signing the right player, then you cannot make the wrong transfer.” \nJoel Matip made his return as a late substitute after FIFA finally cleared him to play while the Africa Cup of Nations is going on. \nThe Cameroon international also featured for Liverpool’s Under-23s against Ipswich yesterday as Klopp tries to get him ready for Wednesday’s EFL Cup semi-final second leg clash against Southampton. \nLIVERPOOL (4-3-3): Mignolet 6; Clyne 6, Lovren 6, Klavan 5, Milner 6; Wijnaldum 5 (Matip 90), Henderson 6, Can 5 (Origi 69, 5); Lallana 6, FIRMINO 7, Coutinho 5 (Sturridge 57, 5).
