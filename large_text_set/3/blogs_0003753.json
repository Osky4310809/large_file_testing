Huh, who would have thought that? \nYou don't jump off a boat onto a swimming moose and ride it around without copious usage of the term \"bro.\" \n\"Yo bro, that a moose?\" \"That is a moose bro.\" \"Bro… you should ride that moose, bro.\" \"Br !\" \"Bro!\" At this point, Bro Two heeds Bro One's advice and leaps from the deck of their fuck-boat onto a clearly scared and swimming moose. \"Bro, I'm doing it, bro!\" \n\"Bro,\" yells Bro One. \"I love you, bro!\" \nWhile as you can see from the video, the transcript above doesn't exactly match what was said in the video, but you damn well know that's what they're thinking. In fact, the video's audio is muffled, so the only real thing you can hear is the bellow of one bro to another while they take in the sight of their buddy proudly riding the swimming moose with his arm up in the air John Bender style. \n\"I've never seen anything more awesome,\" he shouts between laughs. \nBro One and Bro Two are, in this case, Jaysun Pinkerton and Bradley Crook, of Fort St. John, BC, and the video was taken in the summer of 2014 at Tuchodi Lakes in BC. For a year, the bros thought they got away with their moose riding and it was probably a killer bar story but in 2015 the footage was posted on Youtube by an account called Wolftracker TV and it went viral—garnering over two million views. \nAfter being shared wildly the video was quickly flagged to the BC conservation office and after a year long investigation into the clip the pair were charged. Initially, the two faced charges of hunting big game that was swimming, harassing wildlife using a boat, and attempting to capture wildlife, but, on Friday, it was announced that the two were convicted of harassing wildlife—the bros plead guilty. \nBetween the two of them the bros will pony up $8,000 for the stunt with $4,000 going to fines and another $4,000 going to Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation. David Vince, who is with the B.C. Conservation Service, said, when talking to the CBC , that the action was \"the ultimate form of harassment.\" \n\"You can see that the moose is struggling with that fellow on her back,\" said Vince. \"You can see the fright in her eyes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T02:08:06.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
