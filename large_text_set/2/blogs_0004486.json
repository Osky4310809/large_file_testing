Where was she all this while?\" asked Janak Gamage, admiration writ large on his face. The former Sri Lankan cricketer, who is currently coaching the Thailand Women team, was observing the tournament opener of the 2016 Asia Cup T20 from the sidelines when Mansi Joshi's international debut left him spellbound. Whether Gamage was in attendance to follow the progress of his ex team - Bangladesh Women - or to pick up notes for his present team's upcoming assignment against the Asian giants is anybody's guess, but for the retired pacer, Joshi stood out amongst other wicket-takers and game-changers. \"She got good bounce today, almost my height. That's very good for a (rookie) bowler.\" The 23-year-old Haryana pacer returned the following morning to send back both the Thailand openers cheaply in successive overs of her opening spell to create an early stutter. Sitting in the makeshift dressing room, Gamage had his eyes fixed on the action in the middle and frequent tips to pass on to his young pupils. Her figures of 3-0-8-2 earned Joshi the Player of the Match award in just her second game at the highest level, albeit a non-Twenty20 International against the hosts. The next opportunity did not come until the inconsequential game against Nepal, where Joshi earned many more admirers - this time with her athleticism and a splendid low return catch in the follow-through. The youngster was overlooked for the all-important final against Pakistan, with the defending champions opting for the experienced duo of Jhulan Goswami and Shikha Pandey. That had, in fact, been the story of her brief fling with the national side thus far. The promise she showed and the impressions she left in the 2015-16 domestic season and the senior camp that followed earned her the maiden call-up for the T20I home series against West Indies. But against an opposition as strong as the reigning world champions and a wicket as placid as that of Mulapadu's, Joshi was only serving as the 12th man. The impromptu hit out in the nets immediately after India conceded the second game in a row might have got the onlookers speculating about the probable debut, but the rookie was content knowing that she was in the reckoning. \"I've always believed whatever happens is for a reason; I was very positive,\" Joshi told Cricbuzz. \"I knew that my chance will come and I promised myself that whenever I do get the opportunity, I will have to prove myself and the management right.\" ***It's hard to recall when exactly she got hooked to cricket, having grown up in various corners of the erstwhile Uttar Pradesh due to the transferable nature of her mother's job. Like any other eight-nine-year-old playing with her uncles and cousins on the streets of Tehri - her first memory of picking up the sport - Joshi started off naturally as a bowler. \"That's what the brothers would ask me to do,\" she chuckles. \"But I would just throw the ball then. When I went to the academy, I learnt the art of bowling. I wanted to bat too, but I didn't know technique at all,\" adds Joshi who idolises Sachin Tendulkar and admires Dale Steyn for his aggression. The choice to make cricket a profession was hers alone and family's support was never an issue. \"My dad's friend took me to the first academy in Roorkee. He got a bat and leg guards for me.\" Joshi started formal practice at the age of 14, under the guidance of Jitendar Pal Singh. \"(Jitender) sir took me to Yamunanagar in Haryana, for district (tournament) and I got selected for the state team same year. I played Under-19 and senior the same year.\" The state debut also meant Joshi had to forgo the 10th standard board exams but she has little regrets. \"I did 10th and 12th private (through correspondence),\" she states nonchalantly. \"Thankfully my family has been very supportive; they never said anything.\" With the benefit of hindsight, Joshi admits she wasted precious years in Roorkee. The understanding that she needs to have a more professional approach to realise her long-term goal of playing for India came as she rose through the ranks and found competition only getting tougher at every step of the ladder. Fortunately, that coincided with her mother's transfer to Dehradun, where as an Under-19 cricketer, her capabilities were spotted by her current coach Virender Singh Rautela. \"I must have made some 20-odd only in that match but I guess he spotted the talent that I could bat. He then offered me to move to Dehradun.\" Joshi has been practicing for the past three years under the former club cricketer at the St. Joseph's School Academy at Rajpura road. \"Frankly, I couldn't practice that well in Roorkee also because Jitender sir was a school PTI and he had a lot more on his plate than just cricket coaching. \"When I played under-19, I was a kid and there wasn't any one as such who could guide properly. But for the last three years I have been very determined to make India debut. I left all aside - friends, studies, everything. And my game has seen a lot of improvement. I was just a bowler three years ago, now I am an all-rounder - an opening batsman and an opening bowler as well. My game saw massive improvement in Dehradun. (In) Roorkee, I admit, I wasted some time; I was a little immature. But since coming to Dehradun, cricket has been my sole focus.\" Thus began the transition from mindless hitting to copybook batting. From a No. 6 to an opener, Rautela honed the batsman in Joshi. \"You can put it this way, Jitender sir showed me the destination and Virender sir was the one who taught me how to walk towards it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:13:27.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
