That's because Democratic women are wearing white to the big event to make a big statement, without even saying a word. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has championed the #WomenWearWhite effort, taking pictures at Capitol Hill with Democratic women, all wearing white. She said the move is \"in support of women's rights, in spite of a president who doesn't.\" Tonight, our Democratic #WomenWearWhite in support of women's rights -- in spite of a @POTUS who doesn't! pic.twitter.com/kKJpfV5iUE \n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 28, 2017 Most Popular And other women in Congress also posted photos, explaining that they're putting up a united front against Trump. . @RepAnnieKuster & I are among those wearing white for tonight's #JointSession to oppose GOP rollback of women's progress! #WomenWearWhite pic.twitter.com/Dl6QkkbDnC \n— Rep.

Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) February 28, 2017 NBC News points out that the color is a tribute to the women's suffrage movement, which often had participants wear white to symbolize purity. In fact, Hillary Clinton wore a white pantsuit when she accepted her party's nomination at the Democratic National Convention. (She also wore white at President Trump's inauguration.) \"We wear white to unite against any attempts by the Trump Administration to roll back the incredible progress women have made in the last century, and we will continue to support the advancement of all women,\" Rep. Lois Frankel, who runs the Democratic party's Women's Working Group, said in a statement. That group features 66 Democratic women, according to CNN , so Trump will have a hard time not noticing in the crowd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:22:50.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
