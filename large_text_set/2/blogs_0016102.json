AP Photo/Aaron Favila MANILA, Philippines — The government would resume peace talks with communist rebels if they agree to stop ambushing soldiers, extortion activities and the burning of properties, Malacañang said Monday. Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said there should be “compelling reasons” to continue the negotiations, which were terminated by President Rodrigo Duterte this month after the rebels staged a series of attacks against government forces. “While it is understandable that suspicions linger about the motives of the parties on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum, some ‘compelling reasons’ need to be provided for talks to resume,” Abella said in a statement. “Considering the unprecedented goodwill the president has shown, these actions from NDF (National Democratic Front) may provide compelling reason and could put at ease, to some extent, the apprehension of the military and the administration. After all when guns are silent we can better listen to each other,” he added. The NDF represents the communist rebels in the peace negotiations with the government. Abella said the communists should agree to a bilateral ceasefire and stop the collection of the so-called revolutionary tax, the ambushes on military personnel, the burning of properties and other provocative and hostile actions. “We need to take in good faith the president's vision for a peaceful, just and inclusively prosperous Philippines. He has already taken the first steps forward. We wait for NDF to respond,” he said. The peace negotiations between the government and the NDF were scrapped after the communists insisted on their demand to free 400 rebels whom they claim to be political prisoners. Duterte rejected the demand, saying it is similar to the grant of amnesty. The disagreement prompted the communists and subsequently the government to call off their respective unilateral ceasefires. On February 4, Duterte announced that he is terminating the peace talks and ordered the security forces to arrest the NDF consultants who joined the negotiations. He has also described the NDF, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and their armed wing the New People’s Army (NPA) as “terrorists.” On Sunday, the CPP ordered the NPA to free the six soldiers and policemen they are holding captive as a “positive gesture” for the resumption of the peace talks. The group also reiterated its support for a bilateral ceasefire agreement. “The revolutionary forces are encouraged by the previous statements of President Duterte that all political prisoners will be released within 48 hours once the bilateral ceasefire agreement is signed,” the CPP said in a statement. “We anticipate that negotiations concerning the terms of reference of a bilateral ceasefire agreement will be most difficult. The revolutionary forces are bound by principle to assert the withdrawal of the AFP’s operating troops from areas under the sway of the revolutionary government,” it added. The disagreement over jailed communist rebels was also the contentious issue that led to the collapse of the peace talks during the previous administration.
