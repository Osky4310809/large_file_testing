She shared a secret of roadside beet marketing: \n\"First rule in roadside beet sales, put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'\" \n\"That's cool,\" Nate responded. \nShe also revealed that \"I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat... \n\"Thats awesome,\" said Nate. \nAfter her tweet went viral, Caroline told Nate about the prank. He was a good sport, she said. \n\"He thought it was hilarious and that it was cool that it was getting so many retweets,\" she said. Video: Rainn Wilson of The Office Parodies Angus T. Jones \nAngus T. Jones of \"Two and a Half Men\" recently released a video bashing the show that made him famous, and Rainn Wilson did a parody, as a way to promote the final season of \"The Office.\" Gillian Pensavalle has the comparison.
