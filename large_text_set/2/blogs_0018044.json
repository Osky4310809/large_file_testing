Following a communication failure, when it was unable to establish contact with the Indian aircraft, Cologne air traffic control officials alerted the German Air Force, which in turn scrambled two fighter jets. \nThe Jet Airways flight 9W-118, which left on Thursday (the incident happened three days back), was going from Mumbai to London and was flying over Cologne city in Germany. German Air Force fighters first located the plane and thereafter escorted the Jet Airways flight till the flight managed to establish contact with the ATC. Thereafter, the emergency was called off by the authorities concerned and the Indian aircraft was allowed to continue to London. \nA statement by Jet Airways stated that contact between the flight was briefly lost and that the German Air Force, concerned over the safety of the flight, deployed its fighter planes only as a precautionary measure. \nYou may also like to watch this video \n“Contact between Jet Airways flight 9W 118, from Mumbai to London Heathrow, on February 16, 2017, and the local ATC was briefly lost while flying over German airspace.
