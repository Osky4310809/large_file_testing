By: FE Online | Published:  14 AM Earlier in her rally in Auraiya, Dimple took a straight shot at PM Modi and his demonetisation move, saying, it hurt farmers a lot and they had to bear the loss. (Source: PTI) \nUP polls 2017: Dimple Yadav, wife of Uttar Pradesh chief minster Akhilesh Yadav on Monday took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) in spectacular fashion with a majestic Bollywood style. While addressing a political rally in Auraiya, Dimple taunted PM Modi with lyrics of a very famous song from a super hit 80’s films ‘Laawaris’. She said “Mere angne mein tumhara kya kaam hai.” (Here in my veranda (patio), what is your purpose – in effect, it means ‘keep out of my business’). This was a very old, but extremely popular song by Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan that still manages to move people. Further in her speech, Dimple urged the people to vote for Akhikesh Yadav in order to see more development in the state. Dimple, who is also an MP from Kannauj, wants the public to give Akhilesh another stint in power as the CM, saying he has always worked for the people of UP. \nClearly pleased with her initial statement and the reaction it elicited, Dimple waxed eloquent and said, “Jo hai naam wala, wahi to badnaam hai” (Those who are famous are the ones who are infamous). Further raising the ante against PM Modi, Dimple said that people do ‘Mann ki Baat’ for hours, but never do ‘Kaam ki Baat’ (Talk about work). \nEarlier in her rally in Auraiya, Dimple took a straight shot at PM Modi and his demonetisation move, saying, it hurt farmers a lot and they had to bear the loss. She also said that women who used to save money without letting their husband know are now suffering as these currency notes have now been scrapped. She asked, “How will women get their money back? They will again have to start collecting the amount from zero”. \nYou might also want to see this: \nThe Kannauj MP also said that PM has promised to distribute 5 crore gas connection, but no one has got any gas connection so far. As far as teh Samajwadi Party government is concerned, she said that it will distribute cycles to girls of class 10 and 11; and in the future, “we will also work on home delivery of ration to the pregnant women.” \nWhile addressing a roadshow in Lakhimpur she acclaimed the performance of SP and that her party had lived up to its promise and also distributed laptops to youths. Praising SP government’s work, she had stated, the ruling party gave DIAL 100 and also the 1090 for women. Dimple had also assured the people of UP that her husband’s government is working towards providing 24-hour electricity across the state.
