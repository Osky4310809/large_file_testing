On Friday March 17th, in time for a traditional weekend churrasco , or barbecue, the federal police accused some of the country’s biggest meat producers of bribing health inspectors to turn a blind eye to grubby practices. These include repackaging beef past its sell-by date, making turkey ham out of soyabeans rather than actual birds and overuse of potentially harmful additives. The police operation, dubbed Weak Flesh, could reduce Brazil’s meat exports, worth $13bn a year, and damage its two big global meat producers, JBS and BRF. \nTwo days later the president, Michel Temer, treated 27 diplomats from the country’s main export markets to prime Brazilian cuts at a steakhouse (pictured) in the capital, Brasília. Nevertheless, straight after that China, the European Union (EU), Chile and South Korea, which together consume a third of Brazilian meat sold abroad, said they would ban some or all imports from Brazil until it can allay misgivings about its inspection regime. The reactions from China and Chile provoked particular anguish. Unlike the EU, which has restricted products only from the 21 plants that are under investigation, they have barred all Brazilian meat from crossing their borders until further notice.\n  Investor fears of a widespread embargo quickly kicked in. By March 20th shares in JBS, the world’s biggest beef exporter, and in BRF, the largest producer of poultry globally, had lost a sixth of their market value. Like other firms involved in the affair, both companies deny wrongdoing. Their share prices have since partially recovered, helped by South Korea’s subsequent decision to lift its ban. Most of the meat-production plants under investigation belong to much smaller rivals. Only one of dozens of plants owned by BRF is under suspicion, and the same is true for JBS. Yet the damage to the firms’ reputations may take a long time to repair.\nThe effort is under way: Brazilian authorities and the country’s butchers are rushing to reassure customers at home and abroad. The suspected slaughterhouses make up a tiny fraction of 5,000-odd such establishments in the country, the industry’s defenders note. Only 33 agriculture-ministry officials were fingered by the police, out of a bureaucracy of some 11,000.\nIn fact, both JBS and BRF have already clamped down on over-close relationships with officialdom inside their businesses. Such steps were judged essential as they embarked on successful global expansions during the past decade. These days, their products must get past keen-eyed foreign quality inspectors, their executives say, not just Brazilian ones.\nIt makes little sense for either company to jeopardise hard-won, lucrative foreign markets by cutting corners at home. Both companies know full well how long it takes to rebuild consumers’ trust in the wake of a scandal; some Europeans are still sniffy about British beef 19 years after Britain stamped out mad-cow disease. America let in Brazilian beef only last year, after two decades of talks. \nNonetheless, the episode will almost certainly postpone the impending flotation of JBS’s international business in New York, which was expected to raise 10.5bn reais ($3.4bn), and of BRF’s halal arm in London, aimed at raising $1.5bn. It may also hobble BRF’s return to profit from its first-ever annual loss in 2016, caused by weak domestic demand and high prices for the corn it feeds to poultry. The two giants, as well as other Brazilian exporters, may need to slash prices or risk losing substantial chunks of market share. It is all too easy to fall foul of foreign governments’ weak stomach for food scares.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T09:35:41.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
