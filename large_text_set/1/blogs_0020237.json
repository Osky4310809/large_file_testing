I’m probably gonna go eat Jimmy John’s after this, like ‘Raindrop, drop top’… where have I heard that before?” \nLee says that since OG Maco (also a Quality Records signee) blew up via memes with 2014’s “U Guessed It,” he’s made concerted efforts to go viral as part of his marketing strategy. “Oh hell yeah [we try to cultivate memes],” he says. “We’re like, ‘Who made this meme?! We need to get them this record.’ It’s really a promotional tool now — we didn’t have to pay anybody, but there’s a business out there for it.” He traces the impact of memes to seeing snipes (posters) on the street in his early days as a promoter. “You’d say, ‘Oh damn, this record’s about to be hot,’ because you’d seen it a lot of places. This is before the Internet.” \nThe timing of the song’s exploding popularity was also a combination of old-school and new-school marketing — sure, it was tied to going viral on Twitter, but it also happened over the holidays, traditionally a boom time for song and album sales. “It really popped between Thanksgiving and Christmas … I think because the kids were, like, on break,” adds Lee. “A lot of times it’s the kids that really move the culture.” A combination of increasingly prolific meme-ing and the holidays (read: iTunes gift cards) meant the song’s sales almost quadrupled over Christmas (digital sales rose 380% to 116,000 the week ending Dec. 29). On New Year’s Eve, the turn-up ready single was added to 12,000 YouTube playlists — one portion of the song’s almost 40 million streams that helped it finally land at No. 1 on the Hot 100, the week ending Jan. 5, 2017. \n4. The Co-Sign Just three days later, Donald Glover called “Boujee”“the best song ever” during his Golden Globes ­acceptance speech, helping it become the top gainer across metrics on the Jan. 28 chart. “I was like, ‘Oh shit,’” says Lee. “Middle America, the world — they all know now.” During the ceremony, there were 175,000 mentions of “Bad and Boujee” or Migos — more than, for example, there were about Ryan Gosling. By Jan. 11 (three days after the Globes), the video had 100 million views on YouTube — currently it’s at over 137 million. \n“It’s a very 21st century type of popularity,” adds Alloca, who sees “Black Beatles” as a strong comparison. “They’re both songs that became much bigger than themselves — they’re part of a movement, and really driven by people’s creative expression and enjoyment.” He adds that at least via YouTube, they’ve sowed the seeds for future success: “Migos started 2016 with about 280,000 subscribers, and now they’re at over 800,000 — they’ve increased the reach as soon as they drop their next song.”“Bad and Boujee” is atop the Hot 100 for a second week with the chart dated Feb. 4, breaking the record for the most weeks (this is its fifth) as the chart’s top streaming gainer. \nMigos will be looking to expand their reach even more with their new album Culture , which drops this Friday, Jan. 27 — but Lee sees some reason to celebrate already. “Two years ago there was all this Internet gossip about Migos and The Beatles , then Rae Sremmurd comes with this song called ‘Black Beatles,’ that was up on the charts forever. Then, boom — the Migos, who originally had all the Beatles stuff, we come and we take down the Rae Sremmurd record,” he says, laughing. “You can’t make this stuff up, you know?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:57:24.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
