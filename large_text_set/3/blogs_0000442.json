There’s got to be a coming together,” a senior administration official said. \nOn his part, the official said Trump is envisioning a proposal to allow non-violent illegal immigrants to stay and work in the country with one stipulation: there would be no pathway to citizenship. \nSuch a proposal would stop short of the measure proposed in the failed Gang of Eight bill from 2013, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

In February, he directed the federal government to more aggressively arrest and deport “criminal aliens” who disregard the “rule of law and pose a threat” to American citizens.
