Controlling Heated Debates,Tackling Sports’ Toughest Topics \n“TV is changing in terms of how we are consuming sports … I think that’s why the debate shows work and this is just the beginning,” Qerim tells TheWrap Debbie Emery | March 30, 2017 @ 5:35 PM Photo by Ben Solomon / ESPN Images \nIf Molly Qerim can control “First Take” analysts Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman, and survive former side-kick Skip Bayless — then there’s nothing she can’t handle. \nThe ESPN host took the reins from Cari Champion 18 months ago, and since then she’s proven that she’s not to be taken lightly. \nWhether it’s keeping her outspoken colleagues in check or forwarding the sports conversation to prove that she can keep up with the big boys, Qerim has more than earned her stripes on the high-energy debate show. Also Read: ESPN Names Samantha Ponder, Suzy Kolber and Trey Wingo as New NFL Studio Hosts \n“First Take” recently took a trip out west to Los Angeles from the show’s usual Bristol, Connecticut studio. TheWrap caught up with Qerim to discuss her expanding role, the evolution of the show, and some of the most-talked about stories in sports. \nTheWrap: Has your role hosting “First Take” changed since Skip left for Fox Sports 1 last September? Molly Qerim: Obviously, this year has changed in terms of Skip and Max joining, but I think now my main role and job description — as it always has been — is to continue to move the conversation forward, to play devil’s advocate, to bring up points of order. Primarily, it is to be the eyes and ears — listen to the guys and get them go deeper or look something from a different angle. The only time my job is hard is when we are in an intense debate and have to go to a commercial break. Advertisers pay our bills! \nWas it difficult adjusting to Max joining the show just six months after you did? I felt like as soon as I met Max that I’d always known him, it was natural and organic. I revel in his intelligence, he is highly cerebral, he is well-read on so many different subjects and has a different way of looking at sports than Stephen A. I like having the dichotomy of them. We feel like a team and we are collaborating well, the show is evolving and everything is tracking in the right direction. Also Read: ESPN's Molly Qerim on New England Patriots Trump Snub: 'That's Their Prerogative' \nIs it easier to work with him than Skip? I wouldn’t call it easier, it is just different. Skip and I were also very close, he is so passionate about his craft. “First Take” was his baby and he essentially created that show and helped it evolve from “Cold Pizza.” When he left, I was definitely disappointed as we had a good rapport on air and I had just got adjusted. \nThen Max just stepped right in and there was no awkwardness on- or off-camera. I can’t say one is easier than the other, they are just two entirely different people. \nWhile “First Take” was ahead of the game, debate shows like Skip’s new “Undisputed” seem to be the new trend in sports media — why do you think that’s so? TV is changing in terms of how we are consuming sports. Appointment viewing no longer exists, as between social media and the internet, people already have the news and can get the highlights — so now people want the opinions. I think that’s why the debate shows work and this is just the beginning, we are going to be seeing more and more of that. I look at it as a positive as we must be doing something right. \nLaVar Ball [the father of three of L.A.’s hottest basketball players] has been in the center of his own media firestorm lately by clashing with LeBron James. You recently had him on the show — how was he in person? He is hilarious, that man is TV gold. When I was sat in between him and Stephen A., I was just dying. It was two big personalities going at each other and I told Stephen A. he had met his match. He is very likable in person, and he has a lot of personality. \nDo you think he was out of order talking about LeBron’s sons? I think his point was that LeBron’s kids have to live up to LeBron, where his sons (Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo) don’t have those expectations of being in the limelight of a celebrity parent. I personally wouldn’t be talking about other people’s children or family … I get what he was saying, but I would have left it alone. Molly Qerim/ESPN Also Read: Colin Kaepernick to Scrap Protest, Will Stand For National Anthem Next Season \nOne topic that’s been a source of endless debate Colin Kaepernick first not kneeling for the national anthem and now talk of him being blackballed in the NFL — do you think that’s true? If Kaepernick is trying to become a backup quarterback and we’re seeing guys like Mark Sanchez and Geno Smith being picked ahead him, then you can argue that he is being blackballed. But if he is trying to be a starting QB, and being overlooked for guys like Tony Romo and Jay Cutler who are more proven than him, I can’t look at that as a political situation. \nIf all things were equal, and there was another player with the same talent and record, then I think owners might shy away from because they wouldn’t want the hoopla or the negativity that could come from him. If that’s the case, then it’s unfortunate. But if he’s good enough on the field, then people are going to take him either way. Rick Ross and Molly Qerim/ESPN \nWhat topic has really gotten you fired up recently? I am really irked by healthy NBA players resting, I really don’t understand it. Players in the past have played all season for years. I just don’t love it. I feel like it hurts the integrity and competitiveness of the game. It’s got nothing to do with the TV partners, it’s about cheating the fans. You can’t have LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving all sitting out if they are healthy. \nESPN announced last week that Sam Ponder and Suzy Kolber are among the hosts joining, what do you think of the growing number of women in prominent sports media roles? I love it — it wasn’t that long ago when women weren’t allowed in locker rooms, now we have them in front offices, coaching and calling games. I truly believe that ESPN has been in the forefront in terms of the diversity in front of the camera and improving the balance between men and women. \n\n“First Take” airs daily on ESPN at 10 a.m. 16 Biggest Sports Tear-Jerkers of 2016, From the Chicago Cubs to Muhammad Ali (Photos) \nChicago Cubs fans cried with happiness – and Cleveland Indian fans from broken hearts – when the team broke a 108-year drought and the curse of a smelly goat to win the World Series Game 7 victory that will go down in baseball history. Amid the celebrations, diehard Cubs fan Bill Murray cried, chugged champagne ... and drunkenly interviewed Cubs general manager Theo Epstein in the locker room. Getty Images \nThe world appeared to stop to honor \"The Greatest\" when Muhammad Ali died on June 3 at age 74. President Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Billy Crystal and Bryant Gumbel were among those who paid tribute to the boxing legend in a star-filled funeral held in his home city of Louisville, Kentucky, as thousands of mourners filled the streets. Getty Images \nNew England Patriots fans sobbed -- and the rest of the NFL cheered -- when Tom Brady threw in the towel in his fight against the Deflategate suspension. The QB sat out four games ... and then went on to lead his team to the clinch the AFC East for the eighth consecutive year. Who's crying now, Roger Goodell? Getty Images \nThe Rams' return to L.A. sparked tears of joy from patience football-starved fans ... until they actually saw them play. Jubilation quickly turned to frustration as first round draft pick Jared Goff spent most of the season sat on the bench and head coach Jeff Fisher was fired after a a devastating 42-14 home loss to the Atlanta Falcons. Oh well, there's always next season -- or the one after that. Getty Images \nThe wasn't a dry eye in the house when legendary announcer Vin Scully called his last L.A. Dodgers game in September. And after 67 years, Scully couldn't hold back the emotion pouring from the press box at Chavez Ravine. “There is no more important broadcaster in the history of baseball than Vin Scully,” filmmaker Ken Burns told TheWrap at the time. Getty Images \nRyan Lochte prompted tears of shame from the IOC and America as a nation when he confessed to making up a story about being robbed at gunpoint with fellow Olympic swimmers during the Rio Summer Games. The gold medal-winner was banned from the sport for 10 months ... and went on to compete on Season 23 of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" Getty Images \nIf tears could be rainbow-colored, then they would epitomize the reaction to \"NBA on TNT\" reporter Craig Sager's death from leukemia on Dec. 15 at age 65. The beloved sportscaster melted even the coldest of hearts (we're looking at you, Coach Popovich) with his lively courtside banter and bright suits. Getty Images \nTalk about going out on top. Some thought Peyton Manning should have hung his helmet up a few neck surgeries ago -- not the Papa John's pitchman himself. No. 18 returned for one more run, and with a great defense, lead the Denver Broncos to the promised land. Cut the water works. \nBill Simmons' fans have had a rocky few years, and 2016 was no exception. This year, the Sports Guy got himself a new website and even a weekly talk show on HBO. Great, right? Well, Simmons barely writes for The Ringer and his \"Any Given Wednesday\" was canceled after just four months . Maybe ESPN is hiring? \nThe knee that shook the world. Colin Kaepernick wasn't even the starting San Francisco 49ers QB when he began one of the most infamous sporting events protests in history. Kaepernick decided early this season he'd no longer stand for the national anthem when played before NFL games. Cut to: a nation (even more) divided. \nThe Internet didn't shed many tears over Skip Bayless jumping ship from ESPN's \"First Take\" for the much smaller Fox Sports 1, though surely someone was sad to see the polarizing personality bid Bristol adieu, right? Executives? The Bayless clan? Anyone? Alright, give us a break, it was a big move and indicative of a troubling trend over at the Worldwide Leaders in Sports. \nLook, Cleveland, you didn't get the World Series Trophy this year, but you did come away with an NBA Championship. That's a pretty good silver (actually, it's gold) lining. When prodigal son LeBron James made good on his guarantee this June, it wasn't just sweat pouring down people's faces. Getty Images \nWhile no hearts were broken except Curt Schilling's when the controversial MLB analyst and former World Series pitcher was booted from ESPN's airwaves in April . One thing is for sure though, there were plenty of tears of rage over his offensive racist and anti-transgender tweets that led to his firing. Getty Images \nKobe Bryant brought Los Angeles to tears by announcing his retirement -- some were of joy, others of sorrow. Bryant is a legend out here, but he also has pretty much set the Lakers back half-a-decade simply by sticking around. Kobe's final game was a tear-jerker for the right reasons, when he poured in 60 points on 50 shot attempts. Getty Images \nThis holiday season, raise a glass of half-iced tea and half-lemonade to a legend. Arnold Palmer was so much more than a delicious summer drink, he was the man who most placed professional golf on the map in the U.S. Palmer was handsome, charming and most of all, talented. He will be missed. \nAfter breaking ground for women's basketball and winning eight championships with her University of Tennessee Lady Vols, coach Pat Summitt lost her battle with early onset dementia Alzheimer’s in June at age 64. Both male and female athletes weeped at the loss of a sporting pioneer. Getty Images Next Slide 1 of 16 \nFrom the deaths of sporting legends to the end of championship droughts, there was plenty for fans to cry about this year \nChicago Cubs fans cried with happiness – and Cleveland Indian fans from broken hearts – when the team broke a 108-year drought and the curse of a smelly goat to win the World Series Game 7 victory that will go down in baseball history. Amid the celebrations, diehard Cubs fan Bill Murray cried, chugged champagne ... and drunkenly interviewed Cubs general manager Theo Epstein in the locker room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:56:36.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
