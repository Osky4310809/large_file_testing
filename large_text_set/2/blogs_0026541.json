By Tom Phillips Published 28/02/2017 \nXbox is getting an EA Access-style subscription service that lets you play a rotating catalogue of games for a set fee per month. \nMore than 100 Xbox One and Xbox 360 titles will be unlocked to download if you purchase a £7.99/$9.99 Xbox Game Pass. \nEssentially, it's EA Access but for Xbox exclusives and games from third-parties. \nA number of Microsoft first party games will be available when the service launches later this spring, including Halo 5. \nPublishers 2K, 505 Games, Bandai Namco, Capcom, Codemasters, Deep Silver, Focus Home Interactive, Sega, SNK, THQ Nordic and Warner Bros. are also signed up to take part. \nNotable omissions include Activision and Ubisoft. \nOther games on the service at launch include Mad Max, Lego Batman, Mega Man Legacy Collection, Terraria, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, Fable 3, Tekken Tag 2, Payday 2, NBA 2K16 and SoulCalibur 2. \nShould you want to cancel your subscription you can buy a game you'd like to continue playing for a discount, as well as its DLC. \nThis will also be useful when games leave the service. Microsoft described Xbox Game Pass as providing a \"constantly-updating library of games\" that titles will cycle in and out of. \nThe big difference, unlike Netflix and PlayStation Now, is that games aren't streamed. \n\"One of the best things about Xbox Game Pass is that you can discover and download the full titles directly on your Xbox One. That means continuous, full-fidelity gameplay without having to worry about streaming, bandwidth or connectivity issues,\" Xbox boss Phil Spencer noted . \nThe £7.99 per month subscription is in addition to the regular Xbox Live price. Is it worth it? Select members of the Xbox Preview Programme will be able to sample it soon via a smaller range of titles.
