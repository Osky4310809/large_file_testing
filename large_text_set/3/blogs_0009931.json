JOEY MENDOZA \nMANILA, Philippines - National University just got better, besting the best to clinch its third straight crown in the National Cheerleading Championships at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay City yesterday. \nPutting up a different but tougher act to its pyramid formation, the NU Pep Squad wowed not just the crowd but the judges as well, scoring 339.5 points to extend its reign in the annual championship for its fourth overall championship in the annual event which drew the country’s top cheerleading schools. \n“We’re happy because we won in this event we consider as the year-ender of the cheerleading season,” said Gabriel Bahacan, who handled NU with fellow coach Carl Pabilonia. \nFar Eastern U finished second with 304.5 points while State-owned Taguig City U Varsity Pep Squad upended the other fancied teams, including the well-funded rivals from the private schools, by snatching third place honors with 261.5 points. \nTCU, a team funded by Taguig City Mayor Lani Cayetano, also surprised the field in the Group Stunts Coed division with its Team A and Team B finishing first and second ahead of NU. \n“We don’t have money for recruitment because we’re government owned. What we do is just train hard and give it our best,” said TCU coach Algen Landas, who worked for his alma mater for free.   \nEarlier, Immaculate Conception Academy bucked a coaching change this year as it ruled the high school coed division. \nThe ICA All Stars, now handled by rookie mentor RJ de Ocampo who took over from Archie Jimenez late last year, put up a near impeccable performance to retain the crown with 319 points. \nXavierville National High School Pep Squad finished second while Parañaque National High School wound up third. \n“The pressure was double because we need to defend our crown this year compared to last year when we just performed for fun,” said De Ocampo, who was part of the 2011 NCAA cheerleading champion Perpetual Help. \n“It was also tougher this year because I have to bring my own style compared to last year,” he added. \nICA’s triumph also made up for the school’s disappointing fourth place effort in the All-Girls section last Saturday. \n“We made it to the top three last year in the all-girls division so it was tough not to match that effort. I’m really happy we made for it with a win in the coed division,” said De Ocampo. \nIt was ICA’s third title in this annual event after also lording it over in the 2014 edition. \nMeanwhile, University of Santo Tomas secured its third victory after its Salinggawi Dance Troupe topped the all-girls college division by edging Danzcom Pep Squad, also last Saturday. \nUST also reigned supreme in the Dance and Drumline competitions Friday to complete a triple victory.
