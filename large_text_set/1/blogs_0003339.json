Proposal January 2, 2017 1:55 PM Filed Under: certified nurse practitioners , Massachusetts , Medical Marijuana Medical marijuana. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) \nBOSTON (AP) â€” Certified nurse practitioners would be allowed to authorize medical marijuana use by patients under new rules proposed by Massachusetts health officials. \nPublic hearings on that and other revisions to the medical marijuana program are scheduled on Tuesday in Boston and on Thursday in Holyoke. \nUnder current rules, patients need permission from their doctors before they can register to use pot for certain medical condition. Under the proposed new rule, nurse practitioners could provide certification, although a physician must still certify use by any minor. \nAnother proposed change would allow caregiving institutions to register with the state to administer medical marijuana, rather than forcing each employee to register separately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:53:42.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
