It occupied this space in my brain where it was really mysterious, unlike any other cartoon. Watching Samurai Jack was like an intro into another world. I felt lost and confused in this futuristic world, seeing Greek warriors clash with machine. Just like how the nameless warrior, nicknamed 'Jack' felt. It was so outlandishly disorienting. It was so real, too. I wanted Jack to get home. I felt his struggle, that no matter how hard he tried, Aku was always there to foil him, causing his lonely journey to continue, knowing that those he loved were dead. Only his actions could bring them back. \nThen there was the episode with the robot assassin, blackmailed by Aku, who had taken his dog hostage. This world wasn't black and white. A robot, who just wanted the company of his pooch, could be forced to hunt down the series protagonist. \nBut Jack had his own path. Even though the writers had manipulated us into wanting the robot to get his puppy dog back, Jack still had to put an end to him. It was for the greater good, but something pure had been destroyed in the process. Another victim of Aku's treachery. \nI watched the panel where Gendy talks about the new season and describes the opening of his episode pitch. This season will follow a story from episode to episode, unlike the previous seasons where each episode had to be its own story contained. \nNeedless to say, I am so stoked to see Jack back in action. It sounds fucking badass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:28:41.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
