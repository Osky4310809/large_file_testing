You can upload GIFs by pasting in a link , but you can’t upload them directly, they need to be hosted elsewhere. \nBut really, a GIF isn’t much different to a short video (in fact that’s exactly what it is), which you can upload and will autoplay, so it makes sense for Facebook to add them as an option. This could also mean Facebook might open the door to natively posted GIFs in future – though I wouldn’t be counting on it. \nIn addition, Facebook’s also added a new date comparison tool to ads manager. \nThey’ve also added a new estimated budget and reach graph for ads – which seems somewhat redundant, as it’s going to look exactly like this for every ad (i.e. spend more, reach more). \nBut maybe the visual will help. \nAs noted, the new tools are available in Ads Manager now, though some appear to be in test mode and are not available to all users.
