Ortom cautions Benue youths against reprisal Attacks: Gov. Ortom cautions Benue youths against reprisal On 9:11 pm In News by Nwafor Polycarp Comments \nGov. Samuel Ortom of Benue has cautioned youths in the state against taking the law into their hands over recent attacks on some rural communities. \n“No one should take the law into his hands over the attacks; what we should all do is to report any breach of peace to the law enforcement agencies for necessary action,” Ortom said on Monday in Makurdi, during a stakeholders’ meeting. \nHe said that he had consistently briefed President Muhammadu Buhari about the activities of herdsmen in the state, and expressed optimism that permanent peace would soon return. Gov. Ortom of Benue State \n“I have intimated the president about the wanton killings and destruction of property in the state. \n“We have taken some measures and I can assure you that in no distant time, there will be light at the end of the tunnel,” he told the stakeholders. \nHe said that security agents were on the trail of Terwase Agwaza, popularly known as “Ghana”, who has been accused of killing his aide, Mr Denen Igbana. \n“We hope to bring him and other criminals in Benue to justice; we shall not rest until we rid the state of all criminal elements,” he said. \nHe promised to execute projects that would create opportunities for Benue people, and revealed that the Federal Government would soon release the Paris Club fund to the states. \n“As soon as the money is released, we shall let you know and seek your input in our quest toward a better Benue,” he said. \nNewsmen reports that nine local governments were hit last week, by the attackers that left scores dead, and many others injured. \nAs part of measures to end the clashes between herdsmen and farmers, Ortom recently sent an anti-grazing executive bill to the Benue House of Assembly. \nThe bill seeks to prohibit open grazing which is often blamed for the clashes between farmers and herdsmen, and replace it with cattle ranches, to curtail the movement of cattle.
