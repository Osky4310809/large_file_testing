Arnold Schwarzenegger (Photo: Noel Vasquez/Getty) \nHe said: \"We had tremendous success on 'The Apprentice', and when I ran for president, I had to leave the show... and they hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out. \n\"The ratings went right down the tubes. It's been a total disaster, and [executive producer] Mark [Burnett] will never, ever bet against Trump again. And I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, OK?\" Trump on the hit show (Photo: NBC) \nIn response, the 69-year-old actor quickly shared a video online and suggested he and the president \"switch jobs\". \nHe said: \"Hey Donald, I have a great idea: Why don't we switch jobs? You take over TV because you're such an expert at ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.\" \nArnold - who was Governor of California for eight years until 2011 - previously admitted he would have campaigned to be the Republican candidate for presidency this year if he'd been eligible to run for the position. \nThe Austrian actor said: \"If I'd been born in America, I would've run. Because now? This was a very good time to get in the race.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T22:29:52.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
