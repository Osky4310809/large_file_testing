Piazon took to Twitter after the game, saying that his loan deal was set to be extended on Monday. Loan spell ending tomorrow but monday I should be signing the extension! — Lucas Piazon (@LucasPiazon) January 14, 2017 Loïc Rémy was back on the Crystal Palace bench after a first-half run out in the FA Cup last weekend and replaced Andros Townsend in the 70th minute but couldn’t do anything to prevent Palace’s 3-0 loss to West Ham. Upcoming fixtures: Bolton (H, January 17), Everton (H, January 21) Patrick Bamford was not involved for Burnley yesterday and soon enough, reports surfaced claiming that the striker had returned to Chelsea after terminating his loan spell with the Clarets. He’s now all but sealed a return to Middlesbrough on a permanent basis, I do hope he finds success there! Jay Dasilva was named on the bench again, but was called upon in the 28th minute for the injured Lewis Page and thus made his senior professional debut, playing as a left-winger. He was then taken off in the 80th minute for Ricky Holmes. Upcoming fixtures: Scunthorpe (H, January 21) Charlie Colkett , Fankaty Dabo and Islam Feruz wasted no time in getting into the thick of things for their new club, all starting against third-placed Bolton and helping Swindon to their first win in six games, a rather unexpected one at that. Feruz played 60 minutes, Colkett played all but a few seconds and Dabo lasted the whole game. Dabo and Colkett in particular impressed, with Charlie assisting the winning goal in the 89th minute.

Roll on next week #STFC — Fankaty Dabo (@FankDabo) January 14, 2017 Great start with @Official_STFC and a great team performance topped with 3pts! — Islam Feruz (@24feruzo) January 14, 2017 Here are a series of videos, beginning with the highlights of the game itself and the loanees’ interviews on signing and following the match. Upcoming fixtures: Peterborough (H, January 21) Jordan Houghton started as Doncaster came back from a goal behind to clinch a 1-3 win against Barnet and hence staying at the top of the league table. Amazing following from the #drfc fans! Safe travels home with those 3 points @drfc_official — Jordan Houghton (@HOUGHTON_J) January 14, 2017 Alex Kiwomya played a whole 90 in Crewe Alexandra’s 1-2 loss to Luton. Crewe now sit perilously close to the relegation zone in 18th place and currently 4 points clear of it. Gutted about the result, so tough at the moment, but happy to get an assist. — Alexander Kiwomya (@Golden_Kiwomya) January 14, 2017 There was no clean sheet for Jamal Blackman but the 1-1 draw against Yeovil Town was Wycombe’s 14th game in a row unbeaten. — Jamal Blackman (@Big_Blacks) January 13, 2017 THE NETHERLANDS: Marco van Ginkel picked up right where he left off last season, playing 88 minutes and scoring on his second PSV debut, in a 2-0 win against Excelsior, for whom Danilo Pantic was not involved. Upcoming fixtures: PSV - Heerenveen (H, January 22) Excelsior - Go Ahead Eagles (H, January 22) Vitesse Arnhem kicked off 2017 with a convincing 3-1 victory over FC Twente. Lewis Baker opened the scoring with a fine half-volley finish from inside the area, with Milot Rashica and Ricky van Wolfswinkel scoring the other two. Baker was sent off in the 81st minute for a professional foul (read: tripping an opponent during a counter attack). It wasn’t a last-man challenge but there were technically grounds for a sending off, although it was the sort of challenge that would only warrant a cautionary booking more often than not (in England, at least). A silly challenge, nevertheless, which will see him miss the next two or three games. Matt Miazga was brought on following the sending off to shore up midfield and played 8 minutes; Nathan was at Cobham throughout the winter break recovering from injury and has returned to Arnhem but was not deemed fit enough to make the squad yesterday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:17:18.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
