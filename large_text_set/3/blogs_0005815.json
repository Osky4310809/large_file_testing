(Peter Schmuck) \nThe Orioles got right after Twins starter Phil Hughes , scoring the first run of the game on back-to-back doubles by Manny Machado and Chris Davis in the first. But the Twins got a run back in the second on an opposite-field triple by designated hitter Eddie Rosario and a sacrifice fly by Drew Stubbs , who finished last season with the Orioles. \nThat was all the Twins were going to get against a sharp Kevin Gausman, who gave up a run over two solid innings in his first start of the spring. \nPitchers and catchers reported for duty on Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. The Orioles begin the 2017 season at home against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 3. \nJohnson hit on hand: Utility infield candidate Chris Johnson is off to a good start at the plate this spring, batting .333 in six games, but he left Thursday’s game for a pinch runner in the seventh inning when he was hit on the right thumb by a pitch. He said after the game that X-rays were negative. \nIt was the second time he has been plunked this spring, which has helped boost his on-base percentage to .444. \nO’Day’s debut: Darren O’Day made his first appearance of the Grapefruit League season, pitching a scoreless sixth inning in which he gave up one hit and struck out two. \nMachado heating up: Manny Machado had only one hit in his first 10 spring at-bats, but delivered his first multihit game of the spring against the Twins. He had the first-inning double off Hughes and a single in the third. He’s 3-for-13 with a home run and three runs scored. \nFlaherty throws: Ryan Flaherty threw for the first time today since experiencing some shoulder soreness and reported that everything went well. Manager Buck Showalter said Flaherty will play against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday in Bradenton. \npeter.schmuck@baltsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:31:33.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
