The two kept a very low-profile for the nine months they were dating, and we admire and respect the hell out of them for keeping their love life completely private. But now, almost two months after their split, Jenny is opening up about exactly what went wrong with the two of them.\nWell, wrong isn’t the right word. Jenny still clearly respects and admires Chris , but the two were simply moving at different speeds and as things often do, the they just didn’t work out.\n“For him to go to a restaurant is totally different than for me to go,” Jenny explains in a recent interview with Vulture . “I sit in my window and I say ‘Hi’ to people on the street. I have more freedom because I’m not Captain America. I’m mostly a cartoon.” Jenny also found herself confused by the fact that Chris was so popular, and also so sexualized.\n“If you are a woman who really cares about her freedom, her rights, her sense of being an individual, it is confusing to go out with one of the most objectified people in the entire world,” she continued. “[People would approach us and be] like, ‘Oh my God, is that Chris Evans? He’s so hot!’ You’re like, ‘How dare you? That’s my boyfriend. But yes, he’s so hot.’” Moving forward, Jenny also knows what she wants from her next relationship. (Requirement #1: He has to know who Gloria Steinem is, and honestly, that should be a requirement for everyone.)\n“Whoever is the next person [I date, they’re] going to have to respect that I had a husband who I loved and this boyfriend who I loved so much, and I don’t want to have to act like they weren’t important.” If we all just had a positive, optimistic outlook on life and moving forward like Jenny, the world would be a much better place.
