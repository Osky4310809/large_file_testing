(Susan Walsh/AP)  11 AM \nAn American Airlines co-pilot died after becoming incapacitated while in the air Wednesday afternoon, officials said. \nFlight 1353, a Boeing 737, was just 2 miles from Albuquerque, New Mexico when the captain announced a \"medical\" emergency over the intercom, an American Airlines spokeswoman told the Daily News. \nThe aircraft, which had departed from Dallas-Fort Worth just before 3 p.m., nonetheless landed safely in Albuquerque around 3:30 p.m. local time, according to data. \nOnce on the ground, the co-pilot, identified as William \"Mike\" Grubbs, received CPR for nearly 40 minutes before being pronounced dead, the spokeswoman said. \nDoomed Flight 587 victims' families, 15 years later, relive pain \nGrubbs' cause of death was not immediately revealed. \n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with Grubbs' family during this difficult time,\" the spokeswoman told The News, adding that the entire airline is \"deeply saddened\" by his death. \nIt is highly unusual that pilots become incapacitated mid-air, although not unheard of. \nAmerican Airlines Captain Michael Johnston died after he fell ill during a flight between Phoenix and Boston in October 2015. A co-pilot managed to land the plane safely after diverting it to Syracuse, New York. \nMajor aircrafts, such as Boeing 737s, can generally be maneuvered safely by a single pilot, although Federal Aviation Administration protocols strongly discourage it.
