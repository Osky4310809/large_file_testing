Former Sacramento Kings centre DeMarcus Cousins. Source: AP \nThe Kings were engaged in trade talks centred on Cousins earlier on Monday (AEDT), before pulling the trigger on a trade with the Pelicans after the All-Star Game, which the big-man was involved in. \nAccording to the report, the Kings were, at one point, engaged with the Los Angeles Lakers, but those talks broke down. \nThis trade will pair two former University of Kentucky stars in Cousins and Anthony Davis, the latter recently crowned at the NBA All-Star Game MVP. \nCousins is averaging 27.8 points and 10.6 rebounds per game, thus far this season. The 2016-17 campaign is his sixth in the NBA, after being drafted with the fifth overall pick in 2010. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
