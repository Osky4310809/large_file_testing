(It doesn’t work for everything, but a large media site like Vice.com has 50+ trackers, with 40 of them focused on advertising).\nCapturing this user data helps sites sell their inventory to advertisers, but a select few companies operate in this capacity at a whole different level. Google and Facebook are the best of examples of this, as nearly $0.60 of every dollar spent on digital advertising goes to them.

There are 700,000 apps available in the Google Play store. 82% of videos watched online come from YouTube. In total, Google has at least 79 products and services.

It also builds a profile for you for serving ads – age, gender, location, income, and other demographic data.\nYou can view and actually download this history by using a tool called Google Takeout .\nMany people understand that their data helps support advertising revenues on websites they enjoy.
