She has always been someone we look to for fashion advice and Conrad debuted her baby bump in a dress that’s fit for an angel.\nThe former Hills star is expecting her first child with husband William Tell , and now that she’s far enough in her pregnancy to show, all eyes are on her maternity fashion choices and she is not disappointing.\nThe 31-year-old attended the pop-up shop before the fashion show for Rebecca Minkoff’s Spring 2017 line in Los Angeles wearing an adorable while lace dress.\nGetty Images / Rachel Murray The Rebecca Minkoff Morongo Dress features an off-the-shoulder neckline and the hem hits just above the knee. The bell sleeves gives the look of a total goddess angel and of course, her growing bump can be seen even with the flowy fabric.\nGetty Images / JB Lacroix She paired the dress with comfortable looking sandals, which is an even bigger plus when you’re pregnant. Conrad kept her hair and make-up in her signature style of classic and neutral with her blond hair parted in the center with muted lipstick and black liner.\nGetty Images / JB Lacroix Seriously, she looks totally glam and comfortable, which isn’t easy to pull off when you’re regnant, but she nailed it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:43:33.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
