Report: Samsung and LG to both launch foldable smartphones in second half of this year By - January 12, 2017 “Samsung’s foldable smartphone will allow it to be used as a 7-inch tablet as well” 2016 saw several interesting new features for smartphones like dual cameras and modularity. This year is also expected to bring some cool smartphone innovations, and one of them is expected to be foldable displays. Several reports in the past have suggested that Samsung is working on a couple of devices with this tech. Now a new report from Korea suggests that in addition to Samsung, LG is also planning to launch foldable smartphones this year. Image credit: Korea Herald Korea Herald reports that Samsung will be launching its first foldable smartphones in the third quarter of this year. The company will release more than 1,00,000 units of foldable smartphones in the Q3, a source told the publication. The brand’s foldable smartphone’s panels will face outward upon folding, which will allow it to be used as a 7-inch tablet when unfolded.\nThe report suggests that Samsung had initially completed the development of a foldable smartphone, which tucks the screen inside when folded, just like a book. This device was the subject of a number of leaks last year under the codename ‘Project Valley’. However, now the company has changed the phone’s design to the previously mentioned one, as the usability was deemed inconvenient. \nLG, on the other hand, will reportedly launch its first foldable smartphones in the fourth quarter of this year. Similar to Samsung, LG is also planning to produce more than 1,00,000 foldable devices. The report also mentions that LG may use its foldable smartphone screen technology for other global clients like Apple and Huawei as well. \nThe publication also mentions that neither Samsung nor LG have finalised their plans for foldable smartphones at the moment. Lastly, citing research firm Strategy Analytics , the report adds that the foldable display market would reach 2.7 million units this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T10:11:27.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
