So far, the account hasn’t tweeted anything, and is slowly building back up a follower count, as Twitter shifts former US president Barack Obama’s followers and tweets to a new home at @POTUS44 . But there is already an odd mistake on refreshed @POTUS page.\nThat image looks familiar. (Twitter) As engineer Adam Pash pointed out on Twitter, the header image on Trump’s new account is a picture from Obama’s first swearing-in, back in 2009, rather than his own inauguration ceremony:\nbanner image on new @realDonaldTrump 's @potus account shows highly attended inauguration… from 2009 https://t.co/mLUatJyIJF pic.twitter.com/zejh0qNjrN \n— Adam Pash (@adampash) January 20, 2017 \nPerhaps the photo was meant to be a placeholder, as Trump’s social media team gears up to start work. But one wonders why a photo from his Trump’s own inauguration— of which there are already many on the photo wires—wasn’t chosen, and why the team instead selected with a caption that reads “The inauguration of President Barack Obama, January 20th 2009.”\nPerhaps it was chosen because of the second line of the caption—”Unrecognizable crowds in the Washington Mall.” Or perhaps there was another reason.\nThe crowd size comparison, from 2009 and today. pic.twitter.com/iMYZy9PRK8 \n— Matt Viser (@mviser) January 20, 2017 \nEither way, it’s worth remembering, the election-cycle fake news scandals notwithstanding, it’s still pretty hard to pull a fast one on the internet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T20:49:18.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
