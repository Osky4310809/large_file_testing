Suarez scored last in the first half as Barca sealed their place in the final, which he will now miss (Photo: AFP) \nThe dismissals were just one crazy element of a game which also saw an Antoine Griezmann goal wrongly disallowed for offside and substitute Kevin Gameiro miss a penalty. \nIn the end Barca, who won the first leg 2-1 in Madrid, went through to their fourth successive Copa del Rey final - where they will play either Alaves or Celta Vigo. \nEnrique says Barca should appeal Suarez's second yellow but he is not hopeful of success. \"Look at what's happened in the past.\" poll loading Did Luis Suarez deserve to be sent off? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:02:54.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
