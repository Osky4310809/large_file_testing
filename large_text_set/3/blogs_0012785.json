Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLittle Mix fans have been left scratching their heads after Jesy Nelson posted a string of photos from the Kids’ Choice Awards to Instagram AFTER bandmate Perrie Edwards cropped her out of them. \nIt all started over the weekend when Perrie shared pictures to social media showing Little Mix at the KCAs in the US - but rather than the usual foursome, the images only showed three Little Mix members: Perrie, Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock. \nBut before loyal Mixers could get too alarmed, Perrie assured them there’d been no falling out, it was just that Jesy didn’t like the photos of herself Perrie had chosen.

Just a question.” \nAnother said: “If Jesy doesn't like the photo, then why the hell she post the same picture of this in her Instagram? And its cropped to. What happen kweens? Tell us!!” Little Mix at The 2017 Kids Choice Awards (Photo: Splash News) \nA third said: “I understand the caption says Jesy doesn't like any of the pictures that's fair enough not everybody likes all there pictures but then why has she been posting them and I'm not being horrible just a genuine question?” \nAnd a fourth said: \"I know the real reason why Jesy is cropped but when I heard rumours that Jesy and Perrie were fighting I nearly cried. But now I know why.\" \nOther fans, meanwhile, pointed out the photos posted by Perrie and Jesy were different so perhaps it was just the angle or specific photo on Perrie’s account that Jesy wasn’t a fan of.

Just trust that the girls have decided together what pictures to post and that there's no beef between them. \n\"Jesy may not have like any of the pics that Perrie wanted to post or maybe she found another one that they hadn't seen and posted that afterwards.” \nAnd another added: “Guys..give it a rest...these girls unlike any other band,love. Each other to death.” \nA third simply said: \"Jesy requested to crop it because she doesn't like the picture... there's no bad blood..\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T11:48:18.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
