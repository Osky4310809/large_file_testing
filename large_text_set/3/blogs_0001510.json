The cafeteria is equipped with a state of the art dishwashing machine and the laundry can be done in cutting-edge washers and dryers.\nThe new, $91-million jail inaugurated this week in Sept-Îles is being described as a “luxury” component of Quebec’s correctional system, and that’s what is making Carl Vallée, head of the Quebec chapter of the Canadian Taxpayers Association, so angry.\n“It’s not just the price tag,” he said in an interview with the Montreal Gazette. “It’s the concept in Quebec that we’re treating our criminals better than we’re treating our elderly. And that, I find, is indecent.\n“Criminals don’t need individual rooms … they don’t need plasma TVs. If we’re going to spend that money, I’d rather it went to better feed our elderly; maybe it could go to victims’ rights groups.\n“We have this bad habit in Quebec of having the rights of criminals go before the rights of victims and I find that outrageous.”\nInaugurated this week by Quebec Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux, the Sept-Îles jail replaces cells that had been located under the local courthouse and doubles the inmate capacity to 55. Full-time inmates are assigned individual cells while those serving sentences over weekends use a dormitory.\nQuestioned about concerns the installation is located close to three helicopter ports, one of them less than a kilometre away, Coiteux told reporters close attention would be paid to which inmates were allowed into the exercise yard, which he noted is enclosed by a pair of fences.\nThe first inmates at the jail are expected this spring.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T06:30:50.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
