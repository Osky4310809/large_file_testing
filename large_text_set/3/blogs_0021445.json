As the couple posed for a wedding snapshot, our eyes immediately zoomed in on the soft lavender hue of Joana's strapless gown. In a simple and minimalist move, she chose to forgo accessories and kept her hair pulled back in a loose fishtail braid. \nThis isn't the first time a bride has ditched the traditional white wedding gown , which is why we wouldn't mind seeing a few more brides slip into more colorful pieces. Though we only have this one snap of Joana's dress, we luckily found five purple dresses for daring brides-to-be. If you're feeling a wedding dress with a little more flair and excitement, shop the picks ahead.
