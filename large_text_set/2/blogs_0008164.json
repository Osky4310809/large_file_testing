The photo (and a video) has her posing with a cobra. The actress has been granted bail on a bond of Rs 5,000. \"It was alleged that she deals in endangered species, and makes profit from it. But as a professional actor all she had done was to promote her TV serial on social media platforms,\" said Shruti's lawyer, Sunny Punamiya. The actress has shared the picture from the sets of T.V. serial, Nagarjuna- Ek Yoddha . \nSpeaking to Dainik Bhaskar, the actress however dismissed rumours of her arrest. \"Since I had posted a video with the cobra on my Instagram account, they (forest department officials) asked me to come to give the statement. The department officers want to stop this illegal trafficking and I being a responsible citizen will do everything to help them out. Also, my name has been portrayed on a larger scale because I am an actress. Otherwise, it wasn't my fault at all,\" she said. Arjun Bijlani, from T.V. show, Naagin also supported the actress. Speaking to Mid-Day he said, \"I don't think the actor was aware that putting a picture up was going to land her in jail. The supplier should be put behind bars, not the actor. The entire team is accountable, why just the actor? Hopefully, this incident will create awareness around rules regarding the use of animals on shows.\" Photo credits: Facebook / Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:35:07.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
