MONOPOLY’s three new tokens all take animal form during the MONOPOLY token madness vote which took place in january, fans were given the opportunity to vote for their favorite designs from a selection of 56 new prototypes. the monumental campaign drew more then 4.3 million votes, and makes history as the game’s biggest fan-powered program to date. among the potential new pieces were futuristic designs such as a wink-face emoji, a thumbs up and a flip-flop, yet fans voted largely for more traditional pieces. MONOPOLY enthusiasts chose to save the classic car token, top hat, cat and battleship pieces, whilst the scottie dog token first introduced in the 50’s took first place as the most popular design, followed closely by the new t-rex prototype. a selection of the new piece prototype designs included in the vote the first version of the traditional board game to include the new line up of pieces will hit the shelves this fall, but fans can already buy a special edition set which includes both the eight traditional tokens alongside eight of the new prototypes. this is not the first time MONOPOLY have chosen to shake up their line-up—back in 2013, the iconic iron was dismissed in favor of a cat token. it may seem like a drastic change to the good old-fashioned boardgame, but at least traditionalists can be happy that neither the hashtag or the computer made the cut.the eight original monopoly piecesthe traditional line-up alongside a selection of the new prototypes is available with the MONOPOLY token madness edition the rubber duck piece came in fifth in the overall vote the t-rex was the most popular new prototype, ranking in second below the scotty dog the new england aquarium backed the pengiun piece in the vote beatrice murray-nag I designboom", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:16:31.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
