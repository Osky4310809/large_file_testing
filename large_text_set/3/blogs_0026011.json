Socceroos XI to play Iraq in Iran. Source: FOX SPORTS \nFoxsports.com.au understands that this formation, with two protective No.6s in front of three defenders, is what Postecoglou sees as Australia’s best chance of succeeding with the available crop – not just in qualifying, but in tournament play. \nWatch all the action on Fox Sports 505 HD from 10.30pm AEDT, with kick-off at 11pm. \nYou can follow updates in our live blog below as well. \nBIGGEST TALKING POINTS \n- Mitch Langerak selected in goal ahead of Mat Ryan \n- Three defenders at the back, excluding Trent Sainsbury \n- Mark Milligan playing in defence \n- None of the squad’s fullbacks chosen – Rhyan Grant, Brad Smith, Aziz Behich. \n- All of the middle cattle squeezed into the XI: Jedinak, Luongo, Mooy, Irvine \n- A massive show of faith in Mathew Leckie and Robbie Kruse. \nSimon Hill, who has been watching training in Tehran and will call the game for Fox Sports on Thursday, explained to foxsports.com.au the rationale behind the selection change. \n“Ange believes this system will best suit his players - he has an abundance of talent in the middle of the park, but perhaps is not getting enough from his players in the wider areas,” he said. Massimo Luongo returns to the XI. Source: AAP \n“Matt Leckie and Robbie Kruse have just one assist between them in this phase of qualifying, and their cross completion rate is around 10%. Switching to a three will, in theory at least, allow the Socceroos to dominate the ball in midfield, try to play through teams, while providing the extra security of a third defender. \n“This is perhaps the next ‘trend’ in football - Antonio Conte has deployed a back three to very good effect with Chelsea in the English Premier League, and Gareth Southgate followed suit for England against Germany last night. \n“The only problem? \n“Even though Ange says he has been moving towards this for a while, the players have only really had two sessions to try the new system out. \n“It’s also a big risk against an Iraq team that has dangerous wingers in Ali Adnan and the lightning quick Amjad Kalaf. It could leave the ‘Roos a little exposed, and this is where the experience and positional play of Mark Milligan will be vital.” \nEven though there’s been question marks over the output of Kruse and Leckie, they are two vital members of Postecoglou’s set-up and have recent minutes under their belt in China and Germany. \nMitch Langerak’s stunning elevation over Mat Ryan - despite making critical saves on the Road to Russia so far - for his form in Bundesliga.2 with Stuttgart means each of the XI steps foot onto the pitch in Iran with regular minutes, and form, under their belt. Goalkeepers, Danny Vukovic, Mitchell Langerak and Matt Ryan. Source: News Corp Australia \nMilligan’s return to XI, in defence, is testament not just to his versatility but the confidence with which he is held, while the omission of Trent Sainsbury is a reminder that Postecoglou cannot afford to risk cattle over 180 minutes of World Cup qualifying that isn’t match fit. \nIt will be fascinating to see how the rear guard functions with Jedinak and Luongo. \nTom Rogic might be missing, but this XI, and formation, allows all of Messrs Jedinak, Mooy, Luongo and Irvine to be included, to bring their form from the English Championship to the national stage. \nThis XI will try to pass Iraq to oblivion, with its mix of mobility, passing, creativity and work rate in the middle of the park. But there’s an enormous responsibility on Kruse and Leckie to patrol those wide areas defensively, while also trying to cash in on a vulnerability the Iraqis have with quality delivery into the box, for Tomi Juric on this occasion. \nIt will be interesting to see if the midfield remains narrow, and how the Socceroos manage the wider parts of the field.
