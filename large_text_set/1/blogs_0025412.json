Jeremy Corbyn facing shadow cabinet resignations over Article 50 \nIn a previously unseen edit, released yesterday by BBC journalist David Grossman , who interviewed him for Newsnight , Mr Dalyell tests the water before going on record. \n“Am I entitled to say that MPs should have the 'balls' or should we discuss the ‘guts’,” said the 84-year-old. \nMr Grossman says “balls is good, balls is fine” and a colleague chimes in: “Absolutely.” \nMr Dalyell continues: “MPs should have the balls to use their best judgement because parliament is sovereign and if their best judgement, [which] as I understand it is the best judgement of 450-more, is that Britain should remain in the European community. \n“They should have the balls to say so and vote accordingly. This is a matter of cowardice if they don’t.” \nMr Corbyn, who has insisted the Labour Party would not block the triggering of Article 50, is facing shadow cabinet rebellion after ordering MPs to vote accordingly. \nAny minister or shadow minister who breaks the three-line whip, so called because the instruction is underlined three times on paper, is typically forced to resign from the front bench. \nShadow early years minister Tulip Siddiq has resigned over the dispute already. Interviewing Tam Dalyell post brexit vote, I found him heartbroken but defiant. Lab's 3 line whip would not have pleased him! @bbcnewsnight pic.twitter.com/bmWFF0nRfj \nMr Dalyell was a keen pro-European , anti-imperialist and anti-war MP. \nHe famously and repeatedly asked subsequent Prime Ministers the so-called ‘West Lothian question’, which argued against giving Scottish MPs votes on English-only matters. \nMr Corbyn paid tribute to a “titan of parliamentary scrutiny” while Nicola Sturgeon said he was a “real giant of Scottish politics”.
