Now he will put into play some of the lessons offered by the Yankees legend as the youngster tries to help fill the massive hole created by Didi Gregorius’ strained right shoulder.\nGregorius is down and out, until May . Brian Cashman said Tuesday night that phenom Gleyber Torres, 20, will start the season at Double-A as planned; there’s no diverting from the plan.\n“Gleyber’s time is coming, but it doesn’t have to be right now,’’ Cashman said. “Especially when we have other options we can look at in the short term.’’\nThat means Wade, 22, will be in the running as the Yankees try to come up with an in-house shortstop solution.\n“I’ve always looked at Derek as an idol,’’ Wade said before the Yankees took on the Red Sox at George M. Steinbrenner Field. “I’ve met him four or five times and he has been awesome and I have nothing but great things to say about him.\n“I’m not going to change anything, I’m just going to keep working and play my game. I’m just going to go about my business the right way. I try to play the game hard. You see a guy busting it down the line and good things happen. It’s contagious.’’\nHere is the lesson, the two words Jeter told Wade that have hit home and have helped create Wade’s mantra on the diamond: Be consistent.\n“That’s what’s going to win you games, not giving outs away, not giving at-bats away,” Wade said. “That’s what I’ve always said from Day 1. Be consistent.’’\nYour browser does not support iframes. That is what Jeter did his entire career.\nWade is well-liked by teammates and staff. Everyone always talks about how polite he is as well.\n“I’ve got great parents, they raised me well,’’ Wade said. “I was taught to treat people the way they want to be treated.’’\nThat sounds like a Jeter comment.\nAsked if he could picture himself going with the team to start the season, Wade said, “Yeah, I can. I really want to be on this team to help win games. I took on this utility role to do whatever I can to help this team win.\n“You never want to see anyone get hurt and Didi is such an important player. Whatever they need me to do I will do.’’\nThe original plan was for Wade, who has never played above Double-A, to start the season at Triple-A, continue to learn the utility role.

Cashman said the Yankees will try to fill the Gregorius void in-house from a group that includes Torreyes, who started Tuesday night at short, Wade, Ruben Tejada and Pete Kozma or perhaps moving Starlin Castro back to short . Jorge Mateo has been sent back to A-ball already.\n“As a player, I just play hard every day, all nine innings,’’ said Wade, who gets reps at short on a daily basis. “I try to do the little things right to help the team win. As a shortstop I just try to make the routine play and make sure that whenever a ball is hit my way the pitcher and the coaching staff know we have an out secured.’’\nNoted one scout at the game, who has followed the lefty-hitting Wade for years: “I really like Wade. He plays the game right and you know what? When you watch him over a period of time he really grows on you. He hustles.’’\nWade will get his shot to grow on Joe Girardi and Cashman.\n“He’s had a good camp,’’ Cashman said. “We’ll eventually make a call. We’ll have some eagle eyes on guys over the next two weeks because they now know there is a position that is up for grabs. It will be interesting to see how they respond to that type of competition.\n“There is a vacancy that needs to be filled.”\nTyler Wade will take his shot.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:59:25.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
