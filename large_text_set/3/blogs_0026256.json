Mojo Rawley on Instagram, you know that he and Rob Gronkowski are pretty close boys. Last night Gronk crashed WWE Smackdown in Connecticut to support his bro Mojo. Now today he’s hyping him in the gym before next Sunday’s huge event in the Battle Royal.\nTheir Bromance is truly #brogoals. Get you a Bro like Gronk, Bros. Every Bro needs a Bro like Gronk in their lives.\nSure he’s injured and still has years on his contract with the Patriots, but pretty sure that Gronk is gonna come out in a light capacity for his WWE debut at Wrestlemania. It’s what he’s wanted for years .\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:01:52.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
