Nazy personnel \n“Burning illegal refineries with the crude was our last option so that the people will not come back and evacuate them. “However, they cannot even evacuate them because it is in a very large quantity. \n“My concern and worry is the effect these illegal acts are causing on the environment. \n“We are going to sustain this operation so that we will be able to stop all these illegal activities within the creeks in line with the directive of the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS). \n“This will enable the people in the communities to live a normal life because as we speak, aquatic life has been destroyed because the environment is polluted,” the commander said. Journalists report that the illegal refineries and over 200 tanks carrying over 10,000 litres each were uncovered by the navy on Feb. 9, 2017. \nThis came barely 24 hours after the CNS, Vice Adm. Ibok-Ete Ibas, launched “Operation Tsare Teku IV” in Warri to further combat criminal elements operating in the nation’s maritime domain. \nThe naval boss had warned those sabotaging the nation’s economic assets to desist from the act before the law caught up with them.
