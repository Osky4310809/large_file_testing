The brand also launched the Nokia 6 ( first impressions ) globally at the event, and said that the new phones will hit the markets by Q2. The Economic Times now reports that the new range of Nokia-branded Android smartphones and the iconic Nokia 3310 will be available in India by June this year. \nAs per the report, the prices of the new Nokia devices will likely be lower than those globally, and all the phones will be manufactured locally. Foxconn will manufacture all the models sold in India locally as the brand aims to take a place amongst the top smartphone makers in the coming years in the country. \nThe report adds that all the new Nokia devices will be available in India via both online and offline channels. HMD Global, which is now the exclusive licensee of the Nokia brand of phones and tablets, will utilise the existing offline retail channels that formerly belonged to Microsoft. The brand is also talking to e-commerce portals for selling the phones in India. \nAs per the report, Arto Nummela, HMD Global chief executive officer, told the publication that “the brand is following the development very closely, and is talking to Jio on the general landscape of 4G feature phones”. Analysts suggest that HMD will have a tough time in the country given the intense competition in the price categories that Nokia will launch its devices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:27:54.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
