But there are things that happen to your hair when you dye it darker that make it more of a commitment than just going platinum blonde (or a Cara Delevigne-inspired silver ) in a few ways. There are basic things to consider, like whether you want to dye your brows to match or that your complexion will look different with jet black hair and you might need to stock up on different lipstick shades that wouldn’t have worked before with your lighter hair color. Basically, dying your hair darker is a pretty big deal and not a decision that should be taken lightly.\nHelloGiggles talked to Laura Estroff, the head colorist at the Brooklyn and London based Kennaland salon , who broke it down for us. She told us:\n“T hink about a roof and all the shingles, that’s what your hair cuticle looks like. So when you lighten your hair you open up all of those shingles and sort of peel them up and pull the color all the color molecules out of them so that’s why your hair is damaged because those cuticles never lie flat again like they used to, at least in most cases.” \nShe added, “ When you darken, you’re putting color sort of on top of it. It’s not like it sits on top of the cuticle, but you’re only lifting it a tiny bit and putting color inside of it, so it helps to seal the cuticle down.” \nHere’s what else happens to your hair when you go darker, whether you want a be a brunette or hop on the glow-in-the-dark locks look.\n1. It will look shinier. \n\nLike Estroff said, you’re just lifting up the cuticle and adding color molecules to it, so it’s not just an optical illusion: your hair is actually a little thicker and bouncier. Those color molecules also add shine to you hair that a lighter look won’t. When you’re going dark, you’re adding something and when you go light, you’re stripping away.\n2. Your hair might feel damaged. \n\nThis really depends on your hair type, according to Estroff. “Everyone is different and everyone’s hair reacts differently, but going darker is far less damaging than lightening it.” That being said, remember that your hair might feel dryer at first, since either way, you’re chemically altering your hair. “There will be a difference no matter which way you look at it,” Estroff said.\n3. It will be hard to go light again. \n\nBecause you’re adding all of these color molecules to your hair, you can’t change your mind once you go dark and switch back to a lighter color right away. Estroff said, “ When you lift your hair from being dyed dark, you have an extra layer of hair color that you have to break through. It will get lighter [eventually], but it will likely be darker than your target.” \nThis also depends on how you got to dark in the first place. If you go darker from already dyed hair, Estroff says it’s near “impossible” to get super light again. If you dyed your natural hair color darker, there’s a better shot. You’re going to have to go through a lot of layers of color molecules to get what you want, so you really should think carefully before you go dark and think about what kind of in-between shades you can live with in case you ever decide to go lighter again. \n\n4. Like, really, really hard. You’ll need to color correct your hair. \n\nBut it won’t happen overnight, according to the professional colorist. “You’re entering a whole new realm of color corrections,” Estroff said. She added that at Kennaland she’ll as her clients before they go dark under her watchful eye if they’re sure. “I can’t take you lighter in a month,” she said. “ [You] really need to manage their expectations and be patient. You can get there eventually, but it’s not a one time thing. It can be a year before you get to what you want,” Estroff added. \n5. There’s more upkeep. \n\nAfter you go darker, you’re going to want to stay away from clarifying and volumizing shampoos, since they tend to lift up your hair cuticles and make the color fade faster. But so does being out in the sun and with spring break and summer around the corner, you’re going to want to ask your colorist about a color depositing conditioner.\nEstroff says that there are tons of them out on the market that will do the trick, whether you want to grab a John Frieda from the drugstore or treat yourself to the one Aveda makes. Most colorists will most likely be able to send you home with color depositing conditioner made specifically for your color. At Kennaland, Estroff works with Evo Fabuloso Pro and is able to formulate something on the spot for her clients, but there are pre-made ones you can buy, too. Hair color is personal, though, and it’s always best to talk to your colorist about how to maintain the color between visits.\nDying your hair is a fun way to switch up your routine, but it does take some thought and planning. When you dye darker, there are just a few more things to consider than when going icy white. But don’t let that stop you from being all the brunette you can be.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:42:32.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
