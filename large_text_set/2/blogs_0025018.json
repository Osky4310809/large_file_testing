The project was created by four friends, Danny Lomas (19), Dexter Black (20), Shaquille Keith (21) and Elias Riadi (19), aiming to change the conversation regarding youth fashion, style and the culture that surrounds it.\n“Being interested in fashion, clothes and style is still seen by some as narcissistic or egotistical but that really isn’t the case,” says Riadi. “The streetwear scene is evolving and there’s a real sense of community and passion which you won’t find anywhere else.”\nSeeing as the world of streetwear is often perceived as superficial, PAQ is all about celebrating that culture, and more importantly, changing perceptions around it.\n“People who love cars have shows like Top Gear, people who love football have shows like Match Of The Day… but there’s nothing out there right now for the millions of young people who are mad about streetwear and its surrounding culture,” Lomas insisted.\nFull episodes of PAQ are available to watch today via the KYRA YouTube channel , as you can expect new episodes to arrive every seven to 10 days.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:26:42.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
