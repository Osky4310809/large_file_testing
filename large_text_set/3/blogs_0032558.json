(PTI) \nAfter much speculations as the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) declared Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, one recent picture of the newly elected CM has gone viral on social media. The picture of one of the meeting recently chaired by Adityanath caught attentions of many because of the water bottle and the towel used by the Hindu leader. And in a clear difference the bottle of the chief minister was of ‘Himalaya’, while for the rest there were ‘Bisleri’ water. Even the mineral water bottle used by Adityanath was bigger than other bottles served to rest, while usually in such meetings, at least water is served equally to all. \nThe picture soon got circulated among many, with most taunting the UP CM for maintaining the protocol through even a water bottle. Even the towel kept on Adityanath’s chair caught the attention of many. While mostly the towels kept on the chair during such meetings are of white colour, the towel on Adityanath’s chair was incidentally of safron color. And as most consider the safron as the color of BJP and Yogi Adityanath, social media erupted with comments criticizing and taunting the picture of the meeting. \nAlso Watch: \nWhile the picture virally got shared among several users, many sarcastically mentioned that the right wing chief minister didn’t drank ‘bisleri’ water since it has no ‘gomutra’ (cow’s urine). A few had even commented that Yogi is not ready to affect the hierarchy at any cost. An user took it to a different level by sharing a picture where Adityanath is drinking water from a government hand-pump. \nInterestingly, even during Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s meetings the color of the towel used is generally white. However, this controversial picture of Adityanath has brought the CM amon the hot topics across the social media. Please Wait while comments are loading...
