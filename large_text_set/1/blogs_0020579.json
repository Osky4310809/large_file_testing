While Lethality’s introduction addressed the over-the-top midgame spike physical damage dealers enjoyed toward the end of the 2016 season, it’s clear we’ve gone too far in the other direction. When Lethality items do appear in builds, they’re often as third or fourth items. This presents a conundrum: most Lethality items are accompanied by out-of-combat movement speed to facilitate early-to-midgame roams and ganks, but the math just doesn’t support the investment over more concrete purchases (Caulfield’s Warhammer, for instance). So, while we’re tuning up Lethality’s damage no matter when you buy it, this change most favors early purchases. Finishing a Dirk (or perhaps even a Duskblade) once you’ve started to procure a lead will more consistently push assassins over the damage thresholds they need to get the snowball rolling. BASE EFFECTIVENESS Lethality immediately grants 40% ⇒ 60% of its value as flat armor penetration. The remainder scales with enemy champion level. EXAMPLE 10 lethality now grants 6 flat armor penetration up front plus 0.22 per enemy level, capping at the full 10 once enemies are level 18 Duskblade of Draktharr Damage after having not been seen increased. Following up our nudge to Lethality is some love for its marquee item. Much like Infinity Edge or Rabadon’s Deathcap, Duskblade is intended to be the big purchase if you’re all-in on Lethality’s gameplan of murdering everyone that’s not a tank. That said, many champions we’d expect to see with the item (like Kha’Zix or Talon) instead opt for other big ticket AD items like Ravenous Hydra or Infinity Edge itself to push their damage output to the next level. We’re adding some more bite to Duskblade’s effect to make it shine in the situations you’d expect to see it succeed. NIGHTSTALKER DAMAGE 50 ⇒ 75 Edge of Night Active cooldown reduced. Edge of Night fills out our trifecta of Lethality care packages. Similar to Duskblade, Edge is a unique item for a specific playstyle that’s getting crowded out by other options (namely, Maw of Malmortius). We actually like the tradeoff between Edge and Maw, but the trickiness of properly using Edge’s active is pushing people away from it. Targeting the cooldown opens up more flexibility and room for error when using the spell shield, making the item less punishing when you predict a teamfight incorrectly. Toss in the potential to gain multiple spell shields per fight, and you’re looking at a change that just might push this item over the Edge. Of Night. COOLDOWN 45 seconds ⇒ 30 seconds NINJA SHIELD Using Edge of Night’s active ability while Invisible/Camouflaged will no longer break the stealth. Hextech Gunblade Active damage reduced at early levels. As a powerful fringe item, Gunblade finds itself in a similar position to last season’s Frozen Mallet. While few champions are able to capitalize on its specific set of stats, those that can (Akali, Katarina, Corki) have uncovered Gunblade’s overbearing potential. When built as a first item, Gunblade’s active provides damage akin to a 5th spell for most users, easily overpowering the opposition with its instant nuke. We want Gunblade users to feel good about buying into an aggressive option, but the effectiveness of the item was just too much. ACTIVE DAMAGE 250 at all levels ⇒ 175-250 (at levels 1-18) Redemption Health down. Heal down at lower levels. Mana regeneration up. Redemption gives supports (especially enchanters) a way to contribute more directly to teamfights. However, its mid-game ability to dramatically turn skirmishes is making it the optimal first purchase on just about every support. In this landscape, whoever gets Redemption has a substantial advantage in all-ins, which leaves no room for other item choices. We’re significantly toning back its early strength, but keeping the teamfight impact that makes the item so redeeming. HEALTH 400 ⇒ 300 MANA REGENERATION +75% base mana regen ⇒ +125% base mana regen HEAL 130 + 20 per target level (150 - 490) ⇒ 40 + 25 per target level (65 - 490) Knight's Vow Cost down. Even among protector-types like Braum, Knight’s Vow isn’t seeing much play at the moment. This might just be because everyone’s buying Redemption (see above), so we want to see how this patch shifts the support item landscape before making substantive changes to Knight’s Vow. That said, a lower price point should help encourage supports to make the switch. COMBINE COST 800 ⇒ 700 Eye of the Equinox Cost increased. Cooldown reduction added. Eye of the Equinox has been suffering two-fold. Tank supports have fallen off in popularity, and Ruby Sightstone has gotten significantly more prevalent. We’re making Eye of the Equinox a bit more attractive for tanks to hit both problems with one stone.
