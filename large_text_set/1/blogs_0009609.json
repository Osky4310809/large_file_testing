And they’re now adding a character that has to be handled really carefully so that it doesn’t turn into a nightmare. Good luck, guys! Advertisement \nAccording to TV Line , Once Upon a Time is looking for a Native American actress for the part, which is an absolute requirement. Tiger Lily is also described as, I kid you not, “a force to be reckoned with” and “the kind of woman who’ll risk her life to save yours — and she’ll do it even quicker if it benefits her.” Just... don’t do this. Don’t give us the dark and gritty take on a plot that we had hoped this show had left behind in season three. Move forward, Once Upon a Time ! Stop going backwards! \nAlso, of course , she’s going to have some sort of backstory with Hook. Goddammit, this show is a plague.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T08:20:01.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
