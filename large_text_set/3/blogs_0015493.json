Linemates Conor Sheary and Jake Guentzel assisted on all three of Crosby’s goals. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \nPatric Hornqvist added his 18th of the season for Pittsburgh. Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 21 shots for his 44th career shutout, and the Penguins leapfrogged Columbus for second place in the Metropolitan Division behind Washington. \nFlorida’s Jaromir Jagr joined Gordie Howe, Mark Messier and Ron Francis as only players in NHL history to play in 1,700 games but the Panthers saw their fading playoff hopes take another hit. Reimer finished with 24 saves but received little help from those in front of him. \n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
