Save Engadget \nSince the Switch started to show up in gamer's homes, some have been complaining about issues with its wireless Joy-Cons. Problems with losing connection , particularly on the left one, have plagued some enough to attempt DIY fixes , but in a statement to Kotaku , Nintendo said there could be a reason for problems. \nNintendo: \n\"There is no design issue with the Joy-Con controllers, and no widespread proactive repair or replacement effort is underway. A manufacturing variation has resulted in wireless interference with a small number of the left Joy-Con. Moving forward this will not be an issue, as the manufacturing variation has been addressed and corrected at the factory level. \nWe have determined a simple fix can be made to any affected Joy-Con to improve connectivity.\" \nThis jibes with something CNET editor Sean Hollister noticed after Nintendo performed a quick fix on his troublesome left Joy-Con. By taking before and after pictures, he observed that the only change made was the addition of a bit of conductive foam, possibly to shield the controller from interference. Also, a new controller purchased from Amazon lacked the modification, but sported a circuit board with a different manufacturing code. \nNintendo also said that there are other reasons Joy-Cons could have connection issues, but given this information, if you're having problems then you should contact the company and get the fix.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:01:45.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
