Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Photos: Tips from a caviar concierge Start with the \"Mercedes\" of caviar – Caviar concierge Alexandre Petrossian advises first-time buyers to educate their palates and not head straight for the expensive stuff. For example, tranmontanus caviar from California costs about $50 for one serving. After trying this \"Mercedes of caviar,\" you can proceed to \"the Rolls-Royce and the Maybach.\" Hide Caption 1 of 7 Photos: Tips from a caviar concierge Inspect the tin – Try the caviar you're going to buy as taste can vary from tin to tin. Also, pay attention to the label. A few shady distributors purposely mislabel them, says Petrossian. To ensure you're getting a quality product, make sure the tin has a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species number, which represents the actual fish the caviar came from. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: Tips from a caviar concierge Chill – Once you purchase your caviar, there's about a six-week window to enjoy it. Make sure to keep it in the coldest part of your fridge, says Petrossian. Open the tin at the last minute and then put it on crushed ice before you serve it. Hide Caption 3 of 7 Photos: Tips from a caviar concierge How to eat it – Eat the caviar with a spoon made out of a neutral material like wood or bone as silver reacts with the fish eggs, says Petrossian. Put about a half teaspoon in your mouth and crush the little eggs with your tongue on your palate. To dry the palate and remove the oil before the next delicious taste, take a sip of vodka or Champagne. Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: Tips from a caviar concierge Ignore the price tag – In the end, don't worry about cost. There is no actual best caviar, says Petrossian. The most expensive caviar only has a high price tag because it's rare. \"It's all a matter of taste,\" he says. \"And all tastes are different.\" Hide Caption 5 of 7 Photos: Tips from a caviar concierge Share it with someone special – What matters is that when you do find your perfect tin of caviar, you are also buying the inevitable special memories that come with it, says Petrossian. \"Whoever you share caviar with makes the experience even better,\" he says. Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: Tips from a caviar concierge The caviar concierge – Caviar expert and Petrossian vice-president Alexandre Petrossian's grandfather founded the family's luxury business in Paris almost 100 years ago. Hide Caption 7 of 7 (CNN) \"They look like diamonds,\" says Alexandre Petrossian as he holds a tin of caviar under the light. The fish eggs sparkle inside his namesake restaurant in the historic Alwyn Court Building on 58th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, one block from Central Park. Caviar expert Alexandre Petrossian. Petrossian -- the third generation to work in the luxury business founded by his grandfather in Paris almost 100 years ago -- is here to guide the uninitiated through the fascinating process of selecting and eating the finest caviar. Though the delicacy of Russian royalty still ranks among the most expensive foods in the world, costing up to hundreds of dollars for a tiny bite, Petrossian is anything but pretentious. Instead, he's unabashedly passionate when sharing his love of sturgeon roe and introducing others to it.

But there are ways you can enjoy caviar without breaking the bank.\" Work your way up Top grade caviar is usually lighter in color. Petrossian advises novices to \"come with a learning attitude\" and \"to educate\" their palates, which he compares to the journey of becoming a wine connoisseur. \"Don't buy too high a grade at first, it's not necessary,\" he says. \"Start with the lower grade and work your way up.\" Top grade caviar is usually more mature and lighter in color. He suggests first-time buyers try tranmontanus caviar from California, which costs about $50 for one serving. Though Caspian Sea beluga is a name usually associated with caviar, overfishing endangered wild sturgeon so importing it became illegal in 2005. Luckily, farm-raised tranmontanus is somewhat affordable, \"easy to enjoy and you'll have the total experience of delicious caviar,\" says Petrossian. After trying this \"Mercedes of caviar,\" you can proceed to \"the Rolls-Royce and the Maybach.\" Hong Kong's best dim sum Don't buy it till you've tried it \"Try the caviar you're going to buy, that is key,\" as taste can vary from tin to tin, he says. And a buyer should always be wary, Petrossian cautions, as sometimes caviar is a \"fishy business -- I mean that without being funny.\" A few shady distributors purposely mislabel tins, akin to putting a Chanel tag on a knock-off purse. Petrossian suggests always examining the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) number that's on better tins. This international organization, which regulates wild game, names the actual fish the caviar came from.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:50:16.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
