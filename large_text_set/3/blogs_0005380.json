Trump’s order halted entry into the US for 90 days to all people — with a few narrow exceptions — from seven majority-Muslim nations: Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen. The order also halted the entire refugee program for 120 days and the Syrian part of the program indefinitely.\nPerhaps most dramatically, the order took effect immediately, leading to confusion at airports across the country — particularly given the Friday afternoon signing and announcement of the order. That confusion — and reports of people being held at and in some cases deported from airports — then led to protests, first in New York and Los Angeles, but soon across the country.\nAbout 30 hours after the order was signed, a federal judge in Brooklyn, US District Judge Ann Donnelly, halted deportations under the order. Throughout the weekend, other federal judges weighed in — all siding against the ban, including one court that added a ban on detaining individuals under the order and another court that ordered a person deported under the order to be returned to the US.\nAs the next week began, one of the primary issues of confusion was whether lawful permanent residents — green card holders — were covered under the travel ban. Eventually, the White House attempted to settle the issue with a “clarification” memo from White House counsel Don McGahn concluding that the ban does not apply to green card holders.\nIt wasn’t until the next Friday, Feb. 3, when a judge sided with the administration. US District Judge Nathaniel Gorton denied a request to renew a temporary restraining order previously issued by another judge in the federal court in Massachusetts or grant a preliminary injunction.\nHours later, though, in Seattle, a different federal judge — US District Judge James Robart — issued the broadest ruling yet, halting enforcement of all of the major parts of the refugee and travel bans under the order.\nThe ruling effectively shut down the ban, leading to statements of compliance from the Department of Homeland Security and State Department — but also leading to the first of several pointed attacks from the Trump administration on Robart, who he referred to in one tweet as a “so-called judge.”\nThe administration appealed, asking the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to put Robart’s order on hold while the administration appealed the merits of the district court’s ruling. After holding arguments on Feb. 7, the appeals court sided with the challengers — the states of Washington and Minnesota — in a ruling handed down on Feb. 9.\nWhile questions remained about whether the full court of appeals would reconsider that ruling, Trump announced on Feb. 16 that a new version of the order would be coming the week of Feb. 20. That was delayed until last week, but then, shortly after Trump’s address to Congress, White House officials said the rollout would be delayed. (This coincided with news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ previously unmentioned meetings with the Russian ambassador to the US — news that led to his recusal on related matters.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T16:16:57.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
