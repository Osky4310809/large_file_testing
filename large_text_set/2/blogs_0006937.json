Currently on loan at Torino , the England international is not in City manager Pep Guardiola's plans, and the Sky Blues would demand upwards of £15 million were they to let him go to a Premier League rival, according to the Daily Mail 's Kieran Gill . Gill added the Gunners may have to battle with the Reds to sign Hart, 29, while Cech will be demoted to back-up goalkeeper should he stay on past the end of the 2016-17 season at the Emirates Stadium. Cech's mistake gifted Chelsea their third goal as the Blues beat Arsenal 3-1 last time out in the Premier League and Gunners manager Arsene Wenger is reportedly planning to drop the former Czech Republic international for Saturday's clash with Hull City, per the Daily Star 's Paul Brown (h/t BBC News' Neil Henderson): Neil Henderson @hendopolis 2/8/2017, 10:18:37 PM Signed from Chelsea in a bargain £10 million deal in June 2015, Cech was excellent in his debut season for Arsenal, winning the Premier League's Golden Glove award after keeping 16 clean sheets, per Sky Sports Peter Smith . Cech has played every minute so far of Arsenal's 2016-17 league campaign as the Gunners have conceded 28 goals in 24 games—compared to 36 in 38 last term—and kept seven clean sheets, per the Premier League . Hart could definitely be an upgrade on the declining Cech. He is five years younger and, while currently enjoying his time at Torino, is reportedly eager to return to England, per Gill. The travails of his replacement Claudio Bravo at City have only served to bolster Hart's reputation as a high-quality Premier League goalkeeper: Bleacher Report UK @br_uk 2/1/2017, 6:43:43 PM Should Arsenal manage to snap up Hart it would effectively spell the end of Cech's glittering career as a Premier League No. 1 and the Daily Mail 's Oliver Todd hinted it could open the door for him to return to Chelsea: Oliver Todd @oliver_todd Arsenal in for Joe Hart; not completely happy with Petr Cech... Chelsea looking for another goalkeeper... could fit together quite nicely. Liverpool are likely to fight the Gunners for Hart, though, as their goalkeeping situation remains a genuine concern, with Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius both consistently error-prone.
