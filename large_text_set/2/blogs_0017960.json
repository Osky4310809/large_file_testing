They have no power in Congress, they don't control the White House any longer, and any hope of taking the Supreme Court vaporized the moment Donald Trump won the presidential election. It doesn't look good for progressives.\nLuckily, it seems they may have an ace in their hole. The power of witchcraft :\nWant to cast a spell on Donald Trump?\nA document detailing how to cast a spell that would bind Trump and all who abet him has been circulating the web in both private and public witchcraft groups, and even those who don't regularly practice the craft are seizing the opportunity to use magic to stop the President. There have been marches, petitions, and demonstrations against the Donald Trump, but is definitely the most magical way to #resist.\nThe ritual is to be done at the stroke of midnight on waning crescent moon ritual days, which are February 24th (midnight, Friday evening), March 26th, April 24th, May 23rd, June 21st (especially important as it is the summer solstice) etc. until Trump leaves office.\nWell, it looks like the White House is in trouble now, doesn't it?\nI've known a lot of people who call themselves \"witches\" in my day. Some are good people, and some are still good friends of mine. I don't agree with their faith, but since they don't agree with mine, it's all good. (A couple of them are ardent Trump supporters, for the record.)\nBut let's be honest -- if these witches had any real ability to affect U.S. policy, wouldn't they have done so long before now?\nIf they could do anything, perhaps they could use that magical prowess to combat ISIS and bind them from harming folks? I mean, Trump says mean things and ISIS throws gay people off of buildings, so who is worse?\nOf course, there are times when the president has no choice but to harm folks. Would the witches of America prefer to find ourselves invaded by a foreign power because the government is magically prevented from responding to an attack?\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/23/witches-unite-to-cast-spell-against-donald-trump/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.someecards.com/news/politics/donald-trump-meatloaf-chris-christie/", "http://www.someecards.com/entertainment/celebrities/kourtney-kardashian-honey-witchcraft/", "https://extranewsfeed.com/a-spell-to-bind-donald-trump-and-all-those-who-abet-him-february-24th-mass-ritual-51f3d94f62f4#.835rjtqp6", "http://www.someecards.com/news/weird-news/creepy-package-witchcraft/", "https://extranewsfeed.com/a-spell-to-bind-donald-trump-and-all-those-who-abet-him-february-24th-mass-ritual-51f3d94f62f4#.byel8iv7e"], "published": "2017-02-23T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:38:36.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
