Wash the spinach, parsley, dill, cilantro, and chives, then dry well on kitchen paper or in a salad spinner. Try and squeeze as much moisture out as possible; if the greens are wet when they are cooked, they will make the kuku go spongy. Chop finely or blitz in the food processor, in a couple of batches. \n2. Heat the grill to high. Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Add the turmeric, flour, salt, pepper and fenugreek leaf. Stir in the chopped spinach and herbs. \n3. Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the spring onions and garlic and gently fry over a low heat for 2 minutes to soften. \n4. Make sure the garlic and spring onions are evenly distributed around the pan, then pour in the egg mixture. Cook over a low heat for about 5â€“8 minutes, until the kuku is almost cooked through. Finish off under the hot grill. \n5. Leave to cool slightly, then cut into triangular slices to serve.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:28:06.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
