Labelled even at university as a “soggy Tory”, I found common cause with folk from across the political spectrum. \nThe result of the Brexit vote left huge numbers of Brits angered and disappointed. All over the country the half-forgotten rank and file of the remain side gathered for wakes. From disappointment grew a determination to make our voices heard. Thus arose Britain For Europe , or B4E – a politically neutral, grassroots campaign group – in a flat in Baker Street a week after the referendum. \nNot one of those people in that flat was ready to shut up and go home. There was resolve to do two things. First was to organise in a way that was different to the campaign, empowering the grassroots and those outside London. Second, there was the sense that politicians had let the people down and should be held to account. Democracy relies on healthy, honest debate. It's saddening that so many politicians have abandoned such a precious value \nAfter a long career in finance, I have found myself in the interim chair of this Brexit resistance group. I have been made so welcome by the diverse people that make up B4E. In the months since our official launch in mid-August at City Hall, we have reached out across the nation, drawing together the many groups that felt disappointed. These are not moaners, but citizens demanding meaning. \nThrough campaigns, letters, marches, social media, street stalls and media stunts, the Brexit resisters have swung into action. There are some 60 groups under the B4E banner, each horrified by a vote won through dishonest debate, and now being interpreted for implementation in ways that go far beyond what was articulated during the campaign. \nCuriously, the prime minister, in her speech last week , claimed that all sides had said that not being part of the single market was the likely outcome of a leave vote. This could not be further from the truth. The attempt to rewrite history has already, lamentably, begun. \nBritish democracy relies on healthy, honest debate. It is saddening that so many politicians have ridden roughshod over such a precious value. Politicians continue to pour scorn on the concerns of a large part of the population, but it is extraordinary that the government claims to have a free hand to interpret the terms of leaving based on receiving the votes of only 37% of the electorate . Stop complaining about Brexit – the economic benefits will be huge | John Longworth Read more \nThe proponents of Brexit resolutely refused to provide a manifesto before the vote, and now tell us that whatever we end up with was what they voted for. This Alice in Wonderland logic is precisely what fires up the thousands of decent British people of all backgrounds and political persuasions who fear the consequences of leaving the EU. \nThe reality of this messy divorce will make itself clear, beyond the dramatic fall in the value of the pound, once the negotiations start. Rising inflation, uncertainty for Europeans in the UK, the prospect of red tape complicating the lives of businesses trying to make deals in the EU, parts of our financial services in the City of London being relocated to Frankfurt or elsewhere, agonisingly long lead times on crucial trade agreements at a time of rising global protectionism – the list will grow. \nOur movement has already met in Bristol and Birmingham, with Leeds the next stop. At our meetings I see British people engaging in a vital debate. They seek to speak with those who voted to leave in order to understand their reasons, and they lobby political leaders to ensure that the outcome for the nation is fair, decent and right. \nThe EU has brought safety, prosperity and much else. It is far from clear that the British people voted for “hard Brexit” at all costs. There must be time for a thorough debate, review, and change of direction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T14:23:02.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
