Cory Gardner and Michael Bennet appear during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch on Monday in Washington. \nColorado’s senior senator, Democrat Michael Bennet, is blowing an important opportunity to stand up for our state and nation in sitting on the sidelines while his party foolishly seeks to block the path of Denver native Neil Gorsuch to the highest court in the land. \nInstead of working all along to stave off his party’s expected effort to block Gorsuch, Bennet kept his silence. Now, despite Gorsuch’s laudable performance throughout his confirmation hearings, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, is officially calling on his fellow senators to filibuster. \nAs we’ve noted several times in the run-up to Gorsuch’s confirmation hearings, the 10th Circuit justice posses the fairness, independence and open-mindedness necessary to make him a marvelous addition to the Supreme Court. Missing the chance to rally behind Gorsuch — who has been roundly praised here by Democrats and Republicans alike — already diminishes Bennet. He cannot remain silent any longer. \nIf Bennet wants to be known for representing Colorado, and not resting on his East Coast pedigree, he should demonstrate the same kind of autonomy and courage Gorsuch already has exhibited. \nWhen President Donald Trump went on a Twitter temper tantrum against the federal judge who blocked his first Muslim ban, Gorsuch called the tirade “demoralizing” and “disheartening.” \nWhile the comments were made in private, when asked about them during his confirmation testimony this week, Gorsuch responded: “When anyone criticizes the honesty or the integrity or the motivations of a federal judge, I find that disheartening. I find that demoralizing, because I know the truth.” \nWhen asked during his testimony whether Trump questioned him prior to his nomination about Roe vs. Wade, Gorsuch answered: “I would have walked out the door.” \nYes, senators often must be nuanced and diplomatic in their approach to public policy. And we’ve been pleased with Bennet’s ability to remain level-headed and thoughtful in navigating the corridors of power over the years. We’ve endorsed him throughout his Senate career. \nBennet’s kind words when he introduced the 10th Circuit Court judge to the Senate Judiciary Committee were a good start. He said Gorsuch was “a son of Colorado, born and raised in Denver with a distinguished record of public service, private practice, and outstanding integrity and intellect.” \nBut we simply have been left to shake our heads in dismay at Bennet’s reticence to buck Democratic leadership opposed to this confirmation. Bennet, after all, holds legitimate claim to a special place in the hearts of many of his colleagues. As a former leader of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Bennet helped swell their campaign coffers and became an Obama confidant. \nWe get it that Democrats take justifiable umbrage at Republicans’ shameless decision to leave Obama’s nomination to fill the vacancy. Merrick Garland was a fine choice for the high court , and one we supported. \nAmericans will remember such bull-headedness. Democrats now have the chance to show what statesmanship looks like in confirming Gorsuch. This is an opportunity for Democrats to remind the nation what leadership looks like in contrast to Trump’s wrecking-ball approach to the presidency. \nCalling for a filibuster likely will lead to the Republican decision to deploy the so-called nuclear option that would ease confirmation rules and subject future high court confirmations to the kind of partisan politics that divide us. \nBennet has the chance to help the nation avoid that dangerous path. He needs to take it and show Democrats the way forward — or stay in Washington, where his real interests appear to be. \nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.
