The cancer tumors are still there, however, and Nate said they’ll likely remain in his son’s body for “quite a while.” Hudson is in the surveillance stage now, with constant monitoring of his cancer. \n“He’s doing really well,” said Solder, a Buena Vista High School graduate. “If you saw him, he would be running around here probably tearing everything up.” \nSolder said when Hudson was first diagnosed he blamed himself, believing his own diagnosis had something to do with his son getting cancer. That was not true. \n“If you would have seen us at the time, (there was) a lot of bewilderment. We didn’t feel that we belonged where we were,” Solder said. “We were probably in denial of the whole situation. There was plenty of crying, plenty of tears… So often we get caught up in our own pain and our own suffering and our own issues and I think through the grace of God he’s provided a new lens on life.” \nHudson’s cancer battle is ongoing. Nate, meanwhile, had surgery to get a tumor removed from his testicle two weeks after he was diagnosed and hasn’t had a recurrence. \nOne of Solder’s best friends during he and his son’s cancer journey has been Patriots right tackle Marcus Cannon. \n“Marcus was one of the first people and one of the most meaningful people who came and talked to us, and he said, ‘You know, I understand the nightmare you’re going through but just know the nightmare does end,’ and he’s seen both sides of that,” Solder said. \nCannon was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma before the 2011 NFL Draft. He has been in remission for six years now. \nSolder and Cannon were selected in the same 2011 Patriots draft class, selected in the first and fifth rounds, respectively, but they often clashed as young players. \n“Our start was a little rocky at first when we were rookies coming in and not really knowing each other, but we have grown a lot since then,” Cannon said. “He is somebody that I can ask for help if I need somebody to talk to about non-football stuff.” \nSolder has made it a priority to use his NFL platform to make people more knowledgeable about cancer. \nTesticular cancer is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 15-34. It’s highly beatable if diagnosed early on, but many young people fail to get it checked under the assumption they’re healthy. \nWilms tumor is a rare kidney cancer that primarily develops in young children. Like testicular cancer, the survival rates are typically high if it’s diagnosed early. \nIn December, for the NFL’s ‘My Cleats, My Cause’ initiative, Solder wore cleats that had “Tough like my dad” written on them for Hudson. \nWin or lose Sunday, Solder will go home with a smile. After all, he’ll soon get to see Hudson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:56:20.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
