Eliot Engel, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the move a mistake: \n“Donald Trump’s administration is making a grave error that will shake the confidence of America’s most important alliance and feed the concern that this administration is simply too cozy with [Russian President] Vladimir Putin.” \n“I cannot fathom why the administration would pursue this course except to signal a change in American foreign policy that draws our country away from Western democracy’s most important institutions and aligns the United States more closely with the autocratic regime in the Kremlin,” Engel said.
