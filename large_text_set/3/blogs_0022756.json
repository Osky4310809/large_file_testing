I hope so, but everything can change in football. \n“I have tried not to get too much into the subject because it is not easy for him to be one day in one place and the next day in another. He learned a lot from it. It has made him more mature.” \nFor now, Herrera and De Gea are focused on ending the 2016-17 campaign on a high. \nLindelof breaks silence over Man Utd \nUnited have already lifted the Community Shield and EFL Cup under Mourinho, and they remain on course for Europa League success and a top-four finish in the Premier League. \nHerrera added on the proven winner now in charge at Old Trafford: “He is a great team coach, I will remember him as a coach who has marked me. \n“It is a myth of him being the defensive coach, we had to put a tag and [Pep] Guardiola was the offensive and Mourinho the defensive.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:40:13.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
