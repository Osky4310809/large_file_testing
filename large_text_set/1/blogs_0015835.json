Those are sacred times that you have in the locker room after games. That was a very emotional game, some things were said and done, and what you do as any coach or player that has played this game, you know that locker room after the game is a special place.”\nIn addition to violating locker room protocol and sanctity, Brown also violated NFL’s Social Media policy and could face a fine as a result.\nThis embed is invalid\nCowher continued by saying that he felt coach Tomlin handled the controversy well and that the Steelers have “moved on,” but added that their rival in this marquee matchup might not be so quick to forget Brown’s transgressions.\n“I think it was dealt with appropriately,” Cowher said. “And as I’ve heard from over there they’ve moved on from that right now. There’s just the residual effects from that, it’s created a little bit of animosity between the two teams even though not much was needed anyway. But, it certainly has added to the storyline of the week.”\nAdd to the storyline it has. While the Patriots haven’t taken the bait (shocking), Tomlin calling the Patriots “a**holes” was definitely not the type of bulletin board material the Steelers wanted to give New England with a Super Bowl berth on the line in Foxboro.\nThe Steelers and Patriots kick off what will certainly be one of the games of the year exclusively on CBS on Sunday at 6:40 p.m. ET live from Gillette Stadium.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:45:53.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
