We were the first floor and they must have been told we were the first floor. They must have been watching,” says Kim. \n“I turned the lights off and went upstairs, what I think happened now, after thinking about it so much, is there was probably a group of guys following us the entire trip. \n\"I was Snapchatting that I was home and everyone was going out, so I think they knew Pascal was out with Kourtney and I was there by myself. \n“They had to have known we were leaving that day. They had that window of opportunity and just went for it.” Kim told the robbers she had no money on her (Photo: kuwtk/Instagram) She was tearful as she spoke to her sisters (Photo: kuwtk/Instagram) She said they dragged her out into the hallway (Photo: kuwtk/Instagram) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T16:10:29.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
