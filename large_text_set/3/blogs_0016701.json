That's a relative steal in the neighborhood, where one-bedrooms rented for an average of $2,542 a month in February, according to the real estate firm MNS . \nA StreetEasy listing describes the available rental, first reported by Politico , as a \"sunny and sweet\" apartment in \"prime South Slope.\" The one-bedroom is located in a modest wood-frame row house on 11th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues. \nThe row house is one of two buildings de Blasio owns on 11th Street . The mayor's other property, on 11th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues, was his primary residence before he moved to Gracie Mansion .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:04:49.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
