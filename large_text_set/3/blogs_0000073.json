Stop. Crying,” the singer wrote. “Her vulnerability and her story ….just wow. Steph, I hope ur parents open their hearts 2 the beautiful person u r!”\nCan't. Stop. Crying.

On Tuesday, the singer shared a story about Clarkson’s reaction with the caption “If this is a dream, don’t wake me up.”\nShe also shared a message about her performance.\n“If anyone was watching last night in need of healing, my true hope is that you received a message of hope and strength,” Rice wrote.\nIf this is a dream, don't wake me up. #lovewins #myidol https://t.co/k1scfriYGq \n— Stephanie Rice (@stephricemusic) February 28, 2017 \nIf anyone was watching last night in need of healing, my true hope is that you received a message of hope and strength. #loveislove #thevoice \n— Stephanie Rice (@stephricemusic) February 28, 2017 \nRice ultimately decided to go to Team Gwen Stefani over the No Doubt singer’s boyfriend, who also wanted her on his squad. Her new coach also tweeted out her support.\nI love Stephanie so much!
