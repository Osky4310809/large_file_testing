While the speech itself was a snooze-fest, Obama broke from presidential precedent and basically held a campaign rally for his Farewell Address. \nPresident George W. Bush gave his Farewell Address to a small crowd gathered in the White House. President Clinton gave an address from the Oval Office, as did Presidents Reagan and Eisenhower. \nFor a president to gather before a huge crowd to say goodbye is unusual. While Obama will surely speak at campaign rallies for other candidates in the future, this was his last chance to give a rally for himself, the last rally for a president that's always excelled at campaigning instead of governing. \nOr is it his last rally? \nIt was clear Tuesday night that Obama isn't ready to leave office. It says a lot that he recently said he would have won if he had run again ( questionable ). Even his Farewell Address was the longest in presidential history . \n\"It has been the honor of my life to serve you,\" Obama said. \"I won't stop,\" he added, seemingly suggesting he won't be quiet in the post-presidency section of his life. And despite being the last major speech of his presidency, the speech didn't seem to carry the huge emotional weight of someone who thought they were giving the last major speech of their life. \nWhat does that mean for the Democratic Party? It sure seems like Obama is going to suck the air out of the party, and be a distraction for years to come. Is he willing to step out of the spotlight and let a new generation of Democratic Party leaders take charge? \nHe'll have to get used to working behind the scenes instead of rallying the public if he's truly willing to give the next generation their turn. \nOr maybe he plans on coming back as a political spouse.
