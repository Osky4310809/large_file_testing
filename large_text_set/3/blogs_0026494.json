Not only did she werk the look, she also inspired us to switch up our spring style game. But when we found out she was wearing Reformation’s breastfeeding dress , our minds were blown. Who knew a frock this functional and fabulous could even exist?\nBell — who has been open about breastfeeding her two children, Delta, 2, and Lincoln, 3 — donned the black floral dress while out in New York this week, taking advantage of the city’s spring weather. The frock features a wrap-front silhouette — for baby’s “easy access,” according to the brand — and is “bra-friendly,” so engorged breasts don’t have to go without proper support.\nAlessio Botticelli/GC Images Reformation introduced the dress before Mother’s Day last year with a campaign starring model-mom Abby Brothers and her infant baby. One photo even featured Brothers breastfeeding, natch.\nCool dress, Mom. Engineered for easy access. #AddilynDress #MothersDay \nA post shared by Reformation (@reformation) on Apr 25, 2016 at 1:45pm PDT \nThe 100% viscose dress is drapey, crepey perfection, cut loose through the hips for maximum breeziness and ease of wear. Pair it with over-the-knee boots — like Bell — for a cooler spring look, then pull it out again when temperatures heat up and rock it with your favorite sandals.\nReformation The dress is currently sold out, but retails for $248. You can request it, though, in Bell’s black floral (get it here ), a yellow floral (get it here ), a white floral (get it here ), and a rich, pattern-less navy (get it here ).\nMother’s Day is coming up quick! You can thank us later for alleviating all of your shopping-related stress.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T04:46:33.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
