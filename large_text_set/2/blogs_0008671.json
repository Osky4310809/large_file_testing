ALI COLA can be ordered online and will soon be available in the berlin and hamburg metropolitan regions. each purchase supports kiron , an NGO that helps refugees earn university qualifications through online courses and partner universities. nina azzarello I designboom", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:06:45.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
