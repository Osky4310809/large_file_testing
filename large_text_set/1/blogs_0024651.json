The struggle is real, as they say, and few musicians know it better than Matthew Logan Vasquez . On his new solo album, Does What He Wants , the Delta Spirit frontman contends with impatient landlords, financial strains, and other types of agitations that have a way of sucking all the air out of a room. \nBut Vasquez’s new single, “Same”, doesn’t succumb to all of the aforementioned pressures. It takes a different angle, rising above them with a strong and soulful melody that stands up to the singer’s best work with Delta Spirit. “Same” — which also features Kam Franklin of The Suffers — is a fun, feisty song that refuses to succumb to despair. \n“This song is about all the financial difficulty I went through that caused my family and I to move in with my mom for most of 2016,” Vasquez tells Consequence of Sound . “[It’s] about confronting adversities in life and how we all go through it.” \nDoes What He Wants is set to drop April 21st via Dine Alone; digital pre-orders are available here , with physical copies available here . \nDoes What He Wants Album Artwork: \nDoes What He Wants Tracklist: 01.
