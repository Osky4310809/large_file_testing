When you’re playing basketball on a travel team, people don’t really expect anything because they haven’t really seen an Indian basketball player,” said Natesan. a standout senior guard for Colorado School of Mines. “So it’d definitely catch people by surprise, and there were definitely challenges coming up and establishing myself as a player when there’s not really any notable Indian-American players. But I grew to embrace it.” \nNatesan dreamed of playing Division I basketball, but his lone scholarship offer coming out of Cupertino High School in the South San Francisco Bay area was from Mines. Now, four years later, the 6-foot-5 third-team All-American has led the No. 11-ranked Orediggers into their first NCAA Division II Elite Eight appearance. Mines plays Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. in Sioux Falls, S.D., against No. 2-ranked Bellarmine, from Louisville, Ky. \nThe Orediggers, much like their leader, appear to be outliers. \nThe school renowned for its engineering program can recruit only players who are elite in the classroom — to the tune of a minimum 27 ACT score — but the high academic hurdles haven’t prevented Mines (30-4) from setting a program record for victories in the midst of its seventh NCAA Tournament appearance in the past eight years. \nNatesan leads a patchwork roster of engineering whizzes from all across the county, and two from overseas, on a team that can go 10 deep. The Orediggers have an old-school approach to basketball, placing heavy emphasis on passing and quality shot selection. Mines is fourth among Division II schools in assists, averaging 17.4 per game, and is making 52.6 percent of its field goals. \n“If you look at our numbers, we’re playing great team basketball. We’re shooting it at a high percentage and we’re rebounding well,” said coach Pryor Orser, in his 16th season at Mines. “This team is playing as well as any team I’ve ever coached, and that’s all enabled by Gokul Natesan playing the best basketball of his life.” \nNatesan, who has scored 2,000 career points, will again take center stage Wednesday in a moment far removed from his early days playing basketball in northern California. It used to be the opposition would look at Natesan and wonder whether the wiry Indian kid had game. \nNow he’s usually the center of the opponent’s game plan.
