The ruling is expected to go to to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe ruling came after a federal judge in Seattle last week placed a stay on Trump's executive order , allowing travelers and refugees from Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Sudan to again enter the country. \nThe Trump administration had argued that the executive branch has the authority to restrict immigration. \nThe government's lawyer, August E. Flentje, argued during an appeal hearing Tuesday it was not up to the courts or states to take part in \"very troubling second guessing\" of a presidential order concerning \"national security.\" \nFlentje asked for any ruling to at most be limited to \"previously admitted aliens\" covered in the State of Washington's case. \nWashington State Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued it was up to the judicial branch to act as a check on the executive if an order potentially violated federal law and protections, which has \"never been more important in recent memory than it has today.\" \nHe added that rescinding the stay and allowing the travel ban to resume would also \"throw this country back into chaos.\" \nTrump reacted to the Seattle judge's rejection of the appeal on Sunday, blasting the court. Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 Travelers from the affected countries started to fly into New York after the initial appeal was rejected. An Iranian CUNY student and teacher returned to her Brooklyn home on Sunday and a stranded Sudanese doctor returned to his residency at Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn . About 60,000 visas were revoked nationwide while the ban was in place, according to the State Department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:29:00.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
