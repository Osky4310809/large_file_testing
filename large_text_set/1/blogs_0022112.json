REUTERS/Pascal Lauener 5441495 \nMacedonia has entered 2017 with a running start, setting itself into a strong global position with the recent election of experienced politician Nikola Gruevski as it’s Prime Minister-elect. However, the small, Balkan, land-locked country continues to face the flow of immigrants from the Middle East reaping instability in Europe, as well as the questionable intentions of George Soros’ Foundation within Macedonia’s civil society. Despite the change in leadership in USA, Macedonia clearly continues to face challenges, both internally and externally. \nMore than one million people have come from Turkey and through Greece trying to reach the European Union. And even though Macedonia is not the final destination, the country has managed the situation and the millions of people affected by offering safe passage through the Western Balkan route into Greece. \nMacedonia has proved to be a strong, stable nation during this period of massive upheaval across a pivotal region in Europe. With the Syrian refugee crisis leaving the future of Europe uncertain, Macedonia has stepped in to play a leading mitigating role, and is doing its part to fight terrorism and the threat of ISIS. This future NATO member, despite its small size, has acted as the primary transit path for refugees escaping war-torn countries like Syria, taking extraordinary measures to address both the security issues and humanitarian concerns posed by the refugee crisis. What’s more, despite being surrounded by three EU and NATO member countries, and with increasing political instability threatening the Balkan region, Macedonia has been left to deal this crisis on its own. \nMacedonia has played a major role in addressing a global issue that was dropped on its doorstep. And as an obvious result of dealing with these challenges, Macedonia has endured significant costs. But the efforts have helped make this under-the-radar country a vital ally in the fight against ISIS – and the fight against terrorism at large. \nMeanwhile, Macedonia is fighting another enemy within its own borders: billionaire George Soros and his Foundation. Soros and his organization, disguised as an international civil society partner, have been meddling in Macedonia and its politics for years. For over a quarter of a century, the American group has dumped millions of dollars into always attacking VMRO DPMNE party no matter if in Government or opposition and always supporting SDSM – former Communist party of Macedonia. This is a clear-cut case of an attempt to buy influence, insert itself into Macedonian politics and media, and create instability across the country and the region. \nAs Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said when describing Soros and his foundation, “His foundation, in finances and human resources is the most powerful foundation in the world that has political goals. Soros decided to use his fortune to exercise influence in two directions – ideological to the creation of so-called “Open societies” and financial, through speculation and previously known political outcomes in certain countries to capitalize on the stock market. After a while, entire institutions, ministries, perhaps governments and their intelligence services are infected with his views, his ideology, his views and goals.” One must note that Prime Minister Gruevski is the first European leader to speaking open and direct against George Soros, the power of Soros is that big in Europe so many fear even to mention his name. \nWhy exactly would an American businessman be interested in spending millions of dollars in Macedonia? \nThe main reason includes financial and ideological interests. George Soros is aiming to weaken the Macedonian government, exert influence over the country’s elections, and weaken Europe by exploiting the refugee crisis in Macedonia in order to drop the value of European currency through speculation. Soros worked with the U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia and other influential figures to implement his plans and undermine the Macedonian political system. \nFortunately, the election result has showed that George Soros and his money would not, and could not, win. Macedonians would now allow it. The country’s citizens voted for the political leadership and clearly showed the type of country they want – and not what George Soros and his cronies prefer. The people have spoken: Macedonians will control the future of Macedonia. But Soros is not ending there — media and influential people funded by his Open society institute do an intensive campaign with main aim Gruevski not to create coalition with his partner DUI who is representing the Albanian minority. In Macedonia there is unwritten rule that the winner of the elections is always making coalition with the party that has the most MPs from the Albanian community which represents 25% of the population of the country. This gives ethnic harmony to Macedonia as key state for the stability of the region. Soros is attacking this principle aiming to create instability in all region. But the people have spoken and now it’s to Gruevski and his Albanian coalition partner DUI to respect the will of the people. To end with Soros and bring stability to all region. \nIn the words of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, “Soros cannot succeed because justice is on our side. Regardless of his motives, our struggle is honest and just. And it will never stop, and he cannot push us away from the truth path and goals. He will not push us away from Macedonia.” \nOn January 15 the Macedonian diasporas in USA gathered in NYC in front of the Trump tower to support the elections of President Trump and his struggle against George Soros, they asked the President-elect to help Macedonia as well in this struggle . The President-elect has a fellow and ally in Macedonia in these substantial challenges as the European refugee crisis and straggle for free civil sector is. This just and honest struggle will be successful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T02:47:31.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
