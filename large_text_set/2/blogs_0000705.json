So outside the box the rules have got to be the same. \n\"The contact is minimal, and he leans into [Adam] Lallana, so there is no way in the world that's a free-kick.\" \nWebb takes Gerrard's argument on board, and agrees with him to some level, but defends the fact that Clattenburg's view of the challenge was obscured.

That it's gone ten yards in front of him, and he's drawn the foul. You said it yourself, he's drawn the foul, he was clever.\" \nWebb once again agrees with Gerrard to a point, and admits that when Clattenburg looks back on the challenge later he will likely concede that he got the decision wrong. \n* BT Sport is your home of unmissable live football from the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and FA Cup.
