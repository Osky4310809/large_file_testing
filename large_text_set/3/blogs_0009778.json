(Photo: Getty/AFP) \nScarlett Johansson stepped into Ivanka Trump's high-heeled shoes on this week's Saturday Night Live to deliver a diabolical impersonation of America's First Daughter. \nAfter Alec Baldwin reprised his Trump impression to kick off the show , Johansson donned a long blonde wig and a smoky eye to play Ivanka in a fake commercial for her clothing line's new fragrance, cheekily titled \"Complicit.\" Introducing the newest fragrance from Ivanka Trump. #SNL #Complicit pic.twitter.com/iOvia8csHk   \n\"She's beautiful. She's powerful. She's complicit,\" the commercial's sultry voice-over said as Johansson-as-Ivanka posed for the camera. \"She's a woman who knows what she wants, and knows what she's doing.\" \nThe commercial also referenced criticism of Ivanka's support for women's rights — \"A feminist. A champion. An advocate for women. Like...how?\" — before touching on how President Trump's controversies could potentially impact his daughter's career. \n\"She's loyal. Devoted. Probably should have bounced after that whole Access Hollywood bus thing.\" \nThe commercial ended with this stinging indictment of Ivanka: \"Complicit. A fragrance for the woman who could stop all this, but won't.\" #Ivanka is #Complicit #SNL She's only a feminist for 1%er skinny white chicks.
