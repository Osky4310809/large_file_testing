We are here to state that every Nigerian in disapora, friends of Nigeria, should join this committee in demanding that every stolen fund of Nigeria recovered in any part of the world should be returned to Nigeria. \n“You can’t give us aid of a billion dollars and keep a billion dollars of funds you have recovered from Nigeria. We will join the committee to embark on an advocacy with Nigerians outside the world to appeal to these nations to do everything possible to return what belongs to Nigeria.” \nIn his remarks, Chairman of PACAC, Prof Itse Sagay, SAN, stated that the fund was different from the earlier $480 million forfeited to the US following a court judgment in August 2014. \nSagay lamenting that the tracing, seizure, forfeiture and return of Nigeria’s assets laundered outside the country had become a challenge due to the uncooperative nature of the countries in possession of the fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T08:21:16.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
