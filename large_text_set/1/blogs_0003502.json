Tumblr user riveralwaysknew shared a story about how she had taken her father to see the movie and he was stunned to see a Mexican in a lead role. https://riveralwaysknew.tumblr.com/post/155327892192/i-took-my-father-to-see-rogue-one-today-ive View this embed ›\nID: 10262506 5. Quote: : “I wanted my Mexican father, with his thick Mexican accent, to experience what it was like to see a hero in a blockbuster film, speak the way he does.” Her father couldn’t believe what he’d seen, and also that the film had been so popular with such a role in the lead.\nShe finished her note by explaining how her dad had then asked why Diego hadn’t changed his accent to an American one. She responded: “I told him that Diego has openly talked about keeping his accent and how proud he is of it.\n“And my dad was silent for a while and then he said, ‘And he was a main character.’ And I said, ‘He was.’ And my dad was so happy. As we drove home he started telling me about other Mexican actors that he thinks should be in movies in America. Representation matters.”\nID: 10262534 6. And the story certainly meant a lot to Diego. He took a screenshot of the Tumblr post and put it on his Twitter alongside the caption: “I got emotional reading this!” I got emotional reading this! #RogueOneStarWars\n— diego luna (@diegoluna_) ID: 10262505 7.
