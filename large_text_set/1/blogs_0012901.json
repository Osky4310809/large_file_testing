The workshop was led by Barbara Carrellas, author of Urban Tantra: Sacred Sex for the Twenty-First Century , and the students went through breathing, muscle contracting, and chakra balancing exercises to reach climax. \n\"When the instructor gives the command, we’re to breathe 30 quick breaths in unison. It’s an individual exercise, yet we’re working as a group to achieve a hands-free 'orgasm.' Heavy breathing, chests heaving, students moaning. Even the normally taciturn ones are sighing audibly. A tingling sensation starts in my lower belly and seems to travel up into my head (like, where my brain is, not my penis ). The music becomes a loud and powerful tribal chant. People begin to curl over into the fetal position. Orgasm is finally achieved !\" \nSo orgasm without sex or masturbation is actually possible? The mind is a powerful beast, indeed. GifWave \nAs the blogger describes, the sensation wasn't exactly like the orgasms he's experienced before . \"If this is an orgasm, it’s the strangest one I have ever had. I’m not entirely convinced,\" he said. \nBut the post-climax serenity he experienced were unlike anything he's ever felt. True to Tantra , the goal of the \"genderless orgasm\" (for men) is not ejaculation but harnessing and getting pleasure from the body connecting with Earth energy. \nExtending or enhancing orgasm seems to be on many a short list, and using the power of the mind and breathing exercises, a G-spot shot or — gulp —Orajel and two condoms , are just some of the ways people are doing it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T05:22:18.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
