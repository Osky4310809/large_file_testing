UNC’s Luke Maye hit a jump shot in the final seconds to get the victory. \nUnfortunately for certain basketball fans in the Columbus, Ohio, television market, the CBS local news station in the area cut into the game’s feed for a breaking news alert for severe weather in the area. But instead of seeing a news crew, fans were left watching a blank screen in place of Maye’s amazing game-winner. \nI wish I was watching the basketball game pic.twitter.com/u6SmilL5Lw \n— Ari Wasserman (@AriWasserman) March 26, 2017 SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT IS HAPPENING pic.twitter.com/rHPu9A4PHb \n— Tim Shoemaker (@TimShoemaker) March 26, 2017 Shout-out to @10TV for cutting into the end of the game with a black screen. I sure hope nothing crazy happened! pic.twitter.com/CGTGpqtenj \n— Coach Mark Titus (@clubtrillion) March 26, 2017 Here was my view of the buzzer-beater.

And it’d be one thing for the viewers to be interrupted by an actual news break about the weather, but instead they saw just a big ol’ blank screen. \nHopefully the local news station issues some sort of apology on this one.
