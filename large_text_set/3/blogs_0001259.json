He noted the Obasanjo Presidential Library would help other to under his work and leadership qualities. \nOn her part, Khimulu, said the library was not only for Nigeria but also for Africa, and she urged the youth to take advantage of it, and embrace the leadership qualities of the former president. \nShe said, “This is a landmark that should be emulated by all African countries.” \nWhile talking about the library, Obasanjo said the library “is an act of God.” \nHe said that while in the military as Head of State and while he served in war front during the civil war, he did not gather as much materials which could have been in the presidential library. \nHe said, “Somebody among the university dons who spoke earlier said God has always given me the opportunity to correct my wrongs. Not in all cases but in most cases and this Presidential Library is actually an act of God which He has given to me to correct one of my mistakes of the past and I have said this very often. \n“I was in the war front, it was very one significant thing in my life and in the life of Nigeria. I was military head of State, it was one significant thing in my life and in the life of Nigeria but I was not as mindful as I should have been about collecting materials that were connected with those events.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:21:36.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
