Brown Convention Center. Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports \nIn the Tom Brady/Bill Belichick era, the New England Patriots’ Super Bowl trips always have been entertaining, as no game has been decided by more than four points. \nAnd if the “Madden NFL 2017” simulator is right, Super Bowl LI will be more of the same. \nThe video game franchise released its prediction for the big game Wednesday, and it has the Patriots beating the Atlanta Falcons 27-24 on a fourth-down touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Julian Edelman with only 20 seconds remaining. \nIf Super Bowl LI is as exciting as that simulation, we’ll be talking about it for years to come. We wouldn’t mind that. \nAnd “Madden” has correctly predicted nine of the last 13 Super Bowls, so there might be some truth to this simulation. \n  NESN.com and  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T09:40:28.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
