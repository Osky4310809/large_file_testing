Nowhere in the world can you find better gin and tonics than in bars in Spain. \nI have loved G&Ts for a long time, but it only occurred to me that what I had to come to see as the 'right way' to serve a G&T was actually the 'Spanish way' when I went to a cocktail bar - Amor y Amargo - in New York that had 'Spanish-style' G&Ts on the menu. \nAs Cognac-Ferrand president Alexandre Gabriel, quoted in an article about gin and tonic , says: \"Only Spain knows how to make a gin and tonic.\" \nSo what makes a Spanish gin and tonic so perfect? The elaborate preparation of a G&T in Spain. (c) Damian Corrigan The Perfect Gin and Tonic Recipe (Like They Do it In Spain) Take a large wine glass with a long stem. (OK, not like in the photo. Like this: copa de balon ). Fill it with ice. We're talking five or ten cubes here, depending on the size of your glass. A good G&T is COLD. Choose a garnish. The more imaginative the better (more on which garnish to pick further down the page). Pour the gin onto the garnish, so as to properly flavor the gin, followed by tonic poured from a freshly-opened bottle or can. Though tastes vary, you probably want a ratio of 2:1 or 3:2 (tonic to gin). This might be more than you're used to. See below on why the Spanish can make their G&Ts so strong and so tasty. Give it a light stir and hear the ice cubes jangle, add a straw and serve. \ncontinue reading below our video America's Best Foodie Cities Botilleria doesn't have the biggest gin selection, but there isn't a dud here. (c) Damian Corrigan The Best Gin for Gin & Tonic \nG&T needs a London gin - which is most gins in the world. Don't go near Gordon's, which is nowhere near the quality it was when James Bond would drink it. Avoid the subtle Plymouth, which is not a London gin (put that in your martini instead) or the back-in-production classic Old Tom gins (they're for your Tom Collins). \nThe standard premium gin in bars in Spain is Tanqueray which has a great fruity flavor and is pretty cheap. At home, the best drink is the one that can be easily followed by another one, so the excellent value of Tanqueray makes it my best gin for a gin and tonic. \nIf you want to drink a Spanish gin , go for the premium Larios 12, or the standard larios if you need to save a bit of money. \nThankfully the Spanish haven't fallen for the marketing might of Bombay Sapphire, which tastes like perfume and is responsible for so many people saying they don't like gin. A selection of popular brands of tonic water. (c) Damian Corrigan What is the Best Tonic Water for the Perfect Gin and Tonic? \nSchweppes is the standard brand of tonic for a G&T, of course, but the Spanish obsess over Fever Tree, an all-natural tonic water from Britain. I compared the two brands both side-by-side at a bar in Malaga (the one mentioned below) and I have to say that in comparison to the Fever Tree, the Schweppes has a very synthetic aftertaste. \nHowever, in isolation, it's not different enough to warrant making it my go-to tonic. \nRemember: always use a freshly opened bottle of tonic for every drink! The freshness of the tonic is more important than the brand you use. See all those bubbles? If it looks so bubbly early, it will go flat quicker. (c) Damian Corrigan Why Do Bars Pour Their Tonic Down a Spoon? \nBecause it looks cool! \nI was once in a bar in Spain where two bartenders disagreed on the effect that pouring the tonic down the spoon has on the drink. One said it was to preserve the bubbles, the other said it was to kill some of the bubbles! \nThe first bartender argued that there is no splashing as the tonic reaches the glass, whereas the second (and myself) pointed out how much the tonic is disturbed as it travels down the spoon. \nTonic poured down a spoon makes it look fizzier when the drink is presented to the drinker. But the more bubbly something looks, the quicker the drink will go flat. \nUnfortunately, most bars in Spain do this. On the plus side, it doesn't affect your drink that much. Inventive or over the top? Garnishing the Spanish G&T is a controversial topic. (c) Damian Corrigan How to Pick Your Garnish for the Perfect Gin and Tonic \nThere's two ways to garnish a G&T - the classic way, and the Spanish way. \nFirst, let's answer the classic question - lemon or lime in a gin and tonic? \nThere are two contradictory schools of thought here. It's all about the 'botanicals', the flavors in gin that differentiate it from vodka. Juniper is the main one, but lemon, cardamom and cassia bark are among other frequently included flavors. So, there's lemon already there. Now, the question is: do you want to 'bring out' the lemon with more lemon, or complement the flavor by adding one that's not already present - in this case, lime? \nThere'll be some sciency-stuff that would prove one way or another whether you can 'bring out' flavours in this way, but we're not doing science here: this is art. \nUltimately, it's down to taste. So, if there is no right or wrong way to garnish your G&T, why stick with lemon or lime in the first place? \nEnter the Spanish! How the Spanish Garnish the Perfect Gin & Tonic \nEver since the marketing guys at Hendrick's thought of putting cucumber in their self-styled 'unusual' gin, the Spanish have been experimenting with G&T garnishes that aren't citrus fruits beginning with the letter 'l'. Any gin bar in Spain worth its juniper will offer you a variety of garnishes. \nGin is a varied beast, so why not vary your garnishes? Below are the garnishes I saw at San Telmo's in Barcelona. I chose this bar's selection because it had the most extensive list I've seen; that doesn't mean all their choices were good! Citrus fruits Lemon, lime, pink grapefruit, orange. Herbs and Spices Coriander, mint, cardamom, cinnamon, parsely, nutmeg, pepper, curry powder(!) Roots Ginger, liquorice Berries Grapes, raspberries, juniper. Other Cucumber, chocolate. \nA lot of bars in Spain try to match garnishes to particular gins. I think this is going a bit over the top. Experiment and find your favorite garnish for your favorite gin. \nAnother thing to bear in mind is that there are now many sweet gins in Spain now in Spain and it is with these gins that you might expect to see some of the more unusual garnishes. With the huge hype around gin and its crossover into mainstream bar culture in Spain, manufacturers are makings gins 'for people who don't like gin'. If you are in a good gin bar, you'll be able to guess what the gin is like from the garnish they use. If you can't imagine you'd like a gin with strawberries in it, don't order it. On the other hand, if your favorite drinks tend to have strawberries in them, maybe you'll like this G&T. The secret to a good, strong G&T is lots of ice. (c) Damian Corrigan How Can the Spanish Make Their G&Ts So Strong?! \nA Spanish bar will usually pour you between 70ml and 90ml of gin, using most of (or all of) a 200ml bottle of tonic to complete your drink. This is a ration of between 2:1 and 3:1. Try that in your average British pub and you'll get something that tastes largely of alcohol. The difference is so marked that I've heard people suggest that Spanish bars water down their gin. In fact, the reason is the complete opposite! \nSo how can Spanish bars make their gin and tonic so strong? \nOur tastebuds have evolved to pick up bitter over anything else (because, in the wild, bitter often means poison). If you water down an alcoholic drink too much, it is the bitter flavor of alcohol that will shine through the most. (There is a good level of dilution required with drinks such as a dry martini, but in a long drink like a G&T the gin is already diluted with the tonic so there is no need for any more dilution.) \nBut it is not devious bar owners outside Spain that are diluting your G&T. The real culprit is the ice. This is why Spanish bars fill their oversized glasses with so many cubes: the more ice cubes, the slower it will melt. Slower melting means less water in your drink and so less bitterness coming through. Gin Tonic in Malaga uses CO2 to chill their glasses quickly. (c) Damian Corrigan Where Can I Get a Good G&T in Spain? \nServing a G&T in a big glass with lots of ice and a nice garnish is fast becoming the norm in Spain (in fact, it's starting to spread around the rest of Europe too!). Look behind the bar for the oversized balon glasses and you know you've got an appropriate bar. \nHowever, as I hope this article has shown you, there are still pitfalls to making a good G&T. Plus, there are bars in Spain that take the gin and tonic to an even more impressive level. Check out my favorites below. G&T cocktails at Bobby Gin in Barcelona. (c) Damian Corrigan 1. Bobby Gin, Barcelona \nBobby Gin is the best bar in the world to drink a G&T in. Not only do they have an extensive range of gins, tonics and garnishes, but their gin and tonic cocktails are the next step in pimping your drink. My favorite was the one spiked with barrel-aged chartreuse and lime juice. \nAddress : Francisco Giner 47, Barcelona", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:00:43.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
