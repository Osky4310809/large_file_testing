On Monday, the Scream Queens star posted a sweet throwback photo of her cuddling up to her late boyfriend, Cory Monteith â€” the latest in a string of old photos she's shared on Instagram. Even though she doesn't caption the picture, the Polaroid does include the text, \"Bleeker St\" and \"2012,\" the year before Cory died of an overdose. Ever since his untimely death, Lea hasn't been shy about opening up her love for the Glee star. Not only did she share a sweet message on his birthday , but she also has a tattoo in his honor .
