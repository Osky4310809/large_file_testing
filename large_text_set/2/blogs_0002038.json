Writing an open letter to the Bandcamp community today, founder and CEO Ethan Diamond announced that his company will be giving all of its proceeds from music sold this Friday, February 3, to the ACLU. \nDiamond’s letter called out President Trump for his actions, writing, “Last week’s Executive Order barring immigrants and refugees from seven Middle Eastern countries from entering the United States is not simply immoral, it violates the very spirit and foundation of America.” Diamond and his team also compiled a selection of music and albums from artists from Mexico and the seven targeted countries, in case you were looking for something specific to spend your Bandcamp money on this Friday. \nThe ACLU has become a focal point for people looking to find a way to support those affected by the ban. Multiple celebrities, including Dan Harmon , erotica author Chuck Tingle , Sia, and Shark Tank’ s Chris Sacco , have made matching donations or otherwise giving to the organization, which has been publicly working to contest Trump’s order and free people detained because of it. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:35:51.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
