It is used often in Christian wedding ceremonies . \nIn this famous passage, the Apostle Paul described 15 characteristics of love to the believers in the church at Corinth. With deep concern for the unity of the church, Paul focused on love between brothers and sisters in Christ: \nLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. \n1 Corinthians 13:4–8a ( New International Version ) \nNow let's take apart the verse and examine each aspect. Love Is Patient \nThis kind of love bears with offenses and is slow to repay or punish those who offend us. However, it does not mean indifference, which would ignore an offense. Love Is Kind \nKindness is similar to patience , but refers to how we treat others. This kind of love may take the form of a gentle rebuke when careful discipline is needed. Love Does Not Envy \nThis kind of love appreciates and rejoices when others are blessed with good things and does not allow jealousy and resentment to take root. Love Does Not Boast \nThe word \"boast\" here means \"bragging without foundation.\" This kind of love does not exalt itself over others. It recognizes that our achievements are not based on our own abilities or worthiness. Love Is Not Proud \nThis love is not overly self-confident or insubordinate to God and others. It is not characterized by a sense of self-importance or arrogance. Love Is Not Rude \nThis kind of love cares about others, their customs, likes and dislikes. It respects the concerns of others even when they are different from our own. Love Is Not Self-Seeking \nThis kind of love puts the good of others before our own good. It places God first in our lives, above our own ambitions. Love Is Not Easily Angered \nLike the characteristic of patience, this kind of love does not rush toward anger when others do wrong. Love Keeps No Record of Wrongs \nThis kind of love offers forgiveness , even when offenses are repeated many times. Love Does Not Delight in Evil But Rejoices With the Truth \nThis kind of love seeks to avoid involvement in evil and help others steer clear of evil, too. It rejoices when loved ones live according to truth. Love Always Protects \nThis kind of love will always expose the sin of others in a safe way that won't bring harm, shame or damage, but will restore and protect. Love Always Trusts \nThis love gives others the benefit of the doubt, trusting in their good intentions. Love Always Hopes \nThis kind of love hopes for the best where others are concerned, knowing God is faithful to complete the work he started in us. This hope encourages others to press forward in the faith. Love Always Perseveres \nThis kind of love endures even through the most difficult trials . Love Never Fails \nThis kind of love goes beyond the boundaries of ordinary love. It is eternal, divine, and will never cease. \nCompare this passage in several popular Bible translations : \n1 Corinthians 13:4–8a ( New International Version )Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. (NIV) \n1 Corinthians 13:4–8a ( English Standard Version )Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. (ESV) \n1 Corinthians 13:4–8a ( New Living Translation )Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance ... love will last forever! (NLT) \n1 Corinthians 13:4–8a ( New King James Version )Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. (NKJV) \n1 Corinthians 13:4–8a ( King James Version )Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth. (KJV) \n1 Corinthians 13:4–8a ( New American Standard Bible )Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. (NASB) \n(Source: Holman New Testament Commentary , Pratt, R.
