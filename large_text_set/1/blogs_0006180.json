Media playback is not supported on this device Eight years after starting discovering it, Alex Pownall says having made a career out of freerunning is \"a dream come true\" \nAccording to Parkour UK, the discipline was founded in France in the 1980s by a group of nine men and named l'art du deplacement. \nThe governing body describes it as a physical discipline in which participants \"move freely over and through any terrain using only the abilities of the body\". \nParkour UK says it \"encourages self-improvement on all levels, revealing one's physical and mental limits while simultaneously offering ways to overcome them\". \nThe term \"freerunning\" was introduced to communicate the sport to an English-speaking audience. Sebastien Foucan has his own freerunning academy in London \nSebastien Foucan, president of Parkour UK, is most recognisable from his role as Mollaka in the opening scene of James Bond's Casino Royale, where he is chased through a building site by Daniel Craig. \nFoucan, who has also appeared music videos for Madonna and stared on Channel 4 documentary Jump London, called the decision a \"groundbreaking moment for a discipline which started off as child's play and continues as child's play - for all ages\". \n\"We celebrate activity and playfulness whilst constantly challenging our mental and physical limits. It is more than just jumping, it is a health driven way of life,\" he added. \nParkour UK chief executive Eugene Minogue said the sport is now in a vast majority of primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, with the UK also boasting 50 Parkour Parks. \nHe added: \"All this in just over seven years , an amazing achievement and testament to the unique and diverse parkour/freerunning community in the UK, which is world leading.\" \nHowever, parkour has faced some criticism for \"potentially jeopardising lives\" and encouraging \"trespassing\". \nThe UK's freerunning community said it was left \"scarred\" after the death of prominent freerunner Nye Newman on New Year's Day. \nThe 17-year-old's parkour group, Brewman, says he died in an accident on the Paris Metro, but denied he was train surfing at the time. How does a sport become recognised? \nThe Council of Europe defines 'sport' as any form of physical activity, casual or organised, aimed at \"expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels\". \nSport England, UK Sport, Sport Northern Ireland, Sport Scotland and Sport Wales refer to this charter when they determine what they officially recognise as a sport. \nThe national governing body of any activity wishing to become an official sport must apply to the home country sports councils. \nSport England says: \"Sports council recognition of a national governing body is not a guarantee of funding and neither does it mean we have approved or accredited the quality of its programmes.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T14:28:45.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
