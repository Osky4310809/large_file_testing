Teasing that March debut is the recently-released trailer, which is essentially an ode to the city. Most notably, there is a scene between Michael Fassbender, who plays a music businessperson, and Natalie Portman, as a waitress, flirting at Asti, the Italian restaurant in Hyde Park. Portman is serving Fassbender a glass of wine. \"Great crew, super nice people,\" Asti owner Emmett Fox said of the experience, to Eater. The filming took place at the restaurant during off-hours. Fox also divulged that Malick set up a temporary office in the same building as the former Fino on San Gabriel Street at the time, and they drank espressos together. A good chunk of the trailer is devoted to musical performances and mosh pits at the now-defunct Fun Fun Fun Fest ( replaced by Sound on Sound) and ACL Fest. There are also scenes at the Long Center, Fassbender against the holiday lights of the Trail of Lights Mozart’s December show , and Ryan Gosling walking down West 4th Street. The rest of the top-notch cast includes Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, and Val Kilmer. Malick had been filming the movie since 2011. It was only until recently that he announced the name. The movie will premiere during SXSW on Friday, March 10, followed by a theatrical release on Friday, March 17.
