Il Corriere dello Sport: #Kessie to #Roma is down to the details, he is close to joining #Roma https://t.co/Weeo2UPiQC — Roma Press (@ASRomaPress) January 29, 2017 The deal, as reported by Corriere dello Sport sounds complicated even by Italian standards. It goes a little something like this: Roma and Atalanta agree on a deal now, but Kessie sees out the season with the latter before joining the former in the summer, but technically only on loan. Roma then have until the summer of 2018 to pay the €25m transfer fee. There’s also a youth prospect to be named later going in the opposite direction. If none of that makes any sense to you, you’re not alone. Beyond just the overly elaborate arrangements, the €25m fee is ridiculous considering that Atalanta had supposedly rejected bids of £20m and £27m from Chelsea and were supposedly holding out for €40m. Maybe Roma are getting some sort of local discount. Or maybe the fees are more involved than that. Either way, this isn’t the last twist in the tale, I don’t think.
