About a week later, the company also released Nougat for the One M9 , while the unlocked One A9 devices started getting the update yesterday.\nIn Europe, HTC users are still waiting for the Nougat update , which is apparently just around the corner. Graham Wheeler, the Product and Service Director at HTC EMEA, took to Twitter to announce that the unlocked European HTC 10 devices will get Android Nougat within the next two weeks. Additionally, the HTC One M9 will also get bumped up to Nougat in the same timeframe.\n\nHTC is also working closely with operators in order to send the update to the carrier variants of both devices at roughly the same time. After the company updates both the 10 and One M9 in Europe, the next smartphone on the list is the One A9. Apparently, HTC is already working on the update for the device, however, it did not specify an exact time frame as to when it might be available.\nSee also: Nougat update will roll out to the unlocked HTC One A9 starting tonight 2 days ago It’s nice to hear that HTC will roll out Android Nougat to a few of its devices in Europe soon. Big updates like these are very important for users as they can change the look and feel of a device quite a bit, and make it a lot more fun to play around with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T09:50:45.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
