Gemma wants to lose weight so she can fall pregnant (Photo: Supplied by WENN) \n\"Everything's good Charlie, I still haven't met the love of my life yet. Being the new found woman that I am, I've decided to take the route of freezing my eggs,\" she told him on camera. \n\"But you know, if you are overweight and you're trying to have a baby, you're at a 40 per cent chance, basically. So less than half way. \n\"I need to lose weight,\" she finished. \nPersonal trainer Chalie said he'd be willing to help Gemma achieve her dreams but grilled her on her current lifestyle, asking when she'd last had a takeaway. The star has been losing weight week-on-week (Photo: DC) Gemma has struggled with her weight for years, especially while on TOWIE \n\"Yesterday, because you know what Charlie, I'd gone all day without eating,\" she told him, adding that she'd rather phone up for a Chinese than mess up her kitchen by cooking. \nCharlie warned that she was making excuses for her poor dietary choices and told her to \"sort it\". \n\"If I had the body to match I'd be the fittest girl in Essex, I know I would,\" she said. \n\"I'd be pregnant in five minutes.\" The star says she'd fall pregnant \"in five minutes\" if she was at a healthy weight (Photo: DC) \nJust last week on the ITVBe show, Gemma was shown sobbing as she spoke to a fertility doctor about getting her eggs frozen. \nThe 36-year-old was told her time was running out as she was already at the top end of the age bracket for fertility treatment, something she wasn't aware of before speaking to her consultant. \n\"I'm living in this sheer panic morning, noon and night,\" she said while drying her tears with a tissue. Gemma went to a fertility clinic to find out about egg-freezing (Photo: Supplied by WENN) She got emotional as she was told her age might be a factor in her lack of success with conceiving (Photo: Supplied by WENN) \n\"Firstly because I'm worried I'm already going through the menopause; secondly 'why haven't I found the love of my life?'; and thirdly I'm asking, 'why me'? \n\"So I think if I can freeze my eggs I've got a better chance later on,\" she told the sympathetic doctor. \nIt comes as Gemma was rumoured to be back with her ex-fiance Rami Hawash earlier this month after she was spotted wearing the engagement ring he'd given her back in 2014. \n\"Gemma and Rami are essentially back together,\" a source told The Sun. \n\"They haven't put a label on their relationship yet but Gemma is in love with him and she's told her closest friends how happy she is.\" \nShe's yet to publicly confirm the rumours.
