Today's task: studio apartments in NYC for sale for $350,000 or less . ↑ Located right across from the United Nations Headquarters building, this Tudor City studio on the 19th floor of a prewar building packs in a lot for its tiny space—most notably a Murphy bed hidden behind sliding doors. Other nice features here include the beamed ceilings and the hardwood floors. Amenities in the building include the spacious roof deck, a fitness room, and laundry. It can be yours for $328,000. [ Floorplan ] ↑ For just $215,000 this Park Slope studio is offering hardwood floors, moldings, a windowed bathroom, and a good amount of closet space for a unit of this size. The co-op is located in an elevator building that also has a laundry facility in the basement. An added bonus is the fact it’s just a block away from Prospect Park. There is one major caveat however: it can only be purchased in an all cash deal. [ Floorplan ] ↑ This charming, bookshelf-clad co-op in Yorkville on the Upper East Side is asking $335,000. Though it’s not set up that way right now, the brokerbabble says that the nook off of the living room is large enough to fit a queen-sized bed or a Murphy bed. The floor-to-ceiling bookcases however are the best selling point for this studio. [ Floorplan ] ↑ Located on the top floor of a six-story building in Prospect Heights, this studio is on the market for $299,000. The apartment features high ceilings, hardwood floors, and a separate kitchen. It also sits across from Prospect Park and is a short walk to the Brooklyn Museum.
