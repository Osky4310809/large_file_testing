It’s hard to imagine what that amount of plastic trash even looks like, but we can tell you what happens to it. First, most of our plastic trash ends up in landfills. From there, it makes its way to our oceans where it becomes a life or death problem for the ocean’s inhabitants. It’s easy for animals who eat jellyfish to mistake floating plastic bags for their prey of choice and animals like sea lions, seals, and otters run the risk of becoming tangled. On top of that, 800 marine species are at risk of extinction because of plastic. It’s a tough fact to face, but luckily, it’s easily resolved by swapping plastic bags for reusable shopping bags. \n\nWe all know we should bring our own bags but, sometimes, things like this happen… It’s not your usual grocery shopping day, but you need to just stop by the store to pick up a few things. When you get to the register, the cashier asks “paper or plastic?” and that’s when the realization hits you — you left your reusable grocery shopping bag at home! Yeah, we’ve all been there before. Insulated bags are great for planned shopping trips, but for emergencies, it’s good to have something that will always be in your backpack, purse, or briefcase. Thankfully, we don’t have to suffer the eco-embarrassment of resorting to choosing a single-use bag because there are reusable bags out there that can carry your groceries and fold up to the size of a wallet when not in use. 1.
