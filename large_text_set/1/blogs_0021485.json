Related Here's Everything That Happened at Jay Z's 'Get Out the Vote' Concert for Hillary Clinton Jay Z publicly supported Hillary Clinton on her campaign trail, and even held a special concert in Cleveland just a few days before Election Day. Trump later criticized Clinton and Jay Z for the language (re: lyrics) used at the event, though he did admit, \"I actually like Jay Z.\" Maybe this reporter was hoping to get a juicy sound bite from Jay. In the end they just ruined it for everyone else. Trump questions aside, it appears the premiere and post-conversation with the series creators and executives went smoothly. Doug E. Fresh even stopped by to congratulate Jay Z on his success and promoting a positive image. You can check out some photos and videos of the event below. \n#JayZ at the world premier of 'Time: The Kalief Browder Story' #Sundance pic.twitter.com/pISpTg9dwA — Salonge Knowles (@saltrejo) January 26, 2017 \nThe premier of The Kalief Browder Story was heavy.
