During Jimmy's opening monologue, the late-night host couldn't help but poke fun at his frenemy. After making a few cheap digs about his appearance, he went all in as he critiqued his decision to star in The Great Wall over the Oscar-nominated Manchester by the Sea . \"He handed that part to his friend and took a Chinese ponytail movie,\" he said, referencing best actor nominee Casey Affleck . \"That movie went on to lose $80 million. Smooth move, dumbass.\" Ouch! We can't wait to see what other hilarious jokes Jimmy will come up with during the show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:31:54.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
