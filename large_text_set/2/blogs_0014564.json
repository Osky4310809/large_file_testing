There’s a massive crowd here and it’s not setting a good example.” \nLewandowski's goal six minutes into added time at the end of the game cancelled out Vedad Ibisevic's first-half opener for Hertha. \nIt helped Bayern open up an eight-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga, which was closed back down to five after RB Leipzig's 2-1 win over Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday. poll loading Will Bayern Munich win the Bundesliga this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T19:33:23.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
