I’m saving a lot of money and meeting a lot of people who will be able to help me get there.” \nBut there are more than 200 students all over the Adams 12 Five Star School District each school year who aren’t as clear on what to do after graduation because they weren’t able to get into Bollman in their last few years of schooling. \nThe Bollman Technical Education Center at 9451 Washington St. isn’t big enough to accommodate every kid in the district who wants to get into some of the 20 career and technical education classes offered at the adjunct district program, which opened in 1974. \nSince 2012, about 1,213 students have been turned away from Bollman due to lack of space. \n“We try to be inclusive, but at the same time we only have so many seats, so we try to think about what student is going to get the most benefit from the seats that we have,” said Janet Renden, principal of Bollman Technical Education Center. “The amount of kids we couldn’t accommodate in the last five years is huge, unfortunately.” Kathryn Scott, YourHub Student nursing assistants Lorraine Harvey, 18, left, and Nissa Rodriguez, 18, run through their practicum on proper patient mouth care during their morning class at Bollman Technical Education Center on February 23, 2017 in Thornton. \nBut all that is changing now that district voters passed a $350 million bond last year. Some of that money will go to build a second career and technical education campus in the northern region of the district within two years. \n“The district does provide transportation in between every class period between all of our comprehensive high schools and our alternate high school, so locating the new campus up north will help with that travel time,” Renden said. “Kids coming here from Horizon High School, for example, have to take a lot more time out of their days just to get here and back. There’s also the expectation that building the school north will help alleviate some of the crowding in that region.” \nAbout $4 million in bond money will also be used to make improvements at Bollman. \n“We turn away so many kids,” said Ian Matje, a diesel automotive technician and Bollman teacher. “I started out this year with 90 kids, and I’m the only instructor (for diesel). Auto turns away like 200 kids a year. There’s so much demand for these classes, but it’s kind of hard to cram any more kinds in here.” \nThe new career and technical education campus is slated to open fall 2019 and will accommodate 80 percent more students across the district in career and technical education opportunities. \n“This is where I started out, too — in my high school shop class,” Matje said. “It’s really helpful for these kids because you can get a high-paying job right out of the box. We partner with RTD, which still offers pensions. They start out at $24 an hour and it’s not flat rate. Being 17 or 18 year old and being paid $24 an hour is hard to beat.” \nIt’s very common for Bollman students to progress in their careers quickly once they leave high school. \n“Last year, my students were doing clinicals for two weeks at (an assisted living facility), and the director of nursing really liked our students and wanted to interview them,” said Kathy Blackmon,a registered nurse and Bollman Medical Sciences instructor. “Eight of my students wanted to be interviewed. She hired all of them right there. They paid them $15 an hour, and then when they graduated from high school they went and got their licenses and then got a bump in pay.” \nProjected enrollment for Bollman career and technical education classes throughout Adams 12 for 2019 is 1,950 students. Classes at Bollman are available students in all five district high schools. \n“It would be nice to see more of these classes because we have so much interest,” Blackmon said. “Right now, there are 200 medical sciences students who either want to go to EMT or CNA classes. There are only 50 spots for us though.” \nThere have been three building additions to Bollman from 1975 to 1991, bringing the total size of the dual building campus to about 65,000 square feet. The new campus in the north region of the district is tentatively planned to be about 40,000 square feet. \nThe district has formed a committee that meets once a week with partnership organizations to discuss the needs and future of the new campus. Among the early items on the “needs list” is more space for the medical and automotive classes, as well as new programming for an unspecified fabrication program to meet workforce demands in Adams County. \n“We’re going to spend a lot of time now getting feedback from parent, from the industry and also from kids who have left Bollman and received jobs in their field,” Marvin Lewis, Bollman assistant principal. “We want that feedback on how the program could be better from the perspective of someone who’s lived it. We really want to get this right, from the programming to the use of building space itself.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:08:08.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
