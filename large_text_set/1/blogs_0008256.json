The Friday farewell jam featured the likes of hometown star Wale , Chance The Rapper, Solange Knowles, Usher, LaLa Anthony, J. Cole and several others. \nAccording to a sweep of social media, Solange performed at the event and posted a photo of her soundcheck ahead of the performance. Wale and Chance are familiar faces at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and while cameras and cell phones weren‚Äôt allowed inside the party, most of the attendees documented the event via their respective pages. \nAlong with the aforementioned, Kelly Rowland, Chris Rock, Jay Pharaoh , John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen, George and Amal Clooney, Nick Jonas and Jill Scott were some of the other attendees for the private event. \n‚ÄúThe sound check of life‚Ä¶Was truly the ultimate, ultimate honor. Can‚Äôt even put into words. Really. We will miss your excellence, your grace, and the phenomenal legacy you have let us all share,‚Äù wrote Solange in one of the few photos available from inside the event.
