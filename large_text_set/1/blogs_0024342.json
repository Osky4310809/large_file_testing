Denver Broncos receivers Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders, Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen, Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier and Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker joined Mickey Mouse , NFL cheerleaders and more. \n\nConfetti rained down on the players, cheering park guests lined the iconic street and red, white and blue balloons added a special welcome to these football heroes who are just days away from the 2017 Pro Bowl right here in Orlando! \n\nAfter the parade, Greg Olsen enjoyed some time in the parks with his family, creating even more memories that will last a lifetime. \nToday’s parade was just one of the many events happening throughout Walt Disney World Resort and Central Florida as part of the NFL Pro Bowl’s celebration of football at all levels.\n\nIf you haven’t had a chance to get involved in the fun, there are still plenty of opportunities, including a 5K at Epcot , the Pro Bowl Experience and team practices at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and the Pro Bowl Bash at Disney Springs .
