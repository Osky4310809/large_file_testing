PBS reported that in 2015 a similar bill was brought before the Texas House of Representatives but never got anywhere.   \nFlorida has a similar law (“Docs vs. Glocks”) on the books — a law that The Washington Post reported was upheld by the 11th Circuit Court. \nIt is unclear if the Texas law will get anywhere now that a pro-Second Amendment president will be occupying the White House. Of course, one day Democrats might get someone elected president again, so it might be useful to have this law on the books for when that day arrives. \nJust because Trump will be in the White House doesn’t mean that the fight over the Second Amendment is over. Liberals will constantly be looking for new ways to inflict gun control upon Americans, so we should be on the lookout for anything they might try. \nShare this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think doctors should and should not be able to ask you.
