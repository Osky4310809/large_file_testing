TBH, if anyone deserves a vacation right now, it’s the Obamas, and their vacation looks seriously dreamy . Based on the Obama vacation photos, they’re getting all the relaxation they need and more!\nAccording to our friends over at ELLE , our favorite first couple (like, truly, have you heard the Obama love story ?!) ventured off to Palm Springs post-inauguration, and the headed to the British Virgin Islands, landing in Necker Island, which is owned by billionaire Richard Branson. Like, casual. Please, please take us with you!!\nMichelle let us know that she and Barack were headed on a break with this tweet she sent on inauguration day. After an extraordinary 8 years, I'll be taking a little break. Will be back before you know it to work with you on the issues we care about. pic.twitter.com/o0ECJitXnw \n— Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) January 20, 2017 While Obama let us know he’ll be a regular ol’ citizen just like us. I won't stop; I'll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love.\n— President Obama (@POTUS44) January 20, 2017 Which, apparently, means looking ~fly as hell~ in a backwards baseball cap?!! Obama really in the BVI in flip flops just chillin pic.twitter.com/k1zb1Z3bQ2 \n— Amat Victoria Curamॐ (@BR_Nation) February 1, 2017 The Obama vacation photos are literally everything as more. They look chill AF! WE ARE NOT WORTHY. Obama's on vacation with the hat backwards. He's never coming back. pic.twitter.com/RUakcwwgtT \n— Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) February 1, 2017 We are absolutely obsessed with these looks. We hope you two are having so much fun! But like, not too much! We still need you!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:59:31.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
