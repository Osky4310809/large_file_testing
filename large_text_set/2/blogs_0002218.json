(Stephen M. Dowell / Orlando Sentinel) Chris Hays ,' \" Williams said. \"It was me and my mom and my dad talking to him on the phone, and me and my dad jumped up off the couch when he said, 'We expect you to play against Penn State.' \"\nWilliams has had a frustrating ride through the recruiting process. \nIt was all good at first. He was on a college tour two summers ago — hosted by Top Recruits Now and its founder A.G. Waseem — when he impressed coaches so much that he picked up three offers from North Carolina, NC State and Kentucky. He was headed into his junior year at Orlando University High and things were looking great. \nPicture gallery of Andre Williams, WR, Winter Park, a transfer from Orlando University High, Class of 2017 (Chris Hays) \nThen he broke his ankle and missed his junior season. The phone stopped ringing and the offers stopped coming. He has waited and waited to hear from someone, and Thursday the 5-foot-10, 170-pound pass catcher finally got that call. \n\"It was real hard for all of us going through this. It was real frustrating,\" Williams said of his family. \"Sophomore year I'm having Power 5 offers and then everybody forgetting about it and no one looks at me. ... As soon as we heard we were ecstatic the whole time.\" \nHe was happy for his teammates Wednesday, but he couldn't help but think about why he wasn't joining them.

Your time is going to come. Everything happens for a reason. You're in God's hands,' and so that's how I took it. \n\"I made sure not to get down on myself. There were times I got down, but then I'd always have to check myself, like, 'Something is going to happen.' \" \nIn the spring, he transferred to Winter Park and began the process of making sure everyone knew he still had it despite missing his junior season. He showed the broken ankle had not changed him. His routes were crisp, his speed was still there and his hands ... well, his hands have never been a problem. \nBowden didn't the lack of size stop him from taking a look at Williams. He doesn't look at size as something that should be held against a player. He knows from his own experience as a player at West Virginia back in the day. Coach Bowden stands about 5-foot-6. He's given opportunities to other, vertically challenged Central Florida players before. \nFormer Oveido athlete A.J. Coney, 5-foot-8, 180, is coming off his redshirt junior season at Akron. He's played 24 games for the Zips and caught 26 passes for nearly 300 yards and two touchdowns. \nOn Thursday, Winter Park head coach Tim Shifflet spend some time on the phones again, looking for a coach who would give Williams a shot. \nBowden got the word, called Shifflet, and Bowden listened. \nNow Williams can look to his own future at Akron. \n\"I just pushed it through because I knew something would happen eventually and Akron called me,\" Williams said, \"So now every single school we're playing against when I'm at Akron, I'm taking it as, 'You guys passed me up, so I'm playing with a chip on my shoulder, every game, as big as a house.' \" \nWilliams had a solid senior season in an offense that was geared more toward the run. He had 39 catches for 574 yards and six touchdowns. He also played some running back and carried the ball on several jets sweeps from the slot. He rushed for 183 yards and three touchdowns on 30 touches. He also had 420 yards and three more touchdowns on punt and kickoff returns. \nHe was especially impressed that Bowden, the head coach himself, made the phone call. \n\"I didn't really know a lot about the history of the Bowdens and everything, but my dad, he's a big sports fan and stuff and he said, 'That's a big deal right there,' \" Williams said. \n\nChris Hays is the Sentinel's recruiting coverage coordinator and can be reached at .
