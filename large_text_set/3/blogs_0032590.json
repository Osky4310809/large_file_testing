Flynn’s Lawyer Says ‘Discussions Have Taken Place’ A statement by counsel to General Flynn. pic.twitter.com/JQs90OI2OY \n— Robert Kelner (@robkelner) March 30, 2017 \nAfter the report in The Wall Street Journal, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, released a statement o n Twitter that confirmed “discussions have taken place” although it doesn’t specifically use the word immunity. \n“Out of respect for the Committees, we will not comment right now on the details of discussions between counsel for General Flynn and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, other than to confirm that those discussions have taken place. But it is important to acknowledge the circumstances in which those discussions are occurring.” \nThe letter then lists Flynn’s accomplishments, calling him a “highly decorated 33-year veteran of the U.S. Army. He devoted most of his life to serving his country, spending many years away from his family fighting this nation’s battles around the world.” 3. Flynn’s Lawyer Saved His Harshest Criticism for the Media & Flynn Previously Said a Grant of Immunity Is an Indication a Crime Was Committed Flynn and Trump at a campaign rally. (Getty) \nAccording to NBC , in September, Flynn told Chuck Todd on Meet the Press, “When you are given immunity that means you’ve probably committed a crime.” NBC reported that Flynn was talking about Hillary Clinton when he made that remark.

Rather, it excoriates the media for peddling “unfounded allegations” of treason against Flynn. \nThe letter said “the media are awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason, and vicious innuendo directed against” Flynn. \n“He is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated. No reasonable person who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.” 4. Flynn Acknowledged Not Fully Briefing Pence on His Conversations With the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. (Russian embassy) \nFlynn served as Trump’s national security adviser for only 24 days when he became ensnared in controversy over the nature of conversations he had with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, after the election but before Trump took the oath of office. \nFlynn spoke with the Russian ambassador about sanctions against Russia shortly before Trump took office, contrary to past denials, The Washington Post reported shortly before Flynn resigned. \nThe New York Times ran a similar report, saying Flynn spoke with Kislyak about sanctions and cooperation between the two countries in the month before Trump was inaugurated and while Barack Obama was still in the White House. The newspaper quoted unnamed officials as saying the conversations were “inappropriate” and indicated there were transcripts because the government engages in eavesdropping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:54:46.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
