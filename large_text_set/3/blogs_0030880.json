SO. SERIOUS??! REUTERS \nThe new bust is the second such statue of Ronaldo to look all kinds of awful. In case you don’t remember, Cristiano had his likeness immortalized in a statue erected (all puns intended) in his city of birth, Funchal… \nWITH AN ENORMOUS, BULGING PENIS. REUTERS \nThe most recent bust was unveiled during a renaming ceremony of Portugal’s Madeira International Airport. \nFrom now on, the airport will be called Aeroporto Cristiano Ronaldo. \nThis is a huge honor, but the real talk of the town is this scary bust, which probably belongs in the Haunted Mansion.
