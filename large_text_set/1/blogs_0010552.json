Mansfield and Spruce Peak — has been open in the senator’s home state of Vermont since 1936. The 116-trailed octogenarian has since gone through many, many changes and today, after a few nip/tucks on everything from the high-speed lifts to the lodge and spa over the years, it remains the No. 1 ski spot in the eyes of many of the glossies that still bother to rank such things in the Web 2.0 era.\nEven better news for impatient New Yorkers (forgive the redundancy): The resort town can now be gotten to directly by commercial plane for the first time in over three decades.\nA surprisingly affordable private-ish plane, to boot.\nTradewind’s fancy-pants leather seats. Tradewind Aviation Once upon a time, Stowe’s little airstrip-that-could — the Morrisville-Stowe State Airport — had been reachable by the now-defunct Vermont Air from JFK. When that airline croaked in ’84, you could no longer boogie over on a commercial flight. Meanwhile, weeds and other chloroplastic invaders burst through the airport’s ever-cracking asphalt like something out of a horror movie.\nThat, alternatively, left Stowe-bound skiers with a 90-minute flight into Burlington followed by a nearly hour-long road trip.\nWhich begged the question: Why don’t we just not ?\nBut a few years ago, a local local lawyer (and father of an aspiring aviator) named Russell Barr couldn’t bear to watch Stowe’s airstrip languish any longer. So he founded Stowe Aviation and, with a financial assist from the gubmint, spent $27 million mowing, repaving and expanding what was more your stoner neighbor’s unkempt front lawn than usable tarmac. By the summer of 2014, Barr had restored the airport to its former glory and then some.\nNot long after, in the fall of 2015, a small charter flight company, Tradewind Aviation — co-run by the Zipkin Bros., Eric and David — started flying directly between New York City (errr, Westchester County Airport in White Plains, but close enough) and Stowe; currently the only airline doing so.\nTheir preferred bird of choice? Pilatus PC-12 propjets. Thug life.\nThe 75-minute scheduled shuttle is only moderately more expensive than what the major air carriers will shake you down for into Burlington (from $250 one-way — or you can always splurge on their on-demand private charter service, starting with a $50K deposit).\nBottom line: Shuttling to Stowe means no TSA lines (enjoy a private lounge-sporting FBO terminal). Shuttling means you’ll likely fly with only those you wish to (choose wisely, the plane seats eight passengers, max). Shuttling means nice, clean seats (leather, wood trim). Shuttling means you’re only 20 some-odd minutes from the white stuff upon wheels-down.\nShuttling means good.\n\nForget the one on her finger -- this shredding bride prefers diamonds of the black variety.
