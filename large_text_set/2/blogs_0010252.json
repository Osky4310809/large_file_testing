She nailed it in a sexy, sheer Julien Macdonald number. The high-octane ensemble was just as fierce as the singer herself, with a crochet-like texture that wove in some glitzy metallic elements.\nAnd with that ultra-feisty, décolletage-baring neckline offset by the plunging backless portion of the dress, the singer was nothing short of sizzling.\nWhile it was difficult to look away from the “Confident” singer’s skin-tight, rock’n’roll-perfect dress, a careful eye will note that Demi had equally killer hair and makeup tonight.
