What exactly did this man drink to get himself in this situation? Could there possibly be enough tequila in England to blame? Where are his socks? Where are his companions? Was this a dare gone very wrong? Did this man really get this smashed alone? Were other local bar urinals checked to make sure this isn't some sort of sick new social media trend? Is this planking 2.0? \nFinally, this bright yellow Hawaiian shirt with parrot pattern sleevesâ€”why? This man did not pick this out without some sort of deliberate intention. \nThere are at least 500 different places that come to mind as a better place to pass out than in the urinal of a bar. Nope. 10,000. Actually, there isn't really a worse place to pass out. But as Baines puts so eloquently, \"Looking at it forces us to catalogue every misdemeanor that we memorially attribute to the corrosive effects of a pint or nine.\" \nSo thank you, guy, for reminding us that no matter what we've done in a drunken stupor, no matter the regret or photographic evidence, we still have never woken up in a urinal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:05:17.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
