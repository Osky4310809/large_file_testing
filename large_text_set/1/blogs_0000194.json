This is also a man who spent the election season waving his banner of Hillary Clinton support .\nInclude women in the sequel. #WORK @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/mRcX5GPGzs \n— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) July 12, 2016 \nThat support went both ways, too, with HRC not only attending Hamilton multiple times, but even quoting it in her speech at the Democratic National Convention this summer.\nSo what’s Lin-Manuel up to after the world turned upside down? In addition to taking on a sizeable chunk of all the movies Disney has in the hopper, he’s not giving up the political fight. The way he describes it (in a fantastic interview with The Daily Beast ) he woke up the day after the election with “a very pronounced case of moral clarity.” One that made it clear he’s not backing down.\nIn addition to the disappointment, it was like, oh, this does not change the things that I believe in. The things that I believe in that this candidate doesn’t means we’re going to have to fight for them. You don’t want to go backwards when it comes to our LGBT brothers and sisters; you don’t want to go backwards when it comes to the disenfranchisement of voters of color. We have to keep fighting for the things we believe in, and it just made that very clear: I know who I am, and I know what I’m going to fight for in the years to come. That felt like the tonic of it.\nAnd what form is that fight taking? Among other things, it turns out Miranda’s got a pretty cool connection to Planned Parenthood.\nPeople are going to believe what they’re going to believe. For me, my mother is on the board of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and my mother has her own personal stories with Planned Parenthood. That’s an organization that’s really saved lives time and again. The thing it’s controversial for [abortion] is a very small part of the health services it provides, and so, like I said, this is a way to support something that is so important. It’s a no-brainer, and the fun bonus is that my mom gets to look like the cool board member because of our efforts. I’m happy to support it, and that’s just that. Women’s health is a priority, it’s worth protecting, and if I can be of service in that way, then that’s how I’ll be of service. Full stop.\nThat bit about making his mom look like the “cool board member.” That has to be true. Miranda has utilized his insane success to benefit Planned Parenthood on a number of occasions, including a campaign going on right now, offering a chance to win a trip to see Hamilton in three different cities with backstage privileges at each. Oh, and there are some super cool donation prizes in that campaign, including this entirely appropriate magnet.\n(Via Prizeo )\nI have no trouble believing that’s 100% true.\n \n(via The Daily Beast , featured image via Shutterstock)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
