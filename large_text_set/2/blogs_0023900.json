Pinchos are traditionally pierced with a cocktail stick, to attach it to the piece of bread that they invariably came attached to. However, as Basque cuisine has evolved, the food is now less likely to be pierced to a piece of bread than before. \nI'll leave it you to decide if the deliberate bastardization of a Spanish word when there is probably a perfectly legitimate Basque equivalent is done to deliberately bait the Spanish or not! \nSee also: What does Tapas Actually Mean? And is 'tapas' singular or plural? What's the Difference Between Pintxos (or Pinchos) and Tapas? \nThe difference between a pincho and a tapa is complicated and depends largely on context and location in Spain. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Tips to Make Coach Feel Like First Class \nA significant minority of Spaniards (well, I've come across more than one myself) who have not traveled extensively within their own country have the idea that a pincho is paid for and a tapa is always free. This is simply not true. \nThe basic uses of 'pincho', 'pintxo', and 'tapa' are as follows: In the Basque Country , you are served 'pintxos' . It is never written 'pinchos' and they are never called 'tapas'. This is the case regardless of whether it is served 'pinchado' to a piece of bread with a cocktail stick or not.

In Salamanca , particularly on Calle Van Dyck, you are served pinchos . They are almost always a piece of meat served on a piece of bread. Though not actually 'pinchado' with a stick, this is still close to the original idea of what a 'pincho' is. However, here they are free . In Granada and Leon (and in some other nearby cities) as well as in some bars in Madrid , a small portion, whether served on bread or not, is a tapa . It is free. In Seville and other parts of Andalusia , all small portions are called 'tapas' . They are not free. In many cities in Spain, particularly Madrid , a large portion of, say, calamares, will be called a 'ración', with a half-size portion called a 'media ración' and a quarter-size portion a 'tapa' . In most parts of Spain, when trying to informally say 'a bit of', for example \"Can I have a bit of tortilla please?\" you will ask for a 'pincho' - so 'un pincho de tortilla'. How to Order Pintxos in the Basque Country \nOne of the 'novelties' of pintxos is that you don't order , you take . It's not the most hygienic practice in the world, but it's a bit of fun to order your beer and just start nibbling at what you see on the bar. You then normally just tell them at the end how many you've had and the barman will charge you accordingly. \nHowever, it is not always done like this. In some bars, the barman can be very protective of his pintxos, you have to ask . How do you know whether you can help yourself or not? Well, it seems that the Basques have a psychic connection with their pintxos - they just know . For the rest of us, I found that a good tip is to ask for a plate (' ¿Tienes un plato? ' tee-EN-es oon PLA-to) - if the barman just gives you a plate, you are free to help yourself. If he holds onto it and looks at you expectantly, it's time for you start pointing!
