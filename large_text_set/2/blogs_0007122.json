The mastermind behind the decor was none other than multi-disciplinary artist, and longtime Raf collaborator, Sterling Ruby , who was given free rein to imagine the space, and served as the first in a trilogy of installations by the artist for Calvin Klein.\nThe 10:00 AM function (which of course started late) was met with industry big wigs far and wide, who shuffled through crowds of eager non-invitees who cluttered the sidewalks outside, hoping to catch a glimpse of the many glitterati, such as A$AP Rocky and Stranger Things ‚Äòs Millie Bobby Brown , that came to show their support for Raf on his big day.\n$tranger Thing$ have happened‚Ä¶ @milliebbrown #ASAPRocky at #RafSimons debut for #CalvinKlein pic.twitter.com/4KFrYe4zLF \n‚Äî Nico Amarca¬Æ (@guidogoth) February 10, 2017 \n\nOnce the air kisses and influx of social media fodder from giddy attendees dyed down, sweaty publicists assertively ushered everyone to man their posts so that we could actually begin to see what we all came for ‚Äì the clothing (this was a fashion show, after all).\nThe track that opened the show was also the one that closed it, starting with a eerie rework of ‚ÄúThis Is Not America‚Äù followed by David Bowie and Pat Metheny Group‚Äôs 1985 original .\nIn a similar vein to what largely inspired the ‚ÄúI Heart NY‚Äù motifs found in his own label‚Äôs FW17 line, Raf‚Äôs CK debut was yet another ode to his newfound American residency, only this time, the references tapped a much broader view of the Land of Stars and Stripes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the future, the past Art Deco, the city, the American West‚Äù Raf states in the press notes. ‚ÄúNot one era, not one thing, not one look. It is the coming together of different characters and different individuals, just like America itself.‚Äù\nPretty in Plastic #RafSimons debut #CalvinKlein #nyfw \nA video posted by Nico aMarca (@sinisterminister_) on Feb 10, 2017 at 8:33am PST \n\nCK sartorial hallmarks were commonplace, yet Raf‚Äôs discernibly European quirks were noticed immediately. Suits were tailored in a way that hugged nearly every (non-existent) curve of each model‚Äôs waifish physique, though they still struggled to fill them out completely. Primary-colored Western shirts were given contrasting pocket details. Greaser biker jackets were de-masculinized via floral embroidery and cropped sleeves. Knitted varsity sleeves were stitched onto sheer nude tube tops.\nThe most interesting Raf touch was the ample use of plastic lamination, which glossed over everything from plaid topcoats to dresses plastered with exotic bird feathers. Then, of course, you had your dark-washed denim offerings, which were perhaps the least tampered with staple synonymous with Klein‚Äôs namesake, and offered an endearing wink to those racy Brooke Shields ads that brought the brand to prominence in the early ‚Äô80s.\nThough tropes of Lynchian Americana sprung to mind almost immediately, this vision of America belonged completely to Raf. In a time where socio-political turmoil has the citizens of this country divided on where they stand when it comes to national identity, Raf is finding tremendous inspiration in his ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù homecoming, and at the same time, is restoring the beauty and hopefulness that have made America the beacon of multicultural unity for all these years.\nThe Man, The Myth #RafSimons #CalvinKlein #nyfw \nA video posted by Nico aMarca (@sinisterminister_) on Feb 10, 2017 at 8:55am PST \n\nFor more coverage of FW17 Fashion Week be sure to read our other reports on today‚Äôs hottest brands . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T21:36:40.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
