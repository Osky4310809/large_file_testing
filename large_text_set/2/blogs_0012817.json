Share Labour's Stoke Central candidate tore into the Ukip leader (Photo: Daily Mirror) Share Get politics   Thank you for subscribing!   \nUKIP leader Paul Nuttall should “sod off back to where he came from” and stop trying to exploit Brexit in a crunch by-election, Labour’s candidate sensationally stormed. \nMild-mannered Gareth Snell tore into Mr Nuttall, insisting he had no ties to Stoke-on-Trent. \nThe pair go head to head on February 23 in a poll showdown where Labour is desperately defending a 5,179 majority. \nLiverpudlian Mr Nuttall is tipped to win the constituency, where nearly 70% of voters opted to Leave the EU. \nBut, speaking exclusively to the Mirror, Mr Snell fumed: “Stoke is a convenient stop for Paul Nuttall on his way to Westminster. Ukip's Paul Nuttall has no links to the area (Photo: PA) \n“If someone can tell me he has a genuine love for The Potteries I will be amazed. \n“There are plenty of campaigns he could have been involved when he was an MEP – he has not had any interest in them whatsoever. \n“All of a sudden, because there was a big Leave vote and a timely parliamentary by-election, he wants to brand himself Mr Stoke. \n“Paul has come here to make his name, I came here to make my life.

(Photo: Daily Mirror) \nMr Snell said: “He’s been sent packing from other parliamentary constituencies. \n“Win or lose, I’m not going anywhere whereas I suspect if Paul Nuttall loses, come February 24 he will be on the first train back to Liverpool.” \nStoke’s “reputation would be inherently damaged” if Mr Nuttall wins, his rival warned. \n“Business would suffer, the reputation of Stoke would take nosedive,” he feared. \n“For too long Stoke has had a reputation as being somewhere that is on the decline, and that’s wrong because actually the city has an awful lot to offer. \n“We’ve got so much going for us but that will be overshadowed if we have a UKIP MP that says, ‘It’s all about Brexit and that’s why I’m your MP’.” (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nWhile June’s referendum had “not shot UKIP’s fox”, he urged voters to look beyond Brexit when they cast their ballot. \n“We’re not interested in rehashing the debate that’s just been had,” insisted Mr Snell, who backed Remain and once tweeted that Brexit was “a massive pile of s***”. \nHe now vows to support leaving the EU, saying: “I recognise the vote we had in the referendum was quite strong for Leave here.” \nHe even praised Mr Corbyn for forcing Labour MPs to back triggering Article 50, deepening Labour’s civil war. \n“We’re a democratic party and we have to respect what the wishes of our voters are,” said Mr Snell. \n“Jeremy got it right.” Gareth Snell is running to replace Tristram Hunt (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nHis support for the party leader is significant; last year he branded Mr Corbyn an “IRA supporting friend of Hamas”. \nMr Snell also fears some disillusioned Labour supporters could actually hand victory to Theresa May by switching to UKIP. \nWhile UKIP was second in the seat in 2015, the Tories were only 33 votes behind.

It makes no difference to me that he’s not from round here – he’s still British. I voted to get out of the EU and I think UKIP will be better for Brexit .” (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nNursery nurse Hayley Ellams, 22, said: “I will probably vote Labour – my parents are voting Labour. I wanted us to stay in the EU - I don’t like Brexit , or Donald Trump for that matter. I don’t think being outside the EU will do anything for us. Labour are obviously more pro-EU than UKIP, so they will probably be getting my vote.” (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nRetired potteries worker Jeff Turner, 62, said: “I’ll be voting for UKIP. They’re fairer and will try and sort out things I agree with like the NHS and housing. Nigel Farage started Brexit and we will better off. I’ve never voted Labour and I don’t agree with what they’re putting forward. I don’t think a lot of Jeremy Corbyn – he’s a bit silly.” (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nRetired off licence manager Helen Morton, 61, said: “I haven’t decided yet. They all say they’re going to do things before the election but then we don’t seem for the next 12 months. Brexit will be good for this country – think of the millions we have been paying the EU only to put the money back here. But it’s not all about Brexit for me.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:22:28.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
