House of Representatives \nIvwurie, who had assured that the House would look into the two petitions in line with relevant laws, expressed concern that the university did not follow due process in taking sensitive decisions that affected the students. \nHe said: “It is more worrisome that the university’s Vice Chancellor did not appear before the Public Petitions Committee of the House or send a representative despite invitations by the committee to enable the school state its own side of the matter.” \nOne of the petitioners, Mr Solomon Tedjere, said that the University victimised him and unjustly withheld his bachelors degree result five years after graduation based on an alleged publication inciting students without a name or signature. \nThe petitioner said he successfully completed his studies in the Department of Vocational Education Agricultural Science unit in 2012 but at the point of collecting his statement of result, he was informed that he had been expelled since 2011 from the University on an alleged account of the anonymous publication.
