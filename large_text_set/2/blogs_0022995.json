It’s only the beginning of Belle’s journey, and she’s already debuted one of our favorite looks to date: This long, flowing off-the-shoulder dress with a hella impressive train .\nIf you’ve ever worn a dress with a train before, you know that while you’ll look , you will also probably struggle a little walking and moving. You can easily (and accidentally) get wrapped up in them and topple over. Also, if you’re taking pictures, the train itself needs to look , because trains are hard work, too.\nEmma’s latest look includes a train to end all trains, but that also means that someone else has to be on hand to help the IRL Disney princess down the red carpet (or in this case, blue carpet and also grass).\nFirst, let’s just marvel at the dress in all its glory, because it is damn impressive: John Phillips/Getty Images Mike Marsland/Contributor/Getty Images Impressive, right? Also, A LOT OF HARD WORK. So may we present, the coolest job on the planet right now: The woman assigned to manage Emma’s train for her like PRO. Dave J Hogan/Getty Images, HelloGiggles Joe Maher/Contributor/Getty Images Dave J Hogan/Contributor/Getty Images Even Emma’s Beauty and the Beast co-star, Dan Stevens, is like “wow, how do I snag this job?” Joe Maher/Contributor/Getty Images Don’t be too jealous that you don’t have a designated Train Lady, Dan. Maybe one day. When you’re older. Joe Maher/Contributor/Getty Images Train work is never done. Dave J Hogan/Contributor/Getty Images Dave J Hogan/Contributor/Getty Images We reached out to Disney for the identity of this Train Lady, because we want to talk to her and also be her best friend. Joe Maher/Contributor/Getty Images Joe Maher/Getty Images Let’s hope that Emma and her Train Entourage continue to travel around the world together for the rest of the Beauty and the Beast press tour, because we’re going to need a lot more trains, and a lot more of this dynamic trio (Emma + Train + Trusted Train Lady).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:53:26.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
