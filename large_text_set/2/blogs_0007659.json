He said the students were “making fun of him,” according to the Daily Titan. \n“I lost it and I started screaming and they grabbed me from behind and my stuff went flying everywhere,” he said. \nNo injuries were reported, but the CSUF College Republicans club were working with the school and campus police to press charges, Breitbart reported. A man claiming to be a professor has assaulted one of our protesters. We are in contact with the police. \n— CSUF Republicans (@CSUFGOP) February 8, 2017 \nA university spokesman condemned what he called this “violent incident” on campus. #CSUF prizes and promotes free and open expression. Any violent incident, however isolated, cannot be tolerated and is unacceptable. \n— Jeffrey D. Cook (@ccoCSUF) February 8, 2017 \nMembers of the College Republicans told Breitbart the school was downplaying the incident.
