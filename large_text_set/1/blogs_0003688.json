He admitted that — despite facing the death penalty — he is representing himself because he didn’t want a lawyer to try to save him by using his mental health as a defense. \n“There is nothing wrong with me psychologically,” he assured a South Carolina courtroom Wednesday. \nRoof, now 22, was convicted last month of murdering nine black churchgoers during a Bible study in Charleston nearly two years ago. \nDespite protestations from his court-appointed lawyers, Roof is representing himself as his sentencing gets underway. \nAs he spoke to jurors briefly Wednesday morning, the avowed white supremacist didn’t address his actions, he didn’t comment on the prosecution’s opening statement and he didn’t apologize; he only promised to tell them the truth. \nFederal prosecutors showed the jury Wednesday portions of a journal Roof allegedly kept while he’s been in jail. That journal is filled with racist thoughts and notably lacks any sign of remorse. \n“I would like to make it crystal clear. I do not regret what I did. I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed,” Roof wrote in the journal, according to the Charleston Post and Courier . \"I do not regret what I did. I am not sorry.
