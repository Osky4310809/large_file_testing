It is one of the most iconic Zombies features in the game, due to the fact that it appears in every Zombies map and is the first wonder weapon created by the illustrious Group 935 . It also has many different effects and animations depending on the map being played. A direct successor to the Ray Gun, known as the Ray Gun Mark II , appears in every Zombies map of Call of Duty: Black Ops II if the player purchases the Vengeance downloadable content. Another successor to the Ray Gun is the Ray Gun Mark III, seen in the right hand of the GKZ-45 Mk3 on the Black Ops III Zombies map Gorod Krovi . Contents Call of Duty: World at War Zombies \nThe Ray Gun is available in all Zombies maps in Call of Duty: World at War available only in the Mystery Box . The Ray Gun is often the most favored weapon in Zombies due to its ability to kill in one shot until rounds 18 to 22, or 22 to 25 when Pack-a-Punched, and its large ammo capacity for such a high-damage weapon. As well, the Ray Gun can hit multiple zombies at once, courtesy of its splash damage. However, the same splash damage can be dealt to the user themselves, and can potentially down them in unfavorable locations. It is pinpoint accurate, and the bullets have a travel time, meaning that the player should aim their shots very carefully, especially since it takes a small, but noticeable amount of time for the shot to reach its target. The Ray Gun can hold 20 rounds (40 when Pack-a-Punched) inside its magazine. However, after said rounds, the Ray Gun will steep off immensely in terms of usefulness, commonly creating crawlers. The Ray Gun shoots slowly, and as such, can benefit from using Double Tap Root Beer in order to increase its effectiveness; however, it can cause inaccurate players to burn through ammunition supplies at alarming rates. The reload animation for the Ray Gun ends when a distinct, distorted sound is heard, after the barrel of the Ray Gun is closed. As such, players should be aware of its Reload Cancel time, as attempting to reload cancel as soon as the battery enters the barrel will yield danger to the user. To alleviate this, Speed Cola can be useful in order to perform its 3 second reload faster. Achievement/Trophy / Silver Trophy ) - Obtain the Ray Gun, Wunderwaffe DG-2 and the Monkey Bomb at the same time in one game of Der Riese Campaign \nThe single player mission \" Little Resistance \" also features the Ray Gun as an Easter egg. After using the first artillery strike, head onto the beach. Next, on the far right there is a puddle. Get into the puddle and then move on to the next puddle in the general middle of the shore. Then, just stay in the far left puddle about 10 seconds. After that, the ground will shake and then the player should hear a japanese-like voice. Four Shisa statues will arise from the ground holding a Ray Gun. To get it, walk up to any of the four statues and then press and hold the action button. The gun starts with maximum ammunition, and the player can come back to the statues and get a new Ray Gun an unlimited amount of times. \nThe player can get the Ray Gun as a tertiary weapon by holding the radio to get it. By doing so, the player will lose the ability to call the rocket strike. To prevent this, call a rocket strike then immediately get the Ray Gun from the statues before the radio hand-off. After that, the player should have three guns and have the radio back after the count. This trick can be done again if players wishes to acquire different guns by replacing the Ray Gun with other guns they do not have. \nThe Ray Gun can be used to destroy enemy tanks with two shots at the end of \" Little Resistance \" instead of calling an artillery strike. It also has the ability to distort dead bodies.

While still being very powerful (one-shot-kill up to round 15-16), the gun has a tendency to start making crawlers on rounds 18 and higher more often if shot at the legs. Although this can be very useful, the player may be caught unaware by them and blocked/surrounded. At about round 23, the Porter's X2 Ray Gun (the upgraded version of the Ray Gun) will start to make crawlers. Occasionally, when the player aims down the sight, the reticle can change colors from red, green, purple, white, yellow, and blue. One problem is that it makes a mere 50 points per kill, making it one of the worst weapons to accumulate points with, especially in early rounds. The Ray Gun, along with the other wonder weapons , is very useful on Kino der Toten , \"Five\" , and Moon , as Gas Zombies will not release their toxic gas if killed with it. In most rounds past round 30, the Ray Gun and Porter's X2 Ray Gun will be near useless against the zombies, taking multiple shots to kill them, and as such, should be traded out for a better weapon. Also, the splash damage can be lethal to the player if fired at a zombie or an object close to them, unless they have PhD Flopper . In the case where PhD Flopper is active, there is zero detriment to shooting zombies at extremely close quarters, and can even make the Ray Gun a life saver in the case of being surrounded. \nA document from Dr. Vannevar Bush reveals more about the Ray Gun. The document reveals that the Ray Gun was developed by Dr. Ludvig Maxis of Group 935 and was based on designs seized from the Rising Sun Facility in Japan. It is powered by a combination of Element 115 and Cold Fusion Technology, creating \"Cold Cell Batteries\" to be inserted into the gun as ammunition. \nThe animations and cocking of the weapon are the same as the ones from Call of Duty: World at War . When diving to prone, the gun will aim straight as if the player was aiming down the sights, with the exception that it is at the bottom of the screen. \nOn the map Ascension, this gun can be used to destroy the rocket, granting an achievement/trophy and a Double Points in the room where the rocket was (this room opens after the rocket is destroyed).

It causes no splash damage to the user and loses its one-shot-kill ability earlier (compared to Call of Duty: World at War ), at round 17 for Verrückt and Nacht der Untoten , and round 20 for Der Riese and Shi No Numa . Along with these differences, it is not fully automatic on the iOS version. Obtaining it on the iOS version gives the player the \"Space Man\" achievement, and using it to kill 100 zombies gives the player the \"Laser Face\" achievement. It also causes no aesthetic damage to zombies, and cannot make crawlers. \nThe cancel time for reloading has been extended to the time when the player closes the battery outlet.
