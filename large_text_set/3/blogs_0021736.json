Photo: Hyken Wong/ Twitter \nTim Cook has repeatedly dissed Microsoft’s Surface tablets by comparing them to a toaster-refrigerator , but during his trip to China this week the Apple CEO was forced to spend some up-close time with the convertible tablet. \nAs one of the 300 attendees at this year’s China Development Forum, Cook was given a free Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet to use during the conference. Microsoft sponsored the event and g ave out the tablets so attendees can follow slideshows, take notes in Microsoft Office and ask questions electronically. \nBased on some of the conference photos floating around online , most of the people at the conference tossed their Surface Pro 4 aside or used another computer. \nTim probably just pulled a CNN and used the Surface Pro as an iPad kickstand . \nAlong with giving out free Surface Pros, Microsoft also had demos of it HoloLens augmented reality headset. The device could compete directly with Apple in the future if rumors come true that Apple plans to add AR features to the iPhone and future glasses. Cook made a speech at the event during the weekend. His speech focused on the benefits of globalization. Despite President’s Trumps claims that globalization is hurting America, Cook says that shutting the country off from the globe would be a bad move.\n“I think the worst thing would be to — because it didn’t help everyone — is to say it’s bad and do less of that,” said Cook. “I think the reality is you can see that countries in the world… that isolate themselves, it’s not good for their people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:44:14.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
