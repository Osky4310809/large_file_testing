She was spotted in a bright red knee-length coat, which she paired with a pair of dark tan boots having a maroon hue to it. She accessorised   sling and with a contrasting scarf around her neck. We can say she was dressed in almost shades of red from head-toe hence we said we loved her ‘lady in red’ look. With her hair blow-dried to perfection, she looked absolutely stunning. \nAre you guys loving one tone look as much as we are?
