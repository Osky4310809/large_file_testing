Keep your eyes on the kid in the glasses holding the bible at the swearing-in ceremony for Kansas Representative Roger Marshall. That’s Rep. Marshall’s son who sidetracks the entire thing by hitting the dab for the TV cameras during the swearing in with House Speaker Paul Ryan.\nPaul Ryan isn’t amused by the antics at all and hates all the fun this kid is having. No, Mr. Speaker, that is not a sneeze.\nPersonally I think the kid deserves some huge high fives for seizing a perfect dab-able moment. The reactions Mr. No Fun has inspired are so spot on:\nPaul Ryan is your friend's dad who yells at you to turn down the music at 8pm on a Saturday\n— Colin Jones (@colinjones) January 3, 2017 \nPaul Ryan is your friend's dad who won't order pizza for the party\n— Colin Jones (@colinjones) January 3, 2017 \nPaul Ryan would be really into Nickleback\n— Colin Jones (@colinjones) January 3, 2017 \n@colinjones Paul Ryan is your neighbor who invites himself to your BBQ and coincidentally, it starts raining.\n— marleyfurr (@marleyfurr) January 3, 2017 \n@colinjones Paul Ryan doesn't understand that a little dab'll do ya.\n— Saber Khai (@bbbourb) January 3, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:40:08.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
