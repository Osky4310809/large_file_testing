More by Nick Vadala Arrow icon \nSo that’s what the Ellen DeGeneres Show was doing in Philly. \nAbout 500 Ellen DeGeneres fans descended upon Center City on Wednesday after the talk show host tweeted for supporters to show up at 17th and Walnut in costume as a famous duo. The host, meanwhile, joined her fans via satellite for a segment that aired on the show Thursday. \nNobody shows up like Philly. Lots of love in Philadelphia today! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/8baz0AdFwU \n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) March 23, 2017 \nEllen correspondent Jeannie Klisiewicz and Philadelphia Eagle/magician Jon Dorenbos were on hand to pick two pairs from the crowd to compete on an obstacle course for a grand prize of $10,000. Klisiewicz and Dorenbos went with one couple dressed as a narwal and a shark, and a second couple dressed as the punny “black-eyed p’s.” \nVictoria Sacchatti and Katrina Arman (the shark/narwal couple) won the $10,000 grand prize, with Hannah Donovan and Devan Allen (the “p’s”) taking home a $5,000 runner-up prize. \nAs the Inquirer 's Tirdad Derakhshani reports, some crowd members showed up to the event as early as 10 a.m., despite DeGeneres asking fans to show up at 4 p.m. Taping for the show began at 6 p.m., with the crowd thinning to “just over 300” by the time filming began, the Inquirer reports. \nAside from sea creatures and pun-based costumes, the crowd also brought out folks dressed as everything from Wonder Woman and Batman to Mario and Luigi. Our pick, however, goes to Haddonfield’s Dan Riley and his fiancée, Grace McAleer. \nThe pair went to the event dressed in eight-foot-tall stilts and masks designed to make them look old. Which, given Riley’s explanation, sort of makes sense. \n“We’re just very tall people,” Riley said Wednesday. “We are very old because we’ve been waiting so long for Ellen.” Read more by Nick Vadala More Coverage March 24, 2017 — 9:48 AM EDT | Updated: March 24, 2017 — 9:54  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:17:45.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
