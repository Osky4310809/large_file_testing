When he, Thea, Quentin, and Dinah get inside, Thea says she's trying to find out how it leaked. Oliver replies that it was Prometheus. In fact, he says that if he loses his office, Prometheus wins. Oliver quickly decides to tell the media the truth, or at least a version of the truth. He also asks Thea to make things right with Susan Williams. Chase walks in and hands Oliver a letter of resignation, as he plans on taking the fall for the cover-up. Oliver refuses to take it, but Chase warns him that an impeachment could follow soon. \nChase explains how the impeachment would work: city council takes a vote and majority rules. Chase says that his resigning would be an easier solution, but Oliver instead asks Chase to represent him at the impeachment hearing as his attorney. \nIn a flashback, Oliver and Anatoli are cornered, but Anatoli invokes a Bratva rule to keep them alive. Oliver doesn't understand what's going on, but Anatoli says he just saved their lives...for a couple of hours. \nCurtis explains his new T-Spheres to Rene in the Arrow Cave while Oliver asks Felicity for help with Susan, as she helped get Susan fired. Felicity also tells Oliver that she thinks Oliver will beat the impeachment hearing. \nMeanwhile, Vigilante suits up and sets his sights on Oliver Queen. \nOliver walks into the impeachment hearing and sees Susan, who's now starting her own blog. The hearing (which is televised) begins. Felicity and the team watch back at the Arrow Cave. While Oliver takes a call from his estranged father, Felicity shows Pandora to Diggle. Diggle warns that it could be used as a weapon if used improperly. \nAt the impeachment hearing, the coroner testifies that Chase asked him to cover up the death. Captain Pike of the ACU also testifies about Queen's conversation with him last episode. \nAs they leave the hearing, Chase says he'll try to convince a council member to call on Queen to testify. When they get in Oliver's limo, Thea suggests they claim Malone was corrupt, but Oliver shuts her down. Vigilante attacks the limo, causing it to crash, but when he goes after Oliver, Dinah and Thea slow him down. Vigilante eventually takes aim at Oliver, but he hears the police and flees. \nIn the aftermath, Oliver has a concussion, but everyone else is somewhat okay. Chase shows up and convinces him to go into a hospital, while Thea heads back to the Arrowcave to lead in the team in the hunt for Vigilante. She also asks Felicity to use Pandora to dig up dirt on the councilperson thought to be the swing vote. \nOliver talks to Dr. Schwartz, who seems to know his identity as Green Arrow. She says he can't leave the hospital for a few more hours and recommends he talks to someone about all the evil he faces on a daily basis. \nAnatoli explains that he called for a Bratva tribunal of sorts, although if Anatoli loses he dies. Oliver says they need to find evidence that Kovar's deal with Gregor only benefits Gregor, so he leaves to find said evidence. \nDinah finds a part of Vigilante's visor at the crime scene. She calls it in to Felicity and Curtis says he can use his T-Spheres to track it. Curtis also mentions to Rene that Paul asked him to dinner. \nChase shows up at the crime scene and takes the piece of Vigilante's visor from Dinah. A bit later, Prometheus attacks Vigilante and throws him off a rooftop. When it's over, Prometheus removes his mask and calls the police....revealing that he's ACTUALLY CHASE. \nBack at the Arrow Cave, Felicity tells Diggle about the dirt she found on the councilperson. Diggle says that Felicity is losing her empathy, probably because of Billy Malone's death. Diggle warns her that fighting fire with fire will get her burned. \nChase talks to Pike about Star City's vigilante issue, while Dinah swipes Vigilante's visor piece from the station. \nOliver confronts Thea about the blackmail, but Thea says it's just politics. Oliver warns her, but Thea seems set on playing dirty to keep Oliver in office. \nIn a flashback, Oliver breaks into Kovar's home and finds files on Kovar's computer. \nCurtis uses his T-Spheres to track successfully track Vigilante. Diggle and the rest of the team roll out to find Vigilante and take him down once and for all. \nChase walks into Oliver's office and says he can't get the city council to call Oliver to testify. Chase says they need a sacrificial lamb, so Oliver says to arrange a press conference so they can blame....THE GREEN ARROW. \nCurtis tracks Vigilante to a building right across the street from City Hall, where Oliver is about to give his press conference. They realize that Vigilante is planning to assassinate him. They call and warn Dinah, but Oliver goes ahead with the press conference anyways. As Oliver begins his press conference, Diggle, Wild Dog, and Mr. Terrific try to stop Vigilante. Vigilante gets the drop on him, but Mr. Terrific blows up one of his T-Spheres. \nOliver explains to the press that he covered up Malone's murder to prevent the city from finding out that Green Arrow was a cop-killer, since the city had lost so many heroes already. Meanwhile, Vigilante shoots both Diggle and Wild Dog, but Mr. Terrific detonates his second T-Sphere to take out Vigilante out. They walk outside just in time to hear Oliver call for the police to find and arrest Green Arrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:13:03.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
