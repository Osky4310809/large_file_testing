He is incredibly smart and wants nothing more than for Koreans to have independence. He is protective of his little cousin Dong Ju and encourages him to continue writing his poems. Judging from these two characters, you can tell that they both have a deep appreciation for education and literature, but because of the given circumstances, they are unable to focus on these passions. Instead, Mong Gyu attempts to make some radical change while he is studying in Japan. Although he does not have an army of people to help him create an effective revolution, he stands by his ideals and tries his best to create change. \nPark Jung Min just continues to impress me with his performances. When you take a look at his most recent role as Lee Ho Jin in “Entourage” and compare it with his portrayal of Song Mong Gyu, you can see how completely different the characters are. It’s only through some impressive acting ability that you’re able to showcase such stark characters, and Park Jung Min hits the nail on the head. It’s evident that Park Jung Min really believes in his character and the story of the movie. You can see it in the way he acts and the way he delivers specific lines in the movie. It’s a performance that can not be missed. 5. It teaches us the value and power of the arts “Poetry is also good enough to express your ideas. When it uncovers the truth living in people’s hearts, literature gains power and that power gathered together can change the world.” -Yun Dong Ju \nThere is a part in the movie where Dong Ju tells his father about his and his cousin’s plan to start a magazine. Dong Ju would write poems and his cousin would write essays. His father’s response is something us arts and humanities students have heard all too often, “As a writer, at best, you’d just become a newspaper reporter.” His father completely objects Dong Ju’s willingness to go to school to be a writer. \nThe best part about this movie is that Dong Ju is able to do so much more than become a newspaper reporter. He’s able to touch the lives and hearts of many people, even now. Dong Ju’s beautiful poetry not only touches the hearts of many, it will continue to be a reminder of the people who struggled during this time in history. 6. Finally, Kang Ha Neul’s beautiful singing on the OST \nHearing Kang Ha Neul’s singing as the credits were rolling at the end of the movie was just the icing on top of the cake. It brought the entire movie together and it’ll leave an unforgettable impression on you. You might cry. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. \nI encourage everyone to watch this movie and to take in the history and brilliant performances from all the actors. Hope you enjoy! \nCheck out the trailer below, and click here to watch “Dongju: The Portrait of a Poet.” \nbinahearts is a Soompi writer who can be most often seen singing her heart out at karaoke, walking her dog, or indulging in dessert.
