It’s a pretty sweet phone.\nIts cool rounded display and premium finish make this a big step up over the G5. Now that the buzz has died down a day later, there are a few questions about the G6 that are floating around. Does it have a home button? What’s up with the 18:9 ratio aspect? How big is the battery?\nWe have answers to all those questions. Down below is a quick breakdown of the features mentioned, but Jon goes into more detail in the video above.\nThe G6’s home button is on the back of the phone and doubles as a fingerprint scanner and a physical button you can press. The 18:9 ratio is not called 2:1 ratio because people are still comfortable with the 16:9 numeric breakdown. The G6 comes with a 3,300mAh battery The G6 comes with three types of Gorilla Glass: the front panel is Gorilla Glass 3, the panel over the camera is Gorilla Glass 4 and the panel on the back of the device is Gorilla Glass 5. The high quality DAC present in the V20 is not in the G6. The G6 fixes the bootloop issue other LG phones have suffered from.
