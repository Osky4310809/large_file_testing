Components include trade, foreign direct and portfolio investments, and even remittances from Filipinos abroad. \nA deficit means more money went out of the country while a surplus means otherwise.   \nBSP Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo expects an improvement in the country’s external payments position as the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the second time in three months has reduced uncertainties. \nThe US Fed assured last week that further rate increases this year would be gradual. \n“One hike this year and Fed officials sounded a little bit dovish and at the same time there will be two or three hikes. I think it also cleared the air of any uncertainty,” Guinigundo said. \nFor this year, the BSP expects a BOP surplus of $1 billion as foreign direct investments inflow is seen hitting $7 billion while the outflow of foreign portfolio investments or hot money is seen declining to $900 million. \nEconomic managers penned a GDP growth of between 6.5 and 7.5 percent this year amid robust private consumption and investments growth. \nThe economy accelerated by 6.8 percent last year from 5.9 percent in 2015.
