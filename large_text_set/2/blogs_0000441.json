According to Italian newspaper Tuttosport , Kolašinac will be heading to Turin next week to undergo a medical and sign off on a free transfer to Juventus at the end of the season. The Old Lady let former Manchester United left back Patrice Evra join Olympique Marseille on a free transfer in January, as the veteran had lost his place in Massimiliano Allegri's starting eleven to Alex Sandro. Now with only Paolo de Ceglie left to provide cover for their main left wing-back, Juve have set their sights to Kolašinac. Chelsea looked to have stolen the march on Juve last week by offering €6m for an immediate transfer, but Schalke changed their mind at the last minute and decided to keep the 23-year-old. None of that changes the fact that Kolašinac's contract with Schalke ends in June, and he’s thus free to make arrangements for his next career move. That move appears set to be Juventus.
