Egerton House Hotel \nThe new menu features a choice of fine leaf teas, plus homemade vegan cakes including an iced chocolate brownie, vanilla and coconut sponge, lemon drizzle cake, a fruit and custard tartlet and a vanilla cupcake. \nThe menu’s freshly cut sandwiches feature vegan fillings such as grilled vegetables, guacamole and rocket, chickpea-coronation, cucumber and margarine and tomato and olive tapenade on sun-dried tomato bread. \nAnd of course, afternoon tea wouldn’t be complete without freshly home-baked scones. Both plain and fruit vegan scones are available and served with a selection of preserves. \nThe spread will set you back £40 per person, but for the peace of mind of knowing all courses are 100% free from animal products, we’d say it’s worth it. \nThe hotel also offers traditional afternoon tea, vegetarian afternoon tea and gluten-free afternoon tea, meaning there’s plenty of options to satisfy your non-vegan pals.
