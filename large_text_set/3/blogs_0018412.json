So I can’t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I’m for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies,\" Lahren told members of The View , changing her strict conservative tune on air.\n\"I can sit here and say that as a Republican, and I can say, you know what, I’m for limited government, so stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well.\"\nGreat time on @TheView pic.twitter.com/atdhwK0oBl\n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 17, 2017\nFollowing the liberal-leaning comments, Leon Wolf, managing editor of Glenn Beck's conservative media outlet, TheBlaze, simply told CNN, \"Tomi's show will not be in production this week.\" Though Lahren did not officially address the suspension, she composed several tweets that appeared to respond to the controversy, explaining she will always \"speak her truth\" and will \"never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker.\"\nI speak my truth. If you don't like it, tough. I will always be honest and stand in my truth.\n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017\nI have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker.\n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017\nListen, I am not glorifying abortion. I don't personally advocate for it. I just don't think it's the government's place to dictate. https://t.co/qRjbAtJdo7\n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 19, 2017\nThough no official reasoning was given for Lahren's week-long on-air absence, conservative fans and those who have been keeping up with the 24-year-old's political rants were clearly taken aback by her hypocritical change in viewpoint.\nwait. tomi lahren said she was pro choice and conservatives are turning against her?? i love this episode of gossip girl\n— bri (@rxinyweather) March 18, 2017\n\"my truth\" is the new \"alternative facts\" https://t.co/aIEsetdeKt\n— Gabby Morrongiello (@gabriellahope_) March 19, 2017\nLife comes at you fast. pic.twitter.com/AP09UPGtPy\n— Danielle Butcher (@DaniSButcher) March 17, 2017\nTomi Lahren: interracial marriage is genocide\nNew GOP: omg you're so right\nTomi Lahren: i'm pro-choice\nNew GOP: BURN THE WITCH\n— Emanuel Zbeda (@therealezway) March 20, 2017\nTo the criticism and swift judgement from conservatives, Lahren simply explained conservatives don't always have to agree on everything.\nThank you. Conservatives don't have to exist in a monolith and share the same brain on every issue. It's okay. https://t.co/YqzJNcaRar\n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 19, 2017\nMembers of The View later came to Lahren's defense in a follow-up panel chat with a similar mindset, explaining that people don't have to fall in line with every stance of their political affiliation. However, TheBlaze founder, Glen Beck was not too pleased.\nOn Monday, Beck Quote: d Lahren's tweet in which she claimed she has libertarian views, adding that Trump is \"anything but libertarian.\" He later addressed the 24-year-old's \"dustup\" on The Glenn Beck Radio Program .\nWait, libertarian views? Help me out on Trumpcare, stimulus, and executive orders. Trump is anything but libertarian. #intellectualhonesty https://t.co/jlt5sFvQMP\n— Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) March 20, 2017\nFirst of all, we have a whole bunch of different kinds of people that work here,\" Beck announced, explaining that if you're pro-choice you can still have a job at TheBlaze. However, he said, \"I don’t hire people who are sycophants or don’t have my opinion. I try to hire people who have a different opinion because I believe in being intellectually rigorous.\"\n\"I don’t want strawmen. I want people to have a real argument on the other side so we can learn from each other, and we can grow.\"\nBeck did not address Lahren's future with the company, so we'll just have to wait and see.\nWATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/glennbeck/status/843677593719242752", "https://twitter.com/DaniSButcher/status/842819998246719489", "https://t.co/aIEsetdeKt", "https://twitter.com/TomiLahren/status/843254701512712192", "http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/20/media/tomi-lahren-glenn-beck-the-blaze/", "https://t.co/AP09UPGtPy", "https://twitter.com/TomiLahren/status/843115966477164544", "https://t.co/YqzJNcaRar", "https://t.co/jlt5sFvQMP", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/rgQB8NjD.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/rgQB8NjD.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/intellectualhonesty?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/TomiLahren/status/843167028869582850", "https://twitter.com/gabriellahope_/status/843510730339106816", "http://www.glennbeck.com/2017/03/20/glenn-addresses-tomi-lahrens-pro-choice-stance-on-the-view/?platform=hootsuite", "https://t.co/atdhwK0oBl", "https://t.co/qRjbAtJdo7", "https://twitter.com/TomiLahren/status/842775863380918272", "https://twitter.com/therealezway/status/843948232879345666", "https://twitter.com/rxinyweather/status/843197073428115456", "https://twitter.com/TomiLahren/status/843253708372824065", "https://twitter.com/TheView"], "published": "2017-03-21T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:13:48.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
