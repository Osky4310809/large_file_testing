She looked just gorgeous at the Golden Globes Awards 2017 in a golden Ralph Lauren gown. Not only did she get the outfit right but she also got her makeup just perfect. If you had watched the show, you would have also noticed Modern Family star Sofia Vergara sizzling in a similar golden dress. The two hot women set the red carpet on fire and had everyone hooked to social media. In fact, Priyanka and Sofia even posted a few boomerangs and selfies with each other online. While Priyanka Chopra continues to rock the red carpet style, there were some actresses who failed to impress us. \nFelicity Jones, Sophie Turner, Nicole Kidman, Zoe Saldana and Thandie Newton joined the Worst Dressed list at the awards this year. Felicity Jones wore a Gucci silk tulle gown with a crystal bow on it. It just wasn’t red carpet worthy if you ask us. Sophie Turner’s Louis Vuitton was a bit of a misfit , too. The belt, shoulder pads and the thigh-high slit didn’t really go well together. Liz Hernandez wore a Massachi which she should have ignored at all costs while Zoe Saldana chose a Gucci outfit with tons of frills on it. We weren’t really impressed with the outfits that these fashionably correct women picked for the red carpet this time. Thandie Newton, who was nominated for Westworld, wore a Monse white gown with orange sequins at the end.

Priyanka Chopra also presented an award at the event along with setting the red carpet on fire. And for you PeeCee fans out there, she did the twirl again this time and oh so perfectly! Check out these pictures of actresses that Priyanka Chopra beat at the Golden Globes 2017. Do you agree with us or not?
