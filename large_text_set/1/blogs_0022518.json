You may remember him from his press conference on Saturday complaining about the media coverage on crowd numbers at the inauguration.\nSEE ALSO: That didn't take long: Trump's press secretary is already a meme\nBut as some internet sleuths have discovered, Spicer has a long-held vendetta against Dippin' Dots — those little balls of ice-cream that accompany trips to malls or at a theme park — as per his Twitter account.\n\"Dippin dots is NOT the ice cream of the future,\" Spicer wrote back in 2010.\nDippin dots is NOT the ice cream of the future\n— Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) April 8, 2010\nThen again in September 2011: \"I think I have said this before but Dippin Dots are notthe (sic) ice cream the future,\" he wrote.\nI think I have said this before but Dippin Dots are notthe ice cream of the future\n— Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 22, 2011\nHe even reveled in news of the ice-cream maker's bankruptcy filing in 2011.

And why does it appear that he still continues to purchase them? The ice cream of the future depends on it.\n[h/t The AV Club ]\nBONUS: Trump's 2017 vs Obama's 2009: A brutal inaugural concert comparison", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/11794196641", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/ABnQtUA7.jpg", "http://www.avclub.com/article/trumps-new-press-secretary-five-year-running-feud--248859", "https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/116970977878999040", "https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/640955839390576640", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/ABnQtUA7.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/132499281847402496", "https://twitter.com/Nationals", "http://t.co/xPifdujD"], "published": "2017-01-23T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T03:16:32.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
