The Olympian has recently formed a business partnership with the company. \"I really can't say it enough. I don't think people really pay enough attention to how important sleep is.\" -Michael Phelps, Olympic swimmer \nSleep is \"where you can naturally grow and your body recovers,\" says Phelps. \nWhen Phelps was training for the Olympics, he swam seven days a week, covering between 70,000 and 100,000 yards a week. show chapters Wednesday, 8 Feb 2017 | 1:49 PM ET | 05:32 \nAs part of his workout regimen, Phelps tracked not only how much sleep he got but how deeply he slept. He made note of the quantity and quality of his sleep and data points such as whether he was getting REM sleep, deep sleep or light sleep. \n\"I really can't say it enough. I don't think people really pay enough attention to how important sleep is,\" says Phelps. \nHe was in the pool three to five hours a day seven days a week. To maintain that workout schedule, Phelps slept eight hours a night and took a 2-3 hour nap each afternoon, he says. \nNow, though he's retired from swimming, Phelps still tries to get at least eight hours of shut eye a night. But, since he has a nine-month-old baby, that's a challenge worthy of an Olympian. show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:49:11.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
