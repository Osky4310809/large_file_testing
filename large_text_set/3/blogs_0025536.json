Star David Boreanaz won’t be jobless for long. According to Deadline , he’s already been cast in a new pilot. Boreanaz is replacing Jim Caviezel ( The Passion of The Christ , The Thin Red Line ) in the lead role in an upcoming CBS Navy SEAL pilot. Caviezel starred in the long-running CBS crime drama series Person of Interest . Caviezel reportedly left the pilot over creative differences with the pilot’s producer CBS TV Studios. \nBoreanaz will also serve as producer for the Navy SEAL pilot, alongside Sarah Timberman, Carl Beverly and Chris Chulack, who will executive produce for CBS TV Studios. The pilot was written by Ben Cavell and will be directed by Chulack. It “follows the lives of the elite Navy SEALs as they train, plan and execute the most dangerous, high-stakes missions our country can ask.” Boreanaz will play Jason, “the respected, committed leader of his assault team who’s been through over a dozen deployments, with scars inside and out.” The cast for the Navy SEAL pilot includes Max Theriot ( Bates Motel ), Neil Brown Jr. ( Straight Outta Compton ), A.J. Buckley ( The Good Dinosaur ), Toni Trucks ( The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 ) and Jessica Pare ( Mad Men ). \nIn addition to the long-running series Bones , Boreanaz is known for his work as the vampire Angel on the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer , then moving to his own series Angel , which ran for five seasons. How are you guys feeling about the end of Bones ? Is there anything you want to see in the final episode? Will it be strange to see David Boreanaz in a new role after 12 seasons? Are you excited for the new show?   !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:20:20.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
