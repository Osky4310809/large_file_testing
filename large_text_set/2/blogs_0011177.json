Disappearing: Snowy scenes in the French Alps \nThe findings come after a poor start to the 2016/17 ski season, with many Alpine resorts struggling with little snow in December. \nRecent flurries have meant conditions have improved but scientists at the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos, Switzerland, warn that the bad start to the season could become a far more frequent pattern in future. \nSebastian Schlögl, one of the authors of the study and a researcher at the Institute, said: “Since many Alpine villages are heavily dependent on winter tourism, the economy and society of regions with such tourism centres will suffer.” \nThe study, published in the European Geoscience Union journal The Cryosphere, used computer models to examine what would happen to snowfall in the mountains as global temperatures rise. Climate change: Skiing in the Alps may be impossible in 80 years \nUnder current climate change predictions the world is set to warm by more than 2C unless action is taken to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \nAs temperatures rise, winter rainfall across mountainous regions of Europe is expected to rise. There has been uncertainty, however, over how rising temperatures would impact snowfall. \nThe new research suggests even if global warming is restricted to 2C, snow cover will fall by 30 per cent by 2100. The Alpine winter season will also start between half a month to a month later than at present. \nIncreased rainfall could also mean more ice in those slopes that do get snow.
