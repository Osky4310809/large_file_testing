Titled “Abra Kadabra,” the March 28 episode is described as follows: \n“Desperate to save Iris (Candice Patton), Barry considers taking the deal but Gypsy (guest star Jessica Camacho) breaches in to capture the villain for her own reasons and during the melee, Abra Kadabra manages to escape. Barry is furious that Gypsy interfered but Gypsy refuses to back down, forcing Cisco (Carlos Valdes) to take sides. Meanwhile, Julian (Tom Felton) is still a bit cold towards Caitlin (Danielle Panabaker) but when she is severely injured in a battle with Gypsy, he rushes to her side.” \nNina Lopez-Corrado directed the episode, featuring a story by Andrew Kreisberg and teleplay by Brooke Roberts & David Kob. \nFollowing that, the next episode of DC’s Legends of Tomorrow is set to air on Tuesday. Titled “Doomworld,” it’s described as follows: \n“After obtaining the Spear of Destiny, the Legion of Doom rewrites reality, leaving the Legends changed, perhaps forever. Frightfully, the Legends’ and the world’s hopes rest with Rory (Dominic Purcell), but being the “hero” is not easy for him. Meanwhile, there is tension within the Legion of Doom and the reason why the Spear of Destiny needs to be destroyed is revealed.” \nMairzee Almas directed the episode, written by Ray Utarnachitt & Sarah Hernandez. \nDC’s Legends of Tomorrow stars Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter, Brandon Routh as Ray Palmer/The ATOM, Caity Lotz as Sara Lance/White Canary, Victor Garber and Franz Drameh as Professor Martin Stein & Jefferson “Jax” Jackson/Firestorm, Dominic Purcell as Mick Rory/Heat Wave, and Nick Zano as Dr. Nate Heywood/Steel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:27:16.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
