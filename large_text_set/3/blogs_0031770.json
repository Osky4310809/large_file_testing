I went to the nearby Kirori Mal College. But Ramjas is integral to the long years i spent at Delhi University.\nIt is at Ramjas that i learnt how students with contending views from different colleges could attend Dilip Simeon’s legendary history classes and participate in acrimonious debates. Apart from other things, Simeon also taught me not to condemn someone as anti-national just because the mighty state has filed an FIR against the person.\nIf we were to extend this logic politicians across the spectrum, especially the leading lights of BJP should have shunned the public sphere long ago on alleged charges no less serious than being an anti-national. There is a conspiracy of silence from voluble BJP spokespersons and relative lack of outrage in the media.\nAgain it was near the Ramjas gate that Delhi University witnessed a battle of competing ideologies during the heady days of agitation against OBC reservation in 1990, at times violent but less so than the violence ABVP perpetrated on its opponents on 21 and 22 February. There were less pro-reservation marches but they did take place. ABVP and NSUI were all on the same side against the VP Singh government’s historic decision. After months of disturbance and disruption, the university was back on its feet and so were students, their friendship intact regardless of the Mandal divide.\nTo argue that the English department of Ramjas College erred in inviting JNU student Umar Khalid, facing nothing but an FIR, and allege it was to whip up a controversy is trivialising the issue. It echoes BJP leaders who without any proof see Umar, Kanhaiya Kumar and Gurmehar Kaur as threats to the unity and integrity of our supposedly ‘fragile’ republic.\nMore than a year after the JNU disturbances, the votaries of ‘nationalism’ have not moved an inch beyond easy branding of all who disagree and dissent as ‘anti-nationals’. For them all non-compliant voices are a stumbling block to the making of a paradise called Bharatvarsha. Well, these are basic ingredients of a totalitarian state that have been used both by the communists and rightist regimes in equal measure in history.\nTherefore the likes of Umar, we are told now, should be kept out of campuses and even before any court convicts him, be condemned as anti-national and unfit to address students. Listening to Umar or his exceptionally brilliant JNU colleague Shehla Rashid or even the right wing’s duller Sadhvi Prachi does not mean one has to agree with them, just like members of the Upper House of Parliament heard Annadurai with rapt attention as he sought self-determination in 1962. They argued with him, disagreed with him but did not see him as a danger to the nation.\nThere are several instances of political outfits and fringe groups setting secession as their goal. We could traverse diversity, differences and dissent much better as a 12-year-old republic. At 67, we are making a spectacle of ourselves forcing one history and one narrative of nationhood on our campuses. Already, incidents at Ramjas and the Jodhpur University where a teacher is facing disciplinary action for inviting JNU professor Nivedita Menon has led to cancellation of talks and seminars across universities.\nAs ABVP, backed by political masters in Delhi and pliant vice-chancellors, moves from campus to campus disrupting talks and beating up ‘anti-nationals’ there is a real danger beyond ideological divides. After the McCarthy era, America saw almost an entire generation of students who became cynical about politics and forgot campuses could bring change.\nPolitics, never an honourable profession in this country, will get even worse if the best minds who can raise questions about the way we are governed keep away, leaving ABVP to monopolise discourse and indulge in wanton violence in the name of nationalism. Each point should be met with a counterpoint.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:06:27.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
