The UK government has also suspended advertising “pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way”.\nIn a statement on Monday, Matt Brittin, head of Google for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, apologised. He said: “I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content.
