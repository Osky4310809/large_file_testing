Well, there's a lot here to laugh and shake your head at, a fair amount that's just \"action movie tropes\" not specific to these two films (such as the sky vortex and the army of black SUVs), and a political riff that derails the commentary's overall good humor and sets up pointless YouTube comment thread fights (so, basically, it's a video that talks about Ghostbusters ). \nBut overally, definitely worth a watch. \nAssemble a team of the world’s most dangerous, incarcerated Super Villains, provide them with the most powerful arsenal at the government’s disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic, insuperable entity. U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller has determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose will do. However, once they realize they weren’t picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it’s every man for himself?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T05:59:54.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
