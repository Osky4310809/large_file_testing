Their inspired (and adorable!) tweets are what get is through the day. (And some tough political times — WeRateDogs’ Muslim ban tweet was inspiring .) But what you might not know is that WeRateDogs isn’t just a Twitter account. It’s also an Instagram . An online store . And, as of recently, a mobile video game called Good Dogs . Most importantly, they’ve also got a Snapchat. \nAnd yesterday, WeRateDogs shared the most pure Snapchat story we’ve ever seen. Happening now on snapchat: WeRateDogs pic.twitter.com/XHmUq3OlbQ \n— WeRateDogs™ (@dog_rates) February 18, 2017 Puppies — puppies, everywhere!\n\nWeRateDogs sent a member of the team out to play with eight perfect pups, and they captured some of the most incredible snaps we’ve ever seen. \nThey had puppies with fun app stickers. \nWeRateDogs / Snapchat Sleepy, snuggly pups. \nWeRateDogs / Snapchat And playful little pooches. \nWeRateDogs / Snapchat They also introduced some of the teensy tiny guys and gals — though not all eight puppies have names just yet. \nWeRateDogs / Snapchat WeRateDogs explained on their story, “These are 5-week-old Dudley puppies. They are white labs that have the most recessive hair color gene. They have pink noses and will have blue/green/yellow eyes.”\nThey also explained that they’d driven over 6 hours to play with the pooches. “100% worth it,” they wrote. \nBut their snaps weren’t just cute puppy pics. They also had that trademark dog rating humor. \n\nWeRateDogs / Snapchat Basically, this Snapchat story was the best thing that we’ve ever seen. Same goes for a lot of other followers who went gaga for the pictures on Twitter. \nImages like this is why everyone should be following @dog_rates on snapchat #OhHeck pic.twitter.com/DptNqr3FXe \n— Ciaran Hammond (@ciaranhammondk) February 18, 2017 We can’t think of a single reason you shouldn’t follow WeRateDogs on Snapchat. After all, they’ve know all about Snapchat etiquette. \nThis is Florence. He saw the same snap you sent him on your story. Pretty pupset with you. 12/10 \nA post shared by WeRateDogs (@weratedogs) on Feb 18, 2017 at 2:01pm PST \nAnd just look at this face. \nWeRateDogs / Snapchat Follow them on Snapchat at @WeRateDogs.
