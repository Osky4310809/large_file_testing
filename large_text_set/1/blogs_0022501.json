This is the fourth time Russian long-range aircraft carry out the operation in the area. \nLast week, Daesh terrorists surrounded the Deir ez-Zor military airfield in Syria's northeast. Deir ez-Zor airbase remains the last line of defense of the Syrian army on the way to the city. Despite numerous terrorist attacks involving suicide bombers and military equipment, the Syrian Air Force managed not only to successfully defend the airfield, but also counterattacked terrorists fighting in nearby territories. \nCommenting on the development of the situation in the area, the Russian General Staff said on Wednesday that if terrorists capture Deir ez-Zor, civilians will be subjected to genocide and the population may be completely exterminated. \nThe city of Deir ez-Zor, which is still held by Syrian government forces, has been under Daesh's siege since July 2014. The residents of Deir ez-Zor and the servicemen receive food only via planes delivering humanitarian aid. \nDETAILS TO FOLLOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T14:32:19.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
