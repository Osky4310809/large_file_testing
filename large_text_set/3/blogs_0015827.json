At least until their bitter rivals need snookers. \nThe Spurs players are also still talking up their refusal to give up on what looks like a forlorn bid to chase down Chelsea.

A brave new world is continuing to take shape at the other end of the Seven Sisters’ Road. \nWith an arguably inferior squad it is Spurs on course to finish best of the rest while Chelsea win their title back. \nThis win continued the north Londoners’ impressive record of not losing to any team, in any competition, at White Hart Lane this season. \nEven without Harry Kane, Tottenham were just too good for a Southampton side that took this to the wire. Pochettino had every right to be delighted at the final whistle. \nLet’s not kid ourselves, had Saints striker Manolo Gabbiadini not limped off with a groin injury during the first half it could have been very different. Spurs are yet to lost at home this season (Photo: REUTERS) Ben Davies congratulates Eriksen (Photo: Warren Little) \nThe fact remains, however, that Spurs once again waved away the myth that they are toothless without their Golden Boot holder. \nChristian Eriksen, Dele Alli and Son Heung Min had, between them, scored a total of 40 goals this season going into this contest. \nEriksen added a 41st after just 13 minutes here, curling a superb effort beyond Fraser Forster from just outside the box from Mousa Dembele’s assist. \nAlli added a 32nd-minute penalty when he was clumsily fouled by Steven Davis inside the box. \nPochettino said: “Dele always can surprise you. In the box he looks like a striker because he is more than clever, he has made his mark. Outside the box he plays like a midfielder.” \nThe strike was indeed Alli’s fourth in as many games and his 17th of the season. It also left Southampton staring down the barrel of what could have been a hiding.

In fact, Claude Puel deserves immense credit for the way in which he rallied his troops to fight back during the second half. \nSix minutes after the break, Nathan Redmond surged down the left, crossed into the box and James Ward-Prowse pounced at the back post to make it 2-1. \nEven Kane, watching at home, tweeted his anxiety as Southampton poured forward in search of the equaliser.

He now hopes to count on them again at Burnley next month as the run-in hots up. poll loading Who are the kings of north London? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T21:05:55.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
