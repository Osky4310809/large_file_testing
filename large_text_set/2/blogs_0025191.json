We expect that this neighborhood is very safe and there is a lot of families coming to this area,” Kevin Chen said. \nIf you have any information on this assault, you are asked to call Quincy Police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:10:15.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
