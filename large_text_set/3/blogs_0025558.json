It comes with an all-black 3.0 upper, leather cages and branding at the tongue and heel. \nRelease Date : May 31 \nPrice : Approximately $190 \nAvailability : adidas and select retailers. \nEditor’s Notes : We’ve seen a ton of different colorways across the adidas Ultra Boost silhouette over the last couple of years, but this one might just be its finest yet. The black upper is versatile enough to be worn all year round, and that bronze Boost tooling adds a definite air of luxury. A must-cop for Ultra Boost-heads. \nIn other sneaker news, here the 10 best air sneakers we saw at The Department of Nike Archives. \nSubscribe to Highsnobiety’s sneaker chatbot on Facebook to receive lightning quick updates on release dates, sneaker street style, shopping tips and more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T11:19:36.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
