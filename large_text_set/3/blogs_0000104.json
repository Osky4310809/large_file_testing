Show More \nKnown for their Gundam -inspired chrome fixtures, gold exteriors, and flashing neon lights, Japan's dekotora (which roughly translates to \"decoration truck\") are extravagantly painted DIY disco trucks, which first became popular in the 1970s. \nIn Great Big Story 's latest video in their \"Human Condition\" series, viewers meet three of the drivers preserving the culture, and they show off their respective 18-wheelers. Often embellished with decadent chandeliers and Louis Vuitton upholstering, they can cost upwards of ten million yen ($90,000 USD) and take up to 35 years to build. \nWhile the Transformers -like vehicles have been featured in countless movies, TV, and manga over the years, they've also appeared in music videos including Skrillex and Vic Mensa's \" No Chill ,\" Rich Chigga's \" Dat $tick (Remix) ,\" Mando Diao's \" Black Saturday ,\" and a recent commercial for luxury fashion house Gucci's fall/winter 2016 campaign. \nWatch the video above via Boing Boing . \nCorinne Przybyslawski is on Twitter .
