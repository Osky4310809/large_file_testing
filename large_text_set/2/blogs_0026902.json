Both of them are much loved and appreciated the world over, yet – back home in India, there seems to be a constant comparison between the two. In fact, last year reports started doing the rounds that the friendship between the two ladies has gone sour because of their careers. \nIn an interview to Rajeev Masand , DP broke her silence and confirmed that all is well in the hood. Deepika said: \nI personally don’t make anything of it. At a personal level, I know her way too well for any sort of comparison. It feels odd and it feels weird. Even professionally, I think we are both doing extremely well. But our worlds are also completely different. What she wants to achieve and what she’s working towards is very different than what I’m doing. Although it is in the creative space, I think her demands and requirements are in completely different from mine. She added: \nThe other thing that I find really strange is… just comparisons to her. I find them bizzare. Okay, even if someone had to compare, I’d understand a comparison with maybe Anushka or a Sonam or a Sonakshi… we came in at the same time. I understand comparisons like that. But I just cannot seem to wrap my head around this. 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:53:52.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
