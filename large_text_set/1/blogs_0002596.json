He was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Despite pleading guilty to the charges, his family wore “Free Alex” T-shirts inside the courtroom.\nPolice said that Francisco-Sebastion was arrested in connection to a sexual assault and a robbery investigation. The crimes were unrelated. Police said the two crimes happened four days apart in Portland, Oregon’s Overlook neighborhood.\nIn August, Francisco-Sebastion attacked a 54-year-old woman who was walking her dogs. He pulled her into the bushes close to the street and raped her.\nFour days later, he attacked a pedestrian on a bridge over I-5. He stole an iPhone but eventually was caught by police after they used the “Find My Phone” app. Francisco-Sebastion was only 18 at the time.\nLast week, Francisco-Sebastion pleaded guilty to charges of rape, strangulation and robbery. He sat and listened as statements from both victims were delivered. The 19-year-old can be seen smirking and holding back laughter while the statements are read.\nA friend of the rape victim read her statement.\n“I am praying that over the next 22 years, you are stripped of every ounce of power and control you think you have acquired, that you will be taught both by other prisoners and by authorities how powerless you actually are, and that you will personally experience all the pain you have inflicted on others,” the statement read.\nFrancisco-Sebastion’s family was present in the courtroom and many were wearing “Free Alex” T-shirts. The presiding judge expressed his displeasure with the family’s decision.\n\"His family's T-shirts are appalling. They're misguided at best, but to act like he's some kind of political prisoner in a 'Free Alex' T-shirt is totally inappropriate for today's sentencing,” he said. \"He's admitted to violent crimes that he committed and he's expecting an extremely long sentence and to have T-shirts asking for his freedom has no place here. I'm appalled by it.\"\nFrancisco-Sebastion will have to register as a sex offender when he is released from prison.\nSources:  KPTV ,  Portland Police Bureau  / Photo Source: KOIN\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T07:45:50.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
