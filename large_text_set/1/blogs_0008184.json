Prison leaders made the call to evacuate corrections officers as the Secretary of Public Safety said inmates were “getting ready for war.” \n“That to me was not shocking at all. That’s a normal day. An officer at least once a day somebody will find a nice homemade weapon like that,” Kelley said. “They all have protection. Every one of them.” Weapons from the prison riot at Souza-Baranowski Correctional Facility in Shirley. (Photo credit: Mass. Department of Corrections) \nFor three hours the inmates went wild — using those makeshift weapons and fire extinguishers to destroy sprinkler systems, computers, windows, and whatever they could get their hands on. They finally gave up when flooded with pepper spray. Kelley says it’s happened before and it will happen again. \n“When we go in there, and those doors lock behind us, we know that could happen at any time,” Kelley said. “We’re not overpaid babysitters. This could happen any second, any day, on any shift. At any prison.” \nMany of the inmates had their face covered in the video released by the Department of Corrections. Kelley said it’s less about protecting their identities and more in preparation for the pepper spray they know the tactical team will use to gain control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T07:41:03.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
