According to LAist , recently enacted Assembly Bill 1322 allows for the free serving of alcoholic beverages at barbershops and hair cut spots across Southern California.\nPer the Governor Jerry Brown-signed bill, as long as those establishments serving beer and wine do so without payment, then it’s all good. What’s more, the specific language of the bill makes it so that customers can’t receive more than essentially one glass each of beer or wine, and those drinks must be served before 10 p.m.\nBecause the bill went into effect on January 1, that means you can hypothetically catch a drink for your next haircut, no problem. Of course it’s all still at the discretion of the establishment, so maybe call around before showing up with a six pack looking for a bowl cut.\nKarl Strauss Brewing Gives LA New Craft Beer Crown Jewel [ELA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:39:31.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
