This makes the apartment space feel larger, natural light from the bedroom's windows and living room are fully utilized, helping apartments have better ventilation. The master bedroom has minimalist design, gently accompanied by large bathrooms enough for both husband and wife.\n© Thien Thach \nCats are special members of this family. Here, four cats with have their own toilet area designed inside the hidden toilet behind the locker system. The toilet area for cats has an extractor fan, cabinets for hanging cats's clothes and for some cats's special items such as sand , food, medicine ... They also have their own entrance to the master bedroom with the owner and some more stuff designed for them to play.\n© Thien Thach \nThe borderline between the master bedroom and social area, are defined by a glass panel with the objective of allowing in maximum light. Comes with paths for cats, they are free to access every single corner of the house. Cats also have water closet and built-in locker of their own with private entrance\n© Thien Thach \nWalls were removed to merge the old living room, kitchen and dining room into one single, open space. Used to be a ‘4 walls bedroom’, now it becomes a multipurpose room with a folding bed built-in. Dividing by a curtain and a million eyes-ceiling, the room is easier to breath than ever. The house was originally made up of small individual spaces, meaning it received little natural light. To counteract this issue, walls in master bedroom were swapped for glass.\n© Thien Thach ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:04:41.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
