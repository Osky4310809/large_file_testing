Pikachu dressed up as various other Pokemon, that’s what, and with the Japanese city of Sapporo currently celebrating its winter weather, there’s no better time to see new Alolan Pokemon plushes. More specifically, Pikachu dressed up as Alolan Pokemon.\nThe Pokemon Center of Sapporo is getting a special redesign to fit the winter weather, with Pikachu and Alolan Vulpix hanging out and having a lot of icy fun together. Starting on February 1, you’ll be able to head to the Pokemon Center locally and pick up a bunch of adorable items featuring the unlikely friends Pikachu and Vulpix having a wintry blast of a time.\n\nYou can select from adorable Pikachu dressed up as regular Vulpix or Alolan Vulpix, special clear cards with different designs (given out for free), one of five coasters if you spend over 2,000 yen and a whole bunch of other items meant to celebrate the season.\nA mascot dressed as Pikachu wearing a special Vulpix costume will also be appearing at Pokemon Centers throughout Japan, beginning on February 1 at the Sapporo location, at Mega Tokyo, Fukuoka, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nagoya, and Yokohama all the way through March.\n\nAlso, Japanese Pokemon Centers will be giving out special Alolan Vulpix Pokemon in Pokemon Sun and Moon as well. The Vulpixes given away will have ice-related items like Icy Rock, NeverMelt Ice, Aspear Berry, Ice Stone, and Ice Heal available with it, so if you can’t make it out maybe, you’ll get lucky with a Wonder Trade.\nThere’s too much cute to handle here so that the event won’t be lasting forever. It will come to an end on March 12, so if you’re going to be in the area or vacationing for some reason nearby, definitely stop by and check out the plushes at the very least, or keep an eagle eye out for eBay to snag one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:49:44.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
