Conley, a second-year wide receiver, got a tenuous grasp on the ball before getting swarmed by a fast-closing Davis. Davis may have been trying to lead with his shoulder, but instead landed a head-to-head shot on the defenseless Kansas City wideout.\nConley remained on the field for several minutes before walking off the field under his own power. He passed the leagueâ€™s concussion protocol and missed only one play.\nThe ensuing penalty gave the Chiefs a first-and-10 situation at the Pittsburgh 12. Kansas City trailed Pittsburgh 18-10 with under five minutes to play in their Divisional playoff clash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T06:09:06.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
