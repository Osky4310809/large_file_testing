View this image ›\nJennifer Lopez onstage during The 59th GRAMMY Awards. Kevin Winter / Via Getty Images\nID: 10516248 “This night is not about dresses or even the awards. It is about the music, the words and the voices. How they move us, inspire us and touch all our lives. At this particular moment in history, our voices are needed more than ever. As Toni Morrison once said, ‘This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self pity, no need for silence, and no room for fear. We do language. That is how civilizations heal.’ So tonight, we celebrate our most universal language: music,” she concluded.\nPresenter Paris Jackson used her time presenting to give a shoutout to the #NoDAPL protest.

We can really use this kind of excitement at a pipeline protest, guys. #NoDAPL,” she urged.\nKaty Perry’s performance of “Chained to the Rhythm” was a trifecta of protest symbols, with her pantsuit inspired by Hillary Clinton; her “Persist” armband inspired by Elizabeth Warren; and her pose at the finish in front of a “We the People” backdrop.

My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that will give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history, to confront issues that make us uncomfortable,” she read from the golden card she brought up with her.\n“It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first through their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House, and the Grammys, and see themselves. And have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent, and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel it’s vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes.”\nAnd Laverne Cox used her time onstage as a presenter to raise awareness for Gavin Grimm’s Supreme Court case .

I want to thank President Agent Orange for your unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban. We, the people. We the people! We the people! We the people.”\nAnd finally, Recording Academy President Neil Portnow used his annual Grammys speech to call for President Trump and Congress to have a renewed commitment to the arts.

Kevork Djansezian / Via Getty Images\nID: 10516359 “We are constantly reminded about the things that divide us — race, region and religion, gender, sexual orientation, political party. But what we need so desperately are more reminders of all that binds us together— our shared history, our common values, and our dedication to build for ourselves a more perfect union. More than a century ago, a poem was combined with a musical composition and became an instantly recognizable song the world over. Let’s see if you know it?” he asked. A trumpeter played a familiar tune. “‘America The Beautiful’ captures the essence of our country and reminds us that we are and always will be one people, from sea to shining sea.“In times of triumph and of tragedy, we turn to song and the abiding power of music to lift our spirits, soothe our souls and remind us that everything will be okay. President John F. Kennedy once observed, ‘The life of the arts is very close to the center of a nation’s purpose and is a test of the quality of a nation’s civilization.’ That’s so true. And that’s why we must be loud and clear in our unwavering support of music and the arts, and those who create it.\n“Behind the extraordinary artists you’ve seen here on our stage are hundreds of thousands of unsung musicians, songwriters, producers and engineers— American creators, whose jobs suffer from unfair rules and regulations, some going back 100 years. So, the Recording Academy, together with America’s music makers, call on the president and Congress to help keep the music playing by updating music laws, protecting music education, and renewing America’s commitment to the arts.\n“It’s our collective responsibility to preserve what binds us and to ensure that the whole world continues to benefit from one of our most unique, economically and spiritually important assets and exports: American music.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:40:26.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
