This ingredient has been around for a while, but its recent popularity can be compared to when glutathione was a hit. \nRightly so as dermatologist Dr. Anna Palabyab-Rufino once mentioned during the launch of Koragem Japanese Collagen that signs of aging start at 25 years old. Hence, the increasing need to supply our body with it to keep our youthful state, both skin and joints-wise. Before you panic, we already have products in mind which you can apply on your skin and also ingest to give you your ample dose of collagen at home. Deborah Lippmann 2-Second Nail Primer \nLet’s start with something small: the nails. Collagen can remedy fragile nails and prevent the appearance of peeling skin around them . Before applying your preferred nail polish, put a drop of Deborah Lippmann’s primer. Available at Rustan’s The Beauty Source. Mario Badescu Super Collagen Mask \nOatmeal and collagen is the mixture you need to reduce skin irritation and improve skin elasticity . This is also suitable for dry and oily skin. Just apply a thin layer of this Mario Badescu mask and wash it off after 20 minutes, and follow it with night cream. Available at Sephora PH . Belo Nutraceuticals Collagen Powdered Drink \nCollagen can also be ingested and it still bears the same effects as topical products. Belo’s powdered drink can be dissolved in any drink or food, and it’s recommended to consume two packets in a day. A fair warning as this drink does have an aftertaste. Available at Watson’s. Etude House I Need You Collagen Mask \nAdd this sheet mask to your “ alone time ” necessities as this is an easy way to achieve that youthful glow. Available at Glorietta 3. Murad Rapid Collagen Infusion for Lips \nYour lipstick will look even better if you have smoother lips. Murad’s Rapid Collagen Infusion is an easy way to improve the texture of your lips and make them look softer. Available at Rustan’s Makati. Koragem Japanese Collagen \nThis food supplement should be taken once a day for eight weeks to see the full effects. You can also get this if you don’t like the aftertaste of the powdered drink we mentioned earlier. Available at Mercury Drug. Bijin Nabe Beauty Collagen Hot Pot A post shared by Bijin Nabe by Tsukada Nojo (@bijinnabeph) on Feb 16, 2017 at 2:08am PST \nYup, collagen is also served as a dish at Bijin Nabe by Tsukada Nojo. The resto specializes in hot pots made with collagen broth. They utilize the traditional Japanese way of cooking collagen to incorporate it better with meats and veggies. Now we wish we can do this at home too.
