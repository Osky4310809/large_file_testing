And now, there’s a new featurette showcasing Emma Watson and the whole cast of Beauty and the Beast talking about this new the “Empowered Belle.” We can’t wait to meet her.\nDirector Bill Condon says this about her:\n“[Belle] really is the first modern Disney princess…who doesn’t want to be a princess. Someone who’s more interested in figuring out who she is than in finding a guy and getting married.” Disney Emma Watson was a huge fan of Belle as a kid. And, as a prominent activist, has also taken great care in making sure Belle is portrayed correctly in the upcoming Beauty and the Beast film. In the featurette, Emma explains how the team worked together to make sure Belle had characteristics that were important to them.\n“We wanted to give her this element of being quite industrious and very inventive.” It also seems like Belle is pretty independent and willing to show some sass in the film. Which, we think is awesome.\nDisney Watch the new featurette below to see how much care Emma and the team took with portraying Belle:\nYou can check out Beauty and the Beast in theaters on March 17th. We can’t wait to see the latest 21st century Disney princess Belle as she tackles challenges and reminds us to never judge a Beast by his outward appearance.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:16:58.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
