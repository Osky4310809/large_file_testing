Mark Meadows, R--NC, said after a meeting at the White House that are still not enough GOP members ready to back the bill. \nA Freedom Caucus spokeswoman said there are more than 25 members of that strongly conservative group who plan to vote \"no\" on the American Health Care Act, and urged a \"start over\" of the Obamacare replacement effort. \n\"If the vote were today, the bill would failed,\" said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Al., a caucus member. \nThe Freedom Caucus has maintained an overwhelmingly negative stance on the bill despite a full-court press from President Donald Trump and Republican Congressional leader to convince members of the group to back the American Health Care Act. \nThat bill, which would repeal and replace key parts of the Affordable Care Act, is scheduled to be voted on by the full House on Thursday. \nThe bill will need 215 votes to pass â€” one fewer votes than had been expected because of the scheduled absence of a Democratic congressman who will be attending his wife's funeral. That means that in order to win passage, Republicans leaders cannot afford to lose more than 22 votes from members of the GOP caucus. \nBut more than 22 Republicans have publicly indicated that they will or likely will vote no on the bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:38:23.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
