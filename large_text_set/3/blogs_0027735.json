According to a WHO report, 36 percent of the population in India is clinically depressed. That is one of the highest numbers in the world! It is ironic, then, that our understanding of mental health in general, and depression in particular, is abysmal. Or, perhaps, it is not ironic. Perhaps the reason that so many people suffer from the illness is because we don't talk about it enough. When it comes to depression, we are just beginning to understand the basics. For example, many of us still feel that the words depression and sadness are interchangeable, when they are significantly different (read more about depression is and isn't, on our website here ). We feel that there must be an event that triggers a bout of depression, that one can just do things to get out of it. Because of myths like these, we end up saying damaging things to our loved ones who suffer from the illness. Things such as... Snap out of it. No, no one can just \"snap out\" of depression. Just like one can't snap out of a broken knee. You are being too sensitive. Again, the very premise of depression is that one's feelings are not in control. They assume a life of their own. So, if someone cries over things that may seem minuscule to you, it doesn't mean that they are being overly sensitive. It simply means that they need help. Talk it out with a friend. Depression is not akin to having a bad day. It is a medical condition, and talking it out does not always help. Especially talking it out with a friend. The kind of conversation that someone with depression needs is objective, removed, and therapeutic. Only a trained clinical psychologist can provide this. Do this or that, and you will feel better. The thing with depression is that it makes you incapable of doing things. Yes, those who suffer from depression want to do a lot, but can't. People fail to understand just how difficult it gets sometimes just to get out of bed, and brush your teeth. There are people who have it worst. Yes, but there is ALWAYS somebody who has it worst. You may have a disability, be on the brink of poverty, yet not be clinically depressed. Or, you may be the healthiest person, with enough money and more, and solid, satisfying relationships, yet you may fall under depression. Depression may or may not be situational, and even if it is triggered by a life event or circumstance, it is hurtful and dismissive to tell someone that their problems are insignificant because someone else has it worst. It will get better. It may or may not get better. But, someone with depression is convinced that it will not. Trite statements such as this don't help. They don't offer a solution, or direction, and sound like false hope. If you have a loved one who suffers from depression, there are only three things you can do: 1. Listen Simply sit back, and listen to them. Do not offer solutions, or advice. This is much more difficult than it sounds. 2. Be there Help them with daily chores. Or, simply be there and offer them company. Go with whatever they want to do. They want to stay in bed all day? That's fine. Put on a movie on Netflix, and snuggle up with them. They want to go for a walk? Go along with them. Just offer company. That matters a lot more than anything you can say. 3. Get professional help Convince them to seek professional help. Because only a mental health professional can satisfactorily, and meaningfully, help someone with a mental illness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:13:15.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
