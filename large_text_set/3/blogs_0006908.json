People who spent more than two hours a day on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter were twice as likely to feel isolated than those who spent less than a half hour a day scrolling. \nProtect Your Head Trauma to your head can have long-term consequences: Researchers from UCLA discovered that head injuries can trigger changes in 268 genes , more than 100 of which have been linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders.
