We are shocked that the government did not keep to its promise to us. \n“What we have seen so far, I think it is about five per cent and it has been sliding since 2014 when it was 12; 2015, it came to 11 and 2016 it came to eight. If it is coming to five percent now, I think we will have problem with that, and at the appropriate time, we will make a comprehensive report, especially because we are engaging the National Assembly. \n“At present, we have some issues that we have been tracking and discussing. So if they assured us, we have to wait until they do their work on it before we make a comprehensive report. But we have told them in clear terms that we are disappointed.” \nOn what is going to be the consequence of the alleged poor budgetary allocation to the education sector, the ASUU boss said: “Certainly, you know that the value of naira has gone down, we protested in November and went on a warning strike because we found out that education has not been given its due pride of place.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:29:23.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
