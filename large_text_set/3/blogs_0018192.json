For former Arizona Cardinals safety Tony Jefferson, he got some virtual help. Aside from finances, which team gave him the best chance to win and all that, Jefferson wanted to make sure that he looked good wherever he went. It would have been easy for him to buy all of the different jerseys of potential teams or just photoshop pictures to see how he'd look in certain spots. But given how life-like video games have become, the 25-year-old (former) free agent turned to a gaming console. \"I am a guy of swagger, so I gotta check the swag at all points before I make a decision,\" Jefferson said, per Brooke Cersosimo of NFL.com . \"I put myself in different uniforms on Madden to see what will look better. Ravens did look good, though.\" There was one look that really caught the safety's eye. \"Black on blacks, no question,\" Jefferson said, per Cersosimo. \"Those [uniforms] are their best combination.\" Back in the day, free agents would have to just use their imaginations to envision what they'd look like with a certain team. Now, they can do so through the magic of video games. Technology is an amazing thing.
