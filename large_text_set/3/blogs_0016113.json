Lindsey Graham (S.C.) on whether President Donald Trump could be impeached for implementing waterboarding, Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch contended that “no man is above the law.” \nGraham questioned Gorsuch during his second day of confirmation hearings on the legality of the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique. Gorsuch answered in the affirmative when asked by Graham if the Detainee Treatment Act prevents waterboarding — which is when Graham began to ask about impeaching Trump. \n“So, in case President Trump is watching — which he may very well be — one, you did a good job picking Judge Gorsuch,” Graham said to laughter. “Number two —here’s the bad part —if you start waterboarding people, you may get impeached. Is that a fair summary?” \nGorsuch replied that the power to impeach a president belongs to the Senate. \n“That’s even better,” Graham responded. “Would he be subject to prosecution?” \nGorsuch declined to speculate, but when Graham pressed further and asked if Trump is “above the law,” Gorsuch had an answer. \n“No man is above the law,” the nominee said. “No man.” \nThe Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 prohibits the U.S. government from using “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment” on someone in custody. \nTrump drew criticism in January for contending that waterboarding is not a form of torture and contended that he believes it works. \n“Torture is real torture,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “Waterboarding is — I’m sure it’s not pleasant, but waterboarding was just short of torture, when all of a sudden they made it torture.” \nTrump did, however, say he is “with” Defense Secretary James Mattis, who Trump said doesn’t intend to use waterboarding. \nGraham also praised Trump on Monday for his selection of Gorsuch to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:55:51.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
