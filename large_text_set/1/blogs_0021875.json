It's also an attempt to drive a wedge between Trump and Republicans who are ideologically skeptical of a large infrastructure measures. Republicans successfully defeated a major infrastructure bill during the first term of former President Barack Obama's administration and have not enthusiastically embraced Trump's focus on infrastructure. \n\"We're challenging him here today,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said during a news conference. \"Now that we've been stymied by our Republican colleagues â€¦ now we have a president elect (sic) who has called for a large infrastructure bill.\" \nTrump has said infrastructure is one of his top priorities, even laying out a broad proposal during his transition. But with any major spending bill on Congress, the way it is paid for or financed often faces deep division between parties and sometimes even within political parties. \nSchumer wouldn't say how he would pay for it but suggested that one idea is to close tax loopholes or rely on the generation of revenue through job creation. \nHe dismissed any proposal to cut domestic spending as well as Trump's plan. Trump's proposal would be financed through tax incentives and public-private partnerships. \n\"We don't want all the benefits going to developers and wealthy people,\" Schumer said. \"How we will pay for it we will discuss with President Trump.\" \nThe Democrats' plan is wide-ranging, including $210 billion for roads and bridges, $180 billion for rail and bus programs and $110 billion for sewer and water. Another $10 billion would go for VA refurbishing and $75 billion for school infrastructure.
