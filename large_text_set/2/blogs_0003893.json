I mean, it had the usual features that you look for in a home; great kitchen large bedrooms, a huge backyard… \nAnd a pretty awesome secret underneath the property. 2 Mae Ryan/KPCC \nWhen they were touring the property, the real estate agent told them that the lot had a pretty ‘unusual feature’ in the back yard; a large, concrete-lined hole. They were told that the hole used to lead to a fallout shelter from the Cold War Era, but in all honesty, no one had gone down there all this time. \nWhich is surprising, because I would have been down there in a heartbeat. 3 \nOne day, they were feeling brave, so they invited some one from the local radio station KPCC and went down the rusted ladder and found an old door at the bottom. 4 Mae Ryan/KPCC \nInside they found a small fallout shelter, large enough for a family of four, full of everything you’d need to survive a nuclear attack. The bunker contained water, canned food, clothing, and medicine, as well as magazines and books. Everything was still pristine and vintage. 5 \nSo wondering who’d be the type of person to build a fallout shelter in the middle of a valley outside of Los Angeles, so they did a little research and contacted the media. While building a fallout shelter during the cold war was a common practice, to find one like this one, it must have had a pretty interesting story.
