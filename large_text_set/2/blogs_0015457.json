The producers of Scalped seem to be sticking to the source material while remaining true to its influences, and it’s the first major series with multiple leads of Native American heritage. \nMeraz and Gladstone will be directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah in the pilot written by Doug Jung. Jung is producing the series alongside DC’s own Geoff Johns . \nScalped is based on the original comic series by R.M. Guéra and Jason Aaron. The series ran for 60 issues, garnering a dedicated fanbase in the process. It's been critically acclaimed for its depiction of life on the \"rez\" as well as for being a unique take on crime dramas. \nWhether the series stays close to comic book roots remains to be seen, but with Johns overseeing a talented team of filmmakers—and great source material—it's a good bet that Scalped will be an entertaining offering in a world filled with comic-based adaptations. \nMORE SCALPED NEWS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:55:30.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
