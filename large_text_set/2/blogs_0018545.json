Check out the video for yourself below (language NSFW). So my IPhone 7 plus blew up this morning ?? was not even using it, literally no explanation for this pic.twitter.com/sQ8CJt4Y69 \nApple did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. But Cupertino quickly replaced the phone and is investigating, telling Gizmodo \"we are in touch with the customer and looking into it.\" Related Matte Black iPhone 7 Casing Unexpectedly Chipping \nOlivas told Gizmodo that her phone was acting weird and wouldn't turn on the day before the explosion. She brought it to a Sprint store, and an employee there told her something looked strange when the phone turned on, but they ran diagnostics and everything was fine. The next morning, the phone started smoking. \nThe incident is reminiscent of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle . While smartphone fires are rare, this is not the first such incident involving an iPhone. Last year, an iPhone 6 caught fire on an Alaska Airlines flight from Bellingham, Wash. to Hawaii. Prior to that a Canadian teenager in 2015 suffered third-degree burns after his charging iPhone caught on fire while he was sleeping. In that case, the teen's family believes a third-party charger purchased at a local gas station was to blame. \nThis latest incident doesn't appear to have been caused by a shoddy third-party charger. Olivas told Gizmodo that she always uses an official Apple charger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:15:11.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
