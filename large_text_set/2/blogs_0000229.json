It is important that there is good availability for our customers.” \nTesco said: “Due to bad weather conditions in Spain, we are experiencing a few availability issues, but are working with our suppliers to resolve them as quickly as possible.” \nA Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “Severe weather has affected crops, but we are working with our suppliers to maintain supply for our customers.” Courgettes were one of the first vegetables to be hit (Photo: Getty) Spinach could also soon be in short supply (Photo: Getty) \nThe problem has become so serious that British wholesalers have taken the unusual step of importing produce from California, despite the high cost of transporting it by air.
