Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Protests erupted across Washington, DC, on inauguration Friday and police responded with pepper spray, smoke bombs, and flash grenades to disperse the crowds. Police arrested at least 95 people. Clashes between anti-Trump protesters and law enforcement escalated throughout the day, according to American University Radio reporter Patrick Madden who has been following the demonstrations on the ground.

According to the Associated Press , “police gave chase to a group of about 100 protesters who smashed the windows of downtown businesses including a Starbucks, Bank of America and McDonald's as they denounced capitalism and Trump.” Many protesters quickly condemned the violence. On the ground, they confronted other demonstrators, telling them “not to destroy property” and that violence “only helps Trump.” As the inauguration ceremony came to a close, protests and tensions also began to die down, and crowds slowly started to disperse. But there were still occasional flare-ups as the day went on. The protests followed high tensions over the past two days as thousands of Trump supporters and anti-Trump protesters came to Washington, DC, to bear witness and speak out against Trump’s swearing-in ceremony as the 45th president of the United States. Security has been tight, with screening checkpoints surrounding the Capitol Building.

Police helicopters have been circling above the protesters. On the ground, law enforcement teams have been trying to disperse crowds, firing pepper spray and flash grenades. “Much different police posture this afternoon,” Madden reported on Twitter .

It was pepper spray, not tear gas. Was this article helpful?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:00:24.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
