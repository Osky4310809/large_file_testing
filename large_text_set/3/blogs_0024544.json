Related Thomas Gibson Fired From ‘Criminal Minds’ After Violent Incident \n“We were shooting a scene late one night when I went to Virgil and told him there was a line that I thought contradicted an earlier line,” Gibson said.“He said, ‘Sorry, it’s necessary, and I absolutely have to have it.’” \nGibson, upset, went back to his colleagues and told them about the encounter and while doing so Williams burst into the room directly toward Gibson. \n“He came into that room and started coming towards me. As he brushed past me, my foot came up and tapped him on the leg,” Gibson recalls. “If I hadn’t moved, he would have run into me. We had some choice words, for which I apologized the next day, and that was it. It was over. We shot the scene, I went home – and I never got to go back.” \nThere is speculation regarding Gibsons’ claims considering his violent past with other members of the production that resulted in him being sent to anger management classes.

He will appear on the first two-episodes of season twelve, but “creative details for how the character’s exit will be addressed in the show will be announced at a later date,” according to a statement from CBS Television Studios ABC Studios. \nFor now, Gibson says he is considering comedy, theater, directing or producing. \nSeason 12 of Criminal Minds premieres on CBS Sept. 28.
