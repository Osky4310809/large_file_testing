This is a very urgent requirement and the mics, along with the furniture, are to last for the next 4 years, the government has announced. Chairs must be strong enough to survive these people “The tender is slightly different from the normal tenders. We want to award the contract of supplying the mic and the furniture to the highest bidder. Low quality mics and furniture will break in a few months without the legislators doing anything legislative. The chairs should also be heavy enough to ensure that no MLA can lift them over their heads”, a Government official said. “The mics that we have currently, they are being used for everything else but speaking. The chairs that we have, they are being used for everything else but sitting. We have to change this situation before the next session is called. That is why the urgency”, he added. As per sources, there is also a plan to bolt all the tables to the ground so that no table is turned inside the assembly. During the recent trust vote, even tables were not spared by the MLAs so special attention is given to the tables as well. Meanwhile, the speaker of the assembly has asked for a steel cage around his chair to ensure no MLA comes to his seat and manhandles him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:58:07.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
