Animation, the 26th film in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series, remaining at No. 2 for the second week. \nThe two films also finished in the same positions on the Blu-ray Disc-only chart, a reversal of the prior week, when “Batman: The Killing Joke” debuted at No. 1. \nOn both charts, Walt Disney Studios’ “Zootopia” came in at No. 3. \nOn the overall disc sales chart, 20th Century Fox’s “Deadpool” shot back up to No. 4 from No. 10 the previous week, while the No. 5 spot went to the newly issued cartoon “Scooby-Doo! and WWE: The Curse of the Speed Demon,” a direct-to-video release. \nThe No. 4 and No. 5 positions on the Blu-ray Disc chart went to the Universal Pictures comedy “The Boss,” unchanged from last week, and “Allegiant,” from Lionsgate, the latest film in the futuristic “Divergent” series. \n“Scooby Doo!” generated just 10% of its total unit sales from Blu-ray Disc. \nOn Home Media Magazine ’s rental chart for the week ended Aug. 14, only one new release made it into the top 5: the Lionsgate drama “ A Hologram for the King ,” a comedy-drama about a washed-up businessman who travels to Saudi Arabia with a proposed business deal.
