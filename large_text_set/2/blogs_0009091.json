I’m a TV president,” says the Baldwin as Trump.\nDuring the skit, Baldwin’s Trump demands both a reinstatement of his travel ban and $725 in compensation from the judges who he believes wronged him.\nShortly after, Beck Bennett once again shows up as a shirtless Vladimir Putin in order to defend Baldwin’s Trump, who introduces him as “someone who’s known me for years, he’s family, he’s an incredible person with impeccable credentials.”\n“This man is a great friend. He’s my little American Happy Meal. He’d do anything for you. Go against his own country just to make you happy,” says Bennett’s Putin.\nWatch the full sketch above\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:19:38.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
