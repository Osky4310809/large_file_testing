The world's oldest Vespa is up for auction. \nThe scooter is from Piaggio's \"0 Series\" with the serial number 1003, making it the third prototype of 60 made by the famous company. \nBecause the first two have since gone to scooter heaven, 1003 is now the oldest Vespa. \nBut don't expect the scooter to go for cheap. Catawiki, the company hosting the auction, expects it to sell in the ballpark of $268,150 to $348,600. At the time of writing, the leading bid was $174,297, with five days of bidding left. \nWhen the auction is over, the deep-pocketed owner won't win just a museum piece, because this Vespa still runs.
