Katarina had 2 more base MR than she was supposed to. Whoops. Base stats Maokai Q mana cost up. E impact damage removed. Maokai has been the dominant super-tank in top lane, and not even the hefty Courage of the Colossus changes back in 7.2 felled this tree. Thanks to his seemingly-limitless waveclearing, the Twisted Treant has basically no losing lane matchup. We’re forcing Maokai to commit more resources if he wants to squash enemy minions, allowing opponents to win by attrition if they can sap him of his mana before a fight. Maokai will still be a mighty oak in the late game, but unless he branches into some early mana items, he won’t have the resources to farm and fight if he’s on the losing side. Q - Arcane Smash COST 45 mana at all ranks ⇒ 45/50/55/60/65 mana E - Sapling Toss Ryze Q bonus damage on E’d targets reduced. Despite 7.1’s changes to reduce Ryze’s early game safety, the Rune Mage is still machine-gunning everyone to death once he eventually scales into mid/late game. That said, this is a far larger problem in pro play than normal play, and nerfing base damages would just make that worse. We’re targeting Q’s bonus damage, ensuring power’s pulled more heavily from matches where Ryze players are far more diligent in priming their targets with Spell Flux before tossing out an Overload. E - Essence Flux Q BONUS DAMAGE VS FLUX’D TARGETS 40/55/70/85/100% ⇒ 40/50/60/70/80% Yordle Finger Unification Pass Don’t ask what we did with the fingers we cut off. It’s better for you not to know. JHIN WOULD BE PROUD Various Yordle splashes and in-game models have been updated to all have four fingers Armor Penetration Items There’s no denying Lethality builds are overtuned, but the solution isn’t as straightforward as “revert the buff from 7.2”. That buff addressed Lethality’s initial problem of being lackluster against squishy targets in the early game, and we want to preserve as much of that correction as possible. The nuanced (rather, lack-of-nuance’d) issue we now face is that Lethality builds are effective against everyone . To address this, we’re putting a damper on how efficiently Lethality builds pull in tank-busting items - washing out those builds’ intended weakness without significantly stalling their anti-squishy gameplan.We’re digging into three percent-penetration items this patch: Black Cleaver, Last Whisper, and Lord Dominik’s Regards. In each case, generic damage is being shifted into the specific strengths desired by the classes those items are meant for. Enforcing Lethality’s weaknesses by tightening up its alternatives creates space for other builds to shine while leaving Lethality itself effective in cases where it’s supposed to succeed.The result of this focus on the broader item system is that we’ve only got two direct nerfs to Lethality. One’s to Ghostblade; the other’s to the Precision mastery in the Cunning tree ( scroll down a bit ). Where we go from here will depend on how this patch shakes out, though there’s one step we know for certain we’ll be taking. Edge of Night’s got so much going on that changing it correctly is a more complex challenge than with most other items. We want to get this one right, so we held off on lumping it in with our initial batch of changes. Expect nerfs in 7.5. Youmuu's Ghostblade Lethality down. Up until the introduction of Lethality, Ghostblade granted 20 flat armor penetration. We wanted to avoid shrinking that number during the transition away from flat penetration, which was a big enough change to get used to on its own. Now that Lethality’s found its place in the stats system, we’re bringing Ghostblade in line with Dirk’s other upgrades. LETHALITY 20 ⇒ 15 The Black Cleaver Builds out of Kindlegem instead of Caulfield’s Warhammer. Health up, attack damage down. While The Black Cleaver is meant for fighters like Darius and skirmishers like Fiora, it packs so much offensive power that glass cannon champs are buying into it as well. We’re shaking up Cleaver’s build path and stat offerings to better align with the extended fights its intended users thrive in. Swapping Caulfield’s Warhammer for a Kindlegem works out well for champs who need to live long enough to cycle through several rounds of spellcasts, versus champs who want to down their target in one go.Fun fact: this is basically the version of Black Cleaver we had between patches 5.8 to 5.22, with a few gold numbers moved around. Though the change to Warhammer made sense in the 2016 pre-season, a lot’s changed about the game since then and the old version’s a better fit for where we are today. BUILD PATH Phage + Caulfield's Warhammer + 850 gold (3100 total) ⇒ Phage + Kindlegem + 950 gold (3000 total) HEALTH 300 ⇒ 400 Last Whisper Armor penetration up, attack damage down. For marksmen, reacting to tanky threats required a 2700-gold investment in the form of Lord Dominik’s Regards or Mortal Reminder. The problem: “build an end-game item” doesn’t pass muster as a ‘reaction’, given how long it takes to bank that much coin. We’re letting Last Whisper serve as that reactive purchase all on its own, at the expense of effectiveness against targets without armor to pierce. BUILD PATH Pickaxe + 425 gold (1300 total) ⇒ Long Sword + 950 gold (1300 total) BONUS ARMOR PENETRATION 30% ⇒ 45% Lord Dominik's Regards Damage bonus requires enemies to have more health than before. Lord Dominik’s draws an interesting parallel with The Black Cleaver: one scales with enemy health, the other with enemy armor. There’s no right way to itemize against that combination, so to keep LDR+Cleaver from taking over as the new flavor-of-the-month build, we’re making Lord Dominik’s far less tolerant of Cleaver’s bonus health. Fortunately, this shouldn’t impact champs who are happy to buy Lord Dominik’s on its own. PASSIVE Deal +1.5% physical damage per 50 ⇒ 100 maximum health difference against targets with greater max health than you (up to +15%) MAXIMUM BONUS THRESHOLD 500 max health difference ⇒ 1000 max health difference Giant Slayer Carry-over changes keep Giant Slayer and Lord Dominik’s consistent. PASSIVE Deal +1% physical damage per 50 ⇒ 100 maximum health difference against targets with greater max health than you (up to +10%) MAXIMUM BONUS THRESHOLD 500 max health difference ⇒ 1000 max health difference Items Knight's Vow Build path simplified. A support’s inventory quickly fills up with multiple items like Sightstone, gold items, boots, and wards, leaving little room for components. We want supports to feel comfortable building towards Knight’s Vow, so we’re simplifying its build path. BUILD PATH Crystalline Bracer + Crystalline Bracer + Cloth Armor + 700 gold (2300 total) ⇒ Crystalline Bracer + Chain Vest + 850g (2300 total) ARMOR 20 ⇒ 40 BONUS ARMOR WHEN LINKED 40 ⇒ 20 TETHER RANGE 900 ⇒ 1000 Masteries Fervor of Battle & Warlord’s Bloodlust A good trade is the first step towards winning a lane; repeat enough times and you can go for a kill. Hitting minions from range and lifesteal enables marksmen to weather the storm through lost trades far too easily. This is making bot lane pretty noninteractive; if there’s no real gain from risking a trade, why bother? We want to make sure trades feel worth the risk so aggressive bot laners can feel good about creating an advantage.
