The attacker was described as white, 6ft tall (182 cm) and stocky. \nThe attack has prompted fresh outcry in India following a deadly gun attack on two Indians in Kansas last month. \nIndian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj says she has spoken to the father of the man shot in Seattle, Washington, and that the victim is recovering in hospital after sustaining non life-threatening injuries. \nAt a news conference on Sunday, Kent police chief Ken Thomas told reporters described the attack as \"a crime of opportunity\". \nThe assailant reportedly wore a mask covering the lower half of his face. \nPolice have contacted the FBI and other law enforcement about the shooting, which may be treated as a hate crime. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Members of the Sikh community expressed solidarity with local police after the shooting \nA prominent US Sikh group, the Sikh Coalition, has called for precisely that. \nIn a statement, the group said: \"While we appreciate the efforts of state and local officials to respond to attacks like this, we need our national leaders to make hate crime prevention a top priority.\" \nSeattle-based Sikh community leader, Jasmit Singh, said: \"Investigating this as a anti-Sikh hate crime is critical, because without our government agencies recognising hatred for what it is, we can't combat the problem.\" \nThe incident follows the fatal shooting of an Indian national in Kansas City last month , in which the shooter allegedly shouted \"get out of my country\" before opening fire. \nThat attack is now being treated as a possible hate crime, and the suspect is in custody. \nThe fallout from the Kansas shooting reverberated across India, with some seeing it as a result of anti-immigration rhetoric from the Donald Trump White House. \nMany in the Indian community in the US have voiced concerns over Mr Trump's diatribes against Muslims and foreign workers accused of stealing American jobs. \nSikhs are sometimes confused with Muslims in the United States. Attacks against Sikhs were reported in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2011. \nFollowing the Seattle shooting, the Sikh community in Kent offered to help people understand their religious practices. \n\"We would be willing to teach them or answer any questions that they have - about our community, about our faith, about why we tie the turban, why we look the way we do - or anything,\" local Sikh community leader Satwinder Kaur said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T19:03:06.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
