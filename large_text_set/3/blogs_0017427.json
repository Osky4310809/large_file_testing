(Reuters) \nThe worst flooding in 30 years is scouring the arid landscape of coastal Peru. Exceptionally warm water in the Pacific Ocean is fueling torrential rain in western South America, which then comes pouring down out of the mountains. The extraordinary amount of water has overwhelmed surrounding towns. \nIt looks a whole lot like El Niño in Peru, but you won’t be hearing that description from climate forecasters anytime soon. \nFlooding is expected to continue for another two weeks, and the death toll is a moving target. However, 72 people have died so far as of Saturday, according to the Associated Press . In the capital city of Lima — an arid region that rarely sees rain let alone deadly flooding — authorities pulled people from the muddy water. \nOn March 10, Climate.gov’s Tom DiLiberto said rainfall in this region is running 10 times that of normal: \nWith more than a month left to the season, 2017 is already likely one of the wettest years on record for San Miguel in the Piura province. Around 10 inches of rain has fallen since January 1, when, on average, the entire rainy season usually totals just two inches of rain. Farther inland in the Piura region, a weather station in Morropón recorded 43 inches of rain since the start of 2017. At this point of the year — early March — Morropón’s average rainfall is about 4 inches. ONI 3.4 region is neutral, but Niño 1+2 along S Amer nw coast is toasty with SST Anomaly >3C; a major driver in current Peru flooding. pic.twitter.com/Qq3YtiE3iL \n— Jan Null (@ggweather) March 20, 2017 \nThe warm ocean water behind this month’s flooding suggests another El Niño may be forming. The water is so warm, actually, that Peru climatologists declared a “coastal El Niño” to communicate to the public the kind of conditions they should expect and prepare for. \nThe situation doesn’t meet NOAA’s technical definition of an El Niño, so you won’t be seeing the agency declare its arrival — perhaps for months — but meteorologists can’t ignore this technically unnamed phenomenon’s devastating impact. 1 of 25", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:01:24.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
