But she was overusing deodorant. \n\"It was more than we would have expected any girl to put on. \n\"But there was never a point we started to think there was an issue - not in the way we would have thought she was doing any sniffing or anything like that. \n\"There were no indications what so ever, I would have noticed. \n'I came to say sorry': Jeremy Hunt attends memorial service of toddler who died after NHS failed to spot sepsis \n''She was a strong character. \n\"My feeling is she was the way she was and there was no changing her no matter what we did she marched to her own beat, that was Paige.'' \nMrs Daughtry said her daughter - who attended Royton and Crompton School in Oldham - had been looking forward to the holiday. \n''Paige was looking forward to the holiday - we went every year,\" she said. Doctors said Paige had inhaled butane and isobutane from the tin - but said there was no evidence of 'chronic use' (Photo: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd) \n\"We did some swimming and went into Blackpool and came back. \n\"We were as a family together all day, she did have a bit of a strop that day - but that was her being a teenager. \n''Paige went into our bedroom and my husband went off to take some photographs on the beach. \n''From Paige going in her room and me shouting her it was about 10 or 15 minutes. That room was a bit cooler and the window was open. \n''I think that's why she decided to go in there and all the chargers were in there and she wanted to listen to music. \n\"I shouted, there was no response, I went in and sought assistance. I was screaming at the top of my lungs, trying to pull her off her the bed and phone 999.'' \nTwo holidaymakers from neighbouring caravans came to assist with CPR before paramedics arrived and took Paige to Blackpool Victoria Hospital. \nForensic pathologist, Dr Jonathan Metcalfe said the cause of Paige's death was ''inhalation of volatile substances.'' (Photo: Mercury Press) \nHe added: \"Analysis of brain samples revealed two substances present in aerosols - they are known as volatile substances. They are known to be present in Right Guard deodorant which was present at the scene. \n\"Their presence is consistent with inhalation. Death may result from the toxicological effects. The substances are butane and isobutane. \n''There was no natural disease that has contributed to her death. There was no evidence of heavy use and no direct evidence that there was chronic use.\" \nDet Chief Insp Jason Richardson from Lancashire Police said: \"A can of Right Guard deodorant was found located on grass outside the caravan, outside the open window of the en suite toilet attached to the bedroom Paige had been found - as if dropped out of the window. \n''It was found to be empty and was seized as evidence. Ann reported that she noticed Paige using a lot of deodorant.'' \nA coroner's officer said: ''It was established Paige had previously used deodorant - a direct quote from Mrs Daughtry herself being 'like they were going out of fashion'. An empty canister was found outside the caravan window.\" The coroner recorded a conclusion of death by misadventure (Photo: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd) \nRecording a conclusion of death by misadventure coroner Alan Wilson said: \"This is the unintentional consequences of a deliberate act. Paige was inhaling the fumes from the deodorant but what she didn't intent is the consequences. \n''It's most likely that inhaling those fumes has most probably led to her heart rhythm being affected and led to her death. \n\"It may have been in recent times she got into the habit of inhaling some fumes. I do find she was probably inhaling deodorant fumes for what ever reason during that day. Mr and Mrs Daughtry can I pass on the condolences of everyone here.
