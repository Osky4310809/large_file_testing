This was my new years eve beat aka #fotd #newyear2017 foundation: #esteelauderdoublewear in sandlewood mixed with #mufefaceandbody in cognac for some hydration because my skin is dry right now but still oily. Primed with milk of magnesium and #mufeprimer # 1. Used #mehron pro/HD foundation in color med/dark 4 under my eyes in my tzone. Then went over that with #lancomelonglastingconcealer in 310 set with #marcjacobspowder in 200 ivory bisque and #hourglassambientlightingpowder in diffused light. Set the rest with #lancomedualfinishpowder in 470. Cream contour came from the #mufeprosculptingpalette # 50 set it with #hourglassbronzers and #maybellinefitmepowder in 360 and #sheamoisturemandalydusk for blush I mixed #narsex habitat and #tartesurreal blush. Highlight I used #coverfxcustomenhancingdrops in #candlelight set with #macextradimensionskinfinish #beamingblush #lotd used #katvondbownarrow and #katvondnoble liquid lipstick lined with #macchestnut eye details will be in next post. #nofilter #ringlight #fullface #beatface #glammakeup \nA post shared by Fab Jennie (@fabjennie) on Jan 1, 2017 at 8:39am PST \nThe Extra Dimension Skinfinishes are $33 each, you can find these four shades at maccosmetics.com !
