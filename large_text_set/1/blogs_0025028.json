LePage Proposes Maine Government Ban Convicted Drug Felons from Welfare by Ken Meyer | 5:35   \nMaine governor Paul LePage is continuing his crusade against drug crime by suggesting that convicted felons will be banned from receiving welfare benefits. \nThe Republican governor is known for his hardline , controversial rhetoric when it comes to drug-dealing minorities. LePage has recently proposed that the state legislature cut funding for its General Assistance program, which helps illegal immigrants and other poor Mainers in getting the basic life necessities. \nAccording to NECN , LePage’s office is now proposing that convicted drug felons should be barred from food stamps and various forms of cash assistance. LePage also reportedly planned to institute suspicion-based drug testing for welfare recipients, but the Maine Sun Journal says that plan has been discarded. \nLePage’s plan comes as Maine legalizes recreational marijuana, and his proposal is facing criticism from those saying he is stigmatizing low-income households and drug offenders. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:46:15.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
