I have reeled out these figures to emphasise something; with us, you are in safe hands,” he said. \nSotubo said that the forum became necessary to engage actively with employers on the importance and impact of their role in pension administration and retirement process. \n”Part of the process includes helping workers have retirement plans through the opening of retirement savings accounts and regular remittance of their contributions. \n”The overall aim of the forum is to increase participation by more Nigerians. \n”This initiative was launched in 2014 to serve as a platform for sharing knowledge and information between employers and pension experts,” Sotubo said \nAccording to him, the Contributory Pension Scheme had maintained rapid growth since it was inaugurated in 2004.
