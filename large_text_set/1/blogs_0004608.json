The stance also earned him a lot of criticism from Republicans who have been on a mission to eradicate the essential benefits for YEARS.\nSee the original message (below): \nI was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2015 \nObviously, Sanders is afraid Drumpf will backtrack on his health care declarations once he becomes POTUS on January 20. It's a fair assessment since the President-elect appears to have no clear-cut political beliefs or even a conscience.\nFlanked by the YUGE tweet, Bernie told the legislators:\n\"Trump didn't just say this in passing. He didn't say it in the middle of the night. He didn't say it in a particular interview. This was a cornerstone of his campaign. He said it over and over and over again.\"\nNow if he doesn't veto these bills, it will prove he \"simply lied to the elderly and the working people of this country and just made campaign promises that he had no intention of ever keeping.\"\nWell said, Bern!\nRelated: Donald Is ALREADY Backtracking On His Biggest Campaign Promise! \nThe spirited politician added:\n\"Right now, before Congress wastes an enormous amount of time, Donald Trump has got to come forward ― maybe through a tweet, one of his tweets ― and say clearly that Donald Trump will veto any legislation that cuts Medicare, that cuts Medicaid or that cuts Social Security. And if he makes that clear to his Republican colleagues, we can save us all a whole lot of time and start getting to work doing what this country desperately needs to have done.\"\nAll good points. All we can hope is that Donald will stick to his promises…\nOn a lighter note, the massive printout did NOT go unnoticed by fellow politicians.\nFollowing the hilarious display, Bern's deputy communications director Mike Casca tweeted:\nearlier today, sen. ted cruz chuckled when i walked past him carrying this poster. pic.twitter.com/65iAY2106p \n— mike casca (@cascamike) January 4, 2017 \nLOLz! Who knew Ted Cruz had a sense of humor about his master?!\nCh-ch-check out Bernie's full speech (below):\n\n[ Image via C-Span / WENN . ] \nTags: bernie sanders , controversy , donald trump , funny , health , politik , social issues , twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:25:04.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
