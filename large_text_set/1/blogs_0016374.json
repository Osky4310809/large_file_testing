As a result, some of us have called for an independent commission or a select committee of Congress to investigate. But at a minimum, these allegations must be fully investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department, especially in light of the recent assessment by the intelligence community that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered a campaign to influence the outcome of our presidential election in Donald Trump’s favor. \nPrior to the publication of the CNN report on January 10, Senator Whitehouse asked you, “[w]ill the Department of Justice and the FBI under your administration be allowed to continue to investigate the Russian connection even if it leads to the Trump campaign and Trump interests and associates?” You answered, “if there are laws violated and they can be prosecuted, then, of course, you will have to handle that in an appropriate way.” Your response did not answer whether, if confirmed as Attorney General, you would impede or shut down a Justice Department or FBI investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election or allow the investigation to continue. The need for you to answer this question directly has only grown in light of the CNN report’s alarming allegations. Accordingly, please answer the following question: 1. Will you commit not to impede or shut down any FBI or Justice Department investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. \nAdditionally, Senator Durbin asked you prior to the publication of the CNN report whether you would recuse yourself from an FBI investigation into Russian involvement with the election and the Trump campaign. You responded that you “would review it and try to do the right thing as to whether or not it should stay within the jurisdiction of the Attorney General or not.” In light of the CNN report’s allegations, which you have now had time to review, please answer the following question: 2. Will you commit to recuse yourself from any FBI or Justice Department investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election? \nThank you for your attention to these important questions. We look forward to your prompt response. \nSincerely,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:16:30.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
