Those who peddled falsehoods were motivated sometimes by profit and sometimes by politics. \nBut some solutions have also been put forward. \nThe team behind BBC World Hacks - our news solutions-focussed journalism unit - has been looking into some of the most promising potential solutions. Humans check the most suspect stories \nFacebook, which came under heavy criticism for allowing fake news to be circulated during the election period, have taken steps to offer combat the issue. \nOne of those steps is the enlisting of the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN), a branch of the Florida-based journalism think tank Poynter . Facebook users in the US and Germany can now flag articles they think are deliberately false, these will then go to third-party fact checkers signed up with the IFCN. \nThose fact checkers come from media organisations like the Washington Post and websites such as the urban legend debunking site Snopes.com . \nThe third-party fact checkers, says IFCN director Alexios Mantzarlis \"look at the stories that users have flagged as fake and if they fact check them and tag them as false, these stories then get a disputed tag that stays with them across the social network.\" \nAnother warning appears if users try to share the story, although Facebook doesn't prevent such sharing or delete the fake news story. The \"fake\" tag will however negatively impact the story's score in Facebook's algorithm, meaning that fewer people will see it pop up in their news feeds. \nMantzarlis says there is as of yet no firm evidence that this actually stops fake news spreading on a large scale, and there are questions over how sustainable the programme might be. Facebook is not paying the IFCN members to provide fact-checking services. There's also nothing stopping the fake news from being posted and spread in the first place - and perhaps quite widely before being tagged. \n\"There is a lag, so until and unless a story is flagged as false that story does continue to spread on the social network,\" says Mantzarlis. Image copyright Facebook Image caption A screenshot of how Facebook's fact-checking system appears to users in the US and Germany Humans flag whole sites as fakes \nIn 2009, Le Monde , one of the biggest French newspapers, set up a fact-checking unit called Les Decodeurs (The Decoders). Increasingly the unit is turning its attention to fake news, and they've devised a web extension called Decodex. \n\"You just put it on your browser and then when you come to a fake news site you get a pop up appearing saying 'warning this is a fake news site',\" says Samuel Laurent, editor of Les Decodeurs. \"If you click on the tool you will have access to a little paper describing the website and saying why we think it's not trustworthy.\" \nThe extension is linked to a database that Les Decodeurs has compiled which ranks sites as \"fake\", \"real\" or \"satire\". \nBut there are several hurdles which likely prevent a relatively simple piece of software from being the silver bullet for fake news. Users firstly have to be aware of the problem of false stories. They have to know about the extension and be concerned enough to download it. And they have to trust Le Monde journalists and the paper's centre-left perspective. \n\"We know that we won't convince everyone and we know that fake news readers already think we are the fake news,\" Laurent says. \"Our goal is to just provide this tool for people who are really sceptical or who just don't know who to trust. \n\"People who have already fallen into the fake news vortex, it's too late for them.\" Use algorithms to fight algorithms \nAlgorithms are part of what spreads fake news - because juicy yet false stories which become popular can be pushed out to new eyeballs by the software that runs social networks. But some programmers think computer code could also be part of the solution. \n\"From an algorithmic perspective it's possible for social media sites to recognise that website was only created two weeks ago, therefore it's probably likely that this is a less trustworthy site,\" says Claire Wardle of journalism non-profit First Draft News. \nFirst Draft is working with Google and Facebook to explore whether they could incorporate code to stop the spread of fake news. Wardle is adamant that tweaking algorithms is not like censorship. \n\"I'm talking about a bit like a spam folder in your email, those emails still sit there, but you have to go to your spam folder to look for it,\" she says. \nBut human language and news stories are complicated in ways that computers have difficulty dealing with, and any automated method of fact checking risks reflecting the biases of the programmers who created it. \n\"There are some very smart people looking at automated solutions now, around automated fact checking, which can get up to about 80% accurate,\" Wardle says. \"I would argue we are always going to need human eyes at the very end to say 'hang on, have we got entirely duped'â€¦ we want a combination of algorithms and human experience.\" More on this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T12:55:34.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
