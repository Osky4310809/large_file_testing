Justin???? Did you pee yourself?? @justinbieber pic.twitter.com/VpO2ZUeqoR \n— amy | JUSTIN SAW ME (@AmySwagJB) February 23, 2017 \nDespite the fact he apparently peed himself, Bieber looked unbelievably calm while he walked through the lot and talked on the phone. When you pee yourself but you are Justin Bieber so you just don't care pic.twitter.com/yDzDY7KwEg \n— booty (@jbieberdonuts) February 23, 2017 \nAnd, as you can see in the photos below and above, it appears Justin Bieber’s per… pee walk wasn’t confined to just a West Hollywood parking lot. \nI mean, just look at this homie walking around the sunny streets with pee pants. Who pees their paints and then gets a green juice? More photos of Justin Bieber spotted out in West Hollywood, California yesterday.

Sorry, I really couldn’t resist. \nYes, TMZ already made the obligatory Justin Bieber is “pissed” at the The Weeknd joke, but that doesn’t mean we can’t talk about it some more, right? \nI’m seriously starting to worry about Justin Bieber’s health. Have I ever been so drunk I’ve pissed my pants? No, but I know friends in college who have! \nOne night, my buddy passed out drunk and peed his pants so bad he actually broke his phone due to water damage. That’s a true story! \nYou know who you are! Instagram \nAnyway, back to Justin, who is clearly not doing well with the fact his ex Selena Gomez is dating The Weeknd. \nI know you loved — love? — her, man, but you have to get over it. You can’t go around West Hollywood after you peed your pants just because you’re going through a rough breakup. REX/ Shutterstock \nWait, imagine Bieber didn’t even know he peed his pants. Could things really be that bad at the moment? \nJustin Bieber, figure it out! \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:08:49.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
