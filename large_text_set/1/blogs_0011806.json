The animal is believed to be an endangered Siberian tiger, and it was cruelly lashed down so that children and adults could sit on its back for photos.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4SDV_Xi3To\nThe video's description says the circus was performing in the Hunan province, and that the tiger was strapped down \"to be safe for everyone to take pictures - but the expression of the tiger is very desperate.\" When the tiger was finally freed, it bounded up and dashed away from the table.\n\nRelated: Tigers punched for fun at horrifying \"sanctuaries\" in China \nMashable reports that in China the God of Wealth is often portrayed sitting on tigers, and the act is associated with the deity. In the video a small child can be heard saying (as translated by Mashable), \"I'm scared, I'm scared,\" and one trainer responded, \"Isn't it cool to sit on a tiger? It can keep you away from the devil and earn you promotions and wealth.\"\nMany commenters condemned the actions of the trainers and the parents who gleefully allowed their children to sit on the poor tiger. One iQiyi user said, \"What kind of values are these parents teaching their children?\" Another user wrote, \"You can't earn much from this, and instead you've brought so much pain to the animal, do you think it's worth it?\" \nSiberian tigers, also called Amur tigers, are found in the Russian Far East, China's border areas, and possibly in North Korea, according to the World Wildlife Fund . There are only up to 540 of the endangered tigers left in the world.\nVia Mashable \nImages via screenshot \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T14:29:20.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
