It can be difficult to deal with negative thoughts all the time- when you are at work, when you are at home, when you are with your friends, when you are alone. If you can relate to this, don’t worry.\nFor some people, negativity is a part of everyday life, but it doesn’t have to be. There is one simple trick that you can learn to help get rid of negative thoughts – and the only thing you need is a spoon. Yes, really. This easy trick is super-effective, and you already have everything that you need. So, what do you do? Simply place the spoon in the right pocket of your jeans or pants. Leave it there and get on with your day. Whenever you realize that you are thinking a negative thought, take the spoon out of your pocket and move it to the other pocket. Do this every single time that you have a negative thought, even if that means you are moving the spoon every few minutes. Eventually, you will start to notice that you are cutting off the negative thoughts before they are finished so that you can get on with enjoying your day. Over time, this will become a habit, and you will realize that negative thoughts are no longer a big part of your life. This trick may be simple, but it works, as it helps you to stop dwelling on negative thoughts. It also teaches you to be aware of negative thinking so that you know when you are being negative.\nSo, are you ready to change your life for the better? If so, it’s time to find a spoon to put in your pocket!\nFeatured photo credit: Unsplash via pexels.com \nThe post Struggling To Be More Positive?
