And while Brady hasn’t commented on any of his friend’s policies, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, the New England Patriots quarterback’s wife, took to Instagram on Wednesday to support immigrants coming to the U.S. A photo posted by Gisele Bündchen (@gisele) on Feb 1, 2017 at 12:14pm PST \nBundchen hails from Brazil, which means she’s an immigrant to the U.S., too. It’s unclear if she ‘s a U.S. citizen — she would have a green card at the very minimum for being married to an American citizen — but Forbes lists her citizenship as Brazilian. \nIt’s not the first time Bundchen has spoken out against the 45th president, either. A fan asked on Instagram around the time of the election if she and Brady supported Trump, and Bundchen replied with an emphatic no .
