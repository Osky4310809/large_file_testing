However, officials said Wednesday there was no evidence of giardia entering the water supply.\n“No contaminants have been found, detected in our water system,” Bernard Lindstrom, interim executive director of the water authority, said during a news conference on Wednesday.\nLindstrom said the first round of testing showed that all the indicators are stable and that chlorine levels are increasing.\nThe scale of the advisory recalled the water crisis in Flint , Mich., where elevated levels of lead in the water affected the entire city of about 100,000. Flint’s water lead levels dropped below the federal limit in January.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:55:19.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
