I was very happy to be open about it,” he told the Radio Times . \n“I just thought, ‘Come on, somebody is going to say it before I say it’. \n“It was something I struggled with. And that was probably the vanity in me.

It’s not cheap… probably 20 grand.” \nBut the actor has ruled out plastic surgery. \n“I think it’s such a shame. There always used to be the sense that age adds character,” he said. \nThey have two grown-up daughters Peggy, 19, and Mary, 15.
