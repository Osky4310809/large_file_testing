(Photo: Pete Marovich, epa) 563 CONNECT 30 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nOn Tuesday President Obama commuted the sentence of Army private Chelsea Manning, who was convicted of espionage for leaking 700,000 classified defense documents and numerous videos to WikiLeaks. \nThe hypocrisy of this move is breathtaking. Obama issued the clemency after weeks of extreme umbrage from congressional Democrats, as well as members of the outgoing administration and liberal pundits, at Russia's alleged “hacking” of the 2016 election. The prevailing theory is that Moscow engineered the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton adviser John Podesta, and then sent them to WikiLeaks where they were used to derail Hillary Clinton's campaign. \nThere is no question that in both cases, a crime was committed. But Manning compromised U.S. national security, placed the lives of members of the armed services and intelligence community and their assets at risk, and damaged the war effort against terrorism and violent extremism. By contrast, the DNC hack did not reveal classified information, no one’s life was threatened because of it, and it can’t be proved to have changed a single vote in the U.S. election. \nMost of the revelations were Inside-the-Beltway political stuff of no interest to the average voter. For those of us who followed the DNC leaks closely, the daily anticipation of what might be revealed was more compelling than what ultimately turned up. \nBecause Manning was granted clemency, shouldn’t the DNC hacker, whoever he or she is, be let off as well? Otherwise, the message seems to be that actual espionage against the United States for causes Obama seems to favor is just fine, but embarrassing the president’s party and his handpicked successor is a high crime against democracy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T04:57:46.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
