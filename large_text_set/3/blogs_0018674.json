(Dallas County Sheriff's Department) \nDallas police arrested Kevin Kidd, 18; Jermon Simmons, 24; and Emmanuel Kilpatrick on Monday. The three admitted to their roles in the slayings and face a capital murder charge, police said. Father, son found dead in southeast Oak Cliff apartment \nWitnesses told police they saw Walton Sr. go into his apartment the night before the bodies were found with a woman who had light-colored hair. They later heard several gunshots in the area and saw several men and a woman leave the apartment, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. Joy Tiara Gray \nBefore they left, the men also loaded a large television into the vehicle, one witness told police. \nDetectives scanned Walton Sr.'s cell phone and found he had been in contact with Joy Tiara Gray, who matched the witness description of a light-haired woman, according to police documents. \nPolice arrested Gray on Friday on a city of Dallas ticket. She admitted to detectives that she was with the Waltons in their apartment and texted one of the suspects to let him know what electronics were inside, the affidavit stated. \nGray, 21, gave police the names and nicknames of two of the suspects and identified all three in a photo lineup on Monday, the affidavit stated. \nShe has been charged with aggravated robbery, and is being held in the Dallas County Jail on $25,000 bail. Kevin Kidd \nPolice arrested Kidd on traffic violations Monday. Kidd told police that Kilpatrick asked to be driven to some apartments. Kidd said he waited outside the apartment for about 15 minutes until Kilpatrick motioned to pull the vehicle closer, the affidavit stated. \nHe said they loaded an Xbox game console, numerous games and two televisions, including a 65-inch LG, from the apartment into the car, the affidavit stated. \nHe told detectives that when he went into the apartment he saw the two victims on the floor with their hands tied behind their backs. He said Simmons asked him to re-tie the younger man who had been struggling so that he couldn't break free. As he was tying Walton Jr., Kidd overheard Kilpatrick asking where the key to the safe was, according to police documents. Emmanuel Kilpatrick \nKidd told police he then left to go home and saw Simmons and Gray leave the apartment, but not Kilpatrick. The four all met up later, the affidavit stated. \nKilpatrick, who was arrested Monday on an aggravated assault warrant, told police Simmons called him to the apartment to take some TVs, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. \nHe said he helped load two TVs into Kidd's vehicle, and as he was leaving he saw Simmons with a pistol and heard multiple gunshots. Kilpatrick told detectives Simmons later said he had to shoot the younger man because he was getting loose from the restraints, the affidavit stated. Jermon Simmons \nAfter being arrested on traffic violations Monday, Simmons admitted to being at the apartment and taking a TV, but said Kilpatrick was the only person with a pistol, according to police documents. \nSimmons added that a Sony PlayStation 4 was also taken from the apartment, but that he threw it into the Trinity River. \nKidd, Simmons and Kilpatrick were booked into the Dallas County Jail late Monday night. Bail will been set at $500,000 for each. View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:07:47.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
