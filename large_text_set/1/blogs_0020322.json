But one thing that took a nosedive due to these advancements is the battery life. The battery of a smartphone is probably the one thing that has advanced at a much slower rate than other hardware. But, better late than never. With brands pushing beefier batteries even inside slim phones, we’re finally seeing some worthy long-lasting devices. The fact that other hardware like processors and cameras have become highly efficient adds to the cause. \nSo if you’re in the market looking for a battery-centric phone that doesn’t burn a hole through your pocket, you’re at the right place. Here are the top five smartphones with powerful batteries, all priced below Rs 15,000. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Rs 9,999 onwards) \nWith the kind of popularity enjoyed by its predecessor, the recently unveiled Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has some big shoes to fill. The Redmi Note 4 certainly seems promising in that respect as it not only improves the design and shooting capabilities of the Redmi Note 3 (read: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 vs Redmi Note 3 ), but also takes a big step forward in terms of battery life. The shift to the highly-efficient Snapdragon 625 SoC means that the massive 4,100mAh battery lasts way longer than the 4,050mAh battery of the Redmi Note 3. The phone is no slouch when it comes to performance either, as it can run almost anything you throw at it without breaking a sweat. With up to 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a beautiful 5.5-inch full HD display, the Redmi Note 4 comes across as an attractive, all-round package.

Fuelled by a 3,500mAh battery, the 5-incher uses the next-gen USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer. What’s more is that the device comes with support for Quick Charge 3.0, resulting in faster charging times. The handset is available in 3GB RAM / 32GB storage and 4GB RAM / 64GB storage variants. All said and done, the Lenovo Z2 Plus strikes a balance between battery life and performance.

Not only does it come with a beefy 4,000mAh battery with fast charging support, but also with a future-proof USB Type-C port that is slowly becoming the norm. Powering the phone is the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, aided by 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 510 GPU. The major highlight of the device are its 13MP dual cameras at the back, something not every phone can boast about in this segment.
