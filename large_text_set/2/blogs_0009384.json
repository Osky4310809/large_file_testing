But I'd be very surprised if The Bachelorette in the summer isn't diverse. I think that's likely.\" \nFollowing his remarks, Jojo Fletcher, who is half Persian and half Caucasian, nabbed the main role for Season 12, causing fans to slam the network's choice on social media, saying Fletcher was not diverse enough.

I think one of the big changes that we need to do is increase the pool [of contestants] in the beginning.\" \nThe current season of The Bachelor has had the most diverse pool of contestants. \nFrom Viall's original 30 ladies, eight were non-white, in comparison to five diverse contestants the season before with main man Ben Higgins and just one non-white contestant in Chris Soules' season.
