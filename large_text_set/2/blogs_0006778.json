As private citizens in a private organization, we will stand ready to protect our own families and friends, our property, and our liberty from leftist chaos. Moreover, we will be ready to assist our local and State authorities in keeping the peace should they find it necessary to “deputize” private citizens for that purpose. \nIt remains to be seen what actions the new “Southern Defense Force” [SDF] will take to “plan for contingencies – natural or man-made –– that might affect the Southern people.” But announcements of plans to militarize the League are not new. \nIn 2014, the group began developing and training a paramilitary unit called the “Indomitables” to advance a second secession, though such efforts fizzled quickly. \nMy dad likes to ask how long it would take to raise a million man Confederate army to refight the civil war today. I’d say a couple weeks at most.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:29:41.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
