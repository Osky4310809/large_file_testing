Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and Trump’s son-in-law, is said to be open to the proposal but hasn’t made up his mind,” Bloomberg reported.

Advertisement - story continues below \nOne means companies do this is by selling goods and services to their overseas subsidiaries at a reduced price and then buying other goods and services back at a higher price. \nThereby, companies minimize their U.S. profits , which are taxed at a 35 percent corporate rate — the highest in the world– and maximize their profits in their overseas subsidiaries at the lower tax rate. \nThe border adjustment fee, coupled with lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent (which Ryan has called for) would take away this incentive. \nRetail companies — like Walmart and Nike — who import many of the products they sell oppose the proposed border adjustment fee because they believe it will affect their bottom line by forcing them to raise their prices.
