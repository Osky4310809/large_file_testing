Even so, Windows 7 still accounts for 40 percent of the desktop operating system market share. Neither Intel or Microsoft support Windows 7 with drivers for Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, but AMD is set to throw Windows 7 users a lifeline with its forthcoming Ryzen chips. \nThe announcement of Windows 7 support for Ryzen processors was made during an information session held by AMD and reported by German-language website Computerbase (translated). \nRyzen processors use the Zen microarchitecture , the AM4 socket, and are expected to launch in March this year. The 14nm chips support DDR4 memory and will offer between 2 and 8 cores for the consumer market and up to 32 cores for servers. The first Ryzen processor expected to appear in March is an 8-core, 16-thread performance desktop chip with a clock speed of at least 3.4GHz. It does not include an integrated GPU.

It's unclear exactly why AMD would go to the trouble of doing this beyond making Ryzen accessible to the widest possible market. Even so, surely consumers upgrading to a Ryzen-based desktop PC would also opt for a move to Windows 10 . \nIt may be the case that Windows 7 is still required to run certain pieces of bespoke software in a business setting. Here AMD could see an opportunity to win some major corporate contracts because it can replace aging hardware while retaining the software platform a company relies upon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:55:17.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
