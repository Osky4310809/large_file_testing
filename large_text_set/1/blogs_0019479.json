Hail our people!” During his speech at the gathering, Spencer said, “To be white is to be a striver, a crusader, an explorer and a conqueror .” \nFor those reasons, many have delighted in the video of Spencer getting punched — and punched hard at that. Many took to remixing the video by setting it to music, creating some hilarious results. Here are 18 of the best. \n“The Boys Are Back in Town”– Thin Lizzy \nOne assumes the boys came back to town because they’re not happy about neo-Nazis.

True fact: Adding the Indiana Jones punch sound effect and the Wilhelm Scream to that video of the Nazi getting punched makes it glorious. pic.twitter.com/fpaqTW8D13 \n— Ian Higton (@IanHigton) January 21, 2017 \n“Blue Monday”– New Order \nPercussion inspires some great punching remixes. \n“Angel of Death”– Slayer \nThe highest energy of the remixes may also be the most ridiculous. \n\n“Der Fuehrer’s Face” \nCalling back to a 1943 anti-Nazi Donald Duck cartoon may perfectly illustrate what people find funny about this video.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:20:38.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
