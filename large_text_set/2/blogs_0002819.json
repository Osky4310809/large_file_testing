By Linda Fliss   2:20 pm Linda Fliss with Wilbur. Photograph courtesy of Linda Fliss \nMy family and I love to cruise. It’s a great way to visit many different locations in a single trip, with someone else driving and amazing fruity drinks! Last year we visited Grand Turk—an island off the coast of the Dominican Republic. When the boat departed, I ran into someone who told me they had run “to the lighthouse” there, and taken a selfie with a wild donkey. \nGod, I was so jealous!

I could only wish to ever be able to do something as amazing as run on an island with frolicking wild donkeys. I mean this is the stuff dreams are made of, right? Unfortunately, my anxiety was pretty unmanageable at that point. \nYou see: I have a condition. It’s not just your average run-of-the-mill nervousness, but an actual disorder called Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Lucky me, right? We all have our own particular brand of “crazy” and this one is mine. I’ve decided to embrace it because denying it never got me anywhere except frustrated. \nWhat this means is that I have less tolerance for life than other folks. It also means that I have to regularly pull up my big-girl pants (like a freaking badass) and move though many situations that others may see as relatively minor, but that I find terrifying. It’s exhausting. Everything, every day, is exhausting. \nAt that time, I had too few tools in my toolbox to deal with the panic. But the run was something that stuck in my mind. \nAs a life coach, and a fiercely determined human, I worked over the next year to expand my window of tolerance. After all, I’m a business owner and I am forced to do things on a regular basis that scare me. \nI worked on it, and when we planned a cruise with my kids last December, I saw that one of the stops was Grand Turk. \nFor the months leading up to the cruise, I planned. I calculated that the entire run would be around 6 miles. Physically, I knew I could do it, however the trip would take me into the surrounding areas of an unfamiliar country, and I had concerns about safety. \nI had a difficult time distinguishing “real” safety concerns with the anxiety-fueled brain chatter I manage on a daily basis. \nPeople with anxiety are nodding their heads right now. The struggle is real. \nI decided that I would be okay as long as I took reasonable precautions. My husband, who runs, but hasn’t yet declared himself a “runner” (he’s stubborn) gallantly offered to run with me. \nI was set! \nMy kids were afraid for me and thought I was being reckless. I understood their concern. Anxiety has convinced me that the world was pretty scary, and for many years, I believed it. I never took risks. \nMy family didn’t understand the significance of the run. It was less about the actual run and more about overcoming the fear that I manage on a daily basis that keeps me from fully living my life (I’m not sure I could emphasize this more). This particular run was also proving my fear-kicking badassary. And the prize at the end was getting to see a wild donkey! \nWe saw many donkeys on our run but for some reason, they all ran away from me. I couldn’t understand it. I tried to lure them closer by speaking softly and offering them cucumbers (I totally forgot to research donkey snacks). Apparently, my “speaking softly” is different from my husband’s because he said I was “screaming and chasing them.” \nI am the animal lover in our relationship, however, so you can decide for yourself whose story is more accurate. \nMy husband was less than excited after we got lost and had to call a cab. Apparently, I miscalculated the miles and it was actually closer to 12. Oops. My husband, the not-yet-declared-runner, wasn’t amused. \nBut I remembered emergency cab fare! I think we can all agree that the important lesson to take away is “be prepared.” Not anxiety-fueled prepared, but normal-level prepared. \nWe got into the cab and realized we didn’t have enough money to make it to the light house to see the less antisocial donkeys, but after seeing my disappointment, the kindest cab driver in all of Grand Turk agreed to take us up to the light house anyway, and I met Wilbur. That’s him up at the top of the article. (I named him. Isn’t it perfect? He totally looks like a Wilbur.) \nI had completed my very first donkey run and kicked anxiety’s ass (not Wilbur the Ass) like a freaking badass! \n* * * \nLinda Fliss is a life coach and active runner.
