And the way this society said we are going to pay for high school because you need high school, this society should say we're going to pay for college because you need college to be successful,\" Cuomo said in a speech at LaGuardia Community College.\n\nCuomo went on to say that attending college today is \"...like starting a race with an anchor tied to your leg...\" due to the rising cost of education. \ngetty \n\nGovernor Bernie Sanders gave high praise for Cuomo's initiative, which has yet to be approved by state legislature. \ngetty \n\"It is basically insane to tell the young people of this country we want you to go out and get the best education you can, we want you to get the jobs of the future, oh, but by the way, after you leave school, you are going to be $30,000; $50,000; $100,000 in debt,\" Sanders said.\nIf state legislators approve the Excelsior Scholarship which is supposed to supplement current state-sponsored tuition initiatives for NY State Citizens, the plan will take three years to implement and cost $167 million a year. \nThe long-term costs of having a more skilled and educated workforce, however, could yield much more for NY state. Especially considering that home ownership, rent, and other cost-of-living expenses are really high .
