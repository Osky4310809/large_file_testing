I was democratically elected for a four-year tenure and I have just spent eight months in office. \n“My constitutional mandate as state chairman is to run the affairs of the union for four years like every other reputable union in the country.” \nHe noted that before the present administration came to power, members of the union used to chase their officers with cutlasses and guns but since Governor Olusegun Mimiko came on board, he supported the use of constitution and democratic means of changing officers.” \nVanguard gathered that the chairman outburst was as a result of alleged plan by some former union leaders sympathetic to the incoming administration to forcefully sack the present leaders. \nThe former leaders have reportedly perfected plans to root out the Ariyo led executive which was believed was installed by the outgoing government of governor Mimiko. \nFindings showed that the Chairman’s warning was to check mate the other group from carrying out their plans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:50:27.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
