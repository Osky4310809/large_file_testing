King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 17 hours ago 8 \nWith the classic Smashing Pumpkins lineup quite likely getting back together, band's early producer Butch Vig was recently asked whether he might be part of the comeback for a bit of studio work. \nThe producer said on Pensado's Place (via Alternative Nation ): \"We've sort of talked kind of loosely about recording some songs together. I've been in touch with Billy. \n\"I don't know if I could do an album with him, we would probably kill each other. He may be a father, he's mellowed a little bit, but he's still pretty damn intense. \n\"I also run into James Iha a lot, because it looks like his son might be going to school where my daughter goes to school. I see him at a breakfast place in Silverlake in the neighborhood. James is awesome, and James and Billy have been working again together, so it's possible. \n\"For one of the box sets that came out, I went and remixed the original 7-inch single, it had ' Tristessa .' Billy sent me the tapes, and it was sort of shocking for me to hear, because there were a lot of effects on the mix we did, like flanging, chorusing, and reverb. \n\"When I did the remix, I kind of just put the faders up and added a little bit of slap echo to Billy's vocals, and just mixed it like that, so it was just really dry. God did it sound good, the band was just so powerful sounding. I know Jimmy Chamberlin is playing with them too. If Jimmy is playing with Billy, that's really the core and feel of their sound. So fingers crossed, maybe we'll get in the studio at some point in the future.\" \nWhen it comes to the classic lineup, drummer Jimmy Chamberlin is already back in the fold and guitarist James Iha recently rejoined the band for select live shows. As for D'arcy Wretzky, Billy Corgan revealed reconnecting with the bassist in summer 2016.
