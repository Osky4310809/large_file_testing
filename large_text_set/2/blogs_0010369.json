Eastbound lanes remained open. \nThe California Department of Transportation reported about 2:30 p.m. Monday that mud and debris slid across westbound I-80, blocking both lanes . But around 2:45 p.m., Caltrans said on Twitter that one lane remained open westbound through the Baxter area. \nOn Facebook, the Truckee CHP office said, “Caltrans had a ton of equipment in the area and was able to clear a lane quickly.” \nThe Baxter area was the site of a mudslide Friday morning that closed traffic in both directions into the night. While eastbound lanes reopened around midnight, westbound lanes did not open until about 12:30 p.m. on Saturday. \nHighway 50 remains “indefinitely closed” because of several mudslides that have been difficult to clear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:02:39.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
