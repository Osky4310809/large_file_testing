How do you fight them? By producing and storing your own electricity onsite, like Sierra Nevada Brewing.\nThe company just finished installing a 1 Megawatt-hour battery array at their Chico, California headquarters. It’s one of Tesla’s massive Powerpacks, just like the five dozen that help power the entire island of Ta’u in American Samoa. As amazingly meta as it would have been, these are not the crazy beer waste batteries we told you about back in October of last year.\nSierra Nevada’s new Powerpack, loving crafted by Tesla\nSierra Nevada has tremendous power generation capabilities at the brewery. Thanks to nearly 11,000 solar panels — which they say is one of the largest privately-owned arrays in North America — they can already meet about 20% of the brewery’s power demands.\n\nThey could also power 260 or so average American homes, but, hey, we still need delicious beer to drink. And brewing beer on the scale of more than a million gallons a year means boiling a hell of a lot of water.\nAdditional power at the Chico site is generated by ten microturbines that produce about 2 megawatts. That extra power gets pumped to the Powerpack, where it’s stored to help the company fight off demand charges during times when the solar panels aren’t producing at their peak.\nThat’s important from an environmental standpoint, but also from an accounting standpoint. Cheri Chastain, Sierra Nevada’s sustainability manager, says that the company spent more on demand charges than they did on actual electricity in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:40:58.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
