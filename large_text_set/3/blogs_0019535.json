They just log into their Apple account, and all of their data on the iCloud moves neatly over to their new device.\nOf course, Android users are equally satisfied with the modern update process. Logging into your Google account provides the same relatively seamless transfer: nothing lost, nothing misplaced.\nHowever, what about users who aren’t so married to a single OS? What about people who enjoy using an iPad alongside their Android phone and who also like to use Windows?\nFor many, the emerging solution is IDrive : an unlimited cloud backup service that works for all of your mobile devices whether they’re iOS, Android, or Windows . Rather than a monthly subscription, for a limited time you can snag lifetime access for just $19.99 .\n\nThe lifetime unlimited service plan normally runs for $50 , so we’re calling this a pretty smooth deal.\nThe encrypted service has seen high reviews from the likes of Cloudwards, and the storage system syncs up with all your social media in case you’re interested in sharing. Your contacts, photos, videos, calendar events, and other data are instantly available across up to 5 devices simultaneously.\nIDrive in a nutshell: 256-bit AES encryption with an optional user defined key Back up your iOS device and restore it to your Android and vice versa Access backed up files from any mobile device, or through the web Share your files with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and email IDrive features Facebook & Instagram backup If you’re interested in keeping a plethora of devices synced in harmony or just want to ensure that your data stays safe regardless of what OS you choose in the future, then you’ll probably want to click here to get the full scoop for yourself.\nIs this deal not quite right for you?
