Pochettino also has an inner steel, a single-minded determination which is driving Tottenham and has lifted them back into the title race. \nPochettino went three at the back, he is bold enough to change his style for particular matches and his tactics outwitted Conte and ultimately defeated Chelsea.

Tottenham's Dele Alli scores their first goal (Photo: Reuters) Dele Alli celebrates (Photo: Reuters) \nAlli is the player who gives Tottenham their X Factor, something different and his runs from midfield are a huge threat. \nHis connection with Harry Kane - the pair of them have a telepathic understanding - is brilliant because they know exactly where to look for one another. \nIt was Christian Eriksen who provided both crosses for Alli’s headed goals, the Tottenham midfielder using his strength and power to out jump the Chelsea defence. Alli adds his second (Photo: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images) Alli celebrates his goal (Photo: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images) \nHis second goal after 54 minutes lifted the roof off White Hart Lane because that was the moment the home crowd really believed they were going to end Chelsea’s winning run. \nYou need these sort of big results to give a team belief for the long term. And now they have it because Pochettino’s team is maturing fast and growing. \nThe club’s new stadium is taking shape all around the old one. On the pitch the development is going just as quickly. And Pochettino is overseeing it all. poll loading Will Spurs finish in the top four this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:14:41.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
