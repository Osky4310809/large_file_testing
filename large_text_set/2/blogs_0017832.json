Now they’ll be teammates looking to give Washington scoring punch off the bench. (Noah K. Murray/USA Today Sports) In an attempt to bolster bench production on Wednesday afternoon, the Washington Wizards acquired forwards Bojan Bogdanovic and Chris McCullough from the Brooklyn Nets. The Wizards will send Marcus Thornton and Andrew Nicholson, a pair of veteran reserves who had fallen out of the rotation, along with their 2017 first-round draft pick to the Nets. The news was first reported by The Vertical .\nIn Bogdanovic, Washington (34-21, and third in the Eastern Conference) receives a player who can turn into its bonafide second-unit scorer. The 6-foot-8 Bogdanovic has started 54 of the 55 games he has appeared in for the Nets this season, and averaged 14.2 points per game on .440 shooting. Also this year, Bogdanovic has reached 20 or more points 11 times. On Feb. 8 against the Wizards, Bogdanovic scored 21 on 6-of-18 shooting.\nThough the 27-year-old Bogdanovic has proven to be a scoring threat in the NBA, he has been even better in international play. Last summer during the Rio Olympics, Bogdanovic played for Croatia and led all players with a scoring average of 25.3 points through six games.\n[ NBA trade deadline tracker: News, rumors and latest updates ]\nAlthough McCullough, a 6-11 power forward, appears to be more of a project, he has shown progressive steps in his career since recovering from an injury. McCullough played one season at Syracuse before tearing his ACL in Jan. 2015. However later that year, the Nets drafted McCullough in the first round, making him the first New York-born player taken by Brooklyn. McCullough, an athletic big man, has appeared in only 14 games but led Brooklyn in plus/minus (52).\nWith Otto Porter Jr. set to get a huge pay raise this summer, moving Nicholson’s salary from the books for the next three years was part of Washington’s thinking. Since Nicholson signed last summer, he has played his way out of Coach Scott Brooks’s rotation. Nicholson last appeared in a game for longer than 10 minutes on Jan. 14 as Brooks turned to starter Markieff Morris to play minutes at the power forward position with the bench.\nLast summer the Wizards re-signed Thornton to a one-year deal but he too did not live up to the team’s expectations as a second-unit spark plug. Thornton averaged just 6.6 points on .400 shooting and has not played since Jan. 3.\nThis story will be updated.\nMore NBA:\nThe 15-year chain reaction that led to the NBA’s current offensive explosion\nWhy teams were afraid to add Cousins, and 19 more trade-deadline nuggets\nAs John Wall proves he belongs among NBA elite, his eye is on a greater assist", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@CandaceDBuckner", "https://twitter.com/WojVerticalNBA/status/834507291441389570"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:13:13.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
