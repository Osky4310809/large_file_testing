According to online oddsmaker Bovada , St. Pierre is a -130 favorite heading into his 2017 showdown with Bisping. “The Count,” meanwhile, was initially listed at +100. UFC President Dana White announced that St. Pierre would face Bisping for the 185-pound title during an appearance on SportsCenter on Wednesday. That date and venue for their bout are currently unknown. St. Pierre hasn’t competed since taking a split-decision triumph over Johny Hendricks at UFC 167 in November 2013. The 35-year-old Tristar Gym representative has won his last 12 fights in the Octagon. Bisping, 38, has won five straight fights and captured middleweight gold with a first-round knockout of Luke Rockhold at UFC 199. He defended the title with a five-round verdict against Dan Henderson at UFC 204 this past October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:44:47.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
