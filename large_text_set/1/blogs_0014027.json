Despite being a wild cat, Lynx is housebroken and is even trained to use a baby’s bathtub as a toilet. \nSpeaking to RT, Aleksandr explained that, oddly enough, the idea to tame the lynx came to him while he was boar hunting. One of the men who Aleksandr was hunting with that day accidentally shot a lynx, which made the now proud owner of one to feel sympathy towards the deceased feline. \n“I took a look at the dead animal and felt bad about it. I got interested in the animal, so I went to the local fur farm and found out more about these creatures, how they live and I bought one for myself,” he told RT. Read more Here, fluffy!

In May 2016, an investigation by the Press Association revealed that thousands of dangerous wild animals are kept in UK apartments, with over 100 councils having issued special Dangerous Wild Animals (DWA) licenses to owners of predators. Among the exotic animals kept across the UK, are at least 13 tigers, over 300 cobras, two lions, 10 alligators, nine crocodiles and even 15 wolves.

Lyubarsky said he doesn’t see a problem with a lynx residing in his apartment, as it had been properly vaccinated and has an animal passport issued for it. \nEdgard Zapashny, head of Moscow state circus and owner of tiger Martin, told RT that although his pet tiger “grew up a good guy and never attacked us,” Martin is an “abnormality” rather than the rule, as such peaceful behavior is “not normal for a wild animal.” \nREAD MORE: ‘We’ll feed you to the crocodile!’ Italian mafia threaten local businesses with exotic animals \n“The rule is that an animal remains an animal no matter what we make of it,” said Zapashny, who is a renowned tiger tamer, adding that a “good attitude towards them [wild animals] doesn’t guarantee reciprocity.” \nOn the other hand, Iain Newby, an exotic animal keeper from the UK and a longtime head of the Dangerous Animals Rescue Facility, said there was nothing wrong in general with keeping a lynx at home, although perhaps not in this specific case. \n“For if I was going to keep a lynx, it would have a large outside enclosure and it would have all its needs met and cared for. There is no reason why they can’t become tamed, like that one is,” he said. \nAccording to Newby, the main problem – at least in the UK – stems from the fact that “for every 10 people that have a license in England, there are another 90 that have dangerous animals and don’t have a license.” \nHe believes that the negligence on behalf of the unlicensed pet owners should be of a particular concern. \nAside of the debate, it is noteworthy to mention that if a wild animal – especially such as a lion – does attack, there is “little chance to save the person,” Bair Sambatov, a pediatric surgeon and orthopedic traumatologist, told RT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T07:03:51.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
