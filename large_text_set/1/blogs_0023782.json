The movie industry, as it has begun to adapt and take comic book movies more seriously, has followed suit and drawn upon these well established fan-favorite arcs, like Marvel’s Civil War , in the third Captain America film.\nThe animated Marvel universe is about to get into the action as well with their own take on Civil War. Avengers Assemble has been airing on Disney XD for three seasons and the new one is about to delve into a huge multi-episode event.\nThe Avengers Assemble cartoon, which has been dubbed Avengers: Ultron Revolution for season 3, will bring the heroes of the Marvel Universe together for their own socio-policital clash. There will be a big four-part event on Saturday, January 28th on the Disney XD network. The episodes, titled ‘Civil War, Part 1: The Fall of Attilan’, ‘Civil War, Part 2: The Mighty Avengers’, ‘Civil War, Part 3: The Drums of War’ and ‘Civil War, Part 4: Avengers Revolution’ will all air in a row.\nWe’ve already seen a great live-action adaptation of this on the big screen with Captain America: Civil War , but the animated version stands to bring its own unique spin on the popular storyline. There are a lot of limitations that come with live action, including a lack of access to certain characters. Thankfully, the animated series does not have this problem, so you can expect much more of the Marvel Universe to be involved in this feud.\nThe episodes will feature a story that mixes Civil War with Civil War II . An Inhuman will lose control and destroy a small town, leading to the government imposing the Registration Act — which the Avengers disagree with. The arc will pit the Avengers against the Mighty Avengers, who will be called upon to enforce the new law. The Avengers team in the cartoon will depart from the movies and keep Iron Man on the side of Captain America, along with Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk, Thor, and Falcon. The Might Avengers team includes powerhouse players like Captain Marvel, Vision, Black Panter, Ant-Man, Songbird, and even Red Hulk.\nThis is just the latest in a series of obstacles throughout season 3 of Avengers: Ultron Revolution , where they have already clashed with Baron Zemo, the Kree, Egghead, Abomination, HYDRA, and their constant struggle to stay one step ahead of Kang the Conqueror\nCivil War is just the beginning for the popular Avengers cartoon. The Marvel heroes had better duke it out and make up soon, because it was announced at San Diego Comic-Con that next season will explore another fan-favorite event story arc, Secret Wars. This one is of note, as it will bring Hayley Atwell back in her role as Agent Carter from the recently canceled live-action television series.\nNext: Spider-Man’s Tom Holland May Be Filming Avengers: Infinity War Scenes The Avengers: Ultron Revolution four-part Civil War event will air on Saturday, January 28, 2017 on Disney XD.\nSource : Blastr", "external_links": ["http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/civilwar.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://www.blastr.com/2017-1-26/avengers-ultron-revolution-civil-war", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/civilwar.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/civilwar.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/civilwar.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/civilwar.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/civilwar.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/civilwar.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1400&h=700&fit=crop", "http://screenrant1.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/civilwar.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-27T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T11:18:57.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
