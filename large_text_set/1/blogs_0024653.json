If something bounces on it, then it is away,\" Klopp said at a news conference. \n\"Obviously, that happened kind of, but it is not that we play without confidence. I can see a lot of moments when we really still believe in our skills and all that stuff. So we do not have to make it too big. \nKlopp hits 10-year low with Liverpool \n\"It is not that I say there is no chance until Tuesday to make a real turn. Somebody asked me a second ago if this is the lowest point of my Liverpool time until now. I do not know but if it is, it is the perfect point to turn because it is not possible to go lower. That is all we have to think about now. \n\"It is not that hard but it feels in this moment - and is absolutely right - bad. We have to use it. In this moment, it is not the right time to talk too much about being positive and optimistic. No doubt from Sunday on we will be, but in this moment we feel really bad.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T23:11:13.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
