ERNIE PENAREDONDO \nTAGAYTAY, Philippines – Mindanao’s Roel Quitoy rode out his misfortune on a borrowed bike as he romped past overall leader Jan Paul Morales in the sprints to nail his first lap victory in Stage 10 of the LBC Ronda Pilipinas. \nQuitoy who nearly withdrew after his bike broke down e in the Angeles-Subic Stage Three, clocked three hours, 25 minutes and 29 seconds to claim his first ever stage triumph worth P20,000. \n“I won’t be right now if not for sir Paul Tan, who lent me his bike after my bike broke down in Subic,” said the Zamboanga City rider, thanking his main backer.Unlike his heavy mountain bike worth P12,000, Tan’s bike was light thus boosting the reed-thin bike mechanic’s bid, particularly in the climbing stages. \nQuitoy towed a group that included Morales then cut loose with the latter in the ascent in Sampaloc in Batangas to snatch the lap win. \nThe 31-year-old Morales, riding the crest of his Stage Nine criterium romp in Sta. Rosa, Laguna Sunday, had a chance to record his fifth lap win but apparently allowed Quitoy to seize the moment. He settled for second in 33:30:50. \n“He worked hard down in Batangas and was with me in the climb. So he deserved this win,” said Morales of Quitoy. “I hope he gets inspired by this and become an inspiration to the younger riders.”   \nKinetix Lab-Army’s Ronnilan Quita finished third while Navy’s Jay Lampawog wound up fourth with same times of 3:26:50. \nFormer leader Rudy Roque was at No. 5 while Kinetix Lab-Army’s Marvin Tapic and Cris Joven, Navy’s Lloyd Reynante and Joel Calderon and Ilocos Sur’s Jheffson Sotto complete the Top 10 with 3:27:49. \nMorales, already assured of at least P100,000 for his four stage triumphs and a pair of runner-up finishes, firmed up his grip of No. 1 with 33:26:24, 4.26 minutes ahead of Roque, who has 33:30:50. \nJoven moved from No. 5 to No. 3 with 33:34:39 but remained 8.15 minutes off the pace while Lampawog jumped from No. 10 to No. 4 with 33:37:48. \nGo for Gold’s Jonel Carcueva dropped from No. 4 to No. 5 with 33:38:40 while Navy’s Daniel Ven Carino and Quita also barged into the Top 10 for their strong stage efforts, improving to Nos. 9 and 10 with 33:42:51 and 33:45:29, respectively. \nGo for Gold’s Bryant Sepnio (33:39:09), RC Cola-NCR’s Leonel Dimaano (33:39:28) and Ilocos Sur’s Ryan Serapio (33:41:39) were at Nos. 6, 7 and 8. \nWith Morales sustaining his form, Navy also kept its hold of the lead in the team race with a total clocking of 134:59:29, 47.07 minutes ahead of Kinetix Lab-Army with 135:46:37. \nGo for Gold is at No. 3 with 137:14:12. \nThe 19-year-old Lampawog’s fourth place effort yesterday also put him in the lead in the best young rider’s race from Carcueva. \nMorales will continue to wear the red LBC jersey in today’s 140-km race where riders will be flagged off in Calamba, Laguna and will finish in Antipolo City. \nRonda is staking P1 million to the champion courtesy of presentor LBC and in partnership with MVP Sports Foundation, Petron, Mitsubishi, Versa.ph, Partas, Maynilad, Standard Insurance, CCN, Bike Xtreme, NLEX, PhilCycling and 3Q Sports Event Management.
