Messi scores outrageous basket \nThe brilliance of Bellerin, though, may have been overlooked. \nArsenal’s jet-heeled Spaniard is widely regarded as one of the finest full-backs in the Premier League, with his pace and energy having seen him enjoy a meteoric rise over recent years. \nBellerin has, however, been showing during a visit to the latest NBA showpiece in London that he is much more than merely a defender and anything Messi can do, he can do better. — Héctor Bellerín (@HectorBellerin) January 12, 2017 \nHe is rightly applauded for his efforts by those in attendance, with Arsenal team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain left hanging for some time before he gets in on the act.
