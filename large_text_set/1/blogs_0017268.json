But wait , you say. I’ve seen tons of videos of skiers doing cool tricks, and plenty of car commercials. What could possibly be different about this one? Well, have you ever seen a skier speed down grass, dirt, gravel, a tunnel, and even a footbridge, and then fly over a tractor and land a backflip in a field of crops? No. No you haven’t. \nThovex, a 34-year-old freeskiing sensation, has earned a reputation for taking the sport to new terrain. So Audi recruited him to do his thing in a commercial for its Quattro, presumably telling the daredevil that he could do whatever the hell he wanted so long as he landed in the open trunk of an Audi. After the Quattro clip became a viral hit , haters naturally said it was fake, prompting Thovex to unveil this behind-the-scenes footage from the shoot. Thovex’s stunts are decidedly not fake, haters, so please go try to ski without snow and see what happens before questioning the man’s craft.
