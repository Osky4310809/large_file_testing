The recession may have buttomed out with the improving trends in several key sectors of the economy, including agriculture and mining, Dipeolu said. \nHe said with the ongoing engagement of the oil-producing communities of the Niger Delta, the Buhari administration is hopeful that increased oil production output would be sustained. \nHe said the ongoing implementation of the Social Investment Programmes, and a possible early legislative passage of the 2017 budget, are expected to spur a positive multiplier effect on the Nigerian economy. \nThe Buhari administration, he said, will not relent in its determined effort and it’s comprehensive approach to bring about the full recovery of the Nigerian economy and set it on a solid path of sustainable growth. \nHe said: “The recently released data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by -1.30% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This translated into an estimated growth rate of -1.51% for the full year 2016. These figures reflect the slow-down in the economy for most of 2016 but also show that the recession may have bottomed out because of an improving trend in several key sectors. \n“Although the oil sector declined by -12.38% on a year on year basis, this was a relative improvement compared to the third quarter when the decline amounted to -22.01%. This outcome was due mainly to increases in production such that the quarter on quarter growth for the oil sector between the third and fourth quarters was 8.07%. \n“The non-oil sector however declined by 0.33% after showing some resilience in the third quarter when it grew by 0.03% at the height of the recession. \n“Agriculture grew at 4.03% in the fourth quarter of 2016 which was a marginal decrease from the 4.54% growth in the third quarter. This is mainly because agriculture (especially crop production, which accounts for the bulk of agricultural production) is highly seasonal, with growth in the third quarter of the year usually higher than the others. Nevertheless, the overall outcome for the year was that the agricultural sector grew by 4.11% for the whole of 2016 which was higher than the figure of 3.72% for 2015.” he added \nHe also said that the manufacturing sector actually grew on a quarter on quarter basis by 1.89% but declined over the year by 4.32% reflecting the problems that the sector faced in the course of the year due to a combination of factors including the depreciation in the exchange rate and higher energy costs. \nThe metal ores sub-sector, he said, grew by 7.03% in Q4 of 2016 as compared to 6.93% in the last quarter of 2015, justifying the priority that the Federal Government continues to give to solid minerals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:28:08.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
