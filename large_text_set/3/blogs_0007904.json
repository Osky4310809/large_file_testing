Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFootballer’s wife Rebekah Vardy has become embroiled in a social media row after criticising the attitude of some doctors’ surgery receptionists. \nThe outspoken WAG, who is married to Leicester City player Jamie Vardy, posted a disgruntled tweet to her 32,000 followers about the way she felt she’d been treated during an encounter with a GP surgery. \nRebekah, 34, said: “Why are receptionists at doctors surgeries so stuck up and rude! (sic)” \nWhile some users agreed with Rebekah, not everyone was impressed with the mum of four’s tweet; one fellow user was quick to reply: “I am a GP receptionist and am definitely not rude or stuck up, should we stereotype all footballers wives as well!!!” Rebekah Vardy posted her thoughts to Twitter (Photo: Rebekah Vardy/Instagram) \nRebekah responded: “If you want to love! I’m speaking from my own personal experience and I’ve not come across a pleasant one yet!” \nPlenty of fellow users then chipped in to either agree or disagree with Rebekah’s post, sharing their own experiences of doctors’ receptionists. \nOne told her: “I think that's a very unfair generalisation tbh.” \nAnother countered: “I'm a doctors receptionist and am always polite and helpful to our patients. There are good and bad in every profession.” \nA third said: \" I agree with Rebekah! Apparently receptionists can diagnose conditions too!\" \nAnd a fourth added: \"That is too true, some things are personal and you don't want to tell anybody let alone a receptionist.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T11:24:41.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
