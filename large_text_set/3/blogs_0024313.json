The play in question involved WVU's Nathan Adrian saving the ball from going out of bounds. Originally, the refs ruled that he stepped out, which would give WVU the ball. \nBut after a looong time reviewing it, six minutes and 47 seconds to be exact, the refs finally reversed the call. In the video above, NCAA Tournament announcer Chris Webber was not happy throughout the review, and openly criticized the refs for taking such a long time — a criticism that, to be honest, was pretty warranted. \nThe call going in the Mountaineers’ favor turned out well, as WVU hit a three-pointer on the next possession. \nWe’ll see if we get more from Webber on this call and its long review. \nDo better, refs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:39:31.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
