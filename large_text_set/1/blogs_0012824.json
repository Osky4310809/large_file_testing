That’s the work we do.” She added, “I think it’s important to understand, it’s not only that they want to end access to Planned Parenthood, they want to end access to care for a lot of folks in this country. And I believe it’s going to cause a healthcare crisis.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:21:39.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
