In fact, the supermodel's come up with so many ideas for mixing and matching her bikinis , we can barely keep up. But while vacationing with her friends Bella Hadid, Elsa Hosk, Hannah Ferguson, Lais Ribeiro, Hailey Baldwin, and Rose Bertram in the Bahamas, Emily pulled a style switch-up. \nHer red Solid & Striped design was fitted and sleek, with not a cutout in sight, and the plunging neckline was a touch sexy — very simple, very effortless, very Baywatch . Emily completed her look with a dainty chain necklace , allowing us full focus on her one-piece. While clearly, most of her pals prefer classic tops and bottoms, Emily is making a case for coverage at the beach. Read on for a look, then shop similar silhouettes for yourself.
