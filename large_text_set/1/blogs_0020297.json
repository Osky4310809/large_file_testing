National Grid recently won permission from state regulators to increase gas bills citywide to pay for its portion of the cleanup . \nLoney downplayed fears over reports that Trump ordered the EPA to halt grant and contract awards and cease communicating with the public. She said those moves \"aren't unheard of\" when a new administration takes the reins, and that the freeze on contracts and grants wouldn't affect the Gowanus cleanup. \n\"We're not tweeting, we're not engaging in any kind of policy conversations, \" Loney said, adding that she's still free to talk about the \"nuts and bolts\" of the cleanup with the public. \nShe added: \"For many of us here, this is new territory, the change in administration, but this is something that the agency and many agencies go through on a semi-regular basis, so we’re pretty comfortable with it.\" \nThe 1.4-mile Gowanus Canal was named a Superfund site in 2011, meaning that the EPA will oversee a cleanup of the heavily polluted waterway, which was used as a dumping ground by nearby industrial businesses for more than a century. The Superfund cleanup will take several years. It started with debris removal late last year and isn't expected to be finished until at least 2022.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T05:46:49.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
