(Photo: The CW /Warner Bros. TV) \nIn \"Luthors,\" fans got their first look at the \"secret origin\" of Lena Luthor, in which a young Lex is playing chess with his mother when Lena comes in to officially join the family. \nWhat's doubly interesting is his position behind a chess board...something that we had seen Lillian Luthor doing in a teaser for the episode and had previously speculated that Checkmate might play a role in upcoming episodes. \nSince Checkmate has a chess theme, its highest-ranking members are Kings and Queens -- but major players have been knights and rooks in both the comics and in other media -- including a white knight named Tess Mercer in Smallville . \nFor those who don't know, Mercer was later revealed to have secretly been a Luthor all along. In an episode titled \"Luthors,\" then, that's a conspicuous prop for the matriarch of the Luthor family to be playing with... \n...especially in the episode where we learn something very significant about Lena Luthor's parentage.
