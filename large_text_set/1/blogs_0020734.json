What am I doing with my life?” \nYour body fills with panic. Your mouth feels dry. You feel like a loser who is destined to die alone. \nGirl, I’m telling you, stop that shit right now. Change that dialogue that’s replaying in your head and ponder the opposite! \nBut hey, I get it . The world can feel like an alienating place for single creatures. So when you’re sitting around sulking and getting sad about basic Suzy Q and her basic white wedding dress, I want you to click the fuck out of Suzy Q’s Instagram. \nIn fact, click out of Instagram completely. All it is is a stupid highlight reel of people’s boring lives. \nGo on Twitter instead. It’s much more raw and honest. “ #ReasonsIAintInARealtionship ” is trending on Twitter and it’s providing some GREAT insight about why being single is the best. \nSeriously, these tweets will make you HAPPY to be SINGLE AS A DOLLAR BILL, honey! You have very high standards… \n— sara/PROUD OF LOUIS (@StyPayHorSon221) January 23, 2017 #ReasonsIAintInARelationship I play hard to get, when nobody is trying to get me pic.twitter.com/ZeJLNlD3fP \nI always say the more smart and fabulous you are, the harder it is to meet someone who is your match. You have far more important work to do. #ReasonsIAintInARelationship cause I'm searching 4 all these ppl Trump claims was at his inauguration #mondaymotivation pic.twitter.com/hmKMUVS7an \n— PeTeY WHEatStRaW (@ItIzDanaDane) January 23, 2017 \nYou can’t be in a relationship when you have this kind of workload, babes. It’s a full-time job. You’re married to your art. \n— James Bakian (@JamesBakian) January 23, 2017 \nYou’re already in a deep, committed relationship with your ART. It’s more fun to complain about being single than it is to date. \n— Mariam Guasch (@MariamGuasch) January 23, 2017 She told me I'm sweet and a gentleman and she wish she could meet a guy like me. \nBut I am a guy like me #ReasonsIAintInARelationship pic.twitter.com/d8OhO1685L \n— IG: i_thabanii (@i_thabanii) January 23, 2017 \nIt’s so much fun to salaciously BITCH about your singleness than it is to go on dates with boring, basic people. You would rather eat than have terrible sex.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:20:31.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
