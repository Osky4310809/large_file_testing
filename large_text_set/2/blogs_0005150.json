Photo credit: Andy Clayton-King/ AP \nThe Minnesota Legislative Auditor has released an extensive special report on the use of luxury suites at the publicly funded Minnesota Vikings stadium by commissioners of the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority, finding that commissioners “violated a core ethical principle” when they gave free tickets to friends and family and the Authority “failed to comply with state law by not maintaining a record of who received tickets to its stadium suites.” The Legislative Auditor recommended the “enactment of laws to control the use of complimentary tickets at all sports and entertainment facilities built with public money.” \nBack in November, we aggregated the Minneapolis Star Tribune ’s excellent reporting , that revealed Authority members and the executive director controlled two luxury suites at the Minnesota Vikings’ recently completed stadium, as well as free food and sometimes free parking, ostensibly to use for “marketing purposes.” Equivalent luxury suites sold for between $200,000 and $300,000.

But they did “violate a core ethical principle,” as well as failing to heed “this common ethical guidance” of avoiding ethical impropriety, or even the perception of impropriety. \nThese findings led to four recommendations from the Legislative Auditor: The Legislature should enact a law to control the Authority’s use of complimentary tickets to events at the U.S. Bank Stadium. The Legislature should consider enacting a law that would allow one or both of the Authority’s suites at the [Vikings stadium] to be used for nonprofit charitable purposes. The Legislature should exercise more oversight of the Authority. The Legislature should consider enactment of laws to control the use of complimentary tickets at all sports and entertainment facilities built with public money. \nThe Star Tribune reports that a state legislator will soon introduce a bill to “expand the ban on gifts for public officials to prohibit individuals or private associations from giving preferential admission for events held in publicly owned facilities.” Recommended Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T19:58:51.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
