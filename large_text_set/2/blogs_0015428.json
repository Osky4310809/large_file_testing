Watch our video of the protest below: JUSTIN TALLIS via Getty Images JUSTIN TALLIS via Getty Images \nA Facebook group for the event had some 16,000 people listed as attending. Organisers have yet to give an estimate on the numbers there. \nTrump’s planned state visit has been controversial. Earlier this month, Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, stunned Westminster with a speech attacking a “racist, sexist” Trump and a pledge to bar the president from speaking in parliament’s Westminster Hall. \nMore recently, there have been suggestions Trump’s visit will take in a campaign-style rally at London’s Olympic village. \nMany of those attending Monday evening’s event told The Huffington Post UK they travelled for hours to protest Trump and the UK’s apparent appeasement of his brand of politics. \"We say sack Theresa May,\" crowd chants at Parliament Square @UKStopTrump rally #TrumpDebate pic.twitter.com/mD72L4IgY2 — George Bowden (@georgebowden) February 20, 2017 \nLabour’s Diane Abbott addressed the protest and continued despite an altercation near the front of the stage as she spoke.
