Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nApple gave developers their first look at the next big update for iOS 10 yesterday and it packs a surprising number of new features. \nThe public will have to wait a few weeks (or months) to get their hands on the new goodies packed inside iOS 10.3 that brings improvements for AirPods, iPads and more. \nHere are all the new additions: Apple ID Profile \nThe Settings app now has a new profile section that lets you access you Apple ID profile information.The page shows all the Apple devices you’ve used to sign in. It also displays the iPhone owner’s contact info, security settings, iCloud, App Store settings, payment information and more. Find My AirPods \nKeeping track of Apple’s tiny AirPods is now as easy as pulling up the Find My iPhone app. AirPod owners can use the feature to make the earbuds blast a loud sound so can hunt them down. The feature only works from the last iPhone or iPad that was connected to the AirPods. iCloud calls for Verizon \niPhone subscribers on Verizon can now make and answer calls from any iCloud connected device. The feature was already supported by AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. Once enabled, you can accept a call on their Macs, iPads, iPods, or Apple Watch, even if your iPhone isn’t nearby. One-handed iPad keyboard \nhttps://twitter.com/i/web/status/824004549564317702 \nHidden among the new code, Apple secretly added a third keyboard option for iPad that makes it easier to type one hand. The one-handed keyboard looks like an iPhone keyboard. You can move the keyboard screen around on the iPad like a picture-in-picture screen. iCloud Storage \nYou can now see how much iCloud storage you’re using by visiting the iCloud settings page. The new section gives users a graphical breakdown of how much storage is being used and by what type of files. Podcast Widget \nYou can now add a widget for Podcasts to Spotlight search screen. CarPlay \nSome small changes were made to the UI of CarPlay. There are now 3 icons on the left side display the most recently used apps. The Maps app also now displays EV charging stations. Apple File System \niOS 10.3 switches iPhone and iPad users to the Apple File System that provides stronger encryption and is optimized for NAND flash storage. Transition changes \nApple made a very tiny tweak to the transition animation between apps. Apps now have more rounded edges when they open and close. Weather in Maps \niPhone users with a 3D Touch device can now hard press on the new weather icon in the Maps app to view weather forecasts for a specific area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:59:37.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
