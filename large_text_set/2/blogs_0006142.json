Enlarge Image USPTO \nOther smart contact lenses are focused on improving vision or providing an augmented reality HUD , but Sony wants to look outwards rather than in. A new patent, awarded to the company in April, describes a contact lens that can be controlled by the user's deliberate blinks, recording video on request. \nSensors embedded in the lens are able to detect the difference between voluntary and involuntary blinks. The image capture and storage technology would all be embedded in the lens around the iris, and piezoelectric sensors would convert the movements of the eye into energy to power the lens. \nOf course, at this point, this technology isn't small enough to be comfortably embedded in a contact lens, so it's only theoretical. However, with Google seemingly pursuing a contact lens camera after Glass failed so spectacularly, it's not surprising that other tech giants are getting on board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:44:05.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
