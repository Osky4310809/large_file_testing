It unfurled. \nYou have two types of nose hair , and one is sneakier than the other. Type I—the one you know about—stands straight and proud. He willingly submits himself to the periodic threshing of that ten-dollar blade. He probably wouldn’t venture outside your nose even if you let him grow. \nType II is on a mission of surprise. He wants to disgust the romantic targets that thought you were “30ish.” Type II flattens himself against the inside rim known as the alar-nostril sill. Type II avoids the blade the way Keanu dodged bullets in The Matrix . (As I said, I’m over 30.) \nWhen you least expect it, a solo Type II hair will unfurl like a puma unfolding itself from a rocky ledge to go in search of prey. What’s a man to do? There’s only one way to be completely sure you’ve tracked down Type II nose hairs. It’s called nostril waxing, and please don’t be fooled into thinking this is painless. Exhibit A: A post shared by Sweet Escape Spa Patterson Ca (@sweetescapespa209) on Oct 12, 2016 at 1:23pm PDT \nThe simplest way to describe it is: It feels like all your nose hair being torn out at once . \nSo let’s not give up on trimming; instead, just nail down the right tool and technique . \nA great go-to weapon: the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Wet/Dry Nose & Ear Hair Trimmer ($10, amazon.com ) . You can actually run water through it to rinse it out, which gives you the satisfaction of viewing the terrible crop you’ve harvested. Another great pick is the ear and nose attachment on the powerful Wahl Lithium Ion Stainless Steel Groomer ($60, amazon.com ) . \nThe technique: T.R.I.M.—Twist. Rotate. Inspect. Maneuver. Start by using one hand to twist your nose right and left to get a peek inside. Just the change in vantage will reveal hidden culprits. \nThen trim gently, keeping the trimmer in constant rotation around the inner edge of each nostril. These trimmers aren’t made to do much while standing still. It’s the motion that brings them into contact with hair. \nInspect. Tilt your head back and look down your nose. Tweak the tip of your nose to see into those two deep caves at the tip. Re-trim as needed. \nFinally, maneuver the un-gettable hairs into a better position. Use a balled up stub of tissue to towel off the inside of each nostril. Then, use a similar stub to poke inward, herding any strays upward instead of outward. I mean it. You’re a busy man—if you can’t get ‘em out, push ‘em back in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:09:01.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
