Advertisement \nAt the helm of edX is Anant Agarwal , who is also a professor of electrical engineering at MIT. He’s been a longtime advocate of MOOCs (massive open online courses) that enable thousands of people to participate in courses from universities ranging from Harvard to Berkeley and even schools abroad. He’s also co-founded several companies and continues to travel the world while helming edX. But, as we learned, his favorite work spot isn’t a glossy office; it’s a humble greasy spoon diner. Here’s how he works. \nLocation: Cambridge, MA Current Gig: CEO of edX, Professor at MIT One word that best describes how you work: Obsessively Current mobile device: My most mobile device is my ballpoint pen, but I supplement that with an iPhone 7 and a mini iPad. Current computer: Samsung 900X Windows notebook What apps, software, or tools can’t you live without? Why? \nI travel pretty frequently (or dare I say constantly?). With over 100 global edX partners, it’s not uncommon for me to be in Miami one week and Mumbai the next, so I rely on my iPhone hotspot to stay connected no matter where I am in the world. I also use my my Gmail app, Google Drive, and remote desktop a lot, too. It’s not all work when I travel, though—I can’t live without my flashlight and magnifier app, since I need both to expand the print on menus when dining out! I’m also a fan of the Slingbox app—I use it to watch the Patriots play when I’m traveling. What’s your workspace setup like? \nOutside of my office in the edX HQ in Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts, my most important office is a diner called Frescafe in Natick, right down the road from the town where my family and I live. On the weekends, I spend at least two hours a day in the place—just me, my laptop and many cups of decaf coffee. The greasy breakfast joint has been my haunt for twenty years—I wrote my co-authored textbook on electronic circuits there in the early 2000’s and they haven’t been able to get rid of me since! I’ve also been known to strike up conversations with fellow diners and wait staff. On numerous occasions, the edX sticker on my laptop has been a conversation starter and I’ve had the pleasure of hearing stories from edX learners who happened to visit or work at the diner. There’s no better motivation to really crack on with a difficult proposal or review a long deck than hearing inspiring stories from real-life edX learners. What’s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack? \nThat’s easy! Procrastinate. When it comes to work, my life hack is ‘if it can be postponed then postpone it.’ Even though I know it’s not the most perfect way to go about managing my time, it works for me. It probably also makes my colleagues mad at me! Sometimes I find that the work was unnecessary and can avoid it altogether, but usually what happens is that I end up having far too many things to do close to a deadline, so I have to prioritize and be super efficient and minimize the time I spend on things, while maximizing the thoughtfulness and energy I put into them. Can I caveat this answer by saying that if there’s one thing I’d like to do better, it would be time management? What’s your favorite to-do list manager? \nThe piece of paper I have currently crumpled up in my pocket. It’s not high-tech, it is super portable, never runs out of charge, works on airplanes, but you better believe that if I add a task to this scrap of paper, then it will get done! Besides your phone and computer, what gadget can’t you live without and why? \nDuring conference calls or meetings, I can’t live without an analog desk clock in clear view. I tend to love deep diving into rabbit holes during conversations and can lose track of time. I don’t wear a watch, and prefer not to have my phone or laptop or any other device out to distract me during meetings, so my usual sources of time are unavailable. So, an analog clock keeps me on track, as I can keep my eye on how much time I’ve spent talking without opening my phone or laptop. What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What’s your secret? \nMaking Kerala fish curry. Mine is unparalleled!   \nAlso, I used to do stand up comedy in school, and I think being funny and being able to find the humor in things is critical to being a good leader. You can disarm people with humor even if they are going to be unhappy with a decision. What do you listen to while you work? Got a favorite playlist? Maybe talk radio? Or do you prefer silence? \nI listen to talk radio when I drive and am not on the phone. But, having grown accustomed to a VERY noisy dorm at IIT Madras during my undergrad years, I can work practically anywhere. These days, I can still shut out the noisy background of the world while working. Once, I even missed my Air Canada flight as I sat hammering away on the keys of my laptop opposite the boarding gate even as they called out my name several times. To avoid this, I now set the alarm on my mobile phone! What are you currently reading? Or what’s something you’d recommend? \nProbably something by John Grisham. How do you recharge? What do you do when you want to forget about work? \nI think about working out and that tires me, but I really need to start exercising. A greasy breakfast at a diner or going out for pizza is always fun. I also turn to Netflix, when I need to escape into a movie. What’s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early-riser? \nI can sleep very easily at any time. I can, in all honesty, sleep standing up. I try to get six to seven hours of sleep a day. Sponsored \nI am absolutely a night owl and I love to work late into the night. I despise the early morning! I’d much rather stay up all night to make a 5am meeting than face a 5am wake up call.
