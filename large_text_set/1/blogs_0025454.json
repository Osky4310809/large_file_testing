Expand Photo: Getty Images \nEven though she recently took a three-month break from her cellphone, Selena Gomez is back to sharing her private life on social media—well, sort of. The 24-year-old singer, who has recently been linked to The Weeknd , posted a short video clip of her rumored new love on Instagram during a recent weekend trip in Italy. The clip was posted after the two had been spotted all around Florence and Venice this past weekend and features The Weeknd in a hoodie, riding a boat in Venice, along with a heart-eyed emoji caption, which, in typical emoji fashion, spoke louder than any words. \nBut the very public declaration of affection was quickly taken down just a few hours later. Perhaps the notoriously press-shy Weeknd was uncomfortable with all the attention? Or maybe it was just meant to go up as an Insta story and not a permanent post? Who knows, but it certainly seems like these two are more than just friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T18:22:52.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
