The below picture is from their Instagram feed: Despite the Barnsley youngster catching the eye of some major Premier League players, Bree has chosen Aston Villa as is playing destination. It’s likely that Bree will replace Alan Hutton at right-back for Villa, but don’t be surprised if Bruce refuses to rush him in. Here’s some stats from our earlier piece on Bree: Across his career, James Bree has made over 30 appearances in League One and the Championship for Barnsley and has played 17 games at right-back thus far in this season’s competition. Bree has also contributed two assists to a surging Barnsley team that occupy eight place in the table right now. Interestingly enough, James Bree hasn’t collected a single booking this season . In fact, across his 58 appearances for Barnsley in all competitions, he has only collected one yellow card. This may suggest he is less prone to desperate challenges, much unlike Villa’s current duo of Alan Hutton and Micah Richards. The other side of this is that he may be reluctant to put it all on the line for the team. One does have to feel sympathy for Barnsley. The talent they have produced in the past number of years is incredible and ideally, they will be able to build a future for the club with the money they have received.
