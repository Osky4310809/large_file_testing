Haspel has 30 years of CIA experience under her belt, both in the U.S. and outside the borders. She is now the first CIA career female to be appointed to this position, and second woman overall. \nSenior intelligence officials gave her appointment a warm welcome. Many are hoping that this appointment will mend the rigidity between President Trump and the intelligence community. \nThe CIA detailed her qualifications and experience. In Washington, she has held numerous senior leadership positions at CIA, including as Deputy Director of the National Clandestine Service, Deputy Director of the National Clandestine Service for Foreign Intelligence and Covert Action, Chief of Staff for the Director of the National Clandestine Service, and in the Counterterrorist Center. \nIt is hoped that the appointment will ease the tensions of intelligence officials that stemmed from the choice of Pompeo. Haspel, unlike Pompeo, boasts immense experience. . \nJames Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, released a statement Thursday applauding Trump's choice. I am very pleased to learn of Director Pompeoâ€™s selection of Gina Haspel as Deputy Director. It speaks well of him for picking a seasoned veteran of the Agency who is widely and deeply respected by the workforce as well as those outside the Agency. She has the broad-gauged experience from both foreign and domestic assignments to serve as the right-arm for Director Pompeo. I am particularly gratified, since she has also been a strong proponent for integration, not only within CIA, but across the Intelligence Community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:01:41.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
