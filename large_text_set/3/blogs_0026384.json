Philippine Navy, file MANILA, Philippines â€” The Senate Committee on Economic Affairs will hold a hearing on Wednesday on defense and security concerns in Benham Rise, its chairman said. In a statement on the Senate website, Sen. Sherwin \"Win\" Gatchalian said the hearing will be a continuation of a March 7 hearing on a bill filed by Sen. Juan Edgardo \"Sonny\" Angara to create a Benham Rise Development Authority. \"We have found it prudent to conduct another hearing in order to paint a clearer picture of the facts as we explore long-term strategies to uphold and defend our sovereign rights over the Benham Rise,\" Gatchalian said. Benham Rise, which is part of the Philippines' extended continental shelf, has been in the news of late after Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana disclosed that a Chinese ship was spotted loitering in the area for three months last year. China has said it respects Philippine sovereign rights over the area and that its ships only pass through. President Rodrigo Duterte has also said China let him know in advance that it would be sending ships. A Philippine Navy ship has been sent to patrol the area east of Luzon. Gatchalian said representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of National Defense will be invited to the hearing to discuss what some consider Chinese incursions. Foreign-flagged ships have the right of innocent passage through the waters above Benham Rise but the Philippines has sovereign rights over resources there. \"The primary purpose of this hearing will be to craft a cohesive executive-legislative strategy for the long-term defense and development of the Benham Rise. If the political opposition is expecting a political fault-finding mission, then they will surely be disappointed,\" Gatchalian, a member of the Senate majority, said.
