An app sold for $0.99 in the US will now cost £0.99 in the UK, up from £0.79. \nThat is an increase of about 25% and similar rises will be seen at every price tier when the changes hit the App Store in the coming days. A Tier 2 priced app now costs £1.99 in the UK up from £1.49. An In-App Purchase that previously cost £7.99 will now be priced at £9.99, like the ‘All Worlds’ upgrade for Super Mario Run . \nIncreases of about 25% are reflected all the way across the pricing matrix for the United Kingdom App Store. \nThe weakened pound sterling exchange rate combined with UK’s 20% VAT rate means that app prices have now reached parity with the United States numbers; a $9.99 app now costs £9.99, for example. The cheapest app or in-app purchase in the UK will now be £0.49 … if developers opt to use the alternative price tiers. \nApple is notifying developers today with specific reference to the iOS and Mac App Store but it is likely that the same increases will also hit the iTunes Store for TV shows, movies and books. In addition to the United Kingdom, prices are rising in Turkey and India. \nApple says that the new higher prices will roll out to the App Store over the next seven days. Developers can find out more information about how the price changes affect their revenues in the official documentation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T15:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T11:05:27.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
