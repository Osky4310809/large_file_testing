However, the carrier admits there are still “thousands” of its customers still using the phone, so many that Verizon is now planning even more drastic action to get them to turn in the recalled device.\nSee also: How to return a Galaxy Note 7 bought second-hand October 13, 2016 According to Fortune , a Verizon spokesperson said there are still people who are hanging onto the Note 7 “in spite of our best efforts” to issue warnings and updates to make the phone unusable. The spokesperson added, “The recalled Note 7s pose a safety risk to our customers and those around them.”\nThe carrier says it won’t allow those remaining customers to make any outgoing calls on the Note 7 to any number, except to 911 or to Verizon’s customer service numbers. It also says it may make those customers pay the full retail price for the phone. Verizon is still allowing the Note 7 holdouts a way to turn in their phone, in exchange for ditching its normal upgrade fee as well as adding a bill credit up to $100. But that grace period is coming to an end.\nSamsung officially recalled the Galaxy Note 7 in October after a number of the handsets exploded, causing damages to homes, cars and more. Unconfirmed reports claim Samsung has put the the blame on the phone’s battery and that the company will officially reveal its findings sometime in January .\nDo you know anyone still using a Galaxy Note 7?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:28:51.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
