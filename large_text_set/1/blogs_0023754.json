Do not drain. Stir in garlic, ginger, and soy sauce. Add cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, and stir for a few minutes until softened. Remove from heat, stir in sesame oil, and top with green onions. Note: I used my Spiralizer Vegetable Slicer to slice the cabbage, which made it easy. You could also shred using a cheese grater or knife to thinly chop if desired. To make the recipe even faster, you could also substitute with prepackaged coleslaw mix.\nWe loved how this Egg Roll in a Bowl tasted and how easy it is to prepare as a one pan stir fry meal! You can easily add and subtract ingredients to taste. Next time I may add an egg or two! Overall, this is a must try idea!\nWritten by Lina for Hip2Save.
