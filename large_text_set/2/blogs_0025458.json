Tottenham Hotspur Lineups and Stats \n\"Dele will learn from this,'' Kane said. \"Obviously in European football when tackles like that go in you are more likely to get a red card. \n\"He is obviously gutted and feels like he has let us down a bit, but Dele has been great for us this season. We fought hard for him to turn it around. \n\"It is something he will learn from and get experience from for the future.'' \nAlli's tackle was high and dangerous, spearing his studs just below Dejaegere's knee, but the Belgian felt no bitterness after the match. \n\"Dele Alli just said sorry to me and that's nice from him, he's a professional,'' Dejaegere said. \n\"We're okay, it's football. I saw the images and it could have been much worse. I don't think he meant it because he came to apologise himself.'' \nDejaegere was able to continue initially but had to be substituted in the 56th minute when the pain in his knee became more acute. \n\"The red card made a big difference,'' Dejaegere said. \"Even with 10 they found a free man but with 11 they would have had even one more. \n\"I think it also made a difference in the heads of the players.'' Dele Alli was shown a straight red card for his tackle on Gent's Brecht Dejaegere. \nChristian Eriksen's opener and an own-goal from Kane meant the game hung in the balance when Alli was given his marching orders by referee Manuel De Sousa. \nVictor Wanyama's superb second-half strike gave Tottenham hope, but Jeremy Perbet's late goal on the break sealed Gent passage to the last-16 of the second-tier European competition. \nAlli had cut a frustrated figure in the first half and his challenge appeared an expression of anger, after he had been denied a free kick moments before. \nTottenham are now realistically relying solely on the FA Cup for silverware this season, but to lift the trophy they will have to beat Millwall and then win two matches at Wembley. \nSpurs have now won only once there in eight games and the suspicion remains that any home advantage is outweighed by the inspiration opponents feel from playing at the national stadium. \n\"Six years ago I came to Wembley on a guided tour,'' Dejaegere said. \"I was not allowed on the pitch, there was a sign, 'don't enter the grass on the pitch.' \n\"It's fantastic, like the Mecca of all stadiums, so it gives you something extra. And if you see how many people were here from Gent it gave us something extra. \n\"But also maybe they always lose their games here so it can get in the heads of the players. Maybe they just need one big victory here which could change everything.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:53:21.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
