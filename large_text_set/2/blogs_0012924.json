In addition to receiving training for their work outside prison walls, inmates are paid $2 a day.\n“Even though they do predominantly fire-fighting duty in the summer months, most of the time these are crews out doing conservation work at other times of the year, and they respond whenever Cal Fire or, in this case, the Department of Water Resources, ask for our help,” California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesman Bill Sessa said.\nSessa said inmates trained to work on fire lines have experience needed at Oroville, like clearing out dead tree limbs and brush.\n“We go day-by-day based on whether or not Cal Fire asks for help,” Sessa said. “If we’re asked for help, we do, and if they do not need us, the crews go off and work on other projects.”\nOn Tuesday, Feb. 7, a crater opened on the dam’s main spillway, forcing dam managers first to shut it down for assessment and then allow only limited releases down the damaged concrete chute. Meantime, Lake Oroville, the giant reservoir behind the dam, rose rapidly as runoff from last week’s major storm flowed in. \nEarly last Saturday, the lake level crested more than a foot above never-before-used emergency spillway structure, and the resulting erosion on the hillside below prompted officials to issue an emergency evacuation order for those living downstream. At the same time, managers increase flows down the damaged main spillway. That strategy has proved successful in lowering the lake, which on Friday afternoon was 42 feet below the emergency spillway.\n\nKQED’s Don Clyde contributed to this post.
