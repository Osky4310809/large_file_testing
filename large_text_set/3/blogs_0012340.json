As many as 10,000 men—9,000 Filipinos and 1,000 Americans—perished in the march while many more died at prison camps. \nThe BMDM is considered to be the largest commemoration outside the Philippines. The annual event at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in New Mexico has drawn more than 72,000 people since it started 28 years ago and has grown to include a slate of different races with military and civilian divisions. A record 7,000 marchers from all over the United States are expected this year. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe Filipino Veterans Recognition and Education Project (FilVetREP), headed by Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba (Ret), will lead the Filipino American participation in the Bataan Memorial Death March (BMDM) on Sunday, March 19, 2017. \n“We are marching to honor the soldiers of the greatest generation,” Taguba says. “The story of Filipino and American soldiers gallantly fighting together in Bataan during the Second World War must always be remembered and shared. This auspicious occasion allows us to pay tribute to their service and sacrifice.” \nCelebrating the Congressional Gold Medal \nAdding a special significance to the memorial march is another historic milestone: the recent granting of the Congressional Gold Medal to Filipino and American World War II veterans. Signed into law by President Obama on December 14, 2016, the Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2015 (Public Law 115-265) recognizes their service from July 1941 to December 1946. \n“The Congressional Gold Medal and what it represents provides an opportunity for the thousands of participants to learn more about our soldiers’ wartime service in World War II, their outstanding contributions and achievements, and their personal stories of heroism and uncommon valor,” adds Taguba. \nThe major events taking place this weekend are: \nFriday, March 17 Survivor Descendant Welcome Reception, 3:00 – 5:00 PM \nWSMR Frontier Club Movie: “The Great Raid,” WSMR Post Theater \nSaturday, March 18, 11:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m. FilVetREP presentation on the Congressional Gold Medal (CGM), including a video documentary, “Duty to Country,” and discussion about the project.
