So what did he do? Vikram launched an organization that trains people in cognitive behavioral techniques. After a three week workshop, the trainees go out to their community to help those suffering from depression, alcoholism, and other disorders. In short, Vikram creates lay counselors. And two recent studies show his efforts are working. \nThis problem Vikram addresses–a lack of accessible mental health care–is not limited to India, nor does it exclude our children. Here’s the scary truth: A World Health Organization report predicts that by 2030 depression will be the leading cause disease burden worldwide. \nWhile I believe deeply in the value of professional therapy, I know it will take much more for us to effectively combat the trend of mental health disorders and high stress in this next generation. We need more of us (parents, teachers, caring individuals) to learn research-based skills of well-being and pass them onto others, especially our children. \nTo this end, GoZen! is launching several initiatives, the first of which is called Paper Napkin Mental Health. Every week we’ll be putting out a simple mental health challenge that can be completed with nothing more than a paper napkin and a pen. For those of you who dig the science, we’ll also include the research to back up the technique. What we ask from you is to teach the technique to one other person and then ask them to do the same. Let’s see if we can ignite a contagion of well-being. \nPaper Napkin Mental Health Challenge #1 \nWhat? Identify and apply your strengths when solving a problem. How? Trace your hand on a napkin or piece of paper. Write down five of your greatest strengths-one on each finger. If you’re helping your kids, you can ask them what their greatest strengths are and help them write them out. Optional Bonus: Write the strengths on your real hand! \nThen what? Next time you face an adversity, pick a finger. Use your strength to begin resolving your problem. \nThe challenge! Do this yourself and then teach one other person. When you’re done, ask them to do the same. \nThe science in a nutshell: The research is clear: identifying and applying character strengths increases life satisfaction, well-being, and even academic performance. Here are over 150 research findings. \n\nHave an anxious child? Join us at GoZen! to learn research-based skills to help your kids kick anxiety to the curb!
