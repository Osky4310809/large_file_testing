It has made it easier for many of us to meet new people, and brought dating out in the open. For those of us who aren't looking for a relationship but want some sexy time, online dating apps have created ample opportunity. They have also helped in making sex less of a taboo. But, like anything else, the world of online dating isn't all violins and roses. While we're in favour of it, there are plenty of horror stories out there. So, we thought we'd bring some to you, just to show you the not-so-pretty side of trying to find love (or lust) on the Internet. The one who took me for a family brunch...

He just said let's go for brunch, and the next thing I know, I am being introduced to his chacha bua as his date. I think he just didn't want to deal with all the shaadi kab karoge questions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:03:02.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
