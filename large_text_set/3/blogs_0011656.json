The album opens with “On the Come Up” featuring Big Sean and closes with “Nothing is Promised” featuring Rihanna. \nOne of the most noticeable tracks on the album is “Perfect Pint,” where “Black Beatles” stars Rae Sremmurd and Gucci Mane team up again, but this time Kendrick Lamar is in the mix too. \nGuwop’s involvement in the project was in question while he was imprisoned. He was supposedly going to host the mixtape, but Mike WiLL changed the format to an album to allow the Trap King to be a part of it. The producer delayed Ransom 2 ‘s release from January of last year in order to get Gucci on it and also to focus on his work with Beyoncé. \n“Really had to delay # RANSOM2 to make sure everything was A1 on my end on Formation, but couldn’t spill the beans of course,” Mike WiLL Made-It said on Twitter. “To see it all rollout & be so A1, salute Bey, HOV, Big Jon, & her whole team. Now I can get # RANSOM2 done how I want to. Unfortunately the feds said no to Gucci hosting a project from jail. But when in Rome, live in Rome. New deals on the line & prior agreements etc… Saying all this to say. # RANSOM2 is now officially an album. Coming very very very soon.” \nOther stars on Ransom 2 include Young Thug, Lil Yachty and Pharrell. 21 Savage, YG and Migos also come together on the track “Gucci On My.” \nCheck out Mike WiLL Made-It’s Ransom 2 cover art and tracklist below and pre-order the album on iTunes . “On the Come Up” f.
