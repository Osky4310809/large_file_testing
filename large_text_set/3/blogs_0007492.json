Even the walls of Kremlin sported a holiday greeting this year. \nThere were those, however, who decided to bring about the holiday spirit early – including police officers seemingly taking part in a nationwide flash mob. \nIn the Tver Region, a group of officers made an 8 with their patrol cars and captured it from above with a drone. \nIn Chelyabinsk, policemen took it to another level, shaping a flower next to their cars with their own ranks. \nBelgorod police, too, picked up the trend, while in Orenburg cadets joined the officers to form the word “March” and release red balloons into the air. \nMeanwhile in Earth’s orbit, Russian cosmonauts Andrey Borisenko and Oleg Novitskiy sent their very special congratulations to women, speaking in a feed from the International Space Station (ISS): “Today, looking from the deck of the ISS at our planet, we see that it is especially beautiful, and that is all thanks to you.” \nA mysterious pilot from the city of Novosibirsk then marked Women’s Day by skywriting the huge “8” in the heavens. \nThose wishing to treat women with a March 8 surprise were not limited to men, however. A robot working for the Russian Emergencies Ministry, called Theodor, gave flowers to women in the Moscow metro, as the ministerial orchestra played and invited female onlookers for a dance. The robotic admirer usually helps firefighters, scouting ahead in extreme conditions. © moscow.mchs.ru \nMeanwhile at the iconic VDNKh trade show and amusement park in northern Moscow, an entire “Robostation” pavilion will be celebrating. It boasts of several androids that not only will give away flowers, but also read poems and shower women with compliments. \nOn an even lighter note, the Krasnoyarsk zoo decided to treat its female inhabitants who may not be human but still enjoyed a creative holiday bonus after recently giving birth. Monkeys and civets indulged edible bouquets of fruits, while porcupines got to enjoy carrot posy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:12:38.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
