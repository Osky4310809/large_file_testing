King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 9 hours ago 11 \nDave Mustaine revealed he was once addicted to \"The Punisher\" video game, reaching the point where he had to just beat the game and throw it into garbage. \nMegadeth frontman explained on Jonesy's Jukebox : \"I played PlayStation a long, long time ago, hurt my hands a lot - nintendonitis [Chuckles]. \n\"I remember the game that I got. I liked this comic from Marvel called 'The Punisher' and I got the game and I had to beat it! I promised my wife, 'I swear to God, as soon as I beat this friggin' game, I'm getting rid of it!' \n\"And sure enough, as soon as I finished it, it was gone, 'cause it just sucked me in.\" \nThe host - Sex Pistols guitarist and former gaming addict Steve Jones who was heavily into WWII sniper games - then noted that although games can mess up your life, they still offer at least some sort of brain exercise of value, to which Dave agreed. \n\"I think if you want a career running drones for the military or something like that - it might be cool,\" Mustaine said. \"It's gotten really advanced now. We've done something a few records ago [on 2007's ' United Abominations '], this song called ' Gears of War ,' that we'd written for the game 'Gears of War.' We had a lot of songs appear on 'Grand Theft Auto,' a lot of games. \n\"It's weird, because when you think of video-game music, you usually think of stuff like 'Pacman' or 'Super Mario.' When you look at some of these soundtracks for games nowadays, they're pretty stout.\" \nBack to \"The Punisher\" - as you may or may not know, the \"Punishment Due\" part 'Deth classic \" Holy Wars... The Punishment Due \" is about this very comic book.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:20:30.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
