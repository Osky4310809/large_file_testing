By April 6, partners Drew Nieporent , Robert DeNiro , Meir Teper , and Nobu Matsuhisa will open in a new location in the former AT&T building at 195 Broadway, with lunch service slated for April 10. To celebrate the move, Nobu has been offering an OG omakase, an eight-course tasting menu (for $140) with classics from the early days, as well as iconic dishes that have been mimicked in restaurants across America, like black cod with miso, toro tartar with caviar, and yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, and rock shrimp tempura. A spokesperson says there’s space for walk-ins this weekend. When the move was first announced, Nieporent said the new landlord offered them a deal they \"couldn't refuse.\" Since then, David Rockwell and The Rockwell Group has designed the 12,500 square-foot space with seats for over 180 diners, which includes 70 lounge seats and 16 bar seats, with four dedicated to the bar and lounge sushi bar. Chef Ricky Estrellado, sushi chef Ryo Hasegawa, pastry chef Jane Mun, and manager Steven Lam will steer the new location. Over on Instagram, Nieporent’s reflects on this week’s closing.
