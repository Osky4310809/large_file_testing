Watch the @Bucks on @fswisconsin , #FOXSportsGo https://t.co/50VaKZcVkZ pic.twitter.com/n6l8ZNbi95 \n— FOX Sports Wisconsin (@fswisconsin) January 19, 2017 \n\nEvery game Giannis Antetokounmpo plays for the Milwaukee Bucks is a chance to marvel at a young star in the making. \nHe regularly gives us a chance to appreciate at his ability to dunk a basketball, but he showed all of his skills on this incredible play against the Rockets on Wednesday night in Houston\nLike how do you stop that? Giannis already has 30 points and 10 boards going into the 4th. pic.twitter.com/zj4laWV97C \n— Only The NBA ™ (@OnlyTheNBA) January 19, 2017 \n\nAntetokounmpo spins away from Patrick Beverley and throws a lead pass to Malcolm Brogdon before hustling to catch up to the Bucks in transition. Brogdon sets the Bucks up in the half court and finds the streaking Greek Freak at the three-point line with a head of steam. He drives the lane, spins off a double team, stops to gather himself and dunks over Corey Brewer. \nBrewer walked away from the play like he was disappointed in his life on a fundamental level. \n\nAntetokounmpo’s dual spinning dunk was only one example of the Greek Freak putting the Rockets in the blender. \nThis man Giannis is so long! There's nothing you can do there. #TheGreekFreak pic.twitter.com/ITxPDG4cGu \n— Only The NBA ™ (@OnlyTheNBA) January 19, 2017 \n\nIf you’ve been reading the site for a while you’ve got a good feel for Giannis’ game by now. He’s freakishly long , hustles on both ends of the floor, has impressive range and outstanding athleticism . Giannis scores a good amount of his points in transition, and plays like this are exactly why fans in Milwaukee are loving the Greek Freak.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T06:08:40.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
