Havig let 37 goals slip past them, the Foxes have already conceded more this season than they did in the whole of 2015-16 (36). \nAnd it gets worse. Claudio Ranieri’s side have now gone 13 away Premier League matches without a win, more than any other team. It is their longest winless away streak since October 2005 (18). \nChanging formation was a mistake, admits Ranieri \nChelsea’s 10th placed finish in 2015-16 was previously the worst title defence of the Premier League era but Leicester are on course to claim that unwelcome mantle. And if they aren’t careful, they could emulate Manchester City’s 1937-38 achievement by being relegated as reigning champions!
