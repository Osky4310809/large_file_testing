Surrounded by palm trees and lush greenery, it’s almost like it’s in its own little park. Well, not that little—the nearly 6,000 square foot house sits on about .43 acres. \nThe five-bedroom, six-bathroom house has beautiful curved windows, elaborate archways, coved ceilings in many bedrooms, and French doors. The two-story residence features a “guest cottage” on the second level, plus a tiled terrace with an outdoor fireplace. \nThe seller is Mark Werts, the CEO of the clothing company American Rag Cie. Wertz told The Hollywood Reporter he’s selling the house because he’s “never lived in a house as long as this one, and I have ants in my pants.” \nWertz bought the house in 2010, paying $2.3 million, but he said he has done a lot of work to the residence since—“updating the pool, newly redone terraces, doorways, landscaping and the children's bathrooms.”\n2545 North Vermont Avenue [Partners Trust] American Rag CEO Mark Werts Lists Los Feliz Home for $4.195 million [THR] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T04:28:14.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
