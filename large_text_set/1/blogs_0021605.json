Unlike prior seasons, in which information slowly but surely trickled out leading up to premiere day, AHS season 6 spent months shrouded in mystery, with absolutely nothing concretely revealed about the season prior to its premiere on FX. This strategy proved quite divisive with fans, but at the end of the day, it would appear that most of those fans tuned in regardless.\nWhat they were treated to was American Horror Story: Roanoke , a season which broke the AHS mold in many ways. Presented in the style of popular paranormal documentary series like A Haunting, Roanoke embraced the found-footage style of horror storytelling, while adding in twists and turns never before seen in an AHS season. One assumes that FX must have been impressed by the season’s performance, as the network recently picked up the series for 3 more seasons.\nWhile it’s currently unclear what the themes of AHS seasons 7, 8, and 9 will be, one thing Murphy did reveal around last Halloween was his plan to produce a crossover season that combined characters and settings from both the Murder House and Coven seasons. It would stand to reason that this crossover will be one of the next 3 seasons to be produced, but time has illustrated that nothing is ever really guaranteed with Murphy and the AHS crew. In a recent conversation with EW , Murphy offered new details about the coming crossover:\n“It’s a character from season 1 that will be thrust into the world that you are left with at the end of Coven , which is sort of like the male/female/witch academy. And then all of those characters will intertwine, which is confusing because some of them are from seasons 1 and 3. Like, Sarah Paulson will probably be playing 18 characters.”\nPlaying multiple characters will certainly be nothing new for the seemingly endlessly versatile Paulson, who last year played both uptight British actress Audrey Tindall and Shelby Miller — the character Audrey played in the early reenactment episodes of Roanoke. To top things off, Paulson also made a cameo appearance near the end of the season as her Asylum character, intrepid reporter Lana Winters. Between AHS and The People v. O.J. Simpson, Paulson has arguably become Murphy’s muse, and there’s no reason to doubt that she’ll be up to whatever challenge he presents her during the crossover season.\nPerhaps the biggest question concerning the crossover at present is just which Murder House character will be “thrust into the world” of Coven. With all the repeat cast members between the two seasons, actors like Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters could very well end up talking to later versions of themselves, in the form of their Coven characters. Then again, this could also represent a chance for Murder House principals like Dylan McDermott or Connie Britton to finally make a full-on return to the series. McDermott played a small role in Asylum, and Britton hasn’t been back at all since Murder House.\nAmerican Horror Story season 7 arrives in fall 2017.\nSource: EW", "external_links": ["http://screenrant3.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Kathy-Bates-in-American-Horror-Story-Coven.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=472&fit=crop", "http://screenrant3.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Kathy-Bates-in-American-Horror-Story-Coven.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant3.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Kathy-Bates-in-American-Horror-Story-Coven.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop", "http://screenrant3.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Kathy-Bates-in-American-Horror-Story-Coven.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=547&fit=crop", "http://screenrant3.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Kathy-Bates-in-American-Horror-Story-Coven.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/23/american-horror-story-ryan-murphy-crossover-season/", "http://screenrant3.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Kathy-Bates-in-American-Horror-Story-Coven.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant3.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Kathy-Bates-in-American-Horror-Story-Coven.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=708&fit=crop", "http://screenrant3.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/Kathy-Bates-in-American-Horror-Story-Coven.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=589&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-23T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:05:51.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
