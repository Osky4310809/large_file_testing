Could   \nCristiano Ronaldo was fortunate to avoid punishment after throwing the ball at an opponent during Real Madrid's defeat to Sevilla. \nZinedine Zidane's men saw their 40-game unbeaten run come to an end at Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan as Stevan Jovetic scored a last-gasp stunner. \nRonaldo opened the scoring for the visitors with a penalty - but only after a melee between the two sets of players. \nThe Portuguese reacted angrily after Vitolo appeared to be scuffing the penalty spot and threw the ball against the back of the midfielder. \nThe incident sparked a scuffle between the two sides although both players escaped without a card.

We'll use this as motivation for our next game.\" \nThe win sees Sevilla climb back into second and just a point adrift of Madrid, while Barcelona are two off the pace. poll loading Will Real Madrid win La Liga this season? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T01:23:33.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
