Their last game coming against non-league Sutton United in the FA Cup fifth round. \nThe fixture at Anfield will no doubt have a huge bearing on the top four come the end of the season. \nBut it won't be easy for Wenger's men, Liverpool are in desperate need of a win having only won one Premier League game this calendar year. \nHere are the five best bits from Wenger's press conference: On Barcelona job? Luis Enrique will leave Barcelona at the end of the season (Photo: Getty) \nWhat Wenger said: \"I am objective enough to make the right decision for myself and the club itself. \n\"My preference [staying at Arsenal] is always the same, it will remain the same. I am not looking for jobs of other clubs or jobs of other people. \n\"I am just focusing on getting to the next level and try to improve. Competent managers always try to get better, to reinvent themselves.\" Team news Mesut Ozil should be fit to face Liverpool (Photo: Michael Regan) \nWhat Wenger said: \"Ramsey is back in full training and Koscielny as well. Elneny has an ankle problem.\" \nWill Mesut Ozil face Liverpool? \n\"We’ll see,\"said Wenger. \"I don’t know. He should be OK.\" \nOn Welbeck. \n\"He had some ups and downs with his knee problem,\" said Wenger. \"I followed the advice of medical people.\" Santi Cazorla Santi Cazorla has been absent from the Arsenal training ground (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane) \nWhat Wenger said: \"Cazorla, I am not specialised enough [to know when he’ll be back]. It is a special problem. I have not seen him in training, not even in fitness work.\" \nOn if he could play again this season? \n\"It’s possible,\" said Wenger. \"It’s very difficult to predict. It is very frustrating for us. At the start of the season he was the star of the team. It’s a big loss and I am very sad for him. He suffers a lot not being on the football pitch.\" Wanting response from players Wenger expects his men to keep fighting (Photo: Getty) \nWhat Wenger said: \"They owe themselves a performance. \n\"We responded at Sutton and we want to respond again. After that we have a chance to show Bayern we can cause them problems.” Did Gunners boss reject China job? Wenger refused to speculate (Photo: PA) \nWhat Wenger said: \"This press conference is about the Liverpool game. Not about my future or what I turned down or did not turn down.\" poll loading Who will win on Saturday? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T13:39:16.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
