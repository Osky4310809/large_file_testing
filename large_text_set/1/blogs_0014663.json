The decision caused many to wonder whether that meant Assange was ready to surrender to the Department of Justice. \n“Mr. Assange welcomes the announcement that Ms. Manning’s sentence will be reduced and she will be released in May, but this is well short of what he sought,” said Barry Pollack , Assange’s U.S.-based attorney, via email.

Last month, more than 100,000 people signed an online petition seeking commutation of Manning’s sentence, quickly meeting the required threshold. \nMany U.S. military and political officials condemned Obama’s decision.
