(Photo: Kacie Tomita) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nKhalid Robinson crosses the stage at the Don Haskins Center in El Paso, Texas, to receive his diploma from Americas High. \nJust before his name is called, he flashes his trademark smile and does a little dance for the camera broadcasting the graduation live. It's still archived on the school district's YouTube page. \nFast-forward to March. \nThe El Paso transplant’s debut album, American Teen , soared to No. 9 on the Billboard album chart.. The now mononymous Khalid’s single Location sits at No. 38 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. \n“I didn’t feel like I had a home until I moved to El Paso,” Khalid said in a phone interview from his tour bus, somewhere between shows in Atlanta and New Orleans. “The love and the friendships I made were influential. El Paso is where I started. I don’t feel like I’d be making the music I’m making now if I hadn’t gone there.” \nBut let’s rewind a bit. \nKhalid’s love affair with the border town didn’t begin until just before his senior year, when his mother, Sgt. First Class Linda Wolfe was stationed at Fort Bliss. \nWolfe had her own ambitions as an R&B singer back in the 1990s, but family and career opportunities led her to the Army. \nAnd if it wasn’t for his mom's fateful assignment, Khalid said, he might have never found himself artistically or personally. \nKhalid said life as a military kid meant moving around quite a bit and never fully knowing his place. \nThe cover of 'American Teen' (Photo: handout) \n“I feel like growing up with my mom was the foundation of my (interest in music),” Khalid said. “In my home, we listened to music all the time. I was raised through music, and I’ve been interested in it since I was three. I’ve been singing since I could talk correctly.” \nBut still, it wasn’t until moving to El Paso that he became interested in recording and writing his own music. \n“My high school was what crafted my interest in recording,” Khalid said. “Everyone at Americas showed me a lot of support. I always wanted to do music and record, but I never had the confidence to do it. I was really nervous.” \nThen, during his senior year, Khalid began to find himself musically. He recorded the songs Saved and Stuck On You , and uploading them to his Soundcloud page. \nBy spring, and with “prom right around the corner,” Khalid said he was eager to get a new song out. \nIt was then that Khalid traveled to Atlanta to work on the song that would eventually become his breakthrough. \nTunji Balogun, vice president of A&R for RCA Records, said he began following Khalid after several of his early Soundcloud uploads caught his ear. \n“When he put out Location , I thought, ‘Oh, my God, this kid knows how to make a hit,’ in addition to being a talented vocalist and being ahead of his age,” Balogun said. \nHe wasn’t alone. \nSoon after it was released, Kylie Jenner posted a video of herself and friends listening to the song on Snapchat. The co-sign from the reality TV star helped propel the sultry song, with its catchy refrain and lyrics that delve into love in the smartphone era, to more than 12.5 million streams on Soundcloud. \nAll this from a song Khalid says he almost didn’t finish after trying to write and record with the song’s producers in Atlanta. Tired, but unfazed, Khalid retreated to El Paso, where he wrote and recorded the song while his mom and friends hung out in the studio. \n“It’s crazy to see a song I almost didn’t record is doing super well. It’s special because I recorded it around friends and family,” Khalid said. \nAfter Billboard announced the top 10 debut of American Teen , Khalid said, “Two years ago, I would’ve never imagined being in the position of life that I am now.\" \nBut, Khalid said, no matter where he is, he’ll take with him the humble and open-minded attitude of his heart’s most beloved location — El Paso — as well as the advice of his hero: his mom. \n“To always stay grounded and never forget where you came from — and take care of your voice,” Khalid said, no doubt flashing that big smile he shared before crossing the graduation stage less than a year ago. 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:23:29.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
