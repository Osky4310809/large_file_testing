Where were Schumer’s tears then? \nWhy were the people who were in greatest danger in Syria, the religiously persecuted, not prioritized under Obama? Was that “mean-spirited?” \nWhy were the people who worked for the U.S. and were promised visas slow-walked by the Obama regime from getting those visas? So much so that some of them were killed while waiting? Was that “mean-spirited?” \nBut people who could be not adequately vetted, even according to our FBI director, coming from places where ISIS was rampant, were allowed to enter. \nThat obviously wasn’t “mean-spirited,” right? \nPerhaps Schumer can answer all these questions… LIKE this article?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T06:01:03.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
