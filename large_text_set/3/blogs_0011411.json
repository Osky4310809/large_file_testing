In this case, he made an epic 200-foot slide down the hill and loved ever minute of it! \nHis handler and human, Chris Child, skiied after him and caught the dog’s joyous slide on video, and the video is now going viral. “He slides like this occasionally, when he’s hot or just for fun,” said ski patroller Chris Child. “This was probably his longest slide so far, and I was lucky to get it on camera.” \nI think Truckee deserves every minute of fun he can get, given the job he has. \nCheck out Truckee letting loose and having some fun and share it with your friends!
