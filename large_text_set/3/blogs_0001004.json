Its creation appears to be a cold reference to Baby and Wayne’s longstanding beef that appears to be unresolvable, no matter who plays mediator . A post shared by Birdman5star (@birdman5star) on Mar 1, 2017 at 2:10pm PST \nDespite numerous interviews with Angie Martinez, Birdman has been notoriously tight-lipped in discussing the specifics of his issues with Lil Wayne, who he actually raised as his own son (this includes his instant classic Breakfast Club interview ). Gauging from the trailer, Before Anythang (or Before Anything , depending on which spelling you want to go with from the promos) doesn’t appear to be poised to answer those questions as it primarily focuses on the 48-year-old multi-millionaire mogul’s ascension to power and fame despite the stacked odds the NOLA streets had against him. \nAt this year’s NBA All-Star Weekend , which also took place in his hometown, Birdman promised that new albums from Drake, Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne would be dropping in 2017 — although there was no real clarity as to whether the Weezy album would be the long-delayed Carter V . \nIn an exclusive interview with HipHopDX , former Cash Money in-house superproducer Mannie Fresh spoke on his methods to try to get the now bitter rivals to patch up their differences. \n“I’m kinda thinking, real talk I could be the medium. I get that Wayne gotta get his money, but I’m hoping that I could be the middle person that resolve it. I’m hoping that I could be the person to say ‘How can we fix this? How can we all like sit at one table, break bread and do something epic again?’” an optimistic Fresh revealed to DX. \nIn the meantime, the Birdman Before Anythang documentary is slated to release exclusively on Apple Music come May 12 and will be co-produced by both Jimmy Iovine and Larry Jackson. \nWatch the official trailer down below.
