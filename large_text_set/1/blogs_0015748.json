But we will certainly report any funny stories caused by apparent misunderstandings that reinforce said stereotype. \nThere was, for instance, the time a presumably white British man named Stuart Lynn ordered “very mild” venison curry from an Indian restaurant. When he received his takeaway dish, Lynn claimed that he was appalled to see the words “***VERY MILD, WHITE PPL***” written on the bill.

And while this begs the question of what other color milk could possibly be, lulz ensued because the implications, intentional or not, were funny. \nIn a very similar vein, Reddit recently lit up with a post titled “ The non-spicy option at my local Korean place ,” which showed a restaurant’s spice spectrum ranging from “Extra spicy” (two red peppers) to “White” (white/empty pepper). Korean restaurant’s menu goes viral for labelling its least spicy food ‘white’ https://t.co/mmVQCeugwF pic.twitter.com/TkqfPEb1Eb \n— Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) January 12, 2017 \nThe post garnered more than 8,000 upvotes, 200 comments, and international attention because of the obvious implication that, once again, white people can’t handle the hot stuff. Surprisingly, the comments section did not generate into a racist Internet hate machine thread, and instead tried to explain the linguistic root of the misunderstanding. \nApparently, the Korean word for “pure” is very similar to “white,” meaning that, in all likelihood, the grading scale here is referring to a dish without any spice on it. \n\nThe menu appears to be from Toronto Koreatown restaurant Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu , and it’s not the first time that this heat scale made its way onto Reddit. MUNCHIES reached out to the restaurant, but a member of staff said that they could not provide comment on the matter. \nBack in 2014, another post entitled “ Spicy Food Level: White ” with a picture of the same menu received 2,440 upvotes, though that time around, the comments section was more fixated on hacky racist jokes and stereotypes than any kind of linguistic elucidation. \nHow times have changed. And yet, for whatever reason, the image of white people wiping sweat off of their brow and breathing heavily while they eat an “authentic” spicy dish seems to ring eternal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:51:04.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
