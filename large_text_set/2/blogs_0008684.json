Prep for the Next Award Show: Host an Oscar Night Party Host a festive and glamorous Oscar night party with a \"Golden Age of Hollywood\" theme that will make every guest feel like a star. A Gilded Table \nTo translate the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\" theme into a beautiful table design, start with a clean white-on-white canvas and incorporate bright pops of gold. A DIY table runner made entirely out of metallic gold confetti creates a glamorous focal point, while beautiful white blooms add a stunning finishing touch. Raise Your Glasses \nMix and match a variety of vintage glassware for water and bubbly. For an added festive element, create a metallic swizzle stick by cutting wooden skewers to fit the height of your glass, and use hot glue to secure a pom of golden tinsel to the top of it. Take a Seat \nEach place setting consists of a white dinner and salad plate, white napkin and bright gold flatware. Hand-write guests' names on white card stock, then slide into a festive place card. These were made by simply covering a florist frog pin with gold spray paint, then sprinkling with a heavy coat of glitter. Bon Appetit! \nOnce guests have taken their seat, delight taste buds with a seated first course. This salad includes mixed greens, sliced blood oranges, salted almonds and sweet dates. Delicious and simple to assemble, it can be prepared in advance and will make a lasting first impression on hungry guests. Take Your Pick \nOnce the first course has been served, invite guests to help themselves to a buffet stocked with delicious hors d'oeuvres. Small bites like deviled quail eggs, duck a l'orange and lobster lollipops are a modern take on classic hors d'oeuvres, and are substantial enough to serve as guests' dinner. How Sweet It Is \nWhen the main course is drawing to an end, set up a gilded and glamorous dessert buffet. Guests will be delighted to indulge in cupcakes shimmering with gold luster dust, panna cotta with shooting star shortbread and, most whimsical of all, Oscar-shaped sugar cookies atop a chocolate fudge brownie stand. Set the Scene \nWhen it's time to move to the living room, set the scene with cozy pillows, throw blankets and plenty of popcorn. Then let the celeb chatter ensue as everyone watches the stars make their acceptance speeches. Most importantly, keep the bubbly chilled and within reach. Get Out the Games \nPrint out these bingo cards, and hand one out to each guest when the awards ceremony begins, along with a sheet of metallic stickers. Compete to clear off a row of squares with each memorable moment in the award show, and reward the first guest to score bingo with a bottle of champagne or pair of movie tickets. Oscar Night Party: Inspiration Board \nFor a night as elegant as the Academy Awards, my decor elements come together to say \"Hollywood glamour,\" and what better way to do so than with lots of gold and sparkle? Set against a modern white palette, layers of metallic glitter, tinsel and confetti convey festivity and are sure to make each guest feel like a winner.
