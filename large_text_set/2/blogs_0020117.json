Share it! 176 Shares \nAre you planning on traveling any time soon? If you are — and you're from one nine states — you better have something other than a driver's license as a form of ID. \nResidents of Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Washington will have to use alternate ID forms (passport, military ID, or permanent resident card) to pass TSA security checkpoints — even for domestic travel. The TSA has started placing signage around airport security checkpoints to inform travelers of the new TSA rules going into effect in 2018. \nWhy the switch? \nThe IDs from these nine states do not meet the federal government’s minimum security standards. And, according to the REAL ID Act of 2005, federal agencies (like the TSA) are prohibited from “accepting for certain purposes driver’s licenses and identification cards from states not meeting the Act’s minimum standards.” The TSA said in a statement that if the nine states change their ID process, the government “may grant extensions or determine compliance for additional states as warranted.\" \nAs for travelers who are not from the nine states, they won’t be affected by the change in 2018. But by 2020, all travelers must have identification in compliance with REAL ID or they will not be allowed through TSA security checkpoints. \n(And we know how stressful that can be already.) Only twenty-four states (plus Washington, D.C.) currently comply with the rules set forward in the act. \nThe remaining states have been given extensions through 2017 to meet REAL ID standards. \nSo what should you do if you’re from one of those nine states and planning on traveling soon? \nYou can either get a passport or wait and see if your state’s laws change in time to comply with the TSA. And the TSA added that they will update signage if and when states that are currently listed receive extensions. \nBetter safe than sorry!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:06:21.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
