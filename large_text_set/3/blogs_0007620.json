USA TODAY Sports Glennon is 5-13 as a starting quarterback. (Photo: Reinhold Matay, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIf the Chicago Bears decide after one season they’ve seen enough of Mike Glennon, they won’t be stuck in a salary-dump situation like the Houston Texans with Brock Osweiler. \nMake no mistake – Glennon cashed in after his four years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His three-year, $45 million contract with the Bears fully guarantees him $18.5 million in the first 12 months, according to contract details obtained by USA TODAY Sports. \nThat includes a $3 million signing bonus, $5 million roster bonus, $8 million guaranteed base salary and $2.5 million through either incentives or a roster bonus next March. But the Bears could cut ties from there if it doesn’t work, with no further guaranteed money. And if it does work, they’ll have a pretty good deal on their hands. \nMORE NFL: Even if Redskins' Kirk Cousins is unhappy, don't expect a holdout \nGlennon’s 2018 base salary is $12.5 million. In 2019, he has a $2 million roster bonus due in March and a $12 million base salary. Because his signing bonus is just $3 million, the cap hit if the Bears ever cut him is negligible. His $15 million average per year ties for 20th among current quarterback contracts with, of all people, New England Patriots star Tom Brady. \nThis is definitely not a repeat of the Texans’ $37 million fully guaranteed commitment to Osweiler last year – exactly double the fully guaranteed money that Glennon got. And unlike the Texans, who had to throw in a second-round pick just to get the Cleveland Browns to take Osweiler’s $16 million salary for 2017 off their hands in a trade Thursday, the Bears can get out after one year, not two. \nOf course, the Bears are surely hoping Glennon plays well enough they won’t even be thinking about that. \nPHOTOS: Notable NFL players changing teams Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
