Imgur \nIn the text message, Dee tells the guy to stop texting her phone because her boyfriend found out about their relationship and it’s over. \nThe stranger replies by telling the sad girl she doesn’t need her ex anyway, then lies about his true identity when the girl asks if she’s speaking to Jackson. \nShe starts to open up about how sad she feels, then sends a text message, saying, \nI devoted everything to him… like, I gave him everything… my life my love and most of my belongings. I knew this would happen… [This] is my fault. Imgur \nThe guy gives this unfaithful girl an unexpected dose of reality by replying, \nWell yes it is your fault. If you truly devoted everything to him you wouldn’t have gotten involved with me. \nThen he dishes out some words of wisdom, writing, \nWell Dee, I hope you’ve learned from your mistakes. To be cheated on sucks and karma’s a bitch. So use this as a life lesson and go into your next relationship with all of your heart. And don’t cheat. But in my experience, once a cheater, always a cheater. Imgur \nThe guy wishes her all the best, saying, \nI truly do hope you get through this and I can tell that you’re hurt by this. Maybe Kevin will come around. \nThen drops a bomb on the girl by writing, \nP.S. This isn’t Jackson. \nWhen Dee asks the mysterious guy to reveal his true identity, he replies, “just some random stranger that’s been cheated on.” \nMaybe Dee will think about this kind stranger’s advice next time she’s tempted to stray away from her significant other.
