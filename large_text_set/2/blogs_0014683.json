Ben Stokes, Rising Pune Supergiants England all-rounder Stokes is making his debut in the competition, and as commentator Harsha Bhogle noted, his fee exceeded expectations: Harsha Bhogle @bhogleharsha Was expecting big money for @benstokes38 but this is a lot! Will have pressure on him to win games for #RPS 2/20/2017, 4:51:07 AM Indeed, he's not only the priciest overseas player in IPL history, he's also not far off the £1.9 million (16 crores) that the Delhi Daredevils paid for Yuvraj Singh in 2015, per the Press Association (h/t the Guardian's Ali Martin ). What makes the fee all the more remarkable is that Stokes may not even be available to play at the end of the competition due to his commitments with England. Cricket statistician Mohandas Menon broke down Stokes' value in each area of the game: Mohandas Menon @mohanstatsman 2/20/2017, 5:07:27 AM Stokes is a fine player, though with ball in hand, Pune will hope he can improve his economy rate. In Twenty20, his overall economy is 8.60, according to ESPNcricinfo —a rate that was bettered by 64 players in the IPL last year—and in the World T20 final, he was hit for four consecutive sixes by Carlos Brathwaite. Nevertheless, they've acquired a fine all-rounder who has the potential to be one of the star's of this year's tournament. Tymal Mills, Royal Challengers Bangalore After Mitchell Starc pulled out of this year's IPL, Royal Challengers Bangalore were left needing a left-arm fast bowler. The man replacing the Australian is Mills, who is England's quickest bowler . IAN KINGTON/Getty Images Former England captain Michael Vaughan was pleased for the 24-year-old, who can only play short-form cricket because of a back injury: Michael Vaughan @MichaelVaughan Also delighted for @tmills15..Forced out of the longer format through injury.. Great that T20 has given these type of players another life The rising star expressed his delight at having joined Bangalore: Tymal Mills @tmills15 Seriously crazy morning! Thank you for all the messages, can't wait to join up with everyone at @RCBTweets #PlayBold https://t.co/ew03SkZWAm 2/20/2017, 9:22:48 AM He faces a tough challenge in replacing Starc, who bagged 34 wickets in 27 IPL matches, as well as maintaining an economy of 7.16 and a strike rate of 17.05, according to the tournament's official website . Mills' overall T20 stats aren't too far off those, having taken 63 wickets in 55 matches with an economy and strike rate of 7.47 and 17.7, respectively —he can fill in capably for Starc if he plays at his best. Trent Boult, Kolkata Knight Riders Trent Boult was also among the the top buys on Monday as he was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders for five crores ($750,000, per the Guardian 's Geoff Lemon and Russell Jackson ). Anthony Au-Yeung/Getty Images The 27-year-old previously turned out for Sunrisers Hyderabad but played in just one match last year. KKR bowling coach Lakshmipathy Balaji gave insight into the purchase: KolkataKnightRiders @KKRiders Our bowling coach L Balaji talks about the new additions to our bowling attack. #IPLAuction #KnightsOf2017 https://t.co/d0dal4zz3A Meanwhile, ESPNcricinfo's Freddie Wilde provided Boult's recent stats: Freddie Wilde @fwildecricket Since the start of 2015 Boult has 21 wickets in 17 matches at an economy rate of 8.59. #IPL #IPLAuction 2/20/2017, 5:07:06 AM Boult offered a timely reminder of his talents in New Zealand's T20 international defeat to South Africa on Thursday, as in the midst of a poor Kiwis performance, he took two wickets and conceded just eight runs in four overs. If he can replicate anything close to that kind of form during this year's IPL, he could prove to be an outstanding buy.
