(We talked with another partner, Georgios Kasselakis, last year .) \nWhile Tziralis describes himself as someone who tried — and failed — twice at being a software entrepreneur, he also launched Open Coffee , a popular meeting series for founders who get together monthly to talk shop. \nMarathon was also cofounded by Panos Papadopoulos, who first met Tziralis a decade ago when starting his first company — which he describes as an Airbnb for exchange students in Athens — and who went on to cofound Bugsense. The mobile analytics company, which would eventually wind up in the Bay Area, was acquired in 2013, two years after its founding, by the publicly traded tech company Splunk. (The price wasn’t disclosed at the time, but Papadopoulos says Splunk paid roughly $9 million in cash – a good outcome for investors who had invested just $100,000 into the company.) \nApparently, the two had crossed paths various times over the past decade; they came together when Tziralis told Papadopoulos that he was spinning out of OpenFund, and Papadopoulos – who was ready to return home from California – decided that he’d rather become a VC in Greece than start another company. \nExplains Papadopoulos, “There aren’t these great enterprises in Greece [as in the U.S.] where college graduates want to work. A lot of people have moved abroad in the last four years and established experience and a network and are thinking more globally and who are interesting to us as investors.” \nPapadoplous says that the tech scene in Athens is maturing, too. “Ten years ago, there was very little capital and startups were practically non-existent. But that’s changed. The community has grown strong. Startups are now top of mind for a lot of college graduates. And Greece has a lot of talent. We don’t have product companies, so we don’t have product managers. But in Greece, they almost overemphasize education, so we have mathematics PhDs and biology PhDs. We have people who’ve done research and studies and who once might have wanted to research funded by the European Union but are now looking at startups as something they want to tap instead.” \nSo far, Marathon’s funding has come exclusively from individuals, including from numerous shipping families and other local industrialists who’ve grown more interested in Athens’s evolving tech scene. \nNow, the duo is hoping their track record gets them past their $25 million goal by the end of the third quarter. Among their collective investments is the cloud-based recruitment startup Workable , which is based in Boston and has raised roughly $34 million from investors so far; Resin.io , a Seattle-based startup that helps Linux-based developers more easily update the software in internet-connected devices and has raised more than $12 million to date; and TaxiBeat , a taxi-hailing smart phone app that sold just last month to the automative giant Daimler. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:17:36.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
