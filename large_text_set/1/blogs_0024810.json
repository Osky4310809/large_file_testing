Team ET Wealth You earn well but are unable to save. You have no idea where your salary goes. You are sometimes forced to borrow to pay your bills. If any of these statements applies to you, it’s time to write down a household budget . Many people are put off by the word budget because they associate it with restrictions on spending and frugal lifestyles. That’s a misconception. Budgeting does not make you spend less, but allows you to spend smart. “A good budget lets you focus your money on the things that are most important to you,” says personal finance expert Carl Richards. By preventing you from overspending on less important items, a budget channelises resources to areas that should be given priority. In the post-demonetisation economy, tracking expenses is not very cumbersome. But the use of plastic and other cashless modes means that overspending can be a problem. This is where budgeting apps play a critical role. They help track your expenses and alert you if you exceed certain limits. Beep! if you overshoot the limit on dining out. Beep! beep! If you swipe your card too many times at the garment showroom. Don’t underestimate the utility of this feature. Overspending on eating out and clothing is the most common reason why young people lose out on the golden years of compounding. If you save Rs 10,000 a month in an option that earns 10% annually, your corpus at the end of 30 years would be a massive Rs 2.16 crore. But if you start five years late at 35, your corpus will be smaller by almost Rs 96 lakh. The derailing of financial goals is not the only problem. Shopaholism can ruin careers, wreck relationships and cause disharmony in married life. An online survey conducted by ET Wealth found that spending too much was the most common reason for money arguments among couples. The problem was very pronounced (52%) among younger couples below 30, and gradually decreased (34.9%) among older people after 40. As we all know, the profusion of choices offered by e-retailers and the convenience of online payments have led to an overshopping epidemic in India. Most buyers, especially the younger set, don’t realise that every unnecessary purchase pushes back their long-term goals. “Shopping is not a vice, but it can become a problem if the expenses prevent the individual from saving for critical financial goals,” says D.P. Singh of SBI Mutual Fund. Budgeting can prevent such situations. It prioritises your expenses and allocates resources in a way that all your financial commitments are addressed. Research shows that households that follow a budget save more money than families that haven’t laid down rules. This is simply because if a family has allocated some money for investment, that amount will automatically get invested every month. On the other hand, the family with no budget will tend to overspend on discretionary items and push long-term goals on the backburner. If you still think you don’t need to formulate a household budget, click here to take a short test and find out if you are right. It will give you a fair idea of where your finances are headed and what you should do to get a grip. Write it down The first step in budgeting is to write down the various sources of your income. This includes salary, rent, interest on deposits, dividends, etc. Then make a list of expenses incurred in a month and allocate money to each of these heads. Include everything, from the grocery bill to what you pay the maid, from the fuel expenses to the EMI of the car. Anything and everything that is paid for should be in the list. For some expenses, such as school fee or insurance premium which are paid every quarter or once a year, you may have to calculate the monthly figure. There’s a widely used 50:30:20 rule of budgeting. This back-ofthe-envelope principle says 50% of your income should be used for essential expenses (food, shelter, clothing), 30% should be used for discretionary spending and 20% should be put into savings. But this is not an iron-clad allocation and could vary across individuals and financial circumstances. Those with big-ticket home loans may find that their housing cost is almost 50-60% of their income. We looked at the spending pattern of the average middle-class urban Indian household and tweaked the formula to make it 60:20:20. Compare your own expense allocation to know where you stand. How a family should spend every month Here’s how much a household income of Rs 1 lakh per month should be allocated under different heads. Essential expenses: 60 % of the income should be spent on these essential items. Food and groceries : 18.8% : Rs 15,000 Healthcare (including insurance): 4% : Rs 4,000 Life insurance : 3% : Rs 3,000 Housing : 20% : Rs 12,000", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T07:57:35.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
