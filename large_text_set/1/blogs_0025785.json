(Photo: Michael Reynolds, epa) \nAt 8 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, President Trump is set to unveil his pick to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant for almost year since the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia. When he does so, we are going to learn a lot about either Trump's commitment to keeping his promises, or the conservative movement's commitment to principle. \nMake no mistake, Trumpâ€™s promise to appoint pro-life justices is perhaps the most important promise for him to keep. President Clinton's voters once chose to overlook his problematic peccadilloes because, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Trump's conservative base did the same last year, also because of a pre-eminent concern. \nThis time, the defining issue was the Supreme Court. According to exit polls, one in five voters named Supreme Court appointments as the most important factor in their vote. Trump won them by a whopping 15 points. \nOn top of that, Trump is filling the sizable shoes of Scalia, perhaps the most revered conservative judge of his time. So replacing him with anything less than a Scalia, even if it would undoubtedly be an upgrade over anyone named by a President Hillary Clinton, is a loss leader for conservatives. Coming off a confusing weekend with the clumsy rollout of his immigration executive orders, the last thing Trump needs is to make a stealth pick that instead of uniting conservatives causes them to turn on each other.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:18:17.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
