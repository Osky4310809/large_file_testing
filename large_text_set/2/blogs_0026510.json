Credit Kevin Berne/Berkeley Repertory Theater Playwrights Horizons , an Off Broadway nonprofit focused on American playwrights, plans to stage five world premieres as well as a new play by Sarah Ruhl as part of its next season. The theater company announced Tuesday that it would open its season late in the summer with Ms. Ruhl’s latest play, “For Peter Pan on Her 70th Birthday,” which was produced last year at the Actors Theater of Louisville and at Berkeley Repertory Theater. The show, beginning previews Aug. 18, is about a woman who played Peter Pan at a children’s theater 50 years earlier, now facing the death of her father. It will be directed by Les Waters, the artistic director of the Actors Theater, and will star Kathleen Chalfant (“Wit”). Both have been with the project from the start. Ms. Ruhl is a two-time Pulitzer finalist, for “The Clean House” and “In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play).” The five world premieres will follow: • “The Treasurer,” written by Max Posner (“Judy”) and directed by David Cromer (“The Band’s Visit”), about the relationship between an aging woman with money problems and her son, who is trying to control her spending. • “Mankind,” written and directed by Robert O’Hara (“ Bootycandy ”), an allegory set in a time when women have become extinct. • “This Flat Earth,” written by Lindsey Ferrentino (“Ugly Lies the Bone”) and directed by Rebecca Taichman (“Indecent”), about two 13-year-olds grappling with a crisis at their middle school. • “Dance Nation,” written by Clare Barron (“You Got Older”) and directed by Lee Sunday Evans (“Bull in a China Shop”), about preteen competitive dancers. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:09:33.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
