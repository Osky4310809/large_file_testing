By Cameron Wolfe | | The Denver Post February 9, 2017 at 6:14 pm Guest Commentary: When Donald Trump attacks a judge, he attacks democracy itself \nThe Broncos’ offseason should feature much less drama than in recent years. \nNo big retirement announcements are expected. No franchise tag players are negotiating into mid-July. No free agents will be signing eye-opening contracts. But don’t expect the Broncos to be quiet. \nWith a new coaching staff looking to upgrade at several positions, the 2017 Broncos can be expected to look much different from the 2016 team. \nThe Broncos could have more than $40 million in salary cap space to work with when free agency begins March 9, depending on what they do with offensive tackles Russell Okung and Donald Stephenson . Denver could also have 10 draft picks when compensatory selections are announced in March. That’s plenty of money, and picks, which should have a big impact on the roster. \nAs for quarterback, coach Vance Joseph insists he’s committed to Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch competing for the starting job. That’s subject to change, depending on which veteran quarterbacks are available, but for now the focus will be on fixing the offensive and defensive lines, beginning in free agency. \nOffensive line coach Jeff Davidson , a 22-year NFL coaching veteran, has a background of favoring a power blocking scheme. His assistant, John Benton , is a zone scheme specialist. Denver will run a mixture of both. \n“Our offense will go as far as our offensive line will take them,” offensive coordinator Mike McCoy said. “Jeff Davidson and John will make them play better, and they will play better next year.” \nThe Broncos have to decide whether to retain Okung, their left tackle, who is due a four-year, $48 million contract if his option is exercised by March 8. Stephenson, a right tackle, could be released before his 2017 salary is guaranteed March 13. \nLook for Denver to target at least one starting-level offensive tackle in free agency. It could also use an upgrade at guard. \nSome of the possible fits scheduled to hit free agency include Baltimore Ravens right tackle Rick Wagner, Cincinnati Bengals left tackle Andrew Whitworth, Detroit Lions right tackle Riley Reiff and guard Larry Warford and Dallas Cowboys guard Ronald Leary. \nCBS salary cap analyst and former agent Joel Corry believes the Broncos should try to restructure Okung’s deal at about $8 million per year given the low supply and high demand of left tackles. Corry said right tackles are the “stepchild of offensive line compensation,” so Wagner and Reiff may be able to be signed for $8 million per year. That’s also the likely price range for second-tier guards such as Warford and Leary. \nOffensive line is the Broncos’ biggest need. Defensive line is next. \nDefensive coordinator Joe Woods said the Broncos missed Malik Jackson (free-agency departure) and Vance Walker (torn anterior cruciate ligament in August) more than they anticipated. Their run defense dropped from third overall in 2015 to 28th in 2016. \n“We got thin at that position. It showed up,” Woods said. “That’s something we’re going to address this offseason.” \nArizona defensive end Calais Campbell, a Denver native, makes sense as a pass rusher and a run stuffer if the Broncos can sign him as a free agent. Corry believes Campbell will demand more than Seattle defensive lineman Michael Bennett’s reported three-year, $31.5 million extension signed in December. \nIf the price has decreased, the Broncos could also rekindle trade talks with troubled New York Jets defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson. \nDenver also may be looking for an upgrade at nose tackle. Baltimore’s Brandon Williams is the top free-agent option. He may be looking for more than $10 million per year, however. Philadelphia’s Bennie Logan and Washington’s Chris Baker are second-tier options. The price to sign Kansas City’s Dontari Poe may fluctuate dependent on how teams view the seriousness of his back injuries. \n“You need a guy that’s stout, because they’re getting double-teamed,” defensive line coach Bill Kollar said about nose tackles. “But he has to have some mobility. Can’t just be a plug.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:21:14.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
