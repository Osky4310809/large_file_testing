That has meant continuing to play golf with Lisa accompanying him on the road, where she keeps up with her treatments at hospitals wherever the PGA Tour stop happens to be.\n“We didn’t know what the future looked like at that point and I think both of us didn’t want cancer to completely halt us in our tracks … even though it’s completely halted us in our tracks,’’ said Cink, who’s playing the Honda Classic this week at PGA National. “I’m not going anywhere anytime soon unless she’s with me. There’s not a lot I want to do without her.’’\nCink recalled playing in the Colonial last May, about three weeks after Lisa’s diagnosis.\n“I learned really fast that I wasn’t ready to be out there,” Cink said.\n“We’re each other’s support structure out here. I don’t know any other way to do it. I don’t want to stop playing and she doesn’t want me to stop playing. She’s going to travel as long as she feels like it … and she feels good right now.’’\nCink said they’ve both leaned heavily on their faith and on fellow PGA Tour players such as Ben Crane, Davis Love III, Zach Johnson and, more recently, Kyle Reifers, and their wives.\n“Without that, it would be very difficult out here, because this game can be very lonely,’’ Cink said. “Even when you’re playing great it’s lonely, but when you’re playing poorly it’s really lonely.’’\nCink poses with Lisa and his sons, Connor and Reagan, after winning the Open Championship in 2009. Getty Images There’s no lonelier time than that moment when you first hear the diagnosis. When I heard the word “chemotherapy’’ from my doctors, the first thing that came to my mind was that I was going to die.\n“There are certain things that happen in your life that you never forget where you were and the details are clear in your mind, and that was one of those moments,’’ Cink said. “You feel helpless all the time. The more you learn about this, the less control you feel like you have.’’\nCink is not uncomfortable being asked about his wife’s cancer. The effect is quite the opposite, in fact.\n“You asking me about it makes me think that you care,’’ he said. “That’s a good feeling. It’s a little therapeutic to talk about it. When you’re discussing it you’re not thinking about the future; you’re talking about what you already know. It’s good to be a little grounded in the present.\n“And,’’ Cink said, “right now the present is pretty good.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:45:59.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
