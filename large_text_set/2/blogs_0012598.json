The Republican president has pledged to increase deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally, build a wall along the Mexican border, and ban people from certain majority-Muslim countries from coming into the U.S. He also has blamed high unemployment on immigration. \nEmployers and institutions in some cities were already expressing solidarity Wednesday with immigrant workers. Washington restaurateur John Andrade said he would close his businesses Thursday, and David Suro, owner of Tequilas Restaurant in Philadelphia and a Mexican immigrant, said he also planned to participate. \nThe Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Massachusetts said it would remove or shroud all artwork created or given by immigrants to the museum through Feb. 21. \nOrganizers in Philadelphia said they expect hundreds of workers and families to participate. \n\"Our goal is to highlight the need for Philadelphia to expand policies that stop criminalizing communities of color,\" said Erika Almiron, executive director of Juntos, a nonprofit group that works with the Latino immigrant community. \"What would happen if massive raids did happen? What would the city look like?\" \nAlmiron said that while community groups have not seen an uptick in immigration raids in the city, residents are concerned about the possibility. \nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney is among leaders in several cities nationwide who have vowed to maintain their \"sanctuary city\" status and decline to help federal law enforcement with deportation efforts. \nMany people who make the choice to skip work Thursday will not be paid in their absence, but social media posts encouraging participation stressed that the cause is worth the sacrifice. \n- By Errin Haines Whack / Associated Press View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:41:30.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
