The first was established in New York City in 1980.\n“The SFPD is committed to public safety and will continue to work diligently to keep San Francisco safe for everyone,” San Francisco police Sgt. Michael Andraychak said in a statement.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:42:29.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
