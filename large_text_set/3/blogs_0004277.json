Care To Take A Guess? Share Share Tweet \nFormer Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes seems to have been triggered by these three words that President Trump uttered during his address to a joint session of Congress last night: Radical Islamic terrorism. \nTrump said in his speech, “Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.” \n“What was accomplished by declaring war on \"radical Islamic terrorism\"? Just alienating Muslim allies who we need, and emboldening terrorists,” tweeted Rhodes. \nYeah, this coming from the guy whose administration gave what could arguably be ransom payments to Iran, crafted a nuclear deal with Iran that has never been honored (Iran just recently conducted a ballistic missile test), and called ISIS the “ JV team .” Well, that was a big mistake . Former President Obama even said ISIS was “ contained ” one day before the horrific terror attack in Paris, which was executed…by ISIS.

Just alienating Muslim allies who we need, and emboldening terrorists — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) March 1, 2017 Hush now, you had your turn. And it didn't go all that swell. https://t.co/Jp89Lggn82 — Caleb Howe (@CalebHowe) March 1, 2017 You gave pallets of cash to Iran & used hostages as a negotiating ploy. Probably should sit out the emboldening terrorists discussion https://t.co/OcMDUKt97y — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) March 1, 2017 \nYour way didn’t work, Mr. Rhodes. It’s time for a new direction and we have a new sheriff in town to make that happen. Oh, and did I mention that the smart power doctrine Obama channeled has been a complete and total disaster for our country?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:44:17.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
