King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 8 hours ago 22 \nChecking in from the inaugural Hall of Heavy Metal History induction ceremony, Kerry King said he's baffled by the fact that Lemmy Kilmister and Ronnie James Dio are not in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame yet. \nSlayer guitarist told Loudwire : \"It's kind of like Ken Stabler not going into the NFL Hall of Fame. They waited 'till he died, when he can't enjoy it. And that's a super bummer. \n\"Dio is one of my Top 2 singers of all time and he was a good friend and a good dude. Lemmy - the career speaks for itself. \n\"Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is weird; it's privately owned, so people from the music industry don't vote - I don't actually know how it works. I've been there and it's very cool; I expected to stay an hour and stayed there for like 3 hours - it was very cool. \n\"But yes, they motherfucking should be in the Hall of Fame.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:52:51.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
