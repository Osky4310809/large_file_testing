According to the report, approximately 2,010 HuJI and JMB operatives entered the three Indian states. This far exceeds Indian intelligence estimates of infiltrations from Bangladesh and poses a serious regional security challenge.\nIt will be recalled that India’s NIA had found the direct role of JMB in the October 2014 Burdwan blast that killed two suspected terrorists and led to the discovery of a bomb-making unit. Investigators have also found that terrorists involved in the Dhaka café attack in July last year that led to the deaths of 20 hostages – including an Indian national – had used guns that were procured from Bengal. Such evidences highlight linkages between Bangladeshi extremists and support networks on this side of the border. At a time when the Bangladeshi government is cracking down on militant Islamist groups on its soil, Indian border states should not serve as safe havens or easy transit points for extremists.\nTrue, much of the India-Bangladesh border is riverine, making it difficult to fence or patrol. But such challenges need to be overcome through use of technology and enhanced coordination with Bangladeshi security forces. It’s also a fact that India-Bangladesh border areas are hubs of criminal activities such as smuggling and human trafficking that provide cover to extremists crossing over. Hence, failing to crack down on these border criminal gangs – who often operate under local political patronage – aids cross-border terror elements. With Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visiting India next month, New Delhi should take this opportunity to put in place a coordinated security plan involving Bangladesh and Indian border states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:00:10.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
