Watching fish swim around isn’t that exciting, but seeing puppies and kittens play around is one of the greatest things on earth. This year’s Puppy Bowl featured numerous playful pooches, but one three-legged dog named Lucky stood out from the rest. Lucky was found abandoned underneath a porch, and as if that weren’t bad enough, she later broke her leg and had to get it amputated. Luckily, Lucky has made a full recovery and, along with her brother Ricky, was able to play in the legendary Puppy Bowl . While Lucky’s time in the game was limited, her impact was not, as Animal Planet announced on its Twitter page that Lucky had won the Underdog Award.
