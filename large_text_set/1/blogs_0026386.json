The bookies, of course, have been quick to offer odds. \nAccording to the bet-makers, Ben Whishaw - best known for playing Q in recent Bond films Spectre and Skyfall - is the favourite. The actor was rumoured to replace Matt Smith when he stepped down from the role but ended up having a highly successful Hollywood career. \nNext up is Richard Ayoade, of IT Crowd fame. The comedian has just signed with Channel 4 to present the upcoming series of The Crystal Maze , so may be little too busy. \nRory Kinnear, who also starred in the recent Bond films as M’s Chief of Staff, Bill Tanner, comes in third, while Miranda Hart is fourth. If Hart were to take the role, she would be the first female Doctor in the series.
