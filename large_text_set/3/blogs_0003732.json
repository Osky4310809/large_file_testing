I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers.” \nThen she spoke about violent protests , going into gruesome and specific detail. \n“It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals, who have made the difference,” she continued. “They’ve marched, they’ve bled and yes, some of them died.
