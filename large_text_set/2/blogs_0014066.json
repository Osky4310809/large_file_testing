I am very much focused on Monaco and (the City) game.\" \nMonaco have a burgeoning reputation having put themselves in pole position for the French title on the back of some exhilarating attacking football. \nThey lead Ligue 1 by three points from Paris St Germain having scored 76 goals in 26 games. \nRadamel Falcao, who failed to make an impact in loan spells at Manchester United and Chelsea, has been more like his old self with 19 goals to his name for the campaign.

I can imagine why he would want to convey that message, but we have seen what they are capable of and it will not be easy to stop them. \n\"But, with our strength and qualities, we will be looking to put on a good performance. \n\"We are in good shape, physically, and we are going to do our utmost to win the game.\" poll loading Who will reach the last eight? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:58:13.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
