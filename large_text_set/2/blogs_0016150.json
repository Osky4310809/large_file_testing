Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMillionaire Manchester United star Phil Jones has sacked a married pair of cleaners over a £300 bill, it has been reported. \nAngela and Nigel Stubbs are said to be taking the footballer to an employment tribunal after being sacked from their £23,400-a-year jobs with six hours' notice before Christmas. \nThey say they claimed the petrol costs for helping the footballer over a period of fortnight move his belongings with fiancee Kaya Hall into a new £5 million pad. \nThe move is said to have included six trips a day between the £20 million star's old home in Bowdon, Cheshire, to the new place in Alderley Edge. \nBut Jones has reportedly denied the claims - saying they breached their contracts by asking for wages in advance.
