January 1st 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/A-League/ Was Brattan concussed? \nThis has led Rudan to call on the governing body to clarify what happened and make clear the policy surrounding potential concussion. \n“There certainly needs to be some form of clarification from the FFA on this,” Rudan said on Fox Sports’ Matchday Sunday. \n“We’ve spoken about head injuries before and it’s a serious, serious issue in our game. I was surprised when Glen reported the independent doctor said he was not fit enough to play. \n“Every player … wants to continue to play and Luke Brattan is the same, but if [the doctor] deems it impossible to go back on because of the concussion rule, and it is a FIFA rule, they have to overrule the any coach, any player, any referee, anyone. media_camera Brattan receives treatment after a knock to the head. \n“I’m surprised and it needs to go to the top. The FFA have to get their fingers out and get their people out to all the clubs and make that message loud and clear.” \nFFA’s Concussion Guidelines state: “any athlete with a suspected concussion should be immediately removed from play, and should not be returned to activity until they are assessed by a qualified medical practitioner.” \nIt adds: “Only qualified medical practitioners should diagnose whether a concussion has occurred, or provide advice as to whether the player can return to play.” \nThis contradicts sideline reports, which implied the independent doctor was against Brattan returning. \nCity coach John van `t Schip said Brattan would not have returned to the pitch had he not been well enough to do so. \n“They decided he could continue and Lukey himself said he was okay, so that’s why he stayed on,” van `t Schip said.
