According to 'The Big Guy', the triumvirate was looking for a move they could all perform together that would believably K.O. the former Skip Sheffield. \n\"They needed a move, I remember, to put me down early on. I think it was that first the pay-per-view before in Indianapolis, the triple threat [match] with me, [John] Cena, and [CM] Punk. And I had been powerbombing a lot of guys up till that point in different variations of powerbombs. And I said to them, 'why don't you do a triple powerbomb?' because they wanted a move they all three could could do.\" See Also Ryback On What's In Vince McMahon's Suitcase, John Cena Stripping In A Bowling Alley, Losing Singlet \nRyback went on to muse that he regrets coming up with the move, as he was on the receiving end of more triple powerbombs than anyone else at that time. \n\"Goddamnit did I regret ever f--king saying that because I received more triple powerbombs than anybody on the roster at that point. And they were all fine, but they triple powerbombed me through the table at the end of that one. And then, they did it in the match at TLC.\" \nClick here to check out the podcast.
