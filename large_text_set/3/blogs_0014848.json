It had been thought Wenger would walk if Arsenal missed out on the top four, but... (Photo: Getty) \nThe Germany international midfielder trained on Friday, but then did not travel for the next day's defeat at West Brom because Wenger said he had a “hamstring” injury. \nArsenal players were not sure from the final training session, when they practise team shape, as to whether Ozil would have started at the Hawthorns. \nBut the 28-year-old is still expected to report for international duty, including Wednesday’s friendly with England in Dortmund.

Four defeats in five league games have Arsenal sitting sixth with 11 matches to go (Photo: REUTERS) \nArsenal know that if Wenger does sign a new two-year deal, they will have to get the timing of the announcement right — especially if Ozil and Sanchez are sold. \nMirror Sport understands the 67-year-old retains the support of the dressing room, but there is concern about the uncertainty of his future coupled with rock-bottom confidence after poor recent results. \nThere was a belief that Wenger would go if the Gunners missed out on qualification for next season's Champions League, but that is no longer necessarily the case.
