The picture was posted by a Toronto-based South-Asian bridal magazine, JODI, as a lead-up to their new issue. Obviously, all hell broke loose because showing skin=unholy and brides=sacred. Here’s what the high guards of womanly etiquettes had to say. \nOf course, most haters called out the picture for a wrongful depiction of Tamilian culture. Some argued that brides don’t dress so provocatively on their wedding day. \nThe photographer, Vipoositha Gnanenthra of Ovyian Photography, in a statement to Now Toronto, said, “My job is to reinvigorate interest in saris. The sari is a piece of cloth. You can wear it any which way. It’s evolved for so many years because it was so versatile. It kept up with changing times.” \nThe model in question, Thanuska Subramaniam, also expressed disappointment on knowing about the negative reactions. She said, “There is so much Tamil female talent that was behind this cover. It’s sad that all those people who had negative things to say about the cover, didn’t want to acknowledge that aspect behind it. People should be proud of that. They should encourage that.” \nSeriously, though, whatever happened to editorial liberties?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T12:03:00.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
