Karimu Bashiru, had earlier told the court that one Mercy Amadi reported the case to Anglo Jos Police Station on Jan. 30. \nHe said that Amadi claimed to have been deceived by the accused who lied to her that she (accused) was awarded a contract to knit 400 pieces of mobile policemen sweater. \n”She collected N100, 000 and promised that she would return the money with 100 per cent interest,” the prosecutor quoted the complainant as saying. \nBashiru said that instead of returning the money as agreed, the accused converted the whole money into her personnel use and all effort made to recover the money proved abortive. \nHe said that the offence was punishable under section 317 and 322 of the penal code.
