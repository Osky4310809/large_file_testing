To go along with the announcement, the German automaker released this image that shows us the compact SUV’s new face. \nNew LED headlamps are part of this new look, like those gained by the facelifted A-Class and CLA previously. Elsewhere, there is a new front bumper with fog lamps, as well as a new interpretation of the brand’s Three Pointed Star, which is a lot more minimalistic in its design. \nThe new badge could hide a series of sensors that are used for an expanded driver assistance and safety system suite. A new grille is also seen here that retains the dual-slat appearance, albeit with rectangular elements on them. Unchanged here is the bonnet, which still has the “power bulges” on them. \nAs for other areas not shown to us, previous spyshots have revealed that a redesigned rear bumper and new LED taillights will be part of the update. The interior meanwhile, will assimilate certain items from the C-Class, with a new steering wheel, switchgear and instrument cluster being among the changes. \nThe M 270 DE 20 2.0 litre four-cylinder petrol engine will likely make its way into the GLA 250, providing 218 hp (from 211 hp), with torque output remaining at 350 Nm. The range-topping AMG model – the GLA 45, should get the same power boost as the latest A 45 and CLA 45 , with 381 hp and 475 Nm made available from the M133 mill. \nThe new GLA is expected to arrive in Malaysia by mid-2017 , as we’ve been told by Mercedes-Benz Malaysia vice president of sales and marketing, Mark Raine, during a presentation of Mercedes-Benz Malaysia’s 3Q2016 sales results . That is just five months after it makes its global debut.
