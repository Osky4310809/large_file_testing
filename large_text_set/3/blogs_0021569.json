Daniel Akpeyi \nBut all hope is not lost as the officials at the embassy claimed that the travelling document is read but he can only pick it up the next working day. \nToday is a very important public holiday in South Africa, the Human Rights Day, which commemorates the establishment of the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), and it is thought that the British High Commission will observe the holiday of their host country. \nIf that is the case, the earliest date Akpeyi will see the endorsement on his Nigerian passport is March 22, a day before the Nigeria squad faces Senegal in their first game of 2017. \nOf the three invited goalkeepers, only Wolverhampton Wanderers star Carl Ikeme was in camp as at the time of this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:02:13.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
