Pointing its knife at the heart of the hybrid segment, the Korean brand is bringing the Niro to market with a starting price of $23,785, or $1765 less than the least expensive Prius. \n-The most fuel-efficient of the Niro’s five trim levels is the base FE, which is EPA rated at 52 mpg city and 49 mpg highway. The Niro FE comes standard with a rearview camera, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto.\n- \n-Those willing to accept a fuel-economy hit of 1 mpg city and 3 mpg highway in the name of convenience will want to check out the better-equipped LX and EX, which start at $24,095 and $26,595. The Niro LX adds roof rails, push-button start, and LED taillights to the features list, while the higher-end EX embellishes the package with heated seats, LED daytime running lights, fog lamps, a blind-spot monitoring system, and heated power-folding side mirrors. A forward-collision warning system, automated emergency braking, and lane-departure warning can be added at a cost of $1450 on the LX and $2300 on the EX. On the latter, the safety systems are packaged with a power sunroof and adaptive cruise control.\n- \n-Atop the Niro’s empire is the Touring model, wearing EPA ratings of 46 mpg city and 40 mpg highway. Starting at $30,545, the Touring includes a plethora of luxury items including a sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and a power driver’s seat. Consumers can add forward-collision warning, automated emergency braking, lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and HID headlights to the top-line trim for $1900. Finally, early Niro buyers can get their hands on the limited-production Launch Edition, which is limited to two colors (white and black) and includes a model-specific grille and 18-inch wheels. It can be had for $28,895.\n- - 2017 Kia Niro Driven! - Electric Invasion: Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid & EV Go on Sale in Late 2016, Plug-In in 2017 - Kia Niro Full Coverage: News, Photos, Specs, Reviews, and More - -While the Niro may have the edge on content for price, it trails the mother of all hybrids in fuel economy; the 2017 Prius is EPA rated at 54 mpg city and 50 mpg highway. As Nero himself learned, the first stab at killing one’s progenitor doesn’t always succeed.\n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:09:25.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
