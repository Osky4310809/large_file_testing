Comment IMAGE Alexa Miller \nHuge emphasis on \"probably.\" Every penis is different and everyone reacts differently, so there's no guarantee these things won't push him over the edge. Some guys will climax from a stiff breeze and others take a lot more coaxing. But if you're trying to make him feel good without ending things too early, there are a few things you can try. 1. Using just your tongue during a blow job. If he's extra-sensitive, licking up and down his shaft or head of his penis can drive him nuts (sorry). 2. Playing with his nipples. Some guys hate this. Don't just saunter on up to your dude's tatas, mouth agape like everything is fine. Work up to it, and if he's not into it, he'll let you know. But if he likes it, you can tease him without worrying that his penis will wind up tapping out early. 3. Giving each other intimate massages. Get naked, grab some oil, mentally prepare yourself to wash your sheets afterward, and rub up on each other. It's sexy, it's fun, it feels good. And it probably won't be enough for him to orgasm. 4. Trying his, like, sixth-favorite sex position for a while. It's entirely possible he has a sex position or two that isn't his ultimate, gets-him-there-every-time move. Maybe it's the angle or a position where he can't control the pace as easily. Whatever it is, if you're into it, try it for a few minutes to start; it'll still feel great (come on, it's sex), but you can hump away without worrying that he'll finish before you.
