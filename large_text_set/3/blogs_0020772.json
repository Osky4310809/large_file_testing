Users can also create animated captions and titles by voice command with what is called Live Titles. Videos can be further livened up by fun effects including comic book filters, speech bubbles, shapes and full-screen animated posters.\n“Clips gives iPhone and iPad users a new way to express themselves through video, and it’s incredibly easy to use,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Apps Product Marketing. “The effects, filters and amazing new Live Titles we’ve designed for Clips let anyone make great-looking, easily sharable videos with just a few taps.”\nMulti-clip videos can ultimately be created without timelines, as you can shoot live video and photos or simply add them from your library. Then, you can apply the aforementioned animated effects to further enhance and customize the aesthetic.\nClips will be available in the App Store for free beginning in April.\nAlso worthy of note, Apple just unveiled a red iPhone 7 that you can buy this week.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:21:02.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
