At least that’s where Amazon is placing another e-commerce bet.\nThe online retailer launched a STEM toy subscription club Tuesday that will deliver science, technology, engineering and math toys to your door every month. The $19.99-per-month subscription promises top-quality toys that will be hand-picked by “toy experts.”\nThe toys will range from robotics to natural sciences and will include items exclusive to Amazon. Parents will be able to choose an age range — 3-4, 5-7 or 8-13 — to ensure the toys will be appropriate for their child.\nThe goal, Amazon writes, is to make “it more convenient than ever for parents to give their kids the gift of having fun while learning.”\nAmazon has long capitalized on the STEM toy market, having launched its STEM Toys & Games Store in 2015. The newest “STEM Club” appears to pull items from that shop, so that “customers can rest assured knowing they are receiving the best STEM toys for their young learners.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:09:23.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
