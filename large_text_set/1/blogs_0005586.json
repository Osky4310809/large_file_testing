I am originally from Savannah, and I remember Armstrong, so that is just super dope.” \nThe course is slated to start this spring and naturally, is already full. \nThis isn’t the first Hip Hop course to make its way into the college classroom. Rice University employed an online “Religion and Hip-Hop Culture” course in 2015 and Bun B was even a working professor on campus in 2013. UC Berkeley also launched their own dedicated Hip Hop course focused on Tupac in 2008 . Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
