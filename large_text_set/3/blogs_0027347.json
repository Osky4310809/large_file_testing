No such steps have been taken during the reporting period,\" he said. \nSpeaking to reporters, Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour said: \"Settlements need to be stopped, not only because they are illegal, but they are the main obstacle in the path of the two-state solution.\" READ MORE: UN report decries Israeli settlements' 'alarming pace' \nThe UNSC Resolution 2334, which reaffirmed long-standing positions of the international community, was adopted with 14 votes after the United States abstained in the vote . \nThe abstention defied pressure from then President-elect Donald Trump, Israel and some US politicians who urged Washington to wield its veto. \nThe resolution condemned Israel's settlements on Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, saying they had \"no legal validity\". \nIt also demanded a halt to \"all Israeli settlement activities\", saying this \"is essential for salvaging the two-state solution\". OPINION: What did the UN apartheid report expose in reality? \nIsraeli settlements are seen as a major stumbling block to peace efforts as they are built on land the Palestinians see as part of their future state. \nMuch of the international community has raised increasing alarm over settlement expansion, saying it is gradually eating away at prospects for a two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nThe United Nations maintains that settlements are illegal, but UN officials have reported a surge in construction over the past months. \nMladenov called \"the January spike\" in illegal settlement announcements by Israel \"deeply concerning.\" During that month, he said, two major announcements were made for a total of 5,500 housing units in Area C, the 60 percent of the West Bank exclusively controlled by Israel. \n\"Overall, the last three months have seen a high rate of settlement-related activity, especially when compared to 2016, which saw tenders for only 42 (housing) units issued and some 3,000 units advanced over 12 months in Area C,\" Mladenov said. \nLast year, Israel built 2,630 illegal settler homes in the occupied West Bank in 2016, an increase of 40 percent compared with numbers from 2015. \nSome 430,000 Israeli settlers currently live in the West Bank and a further 200,000 Israelis live in occupied East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians see as the capital of their future state.
