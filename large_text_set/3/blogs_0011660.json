Photo: Apple \nIf you’ve purchased a new iPhone in the last 12 months but failed to buy AppleCare+ to protect it, Apple is ready to cut you a break. \nApple has decided to extend the period in which iPhone buyers can get AppleCare+ to one full year from the data of purchase, after previously only letting you buy it within 60 days. \nThe new change in policy brings the iPhone’s AppleCare+ options in line with other devices like the Apple TV and Mac. Apple hasn’t officially updated its AppleCare+ website to reflect the changes, but a senior support rep confirmed them to MacRumors . \nAccording to the report, the new extension only applies on the iPhone. Owners of the iPad and Apple Watch still have to buy AppleCare+ within the first 60 days. The change is retro-active and applies to all iPhones purchased in the last year. AppleCare+ extends the warranty on devices from one year to two years. Coverage for most new iPhones cost $129 while AppleCare+ on the iPhone SE is only $99. Along with the extended warranty, AppleCare+ customers get two incidents of accidental damage coverage. Screen replacements cost $29 and full device replacements cost $99. \nIf you do want to buy AppleCare+ on your new iPhone, all you have to do is take the device into an Apple store for inspection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T03:04:49.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
