But let's see how this year goes first.\" It's not trying to compete with T in the Park, it's just different Geoff Ellis TRNSMT organiser \nThere has been a T in the Park in Scotland every year for more than two decades, but an enforced site move to Strathallan Castle in 2015 caused organisers problems. \nThey faced trouble with transport links, stage layout, planning permission and - bizarrely - rare birds' nests. \nLast year they announced there would be no T in the Park in 2017. \nNow TRNSMT has appeared, but Geoff thinks the two could complement each other. Image caption Biffy Clyro are one of the headliners at the first ever TRNSMT festival \n\"Obviously we wouldn't want to run them on the same weekend, but there's a big overlap in appeal and the two are very separate as well. \n\"To me TRNSMT works if you just want to go for one day, because, say, you're a big fan of Radiohead, then you can do that. But if you like the music across all three days you can do that too. \n\"And the beauty of a city centre festival is that if you like you can just show up at five o'clock, while other people will show up as soon as the gates open. \n\"It's very different to a rural camping festival. It's not trying to compete with one, it's just different.\" Image caption Radio 1's Big Weekend was held at Glasgow Green in 2014 \nGeoff says he's frustrated with the problems T in the Park has faced, but they're \"water under the bridge\" now. \n\"The restraints that were put on us both financially and in terms of audience experience at Strathallan Castle were incredibly frustrating - and that's why we've taken time out to fix them. \n\"But right now we're just excited again about launching a new music festival.\" \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:01:17.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
