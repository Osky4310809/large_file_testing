My hope is that it won’t,” Republican Senator Mike Lee told CNN. \n“My hope is that we can achieve whatever objectives the president’s willing to pursue in a way that won’t damage the trade relationship or won’t damage other aspects of our relationship,” Lee said. \nRepresentative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives, urged Trump to apologize, while Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he called Australia ‘s U.S. ambassador to express his support. \nDuring former President Barack Obama’s administration, the United States agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in offshore processing camps on Pacific islands in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. In return, Australia would resettle refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. \nThe rift between Washington and Canberra that has developed over the resettlement deal could have serious repercussions. Australia and the United States are among five nations that make up the Five Eyes group, the world’s leading intelligence-sharing network. \nLater on Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House he would “respect” the refugee agreement with Australia . \nBut Trump made it clear he was not pleased, saying it was an example of countries taking advantage of the United States. \n“Why are we doing this, what’s the purpose? So, we’ll see what happens,” Trump said. \nRefugees at issue \nThe call between Trump and Turnbull came at the end of a day of widespread protests and confusion over Trump ‘s order for a 120-day halt of the U.S. refugee program and a 90-day suspension on visits from people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. \nMany of the people being held in the Australia n detention centers, which have drawn harsh criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups, fled violence in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran. \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was “unbelievably disappointed” and “extremely, extremely upset” with the deal, but said it would go ahead. \nSpicer said all refugees presented to the United States would be subject to “extreme vetting” to ensure they do not pose security risks. \nTurnbull told reporters he was surprised and disappointed that details of the call with Trump had been leaked but gave few particulars other than to deny reports Trump had hung up on him. \n“As far as the call is concerned, the report that the president hung up is not correct. The call ended courteously. And as far as the nature of the discussion, it was very frank and forthright,” he told a Sydney radio station on Thursday. \nUnprecedented acrimony \nAustralia n Ambassador to the U.S. Joe Hockey had a “productive meeting” with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and top strategist Steve Bannon on Thursday, a White House official said, adding the men had conveyed Trump ‘s “deep admiration for the Australia n people” during the meeting. \nPolitical analysts said the acrimony between the two countries was unprecedented , surpassing even the difficult relations between former U.S. President Richard Nixon and then- Australia n Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, who withdrew the country’s troops during the Vietnam War. \n“Even that was always done in the language of foreign policy niceties,” said Harry Phillips, a political analyst of 40 years experience at Edith Cowan and Curtin universities in Perth. \nFor more news from Australia, watch Fortune ‘s video: \n\nAustralia , New Zealand and the United States have been allies under a formal security treaty since 1951. They co-operate on military matters in the Pacific region, although today the treaty is taken to relate to conflicts worldwide. \nThe United States plans to send extra military aircraft to Australia ‘s tropical north this year as part of a U.S. Marines deployment that will bolster its military presence close to the disputed South China Sea. \nAustralia is also one of 10 U.S. allies purchasing Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet program.
