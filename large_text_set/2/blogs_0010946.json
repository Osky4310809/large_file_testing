A former prosecutor, Orlando Figueira, who was arrested a year ago, had been charged with receiving 760,000 euros bribe (810,000 dollars) to shelve an investigation into Vicente’s dealings in Portugal before he became vice president. The Angolan vice president’s office had no immediate comment. \nAngola had branded previous attempts by Portugal to investigate Vicente as “revenge by former colonial master” and “neo-colonialism”. \nTwo of Vicente’s legal and financial representatives, Paulo Blanco and Armindo Pires, both Portuguese, were also charged with corruption and money laundering for allegedly paying the bribe jointly with Vicente and arranging a job in a bank as a favour for Figueira. \nThe media was, however, unable to reach them for comment but the vice president’s office said “the former prosecutor ruled in favour of the chief executive of the Angolan company in two investigations, both of which were ultimately shelved by the prosecutor.” \nLocal media said the probe that was shelved in January 2012 focused on the origin of funds with which Vicente bought a luxury apartment in Lisbon.
