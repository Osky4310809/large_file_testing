Billy the AWOL vicar Shouldn't you be at mass? \nHe may have doubts over his role in the church, but Billy could have at least made an appearance at mass on Christmas Day. \nInstead, he was knocking back pints with boyfriend Sean at the Rovers Return. \nWe dread to think how long the congregation were kept waiting before realising the vicar wasn't planning on turning up. \nOne fan laughed: \"Billy is the only vicar that spends Christmas day in the pub with his boyfriend drinking chinzano. It want that long ago he told Sean they couldn't go away at xmas at that was his busiest period. Busy? He doesn't seem to have done anything work related\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Where did Tyrone get the cash from? Did Tyrone secretly win the lottery? \nRemember when Tyrone transformed Weatherfield into Lapland for Hope and Ruby? \nHis bank balance certainly will after forking out on two dozen Christmas trees and a snow machine. \nThose tuning in at home couldn't help but question how much all the trimmings would have cost the mechanic. He also would have had to get permission from the council to close off the street. \n\"Surely even Fiz is not that stupid not to question the expense Tyrone has gone to over Christmas and wouldn't go ahead planning a ridiculously expensive wedding on top of all that,\" commented one fan. \nOops!

Come again, Norris? Norris told a few porkies (Photo: Coronation Street) \nNorris complained to Kevin and Tim that \"you'll never get an ambulance on Christmas Day; not for love nor money\". \nClearly someone's memory must be a little fuzzy because an ambulance arrived in minutes when he needed one on Christmas Day in 2002 after he had a fall. \nThere's also the very well known fact that emergency services never close, as one viewer pointed out: \"What Norris said was complete rubbish anyway, things don't just stand still because its Christmas!\" \n\"Dial 999: 'Thank you for calling the emergency services. we are now closed until january the 4th.' Who the hell writes these scripts?\" Ken the hypocrite Was Ken too harsh on Tracy? (Photo: ITV) \nWeatherfield legend Ken chucked his daughter Tracy out on the streets after discovering she had been cheating on Rob. \nThose tuning in at home thought that was a little dramatic - particularly as he is \"two-timing scumbag\" himself, \nDuring his marriage to Deirdre, Ken infamously had an affair with Martha. After his beloved wife passed away last year, he also wasted no time in moving on with Nessa. \nPot, kettle, black?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:55:48.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
