Well, one Delaware mom is doing an amazing job raising sons who are kind AND really making a difference. \nLast month, Sandra Daniel’s sons, 6-year-old Bradley and 4-year-old Brady, made lunches and personally delivered each to the homeless living in Philadelphia. \nWhen his parents surprised them with tickets to the circus in Philadelphia, Bradley asked if while they’re in town, he and his brother could feed the homeless. Of course Sandra obliged to the generous offer, but assumed the boys just wanted to bring snack bags. They had a much bigger idea in mind. Each bag would contain a PB&J sandwich, apples, pretzels, cookies, and three napkins — all the boys’ idea! image source: Sandra Daniel \nBoth kids were adamant about being involved in every part of the process. They helped make the sandwiches, pack the meals up, and walk them over to the homeless they found in Philly. With their parents nearby, both boys gently walked up to each person and handed them a bag. \n“People were so touched because they weren’t expecting lunch, especially from two little boys,” Sandra tells Babble. It certainly helped that both Bradley and Brady are confident kids and don’t have a problem approaching new people. “My boys are not shy at all, so they just kinda go for it,” Sandra says. \nIt gets even more adorable! \nOne homeless man in particular was especially moved by the boys’ efforts. After handing him a lunch bag, Bradley walked back up to his mom and turned around to see the man with sandwich crumbs on his chest, lovingly rubbing a smile sticker Bradley had placed on the bag. He then folded the bag up and put it in his backpack. \n“Bradley said, ‘Mommy, I want to give him another one. He looks like he needs it, and he can save it for later,’” Sandra shares with Babble. Bradley immediately ran over and gave the man an extra sandwich! image source: Sandra Daniel \nThe smile stickers are a tradition for this family. Each year, they stick them on care packages they take to kids at the hospital where Bradley was treated as a baby. He was born early and experienced many medical complications as a newborn, to the point where his doctors were baffled as to how he was still alive. “They called him Superman in the hospital,” Sandra tells Babble. \nBradley loves to hear his mom tell his Superman story over and over again. It may be what inspired him, and ultimately, his little brother, to become superheroes for the community around them. \nThis isn’t the first time the boys have helped the homeless. They’ve been handing out water and snacks to people at stoplights for the past few years. And it’s not the last time they’ll be helping, either. Last week, they handed out dozens of PB&J lunches in Philly again. This week, they’ll be teaming up with local organization Code Purple to deliver meals to the homeless in their hometown and neighboring communities. \nAs they continue to help those in need, Sandra hopes to keep encouraging her sons to be kind to everyone they meet. \n“I want to teach them to respect everybody. No matter what situation anyone’s in, they’re still people with feelings,” Sandra tells Babble. \nWhen they grow up, both boys want to be doctors and feed the poor. Just recently they’ve also added “rock star” to the list. It can safely be said that these two kiddos are already rock stars. Bradley and Brady are inspiring kiddos (and adults) to remember kindness in every situation!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:09:48.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
