Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nRomelu Lukaku's refusal to sign a new contract is 'not an issue,' claims Everton 's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri. \nThe Toffees now face a tough task of holding on to the Belgian striker, who is the joint-top goalscorer in the Premier League alongside Harry Kane with 19 goals. \nDespite agent Mino Raiola claiming recently that Lukaku was more than 99 percent sure to sign a new contract at Goodison Park, reports suggested on Tuesday that the 23-year-old informed the club he would do no such thing. \nMoshiri has moved to allay fears Evertonians may have about their star man leaving, reaffirming the club's excellent relationship with both the player and his representative. \n\"It's not an issue. We have a strong relationship with the player and agent,\" Moshiri told Sky Sports' Jim White. \n\"No-one should worry, he's our player.\" The striker now looks set to leave Goodison Park (Photo: Everton FC via Getty Images) \nRaiola has repeatedly said the former Chelsea star would put pen to paper on lucrative new terms soon, which would have made him the top earner in the club's history, report the Liverpool Echo. \nBut over the weekend it became clear the Belgium international was in fact not as close to an agreement as had been believed. \nAfter Saturday's 3-0 win over West Brom he told French TV that signing a new deal was not on his mind. Lukaku bagged another brace against West Brom (Photo: Getty) \nNow it has emerged that Lukaku, the Premier League's joint top goalscorer, has decided his future lies away from Goodison Park and won't commit to a new five-year contract.
