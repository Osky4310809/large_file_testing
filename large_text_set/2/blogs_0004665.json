It can, however, claim a new trim option for two of its models, the Cayenne S and the Cayenne S diesel. The Platinum Edition designation, already available on the base diesel and the S E-Hybrid , is expanding to offer even more choices for a lineup that’s already packed with a wide variety of flavors.\n- \n-According to Porsche, the Platinum Editions are intended to maximize sporty functionality, which is kind of already the whole purpose of the Cayenne, but we digress. They come standard with 21-inch Platinum satin-finish Sport Edition wheels, eight-way leather sport seats with microsuede centers that were previously only available on the GTS trim, rear privacy glass, body-color wheel-arch extensions, high-gloss black accents, and Platinum Edition labeling on the front doorsills. They also come equipped with Porsche’s bixenon headlights with the Porsche Dynamic Light System, Power Steering Plus, rear parking assist, and auto-dimming interior and exterior mirrors. Platinum buyers get to choose among five metallic paint options, as well: Jet Black, Mahogany, Purpurite , Carrara White, and Rhodium Silver.\n- - Make Ours Purpurite: Porsche Announces Cayenne Platinum Editions - First Drive: 2016 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S - Porsche Cayenne: Full Info, Specs, Reviews, Pricing, Photos, and More - -Platinum does not equate to power, however, as the S retains its 414-hp twin-turbo six-cylinder, and the S diesel keeps its 380-hp twin-turbo V-8 diesel. The S is listed for $94,290, and the S diesel will cost $97,498. Neither of these are coming to America, where, so far, only the base gas V-6 Cayenne and the S E-Hybrid have gone Platinum.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:50:10.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
