Below are some of her best moments from 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show'.

(Photo: Ann Heisenfelt, AP) \nLove is all around — and all over TV — to celebrate the life of entertainment great Mary Tyler Moore. \nWhether you're a longtime fan of the comedic icon and generational role model or just getting acquainted, there will be plenty of opportunities to reflect on her life and career with biographical specials and episodic tributes — Mary-thons, if you will — in the coming days. \nThe groundbreaking Moore, who starred in The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show and earned an Oscar nomination for Ordinary People , died Wednesday at the age of 80. She also became an influential TV producer, as her MTM Enterprises was responsible for a string of critically acclaimed hits, including Mary , The Bob Newhart Show , Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere , that helped elevate the creative bar in television. Appreciation: Yes, Mary Tyler Moore really did turn the world on with her smile \nCBS kicks off the festivities Thursday (9 ET/PT) with Mary Tyler Moore: Love Is All Around , a CBS News special hosted by Gayle King. \nThe one-hour program will delve into the archives of CBS, the network home of both legendary sitcoms, and include interviews with famous admirers who discuss Moore's acting and comedic skills and her pioneering influence as Mary Richards, a single working woman who became a role model for so many when Mary premiered in 1970. \n. \nThe 'Mary Tyler Moore' cast, seen together in a 1975 set photo.

The collection of 24 half-hour episodes includes some gems, including Mary's date with boss Lou Grant (Edward Asner), not exactly a match made in heaven, and the classic finale. You'll never think of It's a Long Way From Tipperary the same again — that is, if you had thought of it at all. \nAlso, keep your eyes peeled — as in, check local listings — for a PBS rebroadcast of 2015's Mary Tyler Moore: A Celebration , which includes interviews with Dick Van Dyke, Betty White, Valerie Harper and many other friends and colleagues of Moore. Ed Asner says Mary Tyler Moore had spunk, and this time he liked it \nMeTV, the broadcast network that focuses on boomer-era comedies and dramas, will present six Mary classics on Sunday starting at 2 p.m. ET/PT (MeTV regularly runs Mary episodes Sunday nights at 1 a.m.ET/PT). \nEpisodes include the series pilot, \"Love Is All Around,\" which features newsroom boss Lou Grant's famous \"You've got spunk — I hate spunk\" headspinner; Season 3's \"Put on a Happy Face,\" in which an awards celebration goes oh-so-wrong for Mary; Season 4's \"The Dinner Party,\" a standout even among Mary's legendarily bad parties that introduces both Veal Prince Orloff and a young Henry Winkler; \"Chuckles Bites the Dust,\" which includes what's perhaps the show's most hilarious scene, with a master class in acting by Moore; and Season 7's \"Lou Dates Mary.\" \nThe tribute closes with the series finale, which concludes with TV's most beloved group hug. \nWe probably all could use one of those right now. 271 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k7XkSU NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
