As a result, he went on to run for the office and eventually win. \n“Since the purpose of the challenge was primarily to stop him from being a candidate in that election, the challengers either voluntarily withdrew or abandoned the cases soon after he won and all of them were subsequently struck off by the courts. \n“The President has no certificate case hanging on his neck. The Punch editors should kindly update their records to avoid making this repeated mistake,” he stated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:44:06.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
