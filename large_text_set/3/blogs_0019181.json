Our friends at Autonetmagz.com have managed to get their hands on a leaked copy of the specifications, showing the new elements that will find their way on. \nThe big news is the introduction of the 1.2 litre 3NR-FE four-cylinder engine for the car. The mill, which is seen on the Toyota Calya (and Daihatsu Sigra ) in the republic, develops 80 PS and 104 Nm in its non-VVT-i form, and 88 PS and 108 Nm in its Dual VVT-i variation. \nBoth the Agya and Ayla will continue with the existing 1.0 litre 1KR-FE three-cylinder mill (on the Daihatsu, known as the D26F), which has 65 hp and 87 Nm for output numbers. Drivetrain choices should remain untouched, a five-speed manual and four-speed auto being the available units. \nThe Agya is currently available in three variant forms, the medium Grade E, high Grade G and the TRD S, and that looks to carry on unchanged. \nAll but one of the listed items in the leaked image concern exterior embellishments, led by new smoked projector headlights, complete with a LED guide strip and an auto cut-off feature. New LED rear lights are standard across the range, and aside from the Type E, the Agya range will get a new side mirror assembly, complete with turn signal lights. \nModels equipped with the 1.2 litre engine will be equipped with a new 14-inch alloy wheel as well as a new two-DIN audio head unit, which features Bluetooth. Finally, the range-topping TRD S variant will get a new aerokit (front and rear splitters, as well as side skirts) as part of the revision work. \nNo referencing as to whether all these changes will find their way on to the Ayla, which is available in the republic in three trim levels, the entry-level Type D, medium specification Type M and range-topping Type X. \nJudging by the presence of the brochure, the Agya facelift will be unveiled soon, and it’s very likely that it will make its debut at the event where it was first introduced, the IIMS – the 2017 edition of the show takes place next month.
