Hyeri also attended the event, which featured a gathering of Hawaii’s representative and local designers. \nIn the accompanying interview, Hyeri said, “In order to find a song that fits Girl’s Day, our hiatus has been long. All the members feel the burden of living up to the expectations of our long-suffering fans. We are taking the extra time to please our fans with the result, but since I know how they must feel to wait, I feel very sorry towards them. To a singer, to an actor, the worries about waiting for a song or production is the same.” \nHyeri also made some wishes for 2017. “I always say that I hope it’s like this past year,” she said. “I’m always happy with the present. I was happy in 2015 and 2016. I’m not greedy for a year even better than the last. To a personality without ambition, everything went well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T01:13:23.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
