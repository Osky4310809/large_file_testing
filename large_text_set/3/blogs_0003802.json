As you may remember, we have presented a comedy festival in our fair city each of the past three years, along with our friends at The Onion and ClickHole. Well, we’re doing it again, with help from our returning title sponsor truTV: Behold the fourth annual 26th Annual Comedy Festival. It will run from May 31 to June 4, 2017, at various venues around Chicago. \nPatton Oswalt will film his upcoming stand-up special at the Athenaeum on June 2. Mike Judge will screen a 35mm print of his amazingly prescient Idiocracy at the Music Box. Legendary actor-director Christopher Guest ( This Is Spinal Tap , Waiting For Guffman ) will appear in conversation with Robert Milazzo, also at the Music Box. Plus Nathan Fielder. Aparna Nancherla. Bitch Sesh. Guys We F@#ked: The Experience. ClickHole Live. Adam Ruins Everything Live. AND MORE. See below for all the details. \nSpecific information on tickets and stuff can be found on the festival’s site . For the first this this year, we’ll be offering an all-festival pass, but they’re very limited. Those are on sale now ; tickets for all other shows will go on sale this Friday, March 10, at noon central. Oh, and yes, there will be after parties every damn night at the Virgin Chicago, featuring superstar special guests. Now check out this lineup! \nChristopher Guest In Conversation Wednesday, May 31 / 7:00pm @ Music BoxLegendary actor and director Christopher Guest has been a part of some of the greatest comedy in the last 30+ years. He’s one-third of Spinal Tap. He’s Corky St. Clair in his own Waiting For Guffman . He directed the “synchronized swimmers” sketch on SNL, as well as A Mighty Wind , Mascots , and more. Here, Guest will have a conversation with The Modern School Of Film’s Robert Milazzo that will span his entire storied career, and will include clips from his work to help tell the story. \nAparna Nancherla Wednesday, May 31 / 7:00 & 10:00pm @ The HideoutAparna Nancherla is an incredibly funny stand-up who’s written for Late Night With Seth Meyers and appeared on Inside Amy Schumer . \nIdiocracy Screening with Writer/Director Mike Judge Thursday, June 1 / 7:00pm @ Music BoxMike Judge is the genius behind Beavis & Butt-head , Office Space , and King Of The Hill . His second feature film Idiocracy has proven to be incredibly prescient in these political times: 500 years in the future, the world has gotten very, very dumb. Here, Judge will screen a 35mm print of the film and then be interviewed by The A.V. Club ’s Sean O’Neal. \nThe Adventures Of Pete & Pete reunion Thursday, June 1 / 9:30pm @ Lincoln HallNickelodeon’s The Adventures Of Pete & Pete has been called the greatest children’s show ever, and it works just as well for adults. (Guest stars on the 1993-1996 series included Iggy Pop, Chris Elliott, LL Cool J, and Michael Stipe, among many others.) Join the cast and the show’s creators for an evening of obsessive reminiscing about all things Pete moderated by The A.V. Club ’s Marah Eakin. There will be a cast and crew panel discussion, an audience Q&A, classic clips, and much more. \nPatton Oswalt Friday, June 2 / 7:00 & 10:00pm @ Athenaeum TheatrePatton Oswalt probably needs no introduction at this point, right? One of the biggest and best stand-ups working today, he recently took home a Grammy for Best Comedy Album (for last year’s Talking For Clapping ). He’s also an incredible character actor, starring as everything from Remy in Ratatouille to Bob Sweeney on Justified and a thousand roles in between. At these can’t-miss shows, Oswalt will be recording a new TV special for the Chicago audiences that have welcomed him for many years. \nBitch Sesh live with Casey Wilson and Danielle Schneider Friday, June 2 / 7:00 & 9:30pm @ Lincoln HallCasey Wilson and Danielle Schneider ( Hotwives Of Las Vegas ) love the Real Housewives on Bravo, and they’re sharing that excitement with you on Bitch Sesh!

His life’s work has resulted in such indelible segments as “Dumb Starbucks” and the world-fooling “Petting Zoo Hero.” Expect the unexpected (as well as a sneak peek at season four). \nGuys We F@#ked: The Experience Saturday, June 3 / 7:00 & 10:00pm @ Thalia HallEach week, Corinne Fisher and Krystyna Hutchinson (together known as the comedy duo Sorry About Last Night) interview a gentleman they slept with on Guys We F@#ed: The Anti Slut Shaming Podcast. Some they made love to, some they had sex with a few times and some they f****d in a hotel bathroom... er, what? Corinne & Krystyna want to make the world a more sex-positive place, one candid story of intercourse at a time. \n7 Minutes In Purgatory with Ian Abramson Saturday, June 3 / 8:00pm @ Lincoln HallWhat happens when you deny stand-up comedians the benefit of laughter? Ian Abramson, host of 7 Minutes In Purgatory, finds out when he puts comics alone in while the audience watches from a different room. Last year’s show at the Hideout was sold out and crazy, so this year we’re moving it to a bigger room. \nClickHole Live Saturday, June 3 / 10:30pm @ Lincoln HallClickHole is The Onion ’s sister site, and it tackles the ridiculous world of viral sites with headlines like “16 Pictures Of Beyonce Where She’s Not Sinking In Quicksand” and “How Many Of These Hard-Line Negotiating Tactics Have You Used To Get The Best Price On A Sponge?” Live, things are just as weird, with the ClickHole writers taking turns getting strange on stage, with PowerPoint presentations, songs, and stand-up sets. \nCrabapples with Bobcat Goldthwait and Caitlin Gill Saturday, June 3 / 7:00 & 10:00pm @ The HideoutBobcat Goldthwait is one of the most recognizable comedians in show business and was ranked as the 61st greatest comedian of all time by Comedy Central. You might recognize him from the Police Academy movies, but we prefer to think of him as the stand-up master—and writer-director of the cult classic Shakes The Clown . Bobcat is also currently in production on a new series, Bobcat Goldthwait’s Messed Up Stories (working title), for truTV. He’ll be joined here for two shows by Caitlin Gill; the two host a regular stand-up showcase called Crabapples. \nAdam Ruins Everything Live Sunday, June 4 / 7 & 9:30pm @ Lincoln HallAdam Conover is the creator and star of truTV’s Adam Ruins Everything , a comedy series that dispels widespread misconceptions about everything we take for granted. Adam recurs on the hit Netflix animated series Bojack Horseman and was a regular panelist on VH1’s Best Week Ever . \nRise Up: Comedy For Change Friday, June 2-Sunday, June 4In conjunction with the comedy festival, we‘re presenting Rise Up: Comedy For Change from June 2-4. With support from The Open Society Foundations, the day-and-a-half event will bring together experts, change-makers, creatives, and comedians to explore the role comedy can play in creating social and political change in an increasingly polarized world. An opening reception will be held Friday, June 2; panels, performances, and debates will be held during the day on Saturday, June 3 and the morning of Sunday, June 4. \nAs part of the event, Caty Borum Chattoo, director of the Center for Media & Social Impact at American University (CMSI), will facilitate workshops for several satirists and comedians from the US and Latin America to create new comedy projects through media that will later be published on a Univision or Fusion Media Group platform later in the year. CMSI’s new project, The Laughter Effect, provides insights about how comedy works to create social change. \nYou made it this far!
