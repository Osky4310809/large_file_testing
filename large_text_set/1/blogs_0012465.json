He described the incident as “an unfortunate accident.”\nThe accident occurred about 7:30 p.m. at Jack London Square, near the jazz club Yoshi’s. The band was scheduled to perform at Yoshi’s on Thursday.\nThe concert was canceled, and Yoshi’s posted a statement to its social media accounts: “We are deeply affected by this event and share our prayers and thoughts to their families and the Bay Area music community as a whole.”\nTower of Power was founded in Oakland in 1968 as the Motowns, but the group later adopted the new name. Within the 10-person band, four have been members since the beginning, including Garibaldi.\nThis story will be updated as more information becomes available.\nCaption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Donald Trump's independent streak was on vivid display at Wednesday's news conference.
