For kicking back at the pad, an amplifier and various types of headphones are packaged in a slick metal box, while additional Bluetooth headphones come sheathed in either a calfskin storage clutch or backpack for scuff-free use on the go. For those looking to move a little lighter, yet another set of Bluetooth earphones are included, housed in a leather cover.\nThe collection arrives at select Dior Homme boutiques and Sennheiser stores worldwide at some point this spring. Look out for pricing news in the coming days.\nIn other tech news, hereâ€™s all the new emoji pictographs you can expect to see in June.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:40:28.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
