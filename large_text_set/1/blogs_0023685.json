This is yet another allegation in the Baylor sexual assault scandal that ended up costing Art Briles his job as Baylor head coach.\nAccording to The Dallas Morning News, the woman has sued for Title IX and negligence. The paper also reports the suit states that two gang rapes involved 10 or more players. There is also a line in the suit referencing former Baylor assistant coach Kendall Briles, Art’s son .\nThe lawsuit describes a culture of sexual violence within Baylor's athletics, in which the school implemented a \"show 'em a good time\" policy that \"used sex to sell\" the football program to recruits. A Dallas-area high school athlete, according to the suit, said former assistant coach Kendall Briles once asked him, \"Do you like white women? Because we have a lot of them at Baylor and they love football players.\"\nArt was fired as head coach of the Bears during the offseason when the scandal broke. Kendall spent much of 2016 with public shows of support for his father, paying tribute to him during the season opener and joining with other coaches on the staff to challenge the Baylor administration’s handling of the situation.\npic.twitter.com/9ogtsPhb6L \n— Coach KB (@kendalbriles) November 5, 2016 Details from the scandal show how Art, among others, passed the buck specifically involving an allegation from one woman of sexual assault, and how per athletic department policy he was not allowed to do so .\nKendall has recently been hired as an offensive coordinator by Lane Kiffin at FAU . Kiffin said he felt comfortable with Briles’ situation in a press conference before the Playoff semifinal .
