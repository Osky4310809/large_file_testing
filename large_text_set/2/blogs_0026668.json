By Bryan Kalbrosky February 23, 2017 8:23 pm ET 66 shares email By: Bryan Kalbrosky | February 23, 2017 8:23 pm ET \nNFL teams are not allowed to make official trades until March 9th. While we wait, ESPN is looking back at the best football trades ever. \nBelow are the results after over five thousand votes on ESPN.com . As you can see, the move for Faulk currently has the least total picks. \n\nHere’s what Alden Gonzalez said about the Faulk move in a recent summary ( via ESPN ): \n“The Rams acquired the dynamic Faulk in a move that helped spawn one of the greatest offenses in NFL history. They sent second- and fifth-round picks to the Colts for Faulk, who joined quarterback Kurt Warner and receivers Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt to form The Greatest Show on Turf — which won two NFC championships from 1999 to 2001 and claimed Super Bowl XXXIV over Jeff Fisher’s Titans. Faulk led the NFL with 2,429 yards from scrimmage in 1999 and won back-to-back MVPs in 2000 and ’01, a span that saw him score 47 touchdowns.” \nThe Rams were involved in many of the other trades listed in the recent breakdown of best moves by each team. \nIndianapolis received linebacker Mike Peterson, who played just four years for the Colts, and Brad Scioli. The latter, Scioli, recorded fifteen sacks in his six-year professional career.

For example, the best trade ever by the Pittsburgh Steelers was trading a second and fourth round pick to the Rams for a third rounder and Jerome Bettis. \nLikewise, the Colts landed Eric Dickerson for two players and six draft picks and the Eagles got quarterback Ron Jaworski for a tight end. \nEven the recent move for the Titans to land picks in the upcoming draft for Jared Goff was mentioned in the report.
