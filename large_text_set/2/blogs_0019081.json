Chad Huffman was the star player’s littlest brother. While others watched the game, the two kids, about 8 years old, watched each other. Together they stood before a fence that was 10 feet or 12 feet high, but was Everest in their eyes. One of them was going to get to the top first, and the other had to stop that from happening. \nThe competition never stopped. \n“He would say he won,” Carpenter said. “And I would say I did.” \n“As I remember it, I won, for sure, I think,” Huffman said. “That’s probably what we’re going to be saying for the rest of our lives. We’re going to be arguing about who won at something. He’s the one guy I love to beat and hate to be beaten by.” \nFor the first time as pros, the two boyhood friends (and friendly foes) are sharing a clubhouse this spring with the Cardinals. Carpenter is in the third year of a six-year, $52 million extension that, along with three All-Star Game berths, has cemented him as a cornerstone of the lineup. Huffman, 31, has chased baseball up and down the minors, through nine games in the majors in 2010, and even to Japan. He led the International League in OPS a year ago, and the Cardinals invited him to spring training to take a swing at being this year’s Jeremy Hazelbaker – the hitter who cannot be ignored in March and goes north for April. \nIf he reaches St. Louis, Huffman will have played with Carpenter as Texas kids on a Quail Valley Little League team, as teens at Elkins High, as stars at Texas Christian and, finally, more than a decade later in the majors. There may be no other duo that can compete with that. \n“He’s a great example of how you’ve got to be a good player, but you’ve got to be in the right place at the right time,” Carpenter said. “I’ve always considered him a better player than me. Three years we were together at TCU and he was the best hitter on our team, and it wasn’t even close. He just never really got a fair chance to stick.” \nThe Cardinals don’t have an obvious opening on their bench, though they do have several candidates they are open to finding a spot for. Tommy Pham, an incumbent, has to hold off several challengers. Jordan Schafer, a lefty reliever, is attempting to make the team as two-way option who could also serve as a fifth outfielder. Todd Cunningham had a .378 on-base percentage at Class AAA Salt Lake and has had cameos in the majors. Huffman, a first baseman and outfielder, returned from two seasons in Japan to slug .505 with 55 extra-base hits and a .892 OPS last summer. He has an .819 OPS at Class AAA. \nCarpenter has been the constant challenger in his life, yet it’s when Carpenter leaves for Team USA and the World Baseball Classic that at-bats and innings open for Huffman and the others to make their claim. \n“Look at Huffman, look at Cunningham — we brought them in for a purpose,” manager Mike Matheny said. “They can put on a show in all these drills and BPs, but it comes down to getting on the field and making the most of the opportunity. Like you said — a Hazelbaker is a great example. I didn’t know much about him except his bio and the back of his baseball card. Watch him play. Let that do all the speaking.” \nThe Cardinals knew a bit more about Huffman than his baseball card because of his connection to Carpenter and his turn with Class AAA Memphis in 2013. It was only a few offseasons before that Carpenter and his wife lived across the street from Huffman and his parents. Carpenter and Huffman would drive an hour to their workout facility on the other side of Houston and hour back home, carrying on like they had since they were scaling a fence. \nAt sleepovers, they would compete at everything, “like even who could race to the trashcan first,” Carpenter said. Carpenter’s father, Rick, was the head baseball coach at Elkins, where Huffman’s older brothers played and where both he and Carpenter would talk about playing. During one of his brother’s state championship games, Huffman went to the souvenir stand and bought two miniature bats and two miniature gloves. He gave a set to Carpenter. \nWhen Elkins was at the plate, they’d rub the bat. \nWhen Elkins was in the field, they’d rub the glove. \nWhen Elkins won the title and all the fans stormed the field, the two friends, around 10 at the time, found each other and promised: “We’re going to do this.” \nThey played together on state and national championship teams at Elkins. When Carpenter, a grade younger than Huffman, took an official recruiting visit to TCU, Huffman was his host. He talked him out of going to Texas. Huffman’s oldest brother, Royce, was one of TCU’s greatest players, and Chad was quickly on his way when Carpenter enrolled. When Carpenter graduated, the all-time career leaders in hits at TCU were Royce (317) and Carpenter and Chad tied at 263. The school’s MVP award is now named for Carpenter, though he only won it once. Chad won it twice. \n“Throughout my career he’s been there to push me. We push each other,” Huffman said. “We’re always trying to one-up each other or beat each other at something. That can’t help but make you better.” \nHuffman debuted with the Yankees in 2010 and has bounced around, roster to roster, spring to spring, continent to continent since. His stretch in Japan was lonely at times, but enriching when it came to the game and sharpening his approach at the plate. He can play both first and the corner outfield spots, and his righthanded swing has life but never an extended look in the majors. Carpenter made that climb. \nAfter a lifelong race, he can’t beat Carpenter. \nHe can join him. \n“Righthanded bat off the bench — there’s a place for that on this team,” Carpenter said. “I was fortunate enough to be in a situation that I had a chance. If Albert (Pujols) signs back, what happens? I think about that. I may not make this team in 2012. Right place, right time. You’ve got to take advantage. You’ve got to catch breaks. David Freese getting traded? You just never know. Opportunities come along. He had other options. But I told him you’re always one injury or one great camp away from having that chance, and that’s what he has.” \nDerrick Goold", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:31:25.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
