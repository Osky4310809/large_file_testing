But because of what happens in Iron Fist, he’s very untrusting. It’s really his way or no way. \nI see it as kind of this journey where Iron Fist and The Defenders is like the complete first season of Danny’s journey. Legion \nThe show will dance around David’s comic book connections to Charles Xavier, according to producer Lauren Shuler Donner: \nWe just don’t want to get into the Xavier world, because that’s not what this show is about. Probably the driving mystery is, yes, who is David? But not in that sense. It’s more, “Is David schizophrenic? Is he crazy? Or does he have powers?” That is the mystery. “Who is David?” \n[ IGN ] Timeless \nMisha Collins is set to guest-star on the February 13th episode as Elliot Ness, leader of the Untouchables and the only man capable of taking down the infamous Al Capone.

A Series of Unfortunate Events \nUnsurprisingly, Netflix has renewed the show for a second season. [ EW ] Stranger Things \nShawn Levy teases bigger stakes in store for season two: Advertisement Advertisement \nSeason 2 is bigger and potentially darker in its stakes. The threat, which in Season 1 was to Will Byers, has grown. That’s all I’m going to say! But, I will say Season 2 has a bigger cast and is definitely loyal to the kind of magical storytelling that we established in the first season. It’s character-based and still about our core group of characters. \nNow that we’ve done a season, we know exactly about our characters. We are very conscious of them and can take them to the next level. I think we’ve grown up a little bit, and our characters have too. They have been through a lot and have used those experiences to help them grow and to be stronger in Season 2. Riverdale \nJughead speaks!
