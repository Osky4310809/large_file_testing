Earlier this week, for example, former Clinton campaign chairman pointed the finger openly at the FBI. \n“There are at least forces within the FBI that wanted her to lose,” he said in a radio interview . “I’m not sure they really understood the alternative, but they wanted her to lose. I think that’s one possibility.” \nOf course, Podesta never examined why FBI agents wanted Hillary Clinton prosecuted, which is that she likely broke the law. In fact, to Democrats, Hillary Clinton is never responsible for any of the reasons Americans may dislike or oppose her.
