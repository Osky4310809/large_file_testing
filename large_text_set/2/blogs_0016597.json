Trump is dumb but lack of housing stock growth in Stockholm concentrates refugees in towns with with few jobs & it's a real problem. \n— Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) February 21, 2017 \nYeah, it’s a real problem that Sweden took in a bunch of people who act like thugs, but let’s blame homelessness and not an extreme ideology that empowers them to act in such a way. \nPsh, c’mon Sweden, just build some cheap housing, hand out some food stamps and put them on government-sponsored healthcare and the violence will stop. \n*eye roll* Refugees being homeless causes rape, rioting and a rise in crime in Sweden. Didn't they have homes in their own country? @PolitiBunny https://t.co/2ttZzTmvVY \n— Andrew Young (@NucMM1retired) February 21, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:51:41.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
