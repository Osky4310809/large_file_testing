I don’t know exactly how it’s normal here. Woodburn has made his Reds first-team bow this season (Photo: John Powell) \n“This should not be a criticism. But usually when you call up a player, a 17-year-old player, I thought it would be possible to call me. \n“I’m not sure if he (Coleman) knows him (Woodburn) well. He didn’t play in the team so far for Coleman I think.” \nAsked if he thought, because Woodburn is just 17, it would be better for Coleman to have made contact with Liverpool before calling him into the full squad, Klopp replied: “Yeah. But no call.” \nThe exciting young winger has made just seven appearances in all competitions for Liverpool, and just three starts in total, since he was elevated to the first team squad by Klopp. Coleman's side face Ireland on Friday (Photo: REUTERS) \nIn fact, he is still to make a start in the Premier League, and has played only 37 minutes in total as a substitute in that competition, but Coleman is adamant he deserves his call up into the full Wales squad. \nFor Klopp, the player requires much longer to learn the tricks of the trade before he is ready for senior responsibility, but he insisted Woodburn will not be fazed by his international call up. \nAsked if the 17 year old needed more time to learn before his call up, Klopp replied: “If Ben stopped learning now, that would make no sense at 17. I’m not in doubt about this.
