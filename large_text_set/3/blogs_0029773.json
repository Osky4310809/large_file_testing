It includes much of what a coalition of civil rights activists, religious leaders, and the National Resources Defense Council initially sought and would force Flint and Michigan to commit to long-term plans for rectifying the lead crisis. \nIt also includes, however, a few concessions from the coalition. Instead of having water delivered door-to-door to homes not be verified to have water filters while roughly 18,000 pipelines were replaced, the state will be required to operate nine water distribution centers where Flint residents may pick up bottled water. \nMichigan will be allowed to close up to three of them after May 1, if 20 or fewer people pick up from them, the Detroit News reported . 1,000 days of toxic drinking water in #Flint https://t.co/keoSCQwwCJ pic.twitter.com/810ukSklty — RT America (@RT_America) January 21, 2017 \nThe state will also be required to reserve another $10 million of federal funds in case repairs are more expensive than expected. In addition, the state will be responsible for appointing a third party to monitor the lead levels of 100 homes for at least three years. Michigan will also expand Community Outreach and Resident Education programs in order to provide education, installation, and expansion of water filters. \nThose involved in the litigation cannot comment on the matter until after the deal is formally accepted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:38:58.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
