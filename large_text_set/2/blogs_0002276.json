But DiCaprio has finally lined up his first post-Oscar acting project, and it sounds like it could once again attract the attention of the Academy. \nAccording to Deadline , the actor is set to star in and produce an adaptation of the book \"The Black Hand,\" written by Stephan Talty. The tome tells the true story of Joe Petrosino, a NYPD police officer who worked in the late 1800s and early 1900s to take down dozens of members of a notoriously violent Italian gang -- known as The Black Hand, considered an early precursor to the Italian mob in America -- and was ultimately assassinated by them. \nIn addition to starring as Petrosino, DiCaprio will also produce through his Appian Way banner. Deadline reports that the production is currently looking for a writer to adapt the book into a screenplay, so it appears that filming is still a long way off. \nThis sounds like a juicy role for DiCaprio, and should be a welcome return to the big screen for the actor. Stay tuned to see who else this high-profile project attracts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:26:56.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
