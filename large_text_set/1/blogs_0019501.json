His story went national, and he became known as \"the wine-swilling vandal.\" His friend, Evan Brown, 33, who police say did the actual spray-painting of an obscene phrase on the wall of the Fresh Market store on Germantown Avenue, was charged with a misdemeanor. \nThe national legal website took reader submissions for nominees, which put Lloyd in some high-profile company. The list of lawyers also included Hillary Clinton, FBI Director James Comey, Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and Donald F. McGhan, who served as Trump's campaign counsel. \nVoting ended last week and Lloyd did not win. He finished in sixth place, ahead of Comey and Lynch. \nThe winner was McGhan, Trump's attorney. McGhan's nominators noted that he led Trump to victory without running afoul of election laws or a contested convention. He is now White House counsel. \nClick here for Philly.com's politics page.
