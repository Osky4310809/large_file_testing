Meanwhile, critics such as myself argue that what feminists say and what they do don't line up particularly well.\nFor example, they claim to want equal representation and pay in the workplace, but then focus only on white-collar careers. They ignore that women choosing to avoid careers like shipping or construction causes most of the gender discrepancy -- and they never protest that those fields are male-dominated.\nThe reality is that feminism isn't really about equal opportunity for women -- which few in the West oppose anymore -- but is just another strain of authoritarianism.\nAs an example, take this Australian columnist who wants to outlaw being a stay-at-home mom following a report lamenting the lack of women participating in the Australian workforce:\nRather than wail about the supposed liberation in a woman’s right to choose to shun paid employment, we should make it a legal requirement that all parents of children of school-age or older are gainfully employed.\nThe OECD was right to criticize the double standards applied to Australia’s work-search rules regarding welfare benefits. While young people face strict criteria when seeking to access the dole, those aged over 50 can still receive it despite not looking for a job by citing 15 hours volunteer work a week.\nThe double standards are even greater for stay-at-home mums, with governments of all persuasions traditionally wary to tackle the unfair tax concessions enjoyed by one-income households for fear of inciting voting fury. (No doubt they refer to Abbott’s aforementioned paid parental leave scheme as a cautionary tale).\nBut it’s time for a serious rethink of this kid-glove approach to women of child-bearing and child-rearing age. Holding us less accountable when it comes to our employment responsibilities is not doing anyone any favours. Not children, not fathers, not bosses -- and certainly not women.\nOnly when the female half of the population is expected to hold down a job and earn money to pay the bills in the same way that men are routinely expected to do will we see things change for the better for either gender.\nNow, don't get me wrong. Columnist Sarrah Le Marquand's argument that all parents should work would do wonders to end Australia's welfare system. If everyone who could work did, then only those who are unable to work would be part of that system.\nFew begrudge a welfare system that only takes care of those who are unable to work.\nBut that's not what Le Marquand wants.\nThe premise of her piece is that women aren't working -- and nothing else. An apparently large number of women have opted out of the workforce in order to hold down the fort at home, and that bothers her. People made a decision she disagrees with, so they must be forced to make the right decision.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/parenting/2017/03/23/feminist-writer-says-being-a-stay-at-home-mom-should-be-illegal/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/03/22/columnist-it-should-be-illegal-to-be-a-stay-at-home-mom/"], "published": "2017-03-23T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:43:45.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
