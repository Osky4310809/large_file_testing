Our correspondent from the venue Kaushik Rangarajan has more here on the elegant right-hander's knock. \nCertainly appears like the plan: By scoring at just under 4/over, India's batsmen are giving their bowlers enough time to bowl the opposition out twice. — Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) February 9, 2017 \nBuild up: \nIt was all India on the first day in Hyderabad with the hosts piling on 356 runs at the end of play losing just three wickets in the process. Bangladesh began well, in fact they began with a bang despite losing the toss by getting rid of KL Rahul in the very first over. They also had their moments in the first session where had they been more clinical on the field, they could have fetched at least two more wickets to put India under pressure but they weren't.And from that point, they couldn't exert any pressure on the Indians as the batsmen made merry in the second and in the final session as well. Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay added 178 for the second wicket before the former fell for 83. Vijay though went on to complete this ninth Test century before succumbing to a loose sweep. Kohli, who has been in prolific form in the home season continued his merry ways to make a hundred off just 130 balls. He has Ajinkya Rahane for company, who replaced Karun Nair in the XI. It's all about posting a gigantic first innings score for India. Bangladesh need wickets, early wickets to have a say in the game. Welcome to our live blog for the second day's play from Hyderabad.
