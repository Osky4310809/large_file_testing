After a somewhat slow first two months of the season, Rudolph finished the second half of the season strong, leading all tight ends in targets over the final month. He was as consistent a TE1 as there was on the board in December. Rudolph caught at least six passes in five of his last six games. He finishes the year with new career-highs in catches (83), targets (120), and yards (840), while scoring seven touchdowns. The big thing for Rudolph is he was able to stay healthy and started all 16 games for the second-straight year after playing 17 games total in 2013-2014. Rudolph has three years left on his contract and cemented himself as a top-two option in this offense. He's still just 27 years old and will enter 2017 as a solid, if unspectacular, TE1. Jan 1 - 5:10 PM Kyle Rudolph caught 6-of-9 targets for 53 yards in the Vikings' Week 16 loss to the Packers. It was a typical recent day at the office for Rudolph. He provides volume, but not always yardage. He has only one touchdown in the past six weeks. Sat, Dec 24, 2016 05:47:00 PM Kyle Rudolph caught 8-of-10 targets for 97 yards in the Vikings' Week 15 loss to the Colts. Rudolph was easily the Vikings' most effective means of generating offense on day where they could get nothing going on the ground. Rudolph has been one of the NFL's most consistent tight ends this year. He will be worth firing up confidently again when the Vikings head to Lambeau Field for Week 16. Sun, Dec 18, 2016 04:05:00 PM Kyle Rudolph caught 4-of-8 targets for 60 yards and a touchdown in the Vikings' Week 14 win over the Jaguars. Rudolph keyed the Vikings' first drive with a 44-yard reception and caught the game-sealing touchdown from three yards out in the fourth quarter. An every-week fantasy starter all year, Rudolph has a pristine matchup against the Colts' leaky tight end coverage coming next.
