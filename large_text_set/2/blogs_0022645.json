Youssef Sobhy, a priest at the Mar Girgis Coptic Orthodox Church in El-Arish, provided further insight into the latest attack on Wednesday, and said that three masked men assaulted the father and son at their home. \n\"The men knocked at the door of the home of the Christians and Medhat opened the door,\" Fr. Sobhy told International Christian Concern , a persecution watchdog group. \"The men shot his old father, Saad Hanna, in the head and then they burned the home.\" \nIn another attack on Jan. 30, Coptic Christian trader Wael Youssed Meland was shot and killed by masked men in his grocery shop in El-Arish, while on Feb. 12, a Coptic veterinarian named Bahgat William Zkhar was shot in his car just south of the city. \nTwo other Coptic Christians, Adel Shawky and Gamal Tawfiq Gares, were also shot and killed by masked assailants this month. \n\"Many [have] left and fled while those who find it difficult to leave have sent their children away to relative[s] out[side] of Arish,\" one Christian resident of El-Arish told ICC. \"My family and I want to leave, but we cannot do that because our livelihoods are here, our homes are here, and we have nowhere else to go.\" \nWilliam Stark, ICC's regional manager, called the mounting violence and targeting of believers \"deeply concerning.\" \n\"Christians cannot continue to live under such paralyzing conditions. The authorities must do more to protect vulnerable populations, particularly Christians, as they are being specifically targeted by militants,\" Stark said. \n\"ICC calls on [President Abdel Fattah] el-Sisi's administration to follow through on their promises to defend the Christian population of Egypt.\" Follow Stoyan Zaimov on Facebook: CPSZaimov", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:17:35.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
