He wants to be a photographer. He’s so passionate about what he does … I’m just really proud. My baby’s going to college.” Brooklyn is an incredibly talented photographer. He shares some of his photos on his Instagram page so the world can check out his passion.\nA post shared by bb (@brooklynbeckham) on Feb 17, 2017 at 10:50am PST \nHe takes after his parents a bit and seems to enjoy getting in front of the camera just as much as he enjoys being behind the lens.\nMy passion ❤ \nA post shared by bb (@brooklynbeckham) on Mar 10, 2017 at 1:23am PST \nA post shared by bb (@brooklynbeckham) on Mar 10, 2017 at 1:07pm PST \nNo word on where Brooklyn will be attending college, but no matter where he goes, it sounds like his mom won’t be far behind.\n“It’s probably going to annoy him, but I’m going to spend a lot of time there,” Victoria told Corden.
