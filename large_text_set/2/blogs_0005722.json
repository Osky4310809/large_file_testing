Just in time for New York Fashion Week , the CFDA and PPFA collaborated on pins that read “Fashion Stands with Planned Parenthood.” Designed by Conde Nast’s The Creative Group, the subtle accoutrements are already anticipated to be the hottest item. The hot-pink accessories have been distributed to all participating NYFW designers, public relations agencies, modeling agencies, creative agencies, fashion week locations, industry influencers, and press attending the upcoming event, which begins on Thursday, Feb. 9. “The fashion industry has always been a voice for issues that are important to its base, women being a big part of it — both women who work in our industry and the people who benefit from fashion. So it’s not unusual for us to organize around Planned Parenthood,” Steven Kolb, president and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the CFDA, tells Yahoo Style. Kolb points to the work that the CFDA and their foundation have done for decades around breast cancer and HIV/AIDS as evidence of the fashion industry’s long-standing commitment to taking a stand on health issues that matter to their community and customers. “We’re an industry of creative people and creative people have very big hearts and have always reacted and responded to issues and moments that are important,” Kolb says. “Fashion is powerful in that it touches people every single day. To be able to use Fashion Week or use the industry to extend a message beyond what is the next trend or item to wear, but to put some substance behind that — that’s very powerful.” Tracy Reese, who sits on the board of the CFDA and whose eponymous line has been a fashion mainstay since its launch in 1998, has taken on the role of designer emissary. For this self-appointed job, she’s been reaching out to her fellow designers to encourage them to wear the pin themselves when they go out for their final walk after their runway shows and to also place pins on the models as they go down the runway in their fall lines. More than 40 designers are participating in the initiative. “When we woke up after the election, it was a call to action: What can we do to stand behind the causes we care about?” says Reese of the origins of her involvement in this initiative. “Fashion Week seemed like the perfect time when all eyes are on New York to stand together with Planned Parenthood.” This isn’t the first time that members of the fashion industry have made moves in support of Planned Parenthood and the role it plays in the American healthcare system. On Black Friday this past November, for example, a number of independent designers, including Zero Maria Cornejo, Ulla Johnson, and Apiece Apart, joined forces to commit a portion of their sales to Planned Parenthood under the banner of the hashtag #WomenTogether. There are also the now ubiquitous Nasty Woman by Google Ghost and The Future is Female by Otherwild T-shirts that benefit Planned Parenthood. Additionally, there are and not one but two shirts from the collaboration between designer Marc Jacobs, photographer Marilyn Minter, and Miley Cyrus that benefit Planned Parenthood. Other designers from Rachel Antonoff to independent fragrance house OLO have also donated proceeds of sales at various times to Planned Parenthood. Many major industries other than fashion have taken a public stand in support of the reproductive and sexual healthcare provider, too. Southwest Airlines planes taking passengers to Washington, D.C. for the Women’s March turned the cabin lights pink in support of Planned Parenthood mid-flight. Google’s annual Global Giving Week saw $800,000 raised by employees for Planned Parenthood . Pharmaceutical company Gilead announced a $900,000 grant to Planned Parenthood on Feb. 2 to support and expand efforts in HIV prevention and education services, the first significant corporate grant of its kind awarded to Planned Parenthood. And on Feb. 1, Facebook Chief Operating Office (COO) and Lean In guru Sheryl Sandberg announced her personal gift of $1 million to Planned Parenthood . Read More Reese, whose designs were frequently worn by former First Lady Michelle Obama during her tenure in the White House, believes the CFDA’s new initiative in support of Planned Parenthood is especially critical right now. “This is a nationwide effort and that’s important — a lot of what we do is so focused on New York state and New York City, but we’re talking about the whole country [who is in need of Planned Parenthood],” Reese says. “We need to talk to our customers, talk to people interested in fashion to get information out there and let them know that we will stand with Planned Parenthood. We hope to open their hearts and minds as well.” And Reese and Kolb both say that they hope Washington, D.C. takes note of what’s happening at New York Fashion Week this year — and not just for the fashion. “I hope they see the energy. I hope they see the passion. I hope they see the importance. I hope they see an industry that cares, an industry that I think wants the new administration to succeed, but succeed in a way that is inclusive — and inclusive on issues like this,” says Kolb. Kolb also notes that the FDA is presently “looking at immigration issues,” another issue that “matters to our industry,” at present. To date, the CFDA has not issued any public statement or actions in regards to the Trump administration’s recent executive orders pertaining to immigration, from the commencement of the building of a border wall with Mexico to the halting of the Syrian refugee program and the freeze on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. Says Reese, “I don’t know how much Washington listens, but hopefully they’ll listen to their constituents…I’ve always designed for a diverse group of women. I think all women are beautiful: Every size, every color. I’m about empowerment. I’m about individuality. And I think this is just a natural extension of what I believe in as a designer. I have to push myself and be more vocal about these types of causes that effect me and my customers and the people who look up to me and the people who are disenfranchised or don’t have a voice. If I have a voice, a platform that can do some good, I’m going to use it.” Follow us on Facebook , Instagram , and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:41:35.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
