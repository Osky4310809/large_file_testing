But, PornHub is sneakily one of the most altruistic companies around. The porn empire with close to 80 billion online video views per year has created a sex education blog , donated hundreds of thousands to breast cancer research, awarded scholarships, and launched an anti-domestic violence clothing line with abuse victim and former porn star Christy Mack. With that resume, if PornHub were a person, he could run for President.\nPornHub has continued it’s community service tear by sponsoring plow trucks to plow the streets and parking lots of Boston and New Jersey. Pledging to assist anyone who “wants to get plowed,” PornHub says it is sending out a fleet of branded trucks to clear the roads and parking lots for free.\n“The Pornhub team understands that by this time of year, most cities have run up their budget in snow removal,” Pornhub Vice President Corey Price tells Boston , “and we thought we’d lend a hand in getting our fans plowed.”\nThe trucks will also be available on demand to clear lots owned by small businesses, Price says.\n \n \nHey Boston! Are you snowed in on #snowday ? Fear not! #pornhubplows to the rescue! Hit us up at phubplows@gmail.com to plow your brains out! pic.twitter.com/bYmHD6QVwP \n— Pornhub ARIA (@Pornhub) March 14, 2017 \n\nYou know what, just because of this good deed, I may give PornHub some traffic tonight. Just as a thank you. But mostly because I’m addicted to porn.\n[h/t Boston ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:54:47.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
