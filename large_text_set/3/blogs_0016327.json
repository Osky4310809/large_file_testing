Khloe Hill, a London-based blogger, made her own meme for social media and called it “Dear Acne, let’s break up.” She shared a photo of her spot-covered, makeup-free face, and uses the caption section to sound off against embarrassment or stigma surrounding acne. Anyone who has ever canceled plans because of a zit needs to read this post. “I HAVE ACNE…… it’s normal to get spots…. and having them doesn’t make me a bad person or an ugly person,” Hill writes. “I used to be really embarrased [sic] about it and never ever ever leave the house without makeup.” She asks for acceptance of anything society’s deemed an “unflawless” face. “Just like freckles, cellulite, scars and marks… these spots don’t reflect the person on the inside,” she says. The post has gotten more than 3,800 likes so far, with fans weighing in in the comments about how much acne has held them back. Others are playing armchair dermatologist and giving Hill unsolicited advice about how to “fix” her skin (those people should probably read the part where she writes “spots are the least of my worries”). Hill created the post to inspire her fellow acne-sufferers, she tells Yahoo Beauty. “How I look is normally the before picture in some advert trying to sell you some miracle cream to make you look perfect,” she says. “If there were more pictures of unedited, unfiltered bare faces it might make people feel like it’s a normal thing.” As for the haters, she says, “All the ugly comments are worth it though as if my post can help one person feel better then it’s worth doing!” Read more from Yahoo Style + Beauty:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:03:13.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
