And there was a clash between the protesters, army and police which led to holocaust,” Archbishop Udeh said. \nHe warned Ndigbo living in the North adding that the only thing that could avert the impending crisis was release of Kanu as many had so demanded. \nUdeh noted that from his own point of view, Kanu had done nothing to deserve the long period of incarceration he had continued to suffer, stressing that lawmakers of Igbo extraction in the National Assembly should go on protest to persuade the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to listen to what he called voice of wisdom to release Kanu before the nation is plunged into an avoidable crisis. \nHe regretted that the lawmakers had pretended over the years not to know that they should make meaningful contributions to see that the IPOB leader is released. \nThe Archbishop who described the Ohanaeze Ndigbo as a toothless bulldog in the past also tasked the apex Igbo socio cultural organization to rise up to its responsibilities to fight injustices meted to the Igbo in various angles. \nOn President Buhari’s administration, the Archbishop declared that it had failed because of rising economic difficulties in Nigeria which end, he said, was not in sight and called on the National Assembly to impeach the President. He cited cases of suicides and attempted suicides as part of evidences of a failed government. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T19:02:32.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
