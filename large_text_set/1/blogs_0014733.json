They almost never work out . \nBack in December, comedian Jordan Garnett got a \"Super Bowl LI Champions\" tattoo , featuring a Dallas Cowboys logo. The Cowboys, of course, lost their Divisional round game to the Green Bay Packers and opened Garnett up for ridicule on the internet. \nHe has since made an update to that tattoo, but Cowboys fans won't be any happier about it. “Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.” I know 100%. I had a vision! @dallascowboys SUPER BOWL 52 CHAMPS! pic.twitter.com/t2jpAzf7RR — Jordan Garnett (@jordangarnett) January 18, 2017 \nGarnett added an extra \"I\" to the \"LI,\" which means that he hasn't learned his lesson at all. The Cowboys should be one of the top teams in the NFL next season, but they shouldn't expect to win the Super Bowl because preemptive championship tattoos are the worst. \nAssuming Garnett will include an additional \"I\" once the Cowboys are eliminated again next season, the earliest Dallas can win a title will be Super Bowl LIV. It's the rule. @nfl Hey Dallas Cowboys! Now it's official. Don't let me down. SUPER BOWL 51 CHAMPIONS!!! Tattooed on 12/6/16. I'm calling it now. pic.twitter.com/BRDkhicgOS — Jordan Garnett (@jordangarnett) December 6, 2016 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k1ddqX Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:44:11.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
