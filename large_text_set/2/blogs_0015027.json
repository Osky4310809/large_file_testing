They were conversations that needed to be had, and a great dinner and everything like that.”\nLast month, Stanton told PEOPLE : “There was a lot of different reasons . At the end of the day, we were just two very different people. I think there are some things when you love someone you can work on and try to fix things, and then there are some things you just can’t fix. I think it got to that point where we just knew it wasn’t going to work.”\nAt the time, she said the pair were “going to go our separate ways,” but now it looks like their paths might be converging again.\nOn Monday, Murray told ET : “There’s a possibility for anything … There’s a lot of things that we still need to talk about, just for moving on as friends or anything in the future, and we’re beginning to do that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:54:48.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
