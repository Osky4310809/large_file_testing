She was suspended by cables with hundreds of colored drones flying overhead in the sky to form an American Flag. Soon, Gaga ended with the Pledge of Allegiance before leaping off the roof and floating down to a stage in the middle of the field. Upon hitting the stage, Gaga sang “Poker Face,” before again jumping and landing to a lower platform. \nOnce hitting the below platform, Gaga was joined by dancers donning black and purple outfits, with cape vests for a killer performance of “Born This Way.” Next up was an energetic performance of “Telephone,” followed by “Just Dance.” For “Just Dance,” Gaga put on a fold, spiked jacket and played a hand-held keyboard while moving around the stage. \nAfterwards, the stage went dark and Gaga popped back up, sans her glitter applique makeup, sitting at a piano. Gaga proceeded to serenade the crowd with a powerful performance of “Million Reasons.” In a small break in the song, an almost out-of-breath Gaga took a moment to give a shout out to her Mom and Dad, which was very cute. At the end of the song, Gaga went up to a few fans and lent them a hug before dashing off to perform “Bad Romance.” \"Hey mom..Hey dad.\" \nFrom small bars to the biggest stage in the world. CRYING. SO PROUD OF YOU, @ladygaga !! #PepsiHalftime #Superbowl pic.twitter.com/NCvJsXpQP8 \n— Potato (@potatoesef) February 6, 2017 \nThe dancers were decked out in white outfits and Gaga stripped down even more, wearing white and glitter football-playing shoulder pads. As the performance carried on, Gaga was raised up on a platform to dance on a higher level before she was carried off by her dancers. \nAt the end of the performance, Gaga spiked her microphone, caught a glittered ball and jumped from the stage, yelling “Super Bowl 51.” Lady Gaga backstage just minutes before her #PepsiHalftime Show. #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/c6yGeuGGlG \n— Kuns ✨ (@HomoNoBro) February 6, 2017 \nFor weeks, fans have been speculating and wondering about the details of the halftime show performance for the 2017 Super Bowl. Lady Gaga has been very quiet about what she’s had planned, though she has let a few things out of the bag. She revealed on a radio show that her sister had an idea to suspend her in air and it was also reported that Tony Bennett would introduce her halftime performance. Unfortunately, Bennett did not introduce Gaga. \nWhen talking about her halftime performance earlier this week to CBS Sports , Gaga stated that: \nI’m going to be taking the spirit of many performers with me on that stage when I go up there. I’m grateful to have wonderful women in this business that are supportive of me. \nPreviously, there were rumors that Beyonce might drop in to perform with Gaga at the halftime show when Gaga posted an emoji of a bee on her Instagram. Beyonce and Gaga have collaborated in the past for the song “Telephone.” Check out the music video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:46:38.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
