Melee to Injustice to Marvel vs. Capcom to Playstation All Stars . But what are some other universes who could use fighting games of their own? We explore a few! Read on below! Image Comics \n(source) \nImage has such a ridiculously diverse cast of characters, from edgy superheroes like Spawn to the cosmic adventurers of Ody-C to the zombies of The Walking Dead to the sex comedy heroes of Sex Criminals . I want to see them all battle each other! Kingdom Hearts \n(source) \nI want to see all the Disney characters fight, you see, but that ain’t the Disney way! But Kingdom Hearts figured out a way to make Hercules battle Stitch, and a fighting game is just that at its purest, baby! Adult Swim \nAt this point, Adult Swim has such a deep roster of diverse character that anyone who denies the glory of seeing Rick Sanchez fight Meatwad is but a fool! Nicktoons vs. Cartoon Network \nIt’s like Marvel vs. Capcom but would answer the questions I've been asking myself for years — could CatDog beat up Dexter in his robot suit?! Could SpongeBob beat up Jake the Dog?! It would up to you to decide. Saturday Night Live \n(source) \nOh boy oh boy. I want to play as the John Belushi Samurai and defeat the dudes who put their dicks in a box! Or play as Jimmy Fallon and lose on purpose! Or be Norm MacDonald and fight off Kate MacKinnon’s Olga with classy OJ Simpson jokes. It would be grand. \nWhat do you think, any fictional universes you'd want to fight in?
