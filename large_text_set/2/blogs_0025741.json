Otherwise, they have an extremely interesting arrangement that we would love to investigate further.\nAfter the guy tries to salvage any of the dignity he has left, the girl quickly shuts him down after realizing his end game.

Did you not just learn from these awkward texts? C'mon, do better.\nSo remember:\nBe careful of who you're texting, or you'll be exposed on Twitter.\nYou'll need more than chocolate to win someone's heart.\nAnd maybe never use the phrase \"BALLS DEEP BRO\" if you ever want to get laid again.\nBONUS: Oscars contender 'La La Land' gets an old school video game treatment", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:12:38.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
