He’ll undergo an MRI on Wednesday and will not return to the game. It is unclear at this time how much time, if any, he will miss.\nDurant was asked to be taken out of the game after Zaza Pachulia accidentally backed into his leg while fighting for a rebound with Marcin Gortat. You can see the play here which happened in the first minute of the game. Durant tried to play through the next couple of minutes but eventually headed back to the locker room.\nKD doesn't look good after this weird injury. Limped next few possessions.
