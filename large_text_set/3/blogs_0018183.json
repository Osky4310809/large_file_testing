For further ticketing details, we're waiting on the cinemas - Disney Malaysia will apparently be releasing a statement later tonight so stay tuned. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST CONFIRMED FOR 30 MARCH WITHOUT CUTS. RT this and get excited! #BeOurGuest Homosexuality the issue <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JG6f5_37tg?wmode=opaque\">Embedded video</a> \nAfter yesterday's hubbub over the film premiere cancellation, the Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) has passed the film after an edit. \nLPF Chairman Abdul Halim Abdul Hamid told The Star that a \"gay moment\" was cut from the film and that it would be rated PG-13. \nAs to the actual screening date, the film was supposed to begin screening 16 March and those with pre-bought tickets from Golden Screen Cinemas (GSC) and TGV have been told to claim refunds. \nTourism and Culture Minister Nazri Aziz had weighed in on the film's earlier abrupt postponement, calling a blanket ban on films just for having homosexual characters \"ridiculous\". \nThe gay character in the film, Le Fou, is played by Josh Gad and was said to have an \"exclusively gay\" moment in the film, which has prompted the film to be banned from an Alabama film theatre. In Russia, there have been protests against the film's gay content, with a compromise reached - the film will be screened, but children under 16 will not be allowed in. \nIf you'd rather skip the cinema and chill with Netflix, here's our recommendations for your TV binge-fest. \nUPDATE 16/3/2017: The Star has just reported that Disney Malaysia has lodged an appeal against the cuts but the censorship board is not budging. Disney US is also adamant about not letting any scene be cut in the film. \nDisney is holding the film's release until 30 March but pending a miracle, don't hold your breath for the film's official release in the cinema. Still, it might well still be released to disc or on official purchase via iTunes or Google Movies so now might be a good time to start planning that home movie Beauty and the Beast party. \nUPDATE 15/3/2017: Bloomberg reported that Disney in an email statement said: \"The film has not been and will not be cut for Malaysia.\" \nAs Malaysia's Film Censorship Board will only allow the screening with cuts, removing a gay subplot, it looks like an impasse has been reached and \"postponed indefinitely\" might as well be interpreted as \"possibly never\". \nIf you've pre-bought tickets to the film, we suggest you claim your refund soonest as there is no way Malaysia will make the 16 March premiere date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:27:50.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
