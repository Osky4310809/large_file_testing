After all, if they lose 2-0 away, then they are out. \nBut that is not the way Man City manager Pep Guardiola will think. News Group Newspapers Ltd Lothar Matthaus is SunSport’s European and international football expert \nGuardiola would never play tactically the way Paris Saint-Germain boss Unai Emery did in Barcelona. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Champions League news, gossip and transfers on our club page \nPlaying just for the result that will be enough to get through is never his way. For Guardiola, the system and tactics can change but not the approach, attitude or philosophy. \nAnd with him in charge, there is no way City will go into their shells in Monte Carlo like PSG did at Barcelona. Getty Images 7 Pep Guardiola won’t let his side capitulate like Unai Emery’s PSG did \nOne thing I’m sure of is that Pep would have been very angry with his team in the first leg because of the goals they gave away. \nThey also didn’t have as much ball possession as he would have wanted and they got away with it because of the quality they have as an attacking side. \nDriving them Sane \nIN his first six months at City, Leroy Sane had some problems in adapting but that was always likely to happen. \nIt was a big change in his life, to come at a young age from Schalke to a really big club, with a big coach and so many more international players of the highest level around him. \nSane has a great talent but he needed help to push him and teach him. Getty Images 7 Leroy Sane is Pep Guardiola’s perfect player… he will play a big part in Man City’s Champions League run \nWhat has been important is that he has been very smart. He listened to the coach and is feeling the fans’ love as they are now seeing what he can do. \nHe is unselfish and can be the key. Sane has always had the pace and technique, the ability to hold the ball and dribble. \nThen it’s about the pass — but he has a nose to smell the right thing to do. \nFor me, he is the perfect Guardiola player. Reuters 7 Leroy Sane wheels away after scoring the fifth goal for Manchester City against Monaco \nWhen he came to City he only really thought about the attacking side. Now I see he is working harder defensively as well. \nHe’s not one of those players who feels he has to score. He is happy to set up Sergio Aguero and give him the key ball. Serg of desire \nIN the last few weeks we have seen the real Sergio Aguero again and I’m sure that is because he was ­motivated by what happened at the start of the year with Gabriel Jesus. \nAguero had always been an automatic starter but, out of nowhere, this young Brazilian came in and stole his position and scored goals. Getty Images 7 Sergio Aguero has hit form at the right time after Gabriel Jesus kept him on the bench \nCompetition is good for any player as long as they react the right way and use it as motivation. Aguero understood that and gave the right reaction. \nIn the last few games, he has shown exactly that and again proved he is a natural goalscorer in the big games. \nBut it was good for Pep, too, to see how Aguero responded to the challenge. The verdict \nI SAID Monaco could surprise people and we saw that in the first leg. \nFor an hour they were excellent but now City are in a good position to go through. \nWhat last week proved, once again, is that there are no certainties in the Champions League. Getty Images 7 Manchester City will have a tough night in Monaco but their two-goal advantage should see them through \nI learned that the hardest way possible with Bayern Munich in Barcelona in 1999, when we were better than Manchester United but lost to the last kick. \nAs an attacking side, I see City as being as good as Barcelona. \nThe problem, still, is their defence and that is something Guardiola must sort this summer. \nMonaco have a good team, even without the star names, and they are better than PSG. \nCity will look to win but might find that difficult. I expect goals, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T06:06:06.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
