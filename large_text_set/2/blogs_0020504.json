With that said, it’s actually now possible to install some of those apps directly onto an iOS device without needing to be jailbroken or use the App Store, as most of you will already know. \nOne such app which takes advantage of this is a store experience called TuTu Helper or TutuApp , which basically provides access to a range of content and ‘hacked’ app experiences. We’re going to walk you through the relatively simply process of installing it. \nStep 1: First of all, on your iOS device, you’re going to need to open up the Safari browser and navigate to the app’s website at the following URL: tutapp.vip. \nStep 2: Once there, you will be presented with a fairly large button with the label Download Now . Make sure you select Regular and not VIP before hitting the Download Now button. \nStep 3: Tap the Download Now button and then hit Install on the resulting popup as shown in the screenshot below. \nStep 4: The service will then instantly try and install the app on your iOS device, leaving an icon in place on the Home screen just like any normal app install would. However, trying to launch it right now would prompt an Untrusted Enterprise Developer error. To fix this, launch Settings and select General . \nStep 5: Navigate to Device Management > [name of the developer] and then tap on Trust and then Trust again on the certificate. On some iOS versions, this would be General > Profile(s) & Device Management or General > Profile(s) . \nAnd there you have it. The TuTu Helper/TuTuApp experience should now launch on the device when tapped, and will instantly give users access to all of the features and functionality that is has been designed and published to offer. \nYou might also like to check out:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:32:51.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
