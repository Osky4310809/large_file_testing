Muscat lamented his side’s lack of intensity and structure in a sluggish first term, when uncharacteristic turnovers afforded the enterprising Jets possession and territory. \n“All their attacking movement came from us giving the ball away, especially square,” Muscat said.

Muscat was reluctant to reflect on his team’s rapidly dwindling Premiers’ Plate hopes. \n“That ain’t going to help me,” he said. \n“What I can change from now until Central Coast (on Sunday) is our performance... so I’ll spend all my energy there.” \n- Additional reporting with AAP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:27:56.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
