Indian spy Kulbhushan Yadev is one such evidence of these efforts and his case will be taken to the logical conclusion.” \nCOAS said that Pakistan Army will do its duty to protect people of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir against all forms of Indian aggression. \n“We will continue our solidarity with people of Indian Occupied Kashmir who are struggling for their right of self-determination”, he said \nEarlier on arrival at LOC, COAS was received by Commander Rawalpindi Corps Lt Gen Nadeem Raza. 0 0 COAS says fully aware of Indian support to terrorism in Pakistan was   Pakistan, Pakistan News, Latest News Pakistan, Geo News, Geo Tv, .   \"COAS says fully aware of Indian support to terrorism in Pakistan\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/131907-COAS-says-fully-aware-of-Indian-support-to-terrorism- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:12:57.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
