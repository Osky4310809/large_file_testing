This season has seen West, as portrayed by Keiynan Lonsdale , receive a lot of screen time as his character has been developed to inch closer and closer to becoming a costumed hero. Finally, during the midseason finale, we officially saw Wally take up the Kid Flash moniker. \nIn a recent interview with TVLine, The Flash co-showrunner Aaron Helbing took an opportunity to speak about the future of Barry and Wally working side by side as The Flash and Kid Flash. \n“He’s got the skills, but he’s got the hubris, too, that comes along with it. I mean, he was a drag racer in Season 2,” Helbing told TVLine. “He has that need for speed, so he goes a little half-cocked sometimes, and that gets him into danger. That will play out throughout the season, that he’ll have to realize that he’s got to check himself. \nIt’s no secret that Wally has been very impatient at times, especially when it comes to his powers and access to the Speed Force maturing. \n“There’s a reason why Barry has the attitude and the mentality that he has when he goes out there,” reflect Helbing. “He’s very methodical. He learned it from Oliver [Queen], and now he is trying to impart that wisdom to Kid Flash.” \nThe Flash airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:13:44.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
