She told ABC’s ’20/20′ in a new interview that Tom ‘damaged’ the Church’s image! \nLeah Remini , 45, sat down with ABC’s 20/20 to dish on her reasons for leaving the Church of Scientology after over 30 years. In advance of her upcoming book Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology, the former The King of Queens star put Tom Cruise , 53, on blast for his crazy antics while courting Katie Holmes , 36, as well as getting her in trouble with church officials following his 2006 wedding to Katie. To hear more about Leah Remini, head over to iTunes and download the latest HollywoodLife podcast for free! \nShe really lit in to Scientology’s biggest star . “Being critical of Tom Cruise is being critical of Scientology itself. You are a person anti the aims and goals of the church. You are evil,” she revealed. Leah also disapproved of Tom’s behavior while courting now ex-wife Katie. She said,”I don’t think it’s becoming of a Scientologist to be jumping on people’s couches” referring to Tom’s bizarre 2005 Oprah Winfrey Show appearance noting “what the hell is this guy doing? He just needs to be an actor!” \nLeah claims Tom was “damaging the church” with later attacks on Matt Lauer and Brooke Shields , saying she told church officials “We need to reign it in and stop all this,” about his escalating public behavior. \nDespite earlier reports that Katie would be part of the special, the former Mrs. Tom Cruise did not appear. She released a statement to the program saying “I regret having upset Leah in the past and wish her only the best in the future.” Leah mentioned she was “written up” by church officials for her behavior during Tom and Katie’s Nov. 2006 Italian wedding, with claims she was “loud, late and rude.” Leah claims in her 20/20 interview that she was forced to “apologize for ruining the wedding of the century,” and that even Katie filed a complaint against her. Katie has since left the church. \nAs for questions about “How does someone like you get into some crazy crap like this?” it’s because she joined the Church on her mother’s behest when she was only seven-years-old. It was over 30 years before she left, and Leah noted the challenges she had to overcome when she left Scientology. \n“The decision to leave (the church) is you’re giving up everything you’ve worked for your whole life,” Leah admitted. “I feel that people need to understand this has been my whole life.” She added, “As time goes on, you start to lose touch with the real world. The mindset becomes us against them.” \nHollywoodLifers , did you watch Leah’s interview on 20/20 ? \n— Beth Shilliday,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:27:49.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
