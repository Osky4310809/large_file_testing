Its leaders have threatened another independence vote to ensure Scotland remains. \nFallon's comments drew angry rebukes from senior Scottish politicians, including Sturgeon. \nREAD MORE: Can Nicola Sturgeon turn Brexit into an opportunity? \n\"The arrogance of the Tories knows no bounds,\" a spokesperson for Sturgeon said on Thursday, using another name for the ruling Conservative party. \n\"Not content with trying to drag us out of EU against our will, with the support of just one MP out of 59 in Scotland, they are now suggesting they might try to block the nation's right to choose a different path. \n\"Any Tory bid to block a referendum would be a democratic outrage, but would only succeed in boosting support for both a referendum and for independence itself.\" \nWhile the SNP has strongly opposed Brexit, polls on whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom have not shifted after the result of the EU referendum last year; a majority still stand against Scottish independence. \nThe University of Edinburgh's Alan Convery, a specialist in UK and Scottish politics, said time was running out for Sturgeon and the SNP to drum up support for independence. \n\"This is precisely the type of Brexit that Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted to avoid,\" he told Al Jazeera, referring to British Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for a clean break with the EU, including leaving the single market. \n\"The First Minister therefore has a very difficult decision to make about whether to pull the trigger for a second referendum. \n\"The opinion polls have not shifted markedly in her favour, but the Brexit timetable is marching on.\" \nA spokeswoman for May, meanwhile, said on Thursday that the 2014 Scottish referendum was \"legal, fair and decisive\". \nMay has repeatedly said she sees no need for a second vote.
