The video he shot, which was shared by CityNews, shows a group of officers holding a suspect down on a sidewalk.\n\"He's down and they Tased him!\" Khan says.\nMoments later, one of the officers asks Khan to move back if he's going to be a witness.\n\"I'm not obstructing your arrest,\" Khan replies and continues filming.\n“Get that guy out of my face, please,\" the officer says moments later as he points at Khan.\nLater, two officers come up to him and threaten to seize his phone if he chooses to be a witness.\nPolice in Canada do not have the authority to do this. As long as someone is not obstructing police from doing their job, witnesses have the right to photograph an officer doing their job in public.\n'Wrong approach'\nEven Toronto Police spokesperson Mark Pugash admitted the video was a \"teaching moment.\"\n“They have no authority [to seize the phone],\" Pugash told the Star. \"That approach is the wrong approach.”.\nPugash told CTV that Toronto officers have been informed people can film them so long as they are not obstructing or interfering with police work.\n\"And as far as I could see from this video, the person filming wasn't doing anything wrong,\" he said.\nThis officer in Khan's video tells him the suspect will \"spit in your face, you're going to get AIDS. (Photo: CityNews Toronto/YouTube)\nKhan's video takes an even more bizarre twist toward the end. As the two officers walk toward him, one of them says the suspect is going to \"spit in your face, you're going to get AIDS.\"\nKhan told CBC News the incident was disturbing to witness.\n\"You don't get HIV from someone spitting on you ... I think this speaks to the way this officer or these officers look toward certain demographics of people,\" he told the broadcaster.\nExperiences like Khan's happen much more frequently in the U.S.\nDespite it being legal to film and photograph police officers there, there have been many cases of cops seizing phones or ordering people to turn off cameras.\n“There are First Amendment protections for people photographing and recording in public,” Mickey Osterreicher, an attorney with the National Press Photographers Association, told The Huffington Post in 2014.\nAlso on HuffPost:\nClose  The Most Outrageous Stories Of Police Misconduct of   In a lawsuit filed July 26 Shoshoni police chief Andy Rodriguez was accused of using a Taser on a man whose lawyer refers to him as a \"cat guy.\" A police report explains what happened when Rodriguez tried to arrest the \"cat guy,\" L.J. Faith, for animal cruelty. \"I deployed the Taser to Faith's left side arm. During the attempt to control Faith's arm, I realized the Taser was not having a meaningful affect [sic]...\" Not deterred, the officer loaded another probe, but something went awry: \"As I was attaching [another] probe cartridge to the Taser, I had the sensation of falling backwards... I recall the Taser discharging... a probe had penetrated my right index finger... I pulled the probe out of my finger and was going to reload with a second probe cartridge when officer Cruche told me he had been hit as well. I looked over and [he] was bleeding from the top of his head near the hair line.\"\nTexas Deputy Constable Jimmy Drummond. was charged in the brutal 2011 beating of a young man and his family. Police dashboard camera footage, released in September, allegedly shows Drummond beating a man who was pulled over for speeding.

KOB explains what allegedly happened: According to court records, police arrested Tapia for a probation violation tied to a previous drug case. While at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Tapia said two officers strip searched her and asked her to bend over at the waist. That’s when they noticed a plastic baggie protruding from Tapia’s vagina. Instead of taking Tapia to a doctor to have the baggie removed, she said one of the officers – Blanca Zapater – sprayed a chemical agent directly on her genitals twice.\nIn January, New Mexico man David Eckert was subjected to a series of invasive and degrading drug search procedures after a traffic stop. The procedures, which included x-rays, digital anal penetration, enemas and a colonoscopy, were all performed without Eckert's consent. Authorities conducted the searches because Eckert allegedly clinched his buttocks.\nMichael Saffioti's family filed a lawsuit in November after the 22-year-old Washington resident died in his cell following an arrest for pot possession. According to the lawsuit, Saffioti may have suffered an allergic reaction in his jail cell caused by the food he was given while behind bars.

The department said that mistakes will happen in a city where officers make 30,000 arrests every year. But Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri, told The Huffington Post that these accidents are unacceptable. \"To say we are a large city and mistakes will happen as if that justifies a depravation of liberty is simply incorrect,\" Mittman said.\nAn audit filed in October, 2013 found that law enforcement offices in Fulton County, Georgia are using asset forfeiture money on galas, back-rent, fancy restaurants and a field trip to see Headline News anchor Nancy Grace, among other questionable expenditures. Fulton County D.A.

He didn't care. He arrested us anyways.\" The police department denied any wrongdoing but prosecutors elected not to bring charges.\n Share  Tweet  &#10006 Advertisement Share this &#10006 close Current Slide More: filming police photographing police filming police laws filming police laws canada can you film police in canada can you photograph police in canada filming cops canada photographing cops canada police photography police photography laws canada video ", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/filming-police-officers_n_5676940.html", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817780_sq50.jpg", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817774_sq50.jpg", "http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/toronto-mayor-displeased-by-police-threat-to-seize-phone-from-arrest-witness-1.3256157", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817786_sq50.jpg", "https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/24/toronto-police-threaten-to-seize-phone-of-man-lawfully-filming-arrest.html", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817778_sq50.jpg", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817790_sq50.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zHArtENsvc8", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817782_sq50.jpg", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817776_sq50.jpg", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817784_sq50.jpg", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/khan-speaks-out-tasering-1.3951181", "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5049658/thumbs/o-TORONTO-POLICE-570.jpg?16", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817788_sq50.jpg", "http://api.huffingtonpost.com:80/v1/", "http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/493526/slide_493526_6817792_sq50.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-26T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:53:33.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
