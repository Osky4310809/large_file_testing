The full picture \nEach Monday, they sit together and plan the care that will be offered to the mostly elderly people they are working with in a number of care homes in the Wakefield district. \nBecause each here brings a different specialism to the table, they can, as a group, build up a complete picture of how best to help each patient. \nThere is one woman they are especially worried about this week. She has fallen quite a few times, but as they talk it begins to look less like a purely physical problem. \n\"I carried out a physio session last week,\" says Karen. \nShe was \"very anxious. It was difficult to engage with her,\" adds Kay. \n\"So today if things don't seem to be improving we may look at discussing with the psychiatrist whether she needs a review,\" concludes Sue. \n\"As professionals we are linking up,\" Sue continues. \"We're discussing the case between ourselves. We have links to the GP. We have links to the mental health services and we are all working together rather than in isolation.\" \n\"We've seen some good results.\" Image caption Mental health nurse Sue Robson says they have seen good results in Wakefield \nAcross the board this project in Wakefield - which at its most basic aims to get the different parts of the health service and the care system working together - is easing the pressures on the NHS and on care homes. \nThey have seen a sizable reduction in the number of patients who've had to go to hospital from the care homes they work in. A reduction in the use of ambulances. A reduction in the number of days patients who do go to hospital end up spending in a hospital bed. \nIt's both about keeping patients out of hospital in the first place, and getting them home as quickly as possible if they do need to go. \nIn the first nine months of 2016-17, phase one of the Wakefield Vanguard Care Homes scheme recorded: 19% reduction in emergency admissions 12% reduction A&E attendances 9% reduction in ambulance call-outs 26% reduction in bed days \nSource: Wakefield Clinical Commissioning Group \nThe project has involved NHS workers training up care home staff beyond the basic first aid most already have. That gives care homes the skills they need to better diagnose what is wrong with a resident who falls ill. It is resulting in better care for patients and fewer 999 calls for an ambulance. Tackling loneliness \nThere are also efforts to improve people's health in the first place. A lot of work is going into making the men and women who live in care homes and \"independent living\" flats (they used to be known as sheltered accommodation) feel less isolated. \nSharon Carter runs one project that aims to stop the elderly feeling lonely. It's called Portrait of a Life. Essentially it's a photo and memory book that residents like 91-year-old Marjorie Smith receive. Image caption Marjorie Smith is a resident at the Croftlands independent living scheme \nIt helps them reminisce, it helps other older people living in the same accommodation get to know their neighbours, and it helps care staff learn about what makes the people in their care tick. \n\"We're finding they have a better sense of well-being as opposed to ill-being,\" says Sharon. \nAlong with everything else the project is doing, she says it's led to fewer people going into hospital and residential care. \nMany of course still do end up in hospital. And when they do Louise Lumley works at the \"getting them home\" end of the process. \nShe's part of Age UK's Wakefield District team, and outside Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield she's securing 82-year-old June Lord's wheelchair in the back of an adapted car. It will be a 20-minute journey home. \nWhen they arrive, Louise goes through a list of questions. Does June have someone who can help her in the coming days? Does she have the medicine she needs? Is there anything at home that's particularly dangerous that might need to be made safe, to prevent future injuries? \nThe answers will go into a database that can help tailor June's care in the coming months.
