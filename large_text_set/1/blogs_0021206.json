Chang made the claims in an interview with tech site Tbreak earlier today, stating:\n“I can tell you that we’re not going to have an Android watch. I don’t thing [sic] we’ve nailed it with [the experience of] watches. Android watch is one thing but even Apple as a big brand is declining [in watches.] We are not going to have a watch in the short term.”\nThe claim would seemingly put an end to rumors of an upcoming HTC wearable, which was believed to be going under the codename HTC Halfbeak .\nThough there’s no telling how long “the short term” will last for HTC, we can presume it’s until a major manufacturer starts to sell them in significant volumes.\nSee also: Best smartwatches (January 2017) 2 weeks ago The general demand for several hundred dollar, wrist-mounted, notification displays seems to be waning and some manufacturers are hesitant about releasing new hardware.\nGoogle, however, appears unconcerned, as it plans to release two smartwatches this year (developed in partnership with another company, unlike the Pixel smartphones ) which would help promote the upcoming Android Wear 2.0 platform .\nWill Google show everyone else how to do smartwatches right?
