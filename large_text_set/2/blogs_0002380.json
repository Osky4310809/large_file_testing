Why mess with a good thing? \nA pregnant Natalie Portman picked another classic silhouette; but something about her look reminded us of a hospital gown. \nFelicity Huffman looked sleek and chic. The lines on this gown only enhanced her fit frame. \nEmily Blunt’s intricately beaded Roberto Cavalli gown was beautiful — we just wish the color didn’t wash out the best actress nominee. \nDev Patel opted for a sleek navy Brunello Cucinelli suit instead of a boring black tux. \nEmma Stone doesn’t strike us as a big ballgown-wearer, and this Alexander McQueen was fine. It just lacked drama and excitement — which we want to see from a leading lady. This is just a bit … basic. \nThere was something whimsical about Claire Foy’s Valentino dress we loved, especially the contrast between the pink bodice and floral black overlay (take note, Emma Stone). \nLike Emma Stone, the top of Taylor Schilling’s dress seemed better suited for the boudoir than the red carpet. The top was unsubstantial, while the skirt was so heavy. The burgundy color is beautiful, though. \n“Captain Fantastic” star Annalise Basso made a statement at her first SAG Awards with dramatic Bibhu Mohapatra dress. Twirl, girl! \n“Orange is the New Black” star Danielle Brooks wore custom Christian Sirano. We loved that she wore pants, but wish they were better fitting. The train seemed like an afterthought as well. \nBest supporting actor winner Mahershala Ali looked dapper in a classic crisp white tuxedo. \nDanielle’s “OINTB” costar Diane Guerrero made our worst dressed list due to the unnecessary and voluminous tulle emerging from her hip. \n“Game of Thrones” star Sophie Turner’s dress wasn’t a game-changer, but you can’t go wrong with a sexy red dress when you’ve got her height and stunning face. \nOn a night when her “Modern Family,” costar Sofia Vergara played it safe, Julie Bowen went the super revealing look in this see-thru dress that screamed “look at me!” \nWarrior woman indeed! Another “GoT” star — Gwendoline Christie — rocked this custom Vivienne Westwood jumpsuit. \nThere’s nothing wrong with Octavia Spencer’s dress per se — we just wish the “Hidden Figures” star had worn something more celebratory and festive (the movie won best ensemble). \nSome may argue that Janelle Monae’s look was a bit busy, but she’s been able to successfully mix prints and textures at every awards show this season (while sticking to her signature black and white palette). We’re always curious what she’ll wear next, and that’s a good thing. \nWe were torn over Taraji P. Henson’s dress. We loved the color, but the sheer front was just a bit too revealing (no hidden figure here), and the little black bows were unnecessary. She had the confidence of a winner, and she was one. \nJames Marsden’s best accessory: his dazzling smile. \nThandie Newton’s dress seemed more suited for her sci-fi western series “Westworld” than the SAG Awards, with an odd structured shoulder piece and moon and horse details. \n“Westworld’s” Evan Rachel Wood has worn an Altuzarra suit to every red carpet this season, and looked super smart in this navy velvet double-breasted number. \nWe adored the lightness of Kaley Cuoco’s Marchesa dress, but the oddly restraining neckline, sheer bodice, and petal details were too much. \nMany are going to disagree with us, but we think Mayim Bialik nailed it. Her dress was colorful, striped (one of the trends of the night), and she looked comfortable in it. \nWhereas Kaley Cuoco went light, Kate Hudson took a trip to the dark side. The severe lip and hair were unflattering, and we have no idea why she added the floral detail to her dress. \n“Stranger Things” breakout Millie Bobby Brown beamed in her red Armani gown. It was both age-appropriate and sophisticated at the same time. \nRami Malek did the Dior brand proud (he’s a new spokesmodel) in this charcoal houndstooth suit with red stitching. \nThis is actually not a bad look for Busy Philipps, but the purple camo print didn’t win us over. \nMichelle Dockery also took on the stripe trend in this colorful Elie Saab dress. Can you tell we like color? \nAnother Michelle (and Busy’s BFF) — Michelle Williams — opted for this metallic striped Louis Vuitton number. The look was ruined by the oversized choker (she wore one to the Globes as well). We hope she ditches the accessory for the Oscars.
