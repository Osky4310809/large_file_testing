Samsung will hold its spring 'Unpacked' event today, on March 29th, and the new Galaxy S8 family will be the big focus of the event, but we also expect to hear news about a new Gear VR headset and an updated version of Samsung's 360Â° Gear 360 camera. And we will be liveblogging the event with all the juicy detail for all those who cannot tune in to the livestream for one reason or another. The Galaxy S8 family is expected to be the first of a new kind of 'bezel-less' smartphones by Samsung, with an impressive full-screen Super AMOLED display that will be curved towards the sides. The new S8 is also said to be the first one to come with the Snapdragon 835 system chip, the latest and most powerful processor by Qualcomm, built on a more effective 10nm process that should maximize both performance and battery life. The new Bixby Assistant is also expected to make its debut. For this and all else, tune in to our live blog of the Samsung Galaxy S8 announcement.
