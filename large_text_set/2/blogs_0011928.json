The families left to pick up the pieces are often further victimized by the legal system. There is power in numbers, and as our numbers grow, our voice grows. Now is the time to demand justice.This is no longer solely about Justice for Geo and is now about Justice for Canada. When Judge Anderson declared Richard Suter \"unimpaired\" based on 2 biased testimonies vs. 20+ unbiased witnesses and professional first responders stating their opinions that Suter was impaired, he not only hurt my family, he hurt our society. in 2016 Judge Anderson ripped open the loop hole Parliament closed in 2008. based only on the influence of his friend and mentor Dino Bottos, Judge Anderson took it upon himself to declare that Richard Suter was not impaired. We are now preparing for the biggest battle of all as we get ready to march up Parliament Hill and demand Justice for Geo from the Supreme Court of Canada!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:02:49.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
