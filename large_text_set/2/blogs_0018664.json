File photo \nMANILA, Philippines – The Department of Education on Wednesday reminded parents and schools that students cannot be required to join educational field trips. \n“The Department of Education is reminding parents, school officials and personnel that while educational field trips are meant to supplement classroom learning, joining such is not mandatory,” it said in a released statement. \nDepEd made the reminder in the wake of the fatal tourist bus accident in Tanay, Rizal, that injured 40 students and took the lives of 14 college students, a teacher and its driver last Monday. \nThe tourist bus was carrying students from Bestlink College of the Philippines who were supposed to go to Sacramento Adventure Camp for medical and survival training as part of their National Service Training Program (NSTP), an alternative program to the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. \nSome parents of Bestlink College students reportedly complained that their children were required to join the trip to pass their NSTP class. \nThe DepEd regulates elementary and secondary schools while colleges and universities are within the jurisdiction of the Commission on Higher Education. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nCHED has issued a temporary moratorium on field trips and educational tours in all public and private higher education institutions. Commissioner Prospero de Vera earlier called for the suspension of the school trips while investigation into a bus crash is ongoing. \nThe Education department urged all schools to verify the proper registration and road-worthiness of the buses and other vehicles to be used for trips, and ensure that the drivers have the appropriate know-how and frame of mind when on the road. \nIt cited DepEd Order No. 53 series of 2003, which stated that no activities or measures related to the trip which will put students who could not join the trip at a disadvantage shall be imposed. DepEd told heads and principals of public and private elementary and secondary schools that teachers must refrain from conducting tests based on these field trips, but students shall be given activities in school as substitute for not joining the trip. \nIn the same order, DepEd said all trips must secure consent from parents and that places to visit must be educational. The department said cultural and historical sites including science exhibit in museums are allowed while trips to malls and attendance at noon-time TV shows are discouraged. \n“These educational tours must be well-planned ahead of time with the students and safety measures should be discussed before the trip,” the department order said. \nDepEd also cited its Memorandum No. 529, series of 2009, reinforcing and directing strict compliance to existing policies against putting additional financial burden on the student’s parents who will shoulder monetary costs of the trip. —Rosette Adel Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:45:15.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
