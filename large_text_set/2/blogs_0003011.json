Built in 2004, the house has a game room with a full bar and a shaded balcony that overlooks the property. \nANOTHER TEXAS MANSION: Former UT Longhorns football coach's Austin home on the market for nearly $5 million \nThere's also a nanny's quarters with a separate entrance and private sauna. \nIn the kitchen, wood-paneled custom finishes, exposed brick architectural detail and a granite counter-top island that stretches almost the expanse of the room. \nThe master suite has a domed seating area with fireplace and bay window that offers serene panoramas of the heavily wooded nine-acre lot in The Woodlands's Grogan's Mill subdivision. \nOutside, two fully equipped summer kitchens have a view of the lot's mature trees and the home's serene swimming pool. Just beyond the patios is a waterfall-adjacent fire pit and seating area. \nCourtney Johnson Rose with George E. Johnson Properties has the listing.
