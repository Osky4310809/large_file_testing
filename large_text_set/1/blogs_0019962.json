The Chinese manufacturer launched the device in the US about three weeks ago , even though it was officially announced back in October of 2016.\nWe’ve come across a great deal on the Honor 6X at B&H. Unfortunately, the retailer isn’t offering a discount on the device, which means you’ll still have to fork out $249.99 to get it. However, it is throwing in a few extra goodies that have a total value of exactly $134.94. B&H Photo is giving out free JBL Synchros E40BT Bluetooth headphones as well as the Asus ZenPower Pro 10,050 mAh battery pack to customers who buy the Honor 6X.\nAs a refresher, the Honor 6X is a mid-range device that features a 5.5-inch 1080p display and is powered by the HiSilicon Kirin 655 chipset. It sports 3 GB of RAM and has 32 GB of on-board storage which can be expanded with the help of a microSD card. The 3,440 mAh battery keeps the lights on while the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner will keep your data is safe.\nSee also: Hands-on: The Honor Magic looks out of this world 2 weeks ago But the biggest selling point of the Honor 6X just might be the dual-camera setup with 12 and 2 MP sensors. The phone ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow on board but it will get updated to Android 7.0 Nougat eventually. The device is unlocked and is currently only available in gray, but it looks like the gold and silver color options will be in stock soon.\nIf you think this is a good deal and want to get it, visit the retailer’s website by clicking the button below.
