She said: “My road has a power cut! I wouldn’t give a s*** usually but I was enjoying watching ‘Stake Out!’” \nOne concerned parent living in Muswell Hill told the Standard: “If it’s not on by morning I can’t warm the babies’ milk. Blackout: More than 1,000 homes were affected.

We are moving house soon so our torches and candles are all packed so hopefully we won’t have to do a nappy change in the dark.” \nHelen Leake, who lives on Queens Avenue in Muswell Hill, said the lights in her house went out at just after 9pm. Candlelight: Many residents were without power for around an hour. (Lizzy Day) \nShe said: “No fun when you’re all electric. No heat is the main problem if it stays off for too long.” \nLizzy Day, who lives in Crouch End, said: “The power cut came on just before 9pm, I was cooking my dinner when the power went. \n“I’ve lived in the area for about seven years and it’s happened a few times.” Power cut in muswell hill! 😳 — Jessie Wallace (@JessieWallaceUK) February 1, 2017 Power cut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:29:32.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
