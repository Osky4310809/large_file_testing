Hopefully in Houston at Super Bowl LI. \nBut this isn’t a tale of goodwill — though many with Garland are — or of another kid just playing wherever Coach wants him. \n“How many guys would tell you it’s hard enough just to play on one side of the ball?” said Air Force coach Troy Calhoun. “You could go back to the 1940s or ’50s and this was done all the time, but the sport has become even more specialized. And here we have someone who has completely bucked the specialized notion by playing in all three facets. You have to be a really, really good football player to be able to do this. You do.” Football and service Master Sgt. Wolfram Stumpf, 140th Wing Public Affairs Garland is a captain in the 140th Public Affairs Wing of the Colorado Air National Guard. \nPractice at Dove Valley never really began until Garland took the field, and even then, it would take an additional 20 minutes for the stragglers to trot out. Garland was always first and typically always last, too: first in the building to watch film, first on the field to warm up and one of the last to leave. \nWhen asked why, Garland would often reflect on the time when he was about 5 years old and promised himself he would become an Air Force football player and then a Denver Bronco. But really, the “why” could be traced by nearly half a century over multiple generations of Garlands who served in the military. \n“The military has always been close to my heart,” he said. “I absolutely believe in everything it stands for, and it’s something I’ve always been passionate about. We have a long family tradition of the Garlands serving in the Air Force. There’s been a Colonel Garland in the Air Force ever since it separated from the Army.” \nBut the “why” also helps to explain the “how”: how a former college defensive lineman switched to offensive line in 2013 with the Broncos, helped them to Super Bowl XLVIII while continuing to study both sides on the practice squad, then moved up to starting left guard in the summer of 2015. And how that player fighting for his job on the field still finds time for others off the field. \nImmediately after the Broncos’ blowout loss to Seattle in Super Bowl XLVIII, Maj. Kinder Blacke in the 140th Wing was among the first to hear from Garland. \n“They lost and the very next day I got a call: ‘OK, so when I can come in?’ ” said Blacke, who oversees the wing’s public affairs office. \nAfter Garland fulfilled his two-year military commitment in 2012, he chose to continue his service and every offseason returns to Buckley to “do whatever they need me to do.” \nFirst Lt. Benjamin N. Garland is now Capt. Benjamin N. Garland, condensing the work of traditional guardsmen — one weekend every month plus 15 other days throughout the year — into each offseason. His hours in uniform are sandwiched between his hours of offseason training and, this year, the balancing act will again be difficult. \nHis football services are needed in Houston, shortening his time at Buckley. \n“I’d imagine if they are victorious then he’d probably take a little more time to celebrate that,” Blacke said. “And we’ll be happy to have him back whenever he wants.” Dual threat John Bazemore, The Associated Press Garland, right, working with Falcons center Alex Mack during practice ahead of the NFC championship. \nGarland isn’t one to volunteer specifics, but pry enough and he’ll give you this: He studies a lot. He’s in meetings a lot. He arrives early to study and leaves late to study some more. More than his usual. \n“Twice as much,” he said. “It’s a challenge, but that’s how I’ve chosen a lot of things in life. I wanted to go to the Air Force Academy because that’s a challenge. I wanted to play in the NFL because that’s a major challenge.” \nIt’s the test he craves. But this one gives cramming new meaning. \n“He has to study two game plans every week when most people just have to know their one side of the ball. He has to know both sides of the ball, all the audibles, all the checks, all the nuances,” explained Will Montgomery, the former Broncos center who Garland said took him under his wing in 2014. “It is a challenge to go from D-line to O-line, because defensive line you’re more attacking and you’re aggressive, whereas offensive line, you do want to attack it some, but there you need to be a little more balanced and be in more of that basketball posture where you’re not always lunging at a guy.” \nGarland is listed as a guard but, including the postseason, has played more snaps (51 to 48) on defense, while playing 181 more on special teams. \nIn the Falcons’ Week 5 win over the Broncos in Denver, it was Garland, the defensive lineman, who pushed past Matt Paradis and grabbed Paxton Lynch ’s ankles for a would-be sack. (It was nullified by a Falcons penalty.) Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:14:55.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
