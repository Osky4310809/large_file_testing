Durkin | 7:12 am, January 11th, 2017 video \nOn Tuesday night, Kellyanne Conway went into the belly of the beast on Late Night with Seth Meyers , the NBC late night show that has been most openly scathing of President-elect Donald Trump . While the two joked around about their idealogical differences, there was a clear air of respect, as host Seth Meyers foremost congratulated Conway on being the first female in history to successfully manage a presidential campaign. \nBut it didn’t take long for Meyers to pelt Conway with tough questions, foremost on the recent breaking news reports that the Kremlin has compromising information on the President-elect . But the interrogation over Russian involvement in our election didn’t stop there; Meyers, to his credit, likely viewed the Conway interview as his one direct shot at the transition team, and he didn’t let up. \n“Shouldn’t we care that the Russians tried to interfere?” he asked Conway. “I sometimes fear that the President-elect has no curiosity as to the amount they tried…” \n“That is completely false,” Conway shot back. “He has enormous curiosity. I’m there everyday with him,” she responded to audible gasps and laughs from the Late Night audience. \n“He has different meetings everyday, briefings and otherwise,” Conway continued. “He was curious enough to figure out America, he knew America when many other Republicans did not…” \nMeyers interrupted immediately. “That’s a pivot right there, Kellyanne!” Meyers said to applause from his crowd who recognized the frequent interview habit. “And by the way, no one does it better! Nobody does it better.” \nWatch above via NBC; the exchange begins around the 4:30 mark.— \nHave a tip we should know?
