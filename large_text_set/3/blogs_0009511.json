Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP \nMANILA, Philippines â€” Apologizing before the congressional Committee on Appointments, Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. admitted that he failed to fully disclose the status of his citizenship. \n\"I apologize for any inadvertent misleading that I might have made,\" Yasay told the panel Wednesday. \nThe country's top diplomat, however, insisted that he did not lie about his citizenship. \n\"There had been allegations that I had perjured and I have lied before this commission. I would like to state here and now again I did not lie,\" Yasay said. \nYasay stressed that he had always admitted that he had been granted American citizenship in November 1986 but was disqualified due to his preconceived intent to return to the Philippines. \nThe secretary defended himself, saying that it was only \"normal\" to come up with answers that he did not intend during his previous confirmation hearings. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \n\"I may not have fully disclosed what was required in my answering this question but this is really normal in a process like this when you are asked before a vast body like this, questions like the one asked of me. You get nervous, you somehow come up with answers that you do not intend and I apologize for that,\" the secretary said. \nEarlier this week, Yasay admitted in a television interview that he acquired a United States passport but had returned it together with his naturalization certificate. \nAcquiring an American passport implies that he had an American citizenship as it is required to provide evidence of US citizenship upon applying for one. \nIn his confirmation hearing a few weeks ago, Yasay claimed that he never held an American passport.
