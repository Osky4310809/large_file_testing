Virat Kohli blended temperament and a flurry of shots to engineer a remarkable triumph while chasing 351 in the first ODI. \nHowever, it was the dapper 31-year-old batsman, Kedar Jadhav, who stole the limelight with a stunning hundred. Numerous great tales have those moments where a hero emerges from obscurity to magically transform the contest. Jadhav did exactly that in the first ODI as he stitched a 200-run stand with Kohli after India found themselves in dire straits at 63 for 4. Even in the final ODI at the Eden Gardens, he launched fours and sixes with joyous abandon to take the home side to doorstep of victory before Chris Woakes bowled a brilliant final over to pull off a five-run win. \nSo what is in store for the three-match T20I series? Can the Eoin Morgan-led England side regroup and win the T20I series to salvage some pride from the tour? With the likes of Jos Buttler, Sam Billings, Ben Stokes, Morgan, Jason Roy and Co. in their ranks, they have the required firepower to dismantle opposition attacks. England's bowlers largely misfired during the ODI series. However, in the shortest format of the game, the visitors may just be able to cover up for the lack of penetration in the bowling department. \nTymal Mills will add a dose of potency to the bowling line-up. The Sussex pacer is quick and is a left-armer to boot. He was diagnosed with a congenital back condition in 2015 that threatened to end his career. However, he has been able to work his way back to fitness and nowadays has turned into a T20 specialist. The 24-year-old who started playing cricket only at 14 and wanted to pursue journalism, will be one of the players to watch out for. \nIndia, on the other hand, have decided to give opportunities for fresh faces like Yuzvendra Chahal, Mandeep Singh, Rishab Pant and Parvez Rasool. They have also rested the spin duo of Ashwin and Jadeja for the series. So the home side is looking at the three-match rubber as a long-term investment. \nWith India celebrating its 68th Republic Day, marking the commemoration of the day the nation's Constitution was adopted, one expects a packed house at the Green Park Stadium. With the stadium set to be engulfed by a jollity atmosphere, one hopes that it would turn out to be a cracker of a contest. \nAs per reports, there are a few clouds on the horizon in Kanpur. Hopefully, the rain will stay away... \nHere's our full preview. \nWe also have something on the tearaway Essex/Sussex quick Tymal Mills \nI'm Bharath Ramaraj, who will be with you through the course of the day's play.
