It's profiling,\" Seeles says in the repeated tagline of the videos.\nAccording to studies cited in the ads, there are an average of 10 times more tobacco ads in black neighborhoods than others, and tobacco retailers are much more likely to populate areas near low-income schools than schools in more affluent neighborhoods.\nThe focus on the discriminatory nature of tobacco advertising is a tack not often seen in anti-tobacco campaigns, which more often stick to showcasing the drug's brutal health effects.\nTruth is hoping this revelation will strike a chord with socially conscious millennials. Market research that the group did in preparation for the campaign found that young people were generally unaware of this particular problem, but were upset and angry upon learning about it.\n\"We are always looking for ways to help young people understand that, while Big Tobacco might not be top of mind for them, it in fact does impact their life,\" said Robin Koval, CEO and president of Truth Initiative.\nThe ads will make their national debut during the Grammys Sunday night.\nBONUS: These are the most talked about Super Bowl LI ads that you won't want to miss", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Df2qFtu2.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Df2qFtu2.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-12T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:07:14.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
