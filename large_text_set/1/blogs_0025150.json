We have fixed several bugs and improved usability of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core Tooling. Team Explorer connect experience is now improved to make it easier to find the projects and repos to which you want to connect. The Advanced Save option is back due to popular demand. Multiple installation-related issues are now fixed in this update, including hangs. We’ve also added a retry button when installation fails, disambiguated Visual Studio installs in the Start menu, and added support for creating a layout for offline install. \nApart from these improvements you’ll notice that we’ve removed the Data Science and Python Development workloads. As we’ve been closing on the VS release, some of the components weren’t going to meet all the release requirements, such as translation to non-English languages. They’ll re-appear soon as separate downloads. F# is still available in the .NET Desktop and .NET Web development workloads. \nPlease try this latest update and share your feedback. For problems, let us know via the Report a Problem option in the upper right corner of the VS title bar. Track your feedback on the developer community portal . For suggestions, let us know through UserVoice .
