You think we’re not going to focus on the name ‘HAND. SALAD’?\nHand Salad, to be clear, is salad that you eat with your hands like a ravenous beast forced to eat lettuce instead of carbs.\nBut it’s not even a proper salad, with different types of vegetables and deliciousness.\nIt’s literally just romaine f***ing lettuce leaves and a fancy dip.\nIt's called a \"hand salad\" but let's not focus on that https://t.co/fRTxgR79cY pic.twitter.com/XWY0mbAqF4 \n— Bon AppĂŠtit (@bonappetit) March 27, 2017 \n\nThat’s it. It’s not even crudites and dip. Just sad, lonely lettuce you must dunk into dip.\nBon AppĂŠtit describe ‘hand salad’ as an appetiser for a dinner party.\nBon AppĂŠtit are out of their f***ing minds.\nIf I arrived at someone’s house hungry and awaiting delicious food, and they presented me with leaves and sauce, I would leave, order some spaghetti to my house, and never return to that person’s home again.\nClearly, I am not alone in this intense feeling of rage and disgust, because Bon AppĂŠtit’s tweets about ‘hand salad’ have been mercilessly mocked.\nme eating hand bread but lets not focus on that @ bonappetit https://t.co/EESl55R8s9 \n— \ndarth™ (@darth) March 27, 2017 .@ bonappetit https://t.co/bDFcZAdl78 \n— \ntar heel hound 🏀 (@zandywithaz) March 27, 2017 @ bonappetit Pair your hand salad with a \"stick meat\" for a great midday meal! https://t.co/lTeyiUhTOR \n— \nJadeinNM (@Jadeinnm) March 27, 2017 .@ bonappetit just whipped up a quick bowl of cereal https://t.co/0U3UGe5ThL \n— \nJuggalocialism (@UweBollocks) March 27, 2017 @ bonappetit We call that leaves & sauce where I'm from.\n— \nRich (@HeightMen) March 27, 2017 @ bonappetit Western civilization is done now.
