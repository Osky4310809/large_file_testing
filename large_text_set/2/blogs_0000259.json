It’s because you guys keep making the same mistakes,” Lewis said. “I sit back and I think to myself — do you all think he’s going to change?” \nAnd it’s that simplicity — “the poetry and beauty” as Lewis calls it — that he thinks is a common thread of greatness. \n“I don’t think guys appreciate how simple the game of football really is,” Lewis said. \nDon’t believe Lewis? Let him give you an example: \n“When we played in childhood, the game plan was simply ‘go get open’. That’s what Tom tells his receivers — go get open. He’s playing you outside leverage — go inside. He’s playing you inside leverage — go outside. \n“When we played them [as a member of the Ravens], I used to always say to [teammates] ‘this is schoolyard football’. Beat your man, dammit. If you have a problem beating your man, that’s when Tom’s coming.” \n“You’re flatfooted, you’re sitting 12 yards off, and you don’t think he’s going to throw that hitch? He’s going to throw it 10 times out of 10.” \nThe result? \nWell, Brady isn’t in Houston by accident. Said Lewis: \n“People can hate on him, y’all can be mad at him, but he’s the best quarterback we’ve ever seen.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:39:55.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
