That’s not right, that’s not right. That’s not fair. That’s not the open democratic process,” he told NBC.\nA 30-year veteran of Congress and leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Lewis said he would not attend Trump’s inauguration. “It will be the first one that I’ll miss since I’ve been in the Congress,” he said. “You cannot be at home with something that you feel is wrong.”\nLewis is not the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to skip the event. California congresswoman Barbara Lee has said she does not feel she can attend because of Trump’s campaign of “racism, sexism, xenophobia and bigotry.”\nInauguration should be a celebration. But we have nothing to celebrate on Jan 20. Instead of attending, I will be organizing. pic.twitter.com/P4whhl91ll \n— Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) January 12, 2017 \nTrump has yet to respond to the statement, but few onlookers would struggle to see the irony of any rage coming from a man who spent years perpetuating the “birther” lie designed to discredit Barack Obama’s presidency.\nIt’s worth noting that this type of discord is likely to be exactly what the Kremlin wants: having got a sympathetic figure elected to the White House, it can only help Vladimir Putin’s efforts to rebalance the global order if the US president faces a legitimacy crisis at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:59:58.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
