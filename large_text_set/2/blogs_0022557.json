Soda pops have been replaced by green juices. Greasy meals have been replaced by wholesome salads. Hangovers are no longer considered cool, because you'd rather kick off your day with yoga than a debilitating headache. And vacations include some kind of healthy activity. If you are looking for that perfect destination for your dream wellness vacation, but don't know where to start, look no further. Here's a list of six places, within India and abroad, that you could head to if you want to come back truly rejuvenated. In India, head to... \nSource North of the Buddhist city of Dharamshala, and home to the Dalai Lama, lies McLeodganj. The hill town has abundant yoga, reiki, and ayurveda centres. From mud shacks to huge halls, you can find any ambience and style you are looking for. Two kilometres north of McLeodganj is Bhagsu, a small town full of cafes and more yoga and ayurveda centres. Many of the travellers here come with the sole purpose of practicing the ancient science. So, you can always find company in the like-minded strangers, all on the same path of seeking spiritual guidance. Goa \nSource Yes, believe it or not, Goa isn't meant only for raves. There are many yoga and ayurveda centres in both north and south Goa, including the party hub, Anjuna. Again, people from all over the world hail to this beach state both for the ocean, as well as healing. Puducherry and Auroville \nSource The French town in south India is home to Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Spend your time here meditating, doing pranayama, or practicing asanas, or simply being in the company of other spiritual seekers. About 15 kilometres from Puducherry is the experimental township of Auroville. With a population of about 50,000 people from all over the world, this township is based on the concept of unity in diversity. That all of us, regardless of our age, gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, are one. This is true spirituality, and what the world is meant to be like, and what we strive for. But, Auroville is perhaps the only place where you can truly experience a melting pot. Abroad, head to... \nSource Bali is one of the leading destinations, worldwide, for a wellness and spa vacation. So, yes, if you love to move, but love spa days just as much, head to this tropical island. Ubud in Bali is the hub of spas, detox centres, and yoga-based wellness centres. You can also find other alternative therapies, including some indigenous treatments using traditional, local ingredients. Some spas also offer wine and caviar! Well, it's worth a try. Turkey \nSource Yes, Turkey is one of the popular wellness destinations in the world. With spas that offer herbal treatments, among other things, natural hot springs, as well as thermal springs, Turkey has much to offer. Don't skip the traditional Turkish bath, called hamam , where an attendant will wash and scrub you for about 15 minutes, after which you can soak in the bath. You can also try other services offered at hamams , which include a head massage, facial clay masks, and reflexology. Sri Lanka \nSource Sri Lanka is another destination you can consider if you are looking to indulge in some ayurvedic treatments, and yoga. There are many retreat centres that you can take your pick from. And, in your free time, walk along the beach and the tree-lined streets, and soak in the sun, the clear blue skies, and the unmatched fresh air!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:22.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
