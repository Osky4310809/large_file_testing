I am reaching out to you today after learning of President Trump’s executive order demanding a wall to be built along the border of our nation and Mexico. I am reaching out to you today after reading about each and every environmental disaster that President Trump is ordering, from the restarting of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline constructions, to the intended withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, to the appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to Secretary of State and climate denier Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency, to the blacking out of media communications from the EPA and National Parks Service. And for all of this, I say “I’m sorry”. To the people and governments of the world, I am sorry. I am sorry that the country that I call home has elected such a destructive figure to the highest office in the land. I am sorry that we are not living up to our potential as a benefactor to the world. I am sorry our government is plagued by lobbyists, isolationists, and greedy self-indulging billionaires pushing personal agendas. I am sorry that immigrants from your countries are fearing for their safety and their lives. I am sorry that you have to watch as our once great nation falls into the hands of blind nationalists and fascists. And, worst of all, I am sorry that I did not do more to prevent this. To the people and governments of the world, I, too, am fearful. I am fearful that irreparable damage will be done to the world in the next four or more years. I am fearful that those who have no voice will continue to be drowned out, and that those who profit billions of dollars off of regular people will continue to do so. I am fearful that I may no longer love my country, a country that I have looked up to as a symbol of morality and freedom for so long. I am fearful that a people I love and admire, the American people, are being taken advantage of by another billionaire businessman. I am fearful that while my fellow Americans are stricken by poverty and starvation, our government will only propagate and amplify their suffering. And I am fearful that other governments will deem this acceptable. To the people and governments of the world, I want you to know that President Trump, while he is, on paper, my president, does not represent me. I want you to know that the views, policies, and actions of the government of the United States of America do not reflect those of the citizens of the United States of America. I want you to know that I love my country the people of this great nation; the selfless fathers and hardworking mothers, empathetic sons, and brilliant daughters. I want you to know that separation of church and state is something that should be religiously upheld, and that no person should be judged by anything except the strength of their character. I want you to know that Americans are a people of love, not hate; a people of strength, not fear; and a people of truth at all costs. I want you to know that we, the people who do not stand for hate, will continue to fight for morality until our last breath. To the people and governments of the world, please do not write us off. Please separate differences in opinion from differences in humanity. Please recognize that, as the land of the free and the home of the brave, we are not living up to our potential. But please understand that we, the people of the United States of America, support building bridges, not walls; support a global community that lifts everyone up; and support the life and liberty of each and every human being; because We the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:22:59.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
