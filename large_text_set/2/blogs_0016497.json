Could   \nTim Sherwood could be set for an emotional return to Blackburn to replace the sacked Owen Coyle. \nSherwood captained Blackburn to the Premier League title in 1995 and is understood to be under consideration by owners Venky’s. \nRovers’ director of football Paul Senior is playing a key role in choosing Coyle’s successor and Sherwood worked with him at Tottenham when he was Spurs boss. \nSherwood, 48, who also managed Aston Villa, is currently director of football at Swindon and has been in that role since November. \nVenky’s axed Coyle yesterday with the club next to bottom of the Championship with just one win in their last 13 league games. \nIt is understood the players were unhappy with Coyle’s coaching methods and a group of them voiced their concerns just before he was sacked. Former Blackburn Rovers manager Owen Coyle (Photo: Action Images / Paul Burrows) \nThey felt the former Burnley, Bolton and Wigan boss was not doing enough tactical and analysis work with them. \nIt is believed Senior also had reservations about Coyle, who was appointed in June. \nThe players thought Coyle had gone last week when they were told he would not be taking training one day. \nHe survived for Blackburn’s battling defeat to Manchester United in the FA Cup on Sunday, but Venky’s pulled the plug on Tuesday to begin the search for their ninth permanent manager since taking over in November 2008. \nVenky’s have also sacked his backroom staff of assistant Sandy Stewart, first-team coach John Henry and goalkeeping coach Phil Hughes to make way for their new manager.
