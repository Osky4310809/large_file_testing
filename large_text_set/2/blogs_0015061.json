Yesterday, it was Duncan Castles claiming that Chelsea are “pursuing” the €80m-man . Today, it’s Oliver Kay saying that Chelsea are set to offer that amount for the 22-year-old, and his story is backed up by somewhat related quotes from Monaco vice-president Vasim Vasilyev. “Yes, yes [there have been inquiries for Bernardo Silva]. I really don’t want to go into details, but for all our major players, we do have interest from major European clubs.” “This is not the right time to talk about it. Let’s finish the season and then we can look at our project for next season. Me, the coach and the players are focused on this season.” -Vasim Vasilyev; source: Times While Vasilyev does confirm interest, his confirmation is vague and unspecific and fairly useless. Bernardo’s one of the hottest players potentially available in the summer transfer window, so of course most big teams (who are the only teams able to afford him) will be interested. Vasilyev does not name any names, so all have to go on is the Times’ angle, which, for now anyway, seems to be firmly Chelsea-centric. So we’ve got that going for us, which I guess is nice. Per yesterday’s story, Monaco’s express intent is to create a “money-spinning auction” for Bernardo Silva. They’re off to a pretty good start in that aim, I’d say.
