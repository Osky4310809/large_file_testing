Coffee Shop Goes Cashless February 2, 2017 5:53 PM By Devin Bartolotta \nBALTIMORE (WJZ) — After being robbed a handful of times in the past few months, one Baltimore coffee shop is no longer accepting cash to stop the robberies and keep their staff safe. \nNowadays, many people don’t carry cash in their wallets day-to-day, and at Park Cafe in Bolton Hill, cash payments are no longer on the menu. \n“We’re not going to accept cash anymore,” said Park Cafe & Coffee owner David Hart. “I’m going to take that out of the equation.” \nPark Cafe was robbed five times from October to January. While the armed suspect is now behind bars, those crimes pushed Hart to ditch the cash drawer altogether. \nMost patrons are on board. \n“I would say virtually 90 percent of them have said, ‘Listen, you needed to do what you needed to do to protect yourself and protect your staff. We will continue to support you,'” said Hart. \nHart said cash normally makes up 22 percent of Park Cafe’s revenue, but so far, they haven’t seen any change in their income since going cashless. \nThe coffee shop is working with a church and local pharmacy to find solutions for customers who only carry cash. \nAlthough Park Cafe is card-only for safety reasons, cash use is on the decline nationwide, with only 10 percent of Americans now using cash only. \n62 percent of people predict the U.S. will be a cashless society in their lifetime. \nBut there are two sides to this, as not everyone carries cards. \n“I don’t use cards. I’ve seen too many of my friends that have lost everything they had with credit cards,” said one Baltimore resident. \n“My mom, she doesn’t use plastic,” said Bolton Hill resident Lenora Lewis. “She still writes checks, still do cash.” \nLoyola assistant professor J.P. Krahel tells WJZ’s Devin Bartolotta that a cashless society could leave some behind. \n“The problem is, going cashless tends to benefit the wealthier members of society and tends to hurt the poorer ones,” said Krahel. \nBut for this Baltimore business, cash is taking a back seat to safety. \n  Devin Bartolotta Devin Bartolotta joined the WJZ Eyewitness News team in July of 2016   reporter.
