Everyone doubts he WILL play at a high level. metalhead65 says: Feb 24, 2017 9:09 AM \nhopefully he will go to a team that runs a offense that fits his skills. it was not all his fault during his time with the bears, name another team that give up what they did to get him then say what he did with the broncos was nice but we do not do that here. while the bears did not have the talent the broncos did how hard would it have been to have a offense that featured his strengths? that would be like getting rodgers then saying do not throw the deep ball and believe me if lovie were the coach that is what they would have done! his idea of offense is get off the bus running until the last 2 min. of the game and then ok win the game for us now and then act shocked when it does not happen or when turn overs happen. seriously how does anyone expect a qb to be successful when you have to learn a new offense every year?

Feb 24, 2017 9:13 AM \nThat would be a first. stoneydog1000 says: Feb 24, 2017 9:15 AM \nAnd, Jay Cutler thinks Josh McCown can play at a very low level. jjackwagon says: Feb 24, 2017 9:16 AM \nSo McCown thinks that Cutler is going back to Denver?
