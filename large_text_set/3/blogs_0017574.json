Many of us have seen Beauty and the Beast this weekend and are still hopped up on that. But the only Emma Watson-related content I’ve managed to care about is watching her being interviewed by Buzzfeed while playing with kittens.\nI don’t know what’s more adorable: the widdle white kittens themselves, or the fact that Watson can barely concentrate on the questions she’s being asked (that were sent in to Buzzfeed by fans about Beauty and the Beast ), because she’s distracted by the cuteness.\nI feel you, Emma. I’d totally not give a crap about my promotional duties either. Not in the face of all that adorable!\n(via MuggleNet.com, featured image via screenshot)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
