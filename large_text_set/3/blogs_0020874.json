A puffy appearance Shutterstock \n“If you consume too much dietary salt, your skin and parts of your body may appear puffy due to water retention,\" says Angie Murad, RDN, LD from the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program. Sonya Angelone, M.S., R.D.N., CLT, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, agrees, adding that the puffiness is likely to show around the eyes as well as swelling in the fingers and ankles. 3 of 8 2. Excessive thirst. Shutterstock \nIncreased salt intake leads to dehydration. As a result, exercisers may notice that they need to drink more often especially when training, says Murad. Some heavy exercisers may even notice a salty, sweaty film around their lips during workouts, says Angelone. \"This is because your body is trying to lose the excess salt in your body,” she says. 4 of 8 3. Frequent urination. Shutterstock \nNot only are you likely to head to the bathroom more often when you eat too much salt, but your urine is likely to be darker and thicker. While this might not seem like it’s serious, you lose calcium when you urinate. “If there isn’t enough calcium in the blood, then the body will take calcium from bones,” says Murad. As a result, people who consume more salt over time may be at higher risk for osteoporosis. 5 of 8 4. Unhealthy food preferences. Shutterstock \nIf you eat too much salt, you may lose interest in more healthy foods. People who overconsume salt are not likely to taste the flavors of healthy, unadulterated food, says Angelone. “To them,” she says, “natural food tastes funny.” Heavy salt consumers may develop a preference for saltier foods as a result. “You may not become a salt addict, but you can definitely have a taste preference for salty foods like processed foods; lunch meat, bacon, sausage, ham, and soups,” says Murad. 6 of 8 5. Muscle cramps. Shutterstock \nExercisers may notice tighter muscles more often if they overuse the saltshaker or overconsume salty foods. Sodium and calcium are responsible for muscle contraction, explains Angelone. Potassium on the other hand, helps muscles to relax. If you upset the sodium-potassium balance, you may notice more muscle soreness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:43:59.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
