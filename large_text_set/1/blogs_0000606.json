With a Skylake CPU, fast DDR4 memory, and lots of customizability, this PC is a fantastic bargain when you use today’s coupon.\n• Dell XPS 8900 quad-core desktop PC for $599.99 (List price: $1045.85 — Coupon code: XPS599 )\n\nOkay, so what kind of specs are we dealing with here? This model has a sixth generation quad-core 3.4GHz Intel Core i7-6700 CPU, a discrete Nvidia GeForce GT 730 graphics card (with 2GB of memory), 8GB of DDR4 RAM (2133MHz), a 1TB 7200RPM hard drive, a DVD-RW drive, Bluetooth 4.0, and 802.11b/g/n/ac WiFi support. \nA wired keyboard and mouse combo come along for free, and the built-in HDMI port makes it easy to hook up to just about any modern PC monitor or HDTV. In need of DVI or DisplayPort support? Check out Amazon and MonoPrice for affordable adaptors. \nOut of the box, this machine will be able to run some 3D games, but most recent releases are a bit much for the default graphics card to handle. Thankfully, you can easily turn this into a gaming rig without breaking the bank. Invest in an affordable card like a Radeon RX 480 (about $250 on Amazon), open up the case, and swap out the GT 730 that comes with the machine. The CPU and memory are already superb, so you’ll be ready to play once the new graphics card is in place. \nWindows 7 Professional (64-bit) comes installed automatically, but you’ll have the opportunity to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro (64-bit) as well. If you choose to make the jump to Windows 10, you’ll benefit from loads of new features. With game DVR, DirectX 12, and local game streaming, Windows 10 has a lot to offer from a gaming perspective. Add in the new Edge browser, Cortana, and the Windows Store, and you’ll find that Microsoft’s new OS is a stellar option.\nOrdinarily, this config lists for $1045.85, but Dell is selling it for $649.99 online. Use coupon code “ XPS599 ” in your shopping cart, and you’ll save an additional $50 off. Shipping is free as well, so you’ll be saving even more when you choose the three-to-five business day shipping option.\nOur commerce group sources the best deals and products for the Geek Deals posts.
