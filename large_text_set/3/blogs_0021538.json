(Photo: Ivan Pierre Aguirre, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNorth Carolina quarterback Mitchell Trubisky posted a solid pro day workout in front of NFL scouts Tuesday afternoon. \nLed by former Arizona Cardinals quarterback Ryan Lindley, his quarterbacks coach throughout the pre-draft process, Trubisky completed 54 of 63 passes in a crisp workout that showcased his arm strength, accuracy and mobility. \nFour of Trubisky’s nine incompletions were drops, three of which were catchable but thrown behind the targets. \nThe other five incompletions were overthrown. One was on a short pass to a running back in the flat, two came on intermediate wheel routes and two were on deep passes. \nMORE COVERAGE: NFL mock draft 3.0: Who's rising after combine? \nTrubisky started with short passes then cycled to intermediate and deep throws. He concluded his pro day workout with red zone throws. \nA one-year starter at UNC, he is competing with Clemson’s Deshaun Watson and Notre Dame’s DeShone Kizer to be the first passer selected in the NFL draft. \nTrubisky said he has individual team workouts scheduled with the Cleveland Browns, New York Jets, San Francisco 49ers, and Kansas City Chiefs, among others. He added that he plans to be on hand in Philadelphia for the first day of the NFL draft on April 27. \nNo head coaches were present for North Carolina’s pro day, though at least two general managers, John Lynch of the San Francisco 49ers and Jerry Reese of the New York Giants, attended. According to the University, 75 scouts watched the workout. \nTrubisky did not run the 40-yard dash or go through any other drills at his pro day, but measured in at 6-foot-2 and 217 pounds, down five from his measured weight at the NFL scouting combine held earlier this month. \nPHOTOS: Notable NFL players on the move Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
