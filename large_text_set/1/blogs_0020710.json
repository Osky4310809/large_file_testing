Sonu Nigam turns street musician for social experiment \nIf we rewind back two years, the time frame alone should suffice in throwing up dozens of protests that have taken place in our country – a mass revolting for rights that should have been accorded to citizens in the first place; whether it’s been women’s safety, fighting against the criminalisation of Section 377 or the price of onions – it’s never been so important for us to voice out our opinions until now and as the time passes by we have got more creative about it. Art and protest have a long, torrid history with censorship always just kept at bay. An anomaly, you would think, in a democratic state. \nAs India celebrates its 68th Republic Day on January 26, 2917, here are few musicians who took this plunge and composed their hearts out for the causes that mattered the most to them! Scroll down and check out how the likes of AR Rahman , Sonu Nigam, Shalmali Kholgade and other musicians are creating anthems to highlight the various evils that ail our society! From the urgent need to empower our women and eradicate gender inequality to calling for united efforts to end terrorism and wage a war against genocide and malnutrition… these music maestros have tried to highlight the grim realities of the world we live in in the most heartening way! Take a look… A R Rahman \nA R Rahman: A R Rahman’s album Raunaq launched in September 2014 as a complete dedication to Women Empowerment. The album’s title track had a track “laadli” which Rahman sang along with Lata Mangeshkar and lyrics were penned down by Kapil Sibal! \n\nShalmali Kholgade \nShalmali Kholgade: Shalmali who has given Bollywood some of the most memorable chartbusters launched her first single “Aye” – a song that personifies gender equality and vouches for no discrimination. It isn’t a plea for women being superior but a perspective to keep things equal between both the sexes. The video has been directed by Shalmali herself and the song too has been composed by the talented musician. Aye has strong choreography and visuals reiterating its core concept of gender equality.
