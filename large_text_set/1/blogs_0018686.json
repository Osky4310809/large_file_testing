The musician is seven months pregnant, and she played a few older songs for the audience — like “Serpent,”“Lucky Stars,” and “Don’t Do It”— on top of two fresh ones. Beirut, Kevin Morby, Hand Habits, and Daniel Rossen also performed, and the second night of the benefit series goes down tonight at Rough Trade . On top of writing new music, Van Etten recently appeared in the Netflix series The OA , and she has been cast in Twin Peaks as well. Check out fan-shot footage from her performance below.
