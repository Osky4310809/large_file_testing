This Latest Liberal ‘Excuse’ For Hillary’s Loss Is The Craziest One Yet \nWhat has changed is where the oil is coming from – which is private and state-owned lands inside the United States, where the modern miracles of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) and horizontal shale drilling are on their way to making the U.S. the OPEC of the 21 st century. \nObama and his party can claim credit for exactly none of that progress, since they have done everything they could to keep energy exploration off of federal lands, and inhibit production on private and state-owned lands with regulations to please their liberal wind and solar power bases. \nA Twitter posting picked up by The Daily Caller, from University of Colorado-Boulder Professor Roger Pielke Jr., made the point clearly. Untrue US oil consumption is greater Jan 2017 than in Jan 2009 We traded foreign oil for US fracked oil #getitright https://t.co/ynbclYj6pn https://t.co/bqWsk2R6PC \n— Roger Pielke Jr. (@RogerPielkeJr) January 2, 2017 \nPielke is a political science professor, not petroleum geologist, so his take is probably purely from the political spectrum, but the facts don’t change just because of the point of view involved. \nAnd the facts are, Obama has spent eight years preaching the alleged virtues of “renewable” energy – remember the crony capitalist Solyndra scam? — and trying to smother the oil, natural gas and coal industries with ever-increasing regulation. \nStill, the country has managed to halve its oil imports while increasing the amount of oil products it used – and it wasn’t windmill farms or fancy solar paneling that did it. \nAs Prof. Pielke put it in another Twitter posting: Progressives must learn that they will have far more credibility critiquing Trump’s propaganda machine if the rein in their own. \n— Roger Pielke Jr. (@RogerPielkeJr) January 2, 2017 \nProgressives rein in their propaganda machine? That horse left the barn a long, long time ago. \nThe point here is that even in the final days of his presidency, Obama is compelled to distort facts to try to fashion some sort of legacy that allows him to steal credit for the United States increasing energy independence – something that he not only did not accomplish, but actually did his utmost to keep from happening. \nIt’s of a piece, really, with the liberal propensity to distort reality to meet a political agenda, like calling Obama’s appeasement to Iran in the nuclear deal a diplomatic success. \nBut the energy claim is so far off base even liberals should have trouble standing up for it. And the fact that the White House was so willing to put out such a blatant skewering of the truth shows just what the country narrowly escaped by rejecting the election of Hillary Clinton, Obama’s chosen successor, to the Oval Office. \nAfter eight years of lies, one more shouldn’t matter all that much…but it does. \nIt really does.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:49:14.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
