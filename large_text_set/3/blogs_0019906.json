(NASA) \n2016 was the planet’s undisputed warmest year on record. Because of a cyclical cooling of the oceans, few expected temperatures in 2017 to follow its superheated course. \nBut 2017 has started off plenty toasty, ranking second warmest in recorded history, according to data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last Friday . And you can’t rule out it catching up to 2016. \nNOAA said the planet’s temperature in February was 1.76 degrees above the 20th-century average, 0.3 degrees below the record warm February in 2016. Global temperature difference from average in February 2017. (NOAA) \n“Warmer- to much-warmer-than-average conditions were present across much of the world’s land surfaces, with the most notable warm temperature departures from average across much of the contiguous U.S., southeastern Canada, and across much of central and eastern Russia,” NOAA’s report said. [ The nation’s freaky February warmth was assisted by climate change ] \nNorth America had its warmest February since 2000 and its fourth warmest on record, NOAA added. \nArctic temperatures have been especially warm in recent months. In fact, they ranked highest in recorded history for the period between December and February according to Berkeley Earth , a nonprofit group that analyzes temperature data. The last three months were the warmest winter (Dec-Feb) in the #Arctic since record keeping began. pic.twitter.com/LyDPqZhTUl \n— Robert Rohde (@rarohde) March 11, 2017 \nEven so, the warmth to start 2017 is somewhat less intense than 2016 for the globe overall because of the absence of a strong El Niño event. Such events tend to raise ocean temperatures in the eastern and central tropical Pacific Ocean and, by extension, air temperatures around the world. In early 2016, one of the strongest El Niños on record nudged global temperatures to all-time highs. \nDuring the summer and into the fall of 2016, the El Niño was gradually replaced by a La Niña event and ocean and air temperatures leveled off some. \nBut La Niña was declared dead in February and tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures are rising again. Air temperatures have begun to increase in response. NOAA said the February 2017 global temperature anomaly, or difference from normal, was the highest since April 2016. \nIf Pacific Ocean temperatures continue to warm and an El Niño event re-develops, this will translate into an even warmer atmosphere. It would then be possible for 2017 to give 2016 a run for its money for the warmest year on record. [ La Niña is out and El Niño may be coming, and here’s what that means for our weather ] Time series of 2017 temperature difference from average compared to eight other warmest years on record. (NOAA) \nRobert Rhode, lead scientist for Berkeley Earth, said the increasing temperature anomalies to start 2017 put it in a strong position to outrank 2016 as warmest year. “Our simple statistical model is suggesting a roughly 65 percent chance of 2017 being warmer than 2016,” he posted to Twitter . With both January and February 2017 being warmer than the 2016 average, the odds of 2017 finishing warmer than 2016 continues to increase. pic.twitter.com/48rsfvmOXK \n— Robert Rohde (@rarohde) March 11, 2017 \nThe chance is only 12 percent, countered Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at NASA who directs the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “Month-to-month we’re significantly colder than last year [at the same time],” he said. \nDeke Arndt, who runs NOAA’s climate monitoring branch, said it is too early in the year to make a firm prediction about where 2017 will rank. “There are a lot of what-ifs,” he said. “But I do think it’s going to be one of the warmest years.” \nSchmidt and Arndt both said they think too much emphasis is placed on a given year’s exact rank. “Comparing one year to another is interesting and provides some insights, but it doesn’t really confirm or refute anything that looking at the whole record does,” Arndt said. \nIf you’re overweight and gain or lose a few pounds compared to the previous year, Arndt explained, it means very little. But if you’re 30 pounds heavier than you were a decade ago, “in a bigger picture that’s what’s more important”, he said. \nThe near-record warm February fits neatly into the long-term trend toward higher temperatures. According to Climate Central, a nonprofit science communications firm based in Princeton, N.J., the rate of February temperature increase has doubled since 1980. It said 15 of the 20 warmest Februaries on record have occurred since 2000 and none before 1983. \nEvery one of the last 41 Februaries have been warmer than the 20th-century average, NOAA said. \nIn independent analyses of February’s global surface temperature data, NASA and Berkeley Earth also found the month ranked second warmest on record. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:40:30.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
