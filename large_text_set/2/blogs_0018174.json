She was first exposed to the practice during a trip to Washington hospital over 10 years ago. \nResidents of Indiana have attested to Pence’s dedication to the cause.

So her being at that level definitely gives us a very much broader audience and understanding of the field to educate,” said Tami Harris, President of the Indiana Art Therapy Association. \nPence has also observed art therapy programs in Japan, Germany, Israel and Canada. \nEven though she received a master’s degree in art education, Pence thinks art therapy wasn’t something she’d be “qualified to do.” Advertisement - story continues below Video Shows The Moment When A Fallen Soldier Makes It Home \nAlthough art therapy isn’t usually covered by heath insurers, Pence doesn’t feel it’s her place to try and encourage companies to provide for it. She simply wants to use her platform to bring awareness. \n“I don’t really see my role as policy maker or policy changer,” Pence said. “I just want to make people aware of what art therapy is.” \nAccording to the American Art Therapy Association , those specializing in the practice can expect their clients to see a wide range of health benefits. \nA statement on their website reads: “Art therapy is a mental health profession in which clients, facilitated by the art therapist, use art media, the creative process, and the resulting artwork to explore their feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self-awareness, manage behavior and addictions, develop social skills, improve reality orientation, reduce anxiety, and increase self-esteem. A goal in art therapy is to improve or restore a client’s functioning and his or her sense of personal well-being.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
