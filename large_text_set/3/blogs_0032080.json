Certainly well-deserved after hitting .271 with a .798 OPS, 33 doubles and 33 homers last year in his age-22 season. Yeah, I didn’t think he was that young, either. But he is, and now he’s a rich 23-year-old. Not only that, but he’s now the proud owner of two horses for his ranch, which he negotiated as part of his contract extension with the Rangers. \nI love this move, but it’s also a pretty wild move at the same time. Of course, Odor isn’t the first player to negotiate some unconventional perk into their new deal. I’m pretty sure Rollie Fingers had a clause in his contract where he got paid extra for having a mustache. But as far as common perks go, guys will negotiate things like suites at every hotel when the team is on the road, box seats for home games, drivers on the road, translators, a specific jersey number, and bonuses for personal awards. But horses? That’s a new one for me. \nLike I said, it’s a smart move by Odor. He probably could’ve asked for anything, and the Rangers would’ve done it. You put up numbers like those at that age, and fuck yeah you can ask for some horses to sign an extension, especially if you’re allowing the team to buy out three arbitration years and two years of free agency, which could technically end up being three if that option year gets picked up. \nI don’t even know what I’d ask for as a weird perk in my contract extension if I were a pro athlete. Probably a statue of me outside the ballpark, and a bobblehead night once a month with a different action shot of me doing something awesome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:27:28.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
