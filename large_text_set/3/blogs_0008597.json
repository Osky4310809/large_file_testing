Saturday Night Live: Scarlett Johansson gives political jokes some bite Read more \nOn Last Week Tonight, the comic took apart the American Health Care Act, championed by the House speaker, Paul Ryan, saying: “You may not have wanted it, it looks awful but it’s here anyway” which he likened to “Pirates of the Caribbean 5: The Curse of Johnny Depp Getting Divorced & Needing the Money”. \nHe then discussed the negative reaction the bill has already encountered, even from many Republicans. “Much like the life behind Melania’s eyes, the AHCA looks dead by the time it was introduced in Washington,” he said. \nOliver called it “shitty Obamacare, the way Old Navy is a shitty version of the Gap” before talking about the mechanics of the plan. Older people will get more money towards their healthcare, leading him to joke: “The older you get, the more money you get. Think of it as the exact opposite of being a woman in Hollywood.” \nDespite all of the negativity, Ryan has been doing the publicity circuit, explaining why the bill is so great. Oliver joked during one of his TV calls-ins that “somehow you can almost hear his erection during that”. \nHe then played the much criticized clip of Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz recommending that people should reconsider buying an iPhone if they plan to need any form of healthcare. \n“It’s frankly a little hard to take a lecture on good choices from a man who presumably entered a barbershop and said, ‘Give me the wet poodle pubes,’” Oliver said. \nHe then highlighted that the people who will be most affected by the reform will be poorer Americans who voted for Trump. “It’s like if the people in Pompeii voted for the volcano,” he said.

The ad will feature an older actor explain in detail how his life will be harder from now on. It will air in the Washington DC area on Wednesday morning.
