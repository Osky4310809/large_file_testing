You don’t do that.”\nLive PD trails police officers in the country’s busiest forces on Friday nights and offers “unfettered and unfiltered live access” to their operations, A&E said on its website. It is broadcast in real time in an attempt to offer transparency in policing, particularly at a time of heightened tensions between law enforcement and communities they patrol following high-profile fatal police shootings over the past few years.\nLive PD and A&E executive producer David Doss told another local news outlet that Benjamin Johnson’s body was accidentally broadcast before they knew he was dead. He said cameras panned away as soon as producers realized what was happening.\nOfficers arrived after Benjamin Johnson had been shot, and after his killer fled the scene. The Richland County Sheriff’s Department, which granted A&E permission to tag along, did not immediately return a request for comment.\n“This is a tragedy and we were there, we were documenting it,” Doss told WISTV 10 . “It was inadvertent. Our hearts go out to the family and all of the people that were involved there. It was a very, very . . . stunning and obviously very tragic moment.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T18:53:35.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
