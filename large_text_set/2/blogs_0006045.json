You need to unpack every word slowly, consider the connotations and use loose definitions of words to get the point. \nTake today's offering from the Knicks president - his first tweet since Dec. 27: Bleacher's Ding almost rings the bell, but I learned you don't change the spot on a leopard with Michael Graham in my CBA daze. â€” Phil Jackson (@PhilJackson11) February 7, 2017 \nOK, let's translate this, phrase by phrase: \nBleacher's Ding \nThat's clearly a reference to Bleacher Report 's Kevin Ding, who had a column today criticizing Carmelo Anthony for not fulfilling the role of a Phil Jackson Superstar (in other words, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant). \nalmost rings the bell, \nIn other words, Jackson says Ding's column was pretty close to the truth. That in itself is a pretty harsh thing to say about your team's highest paid and highest-profile player. Ding's column , in no uncertain terms, says Anthony doesn't care about winning enough. But Jackson left himself some room with that \"almost,\" right? \nbut I learned you don't change the spot on a leopard \nOh, nope. Phil's grievance isn't with the stuff about Anthony but rather the stuff about him. Here's the key sentence in question: \"Jackson undoubtedly overestimated his own ability-perhaps you've heard something lately about the no-trade clause he gifted to Melo in 2014-to kindle Anthony's evolution from superstar to winning superstar.\" \nwith Michael Graham in my CBA \nGraham was Patrick Ewing's co-star on those great 1980s Georgetown teams. He was a very talented power forward who didn't have enough discipline to make the NBA, but he did play for Jackson on the Albany Patroons. And he got dismissed midseason after fighting with Jackson during the game, as this Washingtonian profile of Graham now details . \ndaze. \nThis is hippy for \"days.\" \nSo what does Phil Jackson mean with all of this? He's trying to tell us that he knew he couldn't change Anthony, whom he gave a five-year near-maximum contract with a player option and a no-trade clause. That deal came after Anthony had played for Jackson for a year. \nJackson also set Anthony up with teammates that didn't fit his playing style, and his persistent negativity surely hasn't helped matters. \nBut these days, the goal seems to be getting Anthony to waive his no-trade clause - and ideally to get Kevin Love back in return . So maybe a public shot on Twitter is the right move. At the very least, it's something that happened.
