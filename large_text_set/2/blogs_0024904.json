At the same time, Nielsen’s Live-plus-Same Day ratings give the series an average of 9.56 million viewers per episode. What’s more, neither of those figures take into account viewers watching the show on demand. With its incredible performance taken into account, it’s no surprise that NBC was keen to renew This Is Us for a second and third season before the show’s first season had even finished airing. #ThisIsUs Creator @Dan_Fogelman Breaks Down the Show's Cathartic and Tear-Inducing Farewell https://t.co/NySp4shZs9 pic.twitter.com/xbVINpvH7B \n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 22, 2017 \nIn a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly , the show’s creator Dan Fogelman discussed the future of This Is Us going into its second season. In the interview Fogelman teased Randall’s (Sterling K. Brown) storyline for Season 2, saying “I think you’ll see a lot of that in our next episode, and then really bleeding heavily into next season. He’s clearly a man who’s lived a very structured existence, and he’s a man who’s all things to all people.” \nFogelman also confirmed that Ron Cephas Jones’ character William will remain part of the show, saying “You will see him in the next episode. You will not see him in the finale, but only because it’s a very Jack and Rebecca-centric episode. He’s going to remain a big part of the show.” However, he conceded that he was limited in where he could take William because of his backstory. Don't worry, #ThisIsUs fans, William will be in season 2: https://t.co/38iofeAaO5 pic.twitter.com/Y0CRLc3S2z \n— Entertainment Weekly (@EW) February 22, 2017 \nThis Is Us Episode 17 will air on NBC on March 7 and Episode 18 on March 14. The network looks set to confirm that its newest comedy-drama will return for a second season later this year. \n[Featured Image by NBC]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:22:17.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
