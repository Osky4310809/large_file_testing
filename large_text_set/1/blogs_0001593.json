During a seemingly interminable presentation for the big Faraday Future reveal of its data-point named first production car, the FF 91, the company’s senior vice president of R&D and engineering, Nick Sampson, appeared on stage with the company’s main financier, Jia Yueting. Sampson asked it to park itself. It did not. Here’s The ‘Flagship’ Electric Car That Faraday Future Promised, The FF 91 Here’s The ‘Flagship’ Electric Car That Faraday Future Promised, The FF 91 Here’s The ‘Flagship’ Electric Car That Faraday… Following a disappointing introduction at last year’s CES and a full 12 months of reports of… Read more Read more \nEarlier this evening in the parking lot, the FF 91 executed an impressive-seeming autonomous three point turn and backed into its parking space outside. But inside, onstage, the second attempt was not so lucky. Advertisement Advertisement \nSampson asked Jia to tap a button to engage its “driverless valet” function. Jia went for it, and then... nothing. It didn’t move. \n“It seems like it’s a little lazy tonight,” Sampson said. \nAfter a long speech from Jia, Sampson again attempted to get the car to park itself, saying that it might work if they dimmed the lights. “Let’s let the lights out and see if she’ll become a bit more brave.” Sponsored \nThe stage did dim, and a technician got into the car to do some unseen work before getting out, closing the door and watching the car roll slowly in a straight line before coming to a halt. \nIt probably rolled a good 20 feet before stopping in thee middle of the stage, to much praise by Sampson.

But clearly, it’s not without teething issues yet.
