London theatre is possibly the best in the world and French’s serves it. There is a clear link between the support French’s gives to the theatre industry, and London’s tourist trade. It must be saved, for the good of all.” Supporter: Derek Jacobi said the shop is an 'incredible resource' (Stuart Wilson/Getty ) \nA Samuel French bookshop has existed on various sites around London since 1830 but moved to its present location in 1983. \nManaging Director Douglas Schatz said: “It is with a very heavy heart that we announce the closure of our bookshop in April – we’re extremely sad to see it go and send a huge thank you to all the staff and customers from all over the world who’ve supported the shop through the years. \n“However, we are also very excited about the future of Samuel French, with the growth of our online shop, our innovation in digital play reading, the forthcoming relaunch of our Acting Edition play texts and our expanding catalogue of new authors.” \nHe added that the bookshop was \"very touched\" by the petition's \"huge expression of support\". \nIt calls for the bookshop’s “status as a community asset of cultural importance” to be acknowledged. \nHowever, it wrongly addresses Camden Council as the decision-maker. Councillor Abdul Hai, Cabinet Member for Customers, Communities and Culture at Camden Council, said: “I’m disappointed to hear that the Samuel French bookshop is to close as it has been such a popular cultural resource for people for so many years. \n“But contrary to what has been suggested by the online petition, Camden Council is not the landlord for the building, and as such has no control over the rent rates that are being charged nor the decision to close.” Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T09:52:45.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
