In the case of the vicious war on illegal drugs, President Duterte acknowledged last week that there have been “unintended killings” that have claimed the lives of innocents including children. In fact practically everyone killed in the drug war was legally innocent since guilt beyond reasonable doubt was never established in court, and most of the slain weren’t even indicted. \nFor the unintended killings, the President said he’s sorry, although he made it clear that it would not stop his relentless war. Such a cavalier attitude toward human life is likely to rub off on the forces fighting the drug menace, making them careless about hitting innocents in the crossfire. It can encourage them to continue disregarding laws and rules on armed confrontations and the conduct of arrests and searches. \nThe forces of the Marcos dictatorship at least went through the motions of presenting arrest, search and seizure orders – the dreaded ASSO ­– that were used to crush political dissent. These days, police – and masked vigilantes who may also be lawmen – simply enter neighborhoods and private homes and start shooting, unmindful if toddlers are caught in the crossfire. \nSorry, even from the president of the republic, isn’t enough for those who have lost their children in the course of Oplan Tokhang. The bereaved need justice, which starts with competent investigation and the arrest of the killers. The government must show that the rule of law still prevails in this country and that there is justice for rich and poor alike. \nEvery “unintended killing” must be investigated and the killer brought to justice. Law enforcers cannot just keep saying “oops!” each time they pull the trigger and hit the wrong target. They must be reminded that under most circumstances, they must first aim to disable rather than kill, and not the other way around. \nIn armed police operations, utmost care is required particularly when children are around. Callous disregard for human life can only erode public support for the police in its bloody campaign against the drug menace, especially when cases of “unintended killings” soar and more children become collateral damage.
