Total mortality rates for patients who consumed chili peppers were 21.6% compared to 33.6% for those who didn’t. Capsaicin, the substance that makes chilies hot, may not just be for pepper spray and topical creams — it could be the key to longer life.

It can metabolize fat breakdown and storage for energy in different organs, protecting against plaque buildup, high cholesterol and obesity. This, in turn, can also reduce hypertension and type 2 diabetes, as well as deactivate certain regulators of cellular growth, which could stop tumors. Different types of hot peppers also contain B, C and pro-A vitamins, antioxidants and anti-inflammatory effects. The study only asked participants to note red chili pepper consumption, but doesn't say yellow or green peppers don't have the same benefits.

A 2009 study in India noted the inverse relationship between spice production and cancer compared to the U.S., while a 2015 study done in China noted an inverse relationship between chili pepper consumption and mortality from all causes — including cancer and cardiovascular disease.
