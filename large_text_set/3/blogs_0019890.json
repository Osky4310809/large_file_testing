By Scott Mervis / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nThere was no better place to be in Pittsburgh on Sept. 6, 1957, than the Syria Mosque. \nOn that date, Alan Freed's The Biggest Show Of Stars for 1957 road show rolled through town with Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, the Drifters, Clyde McPhatter, Buddy Holly & the Crickets, Paul Anka, the Everly Brothers and the man who defined rock ‘n’ roll, Chuck Berry. \nMr. Berry, from St. Louis, was, to some, the true King of Rock of Roll, a one-of-a-kind hitmaker who churned out such classics as “Maybellene,”“Johnny B. Goode” and “Roll Over Beethoven,” and all these years later, bands are still copping his scorching guitar licks, sometimes not even knowing it. \n“He was the architect,” says longtime Pittsburgh promoter Rich Engler. “He and Bo Diddley were the two guys who really drove rock ’n’ roll in the early days. \n“Dealing with him,” he adds, “was always very trying.” \nThe music pioneer, who died Saturday at age 90, was rock ’n’ roll royalty, and he had a reputation for acting like it. \nOne of his most memorable nights in Pittsburgh was a famous no-show that led to the Pittsburgh Pirates filing a lawsuit against him. \nMr. Berry was set to perform at Three Rivers Stadium following the Pirates game on Sept. 28, 1986. He was told that he would perform at 5 p.m., but when he arrived a few minutes before 5, the game had gone into extra innings. He insisted that if he was not on stage by 5, he was leaving. The game ended at exactly 5:03 and by then he was gone. \n“It was amazing that he would fly into the city, get a rental car and leave with all those people there,” says Mr. Engler, who promoted it. “You can’t even fathom it.” \nFortunately, the Four Tops, who were to headline, agreed to do a double set. The Pirates went on to sue him for $20,000, and ended up recouping the deposit and some of the damages. \nThe incident wasn’t a shock to Mr. Engler, who had brought him into the Mosque years before that. \n“He showed up for the soundcheck and didn’t like the amp. He said, ‘I wanted a Fender Twin black and this one’s brown. I’ll play on this piece of [junk] but I want an extra $2,000.’ We negotiated it down to $1,000.” \nIn 1982, Mr. Berry was booked to play the Roots of Rock and Roll Show at the Stanley. He was a no-show till intermission of the afternoon set, but then went out and played a great show, despite blowing a fuse in one of his amps. An ancient amp, of course. \nBefore the second show, according to promoter Henry DeLuca, he took a friend from Pittsburgh out to dinner. When he returned, Stanley personnel couldn’t locate the key to his dressing room. \n“So he goes nuts, goes out to his car, he's not going to perform on the second show, he's insulted,” Mr. DeLuca recalled in 2014. “Luckily he had brought his daughter, who was going to do vocals on the show, a beautiful girl, and she persuaded him to come back in.” \nThat night, the oldies crowd got Chuck Berry in vintage form, ending with the whole stage being filled with dancing fans. \nThe last performance he did in Pittsburgh was at the I.C. Light Amphitheater at Station Square on June 6, 1997 with the Marvelettes, the Coasters and the Drifters. \n“I spent a lot of time with him that day,” Mr. Engler recalls. “He was slow to go on, dragging his feet.” \nAnd the performance, it was the irascible Chuck Berry. \n“He never really gave people exactly what they wanted. He tended to play these other things nobody cared about. Kind of like Eric Clapton does a lot. Then he’d play a few things at the end of the show.” \nHe was one of the pioneers of a rebellious music called rock ‘n’ roll, and with Chuck Berry, that rebel attitude was part of the package. \nScott Mervis: smervis@post-gazette.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T02:27:08.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
