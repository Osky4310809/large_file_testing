Despite standing out early on in training camp, Malleck was ultimately waived injured at the end of August after suffering a neck injury during practice. He would go on to receive an injury settlement a few weeks later.\nThe Steelers had shown some interest in the former Hokie themselves when they sent tight ends coach James Daniel to his Pro Day last March, a day in which he apparently performed quite well.\n#Hokies Tweets: Lots of scouts keeping their eyes on TE Ryan Malleck. #ProDay2016 pic.twitter.com/tTrxabVi6c https://t.co/RIFv1dJ70Y \n— Hokies Herald (@hokiesherald) March 16, 2016 \nTE Ryan Malleck running routes. #Hokies pic.twitter.com/rnWkrLmnAs \n— Andy Bitter (@AndyBitterVT) March 16, 2016 \nLike all futures signings, Malleck will have signed a one-year deal worth $465,000. Although he joins a roster with a limited number of tight ends signed to the roster currently, Malleck will face an uphill battle to find a spot among the final 53. A place on the practice squad for 2017 could be a possibility.\nRelated: It appears Le'Veon Bell won't have surgery on injured groin ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:00:27.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
