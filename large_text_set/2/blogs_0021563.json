But they will be happy to know that lump-sum investing has proven to provide better long-term returns. A 2012 Vanguard study found that, on average, lump-sum investments outperformed the installment approach across 12-month rolling historical periods approximately two-thirds of the time. During a 36-month interval, lump-sum investments outperformed over 90 percent of the time. \nThe reason is because stock markets tend to rise over time – the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index , for example, has increased in 28 of the past 37 years. This makes intuitive sense because when markets rise, putting your money to work early promotes higher returns. Since statistics favor lump-sum investing, jumping into the market with both feet can be a good idea — if you can handle the prospect of a market downturn immediately after investing your bonus. \nOf course, every rule has exceptions and it’s not always about the numbers. By investing the total bonus all at once, a person runs the risk of buying at the market’s peak, which can be unsettling for a more emotional and conservative investor. As with nearly all investments, people need to be patient and disciplined to see a significant return. \nDollar-cost averaging: Despite data suggesting dollar-cost averaging may not be as likely to enhance returns in the long run, many investors prefer this strategy as a risk-management technique. Often those who choose dollar-cost averaging are more concerned with downside protection than upside potential. Keep in mind that millions of people make regular contributions to a 401(k) plan or other retirement scheme, which effectively is the same strategy as dollar-cost averaging. \nWhile statistical analysis favors a lump-sum investing approach, dollar-cost averaging has several advantages. For starters, it allows investors to minimize the downside risk of a large, one-time investment and take advantage of the market’s natural volatility. Not only is dollar-cost averaging a good strategy for more risk-averse investors, it also works well during periods of flat stock market performance and bear markets. \nAnd while an investor may sacrifice a little upside, some of my clients prefer the dollar-cost averaging approach because it may prevent significant losses. By maintaining a consistent and disciplined strategy, the average purchase price of stocks often evens out over time due to price fluctuations. \nUltimately, dollar-cost averaging, with its more methodical approach, enables many people to sleep easier by mitigating both risk and stress. \nFor people with a large amount to invest — and especially for professionals in their prime working years — it’s critical to take the long view. One of the most common pitfalls among investors is a knee-jerk response to short term volatility. \nToo often these people turn into day-traders and lose sight of their long-term focus, causing them to sell during market dips. Instead, focus on consistently adding to your portfolio over time, whether in lump sums or smaller systematic increments. Try to remember the common adage that “time in the market is more important than timing the market.” \n— By Ryan Halpern, wealth advisor at Brightworth", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:32:12.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
