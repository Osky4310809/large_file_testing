And it's not that difficult once you've got the hang of the techniques involved. In this video, MTB skills coach Sam from Pedal Progression shows you how it should be done. Step-by-step guide to jumping Jumping is all about exerting pressure and your ability to control the timing of this pressure through each wheel . \nBeing able to generate speed without pedalling, by snapping your arms, legs and feet from bent to straight, is crucial to understanding how a bike gets airborne. The take-off \nFind a jump that you're comfortable with and then roll in at a comfortable speed out of the saddle. \nKeep your weight central, over both wheels, and lower your chest. \nStart to compress and feel the force of the lip against your tyres . Compress into the lip \nTreat each wheel as separate — deal with the front and then the back — not both together. \nSlowly start to transfer your weight from your hands to your feet — the idea is that by the time the front wheel reaches the lip there's no weight pushing through it. Now it's time to transfer your weight from your hands to your feet \nPressing down and then releasing your weight through each wheel when jumping is the same as when you bunnyhop . \nIn this case, the lip of a jump will provide all the lift your wheel will need to follow the trajectory of the jump. \nThis means that jumping is a less explosive movement than a bunnyhop — the idea is to keep your head and core following a smooth arc by using your elbows, knees and ankles to do the pushing. Try and keep your head and core following a smooth arc Weight transfer timings \nThe point at which you transfer your weight from your hands to your feet is very important. \nImagine a line just past halfway up the lip of the jump — this is the point at which you need to change from pushing with your arms to pushing fully from your feet. Make sure you aren't still pushing into the lip once you get to this line \nIf you’re still pushing into the lip through your arms when you get to this line, you’ll end up getting bucked forwards and over the bars. \nAs the jumps get bigger, or your bike’s suspension increases, this line moves further back. The landing \nOnce you're in the air you can relax, the hardest part is done. \nSpot your landing and use your arms and legs to absorb the impact. Use your arms and legs to absorb the impact \nTry to land both wheels at the same time. \nTouching down the rear wheel first can cause the front to wash out and steep front wheel landings can end up with you going over the bars. Try to land the front and rear wheels at the same time \nThen all you need to worry about on landing is staying off the brakes. Jumping tips Start by learning on a tabletop jump, rather than a double, because you’ll have a flat, safe area to land on if you mess up. Don't go too big too soon. If you’re struggling to jump using SPD pedals, try fitting some flats. Play around with your timings too and find what works best for you.
