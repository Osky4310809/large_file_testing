Almost every professional pollster said President Donald Trump would end up losing by historic margins. But there was one professor at American University who got it right.\nAllan Lichtman has correctly predicted every presidential election since 1984. That includes Trump's win. And now, he has a new prediction. He thinks Donald Trump will face impeachment.\nHe's writing a book called, \"The Case for Impeachment.\" In it, he says Trump could get impeached because of his alleged ties to Russia and possible conflicts of interest with his businesses. Lichtman even predicted Trump's impeachment before Election Day. The book is set to be released on April 18th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:46:49.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
