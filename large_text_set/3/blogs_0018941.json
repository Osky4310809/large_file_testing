Umahi \nThe governor urged the church to preach the importance of hardwork to their faithful to enhance their dignity. \nHe said, “There is a programme we want to start in Ebonyi State. By April,we want to start a mentorship programme. We want to start first with civil engineers because I am a civil engineer. We will be calling for three people in each of the 13 local government areas of the state, who are graduates and don’t have anything doing. \n“ We want to start a small recreation course for them. We will bring people from all over the country and also expatriates to train them for one year. \n“They will visit sites and be working on construction sites. After one year, we will deploy them in three companies. We will buy buldoziers, graders and concrete mixers for their companies.” \nUmahi, who pointed out that a true Christian must imbibe the spirit of hardwork and honesty, observed that it was not wise for people to depend on politics as their only source of livelihood. \nHe appealed to the Anglican Communion followers to cue into the agricultural programme of his administration. \nThe governor also said that Afikpo would be given a facelift in line with his administration’s ongoing Urban Renewal Policy, adding that work will commence on Afikpo Uwana road next week.
