Then, with a generous hand, we'd spread the slices with sweet red bean paste, scooped from a can bought at the local Chinese grocery. We’d press the pieces together, then enclose them between the hot metal plates with their triangular indentations.

The first bite released a gush of red bean filling , hot enough to scorch my mouth—but I'd devour it anyway . ♥ + Red Bean Paste (for Mooncakes) by cynthia | two red bowls \nI'm still learning from these early snapshots of my mother, a Taiwanese immigrant, experimenting in an American kitchen. Born and raised in Kaohsiung, she spent thirty years submersed in the colorful sensory palette of the Beautiful Island. \nThen she immigrated to the United States, married a farm boy from Tennessee, and a blank white page opened before her. What did it mean to be American, raise an American family? What place, if any, did Taiwan have in a small Southeastern town? I grew up in a period of discovery, of confusion and loss, and of reconstruction.

Turnip greens and cornbread shared space with fiery mapo tofu; spaghetti sometimes made its way to our mouths on forks, sometimes on chopsticks. Mom's fried eggrolls held legendary status at Sunday church potlucks, an exotic raft amidst a sea of green bean casseroles and ambrosia. We built our own culinary micro-region, consisting of whatever points of connection we found in the food we enjoyed eating together. And there, in that common ground, was adzuki: red bean. Photo by Lori Bailey \nEven my father liked the stuff, so Mom felt no qualms about keeping the sweet paste as a mainstay. But, like so many immigrants, she also wanted to acclimate to her new environment. She, and her children, were going to be Americans. So red bean found its way into our “toasties” (or so some say they're called, though we didn’t bother naming them) and into crescent rolls, the kind in the tubes that explode when you open them. \nAs a kid, I didn't think much about being half-Taiwanese. It was an intrinsic part of daily life, an occasional perk when relatives came from overseas with suitcases full of presents and snacks. Growing up, though, has a way of challenging identity. As ”American” as my mother had tried to raise me, I still found that my pencil paused over the \"Race\" bubble on standardized tests: Asian or Caucasian? Photo by Lori Bailey \nThere was a moon cake incident in high school, when I let some classmates sample the traditional red bean-filled delicacies I'd brought with my lunch. They chewed, cautiously, and delivered their verdict: \"weird,\" \"interesting,\" \"beany,\" \"tastes like bacon.\" I'd so badly wanted them to understand it, to celebrate it—and, transitively, me. \nOnly recently have I finally began to put the pieces together: my mother's background, my experiences growing up, and what it all means today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:40:23.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
