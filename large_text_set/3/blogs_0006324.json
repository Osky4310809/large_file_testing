The 34-year-old goalkeeper has been the main man for the Bhoys for the last two and a half seasons, and will look to be doing so for the next two and a half as well. Hoops No.1 Craig Gordon has committed himself to the club by signing a new three-year deal keeping him at Celtic Park until 2020. pic.twitter.com/KIktVsklSN — Celtic Football Club (@celticfc) March 8, 2017 During the winter transfer window , Asmir Begovic's request to leave Chelsea prompted the Blues to start looking for a new backup to take up his place on the bench. The main name on our list seemed to be Craig Gordon, who was once the most expensive goalkeeper in Premier League history when he signed for Sunderland for £9m before a succession of injuries halted his career in his late 20s. Contract talks between Gordon’s representatives and Celtic were reportedly stalled last month, but the parties were back to the negotiation table shortly after. While the new contract is probably nothing less than Gordon deserves, it is also not necessarily a complete deterrent to Chelsea signing him in the summer — though it does guarantee that Chelsea would need to spend an unnecessary amount of money on a backup player nearing the end of his career.
