Many will remember Moore for her trademark charm, lasting impact, and heaps of moxie, including Dick Van Dyke , who played her husband on The Dick Van Dyke Show .\nThere are no words. \nShe was THE BEST!\nWe always said that we changed each other's lives for the better.\nI… https://t.co/Xm8OBbQQ8j \n— Dick Van Dyke (@iammrvandy) January 26, 2017 \n\nAfter news of Moore’s death broke on Wednesday, Van Dyke released a loving tribute to his screen partner to The Hollywood Reporter , proclaiming that “she left an imprint on television comedy.”\nI got to be on hand and watch her grow into the talent she became. She was just the best. I don’t know what made her comic timing so great. On Dick Van Dyke, we had Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie, both of whom were old hams and had razor-sharp timing, and mine wasn’t bad either. But Mary just picked it up so fast. She had us all laughing after a couple of episodes. She just grabbed onto the character and literally turned us into an improv group, it was so well-oiled. That show was the best five years of my life.\nThe entire tribute is worth a read, and it’s clear that Van Dyke was deeply moved by his work with Moore. She was truly an icon who will be missed. \n(Via The Hollywood Reporter )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T05:34:15.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
