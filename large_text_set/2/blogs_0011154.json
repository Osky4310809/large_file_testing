Yushau, a former Director, Finance and Accounts at the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Headquarters, Abuja, had on Monday told a Federal High Court in Abuja how he always handed US dollar equivalent of N558.2m monthly to Umar. He also gave details of how he assisted Umar to buy five choice houses in Abuja, Kaduna Nad Kano from the money he (Umar) allegedly diverted from the NAF. Yushau, who was cross-examined yesterday by Umar’s lawyer, Hassan Liman (SAN), said there were manual for financial regulations that provided that there must be receipt for every payment by the NAF He explained that all the payment to the COAS was upon his demand being NAF’s chief accounting officer. He added that there the payments were made without any authorising document, and hence, were never receipted. The witness agreed with Liman that the NAF’s Financial Regulations Manual contained a mandatory provision that receipts must be issued for all payments by the NAF. He explained that “in financial matters, payment means that there is a source document where a request for payment for expenditure is made through the Chief Accounting Officer and authority is given for the expenditure. “So, whoever is collecting payment for the expenditure, that payment must be receipted. But, where the Chief Accounting Officer is saying give me this and there is no document, that cannot be said to be payment,” Yishau said. The witness confirmed that he knew of the Financial Regulation of 2007 and revised 2009 “which regulates the financial dealings of ministries, departments and agencies, and other government establishments including the Nigerian Armed Forces.” He added that the military being a unique government institution, said the financial regulation had a limited binding force on the military. “The military is a unique institution and has its own norms, despite the financial regulations. The financial regulation is binding on the armed forces, so long as it does not affect the operational activities of the armed forces,” he said. Yishau said under the military’s financial regulations, he as the Director of Finance and Accounts, was the accounting officer for the NAF, but that the Chief of Air Staff was the chief accounting officer. The witness said by virtue of that, he was only responsible “for ensuring accountability, transparency, stewardship, probity and financial responsibility in all ramifications in the management of the finance of the Nigerian Air Force” through the Chief of Air Staff. In rejecting the suggestion by Liman that it was part of his duty to prepare the budget of the air force, Yushau said: “It is not part of my schedule to prepare and present the budget to the National Assembly. “I only give my input into the budget like other directors of the Nigerian Air Force. The budget office, when I was in the Nigerian Air Force was under the Chief of Policy and Plans and there was a Director of the budget under him. “My input into the budget was in the form of an extent of implementation for the budget year. What I mean by the budget implementation are the details of the money received within the budget year and the programmes that were executed by the NAF. “There were three main signatories to the Nigerian Air Force’s accounts. These were, the Commander Pay and Accounting Group, Ikeja Lagos; the Chief Accountant, usually a senior civilian account staff usually posted from the Accountant-General’s office; and the Air Force’s cashier,” Yushau said. The witness said although he had a supervisory role on the Pay and Accounting Group, the Commander of the group “is responsible to the Chief of Air Staff.” He also said there was a time he was a signatory to “an account designated at the headquarters of the Nigerian Air Force for the construction of NAF Conference Centre. “There was also an account for a reactivation of that was Nigerian Air Force C130 fleet,” he said. Although the lead prosecuting lawyer, Sylvanus Tahir opposed Liman’s move to tender the Manual for Financial Administration for the Armed Forces of Nigeria 2012 signed by the then Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshall Oluseyi Petinrin, the judge overruled him (Tahir) and admitted the document in evidence. Justice Nnamdi Dimgba, in admitting the document, held that it was a was a subsidiary legislation which required no certification. He adjourned to March 28 for Tahir to produce Yishau’s statement sought to be tendered by the defence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:42:22.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
