Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe National Living Wage is to rise to £7.50 an hour from April this year, in line with Chancellor Philip Hammond's Autumn Statement and Spring Budget announcement. \nThe minimum wage for 25-year-olds will rise 4% from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour, in new plans set to go live on 1 April that will leave earners up to £500 better off. \nChancellor Philip Hammond said he hopes to give a big boost to the so-called 'National Living Wage', launched under his predecessor George Osborne's vision, in a bid to get it to £9 by 2020. \nBut, experts say that rate should be more than £2 higher in London at £9.75, or £8.45 across the UK.

There's still a gap between the Government minimum and our real Living Wage of £8.45 in the UK and £9.75 in London, which is based on what families need to earn to meet everyday costs. \nHannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of Money.co.uk said: Increasing the minimum living wage to £7.50 is a helping hand that’ll give full time workers a pay rise of around £600 a year but it’s still not quite enough to afford a decent standard of living. \n\"To really help struggling households £8.50 an hour would be nearer the mark instead. I’d imagine public sector workers are likely to be peeved at this increase as the 4% pay rise dwarfs the 1% cap being forced upon them for the next few years.\" New minimum wage rates from 1 April 2017 *the £3.30 rate apples to apprentices under 19 or in their first year Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T15:49:45.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
