That means that when you complain to your boss because your co-worker mis-gendered you, he’s probably not going to bend over backwards to bandage your wounds. Given feelings are entirely subjective in nature, it’s completely unreasonable to demand everyone tip-toe around you to prevent yours from being hurt. The reality is that people will offend you and hurt your feelings, and they won’t stop to mop up your tears because they shouldn’t have to. Learning to accept criticism, alternative viewpoints, and even outright insults will make you happier in the long run than routinely playing the victim card.\nYou DO Have The Right To Live As You Please — But Not To Demand People Accept It\nBy contrast, you do have the right to live however you please, so long as it’s within the confines of the law . If you want to cross-dress, smoke marijuana, drink lots of alcohol, have lots of sex, and, yes, even go to school for gender studies, then by all means, go for it. Government should not be allowed to legislate people’s behavior as long as it doesn’t infringe upon someone else’s rights, but that doesn’t mean society isn’t allowed to have an opinion. You don’t have the right to demand people keep their opinions about your lifestyle to themselves, especially if you’re open and public about it. I have as much of a right to comment on the way you live your life as you do to actually live it. Your feelings are not a protected right, but my speech is.\nThe Only Safe Space Is Your Home\nNo matter where you go in life, someone will be there to offend you. Maybe it’s a joke you overheard on vacation, a spat at the office, or a difference of opinion with someone in line at the grocery store. Inevitably, someone will offend you and your values. If you cannot handle that without losing control of your emotions and reverting back to your “safe space” away from the harmful words of others, then you’re best to just stay put at home. Remember, though: if people in the outside world scare you, people on the internet will downright terrify you. It’s probably best to just accept these harsh realities of life and go out into the world prepared to confront them wherever they may be waiting.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/60VP0wHsZDY", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/zerohedge/feed", "http://www.cafepress.com/zerohedge", "http://zerohedge-newsletter.iclnd.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JuhQAi4Y9JU", "https://www.theburningplatform.com/2017/02/24/nigel-farage-is-woke/", "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Woman-yelling-in-megaphone-1024x682.jpg", "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20151114_crybully-1024x746.jpg", "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/111315-RickMcKee2-1024x678.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-25T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:40:10.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
