However, unlike the way the movie versions of Starsky & Hutch and 21 Jump Street played up those shows’ alleged homoeroticism for ironic, lighthearted laughs, CHIPS lets it be known from the jump that it isn’t down with that gay shit. \nWhen Michael Peña’s Frank “Ponch” Poncherello and Dax Shepard’s Jon Baker first meet, Ponch immediately gets standoffish as Baker tries to hug him while wearing nothing but boxer briefs. When Baker accuses Ponch of being homophobic, we get a rambling, not-that-funny debate between them about what homophobia actually is. They bicker for the first half of the film, of course, but eventually bond when Ponch accidentally faceplants into Baker’s naked crotch while trying to carry Baker over to a bathtub (you just have to roll with the setups). Twitter folk have been griping about these moments of gay panic from the movie’s trailers, but considering how this flick is such a jacked, testosterone-heavy frenzy of car chases, explosions, violence, hot women and wall-to-wall dick jokes, I’m actually kind of shocked there aren’t more homophobic gags here. (It is worth noting that there are gay male characters in the movie, but they seem to be there only to die horribly or get injured a lot.)
