There was some ‘miscommunication’ about Kelly’s role with personnel when he was with the Eagles, but he and Baalke have seemingly been on the same page.\nThe 49ers close out their regular season on Sunday at home against the Seattle Seahawks.\nOne of the possible replacements for the position is to promote Assistant GM Tom Gamble. Gamble at least should be able to move forward positively with Kelly, rather than an outside candidate being forced to work with a coach they didn’t have a hand in hiring — although not entirely impossible.\nThere was trouble brewing ahead of the season when quarterback Colin Kaepernick demanded a trade, before being benched for five weeks due to “arm fatigue” when he was forced to stay in San Francisco. Eventually, Baalke renegotiated his contract, removing his 2017 injury guarantee, but allowing for a postseason opt-out option — one the quarterback was reported to have expressed utilizing.\nFormer Niners head coach Mike Nolan spoke out in early December in Baalke’s defense , noting that some of the personnel turnover the past few seasons has been atypical, and that Baalke’s coaching choices might be the ultimate reason for his firing.\n“I think they have the right guy in place to pick the players. But unfortunately for Trent, I think the choice of Tomsula hurt him, and currently right now you know, with Chip Kelly, it’s not helping him either. All of a sudden you say, “Look, we can’t keep him, he’s the one that picked the last two guys,” I guess is maybe what they’re saying.”\nBaalke has been with the Niners organization since 2005 when he was the Western region scout. He followed that up with positions as Director of Player Personnel, Vice President of Player Personnel and earned the promotion to General Manager in 2011.\nHis career as an executive also took him to the New York Jets and Washington as a national scout before heading to San Francisco.
