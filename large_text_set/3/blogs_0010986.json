According to the Washington Post , Russian intelligence members hired two hackers to help them with the Yahoo! dirty work.\nOn Wednesday, if all goes as reported, the Department of Justice (DOJ) will announce charges against Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin — who happen to have worked in cyber investigations for Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) — and the two hackers.\nSEE ALSO: Russian hackers reportedly blackmailing liberal groups because no one learned a damn thing\nThe hackers are Alexsey Belan — one of two hackers hit by U.S. sanctions following Russia's interference in the U.S. election, alongside real-life bond villain Evgeniy Bogachev — and Karim Baratov. According to the Post , the charges include, \"hacking, wire fraud, trade secret theft and economic espionage.\"\nYahoo didn't disclose the 2014 hack until September 2016 , which resulted in an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigation put Yahoo!'s proposed sale to Verizon in jeopardy, and cost CEO Marrissa Mayer a lot of coin (and her job ).\nOfficials are still investigating if the four suspects are connected to that other massive Yahoo! data breach in 2013.\nAccording to the Post , Wednesday's charges are not connected to either the 2016 Democratic National Committee hack or the ongoing investigation in to Russia's alleged interference of the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections.", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-charging-russian-spies-and-criminal-hackers-for-yahoo-intrusion/2017/03/15/64b98e32-0911-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_justice-1010a:homepage/story&utm_term=.8a571de40725", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/business/dealbook/yahoo-would-become-altaba-after-selling-its-internet-business.html"], "published": "2017-03-15T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T17:47:38.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
