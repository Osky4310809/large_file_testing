Craig Burley and Mark Donaldson discuss whether Thierry Henry could succeed Arsene Wenger at Arsenal. Paul Scholes has explains Arsene Wenger has earned the right to do as he'd like at Arsenal due to the success he's brought. Craig Burley suggests Arsene Wenger's uncertain future is affecting potential replacements and others around football. The FC panel yet again debate Arsene Wenger's impact at Arsenal, and if his vision should still be trusted at the club. \nMesut Ozil has told Sport Bild that he has \"never experienced anything like\" the support he receives at Arsenal and cited a chant about him being \"better than Zidane\" as an example of his relationship with the club. \nOzil's contract at Arsenal expires in 2018 and he is yet to commit to a longer deal leading to speculation about his future, but comments about his pride at the fans' love for him hint at a favourable resolution. \n\"You know what made me proud? That day, the Arsenal fans texted the Ozil song,\" Ozil said of the first time he heard the chant. \"I've never experienced anything like it at any other club. It gives me goose bumps every time the fans sing that song.\" \nDuring the 2015-16 season when Ozil set up 19 Premier League goals, just one short of the record, set by Thierry Henry in 2002-03, Arsenal fans adapted West Ham's song about Dimitri Payet set to the tune of Billy Ray Cyrus' Achy Breaky Heart, and sang: \"We've got Ozil, Mesut Ozil, I just don't think you understand. He's Arsene Wenger's man, he's better than Zidane.\" Mesut Ozil has assisted eight goals in all competitions for Arsenal this season. \nOzil is often singled out for criticism due to perceptions about his body language and attitude on the pitch but the Germany international said that was \"extreme\" and highlighted his accomplishments. \n\"People know what I have achieved. That I am a World Cup winner, played for Real Madrid, set up 20 goals last season [in all competitions]. When the team's on a bad run, somebody needs to be singled out, sadly most of the time it's me,\" Ozil said, adding that he's become tougher over the years. \nWhen Real Madrid take on German champions Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinals Ozil said his allegiance will come down on the side of Los Blancos . \n\"Of course my heart beats for Real,\" he said. \"I played there and still have many friends to this day in the team and in the club. Therefore I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Real, even against Bayern\" \nMeanwhile, Germany head coach Joachim Low told Sport Bild that Ozil was \"one of the best players in the No. 10 position in the world.\" \n\"His passes, his touch of the ball are unique,\" Low said. \"He plays his passes directly into the running path of his teammates, exactly where they have to go. That's Mesut's big strength, and Cristiano Ronaldo profited from it at Real. \n\"Sure, his performances are patchy sometimes. But he does things, which not everyone sees at first glance. Even when he is not at his best, he usually has the best running performances at the highest intensity. He covers a lot of ground, and a few don't realise it. \n\"Mesut can make the difference.\" \nStephan Uersfeld is the Germany correspondent for ESPN FC.
