I live off of pepperoni pizza, so this is a natural fit for us to reunite once again on the track.” \nJRM has been partnered with the pizza brand since 2014 and is a familiar partner for Sadler, who won with the brand at Chicagoland Speedway in 2012. \nIt was also announced that Kevin Meendering will return to Sadler’s pit box for the 2017 season. \nMeendering and Sadler combined for three wins in 2016 but the crew chief was suspended by NASCAR for the season finale at Homestead after two loose lug nuts were found at Phoenix the previous week.
