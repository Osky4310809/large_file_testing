This move ensures a team would have to give Pats a 1st rounder to sign Butler.\n— Jeff Howe (@jeffphowe) March 7, 2017 \n\nButler’s first-round tender is worth $3.91 million. If Butler becomes a restricted free agent, any team who would potentially sign him to an offer sheet would now have to send the Patriots a first-round pick as compensation if they declined to match the offer.\nThe news is significant for the Patriots and Butler – not necessarily because of the first-round compensation, but because the two sides still do not appear close to reaching an agreement on a long-term contract extension. Butler is now likely to hit restricted free agency on Thursday and become a candidate for an offer sheet.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:54:53.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
