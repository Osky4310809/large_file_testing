I can’t really overcome this feeling that this is not someone I want in office,” said Drexel University student Stephanie Oppenheim. \nOppenheim came to Temple’s campus to join other students who are upset that Trump is now the most powerful person in the world. Friday’s rain didn’t bother some. \n“I think that it adds to the ambiance, for sure, and I think that the fact we are here means we are serious about it,” said Temple student Oliva Rehbinder. \nFrom there, the group marched south on Broad Street before joining with another group at Community College of Philadelphia, and then marching to City Hall where multiple groups came together at the Frank Rizzo statue. Nearly 200 protesters took part in the demonstrations.

We definitely want them in the conversation too though,” Rodriquez said. “We don’t want to shut them out.” \nTemple student Nadia echoed those thoughts.

Just like they were very dissatisfied those last 8-years, here were are. These four years we’re going to let our anxieties known, let our concerns be known.” \nMany of the protest groups say they plan to continue demonstrations for the foreseeable future. \nPolice are not reporting any major issues, but want people to be aware things might be delayed getting in and out of Center City during rush hour.
