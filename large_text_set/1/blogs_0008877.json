He was rushed to hospital by an ambulance, but was certified dead upon arrival. Upon reviewing security footage, police said Breant was focused on looking at his phone whilst taking the escalator, and is believed to have fallen by accident, Oriental Daily reports . \nPolice officers said they seized a resignation letter written in Chinese at the scene. Breant, a longtime Hong Kong resident and HKID holder, was the chef at Alchemy, a restaurant on Arbuthnot Road specialising in \"dark dining\", where customers eat in complete darkness in an attempt to enhance their other senses. \nOliver Caisson, the co-founder of Alchemy's parent group, French Creations, told Time Out Hong Kong Breant's colleagues were \"shocked and saddened\" by the news, calling his death an \"unfortunate accident\" after he \"fell badly on an escalator\". \nGot a tip?
