By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 27, 2017 12:21 PM MCD Elections 2017 will take place on April 23. \nThe upcoming MCD elections in Delhi are seen as a semi-final for Arvind Kejriwal -led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) before the next assembly elections. Confident over its recent victories in civic body polls across India, Bharatiya Janata Party is hoping to retain the MCD for the third consecutive term. For this, the party has even denied tickets to all sitting councillors and their family members. However, it is not going to win it easy this time. It is not just the AAP and Congress , gearing up to halt the saffron march, there are some new contenders in the fray also — Janata Dal (U) and Swaraj India. All parties have made several big promises to the Delhiites. A few weeks ago, Kejriwal had even said Delhi will become like London if AAP wins the MCD elections. Kejriwal’s announcement, however, invited a lot of criticism from the opposition camps. \nElections to 272 wards of north, east and south municipal corporations will be held on April 23 and the results will come out on April 25. While NDMC and SMDC have 104 seats each, EDMC has 64 seats. Here we take a look at what all parties are promising to the voters: \nAAP \nKejriwal has said house tax will be abolished and pending dues will be waived if Aam Aadmi Party emerges victorious in the municipal elections. \nWithin a year of coming to power in the MCDs, the AAP administration would turn around the finances of the loss-making municipal bodies and ensure that their employees get their salaries on or before the seventh of every month. महिलाओं की सुरक्षा के लिए अरविन्द केजरीवाल ने तो तीन पेज भर के वादे किये थे लेकिन तीन लाइन भी पूरा नहीं किया: श्री @AmitShah pic.twitter.com/bbSbj63v1A \n— BJP (@BJP4India) March 26, 2017 \nBJP \nBJP has promised to free of the “corruption” by AAP. “No other party has done as much corruption as AAP did during their tenure in Delhi. Not one of two but 13 legislators of the AAP have been booked for criminal cases ever since AAP won elections in Delhi,” Shah said on Sunday. \nCongress \nIn its roadmap for Delhi, Congress has promised to make it the “cleanest and most beautiful” city in the world. “If the party wins the civic polls, it will make the municipal corporations self-reliant in two years and develop Delhi as the cleanest and most beautiful city in the world, Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken said on Sunday. \nCongress will also ensure the payment of dues, including Rs 1,563 crore arrear to sanitation workers, and regularisation of temporary staff. \nJD(U) \nNitish Kumar-led JD(U) is promising to legalise all unauthorised colonies, address issues like unemployment, power supply, water supply, drainage. The party is also seeking votes in the name of liquor ban in Bihar. \nSwaraj India \nYogendra Yadav -led Swaraj India has promised to solve environment related issues in Delhi. The party has promised three different election manifestoes for the municipal corporations of Delhi. Other promises by the party, which is yet to receive it poll symbol, include, re-categorisation of colonies, recovery of tax dues including from Delhi Development Authority, adopting a citizen’s charter that will outline a timeframe for delivery of key services, online facilities etc. \nAll parties are yet to release their formal election manifestos.
