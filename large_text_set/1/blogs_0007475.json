(Emily Schwartz photo) Privacy Policy \nThe old '60s saw, \"Never trust anyone over 30,\" worked off the assumption that people (and perhaps by extension, institutions) grow more conservative as they age. But in the case of Pegasus Theatre Chicago's Young Playwrights Festival, which hits the three-decade mark this year, that's a huge false assumption. Every year, the festival provides a chance for young people to write about what they want, not necessarily what adults think they should be writing about. \nThrough several iterations of the festival, it's always been refreshing to see the teen writers flout the safe \"write what you know\" bromide. This year's quartet of one-acts includes stories of an obsessed barista, an overprotective dragon, a shadowy Illuminati-esque cabal practicing the dark arts and an afterlife game show. \nIlesa Duncan, Pegasus' producing artistic director, notes that while the plays are all different in subject matter and style, \"They all felt like they were based on some assumption of what is happening (in the play) and how that changes.\" \nThe program begins with a yearlong series of writing workshops and playwright residencies in local high schools. Duncan notes that Pegasus does not provide thematic prompts for the students. \"We are looking for voice, creativity — we want our representation of student writing to be from an authentic perspective,\" she says. The plays are submitted each spring to a panel of theater professionals, and each playwright — whether he or she makes the final cut or not — receives a critique on his or her writing. \nA new element this year was an intensive revision workshop, led by Chicago Dramatists resident playwright Dana Lynn Formby, in which the finalists got feedback, then had a week to rewrite. Ricardo Salgado, a senior at Lane Tech College Prep whose comedy \"Eye See All\" (directed by Warner Crocker) follows a conspiracy theorist as she and her brother infiltrate California's Bohemian Grove retreat for power brokers, found the revision process exhilarating. \"As soon as I submitted (the script), as soon as I hit the button, I thought, 'I want to rewrite everything.'\" \nDuncan directed two of the pieces — Elyssa Saldana's medieval fantasy \"Guarding the Princess,\" in which a fearsome dragon with a crush on his charge learns to let go, and Sejahari Saulter-Villegas' \"Race to the Finish,\" in which Laquan McDonald and Rekia Boyd, who were both shot to death by Chicago police officers, try to rewrite their history through game-show challenges. \nSays Duncan, \"They are completely different plays, but they are both dealing with the fantastical in some ways. One is a fantasy and one is a satire, but they are still dealing with real-world issues. The assumption in the case of 'Guarding the Princess' is that a dragon can't be loved by a human. She's exploring friendship and communication and the power dynamics behind being accepted.\" Saldana wrote the play while at Whitney Young Magnet High School, but she is now in her first year studying creative writing at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. \nSaulter-Villegas, a senior at Kenwood Academy who received an honorable mention citation in last year's festival, says he wanted to \"take reality and put it in a fictional world. I knew I wanted to do a play on police brutality and I knew I wanted to do it in a very creative way. Once I knew what I wanted to talk about, it was a matter of really enhancing the creativity.\" His script includes sardonic \"commercials\" featuring Donald Trump pitching \"Whiteness\" as a cure-all, and Rachel Dolezal (the white former civil rights worker who \"passed\" as black) touting black-power accessories. \nSaulter-Villegas also writes slam poetry, and Alexandra Obert of Lincoln Park High School (author of \"Obsessed,\" in which a young male employee of a coffeehouse develops a crush on a customer and begins tracking her online and offline) described herself in an introductory video as \"more of a poet than a playwright.\" Saulter-Villegas also cites the late August Wilson as an inspiration, while Saldana says, \"I got a lot of my influences from reading comic book layouts. It's a bit similar to the script structure.\" \nShe also notes that one of the things she learned in Formby's revision workshop is that \"when it comes to plays, you really have to have objects in your play to help the audience see something that helps them relate to certain emotions or feelings.\" She was also pleasantly surprised that her dragon, Edward, which she originally envisioned as a puppet, was played by Quenna Lene Barrett in Amy Chmeilewski's cunning costume. (All the plays draw from the collective ensemble of four men and three women.) \nThe fact that the plays are directed, designed and performed by working professionals adds a sense of accomplishment for the young writers. Saulter-Villegas says, \"I was super excited to go to the dress rehearsal and see it. It was surreal for me. Just knowing that you created this and professionals took on your work.\" \nAs Salgado, whose \"Eye See All\" is his first play, puts it, \"This is the mother of all confidence boosters. It's something that you wrote that someone else said, 'This is worth something. Let's put our time and effort into it.'\" \nKerry Reid is a freelance critic. \nYoung Playwrights Festival \nWhere: Chicago Dramatists, 773 N.
