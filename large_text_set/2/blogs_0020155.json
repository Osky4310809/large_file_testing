The city’s contribution to the fund is based on the value of the city’s assessable property. The latest estimate means roughly $12 million in city dollars going to the fund. Private donors can also contribute. \nCity Council President Bernard C. “Jack” Young says the youth fund will have a “major impact.” Representatives from organizations like Catholic Charities and Associated Black Charities will serve on the task force that will determine where the money goes. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
