By Wesley Yin-Poole   \nNarita Boy's trailer is one of the coolest I've seen for a video game in quite a while. \nThe 80s-themed 2D side-scroller features handcrafted pixel sprites, some wonderful animation work and an analog synthesizer-fuelled soundtrack. \nThe video, below, came out last week and quickly caught the eye. Now, its Spanish developer, Studio Koba, has launched a Kickstarter asking for â‚¬120,000 to build the game. \nNarita Boy is the brainchild of Eduardo Fornieles, a designer who worked as a concept artist for Vane, the upcoming game from Tokyo's Friend & Foe studio. Fornieles decided to create his own company in 2016 to try to make Narita Boy a reality. \n\"For the 80s lovers, just imagine a mix of Ready Player One, Another World and He-Man to have a glance of what Narita Boy could be,\" Fornieles said. \nDefinitely one to watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:49:10.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
