A second source in the intelligence community confirms the intelligence about the Russian conversations and notes it has been gathered since the inauguration. \nSnowden’s lawyer says they are not aware of any proposals that would send Snowden back to the United States, and as of now, “has no reason for concern.” \nNBC News spoke to a former deputy national security adviser who offered up a warning to Trump not to immediately accept this gesture from Vladimir Putin, as it would be a “win-win” for Putin since it’s likely the Russian government has already obtained any information they wanted from Snowden by now. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:13:13.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
