He’s running laps. He’s jogging now. I mean, he was crippled yesterday. He’d been through many operations and stuff, [but now has been] just instantly healed, he was jumping up and down today, just shouting.” \nYou won’t be surprised to learn that there’s no evidence of these miracles. No medical records. No proof that the man was truly crippled for years until he was miraculously healed. No proof that people were resurrected. No names. No video. No pictures. No Facebook Live. \nThat last one’s especially ironic since Joyner told this story over the weekend using that exact service … so he clearly knows how it works. And he knows how to use the video function on his phone. But I guess he forgot how to use them when all these supposed miracles were occurring. \nIt’s strange, isn’t it, that these pastors never have video evidence that could convert skeptics into believers… but they always have video describing the events after the fact?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T15:29:51.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
