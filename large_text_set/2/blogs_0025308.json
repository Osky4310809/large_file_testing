Voices I was a huge Jeremy Corbyn supporter but now I just want him to resign \nWhen he stood for leadership, I found him refreshing, principled and honest. But I've come to realise that Corbyn's honesty isn't going to win him any elections – voters simply don't care about it Tuesday 28 February 2017 11:22 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online The Labour leader will not be addressing his colleagues at the PLP meeting on Monday Getty \nWhen Jeremy Corbyn snuck onto the Labour leadership ballot paper at the last minute in the summer of 2015, I had some renewed hope for the future of the party. After that surprisingly awful election defeat, it looked as though Labour was set to lurch to its right, especially when acting leader Harriet Harman whipped her MPs to abstain from voting on the government’s welfare bill. \nCorbyn suddenly appeared as a solution: a potential party leader with an anti-austerity message that was far more inspiring than anything offered by Ed Miliband. \nHe stood out from a lacklustre field of candidates with his unpolished style and principled policies. At the time he announced he was running he was seen as a massive outsider, both in terms of winning and his political position. The term “veteran left-winger” hadn’t been used that frequently since Ryan Giggs retired from football. \nCorbyn appeared to be a change from politics as usual, but unfortunately, it all unravelled less than a year after his election. \nCorbyn’s time as leader has overwhelmingly proven him to be more incompetent than refreshing – and I say that as someone who wholeheartedly backed him from the start. Now I have to admit that the warning signs were there from early on, particularly when he began to blame the media for most of his struggles. The most ridiculous claims made about Jeremy Corbyn The most ridiculous claims made about Jeremy Corbyn 1/11 He called Hezbollah and Hamas ‘friends’ \nTrue. In a speech made to the Stop the War Coalition in 2009, Mr Corbyn called representatives from both groups “friends” after inviting them to Parliament. He later told Channel 4 he wanted both groups, who have factions designated as international terror organisations, to be “part of the debate” for the Middle East peace process. “I use (the word ‘friends’) in a collective way, saying our friends are prepared to talk,” he added. “Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do? No.” Reuters 2/11 ‘Jeremy Corbyn thinks the death of Osama bin Laden was a tragedy’ \nPartly false. David Cameron used this as a line of attack at the Conservative Party conference but appears to have left out all context from Mr Corbyn’s original remarks. In an 2011 interview on Iranian television, the then-backbencher said the fact the al-Qaeda leader was not put on trial was the tragedy, continuing: “The World Trade Center was a tragedy, the attack on Afghanistan was a tragedy, the war in Iraq was a tragedy.” 3/11 He is ‘haunted’ by the legacy of his ‘evil’ great-great-grandfather \nFalse. A Daily Express exposé revealed that the Labour leader’s ancestor, James Sargent, was the “despotic” master of a Victorian workhouse. Addressing the report at the Labour conference, Mr Corbyn said he had never heard of him before, adding: “I want to take this opportunity to apologise for not doing the decent thing and going back in time and having a chat with him about his appalling behaviour.” 4/11 Jeremy Corbyn raised a motion about ‘pigeon bombs’ in Parliament \nThis one is true. On 21 May 2004, Mr Corbyn raised an early day motion entitled “pigeon bombs”, proposing that the House register being “appalled but barely surprised” that MI5 reportedly proposed to load pigeons with explosives as a weapon. The motion continued: “The House… believes that humans represent the most obscene, perverted, cruel, uncivilised and lethal species ever to inhabit the planet and looks forward to the day when the inevitable asteroid slams into the earth and wipes them out thus giving nature the opportunity to start again.” It was not carried. 5/11 He rides a Communist bicycle \nFalse. A report in The Times referred to Mr Corbyn, known for his cycling, riding a “Chairman Mao-style bicycle” earlier this year. “Less thorough journalists might have referred to it as just a bicycle, but no, so we have to conclude that whenever we see somebody on a bicycle from now on, there goes another supporter of Chairman Mao,” he later joked. 6/11 'Jeremy Corbyn will appoint a special minister for Jews' \nFalse so far. The Sun report in December was allegedly based on a “rumour” passed to the paper by a Daily Express columnist who has written pieces critical of the Labour leader in the past. The minister did not materialise in his shadow cabinet. 7/11 ‘Jeremy Corbyn wishes Britain would abolish its Army’ \nFalse. Another gem from The Sun took comments made at a Hiroshima remembrance parade in August 2012 where Mr Corbyn supported Costa Rica’s move to abolish it armed forces. “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if every politician around the world…abolished the army and took pride in the fact that they don’t have an army,” he added. The caveat that “every politician” must take the step suggests Mr Corbyn does not support UK disarmament just yet. 8/11 Jeremy Corbyn stole sandwiches meant for veterans \nFalse. The Guido Fawkes blog claimed that the Labour leader took sandwiches meant for veterans at at Battle of Britain memorial service in September but a photo later emerged showing him being handed one by Costa volunteers, who later confirmed they were given to all guests. 9/11 He missed the induction into the Queen’s privy council \nTrue. After much speculation about Mr Corbyn’s republican views and willingness to bow to the monarch, his office confirmed that he did not attend the official induction to the privy council because of a prior engagement, but did not rule out joining the body. 10/11 Jeremy Corbyn refuses to sing the national anthem. \nPartly true. The Labour leader was filmed standing in silence as God Save the Queen was sung at a Battle of Britain remembrance service but will reportedly sing it in future. Mr Corbyn was elusive on the issue in an interview, saying he would show memorials “respect in the proper way”, but sources said he would sing the anthem at future occasions. 11/11 He is a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Cheese \nTrue. The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.” \nThat blame game has continued among his remaining supporters, many of whom clearly place loyalty to their man ahead of acknowledging his lack of electability. It simply isn’t good enough to use unfavourable coverage as an excuse. The purpose of the media is to thoroughly scrutinise politicians, especially party leaders, who have to be prepared to deal with it. \nI accepted that Corbyn would never win a general election once the polling worsened for Labour after the Brexit vote. Since then it has been consistently horrendous, with some polls showing Labour up to 17 points behind the Conservatives. That is against a Conservative Party in government during the most turbulent time in recent political history, with a continued budget deficit and a national debt above 90 per cent of GDP. \nThe polling has translated into electoral failure too, and an opposition party losing a seat to the Government in a by-election for the first time in 35 years should be enough on its own to force the leader to resign. \nDavid Miliband said on Saturday that Labour is further from power than at any time in the last 50 years, and I think he’s absolutely right. As admirable as it is to have strongly held principles, they are completely pointless if you are incapable of winning a general election and putting them into practice. \nIn Corbyn’s defence, one of his most attractive principles is his honesty. But the trouble is that it’s become increasingly clear that isn’t what people actually want from their politicians. While honesty is an important part of any political arsenal, it is dwarfed by the most crucial quality that a leader must have: charisma. \nThis became obvious during recent attempts to relaunch Corbyn as a left-wing populist, which completely flopped. To succeed as a political outsider, you have to be an enthusiastic public speaker to convince the electorate that your policies are worth voting for. The power of charisma as a political weapon has been proven by Donald Trump, whose public speaking ability is the closest thing he has to a redeeming quality. The US President’s unique way of talking was so effective that he was able to tell easily disprovable lies and still see his polling numbers rise. Corbyn’s unique way of talking only manages to make him sound as though even he is bored of his ideas. Flustered Corbyn adamant he will still be leader in 2020 \nI completely understand why many of Corbyn’s supporters get so angry when his shortcomings are pointed out. They feel this is the only opportunity they will get to have a leader who agrees with them, and that if Corbyn quits then the left will fade into obscurity. \nHowever, they need to face up to the reality that, barring a truly spectacular turnaround, Labour is set for a crushing general election defeat in 2020, for which the left of the party will be blamed. There’s no need to completely abandon left-wing policies, but they must bring in a more effective figurehead – someone, perhaps, like Clive Lewis. \nThe party now faces a difficult reality. If a leadership contest happened tomorrow, any candidate seen as centrist by the party’s membership would be defeated by Corbyn, who will surely only step aside for an equally left-wing candidate. But equally, a left-wing candidate would struggle to even accrue the nominations needed to get on the ballot paper after taking the risk with Corbyn so spectacularly backfired. \nThere will have to be a compromise, with both the pro and anti-Corbyn sides of the party unifying behind a candidate that neither of them is completely happy with, for the sake of having any chance of winning the general election in 2020. Labour has a simple choice to make: replace Corbyn with a more charismatic leader, or face electoral oblivion and political exile. And it’s the responsibility of all factions of the party to help make that happen.
