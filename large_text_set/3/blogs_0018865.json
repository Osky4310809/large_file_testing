The company says they may contain a defective part and have been distributed worldwide.\nBatches 5FA665, 5FA6651, 5FA6652, 5FA6653 are included in the recall.\nThere have been two reports confirming the device failed to activate.\n“The failure of the auto-injector to activate may result in patients not receiving the required dose of adrenaline resulting in the worsening of symptoms of anaphylaxis or anaphylactic reactions, which could be life threatening,” the company says.\nConsumers who have a recalled EpiPen batch number should replace it with a new one as soon as possible by returning it to their pharmacist. Recapped EpiPens will be replaced free of charge.\nOfficials advise consumers to keep affected auto-injectors until they are replaced and use it if required.\nOfficials say at this time, EpiPen® Jr 150µg Adrenaline Injection Syringe Auto-Injectors and all other batches of EpiPen® 300µg Adrenaline Injection Syringe Auto-Injectors are unaffected and are not subject to the recall.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:19:29.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
