Every month, the major streaming services get a handful of new shows and documentaries about chefs, restaurants, and the ways people eat around the world. Here’s a look at what’s new to stream in March: Samurai Gourmet (Netflix, available March 17) Fans of Japanese manga will want to tune into Samurai Gourmet . Adapted from actor Masayumi Kasuki’s essay and comic of the same name, this 12-episode series follows a newly retired Kasuki as he “discovers the joys of daytime drinking and the realization that he is now free to eat and drink what he wants, when he wants.” Who can’t relate to that? This gluttonous awakening allows Kasuki to delve into the world of fantasy and reimagine himself as a samurai warrior in the time of Japan’s civil wars.
