Key points Cheap appliances use more power Energy efficiency education needed in remote communities Prepaid electricity billing needed in remote communities to avoid bill shock Solar hot water recommended to keep energy costs down \nThe study found improving energy efficiency and energy education in remote Aboriginal communities was the key to lower electricity bills. \nIn Ms Sullivan's case, her bills were upwards of $500 every quarter. \n\"I can't afford to buy anything because if I don't pay the power, I will have no power,\" she said. \n\"I will go without a lot, and so does everybody. A lot of other people around the town too.\" \nMs Sullivan said she had noticed the difference after the meters were installed, with savings of about $200 on her latest bill. \nShe said the research project helped identify appliances that were using more electricity than she had thought. \n\"It helped me a great deal because one big electric heater was just chewing the power,\" she said. \n\"And if I had known that from the start, I might not have used it from the start.\" Recommendations highlight education as key \nThe study by the University of New South Wales joined forces with the Dharriwa Elders Group on a research project that involved Walgett residents. \nThe aim of the research was to find ways of reducing the cost of energy to lessen the financial burdens on households in remote communities.

Prepaid electricity option needed \nOne of the suggested changes looked at the option of pre-paying for electricity usage for people who struggled to pay their bills. \nThis method was used by many Aboriginal communities around Australia, but not in New South Wales. \nHowever, Mr Alexander said it would be hard to convince energy retailers to adopt this payment method because the state had never introduced it. \n\"This would be really beneficial for these communities because it avoids bill shock,\" he said. \n\"It allows them to budget their electricity bills better, it allows them to share costs with friends and family, which a lot of people expressed a desire to do, and it allows them to control when they get disconnected.\" High energy tariffs an issue \nThe study found some rural and remote areas were paying energy tariffs that were almost double that of their urban counterparts. Buying a new fridge, turning off the microwave during the day, and putting clothes through a cold wash are just a few changes to cut energy bills. \n\"We did some measurements of the houses of the participants in the project,\" Mr Alexander said. \n\"They used on average, despite only being about 2.5 people per house, more than the average five-person house in New South Wales.\" \nHe said some participants did not realise buying cheap appliances would also drive up their bills. \nThe researcher said more education around purchasing energy efficient appliances, and how to use them without driving up costs, would benefit remote communities. \nOther recommendations included adopting solar panels, improving social housing properties in remote communities, having the option of switching electricity retailers, and improving home insulation. \nMs Sullivan said the Dharriwa Elders Group hoped the research would lead to improvements in energy efficiency and policy for Aboriginal communities across Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:46:51.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
