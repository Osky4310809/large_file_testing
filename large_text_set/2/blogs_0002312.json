But there are reasons for concern, especially when you look more closely at user growth in Europe and the rest of the world \nWith the release of the company’s S-1 filing today, Snap revealed that at the end of 2016 the company had 158 million daily active users who spend 25-30 minutes a day in its app on average. \nIts daily active user numbers are up 48 percent from 103 million during the same period in 2015. That said, its user base in Europe and the rest of the world were up year-over-year, but growth slowed in the second half of 2016. \nIn Europe, daily actives increased from 53 percent year-over-year to 52 million, while DAUs in the rest of the world grew to 39 million, a 58 percent increase over the prior year. But just looking at the graphs you can see pretty stagnant usage in the last two quarters of 2016. \nWhile Snapchat user numbers have increased, the amount of time users spend on the app has continued to rise. A year ago, users were spending an average of TK minutes on the app and watching a total of TK billion videos each day. Snap reported that video views have grown to 10 billion a day at the end of 2016. Daily Active Users: 158 million, up 48% year-over-year U.S. DAUs: 68 million, up 40% YoY Europe DAUs: 52 million, up 53% YoY Rest of world: 39 million, up 58% YoY Snaps created daily: 2.5 billion Average # of visits per day: 18 Average time spent: 25-30 minutes/day \nThe easy and somewhat obvious comparison to make is to Facebook, which is by far the largest social platform and has the largest user base. In its earnings report Wednesday, Facebook said it has 1.2 billion daily active users, who spend an average of 50 minutes per day on its different apps and services. \nThe Facebook comparison is imperfect for a few reasons. First, Facebook counts user and engagement stats across its website and mobile apps, while Snapchat has a single mobile app. More importantly, Snapchat is only about five years old, while Facebook has been around since 2004 and has been public since 2012. \nBut while Facebook has always seen the international market as a growth opportunity, Snap looks like it might have trouble converting new users outside of the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:02:17.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
