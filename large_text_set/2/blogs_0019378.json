They are fantastic. Thank you,” Ranieri said as he drove away yesterday. \nOn how he was feeling, he said: “I feel good now, because what we achieved in Leicester – I hope it will happen again, but it will be very difficult.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:40:32.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
