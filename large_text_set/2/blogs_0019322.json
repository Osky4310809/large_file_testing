The East Coast hit caused massive backups when it landed in New York City last summer, but is now branching to the West Coast with an as-yet-undisclosed Westside location.\nThis job posting shows the dream is real, and everyone from Refinery 29 to LAist has shown off what’s to come (including a pool filled with sprinkles). But with the rainy season still upon us, the slated March opening could end up being a wetter one than anybody expected — not that it should dampen spirits for a museum entirely devoted to ice cream.\nBig news for bread lovers \nManresa Bread is coming to Los Angeles as part of a pop-up with Nick Montgomery and Akira Akuto of NOTO. The two-day event is going down at Esters Wine Shop in Santa Monica on Saturday and Baroo on Sunday, and will highlight breads, pastries, pastas and more.\nLA here we come! \nA post shared by Avery Ruzicka (@manresabread) on Feb 16, 2017 at 10:31am PST \nA first-timer’s look at Howlin’ Rays \nNever experienced the line at Howlin’ Rays in Chinatown? You can live vicariously through the process here instead, as writer Jordan Okun talks about his trials and tribulations in just waiting it out for a taste of that all-important Nashville hot chicken.\nA new Spin \nSpinfish Poke House has opened up its third location in Los Angeles, this one right in the thick of Little Tokyo. The Brunswig Square outlet is up and running now, following a grand opening party a couple of weeks ago.\nParis Baguette branches out \nNormally known as a bakery catering to diverse Asian tastes in primarily Asian neighborhoods, Paris Baguette is now branching out into the Valley with a new Encino location. The fast casual option lands at 17136 Ventura Blvd. and should open this week, marking somewhere around 50 domestic stores for the international company with nearly 4,000 locations globally.\nMore empanadas for all \nWant more empanadas in your life? Get to the Original Farmers Market soon, since their official Twitter account just confirmed that Nonna’s Empanadas from nearby W. Third Street will be extending to a second location inside the market soon.\nPies and drinks \nOne of the newer wine tasting rooms in Los Angeles, The Blending Lab , is hosting a wine pairing party with pies from The Pie Hole on March 4. You can get your tickets now, or show up at the door for some day-of action.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:33:44.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
