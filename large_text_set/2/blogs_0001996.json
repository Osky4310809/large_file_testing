I was really pleased to be asked but it's just not for me. They have rang two times since then and even suggested someone from the record label would call us as well.\" \nIt sounds like this happens quite a lot - have other reality TV contests been in touch as well? \n\" The Voice Kids messaged and called, and Little Big Shots messaged me.\" \nWhen did you start learning the guitar? \n\"I've been playing since I was six and have been performing live since I was nine.\" \nWhat are you listening to at the moment and what are you favourite artists? \n\"I'm really enjoying Blossoms. I was invited by Tim Burgess to play at Tim Peaks at Kendal Calling last year and he told me they were playing a secret set there. I got to meet them as well they are fantastic. \nTom 'Mouse' Smith performing onstage (Supplied) \n\"I love James Bay's songs and even jammed with him backstage at a festival. Catfish and The Bottlemen are great, I've played on stage with them and supported them in front of 5k people. \n\"Man Made are amazing as well, I went to see them last week and it was funny, their drummer Blair had played for me last year. I really like The Charlatans, so I'm putting it out there I'd like to play with them.\" \nYouâ€™re sharing a festival with some pretty big names at Kendall Calling this year, how does that feel? \n\"It's so exciting to be on the same line up as Brian Wilson, Stereophonics, Manic Street Preachers and Editors. I'm very lucky to be able watch them all close up. If it wasn't for festivals I wouldn't be able to see much live music at my age.\" \nWhat do you think of TV singing competitions in general? \n\"I don't mind watching them at all, they are kind of fun. Britain's Got Talent isn't just singers but I'm not sure what my mates would say if I was in a competition with a dog! \n\"I'm just at school - my music is just for me - I'm not bothered about someone judging it or giving me marks out of ten. I just wanted everyone to know that it wasn't for me. \n\"Everyone should do what they want - if that involves them being on a show like The Voice, then that is brilliant. I think I'm more of a music festival kind of kid.\" \nTom 'Mouse' Smith is performing at Kendal Calling Festival in April.
