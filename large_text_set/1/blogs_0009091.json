Two stand out. \nAmong the flood of baby and parenting-focused tech, Mattel's Aristotle is one of the most ambitious thanks to its split personality. Yes, it's another smart speaker with Alexa built into it. Prompt it with \"Hey, Aristotle,\" and you or your kids engage its alter-ego. \nAmong Aristotle's tricks, it can sing a baby back to sleep, read from a list of books, play games. It even has a manners option that requires your kids to say \"please\" before it will acknowledge a request. If that's not enough, it also comes with a camera for keeping an eye on your kid's room, a bracelet option to help track if your child has completed his or her chores, and, of course, the ability to trigger sound effects with compatible Mattel toys. Why even parent? \nKuri , from Mayfield Robotics, looks like a refugee from Pixar's Wall-e. It seems to have its own voice control tech ( other robots use Alexa ), and most importantly a ton of charm. \nCute-eyed Kuri will toodle along on the floor, patrolling the halls with its camera. It an play music and podcasts, tell you the weather, and even, supposedly, recognize faces. I'm skeptical of the market for free roaming bots that aren't vacuums. The utility doesn't seem to be there yet to sway city dwellers to let a floor drone mess up the already cramped flow of a 1,000 square foot apartment. Sony's Aibo, of course, showed that consumers can fall in love with a robot. For those with the square footage to spare, Kuri looks to have that kind of appeal. 57 Check out all the smart home products at CES 2017 (so far) What else? \nAlongside these larger trends, the more traditional smart home hardware--lights, switches, locks--were present here too. If you didn't hear much from Apple and its HomeKit smart home service at the show, it's because most of its news centered around these kinds of products, which aren't as flashy as cars and fridges and robots. \nApple expanded its reach this year, as usual, via its partners, who introduced cameras , security systems , and, finally, a Chamberlain garage door opener to its platform. That's all new stuff that will make HomeKit even more capable. The big question for Apple remains whether it will bring out its own Echo or Google Home competitor to add a truly seamless voice companion to the home environment. Until that happens, or until Apple introduces a better alternative, I suspect HomeKit won't benefit as much from the present hype surrounding voice control at home. That may not matter in the long run. It's still morning in the smart home. But it won't be forever. \nOne last note: Don't sleep on the cable companies and other service providers who have entered this field. Comcast in particular is taking this market very seriously.
