By Jenny Hadfield Thursday, February 23, 2017, 2:31 pm Ewald Sadie \nHeather asks: I hear other runners talk about tempo runs . Can you explain what a tempo workout is? \nTempo workouts are one of my favorites because you run at an effort that feels strong and you feel stronger and fitter after they end.

I refer to the intensity of the workout via color, using yellow, orange, and red zones to denote easy, moderately challenging, and hard. Tempo effort is best described as comfortably hard: It’s somewhere between the top of your orange zone and bottom of your red zone. High-Five Tempo Workout \nThis is a great workout for those who are new to running tempos because it breaks the tempo portion down into shorter segments. But don’t let that fool you—this is a challenging workout. Warm up by walking for three minutes. Run at an easy, yellow-zone effort for five minutes. Repeat four times: Run at tempo effort for five minutes, followed by two minutes of easy jogging. Run at an easy, yellow-zone effort for five minutes. Cool down by walking for three minutes. \nTOTAL TIME 44 minutes Break It in Two Tempo Workout \nThis builds your stamina to run at this effort for longer, 10-minute segments. Warm up by walking for three minutes. Run at an easy, yellow-zone effort for five minutes. Run at tempo effort for 10 minutes, followed by three minutes of easy jogging. Repeat. Run at an easy, yellow-zone effort for five minutes. Cool down by walking for three minutes. \nTOTAL TIME 39 minutes The Classic Tempo Workout \nThis is the most traditional of these tempo workouts, with a warmup period, a solid block of time spent at tempo effort, and a cooldown period. Warm up by walking for three minutes. Run at an easy, yellow-zone effort for 10 minutes. Run at tempo effort for 20 to 30 minutes. (Start with 20 the first time you do this workout, then gradually ramp up as you become more experienced.) Run at an easy, yellow-zone effort for 10 minutes. Cool down by walking for three minutes. \nTOTAL TIME 46 to 56 minutes The Hilly Tempo Workout \nThis workout teaches you how to run tempo effort on a hilly course to gain strength and stamina. Run this on a hilly route or use a hill program on a treadmill. The key is to keep your effort no greater than tempo effort on the uphills and no less than on the downhills, which means slowing on the ups and pushing on the downs. Warm up by walking for three minutes. Run at an easy, yellow-zone effort for 10 minutes. Run at tempo effort for 20 to 30 minutes, adjusting your pace as you climb and descend. (Start with 20 the first time you do this workout, then gradually ramp up as you become more experienced.) Run at an easy, yellow-zone effort for 10 minutes. Cool down by walking for three minutes. \nTOTAL TIME 46 to 56 minutes \n* * * \nAsk Coach Jenny a running question on the AskCoachJenny Facebook page or on Twitter , get her latest posts via email , and listen to her podcast .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:44:14.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
