(Source: Reuters) \nVideo content is the new fashion among social media websites, where most of them are focussing on live content to grow in the market. Twitter’s latest push on its platform will be its live video service. According to The Information, the social media giant will unveil the live streaming service by next week. The report cited two individuals who have information about Twitter’s plans, and they said that the new feature will help media companies to post live streaming videos directly on the platform. They were quoted as saying that Twitter will start its live-streaming API which will give media companies the option of plugging directly into Twitter’s software. Currently, these firms have to strike a deal with Twitter or use the Periscope application which Twitter acquired in 2015. \nAccording to the report, the social media company will also tie up with firms to get back-end services for live video streaming. Twitter has reportedly been concentrating on striking streaming deals with various organisations, for a long time. This has bene a focus mainly because, despite Periscope’s acceptance, it could not quite manage to become a hit among the masses. Twitter also had to shut down Vine, another video streaming service app, because it wanted to make its own streaming service better instead of third-party apps. This is Twitter’s bet against giants like Facebook and YouTube. \nYou may also like to watch: \nFacebook had recently pushed its video offerings to make people spend more time on Facebook. Live-videos were announced later and became a hit among individuals and companies alike. Twitter has also jumped on the bandwagon with hope to turn around its fortunes. It is expected that Twitter, like Facebook, will pay media partners in a bid to create more content for the social media platform. There might also be some TV-themed content, according to some reports. \nTwitter has the capability of generating good live content as it is much more dynamic than Facebook it could add this to its advantage, despite lacking in the user base which the latter enjoys. It was also visible during the Oscars 2017 telecast.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T13:37:58.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
