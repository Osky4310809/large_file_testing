Dedicated bike paths are needed to allow both new and experienced cyclists to ride safely, without having to use main roads, says Nakheel. \nWork is already under way on a 5 km track at Nakheel’s new Nad Al Sheba community, currently under construction along Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road in Dubai. Other developments covered by phase one are Jumeirah Islands, Jumeirah Heights, Jumeirah Park, Jumeirah Village (Triangle and Circle), Al Furjan, The Gardens, Discovery Gardens and Garden View Villas. \nNakheel Chairman Ali Rashid Lootah said: “Cycling in Dubai has seen a huge surge in popularity over the last few years, with the Government promoting the sport through world class events like the Dubai Tour and by building hundreds of kilometres of bike routes across the city. \n“Our new cycle track network will make cycling more accessible and inspire people to get pedalling as a way to keep fit, socialise and help the environment. Under our plan, people will be able to bike their way to the shops, school and friends’ houses without getting in the car. \n“Our plan will encourage people to take up cycling as a sport and recreational activity, in turn promoting health and fitness among all age groups. It will also offer something for experienced riders, who will benefit from new routes linked to Dubai’s existing bike path network as well as our 10 km super loop.” \nThe new routes will pass through some of Nakheel’s most mature and prestigious communities, where cyclists’ journeys will be enhanced by lush scenery and greenery. \nThe Nakheel Communities Cycling Masterplan at a glance:  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T09:02:44.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
