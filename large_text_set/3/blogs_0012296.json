The Thunder defeated the Nets 122-104. AP \nNew York, United States — Russell Westbrook edged closer to Oscar Robertson’s long-standing triple-double record after leading the Oklahoma City Thunder to a comfortable 122-104 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday. \nWestbrook brought up his remarkable 33rd   with 25 points, 19 assists and 12 rebounds as the Thunder improved to 38-29. \nThe Oklahoma City talisman is now just eight shy of Robertson’s record season tally of 41 triple-doubles. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe Barclays Center crowd enjoyed a love-hate relationship with Westbrook on the night, subjecting him both to boos and chants of “MVP” in recognition of his stellar season. \nThe crowd united in a standing ovation however when he grabbed a defensive rebound with 4:40 left in the fourth quarter to complete his latest triple. \nIt was a third consecutive victory for Oklahoma City, who also saw guard Victor Oladipo finish with 21 points and center Enes Kanter add 17 off the bench. \nThe win was also Oklahoma City’s first on the road since a defeat of New Orleans in late January. \nBrook Lopez top-scored for the Nets with 25 points, with guard Jeremy Lin adding 24 points and Randy Foy 13.
