He replaces Ms. Gintarė Narkevičiūtė , who successfully held this position for over five years. Žygimantas Pavilionis and Gintarė Narkevičiūtė \nSuch a sudden change of the Foreign Secretary of the TS-LKD has surprised many, so The Lithuania Tribune has asked the departing Narkevičiūtė to comment on the situation: “My party and my country need me at home!”, - she says cheerfully, and tells us what is behind this move. \n“Frankly speaking, it is a step for which I have been preparing for quite a while but we had to ensure that the right candidate to take over emerged so I could find the best time ‘to return home’. Additionally, Gabrielius Landsbergis (leader of the TS-KLD - the Lithuania Tribune) has just been re-elected Chairman of our party, holding a strong position to continue bringing change and renewal,’ Narkevičiūtė said.

Landsbergis outlines planned changes for the Conservatives \nShe continued: “In order to lead politically and implement a new plan for Lithuania, a robust, energetic, yet professional team of leaders is necessary for the future. But we also need this now. For this very reason, I find the timing perfect to return home where I can bring back my experience to assist my own citizens. Even more so, my biggest wish is to reconnect with Lithuanian society and take an even deeper look on everyday problems that our people are facing, particularly in the regions.” \n“Eventually, continuation of my work internationally is unavoidable and it would be a mistake to lose a potential connection that has been built up throughout these past years. However, my homeland is calling me and I am excited to enter this new phase. Therefore, I am thankful to my successor Dr. Žygimantas Pavilionis, who has accepted to take over the responsibility of International Secretary,” Narkevičiūtė concluded.
