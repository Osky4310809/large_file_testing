We value partners as we seek strengthened existing friendships even as we pursue new ones,” he said. \n“We believe that friends help each other and utilize constructive engagement to achieve common goals. In truth, we all share the same aspiration of greater peace, progress and prosperity,” the President added. \nThe President has been trumpeting his desire for an “independent” foreign policy since his falling out with the US, which called his attention to reports of rising human rights abuses in the conduct of his vicious war on drugs. In one of his speeches, he even rained expletives on outgoing US President Barack Obama. \nThe United Nations and the European Union also drew Duterte’s ire for the same reason. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nIn his speech, he defended his campaign against illegal drugs before the gathering of ambassadors. \nUS Ambassador Sung Kim and Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jiantao were on opposite sides of Rizal Hall during the reception. \nExecutive Secretary Salvador Medialdea was seen talking with the US ambassador, along with Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa and top military officials who milled around Kim. \nZhao and Russian Ambassador Igor Khovaev were seen separately talking with some Cabinet secretaries. \nBy veering away from the US, Duterte has openly cozied up to China and Russia, with which he vowed greater cooperation militarily and economically. \n“In a world that recognizes our interconnectedness and respect each others’ sovereign independence, the horizons and frontiers of cooperation are virtually limitless,” Duterte said. \n“Friendship, after all, knows no bounds. The Philippines has and will continue to build on our friendship founded on a common objective, shared values and time honored principles of international law,” he added, without directly discussing the arbitral ruling on the South China Sea and West Philippine Sea dispute. \nWith the Philippines assuming ASEAN chairmanship this year, Duterte also appealed for “mutual beneficial collaboration” among nations. \n“Let us together work to further expand the areas of mutual beneficial collaboration. This New Year, the Philippines takes on the ASEAN chairmanship with renewed fervor, a sense of purpose,” he said. \n“It is an opportunity to exercise leadership to advance the regional development agenda of forging a rules-based community that puts citizens’ welfare at the heart of every initiative. The Philippines counts on your full support,” Duterte added. \n“For the New Year more than anything, I wish for deeper and more meaningful engagements with our partners and friends,” he said, before proposing a toast. \nDuterte drank apple cider instead of the champagne served to the guests. \n“This will allow us to realize the positive and lasting changes that we seek for our nations, for our region and for our world,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:34:22.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
