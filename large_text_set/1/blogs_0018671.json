The title (along with its various home console ports) was one of the most fun basketball games ever made. Sadly, the franchise is somewhat on the erratic side, and it is rare when a new game is released (the last one came out in 2011). The NBA2K series is all well and good, but the world could certainly use an NBA Jam that features current players.\nA new official NBA Jam may not see the light of day anytime soon. Thankfully, the original game has been modded by Hogs with a Blog to have a modern roster. This includes players like LeBron James and Steph Curry. Though the game features modern players, it still has the old logos and team names. It also has classic players like Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Patrick Ewing, and Kobe Bryant.\nOne of the more fun aspects of the old NBA Jam games were the weird guest players. People such as Bill Clinton, Prince Charles, Will Smith, and Marv Albert were all selectable secret characters. This modded version includes Kanye West, Donald Trump, and (not surprisingly) Harambe.\nPersonally speaking, I think this mod is brilliant. I’ve been a fan of NBA Jam since it made its debut so seeing this brings me a great deal of pleasure. I still prefer the old-school rosters (because I’m old and don’t watch modern basketball), but I do appreciate seeing fans updating the game to reflect the current NBA lineup. I also have to give them props for including wacky modern-day celebrities like Kanye West and Donald Trump.\nNBA Jam 2017 is playable via a SNES emulator.
