Cleveland shot 60 percent from the field, 63 percent from deep and LeBron James picked up his 10th triple-double of the season â€“ 16 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists. \nBut even in a lopsided victory, a team isnâ€™t always on the same page. \nAfter grabbing one of his 11 rebounds, James looked to push the tempo, taking a quick dribble as he tried to gain a head of steam with the Cavs leading by 32 in the third quarter.
