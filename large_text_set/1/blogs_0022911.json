Anne Helen Petersen ID: 10419227 At that moment, a black woman came up to the friars and pressed a medallion into one of their hands. “Thank you so much for being here,” she said. “It’s hard for me to be here because of some of the things listed up there on that banner. But the Franciscans get it.”\n\nThe march passed massive billboards depicting graphic, bloody scenes; one, featuring a demon holding a baby and the declaration that “Abortion Is Child Sacrifice,” was accompanied by a loudspeaker blaring a loop of a wailing baby. Parents shielded their childrens’ eyes; teens audibly said “ew, gross.” This was not part of the March for Life brand, and several men went up to the people manning the billboards to complain. “Do you think you’re doing God’s will right now?” one asked.\nAs the march neared its end point at the steps of the Supreme Court, I spotted a man with a bushy beard and a stocking cop with a sign that read “ PRO-LIFE NOT PRO-TRUMP .” “I can’t tell you how many people have come up to me and said they like my sign,” he told me. Nearby was Liz McCloskey, the woman holding a “PRO-LIFE PRO-WOMAN ANTI-TRUMP” sign. “People who value life also take issue with Trump,” she explained. “And they take issue with Trump because he values very little.”\n“That’s the problem with being a single-issue voter,” she continued. “No one can be completely consistent in how they vote. I’ll never find someone who values the complete ethic of what I believe. But it does a disservice to women’s issues to be so focused. Abortion is not going to become illegal. It’s just not going to happen. We’re having the wrong conversation. Why don’t we talk more about how we reduce it? How do we keep it legal, safe, and also that thing that’s seemed to have dropped out of the conversation, rare ?”\n“The national conversation about abortion is so impoverished,” she said, shaking her head. “And I mean that on both sides.”\nA twentysomething woman cut across the crowd. “Oh my god, can I get a selfie with you?” she asked. She held up her own sign, with its call to be Pro-Life, Anti-Racism, Anti-Wall, Anti-Ableism, Pro-Environment, Anti-Sex Trafficking, and Pro-Health Care, and smiled wide, framing the Supreme Court in the background.\nView this image › \nID: 10419230 Earlier in the day, Pence told the audience that “to heal our land and restore a culture of life, we must continue to be a movement that embraces all, care for all, and shows respect for the dignity and worth of every person.” It’s a statement of basic American values — one I’d heard from several of the marchers I spoke with, espousing a broad sentiment that, along with “don’t kill babies,” had underpinned the movement’s brand for years.\n\nBut I also heard that idea countered, in ways large and small, throughout the day: when a speaker at ProLifeCon told the person sitting next to her that she’d just returned from San Francisco with a cold, “but thank God that’s all I caught”; when a college student from Alabama showed off a sign featuring Pepe the Frog, avatar of the so-called alt-right and white nationalism, with the slogan “wouldn’t let me be a papa so I stayed Pepe”; and when Brandon Buell proclaimed, “We’re not just pro-life … I’m also anti-gay, which is now designated as a hate group.” But I heard it most forcefully as the marchers returned to their hotel rooms, wind-burned and hoarse, and the White House announced an executive order, banning travel from seven majority Muslim countries, including refugees from Iraq and Syria.\nUnder Trump, the anti-abortion brand has never been stronger — but the tenets of a full pro-life movement are increasingly under siege.\nView this image › \nEman Mohammed \nID: 10419167", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T19:42:24.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
