(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Trump immigration ban applies to dual citizenship By Joel Gehrke ( @Joelmentum ) • 1/28/17 3:38 PM Joel Gehrke Foreign Affairs Reporter The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/Gehrke-3.jpg More \nPresident Trump 's restriction on travel from terror-stricken countries applies to individuals with dual nationality, according to the State Department. \n\"Travelers who have nationality or dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States or be issued an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa,\" a State Department official said in a statement to the Washington Examiner . \"Those nationals or dual nationals holding valid immigrant or nonimmigrant visas will not be permitted to enter the United States during this period. Visa interviews will generally not be scheduled for nationals of these countries during this period.\" \nIndividuals who match that description could still receive visas on a case-by-case basis, however. Those details emerged as the implementation of the order — which restricts travel from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen for 90 days — led to the detention of refugees in transit to the United States and sparked a political fight between Trump's team and congressional opponents. \nThe order applies to green card holders and individuals who have already been approved to enter the country, leading to confusion as refugees who were in transit to the United States were detained upon arrival on Friday. Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked in Iraq as U.S. Army interpreter, dubbed the United States \"the land of freedom\" and \"the greatest nation\" after he was released. \nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.

They put the cuffs on,\" he told reporters after his release. \"You know how many soldiers I touch by this hand?\" \nRefugees go through extensive vetting before being admitted to the United States, but terrorist attacks in Europe as well as the San Bernardino shooting — one of the shooters was a Pakistani national who received a fiance(e) visa to the U.S. — stoked concern in Congress and among Republican voters that the federal government cannot adequately vet refugees. \n\"This suspension provided for in the Executive Order will allow us to review current screening procedures, while protecting national security – our top priority when issuing visas,\" the State Department official said in the statement. \"The U.S. government's national security visitor screening and vetting procedures are constantly reviewed and refined to improve security and more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the United States. We welcome every opportunity to continue to review and improve our systems and procedures.\" Top Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T02:14:31.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
