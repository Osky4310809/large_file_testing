Melissa was hospitalized with serious injuries, but Kurt did not survive. \nThe couple was in London to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary, and they also were visiting Melissa’s parents, who work as missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Cochrans were traveling in Germany and Austria in the days prior to the incident, and they planned on returning to the United States on Thursday. \n“Our hearts are broken this day as we say good-bye to our dear brother-in-law Kurt,” Melissa’s brother, Clinton Payne , wrote online. “Our hearts ache for her and their children in losing their loving companion and father. Please continue to pray for our family.” \nBritish law enforcement has taken at least seven people into custody as they continue to investigate the terror attack. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the rampage , saying online that the perpetrator was a “soldier” acting on their message. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:30:09.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
