Pls don’t listen to all the xtian fanatics, do what is in the best interest of the kids. If your educational policies are based on getting the best result for the money then stick to it regardless of the noise from the religious wackos. \nThey hate you not because of your policies but because you are devout Muslims and your looks scares the living daylights out of them. Be who you are and let your records speaks for you. Well done again. John \nIf he has no hidden agenda, he should rather emulate Gov. Peter Obi of Anambra state, who not only returned the schools to their original owners, but he is still providing funds for them and the results are there for all to see. it did not stop these schools from admitting students of other faiths. \nThe forceful take over of schools by government is one of the major reasons for our educational woes, where there is no morality and values again. It is high-time the governor reversed this unpopular policy, afterall the government is meant to serve the people and majority of them has rejected this policy. \nWhy is he now forcing this policy down the throat of the masses. Is this the meaning of progressive, at times it beats my imagination me that we all we criticize PDP and GEJ who do at times listens and has the courage to change some of their positions on some national and party issues, but it seems to me that the opposition parties are very dictatorial and insensitive, and this is where my fears lies. . . Malik Awodoyin \nThe schools in osun had been under the care of govt since the days of Uncle Bola Ige. Religion is not our issue in Osun. It is the likes of Oritsajefor that are promoting the religion disharmony among us. The politicians that have nothing to offer is using this as a campaign tool. We are going to vote for the best in Osun. Once again, RELIGION IS NOT OUR PROBLEM. Johnl Obabueki \ni wish you the best. did you notice there was no baptist minister at the opening of a baptist school. The Nigerian quagmire \nSo? Who cares? The Nigerian quagmire \nPeter Obi? The same religious wacko that is giving away states money to churches? You guys are just bunch of hypocrites. What a joke, you just mentioned the worst offender to be emulated. He’s only getting away with it cos he’s a xtian and the CAN see nothing wrong in his actions. Pls give me a break. Aviator \nObi is a snake and a fraud…..Aregesola is on a higher pedrestal of leadership…..mind your Anambra after the worst elections ever! we are wiser in the SW, we know an achiever must be criticized by disguntled elements. Dre Peters \nOK o. We don hear you o. anonymous \nAll this gathering of OOni etc na fake PR ,no go work.We all know which party Ooni prefers, not with Omisore declaring.The royal father just decided to honour the invites as any good father will do (do you throw away the child with the bath).All this last minute patronising will not work.Even though Osun is heavily divided in terms of religion with a big fraction of religious intolerance in places like Iwo,what will prevail in 2015election is not religion but sensibility because the state is highly educated, ,Imams will be sent to the mosques and pastors to the church,its only secularity that will prevail (religious fanaticism is an opium for the poor evil to use religion to blackmail people for vote,its is smelly ) segzy \nWait and see, people are wise now, osun now experience what they call massive development. Your rigging plot will not work. We are waiting osun people are waiting Aregbe carry goo anonymous \nI can see you seem to be a political thug, I don’t belong to any party, l am solely independent, but we are watching both of your parties.To me ,when one brings religion into service delivery ,that guy is confused and short of ideas ( so goes any of the Governors in Nigeria), and that whats wrong with your state right now, unfortunately you can’t give more than what you have so says your story.,with people like you (hero-worshipers and not able to think outside the box)in that state, there is no progression Aviator \nhave you been to osun lately? if not don’t talk! Johnl Obabueki \nhmmm aregbe i wish you the best. but did you notice there was no baptist minister at the opening of a baptist school. Aviator \nwhat has baptist minister got to do with elementary school? or na dem go vote? Aregbesola is doing a good job and no religious confusionist can stop it. Sola Olayanju \nWhat has education policy do with wearing Hijab to schools, changing the old school names? What policy makes every body wear the same and cannot distinguish which school is that? Must you merge every school together before the pupils have a qualitative education? The Gov is being economical with the truth, his agenda will be exposed, he can put wool on our face. Does every student in America school wear the same uniform? No apology for being a christian and being proactive in bequeathing a good legacies to the state and Nigeria in general.
