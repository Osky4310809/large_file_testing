Color Overlay: Jason Torchinsky Take a moment and imagine an astronaut riding a motorcycle on the moon. Congrats! You will never imagine anything cooler in your entire life. What’s surprising is this nearly became a reality.\nAdvertisement \n\nI was alerted of the existence of the “lunar motorbike” yesterday by one of Jalopnik’s specially-trained carrier pigeons with a printed out copy of this tweet tied to its leg:\n\nNeither I nor fellow Spacelopnik correspondent Jason Torchinsky had ever seen this thing before, and I quickly set myself on finding an official government record of its existence.\nAdvertisement \n\nI was unable to find one.\nThat is not to say there is no information on this vehicle. A number of secondary sources discuss its existence. The most trustworthy is likely the book Apollo: The Lost and Forgotten Missions , linked out by this NASA Spaceflight forum back in 2014. The book gives the following brief account:\nVarious modes of transporting astronauts across the lunar surface were evaluated for the Apollo programme. Here a suited engineer evaluates a lunar motorbike in Building 29 at MSC. He is attached to a hardness device that removes 5/6 of his Earth weight and that of the bike, allowing an accurate 1/6-g evaluation of the device. Other tests were performed in flying the KC-135 aircraft in parabolic curves to reproduce a 1/6 gravity environment in short 20-30-second bursts.\nThe lunar bike was not alone as a never-made-it mode of lunar transportation. We had a couple different vehicle proposals that got scrapped, including a fully-sealed and large-scale MOLAB that NASA actually favored back in 1963.\n\nNASA's Moon-Bound Geology Lab that Never Quite Got Off the Ground NASA&apos;s Moon-Bound Geology Lab that Never Quite Got Off the Ground NASA&apos;s Moon-Bound Geology Lab that Never Quite… The rigor of operating outside the atmosphere has often led to rather outlandish NASA vehicle… Read more Read more \nWhat got the lunar motorbike was that we never really needed it, as AmericaSpace explained in 2012:\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:38:55.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
