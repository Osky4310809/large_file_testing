He died at a hospital.\nWilkins drank three shots of vodka and a beer in her car before driving but the defence argued there hadn’t been enough time for her blood-alcohol level to exceed the legal limit of .08.\nInvestigators said Wilkins’ blood-alcohol level was about twice that limit 1 1/2 hours after the crash.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:07:14.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
