The mid-engined, two-seater coupe will be built at Alpine’s factory in Dieppe, France, priced at 58,500 euro (RM275,197) with deliveries set to commence later this year for continental Europe. \nWith powertrain details confirmed, the new Alpine A110 in fact uses a new, 1.8 litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine developed by the Renault-Nissan Alliance. A setup comprising an A110-specific air intake, turbocharger, exhaust system and engine tune brings forth peak power of 252 PS, with 320 Nm of torque. Combined fuel consumption on the NEDC cycle is 6.2 L/100 km, with CO2 emissions of 140 g/km. \nA Getrag seven-speed, wet-clutch dual-clutch gearbox is installed with ratios chosen specifically for Alpine. With a before-options kerb weight of 1,080 kg, it translates to a power-to-weight ratio of 233 PS per tonne, and a claimed 0-100 km/h time of 4.5 seconds. Top speed is electronically-limited to 250 km/h. \nVariable driving modes allow the driver choose from Road, Sport or Track, in which settings for the engine and transmission, steering, suspension, ESC intervention as well as the instrument display can be selected for different levels of ferocity. \nHarnessing the powerplant’s outputs is a suspension setup comprising double wishbones front and rear, while stopping power comes courtesy of a Brembo kit, featuring 320 mm-diameter rotors front and rear. Four-piston fixed calipers feature in front, and single-piston floating calipers do the job at the back. Lightweight 18-inch wheels are shod in 205/40R18 tyres in front, and 235/40R18 at the rear. \nA flat underbody is aimed at optimising aerodynamics, paired with a rear diffuser which Alpine says allows the A110 to combine “low drag with significant downforce.” Air inlets in the front bumper improve airflow around the front wheel wells, thus reducing drag. Alpine claims the A110’s drag coefficient value of 0.32 is among the lowest in the sports car segment. \nThe limited-run Première Edition will be available in Alpine Blue, Noir Profond (black) or Blanc Solaire (white), while the 18-inch wheels get a Première Edition-specific, diamond-turned finish. A lightweight active exhaust system features, as does a Focal sound system. Interior trim includes matte carbon-fibre accents, brushed aluminium pedals and one-piece Sabelt sports seats, trimmed in quilted leather.
