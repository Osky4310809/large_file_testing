I’m being vague, I refer to quadcopter style drones you can control with your smartphone or tablet.\nHigher-end drones still rely on a dedicated remote for actual flight controls, but many toy class units fly using nothing more than an app and a WiFi or Bluetooth connection. Let’s take a look at some of the best on the market today.\nWe will regularly update this post with new and exciting drones that you can control with your phone. This month we updated a few prices, mostly in your favor, then officially added the DJI Mavic Pro.

This sometimes means premium hardware, and sometimes premium experiences through software or features. In the case of their drones, most are able to be flown entirely using just your smartphone. They still offer a controller if you need more, but more than just the basics are only an app away.\nThe Bebop 2 is one of the newest drones from Parrot, a feature packed quadcopter with a number of autonomous flying modes and a fairly capable camera.\nYour smartphone acts as controller as well as FPV viewer for the Bebop 2, using their app , called FreeFlight 3, you’ll get the basics for free, then fork over some cash via in-app-payments to unlock advanced flying modes.\nCheck out our Parrot Bebop 2 drone hands-on review \nThe Parrot Bebop 2 can be had for as low as $399 for just the drone, but look to spend about $599 to get the whole package with FPV goggles , dedicated controller and more.\nBuy the Parrot Bebop 2 now Hubsan X4 H501S Pro Also seen in our Hubsan drones at CES video \n\nWe spent some time with Hubsan at CES behind closed doors, they have some interesting and fun stuff in the pipeline, but next to hit the market will be the new Pro version of the brushless H501S. Despite using their advanced controller with FPV video screen, you can actually fly this drone, as with many other Hubsan drones, using just the app.\nThey have a special tiny controller in the works that seems little more than a phone dock, which, to be fair, is basically what it is. Put your phone to use on a number of Hubsan drones, including the X4 H501S Pro. or the lesser expensive X4 H501S Brushless for $268 on Amazon today.\nBuy the Hubsan H501S now DBPower UDI 818A Also seen in our Cheap drones guide \n\nCompatible with VR goggles, this is another FPV flyer.

Parrot is not offering both in one device, but the MiniDrone Rolling Spider has large wheels that can spin along, adding a new level of fun and safety to indoor flying. These are not powered wheels, but they do protect the drone from crashing, allow you to scoot along the floor when there is not enough battery life left to take off, and have fun ‘crawling’ up walls when there is power.\nEquipped with a small camera, this small drone is controlled by smartphone or tablet and can be yours for $40 on Amazon .\nBUY THE PARROT MINDRONE SPIDER NOW Sphero BB-8 Not on any other list, but it’s Star Wars! \nWhat is a drone? The military builds them as highly capable unmanned aircraft for reconnaissance and more, the toy store says it’s a flying multi-rotor remote controlled toy, but if we are to be fairly exact about it, we’re looking at an unmanned craft of pretty much any sort. Under the water, in the air or across the ground, whether autonomous or remote controlled, there are many types of drones, and within these guidelines, Sphero’s BB-8 has got to be one of our favorite.\nControl BB-8 with your smartphone, roll along the ground and enjoy some fun sound effects, augmented reality stories and more.

DJI is the primary player in this setup, most of their drones are made to control by remote, but then use your phone as FPV video screen.\nOur favorite DJI Mavic Pro is a primary example of this, your connected phone displays what the camera on the drone sees. Further, you can control the camera from the phone and you initiate most advanced flying modes from the app on your mobile device.\nIn this regard, there are many, many drones that you can control, at least in part, using your smartphone.\nIn terms of VR capabilities with your smartphone and your drone, head on over to our partner site VRSource for David Imel’s take on the best VR drones .\nDJI Mavic Pro Also seen in our Best drones list, Best camera drones , Best professional drones and DJI Drones guide \n\nWe hesitated to add this here, the Mavic Pro , as with other DJI drones that can be controlled via smartphone, benefit greatly using the controller and smartphone in combination. Thing is, there is a WiFi mode that allows you to take control using just your phone. Range is limited, capabilities are not all utilized, but you can do it. Take the control method out of the equation and I can do nothing more than gush at how great of a drone you are getting here; the compact, folding design is unrivaled today, particularly in this capable of a 4K video recording drone with excellent autonomous features.\nLearn more about the Mavic Pro \nDJI Mavic Pro review \nDJI Mavic Pro camera review \nUnboxing the DJI Mavic Pro \nCheck out the DJI Mavic Pro for $999 as the base package, $1299 in the Fly More bundle from Amazon today.\nBuy the DJI Mavic Pro now Wrap-up That sums up some of the best drones you can fly using your smartphone or tablet.
