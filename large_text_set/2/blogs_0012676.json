The report revealed that last year, Samsung led the pack with a 24.8 percent market share, followed by Lenovo (including Moto) with an 8.9 percent share. However, the tastiest tidbit from the report is that Reliance Retail’s LYF smartphone brand, which made its debut in January 2016, quickly captured a large chunk of the market with a 7.1 percent share last year. \nThe report reveals that Reliance Retail’s LYF brand saw a massive annual growth of 2,122.7 percent. The company launched its first set of budget 4G and VoLTE-enabled Android smartphones named after the four elements – Earth, Flame (Fire), Water and Wind. In a short period of five months, by May 2016, the brand became the fifth largest smartphone maker in the country in terms of shipment volumes. During the January – March quarter, the company became the second largest LTE phone supplier following Samsung. \nThe bundled free Reliance Jio SIM with unlimited data (FUP 1GB / day), unlimited free calls and access to Jio’s premium suite of apps has helped LYF to capture a large market share in such a short time. LYF smartphones start at as low as Rs 2,999, and go up to Rs 19,999. Reliance Retail is now also rumoured to launch 4G and VoLTE-enabled feature phones in the country soon, which will further strengthen its foothold in the market, and likely help it enter the overall mobile phone market share in India which comprises of both smartphones and feature phones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:58:03.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
