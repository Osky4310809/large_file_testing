Ski. Beers and appetizers at the bar, which overlooks the mountain (I like to spend apres and breakfast picking out my lines for the day). A quick cat nap. Then, the “quadbathalon”— a dip in the heated pool, then the hot tub, then back in the pool, then the sauna, pool and, finally, the steam room. Dinner (in the Rustler’s dining room, where the rotating menu that includes wagu beef medallions, chicken and lamb and a list of mainstays such as salmon, salads, strip steaks and miso soup). Sleep — but not before 9:30 p.m. Courtesy of David Paul Jesse Paul makes his way down Eagle’s Nest at Alta in January. \nOur routine is entirely about the skiing. There’s no town with posh designer stores, and you won’t find a long list of fine-dining restaurants. There’s no nightclub to go to and beer from the tap is low in alcohol because of Utah’s liquor laws. Apres-skiing basically means taking a nap. \nFor me, the things that Alta lacks are what make it great. \nA monster storm that dropped 80 inches of snow closed the ski area the day before we arrived. On the dicey drive up to the lodge, we passed a shuttle van that had been taken out by an avalanche in Little Cottonwood Canyon. \nYes, we got snow in Colorado this year. But this snow — light and fluffy stuff from the Great Salt Lake — is different. \nFor the first three days we were there, the temperature stayed below freezing. It snowed so hard that we couldn’t see. Powder flying up into my goggles blinded me on every turn. I found myself having to stop frequently because the face shots made it feel like I was skiing in the dark. When the sun finally broke through the clouds, there was so much powder that once we could see where we were going, it felt like we were on a whole new mountain. \nI rode my powder skis for four straight days. I didn’t use them once this season in Colorado. \nIt wasn’t surprising to ski powder in Alta, or to see so much snow. On average, Alta boasts more than 500 inches of snow each year. (That’s at least 100 inches more than what most Colorado ski areas typically get.) A post shared by David Berthiaume (@davidberthiaume) on Jan 27, 2017 at 2:47pm PST \nAlta has everything an experienced skier would want, including hike-to runs, cliff lines and steep, soft snow. Dad — he refused to jump off the cliffs — and I skied all of it, hard, for five days. So while I struggled to walk onto my flight home, there was a grin under my goggle tan. \nDon’t get me wrong, I love skiing in Colorado. But Alta is another world. Maybe it’s not having to battle my way along I-70, or the ease of waking up slopeside. Maybe it’s being with my dad. \nEither way, the no-nonsense, hyper-challenging resort isn’t just a break from Colorado’s slopes. It’s a way to keep the flame that is my love for skiing alive and remind me why I-70 is worth it. If you go \nGetting there: There are plenty of flights between Denver and Salt Lake. It’s possible to snag a roundtrip ticket for around $200. Flights are about an hour; driving to Alta is around 8 hours. Shuttles to Alta are relatively cheap, so renting a car isn’t necessary. \nLift tickets: Less than $100 . Alta is also on the Mountain Collective pass (around $400, depending on time of purchase), which includes two days each at 14 resorts across the country, including Snowbird (next-door to Alta), plus Taos, Aspen and Telluride, and resorts in Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Chile; every day after the two is half off. \nRustler Lodge: Like most of the lodges at Alta, the Rustler is a one-stop shop that includes a rental store and a restaurant that serves dinner and breakfast (price included with your room). Suites go for upwards of $500 a night; dorm rooms — with bunk beds and a shared bathroom — are under $200 during the regular and shoulder seasons. 10380 E.
