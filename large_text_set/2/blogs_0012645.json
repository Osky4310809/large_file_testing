Investigators also discovered a shelf full of opened schnapps bottles in that room, concluding that the abusers often drank alcohol there. \nDuring 'training sessions' at the base, recruits were often forced to strip naked, while the trainers touched female soldiers in intimate areas without wearing any gloves and performed something they described as a “smell test.” Nicole E. said they often took pictures of the naked recruits for what they claimed were “training purposes.” Read more Numerous human rights abuses committed by students of US Pentagon schools \nThe victims’ accounts were largely confirmed, according to investigators who also found out that to protect themselves from any accusations, the abusers forced recruits to sign consent forms. \nIt also emerged that supervisors who were tasked with monitoring the training activities at the base regarded the situation as “absolutely normal,” and some reportedly even took part in the abuse. \nThe damning military report characterized the situation at the base as demonstrating “a grave lack of management, training, education and duty supervision.” Dealing with the problem would involve “wiping the slate clean” and working on a “radical mindset shift” of every member of the military personnel who had served at the base. \nHowever, five trainers, who were accused of abuses described by Nicole E, including a supervisor in the ranks of a major, were merely reassigned to other positions at the base or sent to other military facilities with some reportedly even being offered posts within an elite unit of the German Armed Forces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:52:33.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
