It's an exclusive club populated by the likes of Howard Stern, Charles Barkley and Chris Rock, and the Bennett boys fit right in. \nOn Wednesday, Michael Bennett was asked about running back Zach Zenner during a conference call with Detroit reporters ahead of Saturday's Wild Card matchup between the Lions and Seahawks . \n\"I think the running back, man, he's -- there's not many white running backs in the NFL but he has to be the best right now,\" Bennett said, according to the Detroit Free Press . \"He's doing such a great job of cutbacks and hitting the hole. He's a really good back. I know all the stuff he did in college, three straight seasons of 2,000 yards. I don't care where you're at, if you can do that you have got amazing talent. And I think he's just an amazing running back, the things he can do with the ball. He got good balance, he can spin, he can catch it out of the backfield. I think he fits the offense perfectly.\" \n\"That surprises me a lot because you don't see a lot of (white) running backs in the NFL, there's just a couple,\" Bennett continued. \"But he's right now, he's really, really good.\" \nZenner took no offense to Bennett's comment. \n\"That does not bother me, no,\" Zenner said, via the Detroit Free Press . \"Everyone's entitled to their opinion and it sounded like he said some pretty nice stuff.\" \nThis is the part of the post where I might be tempted to make a roster of White Guy All-Stars in the NFL. But I won't, because that's a terrible idea. I will say Zenner would be my starting tailback, and Bennett's right, there isn't a lot of competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T08:58:42.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
