Rec Photo by Craig Mercer - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images The latest update on the developing “not easy” situation of Chelsea’s supposed pursuit of Swansea City striker Fernando Llorente is that, well, it’s still developing. Is it developing more than yesterday? Maybe. Maybe not. It’s developing to some level, whatever level that may be, at least according to the people who claim to be in the know about things that are developing. #Chelsea talks ongoing for Fernando Llorente. Batshuayi can be part of the deal, possible loan to Swansea. Not easy. #transfers #CFC — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 6, 2017 The possible inclusion of Michy Batshuayi going the other way on loan is the new twist to tale, perhaps influenced by the identity of the new Swansea City boss, former Chelsea assistant Paul Clement. In a way, this arrangement does make sense, provided that Batshuayi gets first-team minutes from Clement as he attempts to rescue the Swans’ Premier League status. But is that something we could actually count on? Clement wouldn’t exactly be in a position to play for Chelsea’s long-term gain; his only concern is short-term survival. Of course, we could also be pursuing Llorente, provided we can even convince Swansea to sell, just to add another option to the squad, especially with pseudo-striker Ruben Loftus-Cheek linked with a loan exit and actual-striker Dominic Solanke not getting any playing (or lately, even training) time outside of the U23s. Either way, things could get a bit happier and possibly simpler in this situation if Batshuayi simply starts and impresses on Sunday.
