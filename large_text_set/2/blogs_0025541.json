Could   \nThe real woman behind Broadchurch ’s rape storyline has blasted Apple Tree Yard for the way it portrayed sexual assault. \nThe ITV drama’s third series started on TV last night with Trish - played by Julie Hesmondhalgh - reporting she’d been raped to the police. \nAnd rape victim Juliet Marsh helped Broadchurch make the story as realistic as possible. \nBut, speaking on This Morning, she compared the series to BBC’s recent drama Apple Tree Yard - which also focused around rape, with a shocking attack in the first episode.
