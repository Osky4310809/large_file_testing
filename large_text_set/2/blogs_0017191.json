(Photo by Graig Abel/Getty Images) \nWASHINGTON — Brooks Laich was placed on waivers Tuesday by the Toronto Maple Leafs, a year after being traded by the Capitals. \nAfter finishing out the final 21 games of the 2015-16 season with the Maple Leafs, Laich, now 33, has played 22 games this season with Toronto’s AHL affiliate, recording six points (one goal, five assists). \nLaich spoke intently about his future with the Maple Leafs over the weekend, telling The Athletic , “You don’t win a Stanley Cup playing in the American League. If the Leafs don’t have a plan for me with them then I would like to pursue a Stanley Cup somewhere else.” TOR puts Brooks Laich on waivers. \n— Bob McKenzie (@TSNBobMcKenzie) February 21, 2017 BTW, Laich is NOT on unconditional waivers (which permits mutually agreed termination of contract). Regular waivers in this instance. \n— Bob McKenzie (@TSNBobMcKenzie) February 21, 2017 Waivers not \"required\" for Laich. Him being put on comes on heels of attached comments. Available to any team now: https://t.co/jzam5FQBT8 \n— Bob McKenzie (@TSNBobMcKenzie) February 21, 2017 Serious question: what could Laich possibly offer a Cup-caliber club? https://t.co/g8GwEfz3aE \n— Neil Greenberg (@ngreenberg) February 21, 2017 \nLaich spent 12 years with the Capitals prior to last year’s trade. Though the Capitals are looking to secure their best possible lineup for the Stanley Cup Playoffs, it’s unclear with Laich’s waning production what he could offer at this point. \nFollow @ChrisLingebach and @1067TheFan on Twitter.
