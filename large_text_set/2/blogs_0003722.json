Hopefully, within the week, hopefully,” she added. \nA total of 60 people, including 44 police commandos of the Special Action Force (SAF), were killed in the firefight with Muslim rebels in Mamasapano, Maguindanao on Jan. 25, 2015. \nThe slain policemen were part of a SAF operation to capture Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Abdul Hir, alias Marwan, and bomb maker Basit Usman in a remote village in Mamasapano. \nMarwan was killed during the operation but Usman was able to escape. He died in an encounter with government forces four months later.   \nThe police operation went awry after the SAF commandos figured in a firefight with Muslim rebels on their way out of the area. \nLast month, Duterte said he would form a commission to investigate the Mamasapano incident as he admitted there are questions that remain unanswered. \nHe assured the public that the commission would be “independent in all aspects” and would consist of Supreme Court justices, civilians and a lawyer. \nThe President has also vowed to look into the possibility of awarding medals of valor to all the slain police commandos. \n“The highest honor that I can give really…the highest is to award them the Medal of Valor,” Duterte said during a dialogue with the families of the fallen SAF troopers in Malacañang last month. \n“Give me the result probably at the end of the month. The records are there. There is no need to investigate,” he added. \nOf the 44 slain SAF commandos, only Senior Insp. Gednat Tabdi and PO2 Romeo Cempron were awarded medals of valor.
