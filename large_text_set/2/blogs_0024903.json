'Anxious and nervous' \nThe FBI is investigating the incidents, but so far, no-one has claimed responsibility for the four separate waves of calls on 9, 18, 31 January and 20 February. \nJewish News Agency JTA has published what it says is a recording of one of the calls. In it, the caller makes an explicit threat to Jews, stating that a \"C-4 bomb with lots of shrapnel\" has been left. \nHowever, no explosives were found at any of the locations affected. \nThe telephone threats have sparked fear amongst parents and teachers across the county. \nMs Cohen Rosenfeld has held a number of one-on-one meetings with \"anxious and nervous\" parents, though most, she points out, were happy with how the school responded to the threats. \nJCC staff are tired of the \"disruption and anxiety\", says Mr Feinstein, who admits that it's always \"in the back of his mind.\" Media caption Gregory Locke: \"The entire car had been covered with Nazi symbolism and graffiti\" \nOn Jewish parenting websites and on social media, bloggers and columnists discuss how to respond to the threats. Some argue that parents should put their fears aside, while others feel more afraid. \n\"There was no bomb, and the children were never in any danger. But I still feel terrorized. I still feel vulnerable,\" wrote blogger Melissa Cohen. \nPaul Goldenberg, director of Secure Community Network, which advises Jewish groups and institutions on security, says this is part of a \"much bigger picture.\" \nIn addition to the bomb threats, Mr Goldenberg says there has been an increase in intimidation and harassment - with 170 incidents classed as anti-Semitic crimes being reported since the beginning of the year. \nMore than 170 headstones were damaged at a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis Missouri this week and sightings of swastikas and racist graffiti have been reported in a number of states. Image copyright AP Image caption The Chesed Shel Emeth cemetery in St Louis, Missouri, was vandalised on Monday \n\"The threats continue because whoever is responsible for these types of crimes really believes they can disrupt our way of life and it's not working.\" \nGoldenberg wants to make sure Jewish communities are \"prepared\" and know how to respond \"if people with bad intentions decide to attack.\" \nIn response to the bomb threat, the Bender JCC has decided to step up security measures. \nTeachers have started to do a sweep of their classrooms before classes begin, bags are being checked and security staff is ensuring all doors are locked except the front entrance. \nSo far, says Ms Cohen Rosenfeld, parents and teachers have continued to pretend the pre-schoolers were on a field trip that day, so they haven't had to explain the situation to the children. Image caption Ora Cohen Rosenfeld, Early Childhood Director at the Bender JCC, said the children thought they were going on a \"field trip.\" 'Different era' \nDespite the disruption to JCCs across the US, Mr Feinstein is reluctant to suggest the spate of bomb threats represents an overall rise in anti-Semitism. \n\"We are just living in just a different era,\" he says. \n\"It's too easy for people out there are who want to express their hatred and bigotry to do things on a grand scale.\" \nMs Cohen Rosenfeld agrees. \n\"I don't think that the change of the administration has made anti-Semitism worse here in the US. I think maybe it was a national conversation when it wasn't before.\" \n\"Anti-Semitism is something that we've always just lived with.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:06:07.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
