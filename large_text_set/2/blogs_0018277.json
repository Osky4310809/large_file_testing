This salad has just five ingredients—many of which are already layin’ around in your fridge—and requires a whopping two steps. Oven-roast your tomatoes until they bubble and slightly caramelize, then toss them with crunchy little gem lettuces, super-salty anchovies, parsley, whatever vinaigrette you happen to enjoy making or just have on hand, and, of course, a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper. \nBoom.
