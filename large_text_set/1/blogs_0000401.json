I love to work and I love football, but ultimately the demands of the job are no longer a good fit for me,\" Kubiak said in a statement Monday morning. \"I gave everything I had to this team the last two seasons, but this year, in particular, has been tough on me. As hard as it is to leave this position, I know that it's the best thing for myself, my family and the Denver Broncos .\" \nKubiak, 55, was diagnosed with a complex migraine condition earlier this season, which required hospitalization (he missed one game). He also suffered a mini-stroke back in 2013 as the head coach of the Houston Texans . \nKubiak went 82-75 in 10 seasons as a head coach, including 21-11 in two seasons with the Broncos . He won Super Bowl 50 as a head coach with the Broncos and three others -- XXIX, XXXII and XXXIII -- as an assistant. There have been only 7 head coaches to leave their team within 1 season of winning a Super Bowl title. pic.twitter.com/2inzXnJ809 â James Palmer (@JamesPalmerTV) January 2, 2017 \nKubiak has spent 22 seasons with the Broncos as a player, coach or assistant. \n\"I've been blessed to spend more than two decades with the Broncos working for Mr. Bowlen and a great organization from top to bottom,\" Kubiak said. \"I'm forever grateful to this team, in particular John Elway and Joe Ellis, for giving me the opportunity to serve as its head coach. There are countless others to thank, including players, coaches, personnel staff, trainers, support staff and fans. \n\"Although we fell short of our goals this year, I'm proud of our teams these past two seasons. Helping to bring Mr. Bowlen, his family and this organization its third Super Bowl is something that will always be very special to me.\" \nNowhere in the news release did Kubiak mention the word \"retire,\" instead he said he is stepping away from the every-day grind of the game for the moment. NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Sunday that Kubiak told the team of his plans to retire. \n\"I'm not sure what my future holds, but I know that I'll always consider myself a Bronco,\" Kubiak said. \"This team is in good hands with a lot of outstanding people, and I expect great things ahead for the Denver Broncos .\" \nRapoport reported that Dolphins defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and Falcons coordinator Kyle Shanahan -- son of ex-Denver coach Mike Shanahan -- are candidates to replace Kubiak.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T18:16:45.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
