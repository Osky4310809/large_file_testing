Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe Dimitri Payet saga is over after Marseille made his move away from West Ham official on Sunday night. \nPayet was shown in the Ligue 1's kit in a short video on the club's Twitter after a £25million deal was agreed with the Hammers. \n\"[Olympique Marseille] agree terms with West Ham to bring french international @dimpayet17 back to the club,\" the club said. \nThe fee, confirmed on Sunday by co-owner David Gold, for the playmaker could rise to around £30million with bonuses. \nPayet travelled to France on Sunday morning after he was given permission by the Hammers to complete his medical, which he duly passed. \nHe earlier took to Twitter to confirm he was homeward bound with a picture as he prepared to board a private jet. \nWest Ham made it clear that they wanted Payet - who has insisted his desire to leave is not about money - to prove as much by giving back a £1m bonus payment he was handed back in September. \nThe payment was made in October in a bid to appease Payet after he returned from his Euro2016 commitments with France unsettled and wanting to leave. \nIt is not yet known whether this payment was made and rather than wait for the morning to unveil the big money signing a smiling Payet was revealed on social media.

Boss Slaven Bilic went public on the row after Payet refused to budge on his stance. \nDefending the Frenchman’s, his camp are insistent that he only wants to leave for family reasons and that he is not motivated by finance.
