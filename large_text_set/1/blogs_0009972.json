BrewerFan.net’s Jim Goulart was first to tweet a connection between Feliz and the Brew Crew. \nThe 28-year-old Feliz is coming off a strong comeback season in the Pirates’ bullpen in which he posted a 3.52 ERA, 10.2 K/9 and 3.5 BB/9 over 53 2/3 innings. (He missed the last month of the season due to arm discomfort, but his injury was not structural in nature, as Tom Haudricourt of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel tweets . Feliz also began the year throwing his fastball in the mid-90s and added velocity as the season went on , a promising sign for a pitcher who had Tommy John surgery in 2012 and spent several seasons thereafter trying to get back on track. \nThe Brewers could represent a good match for Feliz. He has 99 saves’ worth of career closing experience, and in the wake of a variety of Brewers trades of established relievers (including Jeremy Jeffress and Tyler Thornburg ), he could receive the opportunity to close in Milwaukee. If he does, he could potentially receive a very lucrative contract the next time he’s a free agent. The rebuilding Brewers, meanwhile, would get the chance to dangle Feliz as a trade piece at the deadline, assuming they do fall out of the playoff race. The Brewers have reportedly been looking for relief pitching lately — GM David Stearns has said he’s exploring the possibility of adding relief help not only through big-league additions, but through minor-league signings and trades. The Dodgers had also been connected to Feliz of late.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:55:23.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
