Brothers Lyle andErik Menendez made national headlines for killing their sleeping parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in August 1989, and the crime is the focus of a new ABC special, airing on Thursday, January 5. PHOTOS: Most Infamous Family Murders in History \nThe program, entitled Truth and Lies: The Menendez Brothers, features an interview with Lyle, who has spent the past 26 years behind bars after he and Erik — who were 21 and 18, respectively, when their parents died — were convicted of first-degree murder in March 1996, and sentenced to two consecutive life-prison terms without parole. The conviction came in the case's second trial, after the first highly publicized one — which was broadcast on Court TV in 1993 — ended in a mistrial.

You are often defined by a few moments of your life, but that’s not who you are in your life, you know. Your life is your totality of it.… You can’t change it. You just — you’re stuck with the decisions you made.\" Lyle (left) and Erik Menendez leave the courtroom in Santa Monica on Aug. 6, 1990. AP Photo/Nick Ut \nLyle — who has married twice while in prison, including to second wife Rebecca Sneed in 2003 — says he is \"more at peace\" now than he was in the outside world.
