The veteran actor, best known for his most recent role as Owen Granger on NCIS: Los Angeles , passed away at his home after a battle with throat cancer. Ferrer continued working on NCIS up until his death, with the show's writers ultimately writing his illness into his character's storyline. Ferrer came from an acting family — he was the son of Oscar-winning actor Jose Ferrer and singer Rosemary Clooney and cousin to George Clooney. After the actor's death, his famous cousin remembered him with a poignant statement, saying, \"Miguel made the world brighter and funnier and his passing is felt so deeply in our family that events of the day, (monumental events), pale in comparison. We love you, Miguel. We always will.\" An accomplished drummer, Ferrer toured with his mother and Bing Crosby in the 1970s. But acting was Ferrer's forte, and his impressive TV career included roles on a long list of popular television shows over the past 30 years, including Crossing Jordan , Magnum, P.I., CHiPS, and Cagney & Lacey , as well as a very memorable guest role on Will & Grace . In 2017, Ferrer was ready to reprise his Twin Peaks role as FBI agent Albert Rosenfeld on Showtime's revival of the series.
