Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian     17.00 GMT Last modified on   17.02 GMT \nChas Hodges, one half of music duo Chas and Dave , has been diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus. \nAnnouncing the news in a Facebook post today, the statement said the 73-year-old will begin treatment immediately after the illness was fortunately spotted at an early stage. \nThe group have cancelled a number of dates as Hodges has treatment. “Chas expects to be back out on the road with Dave again soon, but in the meantime, the Potters Bar, Norwich, and Milton Keynes dates on the 17, 18, and 19 of February will need to be rescheduled,” reads the post.

The venues themselves will advise regarding re-scheduling/refunds etc.” \nThe London duo’s unique mix of rock and cockney – otherwise known as “rockney” – led to the pair rising to fame in the 1970s and 80s with hits including Rabbit and Snooker Loopy. \nBefore Hodges teamed up with Dave Peacock, he performed as a member of the Outlaws and backed bands such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Gene Vincent and Bill Haley in the late 50s and early 60s. He also played with Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, and appeared as special guest to the Beatles on their last British tour in 1966. \nAfter splitting temporarily in 2009 following the death of Peacock’s wife, Chas formed his own act called Chas and His Band before reforming with his bandmate a year later .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:33:11.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
