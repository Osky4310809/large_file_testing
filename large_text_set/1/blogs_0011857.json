Jan 13, 2017 6:35 PM 0 \nSubmitted by Jesse via Jesse's Cafe Americain blog, \n\"... there is another government concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue, a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose. \n\nMy analysis of this phenomenon is not an exposé of a secret, conspiratorial cabal; the state within a state is hiding mostly in plain sight, and its operators mainly act in the light of day. Nor can this other government be accurately termed an 'establishment.' \n\nAll complex societies have an establishment, a social network committed to its own enrichment and perpetuation. In terms of its scope, financial resources and sheer global reach, the American hybrid state, the Deep State, is in a class by itself. That said, it is neither omniscient nor invincible. The institution is not so much sinister (although it has highly sinister aspects) as it is relentlessly well entrenched. \n\nFar from being invincible, its failures, such as those in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, are routine enough that it is only the Deep State’s protectiveness towards its higher-ranking personnel that allows them to escape the consequences of their frequent ineptitude .\" \n\nMike Lofgren, Anatomy of the Deep State \nI do not think our time is all that different from those that have gone before it, insofar as the substance and types of our actions are concerned. Every age has its thieves and hypocrites, in high and low places. \nRather, what is a little more distinctive of us is the numbers, the sheer number of people whose character, or a lack thereof, fits a common pattern— mean, petty, deceitful, and often willfully ignorant of moral constraints, lacking in civility and grace, and utterly unrepentant of it. \nThey are quite proud of their cleverness in gaming the system, in embracing the worst aspects of the human economy and abusing them, in the name of their unnatural virtues. If they are liars, they strives to be among the most shameless and adept. If they are thieves, they admire those who steal tirelessly and the most, while paying no consequences. \nAnd above all, their perspective on life allows them to have no shame in it, any of it, in what other times would have been done in the darkness, and only behind closed doors, and carefully covered up. \nWe take our ill gotten gains, and place them in the spotlight with the high sounding names of wise-sounding and humanitarian organizations and foundations. \n* * * \n“There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.” \nSøren Kierkegaard", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:42:02.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
