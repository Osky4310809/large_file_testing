On Friday, Kensington Palace tweeted the news that Will and Kate are set to tour Germany and Poland in July (past royal tours have included the U.S., Canada, India, Australia, and New Zealand). A few weeks ago, the couple announced a two-day trip to Paris for the 20th anniversary of the death of William’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales , who died in a car crash in the city of lights. The Duke and Duchess will make an official visit to Poland and Germany this July at the request of The Foreign and Commonwealth Office. pic.twitter.com/zf4pPyD5g7 \n— Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 3, 2017 It’s unclear if son Prince George , 3, and daughter Princess Charlotte , 1, will accompany their parents to Germany and Poland, but the kids have experience mingling with diplomats: In 2016, they attended a garden party in British Columbia’s Government House where Charlotte innocently sat on a dog named Moose and George played with bubbles. And in 2014 during the royal tour to Australia and New Zealand, George visited a zoo , was gifted a wombat stuffed animal (that he used as a teething toy) and chewed on his mom’s hair during a group playdate . Neither Kate nor William have visited Poland before. But the duke traveled to Germany in August 2016, where fans reportedly waited for two hours in the “ blazing heat ” for his arrival and where William emphasized the “depth” of England’s alliance with Germany, in spite of Brexit . After the big trip, the royal family will move from their 10-bedroom Norfolk country home, Anmer Hall, to Kensington Palace’s apt 1A, where they’ve spent $6.5 million dollars remodeling its 30 rooms, including 9 bathrooms. In London, according to the latest issue of Us Weekly , Prince George will attend a new school and the duke and duchess are looking into local preschools for Princess Charlotte. The family is also strengthening its security team , planting conifer trees in an 820 foot-long wall around Kensington Palace for extra privacy. In their new home, William and Kate will undoubtedly spend more time with Prince Harry (and possibly girlfriend Meghan Markle ), who resides in the palace’s Nottingham Cottage. New digs, a vacation, and lots of family bonding — good times ahead!
