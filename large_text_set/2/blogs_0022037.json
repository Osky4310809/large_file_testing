Among those being considered for an increase are fines imposed on drivers who disregard zebra lanes or pedestrian crossings (currently pegged at P200) and those who fail to give way to other vehicles and pedestrians when making a U-turn or entering an adjacent road (P500). “We need to give more teeth to our traffic code by raising the fines for violations that directly endanger lives, especially of pedestrians who are most vulnerable to injury or death caused by accidents,” Binay said in a statement on Friday. Data from the Makati police showed that a total of 204 pedestrians were injured in accidents involving different types of vehicles in 2016. Of this number, 13 were hit-and-run victims, 117 were hit by four-wheel vehicles and 76 were hit by motorcycles. According to the city’s Public Safety Department, Makati has a total of 146 pedestrian lanes with traffic lights, 32 pedestrian lanes without traffic lights, 11 overpasses, seven underpasses, and 64 intersections.—DEXTER CABALZA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:01:41.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
