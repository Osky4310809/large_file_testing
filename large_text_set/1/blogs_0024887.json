His last Grand Slam came in 2012, almost 5 years ago which is unusual for a player of his calibre. \nOff the field, he had his problems as well. Federer missed half of the previous season due to injuries and was on the verge of missing the Australian Open. \nLadies and Gentlemen, the King has returned. #Federer clinches his 18th Grand Slam title def. Nadal 6-4 3-6 6-1 3-6 6-3. #AusOpen pic.twitter.com/KyJklc7vge \n— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 29, 2017 \nHowever, he recovered in time and enrolled himself into 2017’s first Grand Slam. Least did we know that he will go on to face one of his biggest rivals in the final, Rafael Nadal. \nAs it turned out, he emerged victorious and once again came to where he belongs, on top of the world. He re-established the fact that form is temporary but class is permanent.
