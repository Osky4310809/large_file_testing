This wasn’t just any neon-green jacket, though, as it was custom-made to honor Scalabrine and covered with pictures of his face. Tonight, a @Celtics fan showed up wearing a suit dedicated to @Scalabrine . \nWhite Mamba saw it & wore it during his broadcast… #goals ☘ pic.twitter.com/cQGGOOBLxT \n— Only In Boston (@OnlyInBOS) January 28, 2017 \nDespite the jacket being made in Scalabrine’s honor, it’s hilariously ironic that the fan misspelled the 11-year NBA veteran’s last name. Yeah. He's wearing that. pic.twitter.com/AChF8VgE8z \n— Marc D'Amico (@Marc_DAmico) January 28, 2017 \nIf you’re Scalabrine, you have to appreciate the love from the fans, even when they misprint your surname. \nThumbnail photo via Kyle Terada/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T07:50:21.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
