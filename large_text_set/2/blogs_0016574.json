Roughly 550 of those exoplanets could be rocky planets, like Earth, based on their size. Nine of these exoplanets orbit in their stars’ “Goldilocks Zones,” making them potentially habitable. \nSome exoplanets closely resemble Earth and are some of the best places to look for alien life. \nNASA scientists may have found another world similar to the “second Earth” discovered by European astronomers in August . \nEuropean astronomers found a slight “wobble” of gravity tugging on the star Proxima Centauri. Scientists don’t currently know if the planet, called “Proxima b,” has an atmosphere or possesses a magnetosphere, but there’s already a lot speculation about the possibility of life there. \nScientists consider Proxima b a good candidate for supporting life. Initial reports suggest Proxima b has a rocky surface, is close in size to Earth and circles its star closely enough to be relatively warm. Proxima b is likely in Proxima Centauri’s “Goldilocks Zone.” \nResearch suggests life on Proxima b, it would be subject to frequent planet-wide extinction events since it’s close in proximity to Proxima Centauri. \nIf life did develop on Proxima b, it may exist in a relatively primitive microbial form, NASA scientists previously told The Daily Caller News Foundation .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:34:24.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
