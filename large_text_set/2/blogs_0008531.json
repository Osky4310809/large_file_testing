I’m worried about the flooding. I’ve seen the pictures – that’s a lot of water.” \nA Red Cross spokeswoman said more than 500 people were at an evacuation center in Chico, California. The shelter had run out of blankets and cots, and a semi-tractor trailer with 1,000 more cots was stuck in the gridlock of traffic fleeing the potential flooding, said Red Cross shelter manager Pam Deditch. \nA California Highway Patrol spokesman said they would have two planes out Monday to help with traffic control as well as search and rescue.

Those potential flows could overwhelm the Feather River and other downstream waterways, channels and levees and flood towns in three counties. \nOroville Lake levels had decreased by Sunday night as they let water flow from its heavily damaged main spillway.

But Croyle said at that no repair work was done after officials looked at the flow and available resources. \nGov. Jerry Brown late Sunday issued an emergency order to fortify authorities’ response to the emergency at the dam and help with evacuations. \nAdjutant General David S. Baldwin of the California National Guard said at a news conference late Sunday that eight helicopters will be available Monday to assist with emergency spillway reconstruction.

Baldwin says an alert for the entire California National Guard hadn’t been issued since the 1992 riots. \nEarlier Sunday, officials stressed the Oroville Dam itself was structurally sound. \nUnexpected erosion chewed through the main spillway during heavy rain earlier this week, sending chunks of concrete flying and creating a 200-foot-long, 30-foot-deep hole that continues growing. Engineers don’t know what caused the cave-in, but Chris Orrock, a Department of Water Resources spokesman, said it appears the dam’s main spillway has stopped crumbling even though it’s being used for water releases. \nThe lake is a central piece of California’s government-run water delivery network, supplying water for agriculture in the Central Valley and residents and businesses in Southern California.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:32:57.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
