At the time of the filming, I was really happy [with my performance].” \nHowever, her happiness did not last long, as she opened up, “The next day, I read the news articles and there were a lot of negative responses. Because of that, for a long time, I was really intimidated whenever I went on a show.” \nWhat were your thoughts on her appearance on “Ask Us Anything”?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:04:19.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
