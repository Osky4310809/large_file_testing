JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ), Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC ), Bank of America Corp. ( BAC ), and Citigroup Inc. ( C ) reached their highest worth in comparison with China's four largest banks this month, reaching more than $250 billion ahead of their Chinese counterparts. The two groups of banks were worth about the same amount in June of 2016, according to ZeroHedge . What has caused the massive discrepancy? And what will happen next? Trump Driving Growth \nDonald Trump has been seen as a driver of growth in many financial areas since the election, largely due to his avowed plans to reduce regulations on corporations and to adjust the tax plan for businesses. As investors have been optimistic about Trump's promises, the U.S. stock market has enjoyed a substantial rally, and big players in the investment world have shifted their strategies in turn. It seems likely that Trump's presence has contributed to the growing market cap of these four U.S. banks. However, analysts have become less confident that Trump's rally can continue. So far, Trump has not revealed any of the plans for shifting regulations and taxes that were promised during the campaign season. While investors are generally willing to be patient, there are some signs that this patience could run out before too long , should nothing materialize. If that happens, it's likely that the changes to the general market as well as the market caps of banks like these will not remain stable. Chinese Precedent \nSkeptics may also point to the history of \" too big to fail \" banks in recent years as a sign of what could come in the future. The Great Recession of 2008 is a prime example of what can happen when financial institutions grow to an unsustainable size. Even more recently, in 2015, the largest banks in China experienced a similar problem. The parallels to the current situation are uncanny: in June of 2015, the four largest Chinese banks achieved a market cap of over $1 trillion. That same month, the Chinese stock market bubble burst, sending the country's financial world (and, to a certain extent, the global financial system) into a period of turbulence that lasted for months. While the exact nature of a bubble and the process of a burst and subsequent crash is complicated and occurs as a result of a variety of factors, the fact that Chinese banks were \"too big to fail\" seems to have played an important part in that scenario. Investors in the U.S. are wise to look to historical precedent when examining the newest data about the market cap of the country's largest banks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:23:45.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
