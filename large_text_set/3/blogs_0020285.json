Luis Enrique turned up in 2014, pitched it on high ground and it has held firm through the storms, the blizzards and the bluster. \nSafely housed inside it now is a treble (2014-15), a double (2015-16) and a lotto ticket for another shot at the treble—rescued from the gutter by that seismic 6-1 victory over PSG at Camp Nou in the Champions League. \nBut the Asturian coach has tired of camping and is taking his pegs with him, whether or not he hits the jackpot in June. Barcelona’s job this summer is to stop the canvas from being blown away by the winds of change. \nBecause the tent has served Barcelona well. Stitched together by Pep Guardiola, the fabric of the team remains the same. Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Gerard Pique and, of course, Lionel Messi, compose the spine that has brought a decade of wild success. \nThe Catalans wanted Luis Enrique to stay, at least until the 4-0 humiliation in Paris by PSG, and have no immediate plan B now that he is departing, although his replacement may be close at hand.

He is with us every day,” said Iniesta. \nPique added: \"He's spent many years here, since Guardiola's spell in charge and before that as a player. I'm sure he would be a good candidate.” \nAnd Ivan Rakitic chipped in: “We have complete confidence in him.” \nUnzue himself threw his hat in the ring on Monday. Speaking at the Tour of Catalonia cycling race, he was asked if he was looking forward to cycling more himself when Luis Enrique leaves Barcelona. \n“I hope I don’t have any spare time next year,” he replied.
