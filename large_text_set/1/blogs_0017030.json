That was a tiny fraction of the 1,400 employees who donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign, for a total of $1.6 million. \nAnd it wasn't just political donations. \nThe revolving door between the Obama administration and the company swung hard and frequently during the past eight years: 22 former White House officials left the administration to work for Alphabet, according to research from the Campaign for Accountability. \nAlphabet's support for Clinton was evident in its C-suite as well. \nWikiLeaks revealed that Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt emailed John Podesta — Clinton's campaign manager — volunteering to fund, advise and recruit talent for her White House run. CFO Ruth Porat donated $2,700 to Clinton, the maximum amount of money an individual can contribute to a federal campaign. \nLike many tech companies, Alphabet has a range of potential political issues that it must consider, from immigration to privacy, taxes to encryption. There are also regulatory concerns. \nIn Europe, it is under fierce antitrust scrutiny. To date, the U.S. has been safer ground though CNBC reported last summer that officials from the Federal Trade Commission had deepened their analysis of the company's practices at home.

It remains an open question how the Trump administration will approach these sensitive issues. \nFor his part, Trump took tough, unverified shots at the iconic company on the campaign trail. For example, he accused Google of manipulating search results to favor his Democratic rival. \nDespite this rocky history, both sides are now trying to find common ground as the inauguration approaches. Alphabet CEO Larry Page recently joined other tech leaders at a meeting with the incoming president. Meanwhile, Schmidt has been very visible at Trump Tower, visiting at least twice. \nStuart Roy, a veteran political strategist who used to represent the company in Washington, said that kind of outreach makes sense. \n\"It is clear that Trump values personal relationships much more than holding a vindictive grudge,\" says Roy, who is now president of the communications firm Strategic Action Public Affairs. \"Google is clearly not starting from a strong position, but I do think there is a way they can build that relationship and build that trust.\" \nWhile its relationship with the new administration is uncertain, Alphabet does have plenty of conservative friends on Capitol Hill. \nIts top lobbyist is Susan Molinari, the former Republican congresswoman from New York. Last year, the company's political action committee donated $1.5 million to federal candidates, with 56 percent directed to Republicans. \nAlphabet declined comment for this story.
