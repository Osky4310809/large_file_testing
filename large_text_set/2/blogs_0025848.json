I don’t think it’s too late. \nDavid Moyes’ former Everton and Manchester United army at Sunderland Monday, 30th January 2017 SUNDERLAND boss David Moyes has brought in yet more of his ex-Everton and Manchester United players. 1 / 11 David Moyes’ former Everton and Manchester United army at Sunderland “I’ve got to believe it’s going to happen” Sunderland boss David Moyes \n“We’ve got a tough run - the next game is Man City so I’m not kidding myself. We’re in a couple of games where we just have to stick with it. \n“But I think Sunderland have been in a lower state than this and come from behind. I still believe there’s a run. \n“The way football works sometimes is that you never see it coming. So I’ve got to believe it’s going to happen.” \nMoyes had a clear plan of which games he had a chance of winning when he saved Everton from the drop in 2002. \nHe has a similar road map of how to navigate Sunderland out of trouble and insists a visit to Goodison was not a game he was expecting to get anything from. \nBut it could have been at least in the bag had a bit of luck gone their way. \nIdrissa Gueye put Everton ahead five minutes before half-time when he lashed home from Seamus Coleman’s cut back for his first goal for the club. \nJermain Defoe smashed a shot off the underside of the bar in the 78th minute and 120 seconds later Romelu Lukaku broke away before finding the net via a deflection off former Toffee Bryan Oviedo to kill the game. \n“We are lacking quality at times that I hope would give us a chance or a goal,” Moyes added.
