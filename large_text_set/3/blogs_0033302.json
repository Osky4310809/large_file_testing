The actor lost his cool on a flight and, allegedly, beat up his crew members, especially Sunil Grover . \nHe later apologised (sort of) for his delinquency, but his team wasn't ready to listen this time. Rumour has it that apart from Sunil, Ali Asgar, and Chandan Prabhakar have also quit the show. The host himself is not in town and the shooting seems to be on a standstill since the last two weeks. \nSpeaking to Tellychakkar, the crew claims that the show's creative director, Preeti Simoes, has also quit the show. She has also deleted her Twitter account in order to distance herself from this drama. \"Preeti has taken a break from the show and we have no clue if she is coming back. Even her sister Neeti is no more working for us. It's a hard time for the team as, apart from artists, we do not even have a creative director. It's been two weeks, and we are only hoping that things get sorted soon,\" said the source. \nRumour also suggests that Preeti is miffed by claims that she leaked details about the Kapil-Sunil fight to the media. When contacted (by Tellychakkar) she said, \"I am currently holidaying; let's connect when I am back. I have not quit the show, just on a break\". \nWow, this is classic Indian television drama!
