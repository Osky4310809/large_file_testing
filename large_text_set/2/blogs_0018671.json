Britains top curry restaurants \nD espite two curry restaurants closing each week, the dining out sector as a whole is thriving with sales and new openings on the increase, said Mr Khan. \nThe ACF represents more than 35,000 ethnic restaurants and takeaways in Britain - including those in the Indian, Chinese, Thai and Malaysian community, but the largest single group are Bangladeshi. \nApproximately nine in 10 curry restaurants in the UK are Bangladeshi owned. \nMr Khan said: \"British Bangladeshis can be very insular and inward looking. We fail to regard other cuisines as competition and we are slow to adopt new marketing opportunities, such as social media platforms.\" Watch | Goan prawn curry with coconut, chilli and coriander 02:52 \nH e admitted his message \"won't go down well with many of my members, who continue to fail to heed warnings and take responsibility for the survival of their businesses.\" \nThe ACF organises the annual Asian Curry Awards to recognise the best in the industry, encouraging higher standards and inspiring the next generation of chefs. It also runs a nationwide roadshow, teaching members about changing eating trends and key industry issues like health, nutrition and hygiene. \nMr Khan said: \"For years we have been telling restaurants they need to up their game with shorter menus, offering lighter healthier options with more fish and vegetable dishes, with genuinely authentic regional food.

Where's the darjeeling, assam, dooar, and travancore?\" \nH e was backed by Thomas Chan, head of the Chinese Takeaway Association, who said: \"The best run restaurants will survive and thrive - the less well run will be replaced by a new wave of more innovative operators.\" \nTeddy Chen, of the Malaysian Restaurant Association, added: \"It will be sad to lose some old favourites, but there some exciting and dynamic restaurateurs waiting in the wings to take their place. \nThe 7th Asian Curry Awards will take place at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London on November 12.
