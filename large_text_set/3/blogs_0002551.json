However, what is even more abhorrent is the manner in which Union ministers are in an overdrive, trying to justify both the violence and viciousness. It is ironic that the finance minister while speaking at the London School of Economics and Political Science, an institution with a global reputation for both critical inquiry and unrelenting critique, sought to rubbish the Indian academia by claiming that there is an “alliance of subversion” across university campuses in India.\nHis colleague, the minister of information and broadcasting, has been tilting at windmills in a manner that would make even Don Quixote turn in his grave. However, most repugnant has been the conduct of my friend, the junior minister of home affairs, who has chosen to intimidate a young student who has the conviction of courage to stand up to ideological vehemence unleashed by the quintessential forces of right reaction and national subversion.\nWhat the FM perhaps forgot or, maybe, was oblivious off that he was speaking in a country that had upheld its right to free speech at even the gravest times of national peril. Its Parliament functioned throughout the World War–II, its media was not gagged while a bipartisan war Cabinet strove to surmount the Nazi-Fascist-Imperial Axis.\nPerhaps the finance minister was selectively amnesic of the fact that not very far away from where he was speaking, on February 9, 1933, the Oxford Union, the undergraduate-debating society of Oxford University, passed a notorious motion that “This House would not in any circumstances fight for King and Country”. It was carried by 275 votes to 153.\nThough Winston Churchill termed the vote as “abject, squalid, shameless” and “nauseating”, and it was even speculated that it misled the German Dictator Adolf Hitler into hallucinating that Britain had lost the resolve to fight, but nobody and much less the British government charged the students with sedition.\nThe vote certainly did not reflect either the will or the mood of the British people.Oxford undergraduates were young people, who often like to take stances or a controversial position precisely because they recognise that it will provoke a robust reaction — as the Oxford vote indubitably did.\nWhen war finally came in 1939, many of those who had taken part in the debate and voted for the motion did indeed fight — and die — for King and Country. Does the Indian finance minister believe that the then British government erred and all those recalcitrants who voted for the motion should have been locked up under the law on sedition — that Britain in any case was freely using in India to chill the freedom of speech and expression.Yes, the British can be accused of double standards, but isn’t that the case with all occupying powers?\nHowever, what the finance minister’s remarks and the information and broadcasting minister’s verbosity do reflect is a ‘deep seated’ paranoia that an instinctive “alliance of subversion” is indeed crystalising across university campuses, and this alliance of progressive, pluralistic and nationalistic forces is predicated on undermining the governance paradigm of the current BJP-led NDA government.\nThe spurious debate on nationalism that the government and its fellow travellers keep periodically provoking is nothing but a pathetic attempt to deflect attention from their administrative and governance failures. One can only laugh at these attempts because it goads a very basic question — was the whole of India anti-national before PM Narendra Modi and his not-somerry men assumed office? Why such a debased debate did not defile the hallowed portals of our democratic edifice earlier? The answer is very simple because no sanguine people and no self-assured nation need to wear its patriotism on its sleeve. For as Samuel Johnson articulated as far back as April 7, 1775: Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.\nEven on Kashmir the manner in which an alternative viewpoint articulated by none other than the former home and finance minister is sought to be savaged is a telling reflection on how the current dispensation believes in lynching the messenger. The situation in the valley is like a tinderbox. The next flash of the matchbox may send it over the precipice, perhaps irretrievably.\nThe seriousness of the situation has been underscored by none other than an independent panel of citizens led by the venerable Yashwant Sinha — the former finance and foreign minister in the Vajpayee government.\nAs a distinguished editor very aptly put it that if any individual can qualify to fit the definition of the term ‘deep state’ then certainly Chidambram fits the bill in entirety.\nIf two separate avatars of the deep state, P Chidambram and Yashwant Sinha, are saying the same thing, the government would be loath to dismiss their concerns at its own peril.\nHowever, at the very heart of the lumpenism and vandalism perpetrated by the ABVP in Ramjas College lies a fundamental question. Does the right to freedom of speech and expression include the right to offend? And it certainly does, then while the offended including the state can invoke remedies available under the law if reasonable restrictions prescribed in Article 19(2) of the Constitution are transgressed, does the alleged offender have protection from state-sponsored intimidation, violence and coercion —especially the Bhakts, perverts and trolls variety — while the law takes its own course. That is the question civil society must ponder over?\n(The author is Former Union Information And Broadcasting Minister)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:17:17.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
