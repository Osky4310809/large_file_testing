LIVERPOOL INTERESTED IN WERNER \nLiverpool are keeping close tabs on young RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner, according to the Daily Mail . \nThe 21-year-old has made a big impact since signing from Stuttgart, and those efforts have not gone unnoticed with Jurgen Klopp impressed with his performances in the Bundesliga.
