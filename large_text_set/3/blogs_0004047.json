Earlier, this aerobatic team operated Su-27 and Su-27UB fighters, since being established in 1991.

Currently, we are in the process of mastering this fighter. There will be many new elements with the use of supermaneuverability in the individual aerobatics. We will also add something new to the group aerobatics,\" Colonel Alekseyev says. \nHe also says that the combat capabilities of the Su-30SM are much better than those of previous generation fighters. Unlike most other aerobatic teams in the world, the Russian Knights fly serial aircraft completely retaining their combat capabilities. \nSu-30SM epitomizes the further development of Su-30MKI fighters operated by the Indian Air Force and Su-30MKM fighters operated by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. Large batches of Su-30SM fighters acquire the Russian Aerospace Forces and the Naval Aviation of the Russian Navy. \nAt the LIMA'17 exhibition in Malaysia, the Russian Knights will fly four Su-30SM aircraft. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T10:54:35.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
