The premiere of Salata's second location on Thursday in The Woodlands allows patrons to do just that. \nThe salad franchise serves fresh ingredients that are hand-made daily, with gluten-free dressings, soups and sauces. Patrons order through an assembly-line process where they can choose from wraps, salads, soups, bread, pasta, pita chips and desserts. \nWhile the health-conscious restaurant has been in the soft-opening phase for roughly a week, the grand opening on Thursday will donate 10 percent of the daily proceeds to benefit March of Dimes , an international campaign raising funds for research and treatment of premature babies. \nWoodlands Salata franchisee Amy Qualley and her husband bought the Market Street Salata location in 2011. The Qualley's plan to open a third location within a year, hopefully off Woodlands Parkway and Kuykendahl Road. \nShortly after purchasing the Market Street Salata, the Qualley's began partnering with The Woodlands Preemies, a fundraising group for March of Dimes, by donating time and food to the group's annual event, Bingo for Babies. \nQualley said she has a personal connection with March of Dimes, because she and her husband lost their baby when Qualley was roughly eight-and-a-half months pregnant. While this was years ago, when Ashley Williams of The Woodlands Preemies asked for help, the Qualley's knew they wanted to partner with the community in whatever way they could. \nWilliams, whose twins were born premature at 25-weeks, is a team captain for The Woodlands Preemies. The group is made of mothers and families in Montgomery County who have been affected by prematurity in some way; they've raised over $34,000 for March of Dimes in the two years they have participated. \nAccording to marchofdimes.org, of the 15 million babies that are born prematurely yearly around the world, 1 million of those will not survive. The average medical cost of a premature baby is also considerably more expensive than that of a healthy baby, roughly $54,000 compared to $4,300. \nWith The Woodlands Preemies' partnership with Salata, Williams said she hopes the grand opening day will raise thousands of dollars for March of Dimes. \n\"Babies don't have a voice when they're born this premature and sick, so they need us in the community to fight for them,\" Williams said. \"Every donation is so important, because it goes toward the research and therapies these children need to have a healthy life.\" \nThe newest Salata opens Thursday, March 23 at 3091 College Park Drive, Suite 290 in The Woodlands. Doors open at 11 a.m. and the first 50 dine-in customers will eat for free. For those who can't be the first 50, t-shirts, tumblers and coupons will be dispersed while supplies last. \nNormal hours of operation will be 11a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday thru Saturday and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday.
