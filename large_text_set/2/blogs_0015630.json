Groovy, baby! \nThe Hurricanes took the No. 18 Cavaliers to the brink on the road, sending it to overtime before closing it out in in extra time, 54-48. \nThe game was anything but an offensive shootout. Virginia shot just 31 percent from the floor, while Miami was only marginally better at 37 percent. So we know he wasn’t dancing about his team’s offense. \nBut this is a crucial win for the Hurricanes, and Larrañaga knew it. \nMiami still has some work to do to secure an NCAA Tournament bid. With three tough games left -- against Duke , Virginia Tech and Florida State -- this emotional win could springboard the Hurricanes toward the Big Dance.
