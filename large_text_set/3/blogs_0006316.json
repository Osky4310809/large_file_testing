This week, the company quietly confirmed that it has expanded the reach of Google Store product shopping to include people who are buying devices from other countries.\nSee also: Google Home confirmed for UK launch in Q2 2017 1 week ago Before you get too excited, here’s how this feature works. You can purchase devices on the US Google Store from another country, but that device still can only be shipped to a US-based address. Thus, you cannot use this feature to buy a Google Home speaker, which is currently only available in the US, and have it shipped to your home in Canada. However, if you live in Canada, and you have family or friends who live in the US, you can now go to the US Google Store site, purchase that Home speaker with your credit or debit card, and send it over to them.\nTechnically, this new feature will also work if you have a forwarding address in the US. That way, you can then have any US-based product shipped to you after it’s sent to that location. You can get started using this small but helpful feature by going to the country picker page on the Google Store site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T20:45:33.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
