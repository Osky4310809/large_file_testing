Meanwhile, with a win tonight, the Wild can push their conference lead to a very comfortable nine points while moving ahead of the Washington Capitals for the top spot in the NHL. Wild Head Coach Bruce Boudreau is less concerned about the overall points lead and more concerned about staying ahead of Chicago. \n\"It's going to be a good one,\" Boudreau said following his team's practice on Monday. \"We're playing Chicago, the team that's trying to catch us. Anything less than playing your hardest will not be successful.\" \nThe Wild have notched a point in nine-straight games against Chicago, going 8-0-1 over that stretch and, with a point Tuesday night, can match their franchise-best 10-game point streak against a single opponent (done twice versus Edmonton and Arizona). \nRiding high after a 5-2 win over the Nashville Predators on Saturday, Minnesota could receive even more good news with the potential return of defenseman Matt Dumba who has been out since February 12 with a lower body injury. \nBoudreau spoke with KFAN's Paul Allen on Tuesday morning regarding Dumba's potential return and, when asked if the 22-year old would be back in the lineup, Boudreau said simply, \"Maybe.\" \nMinnesota will aim to win their third -straight game when the puck drops tonight at 7:08 P.M. CST. The game can be heard on KFAN 100.3 FM. Contact ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:50:50.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
