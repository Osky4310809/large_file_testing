Mr Shi linked the dispute to Singapore’s trade and defence relations with Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, and its position on Chinese claims in the South China Sea . \nOn Monday Ng Eng Hen, Singapore’s defence minister, told parliament the Terrex armoured vehicles were “protected by sovereign immunity” and “cannot legally be detained or confiscated by other countries”. \nThis elicited a harsh response from China: “I hope the relevant parties can be cautious in their remarks and actions,” said Lu Kang, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \nFor years Singapore has maintained a quiet relationship with Taipei , despite objections from Beijing. Taiwan has allowed Singapore to hold military manoeuvres there every year since the 1970s. Singapore also signed a trade deal with Taiwan in 2013.

But in the foreground it is about the increasing assertiveness of China in the East Asian region.” \nBusiness figures in Singapore hoped the tensions would pass, he said. “The China market is still good. Businessmen are looking for political stability. They hope the political spat will be resolved soon.” \nBeijing’s anger at Singapore-Taipei ties came to a head in November when the armoured vehicles were impounded in Hong Kong while on their way back from military exercises in Taiwan. \nHong Kong has given no formal reasons for the seizure, although initial reports suggested a documentation problem. “The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will handle it in accordance with our laws,” said the office of the territory’s chief executive, which answers to Beijing on matters of defence and foreign affairs. \nMost analysts believe Hong Kong seized the vehicles at the behest of Beijing, which will use them to wring concessions out of Singapore. Live event: Year of the Rooster \nJoin FT commentators in London on January 24 to discuss the key risks and opportunities facing China in 2017. \nThat impression was strengthened on Monday when Mr Lu of the Chinese foreign ministry appeared to link a resolution to the condition that Singapore give precedence to its relationship with Beijing at the expense of Taipei. \n“Firstly, I want to stress that we hope every country including Singapore conscientiously complies with the one-China policy ,” he said. “This is the basic premise for China and other countries to develop relationships.” \nAn effect of the policy is that countries must choose between formal diplomatic ties with Beijing or Taipei. Singapore established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1990. \nThe statement is part of a pattern of more assertive Chinese behaviour throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Singapore’s relations with Beijing have deteriorated because of China’s increasingly aggressive stance on South China Sea territorial disputes over the past year, driving Singapore closer to the US. Washington has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over Chinese claims in the region. \nSingapore’s prime minister last year expressed support for a ruling by an international arbitration tribunal in The Hague against Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea. \nAdditional reporting by Sherry Fei Ju Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.
