The tower was located in Shinar, in ancient Mesopotamia on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. \nBible scholars believe that the tower was a type of stepped pyramid called a ziggurat , common throughout Babylonia. \nUp until this point in the Bible, the whole world had one language, meaning one common speech for all people. The people of the earth had become skilled in construction and decided to build a city with a tower that would reach to heaven. By building the tower, they wanted to make a name for themselves and also prevent the people from being scattered. \nGod came to see their city and the tower they were building. He perceived their intentions, and in his infinite wisdom, he knew this \"stairway to heaven\" would only lead the people away from God. \nGod observed what a powerful force their unity of purpose created. As a result, he confused their language, causing them to speak many different languages so they would not understand each other. By doing this, God thwarted their plans. He also scattered the people of the city all over the face of the earth. Lessons From the Tower of Babel Story \nThe tower of Babel story emphasizes the sharp contrast between man's opinion of his own achievements and Godâ€™s point of view on these accomplishments. The tower is a grandiose project--the ultimate man-made achievement. It resembles the modern masterstrokes humans continue to build and boast about today, such as the International Space Station . \nTo build, the people used brick instead of stone and tar instead of mortar. They used \"man-made\" materials, instead of more durable \"God-made\" materials. The people were building a monument to themselves, to call attention to their abilities and achievements, instead of giving glory to God. \nGod says in Genesis 11:6, \"If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.\" (NIV) With this, God points out that when people are unified in purpose, they can accomplish impossible feats, both noble and ignoble. This is why unity in the body of Christ is so important in our efforts to accomplish God's purposes on earth. \nBy contrast, a unity of purpose in worldly matters, ultimately, can be destructive. In God's viewpoint, division in worldly matters is sometimes preferred over great feats of idolatry and apostasy. For this reason, God at times intervenes with a divisive hand in human affairs. To prevent further arrogance, God confuses and divides people's plans, so they don't overstep God's limits on them. Points of Interest From the Story When God speaks in this story, He uses the phrase, \"let us go,\" referencing the Trinity . Some scholars believe that this marks the point in history where God divided the earth into separate continents. Question for Reflection \nAre there any man-made towers you are building in your life? If so, stop and reflect. Are your purposes noble or ignoble?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:16:45.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
