On Thursday night, Barack and Michelle went to Carbone with their daughter Malia , and on Friday, the former first family dined with Bono at Upland for lunch . They’ve been to the restaurants multiple occasions in the past, visits that added to the family’s stellar track record of dining at the city’s best hotspots . \nAccording to the Daily Mail , Barack ordered red wine and the double lamb chop at Carbone, while Michelle had white wine and Malia drank water. Barack previously went to Major Food Group’s upscale Italian restaurant in 2013 and again in 2015 for veal parm and porterhouse for two . The Major Food Group restaurant is notoriously difficult to get into, but presumably, it is easier if you are Barack Obama.\nThen Friday at lunch, a very chilled out looking Michelle and Barack met up with U2 singer Bono and his daughter Jordan at Upland, the acclaimed restaurant from Stephen Starr and chef Justin Smillie . They dined in the private dining room downstairs. No word on what they ate, but when Barack took his daughters to Upland for brunch in 2015 , he ordered the California-esque burger .\n#powerlunch w/ @karanilanraymond & @lindseybono & @michelleobama & #presidentobama #nyc #upland \nA post shared by Emma Wiedner (@ewiedner) on Mar 10, 2017 at 11:32am PST \nI'm dying. I'm dead. PRESIDENT OBAMA is at lunch w us. We all clapped and cried. \nA post shared by Mackenzi (@mackenzi) on Mar 10, 2017 at 11:19am PST \nStopped into Upland to have a burger with my parents and the Obamas were dinning there! #mypresident #potus #nyc \nA post shared by Patrick Bishop (@patrickbbishop) on Mar 10, 2017 at 2:55pm PST \nPeople basically freaked out over seeing the Obamas out and about, applauding as Barack and Michelle exited Upland on Friday. Onlookers did the same thing when Barack took Malia to Emilio’s Ballato and Gramercy Tavern a couple weeks ago . \nMalia is in town for an internship with the Weinstein Company, so it’s possible that New York’s finest dining establishments will be seeing more of the family as time goes on. Michelle will reportedly be here all weekend .
