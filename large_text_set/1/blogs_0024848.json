Architecture firm FRANTZEN et al architecten designed Patch22 with multifunctionality in mind– the team anticipated different future uses so that the building can accommodate housing units or office spaces, depending on circumstances.\n\n\nThe building, located in Amsterdam, features a 98-feet high wooden load-bearing structure with wooden columns , beams and walls left exposed in the interior. It meets all the fire regulations and allows occupants to easily reach and reinstall their own installations and pipes depending on the chosen layout. Thanks to a high level of flexibility, Patch22 can be easily transformed from a residential project into an office building. The building generates its own energy thanks to solar panels installed on its roof. A carbon-neutral heating system uses pellets as fuel to keep the entire building warm.\n\nRelated: PLP Architecture unveils the design for London’s first timber tower \nPatch22 is the brainchild of FRANTZEN et al architects and H20 installation consultancy who jointly established Lemniskade Projects to realize the project which won the Sustainability Tender Amsterdam Buiksloterham in 2009. The team has recently acquired a neighboring plot to develop a new project named Top-Up, which will also include an extensive use of wood . While waiting for the new project to break ground next summer, the designers of Patch22 are receiving recognition from the professional community. Patch22 was awarded both the WAN 2016 Residential Award and Green Award.\n+ FRANTZEN et al architecten \nVia v2com \nPhotos by Luuk Kramer \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T08:01:18.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
