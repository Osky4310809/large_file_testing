That is just us living And to truly live You must first truly believe. \nThis oath is a projection and after much time in reflection I choose to embrace what I see, And manifest destiny. \nNo more fear from the pain, I no longer feel those questions need to be named I walk the line and refine going forward, Maintaining courage, for these answers to be framed. \nWe are picture perfect With a rich wealth and knowledge of self That shows weâ€™re worth it. \nI will write the words to be read in A syncopated rhythm when exhaled from the lung As love is the truest breath inhaled For the soul to become one. \n~", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:18:44.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
