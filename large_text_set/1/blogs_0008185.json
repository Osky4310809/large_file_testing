Durkin | 11:28 am, January 11th, 2017 video \nIn his first press conference in 167, President-elect Donald Trump used his opening remarks to criticize the two news organizations — CNN and BuzzFeed — who reported on stories Tuesday about Trump’s ties to the Russian Federation. \nWhile the CNN report simply indicated that the PEOTUS had received classified briefings that suggested the Kremlin has potentially “compromising” information about Trump, BuzzFeed controversially released the full incriminating — an unsubstantiated — 35-page dossier. \nWhile Trump slammed these media outlets, in a noteworthy turn of events he actually thanked others who refrained from running the unverified story. “They looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies — who knows? but maybe the intelligence agencies — which would be a tremendous blot on their record if that in fact did that. A tremendous blot on their record, because a thing like that should never have been written.” \nWatch above via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T18:37:56.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
