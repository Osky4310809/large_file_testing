Last night’s performance in Hobart, Australia, marked their first show since Cave’s son Arthur tragically died in July 2015 , an event that weighs heavily on the new album. We’ve collected videos of the band performing tracks from the album; watch them below.\n“Girl in Amber”: \n\n“I Need You”: \n\n“Magneto”: \n\n“Skeleton Tree”: \n\nCave also granted his first interview since his son’s death to The Australian (via NME ), talking about the making of Skeleton Tree . “For me, going into the studio in Paris was not a good idea, and I hope I never have to do anything like that again,” he said. “It was only a few months after Arthur died. It was too early. But it just felt important that I do it. You know, life goes on and all. It was crazy. Terrifying, really.”\nHe also talked about the fan reaction to the album’s companion film, One More Time With Feeling , and how it helped him move on: “You know, I saw the things people wrote about the film on social media … the way the film seemed to open something very deep for people, and how so many people out there had lost people they loved, you know, just how many grievers there were. It was a very powerful feeling, and ultimately shifted something in me, and Susie too, and stopped us feeling so completely hopeless all the time. It was like we had done something good for Arthur, all of us, and had placed the memory of him up there in the stars.”\nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds 2017 Tour Dates: \n01/15 – Ballarat, AU @ North Gardens\n01/17 – Wellington, NZ @ TSB Bank Arena\n01/18 – Auckland, NZ @ Vector Arena\n01/20 – Sydney, AU @ ICC Sydney Theatre\n01/21 – Sydney, AU @ ICC Sydney Theatre\n01/22 – Newcastle, AU @ Newcastle Entertainment Centre\n01/25 – Brisbane, AU @ Riverstage\n01/27 – Melbourne, AU @ Sidney Myer Music Bowl\n01/28 – Melbourne, AU @ Sidney Myer Music Bowl\n01/29 – Adelaide, AU @ Adelaide Entertainment Centre\n01/31 – Perth, AU @ Perth Arena\n05/26 – Brooklyn, NY @ Kings Theatre\n05/27 – Brooklyn, NY @ Kings Theatre\n05/29 – Montreal, QC @ Metropolis\n05/31 – Toronto, ON @ Massey Hall\n06/01 – Toronto, ON @ Massey Hall\n06/03 – Detroit, MI @ Masonic Temple Theatre\n06/05 – Philadelphia, PA @ Electric Factory\n06/07 – Asheville, NC @ Thomas Wolfe Auditorium\n06/08 – Pittsburgh, PA @ The Warhol at Carnegie Music Hall\n06/10 – Boston, MA @ Boch Center Wang Theatre\n06/13 – New York, NY @ Beacon Theatre\n06/14 – New York, NY @ Beacon Theatre\n06/16 – Chicago, IL @ Auditorium Theatre\n06/18 – Denver, CO @ Paramount Theatre\n06/19 – Salt Lake City, UT @ Kingsbury Hall\n06/21 – Portland, OR @ Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall\n06/22 – Vancouver, BC @ Queen Elizabeth Theatre\n06/24 – Berkeley, CA @ Greek Theatre\n06/26 – San Diego, CA @ Civic Theatre\n06/29 – Los Angeles, CA @ Greek Theatre", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T03:20:17.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
