While the rehabilitation of displaced Tamils is still a contentious issue, Rajinikanth’s visit to Jaffna is likely to attract a huge crowd as he is also expected to speak at a public meeting in Jaffna. \nThe foundation, which has been named after Lyca Group chairman Subaskaran Allirajah’s mother, has constructed these homes at a cost of ₹22 crore. The foundation has been working extensively in the northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka to rebuild schools that were destroyed in the civil war in 2009. When asked about the project, Raju Mahalingam, creative head, Lyca Productions, said that the entire project has been completed in a period of one-and-a-half years. “ After MGR, no mass hero of that stature has visited and spoken in Jaffna,” he added. These homes have been built in Chinna Tampan and Puliyankulam regions in northern Sri Lanka. \nOn April 10, Rajinikanth will be in Vavuniya to unveil the new homes and he will also plant tree saplings. A press statement released by Lyca Productions said that C.V. Vigneswaran, Chief Minister, Northern Province, Tamil National Alliance leader R. Sampanthan, Malaysian Senate leader S. Vigneswaran, British all-party parliamentary Tamil council’s leader James Ferry and Justice Committee member Keith Vaz will be present at the presentation ceremony. \nThe actor is starring in Lyca Productions’ film 2.0 , expected to be released during Deepavali.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:11:38.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
