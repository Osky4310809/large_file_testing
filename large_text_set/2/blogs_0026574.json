Just how intense, though?\nNow their moms are involved. Shaq's mother reportedly intervened to calm things down between the two grown men â€” but McGee's mom isn't ready to bury the hatchet just yet.\nSEE ALSO: Finally, there's a Mike Tyson iPhone emoji for every situation\n\"He cyberbullied my son,\" Pamela McGee, a former U.S. Olympian and WNBA player, told The Undefeated this weekend . \"Totally inappropriate. Shaquille needs to lose his job or be suspended. The NBA needs to make a stand.\"\nWhile O'Neal is a household name, McGee might not be known to casual NBA fans. The center is enjoying a career renaissance with Golden State. This comes after several years during which McGee was a league laughingstock for his habit of making air-headed mistakes on the court â€” a reputation fueled in no small part by O'Neal frequently highlighting those mistakes with derisive glee on national TV.\nMcGee has eliminated the Jeff Spicoli moments from his game this season while excelling for the Warriors â€” but O'Neal hasn't stopped his relentless needling. He recently starred in a Doctor Strange parody for example, that looked back at some of McGee's career lowlights over the years.\nThat's how we got to this point, all fueled by Twitter posts between the two jumbo-sized hoopers.\nMcGee accused O'Neal of \"cooning\" â€” that is, entertaining white audiences by playing to black stereotypes â€” not once but twice. O'Neal threatened McGee that he'd \"smack the s**t out yo bum ass.\" McGee told O'Neal to \"EAD\", which stands for eating a part of the male anatomy that's commonly referred by a nickname for Richard. There was more back-and-forth, too, but you have a sense for the level of discourse here by this point..\nNow O'Neal says he \"has orders from the top\" to stop the bickering. \"The top,\" in this case, is his mom.\n@SHAQ get my ðŸ¥œ's out of your mouth! And EAD! #thatisall\nâ€” Javale McGee (@JaValeMcGee34) February 24, 2017\n@JaValeMcGee34 don't be acting like u a g I'll smack the s**t out yo bum ass u da one that be looking stupid with your dumb ass #bumass\nâ€” SHAQ (@SHAQ) February 24, 2017\n\"Itâ€™s not funny anymore, seeing the things theyâ€™re saying to each other. They need to squash this and move on,\" Lucille O'Neal told The Undefeated .\nOh we threatening people now? Kick rocks you old bastard... you ain't gone do sh** !!! And that's on my mama... stick to cooning! https://t.co/ZFuGREc1WJ\nâ€” Javale McGee (@JaValeMcGee34) February 24, 2017\n\"Now, I understand how after a while JaVale could get tired of it. Look at how many times heâ€™s been laughed at,\" she added. \"Bottom line, the mouth gets us in a lot of trouble. This is now reminding me of young kids on the playground, where one boy gotta have the last word. Sometimes you need to just walk away.\"\nA couple days before O'Neal and McGee's respective mothers weighed in, the Warriors reportedly approached TNT , O'Neal's employer, in an attempt to broker a back-channel peace deal between the two. But Pamela McGee, it seems, won't go so quietly.\nPamela McGee in 1999, when she was a WNBA player.\nImage: Eric Charbonneau/BEI/BEI/Shutterstock\nShe told The Undefeated that, \"as African-Americans, we have always had individuals who will sell out their communities for two barrels of rum. This is straight-up black-on-black oppression.\"\nShe also doubled down on her cyber-bullying claim.\nJaVale McGee is currently enjoying the best season of his career.\nImage: Herbert/CSM/REX/Shutterstock\n\"If you really want to get technical with it, itâ€™s bullying,\" Pamela McGee said. \"We all have little jokes and stuff. But when you continue to pick on just one person â€“ as his career is resurrecting â€“ thereâ€™s nothing to it but bullying. And itâ€™s unacceptable. You canâ€™t allow someone to continue to do this who represents TNT and the NBA. He is a representative of TNT and the NBA. Broadcasters are held to a higher authority. He should lose his job.\"\nFiring O'Neal for all this seems unlikely at best, although TNT had not at the time of this writing responded to our request for further comment.\nMeanwhile, if you're wondering: McGee, turned 29 years old last month. O'Neal turns 45 next week.\nBONUS: Learn how to play the guitar in 60 seconds thanks to this musical system", "external_links": ["http://theundefeated.com/features/shaq-drops-his-twitter-feud-with-javale-mcgee-on-orders-from-the-top/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/bumass?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/SHAQ/status/835050942852644864", "https://t.co/ZFuGREc1WJ", "https://twitter.com/JaValeMcGee34/status/835027942262484992", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/OkOstQLw.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/thatisall?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JaValeMcGee34/status/835051794619219970", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/2/24/14724964/shaq-javale-mcgee-twitter-beef-shaqtin-nba", "https://twitter.com/JaValeMcGee34", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PVC79AXiecgT4cKmic45_yw0r4Y=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F397790%2Fb6830843-9f61-4061-a27c-bed78786dad8.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6R8dRJ_I3ma9AE3kW9y5gEdDSIg=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F397785%2Ff4816aa6-3d90-47db-bb35-038bdc108482.jpg", "https://twitter.com/SHAQ", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/OkOstQLw.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d4LlYE-VgnF1m9jLsgKtsNAekr4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F397785%2Ff4816aa6-3d90-47db-bb35-038bdc108482.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BOPiMjn1sdbF03P8SrGxfr5c3XI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F397790%2Fb6830843-9f61-4061-a27c-bed78786dad8.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-28T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:10:14.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
