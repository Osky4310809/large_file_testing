Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nReal Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane appears to have aimed a dig at Barcelona over the manner in which they completed their stunning turnaround against Paris Saint-Germain. \nBarca reached the last eight of the Champions League in stunning fashion on Wednesday, scoring three times in the final seven minutes to win 6-1 on the night and turn around a 4-0 deficit from the first leg. \nReferee Deniz Aytekin's performance has been called into question in some quarters, though, with his controversial decision to award Barca the penalty from which they scored their fifth goal widely questioned. \nThat decision has, however, been somewhat overshadowed by the stunning manner of Barca's comeback and Los Merengues boss Zidane was asked on Saturday if controversial refereeing decisions involving his side are more heavily scrutinised. \n\"Real Madrid is unique,\" said Zidane. \"We know that we annoy certain people, but that is not going to change.

What interests me is our game tomorrow. \n\"They (Barcelona) are the same team. That isn’t going to change anything.\" Referee Deniz Aytekin's performance on Wednesday night has been called into question (Photo: Michael Regan) \nMadrid are gunning for glory in La Liga and the Champions League and Zidane has refuted claims he is prioritising a second consecutive European Cup win over domestic success. \nLos Blancos have won the Champions League twice - in 2014 and 2016 - since they last won the Spanish title in 2012. \n\"It is a long time since we have won La Liga,\" said Zidane.

We can’t play every three days in the same way, with the same intensity and determination. \n\"We are motivated for both the Champions League and La Liga. This year we want to win this league. \n\"People may think we don’t give as much importance to La Liga, but inside the club it is not like that.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T13:48:16.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
