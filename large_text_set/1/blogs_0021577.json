His performance has earned him a spot on the World Team for this yearâ€™s Rising Stars Challenge , a team that he will play on alongside fellow rookie Dario Saric. \nSixers Are A â€˜Thingâ€™ Again As â€˜The Processâ€™ Finally Pays Off \nOn the season, Embiid is averaging 19.8 points, 7.9 rebounds, 2.5 blocks and 2.1 assists all in just 25.3 minutes per game. He is also shooting 34.8 percent from beyond the arc and an impressive 77.7 percent from the free throw line. \nEmbiid responded to not making the squad with his signature humor on Twitter. Once again the popular vote didn't matterâ€¦â€¦ \nâ€” Joel Embiid (@JoelEmbiid) January 27, 2017 \nHis proclamation that the Sixers were thinking playoffs seems to have been the catalyst for the Sixersâ€™ resurgence.
