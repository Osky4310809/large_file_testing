At the time, I lived in Wisconsin with my boyfriend and the world felt sharp and uncertain. \nAfter spending countless hours on the couch, I needed something to do that would get me away from the TV. Baking seemed like a good idea. A recipe on the back of the Wooden Spoon Baking Book caught my eye, \"This cake is mixed right in the pan, without an egg to help it rise. The crazy part is that it turns out so well.\" \nSomething easy that turns out well? Just what I needed. \nFifteen years later, that boyfriend is now my husband, we live in New York, and the world, well, you know — at times, it feels sharp and uncertain. \nI still make the crazy cake. (Image credit: Lauren Volo ) What Is Crazy (or Wacky) Cake? \nThis cake, which seems to date from the late '30s or early '40s and also goes by the name \"wacky cake,\" doesn't use eggs or dairy. And you'd never know it. \nIt bakes up moist and tender, thanks to a combination of baking soda and vinegar, without any of the heaviness that often occurs in egg-free cakes. The texture reminds me of the classic comfort of boxed cake mix in the best possible way. \nIt's a perfect dessert to make for last-minute guests or for those times when you crave a slice of cake, but don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. How to Make the Best Crazy Cake \nCrazy cake is always going to be easy to make. That's its nature, but there are a few ways to ensure it's spectacular. 1. Mix the batter in a bowl, not in the cake pan. \nHere's where I depart from the classic preparation a bit. The original recipe directs you to combine the ingredients in the cake pan and stir. I have a few problems with this. It's messy. Mixing together a cake batter in a cake pan takes more work than it's worth. The cake sticks to the pan. \nTo solve these two problems, mix the batter in a bowl. Yes, it dirties an extra bowl, but it's worth it. And mix the batter with a whisk or fork; there's really no need to use an electric mixer. However, if that's more comfortable for you, go for it. (Image credit: Lauren Volo ) 2. Use the best cocoa powder (here's how to tell!). \nThere's only a 1/4 cup of cocoa powder — Dutch or natural, both work — in the recipe. To make sure the cake has a nice chocolate kick, use a high-quality cocoa powder. \nPro tip: An easy way to tell the quality of a cocoa powder is by checking the fat content listed in the nutritional label. The higher the fat, the better the flavor. You want at least one gram of fat for each five-gram serving. \nRead more: This Is Why Your Recipe Uses Cocoa Powder Instead of Chocolate 3. Coffee will make the chocolate more intense. \nIn baked goods, coffee has the magical ability to make chocolate taste more intense. For this recipe, use a cup of cooled coffee. If you don't want to use coffee, use milk (a dairy-free milk is fine). The original recipe for crazy cake use water, not coffee or milk, but water leads to a flat-tasting cake. (Image credit: Lauren Volo ) 4. Mix in no more than one cup of chocolate chips or dried fruit (or both!). \nSprinkle a handful of chocolate chips or dried fruit into the batter (dark chocolate chips and dried cherries are an especially nice combination). Use no more than one cup of chocolate chips or dried fruit (or both combined). More than that and the cake doesn't rise well. 5. The best topping takes only two seconds. \nMost of the time, I don't frost this cake. Once it's cooled, I sift some powdered sugar over the top and call it a day. Just put a little powdered sugar in a sifter or a mesh sieve and tap over the top. It takes two seconds and is pretty, fancy, and tasty. \nOf course, there are the times when life just needs a little frosting and the extra time is worth it. Top this cake with your favorite frosting when you need to. Chocolate, vanilla, and cream cheese frostings all taste great.
