The 25-year-old Walker, who batted .264/.321/.437 with 18 home runs and 64 RBIs, at Triple-A in the Orioles' organization last season, is now part of that mix. He has a Minor League option remaining. \n\"He hasn't had a lot of Major-League opportunity,\" Price said. \"He'll come in and we'll get him some at-bats and some time in the field, and give our staff and front office and scouts a chance to evaluate him close up as opposed to the short Spring Training looks that you get when you're trying to scout somebody.\" \nWorth noting • Reliever Jumbo Diaz , who was designated for assignment to make room on the roster for Walker, could possibly return to Reds camp as a non-roster player. Diaz, currently with the Dominican Republic squad for the World Baseball Classic , still must clear waivers before a decision is made. \n\"He hasn't lost favor in regards to the idea that he could give us some depth,\" Price said. \"He's pitched at the big-league level and I'm comfortable putting him out there. I think if there's innings for him here when he comes back, then absolutely. But if there's not innings, then no.\" \n• Pitcher Anthony DeSclafani , who missed several days last week with right elbow tenderness, threw off of the mound in a side bullpen session on Tuesday morning and he appeared to look comfortable. DeSclafani will get one more side session before being slotted to make his Cactus League debut. has covered the Reds for MLB.com since 2006, and previously covered the Twins from 2001-05.
