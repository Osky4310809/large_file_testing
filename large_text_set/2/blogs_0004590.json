King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted a day ago 8 \nDuring a recent Guitar World fan Q&A, Myles Kennedy was recently asked on \"what guitar techniques have you learned by watching and playing alongside Slash\" between early 2010 and late 2015. \nThe musician singled out two things: 1) the way he holds the guitar during solos and 2) the way he attacks the strings. The way I hold the guitar during solos \n\"One of the techniques that I've incorporated recently in the last year is - when he's playing in a higher register, he tends to lift his guitar up so that as opposed to being horizontal to the ground, it's more vertical so he can have better access past the 12th fret. Myles Kennedy: What the Future Holds for Slash's Solo Band \n\"That's something I never thought of before because there were a lot of times where I would get into that register and improvise or do a lead and it would be uncomfortable for my left hand. Watching him and noticing he would do that, it suddenly made sense.\" The way I attack the strings \n\"Another thing I've learned from him is the way he attacks the strings and the way he gets the sound, and I've learned that through Mark Tremonti as well.\"There's something to be said about how you hit the strings with your right hand and how that affects the sound. I was always about the economy of motion when I first started playing, and a lot of the players I was influenced by were a little more delicate with their touch. \n\"Slash is definitely more aggressive and I like the way that sounds, so it's definitely something I've learned.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T15:26:02.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
