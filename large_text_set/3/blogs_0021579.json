Because The Daily Caller is now reporting their sources say Lahren has already been suspended!\nAccording to their insiders, the host is in the middle of a suspension starting Monday and lasting at least a week.\nTomi was already reportedly at odds with her coworkers — that belligerent act isn't just on TV — when as far as they were concerned she called them all hypocrites on national television; multiple reporters from The Blaze have already tweeted their disgust with Tomi's comments.\nRelated: Fearless Girl Statue Vandalized To Look Like A Trump Supporter! \nLahren's contract was up in September, but don't expect her to last even that long before finding somewhere that can handle her views. BTW, we couldn't help but notice The View doesn't have a strong conservative voice at the moment…\nFor now, Tomi is keeping her head up, tweeting on Monday afternoon:\n\"When people praise you, don't let it go to your head. When people criticize you, don't let it go to your heart.\" #mondaymotivation \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 20, 2017 \n\nWhat do YOU think about the reaction to her comments??\n[ Image via ABC /Ray Garbo/ WENN . ] \nTags: business blitz , glenn beck , politik , pro-choice , social issues , the blaze , the view , tomi lahren , tv news", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:37:43.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
