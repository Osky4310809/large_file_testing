Nope. The problem is the snitches who told on Flynn. \nBut as Trump raises the idea that leaks could endanger discussions over North Korea, it’s highly instructional to see how he actually handled delicate information concerning a ballistic missile launch. \nThe press revealing that one of Trump’s cabinet members was under pressure from Russia?
