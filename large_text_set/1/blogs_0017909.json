Left with no choice, Casey calls his former employer and drug smuggler Geran ( Sir Ben Kingsley ) to protect his long-time girlfriend Juliette (Jones) before Hagen gets his hands on her. Casey sets out on an adrenaline-fueled car chase on the German highways to save the love of his life before it’s too late. \nWritten by Eran Creevy and F. Scott Frazier and directed by Creevy ( Welcome to the Punch ), Collide opens in theaters on February 24.
