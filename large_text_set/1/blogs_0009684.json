Coins Around the House - Pennies... \nAs remarkable as the previous stories are, there are even more mysterious occurrences. Money brought on the wind is one thing, but coins - sometimes dozens of them - inexplicably showing up around the house are even more difficult to fathom. This seems to be a growing phenomenon as I receive more and more stories about this happening. \nSometimes they're just pennies. Okay, it's not unusual to find some pennies lying around the house; they are easily dropped and lost. But what's notable about these cases is that they are found in unlikely places. One mother tells this odd story that began when her daughter moved into a new apartment... Since then she has been finding pennies in places where they could only have been placed deliberately, such as: between sheets in freshly made beds, in corners behind doors, in front of doorways, drawers, bathtub and garage. Recently, while watching TV in bed, a penny fell from the ceiling fan (while it was on). She once was standing in front of her dresser and one fell from somewhere.

The pennies were everywhere. I was going through a bad divorce and was really down, and didn't know what to make of it. My life got better and the kids and I adjusted to our new way of life. No more pennies. Then recently, I started having troubles with my 16-year-old daughter. She ran away and is involved with destructive behavior. Then the pennies started reappearing again - everywhere. I came home from work and there was a penny on my pillow in my bedroom! They seem to be everywhere that I go. ( Read the complete story ) \n...and Dimes... \nFor some reason, dimes seem to be the coins most common in these baffling experiences. For Ttait, the dimes began to manifest in 1995 when she struggled with completing college while raising her small daughter. Money was tight, but she began finding dimes , which seemed to appear out of the ether in the bathroom of her tiny one-bedroom apartment... Throughout the 18 months we lived there, I would constantly find dimes in our bathroom. Next to the tub I would find dimes. At first I figured they fell out of my boyfriend's pants pocket. Then I started to hear the distinct sound of coins dropping at all hours of day or night. The sound always came from the bathroom. This continued regularly, and I would pick up the dimes - sometimes there would be several and always in the same place near the tub. One day I was there alone and using the bathroom. While sitting there, I caught a motion in the corner of my eye in the open doorway. On the rug, was a dime next to the doorframe. It had fallen and landed soundlessly on the rug just outside of the bathroom. I am delighted to think it was a sign of caring from loving beings. ( Read the complete story ) \nW.D. was in bed one morning when a dime seemingly tried to communicate with her. It sounds strange, but she was lying in bed waiting for her snooze alarm to to off when this happened... All of a sudden, I felt a fast tapping in the mattress, as if someone were using their finger to get my attention. I then felt something touch my leg. At first I thought it was my little Pekinese next to me, but she was not in the room. As I put my hand down by my leg, I felt something small in size. It was a dime! I know it's a message of some kind, but not sure as of yet what it is.
