Watford 1-4 Tottenham \n\"They gave up defending right after half-time,\" he said. \n\"Amrabat was looking at the whole picture and must see Dele Alli make that run. \n\"'Should I? No, we're three down, forget it and let's got four down'. That is pathetic. \n\"You talk about being part of a team and busting a gut for the cause, but that is the exact opposite. \n\"It's a joke. It's right after half-time. It's not like it's the 92nd minute and he's tired.\" \nWatch the incident for yourself at the top of the page and listen to Souness' words.
