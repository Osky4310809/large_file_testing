And a Padma Bhushan awardee, which is one of India's highest civilian honours, which she got in 2011. Yes, there's a sense of real gravitas and respect when the name Chanda Kochhar pops up. This badass lady changed the face of retail banking in India. \nIn 1984, Kochhar, who came from humble beginnings, joined ICICI Bank as a management trainee. She proved to be a vital link in establishing the bank during the 1990s. The next decade saw her rise to the most senior positions; she became responsible for setting up the bank and headed its Infrastructure Industry Group. Her envious professional journey reached its zenith in 2009, when this powerhouse of talent was appointed as the managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) of ICICI. \nThe list of awards in her kitty is endless ... Business Woman of the Year, Rising Star Award, Retail Banker of the Year, Most Powerful Woman in Business Award, Woman of the Decade Achievers Award, ABLF Woman of Power Award, (one of the 25) Most Powerful Women in India Award, featured in Time Magazine's list of 100 Most Influential People in the World. Those are just a few! \nAccolades aside, Kochhar stole our hearts with the letter she wrote to her daughter that went hugely viral. The way she has managed to balance her high-powered career and home is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Case in point: during the 2008 recession when banks were hit badly, Kochhar still made it to her son's soccer game to cheer for him in the midst of hell at work. In the same letter, one also gets a peek into her growing up years: the equality with which Kochhar's parents brought her and her brothers up, the difficult years ahead when her father passed away when she was only 13, and how her mother raised three children as a single parent. Kochhar clearly didn't come from an ultra-privileged background, yet she tap-danced through life's obstacles to create her own incredibly successful journey - which makes her life story that much more inspiring. \nHere is a heart-warming excerpt from Kochhar's letter to her daughter Aarti: \n\"As a parent with a full time job, one must not let work affect the way you relate to your family. Remember the time you were studying in the US and the announcement of my becoming MD and CEO of ICICI was splashed across all newspapers? I remember the mail you wrote to me a couple of days later. â€˜You never made us realize that you had such a demanding, successful and stressful career. At home, you were just our mother', you wrote in your email. Live your life in the same way, my darling.\"Kochhar says that she believes in fate, but also believes that hard work and diligence play a very important role in our lives. She urges her children, as well as anyone who would, to take their destiny in their own hands, dream of what they want to achieve, and write it in their own way. \"Aim for the sky, but move slowly, enjoying every step along the way. It is all those little steps that make the journey complete\" is her mantra.
