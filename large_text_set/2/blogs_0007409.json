He said the Eiffel Tower, as a popular destination and France’s most famous monument, should have special protections in place, AFP reports.\nAs well as protect against gunfire, the new barriers are also designed to prevent attackers from storming the site in vehicles. Last year, a lorry driver struck a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in the southern city of Nice, killing 86 people.\nAccording to AFP, a string of attacks by jihadists in various parts of France have left 238 people dead over the past two years, with many of the incidents occurring in densely populated places such as houses of worship, transport hubs and tourist destinations.\nParis was on high alert last week after a 29-year-old Egyptian attacked a soldier with a machete outside the Louvre Museum, an incident that officials believe was likely a terrorist attack.\n[ AFP ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T15:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T10:52:33.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
