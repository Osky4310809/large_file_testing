Is this not right? It is normal but when you have an idea of football, when you have your philosophy, I think you have to overcome these negative periods. \n\"Honestly, I think Klopp's teams play attractive football and do very well.\" \nApart from Swansea City, Conte will have to face the only two teams that he has failed to beat as manager of Chelsea in the same week as Liverpool and Arsenal aim to close the gap in the league table. \nConte thinks that those games against their rivals in September were key as Chelsea put together a club record-breaking 13-game winning run in the league. However, he thinks that his Chelsea side have yet to hit their peak, despite his club holding an eight-point gap at the top of the table. \nMan Utd make Griezmann top priority \n\"This is only five or six months since I started to work with Chelsea, don't forget this,\" Conte added. \"I am a coach that when more time passes it gets better as I impart my idea, my philiosphy of football. \n\"At Juventus, we arrived at one point and we had a really good balance but only after work. In Chelsea we are working a lot in this aspect and in six months we have improved. If you compare our position now compared with this point last season, but for sure, we have room to improve.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:30:42.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
