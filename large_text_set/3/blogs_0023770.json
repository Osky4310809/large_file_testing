Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nEric Cantona has launched a damning attack on Manchester City and John Stones in his latest 'Commissioner of Football' rant. \nThe Manchester United legend, who appointed himself the 'Commissioner of Football', gave his views on the Premier League club during his latest musings for Eurosport . \nThe Frenchman was speaking about City's Champions League exit last week. \nPep Guardiola's men lost their second leg to Monaco 3-1, losing the tie 6-6 on aggregate - and were subsequently knocked out at the last-16 stage. \nCantona didn't hold back with his assessment. Cantona pulls no punches (Photo: Eurosport) \nHe said: \"Manchester Cityâ€™s defence are not the only one to blame for their very own infamous Brexit . \n\"We know now why John Stones was so expensive: because he comes with a fully equipped trailer that he pulls behind him when he plays. John Stones didn't enjoy his experience in Monaco (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"And the attack! Not a single shot in the first 45 minutes. The question now is not who is going to leave when summer comes, but rather, who is going to stay?\" \nOuch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:09:13.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
