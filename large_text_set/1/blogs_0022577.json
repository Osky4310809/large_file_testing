Security Council sided with Palestine and passed a resolution condemning Israel's settlements in Jerusalem. Attacks against one of the United States' greatest allies are just the most recent chapter in the U.N.'s dangerous agenda. I believe our involvement in the U.N. is a waste of taxpayer dollars.\" \nRogers tried to pass a similar bill in 2015, but his efforts were unsuccessful. \n“Why should the American taxpayer bankroll an international organization that works against America's interests around the world?” Rogers said at the time. “The time is now to restore and protect American sovereignty and get out of the United Nations.” \nThe current bill has been cosponsored by six other Republican members.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:39:26.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
