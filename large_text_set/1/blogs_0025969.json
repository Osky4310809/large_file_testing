The truth is that there are lot of Nigerians working about with “vertical sickness”, diabetics and hypertension fall into this category. The latter can be triggered by quantitative or qualitative overload leading to sudden death as witnessed in this sad event. Thus, regular medical check up is necessary with exercise and decent recreation to stop a “vertical sickness” progressing to “horizontal sickness” (stroke) or death. May The Lord God console the wife children and relatives he left behind. Amen. ubacom \nthanks for your inform comments, you just say my mind,imagine someone saying he was hale and healthy,how on earth did he know that,many Nigerians are walking dead,they have been traumatised already,lack of rest is what is killing many people back home,get some days off and rest at home,from the look of things this man overworked himself,this is not witches or wizard,its just taking care of one,s body,may his soul rest in peace Ifemelunwa \nAbsence of defibrillators in public places, pretty disturbing! Can imagine how many lives would have been saved in Nigeria. adegbite \ndo Nigerians know what defrbrilator means?all offices and workplace have it,its the first port of call in emergency situations like this,once you can keep the heart at least a minimum shot at,its likely the person can survive,we could see how Fabrice Muaba saved, somedays i just weep for our people back home, hon can a people come to this world and its suffering and hardship they see daily,not because they don,t work hard ,but they are supress by a brutal ruling class that siphon our money into thier pocket,when will this darkness go away from my place of birth? beema \nwe are not dumbos and stop generalizing things…and keep ur over sabi for ur domain.. gbekeleoluwa \nits not oversabi, this is why we are down,stop burying your head in the sand like the ostrich,someone is saying things as it shud be you are whining here,you should join him to shame the looters who can,t use our oil money to install defibrillator at all public places,for your information any work place here in the UK with this instrument is risking closure and fine,its the first thing in situations like happened to this poor lawyer, gbekeleoluwa \ni mean to write without this instrument koko \nmr yanky..stop insulting naija pple.. EDDY \nWHAT OF THE OLD FASHIONED CARDIO PULMONARY RESOCITATION (CPR). THIS MUST BE TAUGHT IN ALL SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN NIGERIA. ikenga \nifemelumma..cant even write ur name well..volunteer if u can..think what u can do for ur country rather than what ur country can do for u.jfk Baba osho \nThere is names called Ifemelunwa I have seen one living and working in Abuja she’s from Anambra state so the spelling is absolutely correct ikenga \nnot true..go and find the meaning..over sabi no good bro..what u said means something happened to my child and was meant to to say ifemelumma..some thing worth doing,is worth doing well.. burke \nhe wan teach u ur lang..imagine Rote \nWhen you are loosing in a discussion, all you need do is start correctimg others sentence. I left one for you “correcting”. \nThe former governor of a northern state died because of there is no stretcher to take him to the theatre hall after he suffered cardiac arrest due to attack from robbers. He spent about a whooping 15min before they figure it out to carry him with bare hands like a goat to the theatre hall. Unfortunately, it was too late to safe his life. They don’t give a damn because they can afford treatment abroad. Unfortunately. they will need first aid or stabilisation before they can be flown abroad in case of emergency situation. “What goes around comes around” Ifemelunwa \n@Ikenga…It is unfortunate you probably thought I was in a different world. You began your communication with a hiccup..very unpalatable, archaic and retrogressive. I saw how Fabrice Mumba was resuscitated, same can happen out here. This is not a challenge for relevant authority as observed. ipadeola \nthis is the issue that should engage people rather they will be busy on news about old men like Bamanga Tukur etc,this is why the mortality rate in Nigeria is abysmally low,some one goes into shock or coma he is gone just like that,this poor man was suffering from acute exhaustion due to his obvious tight schedules,Nigerians should learnt how to take vacation,get two weeks off your work or job,go to a place you will not be answering phone calls for a while rest and be in shape,so many like this situation abound at home,may his soul rest in peace Ish \nNot only that, Nigerians need to develop an habit of routine health check. It seems that this gentleman died of cardiac arrest, people have to realize that the common and major symptom of heart attack is death. May his soul rest in peace! sunday322 \nSorry my dear,death is never a symptom,but a prognosis or final outcome Baba Adini \nIpadeola, it is okay to judge, but it is better to look at our surroundings and see how sudden collapse does not lead to sudden death. Hence, the need for an organized emergency medical system trained to provide basic and advanced life support for the acutely sick or injured. It is a shame that nothing was done for this hardworking man when this incident happened. Even the president of the nation younger brother had a similar problem in a federal clinic and nothing was done to save to his life and yet the president, NMA striking striking and the minister for health haave no clue on how to improve our health care system. Shame on NMA, huge failure sunday322 \nDo you mean the mortality rate is low or high ? esaulogbon \nFor a long time they’ve been trying to kill the lawyer and finally they’ve got him. This simply shows how wicked and dangerous the yoruba tribe can be. The government must ban yorubas from carrying juju to court. uba \nyou should be ashamed of yourself,despite the informed and scientific reasons given by people of different ethnic background on this thread you still came here to spread your hate,Nigeria will continue to wallow in darkness due to people like you,you see things from a tribal view,its because you have never travel out of your comfort zone,travel out, to know that tribe is not an issue in life Adekunle Onifade \nIlliteracy traditionalism and superstitious beliefs are the bane of underdevelopment and a cardinal part of the vicious cycle of poverty Why @esaulogbon at this modern day of Science you still bury yourself in this retrogression of’ remote control’ and superstition. The unfortunate man was sick and was a ‘walking corpse’. People should cultivate the habbit of regular medical check up at least every three months. It was rather unfortunate and sad that he had to die suddenly. May his soul rest in peace senatorojd \nLol, I’m sure you felt good just when you hit the ‘enter’ button. Unfortunately, it only showed your level of literacy and tribalism has eaten deep into you that you cannot comment without going tribal.
