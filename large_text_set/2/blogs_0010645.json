On Tuesday night, things got even more fired up as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attempted to speak out against Trump’s Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions by reading from the letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 when Sessions was first put forth as an AG nominee. \nThe full video of Warren being silenced can be seen below, in which she pleads with the Senate to allow her to keep reading the words that Mrs. King wrote more than three decades ago and is promptly shut down. \nMcConnell silences Elizabeth Warren as she tries to read Coretta Scott King's 1986 letter that pleaded with Congress to oppose Jeff Sessions pic.twitter.com/w3fi2qx6Or \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 8, 2017 \n\n\nThe Senate ruled ot silence her with the reasoning that she was impugning the character of Jeff Sessions — even though she was only reading accurate words written ages ago by a Civil Rights leader who was fighting just as hard against Sessions’ confirmation as a federal judge in 1986 as some senators are fighting today against his confirmation as Attorney General. The Senate voted 49-to-43 (along party lines, with every Republican voting in the affirmative) that she was indeed impugning a senator’s reputation, which means she cannot speak at all now during his confirmation hearing. \nSenator Mitch McConnell, who led the roll call vote against Warren, stated on the record that “The senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama” and that “[Warren] was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted” which resulted in her being barred from speaking further. In what is no surprise at all, McConnell’s actions backfired and social media lit up with anger and indignation about the event. \nFor those curious — which should be many after this outburst on the Senate floor — the cover page of King’s letter against Session’s can be seen here with the full 10 pages of the document here . She spoke out against his racist practices, and his unfit status to ascend to the role of a federal judge. Things that still aptly apply to Sessions today.\n\n@sarahkendzior pic.twitter.com/BGPsYNmYrj \n— njb68 (@nbeaumont) February 8, 2017 \n\nAfter she was silenced, Warren tweeted a string of thoughts about what had just happened . \nTonight on the Senate floor, I tried to speak about why @SenatorSessions is totally unfit to serve as Attorney General.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 \nOn the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions 's judicial nomination: https://t.co/mnACXekh8f \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 \nI spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://t.co/qbty7x0iLl \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 \nI will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 \nI will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 \nTonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor – & millions who are afraid & appalled by what's happening in our country.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 \n\n\nMost importantly she said, \n“I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system.”\nThat thought is the most important for people to remember going forward, especially should other Democratic Senators be silenced in a similar manner if they speak out against Sessions as well. Republican Senators don’t want the public to hear about Sessions’ background in government, but somebody being brought down by others quoting their own legitimate opinions and actions is far from being “impugned.” \n(via The Washington Post )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:14:41.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
