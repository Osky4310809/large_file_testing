There can't be many people for whom the Lotus Exige Sport 380 isn't quite extreme enough. However, for those truly dedicated to the cause, there's now this: the Exige Race 380. More wing = more downforce. Much more Clue's in the name really, this Exige designed to compete in the Lotus Cup as well as \"a number of clubman championships\". To that end it isn't road legal and comes with a host of motorsport components including an Xtrac six-speed sequential, adjustable Ohlins dampers and AP Racing brakes.\nWhile power is unchanged from the Sport, the Race 380 features all sorts of tweaks to not only drop the dry weight to 998kg but also to achieve a 1:23.5 second lap of Hethel - the fastest Exige lap ever. The windows are plastic, the seat and intake pods are carbon and the airbag is gone. Note as well the engine cover, now an \"ultra-lightweight carbon fibre motorsport specific louvered tailgate panel\". \nAero tweaks include a new front splitter, that giant rear wing, additional vents front and rear plus a new grille to aid circulation through the engine bay; Lotus claims 240kg of downforce at 170mph, 100kg more than the road car. The ultra-lightweight forged wheels use Michelin Cup 2 tyres, a cassette type LSD is operated by carbon paddles behind the wheel and the Lotus traction control is finely adjustable from inside too. In case the pictures hadn't suggested it, this is a pretty serious racing car. \nJean-Marc Gales describes the Exige Race 380 as \"a peerless competition car designed to beat the best\". Certainly it would be one way to show up quite a lot at a track day. The Race is available to order now, costing £99,500 plus VAT; see you in the paddock... P.H.
