So in honor of Valentine’s Day, Babble is featuring content all month long that celebrates those special people (and moments) that make it all worth it. Click here for more on #BabbleThanksLove. Watch More Videos > \nIn the hustle and bustle of everyday life, it’s easy to forget all the good that surrounds us — the person (or people) who are there, no matter what. And though we may think it, we don’t always take time out of our busy schedules to thank them. Somewhere between carpool and bedtime, the words just seem to get lost. \nIn the spirit of Valentine’s Day, we asked people to write letters to their loved ones — that one person who is always by their side — and then read them aloud to each other. While the cameras rolled, we listened as one hilarious couple told us how their love story began (on their 60th wedding anniversary, no less), we met a couple with their first baby on the way, and a mother-daughter duo who are always there for each other when times get rough. \nWhile their stories may make you shed a tear, they also serve as a reminder to us all that even in the most difficult and turbulent of times, to be loved is the greatest gift of all.
