Redknapp is not a fan of Matip (Photo: REUTERS) \n“Everyone got carried away with Jurgen Klopp’s appointment but Liverpool are no better off than they were two years ago,” he said. \n“They were at their best in 2013-14 with Raheem Sterling, Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scoring goals for fun under Brendan Rodgers. \n“You thought ‘My God, whoever you stick in behind them, it doesn’t matter because those three will rip teams to pieces’. Redknapp was a big fan of Rodgers' side (Photo: Ben Hoskins/Getty) \n“Suarez was the best player in the Premier League, Sterling’s pace frightened teams every week and Sturridge was at the top of his game. Now you look at them and they don’t terrify you in the same way.” \nWriting in his latest column for the Evening Standard , Redknapp believes fans and pundits were guilty of being too easily won over by Klopp during his early weeks in charge at Anfield, but nevertheless reckons the Reds can continue their impressive record against top-six clubs when Arsenal visit on Saturday evening.
