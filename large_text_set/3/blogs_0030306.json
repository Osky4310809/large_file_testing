We battled all day long to get back on the lead lap, but we have got some work to do.” \nThe numbers bear that out. Through the first five races of the season, Johnson has just one top-10 finish — a ninth at Phoenix two weeks ago. He’s 17th in points. \n“I’m looking forward to spending the week with my girls (wife Chandra and his two daughters) and heading to Martinsville next weekend with this Lowe’s team,” Johnson said. \nWhat he’s not looking forward to is another trip to his pit stall like the sideways one he took below during the race at Fontana. But again, at least he had a sense of humor about it and said he’s ready to head to Martinsville Speedway, where he’s a nine-time winner at the short track. This was a first for me… a frustrating day for sure, bring on Martinsville. #NeverQuit #Chasing8 pic.twitter.com/qrIJ3dsh0M", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:30:11.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
