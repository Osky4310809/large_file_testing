Moonlight , you guys won Best Picture. This is not a joke,” the man said while holding out the statue to the filmmakers sitting in the audience. “This is not a joke. Moonlight has won Best Picture.”\nWarren Beatty , who presented the award, stood by the man’s side to explain what had happened. He says he was given the wrong envelope and he was reading the Best Actress winner announcement, for which La La Land ‘s Emma Stone was the winner.\nWatch the video below!\nBREAKING UPDATE: Following incorrect announcement, 'Moonlight' has won 'Best Picture' at the #Oscars . https://t.co/esmdczoPpT pic.twitter.com/9KWTsLlzrH \n— ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:29:05.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
