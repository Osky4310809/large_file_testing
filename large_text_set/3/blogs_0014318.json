Maybe it even put him in the zone, considering it was released in his formative years.\nUltimately, Wisconsin won, knocking VT out of the tournament.\nMaybe next year, Hokies. Until then, keep singing. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T06:22:54.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
