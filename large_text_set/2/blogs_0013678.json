Steven and his wife, Joana Pak, not only have the obvious giddiness of newlyweds , but they're also glowing with pregnancy joy ! The expectant parents used a photo booth as an opportunity to highlight Joana's rapidly growing baby bump, and their love is too sweet for words. \nUnderstandably, Steven's fans are overwhelmed with excitement for the couple and their growing family; some have even called out details, wondering whether Steven is dropping hints about Joana's pregnancy with his peace sign and double-bee caption. While we can't speak for any theories, we can say one thing with certainty: this couple is the absolute cutest.
