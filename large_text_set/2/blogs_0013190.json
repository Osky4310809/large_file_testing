Meet Chicago's essential dive bars—the places where the same bartender has been slinging shots for 30 years, the beer is cheap and the jukebox is loud. There is nothing \"artisan\" about these establishments, and that's why they're the perfect escape from the Valentine's Day cuddliness. \nIn addition to cheap beer, shots and grandpa-approved atmosphere, Chicago's best dives span generations and neighborhoods across the city. You can often spot them by nondescript Old Style signs hanging outside, warm Old Style for dirt-cheap on tap or in cans inside, your feet sticking to floors or decades-old carpeting, cardboard cutouts of swimsuit beer model ads from the 80s, and, if you're lucky, surly bartenders that may just swear at you in Polish. This list is ordered from north to south. \nSo cozy up with your true soulmate this holiday, or any day: cheap PBR. 1 Nisei Lounge \nYes, one of Chicago's best dive bars is just steps from Wrigley Field. Although you can watch Cubs' games at the self-proclaimed \"oldest bar in Wrigleyville,\" Nisei is in many ways the anti-sports bar — known for its delightfully no-frills atmosphere, cheap Old Style cans, free darts and board games, and plentiful Malort.
