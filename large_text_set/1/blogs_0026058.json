The Constitution is clear about this in Sections 145 and 146, where it states thus: Section 145 : ‘Whenever the President is proceeding on vacation or is otherwise unable to discharge the functions of his office, he shall transmit a written declaration to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to that effect, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, the Vice President SHALL perform the functions of the President as Acting President.’ Vice President Osinbajo \n“There is emphasis on ‘shall’ perform the functions as President. I want to tell you that there is precedence in Nigeria and it is not necessary going to England or America for learning. You will recall that when the late President Umar Yar’adua died, though there were some issues, eventually they were resolved and the Vice President stepped in as President. \n“This same process is applicable to the Office of the Governor. So, the duties of the Acting President are not limited. He can appoint and fire officials whose duties are regulated by him. There is no provision in whatever form limiting his powers as Acting President”. \nProf. Itse Sagay, the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, shared his perspective.””The Vice President can perform any function of the President, once he is acting. The word ‘acting’ is not important. The acting just means there is short time. When the President is not around, the Vice President becomes the President. This gives the Vice President all the powers of the President. So, in the absence of the President, the Vice President can perform all functions of the President”, Sagay stated. \nProf. Tahir Mamman, SAN, a former Director General of the Nigerian Law School, also spoke on the issue. \n“What functions the VP can perform when the President is away depend on the law and circumstances of the President’s absence. Taking the second part first, the Constitution requires the President to transmit to the National Assembly the fact of his absence for a certain period of time. This instrument confers on the VP the status of Acting President. In this capacity, the Acting President has no legal restrictions on the authority exercisable. Much of the restrictions on it will be political as the Acting President will need to be restrained and careful to avoid using his powers in such a way that may give the impression that he is harboring a different motive from his principal on the issues he takes decisions on”, Mamman said. \n“He will also likely to avoid pushing decisions on matters that will normally take considerable period for completion. By and large, such decisions therefore will be on on-going matters which need not to be put on hold because the President is away. Most importantly, the powers will enable the Ag President to handle emergency situations. Generally, unless the President is under serious disability, it is expected that there will be a quiet ongoing routine consultations between the two of them to ensure proper communication and understanding”. \nAnother lawyer, Mr. Itse Onagara, said: “This issue is not debatable. It is expressly stated in our Constitution that the Vice President shall act in the absence of the President. Why would his duties be debatable? It is clear that he shall perform all duties attached to the Office of the President, except where it is expressly stated in any statute book. And as it is, I have not seen any law which contradicts the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, nobody can give any mischief or golden rule interpretation to the provisions of the Constitution. \n“Considering the above , it is clear that there were no specific functions laid down by the Constitution and since the Constitution is silent on this and the Vice President is acting and performing the duties of Mr President, there would be no exceptions to what he can do.” \nBamidele Olajire, a Lagos based lawyer, equally spoke on the issue. His words: “There are express provisions in the Constitution, especially in Section 145 of the 1999 Constitution as amended that the Vice President’…shall perform the functions of the President as Acting President. `Yes, the Constitution makes provision for the VP to take charge of the affairs of governance. “However, the same law is silent on what he can do and what he cannot do. This is a big lacuna. The reason is that, for instance, the Vice President cannot assume the power of appointment of Ministers, making board appointments and what have you. \n“It will amount to a palace coup, if the Vice President starts embarking on such things within ten days of the absence of Mr President. To my mind, in spite of the fact that the Constitution gives the VC the power to act, it also envisage his limitations. Though, it may not be written, the situation demands that he needs to act and leave when the President resumes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T04:33:22.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
