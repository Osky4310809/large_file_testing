Culp, playing Texas Ranger Hoby Gilman, calls Trump's bluff and eventually arrests him for \"stealing.\" \nTrump sold the townspeople force-field umbrellas to deflect meteors. \nInterestingly, the character's speech is so similar to the president-elect's, it almost seems as if Donald Trump borrowed some catchphrases from Walter Trump. A portion of the dialogue follows: Narrator: Hoby had checked the town. The people were ready to believe. Like sheep they ran to the slaughterhouse. And waiting for them was the high priest of fraud.

I can build a wall around your homes that nothing can penetrate. Townperson: What do we do? How can we save ourselves? Trump: You ask how do you build that wall. You ask, and I'm here to tell you. \nDuring the presidential campaign, Donald Trump declared, \"Politicians have used you and stolen your votes. They have given you nothing. I will give you everything. I will give you what you've been looking for for 50 years. I'm the only one.\" \nOn June 16, 2015, Trump said, \"I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively,\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:00:48.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
