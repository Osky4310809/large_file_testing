Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nYaya Toure has restated his desire to stay at Manchester City, but his agent has revealed negotiations with other clubs have begun. \nAnd representative Dimitri Seluk has even claimed Toure would be open to an offer from rivals Manchester United. \nToure is one of six City players out of contract at the end of the season and has been free to speak to different clubs since January. \nUntil now he has not done so, but Seluk says that situation has changed and the outspoken Ukrainian did not even rule out what would be a contentious cross-city switch to arch-rivals United. \nSeluk told Sky Sports News: \"Why not? Jose Mourinho is a very good coach. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was together with Yaya in Barcelona. \n\"I understand this is two clubs who are rivals, but for me, for example, this is not a problem from Yaya or from me. This problem will be from Manchester City staff.\" Pep Guardiola talks to Toure (Photo: Getty) \nSuch a move would certainly upset City fans, but Toure spoke highly of them in his own interview with Sky Sports. \nHe said: \"In my first press conference, I told the media I come to City to achieve, to make a story and to be a big part of this club. \n\"When I look back it is something that is very important for me. The fans have been a big part of that because I have been at clubs around the world and enjoyed my football, but the fans at City have been unbelievable.\" \nAsked if he wanted to stay, the 33-year-old said: \"Definitely. I love this football club.\" \nWhether that happens or not depends on whether City offer the player a new deal. Manager Pep Guardiola has said contract issues will be dealt with at the end of the season. Toure will leave City this summer (Photo: Dan Mullan) \nSeluk said: \"From yesterday we officially started negotiating with different clubs about his future. \n\"We waited until March 15 for what Manchester City will say, but until now Manchester City don't say anything. Before March we didn't negotiate with anybody because Yaya does a lot with Manchester City, so we waited. \n\"But we cannot wait until the last minute, until June, and have no negotiations with anybody.\" \nHe added: \"Some clubs have contacted me. Now we have three options. I don't speak about Yaya and China or the MLS. He will play in Europe. I have spoken with clubs in different countries - Italy and Spain. \n\"If Manchester City want, they can start negotiations. If they don't want then we will find another club. \n\"Yaya can, tomorrow, sign a contract with another club and after that for Manchester City it is too late.\" Toure during last season's Manchester derby (Photo: Action Images via Reuters / Jason Cairnduff) \nToure was frozen out of the side by Guardiola earlier in the season after row between the club and Seluk. \nBut since that situation was resolved in November, the Ivorian has reclaimed his place and been highly influential in the City midfield, although he did not feature in Wednesday's Champions League loss at Monaco. \nToure, who also admitted he was overweight after some personal issues last season, credits Guardiola for his return to form. \nHe said: \"He's been honest with me. He is the guy that pushed me up, made me come back and that's why I'm feeling respectful with him and that's why I want to show him he was right.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T20:59:42.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
