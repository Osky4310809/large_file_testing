Barnes remains a Liverpool legend (Photo: Getty Images) \"He could hold and give and do it at the right time...\" \nWhen asked by the Daily Mail to name a best XI of players he featured alongside during his Reds playing days, it is no surprise that Barnes reeled off an impressive list of names. \nAnd a list which was very much based in the pre-Premier League era. \nHere's his team: Goalkeeper: Bruce Grobbelaar (Photo: Action) \nThe eccentric goalkeeper was a dependable last line of defence who won six league titles and the European Cup. Right-back: Rob Jones (Photo: Mirrorpix) \nThe only member of Barnes' XI without a league title, dependable right-back Jones famously never scored in 243 appearances for the Reds. Centre-back: Alan Hansen (Photo: Mirrorpix) \nHe didn't think you could win anything with kids, but the former pundit did win 23 major trophies over 14 years with Liverpool. Centre-back: Mark Lawrenson (Photo: Allsport) \nHansen's former punditry partner was also his former defensive partner, and he won the league in five of his seven seasons with Liverpool. Left-back: Steve Nicol (Photo: Getty) \nThe versatile Scot was a key player for Liverpool in the 1980s, and often chipped in with some vital goals. Right midfield: Ray Houghton (Photo: Getty) \nThe hard-working Irishman was a key component in the 1987/88 team which many claim was Liverpool's best ever. He won two league titles. Centre midfield: Steve McMahon (Photo: Mirrorpix) \nAfter starting his career at Everton, the Scouser became a hard man in the middle of the Reds midfield, winning nine major honours with the club. Centre midfield: Jan Molby (Photo: Getty) \nLiverpool's Great Dane is one of the club's greatest ever foreign players, and combined brilliant passing ability with a ferocious shot, winning three league titles. Left midfield: Ronnie Whelan (Photo: Getty) \nAfter moving over from Ireland as a teenager for just Â£35,000, Whelan went on to become one of Liverpool's longest serving players, winning six league titles and the European Cup. Forward: Peter Beardsley (Photo: Getty) \nAlthough only at Liverpool for four years, Beardsley certainly left his mark on the club. Operating as a highly-skilful second striker, he won two league titles and the FA Cup. Forward: Ian Rush (Photo: Getty) \nLiverpool's all-time leading scorer, Welshman Rush was undoubtedly one of the greatest forwards of his generation. He won 18 major medals with Liverpool, and was the club's top scorer in eight different seasons. What a team, eh Reds fans? And here's how it would line up.
