Kamala Harris thinks it’s outrageous that criminals might be deported for being CRIMINALS Posted at 2:10 pm on February 23, 2017 by Sam J. \nThe amount of derp in this tweet is painful. It’s outrageous the administration is saying anyone who might have committed a crime qualifies for deportations. \n— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 23, 2017 \nBeing here illegally is a crime in and of itself, Kamala, and in reality should be enough for them to be deported. That’s the law. If they commit a crime on TOP of the first one they should not pass go, they should not collect $200. \nThey should go home. \n— Michelin⭐SpiritChef (@CainGillespie) February 23, 2017 \nOh yeah, and it’s not just “anyone” who commits a crime, it’s illegal immigrants who quite frankly have already broken the law. But Kamala knew that, she’s just trolling. . @KamalaHarris What is outrageous is a senator openly advocating that the laws of this country do not matter to her. \n— Mujahed Kobbe (@Moj_kobe) February 23, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:50:21.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
