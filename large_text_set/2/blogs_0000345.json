But they said Amazon did not reverse its actions, so the former employees filed formal complaints with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, a required first step before suing a company in court. Advertisement \nUntil last August, the drivers worked for eCom Delivery Services, a subsidiary of Miller’s Express that Amazon hired to deliver packages around Boston. According to attorneys for the drivers, they were fired that month after Amazon instructed the firm to immediately “deactivate” anyone whose background check didn’t meet the company’s requirements. \nThe attorneys for the drivers said they were performing their jobs without issue and had only minor offenses on their records.

And because black and Latino people in the United States are arrested and convicted at higher rates than other groups, the policy is essentially a form of discrimination, the advocates said. \n“Amazon’s decision to fire them had nothing to do with their ability to perform the job, but was based solely on an overly strict background check policy,” said Oren Sellstrom, the litigation director for the lawyers’ committee, in a statement. \nAn Amazon spokesman declined to comment specifically on the discrimination complaints, but said that the company’s background check protects customer safety and does not consider “race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or other protected characteristics.” Advertisement \nOne of the fired drivers, Matthew Soler, said he was fired because of a long-ago suspension of his driver’s license, even though the license had been reinstated four years earlier. He said he had been working up to 70 hours a week for Amazon’s delivery contractor prior to his dismissal and had been trusted to train new drivers. \nWhile employers are generally permitted to run background checks on current and prospective workers, guidelines issued by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission prohibit companies from using the results in a way that “disproportionately screens out” people of a certain race or other protected group. The agency says companies must demonstrate their standards for hiring or dismissal are “job-related . . . and consistent with business necessity” and must individually review the circumstances of each worker. \nIt’s not clear what threshold Amazon used, the lawyers said. But regardless, they argued, the fired drivers should have been given a chance to put any past incidents in context. Dan Adams can be reached at . Follow him on Twitter @Dan_Adams86 .
