A companion bill was introduced in the Senate last week. \n“The Constitution grants Congress the power of declaring war, and we need to take that obligation seriously,” House Representative Jim Banks said in a statement on Wednesday. \n“Rather than continuing to fight ISIS under an authorization passed by Congress in 2001 to fight Al-Qaeda, it is time to pass a new authorization for the use of military force against ISIS. Congress should take a fresh look at the scourge of ISIS and evaluate the best strategy to defeat these radical extremists.” — RealClearDefense (@RCDefense) March 2, 2017 \nThe new bill would include the fight against ISIS in the resolution. Senator Todd Young (R, Indiana) introduce a version last week. Thank you @RepJimBanks for your leadership. Our troops deserve a clear message of support through a new AUMF. https://t.co/Yoe6hRvYqv — Senator Todd Young (@SenToddYoung) March 15, 2017 \nA background note sent with Banks’ statement on the bill states: “The AUMFs from 2001 and 2002 are overly broad, authorizing our troops to go to war with affiliates of any entity that contributed to the terrorist attacks on 9/11. While some legal scholars and Middle East experts argue that al-Qaeda evolved into ISIS, and therefore, the old AUMFs are still valid, the broad scope of the existing law needs to be revised as they are 15 years old and ISIS did not even exist as an organization when the old AUMFs were originally passed.” \nThe note also states that only 25 percent of the current members of Congress in the House and Senate were present when the current AUMFs were passed. \n“As such and as the President considers increases in military action, Congressman Banks wants Congress to lead in the conversation about going to war against ISIS, instead of merely paying the bill for the war.” Congress' failure to clarify #AUMF will allow #Trump Administration to expand the “battlefield” as it sees fit https://t.co/rE2J6w1Xxf pic.twitter.com/NfFGoFnnYk — Arab Center WDC (@ArabCenterWDC) February 26, 2017 \nMost on Capitol Hill agree that a new war authorization would send a clear signal to the troops that the country supports their mission, but Republicans and Democrats have been unable to move a plan forward for more than two years. \nFormer US President Barack Obama sent a request to Capitol Hill in February 2015, but Republicans said it tied the hands of a commander-in-chief who should have every tool at his disposal, while Democrats worried it was too broad and could become a blank check. \nThe new legislation would allow the US to detain members of terrorist groups. It would also require President Donald Trump to submit to Congress a comprehensive plan to defeat Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) within 30 days of signing the bill into law – a requirement that mirrors an order the president issued at the end of January, tasking military and security leaders to create a plan to defeat ISIS within 30 days. Details of the plan have not been disclosed publicly. \nAccompanying his budget request issued on Thursday, President Trump asked Congress to provide the Department of Defense with an additional $30 billion to “rebuild the US Armed Forces and accelerate the campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria…” \nThe request includes $5.1 billion in the “Overseas Contingency Operations budget for DOD to accelerate the campaign to defeat ISIS and support Operation Freedom’s Sentinel in Afghanistan. This request would enable DOD to pursue a comprehensive strategy to end the threat ISIS poses to the United States.” \nEven without a new AUMF, the US military has been expanding its fight against ISIS.

What are they going to do? To fight ISIS? The Americans lost nearly every war. They lost in Iraq, they had to withdraw in the end. Even in Somalia, let alone Vietnam in the past and Afghanistan, your neighboring country. They didn’t succeed anywhere they sent troops – they only create a mess.” \nOfficially, there are 503 US troops in Syria, according to the Pentagon, largely Special Forces operators who have been training local opposition troops.
