You have to have the co-operation of the provinces, obviously,” he said, then accusing some provincial leaders of mismanagement.\n“What do I do about that? Everything in my power to help them make the correct economic decisions on behalf of the rest of Canada,” O’Leary said. “I’m going to look for every leverage and fulcrum I’ve got. I do not agree to pushing down more economic decisions in the hands of people that are incompetent.”\nIf a province uses carbon pricing, O’Leary said he would “find a way to make it economically unviable for you to do that.” If a province goes above a federal cap for corporate tax rates, based on what Donald Trump implements in the United States, “I would then find a way to deduct that from some form of transfer or equalization payment.”\nRelated Paula Simons: O’Leary’s ‘vicious poisonous toxic’ attack on Alberta self-determination should offend us all Conservative Party expels nearly 1,400 members after three leadership campaigns allege fraud John Ivison: Maxime Bernier says Conservative leadership race is down to himself and Kevin O ’Leary O’Leary rejected the characterization that using such tactics is a way of punishing provinces that have policies he disagrees with.\n“No, no, no. It’s not a punishment. It’s coercing them to do the right thing for their people,” he said.\nO’Leary went on to say he would overhaul how equalization payments work, calling them “investments.”\nThe transfer program, which is supposed to address fiscal disparities among provinces, is written into the 1982 Constitution. Payments are unconditional and “receiving provinces are free to spend the funds according to their own priorities,” according to Finance Canada.\n“I don’t want to just send money not knowing what it’s going to, because look at what happens,” O’Leary said, accusing Ontario, specifically, of “wasting” the money.\nEqualization payments for Ontario have been declining. In the 2017/18 financial year, Ontario will receive $1.42 billion, down from $3.26 billion five years ago. In total, $18.25 billion will go to six provinces this year.\nReceiving payments “disincentivizes” provinces from developing their own economies, O’Leary said, pointing specifically to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which he said should be developing their land-based natural gas resources. “They can simply point out their hand and say, ‘give me an equalization payment.’”\nHe said he would invest even more if he agrees with how money is spent. He’d sit down with individual provincial leaders and ask them to “show me what you’ve got.”\nThe Conservative Party’s existing policy favours decentralization. In its most recent policy declaration last June, the party commits to “the notion of strong provinces within Canada,” and “respecting the division of power and responsibilities outlined in the Constitution of Canada.”\nOn equalization payments, the party has traditionally focused on reforming the formula that determines who gets what, rather than earmarking funds. The platform that got Stephen Harper elected in 2006 said, “we will ensure that no province is adversely affected from changes to the equalization formula.”\nIt also accused the governing Liberals of launching “pointless attacks on provincial premiers” and cutting “one-on-one deals with some provinces that have left everyone dissatisfied.”\nO’Leary, for his part, has not been shy about attacking specific leaders.\nI do not agree to pushing down more economic decisions in the hands of people that are incompetent.\nWith comments reminiscent of other recent media appearances, he called Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley “very, very, very weak leaders when it comes to managing the economy.”\n“These leaders need a tremendous amount of adult supervision and they don’t have any skill sets,” he said, adding he “can’t tolerate that level of mediocrity and incompetence.”\nNotley was asked about some of O’Leary’s recurring comments last week. She told reporters Thursday it’s “not really my plan” to debate with candidates who want to generate media attention with “fun, creative and somewhat wacky approaches.”\nAlthough the words he uses to characterize premiers’ performance have drawn ire, O’Leary was facing criticism Monday for something else.\nIn a statement, O’Leary floated his idea to enforce border security by invoking the notwithstanding clause — a part of the Constitution that allows federal or provincial governments to temporarily pass legislation that contravenes Charter rights.\nHe suggested the clause could be used to close a “loophole” in the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country agreement that allows illegal migration to persist. The statement was criticized online for being out of line with what the notwithstanding clause is for, given that Canada can simply leave the agreement.\n“I suggest they go back and study the Constitution,” O’Leary said of critics, saying he would pass legislation to deny asylum claim rights to people who cross the Canada-U.S. border illegally. “This is a gift Trudeau’s father gave to his son.”\nO’Leary brought up the War Measures Act invoked by Trudeau in 1970 during the October Crisis, which was used to detain and arrest hundreds of Front de libération de Québec militants in the wake of violent attacks.\nO’Leary said the Act was prompted by an “extraordinary situation” and used the same phrase to describe illegal border crossings.\nMarie-Danielle Smith • Email: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: amariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:06:24.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
