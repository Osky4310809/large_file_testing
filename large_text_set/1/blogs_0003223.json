(Environment Canada/screenshot) See the latest Alberta weather warnings and conditions. \nSouthwestern Alberta is under an ongoing snowfall warning, with up to 15 additional centimetres expected to fall in some areas on an already thick layer of snow. \nEnvironment Canada warnings were in place for the areas around Cardston, Fort Macleod, Magrath, the Crowsnest Pass, Waterton Lakes National Park, Kananaskis-Canmore, Okotoks, High River and Claresholm Sunday morning but by the afternoon many had been lifted. \nCardston, the Crowsnest Pass, Fort Macleod, Magrath, Pincher Creek and Waterton Lakes National Park remained under snowfall warning at 7:30 p.m. MT. \n\"Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions,\" said Environment Canada in its warning. \"Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. If visibility is reduced while driving, slow down, watch for tail lights ahead and be prepared to stop.\" \nCalgary dodged a weather warning although snow continues to fall, with almost three centimetres coming down overnight and a further two centimetres expected during the day. \nThe temperature in the city will plunge to –18 C tonight, with the windchill factor making it feel like –25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T05:34:31.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
