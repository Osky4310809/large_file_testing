The warmth in the shade prevents it from making you look like you're cold.\" — Lexi Novak, beauty editor $21 ( toofaced.com ) Too Faced Sweethearts Bronzer \"When I first tried this, I wasn’t sure if it was even going to show up on my medium-dark skin tone. But it actually gives me the perfect amount of color and glow.\" — Kat Suico, beauty assistant $30 ( toofaced.com ) Too Faced Born This Way Concealer \"It brightens my dark circles and makes me look more awake. And I love how when it's applied with a BeautyBlender, it doesn't crease at all.\" — Elizabeth Denton, digital editor $28 ( toofaced.com ) Too Faced Better Than Sex Waterproof Mascara “When I’m not working, I’m probably tapping back at spin class — with full, voluminous lashes. I know, I know. Wearing mascara during a workout isn’t necessarily ideal (or eye-safe), which is why I solely stick to waterproof formulas like this one. It goes on even, coating every lash, and doesn’t smudge — even when I’ve got sweat tears streaming down my face.” — Sarah Kinonen, digital associate beauty editor $23 ( sephora.com ) Too Faced Shadow Insurance Primer \"I’m not lying when I say I use this primer every day. It ensures that the blending I do in the morning stays put all day long.\" — Devon Abelman, assistant digital editor $20 ( ulta.com ) Too Faced Milk Chocolate Soleil Bronzer \"Not only does it smell delicious (like cocoa powder), but it's also easy to lightly blend along my jawline.\" — Sam Escobar, deputy digital editor Too Faced Sweet Peach Eye Shadow Palette \"Forever and always my favorite eye shadow collection. The range of soft browns, flushed peachy shades, and pretty jewel tones (like deep purples), make brown and green eyes look perfectly honeyed. I use Caramelized as my daily work shadow, and layer on Charmed, I’m Sure for a night out. Talk Derby to Me looks perfect smudged at the lashlines.\" — Jessica Chia, senior beauty editor $49 ( sephora.com ) Too Faced Melted Lipstick in Melted Peony \"Sometimes I want my milky-pink surfer-girl lips matte. And when I do, this is the go to. It has a cool matte finish and stays on forever.\" — Patricia Tortolani, contributing editorial projects director $21 ( toofaced.com ) Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara \"Better Than Sex mascara might be actually better than sex. OK, maybe not, but honestly I’ve never seen a mascara plump up and lengthen my lashes like this one does. When I have it on, everyone asks if I’m wearing falsies.\" — Elizabeth Denton, digital editor", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:30:25.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
