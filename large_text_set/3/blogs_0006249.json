Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA city worker has been jailed for three years after admitting to killing his former colleague with a single punch - in a row over his shoe being thrown out of a minicab window. \nAlexander Thomson, 32, attacked Thomas Hulme, 23, when he reacted to the drunken prank by lashing out at the recruitment consultant and hitting him in the head. \nThomson was on a night out with former colleagues on August 26 and had jumped in a minicab with three other passengers close to Farringdon station. \nHulme threw Thomson's shoe out of the window, and he responded by punching him in the head. \nThe victim collapsed, and at around 11.20pm, the taxi driver stopped by the junction with Old Seacoal Lane, near Ludgate Circus in the City. \nEmergency services were called to the scene, and Hulme was taken to hospital. \nHulme, from Tooting, south west London, died the following evening. \nThomson was found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey .

Back on August 26 Alexander Thomson was one of four people who got into an Uber taxi travelling southbound down Farringdon. \n\"They were going to Clapham for a house party. All the people in the car were drunk or slightly drunk. It is important to point out there was no bad anger at this point.\" \nHe told the court Thomson admitted to police he had drunk \"45 bottles of beer\" as well as vodka, shots of Jagermeister and \"two small snorts of cocaine\". \nHe added: \"In the taxi Mr Hulme threw the defendant's shoe out of the taxi while it was pulled up at the lights. The shoe landed on the bonnet of a nearby car. Thomson then punched Mr Hulme once to the head.\" \nMr Cray then read out an emotional victim impact statement on behalf of the family. By this point Thomson began crying in the dock. \nHe said: \"Life is unpredictable and we are in shock. We are still in disbelief. Our lives have changed forever. We have been submerged in sadness and sorrow. Our lives will never be the same again.\" \n\"They got out and continued the argument. They got to the pavement where Tom collapsed. He was pronounced dead the following day.\" \nPreviously, Lisa Wilding QC, defending, said his defence team had been seeking expert evidence from a psychiatrist or psychologist. \nShe said: \"The defendant has since these tragic events been seeing two different counsellors in respect of both alcohol consumption and more specifically the underlying issues that might have been masked by that alcohol consumption. \n\"Can I make clear that Alexander Thomson recognises that a custodial sentence will be the expected sentence following his guilty plea. \n\"It is however a case where we submit all of the circumstances of this case are such that the court should know why it is that matters escalated to the level that they did that night, with the wholly unexpected but tragic consequences.

At his arrest he made full admission to these incidents which led to this untimely and unforeseen death. From the outset he has accepted his responsibility. \n\"That one punch, which was not delivered with full force but was delivered as a result of tomfoolery which preceded it. My lord will, I hope, accept that spur of the moment foolish gesture was delivered as a flash of silliness and anger.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T13:32:59.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
