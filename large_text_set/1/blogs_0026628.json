Boogie and the Kings are in Philadelphia on Monday night, and while they let the Sixers back in the game despite holding a double-digit lead at one point in the third quarter, it wasn’t the fault of cousins.\nThe highlight of his evening was this ridiculous bounce pass to Darren Collison. The impressive part was that Cousins threw this pass from one foul line and Collison corralled the pass at the opposite foul line. This is insane – as Sixers broadcaster Alaa Abdelnaby pointed out, there aren’t many big men who would ever attempt this (Abdelnaby specifically shouted out Arvydas Sabonis, who is quite possibly the best passing big man of all time ).\nBecause they’re inexplicably one of the most fun teams in the NBA, the Sixers decided that they wanted to try and one-up this Cousins pass. To do this, Robert Covington attempted to throw a full-court pass from the baseline before the clock expired at the end of the quarter. Here’s how that worked out.\n\nCovington from 94 feet away… pic.twitter.com/GyU5NSBgIP \n— Dime on UPROXX (@DimeUPROXX) January 31, 2017 \n\nYup, Covington connected with Gerald Henderson for a dunk. Here it is from the opposite angle, which shows how accurate Covington’s pass was, mostly because the Kings forgot to get all the way back.\nTOUCHDOWN pic.twitter.com/zvl4KzpDZe \n— Philadelphia 76ers (@Sixers) January 31, 2017 \n\nIf that wasn’t impressive enough, here’s Dario Saric throwing a crazy pass over his head to a wide open Jahlil Okafor.\nDARI-OMG pic.twitter.com/tfXxnDIpwr \n— Philadelphia 76ers (@Sixers) January 31, 2017 \n\nYou can argue that either of these are better than Cousins throwing a bounce pass the length of the court. I will disagree, but all of these passes are insane, so there really isn’t a wrong answer on this one. The only shame is that two of these three didn’t end with the guy throwing the pass picking up an assist.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:32:47.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
