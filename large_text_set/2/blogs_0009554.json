Barcelona-based modern artist Pejac transformed the broken windows of an abandoned power plant in Rijeka, Croatia into a surprising and stunning canvas depicting a flock of birds fleeing from a boy with a slingshot. The artist used the existing cracks in the glass to create the silhouettes of birds in an intervention titled Camouflage, which Pejac says is a tribute to the Belgian surrealist artist René Magritte. \nPejac draws inspiration from Magritte’s use of painted window-like birds that reveal clouds and sky within their silhouettes. The Barcelona-based artist created the illusion of birds in flight through negative space, but the intervention is so subtle that it’s easy to miss at first glance. According to Arrested Motion , the artist intended to highlight the survival instinct found in nature by showing how the birds camouflage themselves to survive. \nRelated: This massive 11-story mural in Chile celebrates treehuggers \nCamouflage (Tribute to René Magritte) is considered Pejac’s most complex work to date and took a few days to complete. Unlike the birds, the silhouette of the boy with the slingshot was painted on with black acrylic . The piece was completed as part of the artist’s residency with the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:12:41.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
