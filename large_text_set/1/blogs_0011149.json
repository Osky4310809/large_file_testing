Post to Facebook Lakers and Clippers fans boo Chargers logo Welcome to LA!  //usat.ly/2ixv3E4   Join the Nation's Conversation To   Lakers and Clippers fans boo Chargers logo Alysha Tsuji , USA TODAY 5:14 p.m. ET Jan. 14, 2017 \nLos Angeles' two NBA teams played against each other on Saturday at Staples Center, and Chargers tight end Jeff Cumberland was there, so they showed him on the jumbotron, as they usually do when anyone of note is in attendance. But before showing Cumberland, the Chargers' new logo was shown. \nAccording to multiple reporters at the game, it made for a pretty awkward moment. Fans booed the Chargers logo, but then sort of applauded Cumberland. They just showed the Los Angeles Chargers logo on the scoreboard at Staples Center. The crowd booed. pic.twitter.com/wIzlfU6t2C — Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) January 14, 2017 Awkward moment after Lakers/Clippers fans booed the LA Chargers logo, video board moved to Chargers TE Jeff Cumberland who got some cheers. — Tania Ganguli (@taniaganguli) January 14, 2017 Chargers logo on big screen: Fans boo Pan to unidentified man in crowd: Fans confusedIt's Chargers TE @jcumberland87 !

For now, though, while both the Rams and Charters aren't very good, the confused booing/cheering will probably continue.
