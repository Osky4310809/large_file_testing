However, you may want to put some work in that beach body beforehand. This week, Google announced a new service in the US that will allow people to reserve and pay for fitness classes via Google Maps and Google Search.\nSee also: Best Android fitness apps and workout apps January 17, 2017 \nThe Google Maps support for this new feature is restricted to the desktop, but it’s available for Google Search on both desktop and mobile. All you have to do is search for the fitness studio you want to attend and then click “Reserve with Google”. You can check out the studio’s current class schedule, reserve your specific day and time, and pay in advance.\nYou can also do the same thing by going to the Reserve with Google website, and it will offer additional options such as recommendations for new classes, special discount offer when available and more. It even lets users buy class packages or full memberships. The number of providers that support these features include MINDBODY, MyTime, Genbook, Full Slate, Front Desk, Appointy, and more.\nAgain this new feature is just for US residents, and there’s no word if Google plans to expand its online fitness classes service to other parts of the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:35:20.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
