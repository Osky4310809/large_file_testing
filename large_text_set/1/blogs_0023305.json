Kudos go to general manager Thomas Dimitroff and his staff, but Dimitroff has been with the Falcons for years, and the team never did this well in the draft. The real difference-maker is head coach Dan Quinn, the former Seahawks defensive coordinator who did a lot to help head coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider assemble the Legion of Boom defense. Scott Cunningham/Getty Images Quinn has always had a good bead on the right types of players for his aggressive defense and how best to use them. In Seattle, he was the one who turned Red Bryant, a former washout at defensive tackle, into the only 360-pound defensive end in NFL history—to great effect. And when the Seahawks picked up Michael Bennett in free agency in 2013, Quinn was the one who turned him loose as a multi-gap disruptor. That combination of personnel acumen and mental acuity has worked well for Quinn in his two years with the Falcons, and the draft picks prove it. In 2015, the team selected Clemson edge-rusher Vic Beasley in the first round; he led the NFL in sacks in 2016 with 15.5. Second-round pick Jalen Collins from LSU has been Atlanta's most consistent coverage cornerback in the second half of the 2016 season, keeping that secondary afloat after the season-ending pectoral injury that sidelined Desmond Trufant in November. The real steal from that 2015 draft, though, was defensive tackle Grady Jarrett. Somehow, the leverage monster from Clemson lasted all the way to the fifth round, and the Falcons were lucky to get him. At 6'1\" and 290 pounds, Jarrett may not pass the size test that many teams apply to disruptive tackles, though given the recent success of Geno Atkins and Aaron Donald, it's possible NFL teams should re-examine their templates. Jarrett has been an absolute force in both of his NFL seasons. He has three sacks , eight quarterback hits, 30 quarterback hurries and 25 stops this season, and his ability to command double-teams on a high percentage of plays allows Beasley and Atlanta's other linemen to get free to disrupt. But the 2016 draft class really has people noticing that the Falcons are assembling the league's next great young defense. First-round safety Keanu Neal from Florida has become for Quinn in Atlanta what Kam Chancellor was for Quinn in Seattle—the enforcer lurk defender who will sit in short-to-medium coverage and make receivers think twice about coming over the middle. Second-round linebacker Deion Jones from LSU has become the paradigm for one of the most important positions in the modern NFL—the mid-field 'backer who can cover tons of ground in any direction. From blitzes to run stops to deep coverage, Jones can do it all, and it's why he has my vote for Defensive Rookie of the Year. Fourth-round linebacker De'Vondre Campbell has been nearly as effective on the outside, and undrafted cornerback Brian Poole has been a valuable addition as a slot cornerback and occasional blitzer. The result is that a formerly porous, uninspired defense now looks like the Seattle squad I saw firsthand in the early days of the Carroll era: prone to youthful mistakes at times but filled with speed and power and coming to terms with its potential. It's this defense that will go up against Tom Brady and the Patriots in Super Bowl LI, and it's this defense that absolutely obliterated the Packers' passing game in the NFC Championship Game. Aaron Rodgers , who had been on a ridiculous hot streak in the season's second half, was rendered mute, completing 12 of 17 passes for 119 yards, no touchdowns and an interception in the first half, and 27 of 45 passes for 287 yards and three garbage-time touchdowns overall. When the game was still competitive—which wasn't for long—the Falcons shut Rodgers down after a few easy completions. They did so especially well on third down; the Packers converted four of their 10 third-down attempts, while the Falcons converted 10 of 13. How did this defense do it? With a compelling combination of pressure and coverage that will be needed against Brady and his targets. Let's start with the final play of Green Bay's first drive. There's 5:44 left in the first quarter, and after a couple of easy throws to Jordy Nelson , Rodgers is starting to feel this defense moving around his neck. Deion Jones (45) is the star on this play with a delayed blitz to force Rodgers out of the pocket and make him throw the ball away. Jones waits until Green Bay's blockers are occupied and shoots through unobstructed. The Falcons also use this strategy with Beasley moving between gaps pre-snap, but it's Jones' turn to bring the heat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:10:15.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
