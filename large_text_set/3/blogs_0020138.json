The bad is that the Wii U version has been canned. \nThe reason for this is obvious: the Wii U will no longer be contemporary by the time Bloodstained launches in 2018. \n\"During our Kickstarter campaign, the Wii U was at the height of its popularity, but the situation has drastically changed after the release of Nintendo Switch,\" Igarashi said in a Kickstarter update . \n\"This change made it difficult to receive the necessary support from the hardware maker, which has led us to drop the Wii U development and shift the development to Nintendo Switch.\" \nThose who backed Bloodstained in hopes of a Wii U version are eligible for a refund. You must request one of these by 20th April, 2017. Contact orders@fangamer.com with the subject \"Bloodstained Wii U refund.\" Note: include the email address tied to your PayPal account. \nShould you simply want Bloodstained on another platform instead, you can change your reserve to request a copy of the game on Switch, PS4, Xbox One, PC or Vita. \nWii U backers who don't act will have their reserve automatically converted to the Switch.
