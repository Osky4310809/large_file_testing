They don't know the dangers. They don't know Putin's real role in the world. He is far from the greatest threat to America.\"\nHe added, \"the threat that Putin represents to the United States -- probably wouldn't make the top five. But they're testifying in Congress that it's number one. And this is a threat to our own national security.\"\nTucker, while conceding that he's not an expert on Russia, agreed with the professor, saying it \"comports with common sense.\"\n\"It does seem like hysteria has seized D.C.,\" Carlson said.\n\"And we're in danger, as a result,\" Cohen concluded.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/14/prof-stephen-cohen-anti-russia-hysteria-putting-united-states-in-danger/", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxHGDSwqyQw"], "published": "2017-01-14T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:40:55.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
