Gen. Rogers Nicholas, said, “The group specialises in producing babies and distributing them to other states in the country. The group was intercepted after intelligence report by the OPSH troops. \n“The group comprises eight men and three women operating in Jos.” \nDuring interrogation, one of the suspects, who did not mention his name, said the group had a network spread across the country, which enticed young ladies with mouth-watering offers.” \nNicholas vowed that other members of the syndicate in the state would be apprehended. \n“As investigations continue into the activities of the syndicate, it is important for security outfits to extend its network across the states, especially places where the babies are being sold, so as to apprehend those involved in the horrible crime,” Nicholas said. \nThe state Governor, Simon Lalong, through his Senior Media Assistant, Mark Longyen, described the discovery of the baby factory by the task force as a good development. \nLalong assured residents that criminals had no hiding place in his state, saying the suspects would be prosecuted after investigation. \nA child rights activist, Osim Jones, said the discovery had shown clearly that even though the state was one of the states in the North that had passed the child rights bill into law, some persons were bent on breaking the law. \nCopyright PUNCH.
