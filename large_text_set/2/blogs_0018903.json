Some of the topics and scheduled speakers have upset parents but when they tried to ask for a more balanced approach, they were shut down immediately, and the event will go on as planned. \nFrom PJ Media : \nThe All-School Seminar Day at New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, is set for February 28 and focuses on “understanding today’s struggles for racial civil rights.” It’s a full day of panel discussions led by radical left-wing speakers, covering topics such as “Behind the Veil of Racism,” “21st Century Voter Suppression,” “Examining Our Biases,” “Microaggressions: Voices from Literature,” Empowering Diversity Through a Growth Mindset,” and workshops on “Appropriate Alliances: Working in White Spaces.” \nYeah, it’s pretty easy to see why parents are outraged their children will be exposed to this blatant propaganda and won’t hear any counter arguments like how “government policies that confine poor children to failing inner city schools, devastate black families, and encourage crime and dependence.” Nor will they hear from conservative speakers like Walter Williams or Allen West as concerned parents suggested. The school refused to change anything about the seminar. It is “as-is,” and that’s that. \n“I have had well over 300 phone calls, emails, and letters of support saying ‘Don’t change it, it looks fabulous,’” the superintendent said. “The direct communication we’ve had has been far more in support than in opposition. In fact, I’ve never seen this kind of outpouring of support on an issue in my life as an educator.” \nWho can argue with that display of tolerance? \nSo, kids get to hear rapper John the Author speak to them about racism; a guy who wrote lyrics that include, “Divide and conquer, white supremacy the silent monster” and a poem called “Blackenomics,” which relies heavily on the word “nigga.” And Monica Trinidad who will teach an entire seminar on genocide by whites and otherwise spends her time on Twitter complaining about cops: “Get them animals off those horses.” \nOne black parent, Robert Blackwell, spoke out against the program, too, saying Black Lives Matter activists don’t “represent the best of black Americans” and the movement “does not advocate anything that has a track record of making black lives better:” \n“All this emphasis on trying to make whites feel guilty for the real and perceived sins of descendants of Europe is non productive. \n“If you want to hold a seminar on Socialism then invite whoever you want. But don’t have a seminar of Race and invite socialists that have no other message except America and White Americans in particular are evil. \n“White Guilt doesn’t make black lives matter and neither does America bashing.” \nThese parents have made it clear that they don’t want the event canceled or censored, just that there be some balance so both sides of an argument can be heard. They’re also upset that the seminar cost $533,000 of diverted funds that were okayed without any parental input. \n“This is our school. These are our kids. Parent input is essential,” they argued. But as usual, no one is listening.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:20:35.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
