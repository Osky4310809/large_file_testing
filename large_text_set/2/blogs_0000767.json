We need to achieve a hunger-free Nigeria. \n“Henceforth, students who are not interested in becoming farmers should be made to seek admission elsewhere,’’ Ogbeh said. \nHe assured that the government would support students in researching for their self-actualisation. \nThe Chairman, House Committee on Agricultural Production and Services, Mr. Mohammed Munguno, advocated a bill to establish the National Universities Agricultural Commission to regulate operations of the Universities of Agriculture. \nHe said the National Assembly would amend their rules to ensure that the universities were domiciled in the ministry. \n“There is need either through an executive bill or a bill to be sponsored by the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture for the establishment of the National Universities of Agricultural Commission. \n“It will be charged with regulating the universities of agriculture to effectively perform their statutory roles in tandem with the laws establishing them,’’ Munguno said. \nThe Pro-Chancellor of the Micheal Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia, Prof. Anya O. Anya, lauded the government for the relocation. \nAnya, who raised concern over the disconnect with the science and practice of agriculture in the country, expressed the hope that the assigning of the universities to the ministry would boost their effectiveness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:12:37.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
