The photographer says he taught himself the clever technique by watching YouTube videos. \nHe now says he would like to create an exhibition of the images so they can be viewed in a gallery. \nClick through the gallery above to see Avi's work. \nFollow Liz Connor on Twitter @Lizconnor_ More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:14:56.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
