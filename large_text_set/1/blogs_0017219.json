James Mattis as Defense Secretary Posted at 6:05 pm on January 20, 2017 by Greg P. \nGeneral James Mattis was confirmed as the next Secretary of Defense on Friday by a vote of 98-1: Mattis confirmation vote currently at 98-1. Apparently missing vote is……..Sessions. \n— Olivier Knox (@OKnox) January 20, 2017 \nFinal approval was held up for a little bit as the Senators attempted to “work a deal” on Donald Trump’s nominee to head the CIA, Rep. Mike Pompeo: Senate vote on Mattis still not final, because Senators are trying work a deal on a vote for Pompeo (CIA) \n— Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) January 20, 2017 \nWe’ll have to wait until Monday for the Pompeo vote: McConnell proposes 6 hours of debate on Monday on CIA nomination (Pompeo) – that's agreed to \n— Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) January 20, 2017 \nSen. Sessions ended up not voting: Sen. Gillibrand is the sole \"no\" vote on Gen. Mattis for Defense Secretary, and Sen. Sessions did not vote, per @AliABCNews . https://t.co/dyEHMYDrBk \n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) January 20, 2017 Sen. Jeff Sessions, AG nominee, did not vote on Mattis nomination https://t.co/IN73cCszV9 \n— CQ Now (@CQnow) January 20, 2017 \nSecretary Mattis is the first of President Trump’s nominees to get confirmed by the Senate. Now only 689 more to go: Senate confirms James Mattis as defence secretary, making him the 1st of president Trump's 30 noms to be appointed. 689 confirmations to go. \n— Matt Kwong (@matt_kwong) January 20, 2017 \nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand of NY was the sole no vote. Of note, she was appointed to fill the vacancy left by Hillary Clinton when she was confirmed as Secretary of State in 2009: Sen. Gillibrand the first \"no\" vote on Mattis confirmation for Defense; current tally is 95-1 \n— CQ Now (@CQnow) January 20, 2017 Gillibrand (D-NY) voted no. She had objected to waiving legal requirement that military be out of office 7 years before being eligible. \n— Olivier Knox (@OKnox) January 20, 2017 \nOr maybe she’s still mad that her candidate got beat?
