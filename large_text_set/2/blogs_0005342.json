If I was in your position, I wouldn't ask the manager. I would just say and write what I see, what I think. \n\"Game after game, I would just write what is happening every game with us. If not every game, almost every game. If I speak, I am punished. I don't want to be punished. \n\"Maybe your industry is going in another direction but, for me, journalism is to tell the truth. If you see what happened against Manchester City, Burnley, West Ham Stoke -- almost everywhere -- you do your job and you do a public service. \n\"Tell the truth. Don't ask me questions I cannot answer. You know I am different. The rules for me are different. I watch my team play in a hotel, forbidden to go in a stadium, my assistant had a stadium ban. \n\"Yesterday, one manager was told by the fourth official, 'I love your emotion and, because I love your emotion, no problem.' Today I was told to sit down or I have to sit in the stands.\" \nArindam is ESPN FC's Manchester United correspondent.
