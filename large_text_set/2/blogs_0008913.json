Photo by Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net National University sustained its strong play to stay atop the standings after brushing off Adamson University, 25-15, 25-22, 25-19, in the UAAP Season 79 women’s volleyball tournament Sunday at Filoil Flying V Centre in San Juan. The Lady Bulldogs are now at 3-0, separating themselves from University of the Philippines and De La Salle University, who sit in second place at 2-0. Adamson, meanwhile, crashed to its third straight loss in as many games. ADVERTISEMENT Jorelle Singh calmly finished things off for the Lady Bulldogs who ended the set without Jaja Santiago on the floor. Despite the win, NU head coach Roger Gorayeb wanted to see more from his team especially in terms of maintaining their aggressiveness against the Lady Falcons. “They were very relaxed in the second set, and I think it’s because they were facing Adamson who hasn’t won yet,” said Gorayeb. “And I really want to stop that way of thinking.” NU was also without setter Jasmine Nabor in the third set as she sat on the bench after complaining about a sore left knee. Gorayeb said there’s a benign tumor just above Nabor’s left knee and he decided to play backup setter Larni Aberin in the final set. “It was a previous injury she suffered way back in high school, it healed back then but it came back,” said Gorayeb. “This is the first time I’ve known about it.” Despite sitting out most of the third set, Jaja Santiago still led all scorers with 15 while Aiko Urdas and Singh combined for 15 points for NU. Jema Galanza led the Lady Falcons with 10 points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:43:47.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
