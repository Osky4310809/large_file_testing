PTI Photo \nThree RSS activists were allegedly attacked by CPI(M) workers at a village near Koyilandy, police said on Sunday. The victims, who are in their 20s, were admitted to the Medical College Hospital with injuries to their hands and legs. No arrests have been made in connection with Saturday night attack at Keezhaiyur village, police added. \nKerala has been witnessing a series of political clashes between cadres of BJP-RSS and ruling CPI(M), especially in the northern Kannur district, for a long time. Both parties have blamed each other for the cycle of violence, which has claimed several lives on both sides. Earlier this week, Kundan Chandravat, ‘Sah Prachar Pramukh’ of RSS in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain, announced a Rs 1 crore bounty for beheading Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “You have killed 300 pracharaks and activists, we will present Bharat Mata with a garland of 300,000 skulls in return,” he said at a meeting. \nChandravat, however, retracted his statement after he allegedly received death threats. “I was pained on the issue of murders of Swayamsevaks and therefore made an emotional statement. I retract it (statement) and express my regret,” Chandravat said in a statement. “I also got some phone calls from Kerala in which an unidentified caller threatened to kill me,” he claimed. \nThe RSS was quick to condemn Chandravat’s statement, stating the organisation did not believe in violence. “The RSS strongly condemns such statement. The Sangh does not believe in violence. But we will continue to protest against attacks on our workers in Kerala in a democratic and peaceful manner,” RSS national ‘Sah Prachar Pramukh’ (Joint Chief of Publicity) J Nandakumar had told PTI in Delhi. \nWith inputs from PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T08:59:46.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
