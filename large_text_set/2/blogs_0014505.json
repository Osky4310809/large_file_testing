An expressive tail or other body part could be a cheap way to add human computer interaction without the cost of a speaker or microphone. Obviously this presupposes that future robots would be so ubiquitous that we’d have “cheap” and “expensive” ones but, as the toy market shows us, even the most rudimentary beeps, boops, and giggles can make us fall in love with our Furbies, Pleos, and Hatchimals. \nIn fact, the folks at the University of Manitoba, are using “visual cues” to signal human users via live video feeds, increasing the probability that they notice important information before it’s too late. The department is also working actively on improving empathy in robots and recently tested whether a simulated, on-screen robot was more empathy-inducing than a real one. The result? People felt sorry for real robots far more than they felt sorry for on-screen ones. \nI, for one, welcome our empathy-inducing fluffy-tailed robotic overlords. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:23:22.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
