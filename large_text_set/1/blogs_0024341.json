Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSpencer Pratt and Heidi Montag have been evicted from the Celebrity Big Brother house after facing off against just one other housemate. \nSpeidi was the second eviction of the night, just an hour after Jessica was booted off. \nShe was sent home after fighting for votes against Bianca Gascoigne, Kim Woodburn, Jedward, Jessica Cunningham and the eternally nominated Speidi (Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag). \nThe crowd waiting outside the CBB house had booed most of the housemates when Emma Willis mentioned their names, with particularly loud jeering being reserved for Bianca Gascoigne following the revelation this week that she has a 'secret' boyfriend on the outside.

It's a really great honour,\" Jedward told the Diary Room. \n\"We've been saved because we're a different flavour - we bring blondness, we bring highlights... we bring intelligence.\" \n\"Thanks to the British public, I'm over the moon,\" said Bianca. Emma Willis revealed the voting was very tight for tonight's eviction (Photo: Channel 5) The crowd had booed all the housemates earlier in the show - especially Bianca (Photo: Channel 5) \nAsked by Emma what happened between her and Kim, Jessica said: \"I think she's alright, she went in there with a different persona. I just felt sorry for her as the other housemates didn't gel with her. \n\"She went in with all guns blazing, but none of them have bothered to sit down and have a conversation with her. I think she's isolated herself and she's going to struggle. \n\"If you don't have anyone to talk to and anything to occupy yourself with, the days are really long.\" \nIt's the second time a housemate was evicted this week, following Stacy's exit on Tuesday night.
