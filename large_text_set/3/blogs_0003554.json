She has always wanted to become an actress but unfortunately for her, daddy Dutt was against this and thought she’d have a much better life in the US. In an interview with HT, he spoke about Trishala’s career. She has done well and has specialized in forensic science and I think that’s a great thing to do. When asked about her acting plans, he added. Even if she wants to join the industry, she has to learn Hindi because American (English) will not work here. It is not easy to be an actor. It looks easy but it is quite difficult. Dutt is back to the grind and is shooting for Bhoomi, where he plays Aditi Rao Hydari’s on-screen father. Naturally, he was asked if there were any similarities between the his daughter and the character. Here’s what he said. \nYes, there are similarities but Trishala wanted to be an actress and I wanted to break her legs, which I’m not doing here! \nOuch! Looks like he absolutely detests the idea of her being in the limelight. 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T12:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:48:58.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
