Over the years and months before Steve Jobs took the stage at Macworld Expo 2007 to deliver his masterpiece keynote, many tried to guess exactly what the company was up to. As a nostalgic long-time follower of Apple rumors, I thought I’d compile some of the gossip that led up to the announcement of the “Jesus Phone”. The following links all point to MacRumors , which — along with Daring Fireball  — I’ve followed via RSS for about 13 years. It has managed to stay alive, relevant, and relatively low on broken links, in contrast to every other Apple rumor site. 2002 The earliest instance of an iPhone rumor I could find was a New York Times article linked by MacRumors that nailed 2 things: the ‘iPhone’ name, and the use of (née) Mac OS X for some sort of PDA/phone device. 2006 While some rumors in 2006 mentioned a phone, they focused on the idea of an “iPod phone”—a phone with a click-wheel. The more interesting rumors were about a “true video iPod”, an iPod equipped with a touchscreen that would be almost as big as its front face. Almost nobody made the connection back then. It’s really interesting how, at the time, trademark and domain name registrations, plus patents with crude drawings, were some of the best sources we could get for Apple predictions. There were no part leaks, like we have today. Also, 2006 was probably the peak year for fake photoshopped Apple prototypes, which was super fun. 2006 kicked off with Apple rumors from Steve Jobs himself! “Isn’t it funny? A ship that leaks from the top.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T06:15:57.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
