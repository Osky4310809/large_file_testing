In case you’re curious, this is how celebrities practice announcing the Oscar winners , according to People .\nThough all the presenters had their own ways of practicing at the February 25th rehearsal, there was a common theme: From what we saw, they were dressed in ordinary, everyday clothes. It makes sense that they’re saving their “Sunday best” for Sunday, aka today, for the actual Oscars. And, of course, we’re excited to see what dresses and outfits they wear !\nICYMI, Jimmy Kimmel is hosting the Oscars , and we can’t wait . Of course, he has a ton of experience being on stage (every night!) in front of tons of people, but we’re guessing he, too, has to rehearse for the Oscars.\nSo what were the celebrities’ methods of Oscar-presenting at the rehearsal? Were they serious? More casual? Here’s what we learned.\nEmma Stone & Ryan Gosling \nNaturally, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling will present together, and both were casual and jokey at rehearsal, according to People . Stone had her hair pulled back and was in jeans while Gosling had on a baseball cap.\n“Oh jeez!” Stone said when realizing the mic was on and that her words were going through the Dolby Theatre. Gosling replied with, “Hot mic!” as he leaned into it, to which Stone said, “Sibilance!” Cuuuute. After a few minutes of rehearsal, they were done, hugged goodbye, and left. We wonder if the pair will break into a dance number at the Oscars as they so easily did in La La Land ? A girl can hope, right?!\nJennifer Aniston \nAt the rehearsal, Jennifer Aniston was casually dressed, too, in blue jeans cuffed above “sparkly sling-back heels” and her glasses.\n“Walk, walk, walk,” Aniston said to herself as she practiced moving to the mic, reported People . While we don’t have the scoop on how all the presenters rehearsed or joked around, we do have a few more, along with some behind-the-scenes photos.\n\nDakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan Christopher Polk/Getty Images We’re sure Johnson and Doman had chemistry even at the rehearsal! She, too, got off script and looked to see where she’d be sitting at the actual ceremony.\nApparently, during the rehearsal, Johnson looked at the orchestra and said, “Oh my god, I’m in the corner!” Chris Evans Christopher Polk/Getty Images Chris Evans was in on the wearing-jeans game, too, with black jeans and a baseball cap. He seemed to get excited when he saw his photo on an orchestra seat placard.\n“I’m right there!” he said. Amy Adams Christopher Polk/Getty Images Amy Adams brought her 6-year-old daughter, Aviana, along. They both had on matching sweatshirts that read “Good Vibes Only” on them. Awww. They smiled at each other while Adams was onstage. Then, after practicing her lines, cuteness alert: Adams has Aviana come up to the stage. Aviana stumbles a bit on the stairs.\n“Her and Jennifer Lawrence !” Adams said. Hah!\nWe don’t know about you, but we ~love~ to see actors casual and in their everyday wear. And from what we heard, they seem all set for presenting tonight! Of course, the Oscars are on soooon, at 5:30 P.S.T./8:30 E.S.T. on ABC, so we’d better go get ready!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:46:45.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
