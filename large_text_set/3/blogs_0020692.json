Photo: MKBHD/YouTube \nWhile the rest of us are going to have to wait for preorders to open on March 24, lucky YouTuber Marques Brownlee, a.k.a. MKBHD , has already gotten his hands on the newly-announced (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 Plus. And, wouldn’t you know it, he’s treated the world to an unboxing video. Check it out below.\nAs Brownlee notes, this is the first (PRODUCT)RED iPhone in history, and is pretty exciting for that reason. (For a look at some of the other RED products in Apple’s history, check out our roundup here .) \nOn account of its charitable element — due to a portion of each sale going to help fight HIV/AIDs — he even gives it a pass on what would otherwise look like a mid-cycle cash grab to squeeze some more sales out of a handset that’s only got six months left as the premiere Apple handset. \nBrownlee also gushes over its colors, claiming that its matte design makes it the “most photogenic phone [he’s] seen in a long time.” He claims this is less likely to show fingerprints. \nIt’s not perfect though, he suggests. Like a lot of folks on Twitter, Brownlee questions Apple’s decision to opt for a white face for the iPhone, instead of giving it the black frontage seen on some other iPhone 7 models. He also suggests the silver ring around the Touch ID button could have been turned red to echo the color of the phone’s back. \nStill, it seems that the (PRODUCT)RED iPhone is already racking up fans, despite a few minor quibbles. \nAre you planning the buy the handset when it goes on sale?
