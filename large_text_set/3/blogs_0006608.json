Redline is named not only for the Metro line that runs through downtown but also for the Red Car, the original light rail in L.A. “We named it Redline after the transit systems because that’s what brings people together and is a big part of building a community,” co-owner Oliver Alpuche explains. \nRedline doubles as both a low-key bar/restaurant and crowded nightclub. I highly recommend getting to the bar before the kitchen closes at 9 p.m., as we did, because the food is incredible. Highlights of head chef (and CIA graduate) Justin Schwartz's menu include handmade empanadas with rib-eye, shredded chicken or mushroom, the roasted chicken and artichoke flatbread, and a poutine made with garlic cheese curds, duck confit and duck gravy. While Redline's drink menu is a bit more limited than Bar Mattachine's, the cocktails are still not your average gay bar well drinks. The Orange Bloom, a vodka drink featuring fresh OJ, was especially tasty. \nBy 10 p.m., the tables had been cleared and the music turned up. By the time the drag show featuring RuPaul’s Drag Race season-three winner Raja Gemini began close to midnight, the dance floor was packed and the Redline had indeed transitioned to a full-on club. The Boulet Brothers host Queen Kong every Friday at Precinct. Jeremy Lucido \nOur dancing shoes now warmed up, we headed next to Precinct , about a 10-minute walk. Co-owner Thor Stephens describes it as a “rock & roll gay bar, [where] everyone’s welcome.” Before Precinct opened as a bustling gay club in May 2015, the building that houses it was a parole office. “People assume [Precinct is] a cop-themed bar, but it basically means a neighborhood section of town with a community,” Stephens says. \nAs the largest gay establishment downtown, Precinct can get crowded, sometimes with a line around the corner. The influx of customers could be due to its popular themed nights and performers. Every Friday, the Boulet Brothers host Queen Kong, a drag night that features some of the most popular talent around. Themes rotate on Saturday nights and include bear and Latin nights, the latter being the theme on the night we went. \nThe dance floor at Precinct was huge but completely packed. The crowd was definitely feeling the music as go-go dancers shook their booties around the room. The drinks weren’t as fancy as the craft cocktails from earlier, but by the time we reached Precinct, the well drinks did their job just fine. Precinct also offers a decent menu of food, which definitely satisfied our \"drunchies\" — the kind of food perfect for eating when trying to sober up at 1 in the morning (the kitchen is open until 1:30 a.m.). The grilled cheese and sirloin steak (yes, steak at 1 a.m.) were especially delicious. The New Jalisco Timothy Norris \nAs last call was approaching fast, our final stop of the packed evening was at the New Jalisco , only four blocks from Precinct. This LGBT Mexican bar is definitely a dive bar in every sense of the term, and is cash only. The drinks were pretty strong and perfect for our nightcap. While the New Jalisco may not be as fancy as the newer gay establishments, you can feel the history pulsing throughout the building. After a round or two, it was definitely time to call it a night as we summoned our Lyfts to head home.
