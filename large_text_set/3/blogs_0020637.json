The 40-year-old actor visited The Late Show for Tuesday night’s episode where he laid outside on a blanket with host Stephen Colbert and pondered life… literally. “Hey Steven, what’s the meaning of life?” Reynolds asked. “Well, I suppose it’s that we’re all here to do good work and treat one another…” Colbert began. “No, no, I meant my new movie, Life , do you know what it’s about?” Reynolds quipped. “You don’t know what it’s about?” Colbert questioned. “Oh, I never read any of my scripts unless there’s lots and lots of pictures, love pictures!” Reynolds said. The conversation between the two was pretty deep, with Colbert asking where they all go after death. “I don’t know about you, but I’m going to Canadian heaven,” the Canadian actor replied. When asked about the different between Canadian and American heaven, Reynolds replied, “Well, Canadian heaven is real and American heaven is inside the body of Toby Keith.” WATCH: EXCLUSIVE: Ryan Reynolds Says Fatherhood Has Made Him 'More Desperate': 'There's Just No Time Anymore' And the Life star also wasn’t afraid to mock his 2011 superhero flop Green Lantern . Reynolds asked Colbert what super power he’d like to have, to which the host replied, “I’d like to have this super cool alien high tech ring, and it’s green and it has a lantern on it and I can use my imagination to make anything out of green light.” “That’s a really dumb superpower,” Reynolds replied. Though he loves having a good time, sometimes Reynolds’ antics can get him in trouble on set.
