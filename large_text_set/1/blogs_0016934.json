Marco Rubio, R-Fla., explained why the nomination of Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State makes him uneasy. \nFirst, Rubio is uncomfortable with Tillerson’s refusal to condemn Russia on certain matters. The senator also explained that Tillerson does not seem to share Rubio’s passion in protecting human rights in nations such as China, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia.

Those concerns were also visible when Rubio pressed Tillerson during Tillerson’s confirmation hearing. However, in the end Rubio said he would bend for Tillerson despite misgivings.

Therefore, despite my reservations, I will support Mr. Tillerson’s nomination in committee and in the full Senate,” Rubio said in summation, adding that, “However, upcoming appointments to critical posts in the Department of State are not entitled to and will not receive from me the same level of deference I have given this nomination.” \nRubio’s comments included what could be read as a jab at Trump, who defeated Rubio in the GOP presidential primary and who has promised “great deals” as president. \n”… today there are calls to move our foreign policy in a direction that views geopolitics as a series of deals to be made, even if they come at the expense of our values or require us to abandon our traditional allies,” he wrote.

He has an impressive record of leadership and the proven ability to manage a large and complex organization,” Rubio said. \nHe also made a point to note what he liked about Tillerson’s comments during the confirmation process. \n“He acknowledged that Russia conducted a campaign of active measures designed to undermine our elections. He stated that Russia’s taking of Crimea was illegal and illegitimate. … He accurately characterized the conflict in eastern Ukraine as a Russian invasion, and he supports providing defensive weapons to Ukraine,” Rubio continued. \nBut other parts of Tillerson’s testimony was “troubling,” Rubio wrote. \n“While he condemned Russia for ‘supporting Syrian forces that brutally violate the laws of war,’ he refused to publicly acknowledge that Vladimir Putin has committed war crimes,” Rubio wrote, also objecting to Tillerson’s comments that he did not have enough information about the murders of Putin’s political opponents to lay them at the Russian leader’s door. \n“He indicated he would support sanctions on Putin for meddling in our elections only if they met the impossible condition that they not affect U.S. businesses operating in Russia,” he added, also noting his dislike for Tillerson’s position on maintaining sanctions against Russia. \nRubio then summed up his thoughts. \n“Mr. Tillerson is likely to have a potentially unprecedented level of influence over the direction of our foreign policy. I remain concerned that in the years to come, our country will not give the defense of democracy and human rights the priority they deserve, and will pursue a foreign policy that too often sets aside our values and our historic alliances in pursuit of flawed geopolitical deals,” he wrote. \n“But in making my decision on his nomination, I must balance these concerns with his extensive experience and success in international commerce, and my belief that the president is entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet,” Rubio added.
