Congressional Republicans aren’t keen on a drawn-out fight over the wall, and would rather make a deal with the Democrats to avoid a shutdown, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. \nOther topics broached at the meeting included: Whether or not to turn deactivated border cameras; protecting free speech on college campuses; and reversing the OPM rule that exempts members of Congress from Obamacare. \nThe White House official confirmed that these topics were broached at the meeting, but said that the White House staffers in attendance mostly sat back and took notes. \nDiscussion of health care was largely absent from the meeting, with the exception of possibly reversing Congress’ exemption from Obamacare, the source said. \nWhite House conservative liaison Paul Teller organized the meeting, which was attended by representatives from conservative groups including the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Limited Government and Judicial Watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:24:22.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
