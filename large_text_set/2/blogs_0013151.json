All Plants Absorb Carbon Dioxide, but Trees are Best \nWhile all living plant matter absorbs CO 2 as part of photosynthesis, trees process significantly more than smaller plants due to their large size and extensive root structures. In essence, trees, as kings of the plant world, have much more “woody biomass” to store CO 2 than smaller plants, and as a result are considered nature’s most efficient “carbon sinks”.It is this characteristic which makes planting trees a form of climate change mitigation . \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), tree species that grow quickly and live long are ideal carbon sinks. Unfortunately, these two attributes are usually mutually exclusive. Given the choice, foresters interested in maximizing the absorption and storage of CO 2 (known as “ carbon sequestration ”) usually favor younger trees that grow more quickly than their older cohorts. However, slower growing trees can store much more carbon over their significantly longer lives. Plant the Right Tree for the Right Location \nScientists are busy studying the carbon sequestration potential of different types of trees in various parts of the U.S., including Eucalyptus in Hawaii, loblolly pine in the Southeast, bottomland hardwoods in Mississippi, and poplars (aspens) in the Great Lakes region. \n“There are literally dozens of tree species that could be planted depending upon location, climate and soils,” says Stan Wullschleger, a researcher at Tennessee’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory who specializes in the physiological response of plants to global climate change. Choose Low-Maintenance Trees to Maximize Carbon Absorption \nDave Nowak, a researcher at the U.S. Forest Service’s Northern Research Station in Syracuse, New York has studied the use of trees for carbon sequestration in urban settings across the United States. A 2002 study he co-authored lists the Common Horse-chestnut, Black Walnut , American Sweetgum, Ponderosa Pine, Red Pine, White Pine, London Plane, Hispaniolan Pine, Douglas Fir, Scarlet Oak, Red Oak, Virginia Live Oak and Bald Cypress as examples of trees especially good at absorbing and storing CO 2 . Nowak advises urban land managers to avoid trees that require a lot of maintenance, as the burning of fossil fuels to power equipment like trucks and chainsaws will only erase the carbon absorption gains otherwise made. Plant Any Tree Appropriate for Region and Climate to Offset Global Warming \nUltimately, trees of any shape, size or genetic origin help absorb CO 2 . Most scientists agree that the least expensive and perhaps easiest way for individuals to help offset the CO 2 that they generate in their everyday lives is to plant a tree…any tree, as long as it is appropriate for the given region and climate. \nThose who wish to help larger tree planting efforts can donate money or time to the National Arbor Day Foundation or American Forests in the U.S., or to the Tree Canada Foundation in Canada . \nEarthTalk is a regular feature of E/The Environmental Magazine.
