The last time the Dow fell nine days in a row was in 1978. The Dow's 8-day losing streak is the longest since August 2011. https://t.co/4hWGtXqMki pic.twitter.com/Hp1Xka8SQx — MarketWatch (@MarketWatch) March 28, 2017 \nThe Dow ended its worst week in five months the day the GOP pulled its bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Many on Wall Street saw the failure of the president’s first major legislative effort as an indication that Trump’s tax reform regulations and infrastructure could suffer the same fate. \nMichael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading, said the recent selloff was a “ knee-jerk reaction ” to the \" shocking reality that President Trump can't snap his fingers and get business and stock friendly policies enacted, ” according to CNN .
