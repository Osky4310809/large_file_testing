David Benavidez moved to 17-0 with another impressive win \nIt took just 50 seconds of the second to finish the job, a brilliant combination of two lefts downstairs, a right to the head and then a perfect left hook, forcing the second knockdown. \nMamajonov did well to get up, only for referee Russell Mora to wave it off. Ivan Redkach (r) stopped Demond Brock in the final round \nIvan Redkach returned to winning ways with a last-round stoppage of Demond Brock. \nThe Ukrainian lightweight had a draw and a defeat in his last two fights and was given a tough time by the American known as 'Body Shot'. \nRedkach landed the clearer punches early on, but spent a large chunk on the ropes, and had to dig deep to force the stoppage before the final bell.
