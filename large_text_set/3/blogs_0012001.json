By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 15, 2017 9:58 AM Google Doodle paid a tribute to Test cricket on Wednesday for completing 140 years. \nAs cricketing fans set eye on the third Test match between India and Australia which is scheduled to begin on 16th March, Google paid a special tribute to the format. The Google Doodle team have created a funny imagery to remember the first official Test match played between Australia and England which started on 15th March 1887 and finished on 19th March. This historic game was played at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground as the newly formed Australian side defeated the well-established England team by 45 runs. \nHowever, the English side pulled off an inspirational comeback in the second match and levelled the series 1-1. Least did people know back then that cricket will turn out to be a worldwide phenomenon with England and Australia taking the centre stage through their rivalry. A Test was played between these two-sided from 12th to 17th March 1977 to mark 100 years of Test cricket where the Aussies once again defeated England by 45 runs. \nAccording to the official statement, “Today’s Doodle hits the deck with a lighthearted rendering that captures the spirit of sportsmanship and the inaugural test match. Moustachioed and musclebound, the batsmen, bowlers and opposition fielders spring into action, never losing sight of the red ball.” \nWatch the journey of Test cricket: \nAustralia cricket team led by Steve Smith is currently in India to participate in the ongoing four-match Test series. The visitors surprised everyone with an incredible 333-run victory in Pune but Virat Kohli ’s men were quick to react and levelled the series at Bengaluru by winning the second Test by 45-runs. The action now shifts to Ranchi and keeping a lid on emotion will be nearly as important as executing game plans for both the sides. \nThe Australia captain’s glance to the dressing room when he was deciding whether to review an umpiring decision drew an explosive response from his counterpart Virat Kohli, whom many consider more Australian in temperament than Indian. The cricket boards sprang to the defence of their respective captains and former players did their bit in fanning the fire until the International Cricket Council (ICC) stepped in to douse it.
