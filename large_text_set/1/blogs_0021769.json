This Paul Krugman-related shot & chaser is one for the ‘prediction fail’ time capsule Posted at 12:33 pm on January 25, 2017 by Doug P. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nNew York Times economist Paul Krugman has made no secret of his dislike for Donald Trump . Krugman has sounded many alarms about Trump, and none were louder than a prediction that his election would be disastrous for the market. That prediction, however, hasn’t matched up with reality: \"Even though this is my speciality\" pic.twitter.com/7TmfAYbgc7 \n— Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) January 25, 2017 \nClassic! \nThe shot, from Paul Krugman on election night : \nIt really does now look like President Donald J. Trump, and markets are plunging. When might we expect them to recover? \nFrankly, I find it hard to care much, even though this is my specialty. The disaster for America and the world has so many aspects that the economic ramifications are way down my list of things to fear. \nStill, I guess people want an answer: If the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never. \nAnd the chaser, today: BREAKING: Dow Jones industrial average eclipses 20,000 for the first time; cheers from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. \n— The Associated Press (@AP) January 25, 2017 \nIt’s almost like Krugman has no idea what he’s talking about. When you throw your expertise into the eternal dumpster fire of partisan hackery, people stop believing you. https://t.co/R0lHXAzUym \n— Michael Watson (@MichaelWatsonDC) January 25, 2017 Reality owned Krugman today like Cruz owned Deadspin yesterday. https://t.co/QlHvAgZcZq \nSo the only real question remaining is… Hi @paulkrugman Hey why are you still employed? \n— Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) January 25, 2017 \nHeh. \n— David Burge (@iowahawkblog) January 25, 2017 @iowahawkblog @redsteeze sadly @paulkrugman lost it all in the unexpected Fax Machine Collapse of the late 90s.. pic.twitter.com/Im6hKCkOVN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T21:27:56.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
