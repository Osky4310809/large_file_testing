Durant hyperextended his left knee and exited the Golden State Warriors’ game at the Washington Wizards for good after all of 93 seconds Tuesday night. AP PHOTO \nWASHINGTON—Kevin Durant suffered an injury scare as the Golden State Warriors slumped to a 112-108 defeat against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday. \nWarriors star Durant limped out of the game in the first quarter at Washington’s Verizon Center after team-mate Zaza Pachulia fell awkwardly onto his left leg. \nThe Warriors later confirmed Durant had suffered a hyperextended left knee and that an MRI scan had been scheduled. There was no further information about the Warriors’ All-Star’s long-term condition. ADVERTISEMENT \nIt was an unhappy homecoming of sorts for Durant, who grew up in the nearby Maryland suburbs and who had been courted by the Wizards during his free agency last year before choosing to join the Warriors. \nThat snub clearly still rankles with some Washington fans, who subjected Durant to boos during the introduction and whenever he touched the ball. \nThe Wizards took full advantage of Durant’s absence to claim a narrow victory that saw them improve to 35-23 in the Eastern Conference Standings. \nBradley Beal led the scoring for the Wizards with 25 points, three assists and four rebounds. \nMarkieff Morris added 22 points, six rebounds and one assist. Guard John Wall also shone, with 12 points, 19 assists and six rebounds. \nNBA MVP Stephen Curry led the scoring for the Warriors with 25 points, seven rebounds and four assists. \nKlay Thompson (16), Draymond Green (14), Shaun Livingston (14) and Pachulia with 12 also made double-figures for the Western Conference leaders, who have already booked their place in the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T07:00:03.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
