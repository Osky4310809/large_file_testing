BuzzFeed had no such compunction, publishing the full, unverified document from a person purporting to be a former British intelligence agent. \nIn a tweet , BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith posted an internal email that explained his logic for posting the documents, which had been known to several journalists and politicians for some time. Smith wrote that BuzzFeed’s “presumption is to be transparent in our journalism and to share what we have with our readers,” saying the site has “always erred on the side of publishing.” Also Read: Here's Why 'Golden Showers' Is Trending (Yes, It Involves Trump) \nSmith said the file “was in wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and media,” and that it seemed to be the underpinning of allegations from outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid that the FBI was sitting on “explosive information” about the ties between Trump and Russia. \nHere’s Smith’s email in full, from his Twitter feed: Here's the note I sent to @buzzfeednews staff this evening pic.twitter.com/OcAloWzVzb \n— Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 11, 2017 \nPolitico reporter Ken Vogel tweeted that he had been investigating the “golden shower” claim himself, but the political news site couldn’t corroborate it, which is why it refrained from publishing. To be clear: we couldn't corroborate the story, which is why we didn't publish anything. Not because this particular part seemed doubts. https://t.co/sEpgY2deXb \n— Kenneth P.

But before her, there were many others who fell victim -- some were even called the \"O\" word more than once.
