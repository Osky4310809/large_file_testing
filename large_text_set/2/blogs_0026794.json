A loyal customer congratulates Singh for his successful business, for which Singh credits his children. ADVERTISEMENT \n“That’s wonderful, you have very worthy sons,” the customer commends again. But Singh corrects him and says, “Not sons…but daughters.” \nThe commercial ends with a dynamic quote about gender equality and modern-day feminism at a time when women’s achievements and capabilities are still undervalued in India. “Success doesn’t differentiate between a boy and a girl. It’s the thinking that matters,” the clip ended. BACKSTORY: ‘Three Idiots’ star becomes father through surrogacy \nIt may appear to be a brief 50-second skit, but Khan’s ad has stirred unflagging kudos from Indian netizens and has now been streamed 2.8 million times on YouTube and 6 million on Khan’s Facebook page . \nYears after the box office triumph of “Three Idiots,” Khan, 51, continues to bag critical roles in Bollywood films and soap operas.
