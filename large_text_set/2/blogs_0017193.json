During that time they contacted the concerned friend. \nThe call was graded as “significant”, meaning officers must arrive on scene within 60 minutes. \nHowever regulations state they should attend as soon as possible, according to the IPCC. It added that the call handlers had no cases to answer. Police watchdog investigates Met Police 'deleted files' claims \nColin Dewar, who headed the IPCC investigation, said they had \"established a significant delay between the officers accepting the call and attending Ms Begum's home.\" \nHe added: \"It will now be a matter for a panel to determine whether or not the response of the officers breached the standards of professional behaviour.\" \nThe hearing will take place in London on February 27 and 28.
