It turns out that the Alcatel brand was among the assets owned by the French company when Nokia announced its acquisition.Clearly, that means that after the acquisition the Alcatel smartphone brand would belong to Nokia . However, the Finnish company did not mention anything about the brand one year ago after it bought Alcatel-Lucent.It was only recently that Nokia confirmed that when it acquired Alcatel-Lucent, it learned that the Alcatel brand was licensed to Chinese company TCL, the same that owns the license to launch BlackBerry-branded phones , for many years. The Alcatel brand was licensed by Alcatel-Lucent to TCL for mobile phones and devices and this license expires at the end of 2024. When Nokia acquired the assets of Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, this also included licensing agreements for the Alcatel brand. The above statement comes from Nokia and confirms TCL has the license to launch Alcatel smartphones and tablets for seven more years. So, more money for Nokia, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:38:51.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
