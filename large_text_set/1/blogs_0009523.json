The funds for the increase would be covered by current contributions and the investment reserve fund, officials added. \nIn an interview, Dooc said they had recommended a P500 increase but the P1,000 figure would turn out to be the compromise rate, with economic managers opposing moves for government subsidy. He said the increase would reflect in the February pension. \nAsked why there was no prior consultation with SSS contributors, Dooc said the SSS is a tripartite body which has commissioners who represent members. Tax reform can wait \nDooc said economic managers have deemed it necessary for the rate increase to be implemented by May, without waiting for the government to act on the proposed income tax reform package for employees that aims to reduce the income tax rate from 32 percent to 25 percent. \nBudget Secretary Benjamin Diokno earlier said in a briefing that any increase in SSS contribution would be viable after Congress approves an income tax reform law possibly by 2018. \nValdez and Dooc also vowed to go after erring firms who fail to properly pay or remit the contributions of their employees. The SSS officials, however, did not say how many companies they would be going after, even as they urged Congress to help them in issuing condonation packages to delinquent employers. \nThe SSS is also proposing amendments to its charter. \nBy May 2017, the SSS will impose a 1.5 percent contribution rate increase or 12.5 percent from the current 11 percent contribution rate. \nIn peso value, the additional total contribution will range from P15 to P740, equally shared by the employer and the employee. The proper perspective is to view the SSS contribution as long-term savings, and not as an expense, officials added. \nEarlier, three “leftist” members of the Cabinet called on President Duterte to implement as soon as possible the P2,000 increase in the monthly SSS pension. \nChallenging the position of Duterte’s economic managers, secretaries Judy Taguiwalo of the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Rafael Mariano of the Department of Agrarian Reform and Liza Maza of the National Anti-Poverty Commission said the President should honor his promise to raise the SSS pension by P2,000. \nIn a position paper presented during a Cabinet meeting Monday night, the three secretaries said the commitment made by the “candidate” Duterte was a covenant with the public that he is bound to uphold. \nThe statement was in reference to a previous remark of Diokno that candidate Duterte is different from President Duterte. \nDiokno and other economic managers earlier recommended that Duterte turn down proposals to raise the SSS pension. \nWithout an increase in contribution rates, the budget chief warned that SSS may face bankruptcy as more funds would end up as pension for retirees. \nBut in their position paper, the three secretaries maintained that the equation should not be limited between pension hikes and contribution rates. \n“The SSS pension fund is not built only through membership contribution by its members. It is also built by prudent investment of the fund in financial instruments that bring yields which exceed at least the inflation rate and the true cost of living for the pensioners,” they said. Fear tactics \nThey said pensioners should not be held hostage by fear tactics “comprised mostly of the unfounded argument that the fund will go bankrupt if a benefit long due to them is given.” \n“SSS fund managers over the years have demonstrated consistently their readiness to losing billions of pesos in taking bets on how their asset placements would perform, but express extreme pessimism whenever initiatives to improve the lot of the pensioners are considered,” they added. \nThe secretaries challenged the economic managers to have the political will to address the inefficiencies of SSS, stressing the need for other ways to raise funds to cover the pension hike without increasing the contribution of members. \nIn addition to the passage of the pension hike, they also pushed for a review and reform of the SSS governance and fund management program, citing a loss of placements amounting to P24.5 billion last year. \nThey urged Duterte to order the evaluation of the SSS loan and investment portfolio and enforce an effective asset recovery program. \n“Inappropriately created loans should be paid by those who benefited from them and criminal charges should be filed and earnestly pursued,” they said. \n“(He should also) order the SSS governing body to immediately undertake a program that will address collection efficiency, prudent but optimal fund investment program and earnest commitment to serve the pensioners’ welfare as social investors,” added the secretaries. \nCiting a recent report of the Commission on Audit (COA), the secretaries cited the need to recover investments in closed, non-existing or unlisted companies worth P823 million; and to collect delinquent premium contributions amounting to P4.845 billion. \nCOA also noted the existence of idle assets amounting to P17.95 billion with foregone revenues of P198 million as of 2014, as well as net understatement of total assets by P9.94 billion and of reserves by P11.34 billion in 2015. \n“A change in perspective is a prerequisite to fulfill President Duterte’s promise to SSS pensioners,” said the three Cabinet members. \n“Let this government continuously show its care for the elderly and the poor. They who have cared for us in our formative and dependent years should be accorded our full support. This is our time to pay forward,” they added.
