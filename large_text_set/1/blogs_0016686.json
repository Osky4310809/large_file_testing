Lewis, a great American in Congress still and in the news for all the wrong reasons this weekend — but said he couldn’t afford the trip. \nDr. Wilson said he would front them both the money. They drove to Washington from Claymont, Del., and stayed at a motel on New York Ave. The day before the rally they were at the National Mall, walking around, taking in the sights and imagining, Raveling says, what tomorrow would look like and sound like. \nRaveling is 6’4” and Warren Wilson was 6’3”, and someone asked them if they wanted to work security at the podium the next day. \nRaveling said, “They just liked that we were big, in case there was any trouble. We even had to learn the exit plan if there was. One of the first things they showed us was the escape route.” \nRaveling said that all of the speakers, including Lewis, there as the president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, were asked to keep their speeches to five minutes, and submit them in advance. Some, he said, refused. \nOne of the reasons why the ending to Dr. King’s speech, the part about having a dream, the part that will once again become the soundtrack of America on Monday, was not included in his copy is because King was afraid it would look as if his speech would run too long. \n“But they wanted him to go at the end,” Raveling said. “They knew he would have the crowd in the palm of his hand.” George Raveling shows copy of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have A Dream\" speech. (George Raveling via YouTube) \nRaveling laughed and said, “I think John Lewis had to change his speech fifteen times.” \nThere was no trouble that day, just the thrill that ran through the crowd in front of King as the power in him kept building, as he spoke to the best of us, to the best America, five years before he became a victim of the worst of it — gun violence, the same as Robert F. Kennedy was a victim of gun violence that year. \nThen the speech was ending, and Dr. King’s voice was rising, as if to the heavens, and Mahalia Jackson, the gospel singer, was shouting, “Tell him about the dream, Martin.” And he did. \nAnd then it really was over, and Rev. King was coming down from the podium, papers in his hand, and George Raveling, the basketball kid from Villanova, said, “Dr. King, can I have it?” meaning the speech, and King simply handed it to him. \n“It was everything he believed,” Raveling said, “all the good he carried inside him, all the courage. It was Washington and Selma and Montgomery. All of it.” \nIn pictures from the day, as the benediction is being given, there is the young George Raveling, to the left of the podium. \nThe three pages, framed, are in a vault now, in Los Angeles, because Raveling’s wife began to worry about having a document like this in their house as more and more people came to know Raveling’s story from that day. George Raveling has had a fantastic life in basketball, but he was also able to witness one of the most fantastic moments in civil rights history. (Charles Krupa/AP) \nFor years he kept the pages inside a copy of President Harry Truman’s biography that Truman had signed for Raveling once, when he had come out to play an East-West All-Star Game in Kansas City and traveled to Independence, Mo., to meet Truman. \n“I knew I’d never lose the speech,” Raveling said, “because I was never going to lose a book Harry Truman had signed to me.” \nSo the book and the speech traveled with him across a life, and a basketball life. It was more than the speech, of course. It was the day, and the moment. It was having that speech delivered, by that man, right in front of him. It was being a part of history. \nRaveling thinks he first told a reporter about it when he got to Iowa. The reporter, excited, asked where it was. Raveling said, “In a box downstairs we haven’t unpacked yet.” They went downstairs. There it was. \n“You know something else I remember?” Raveling said. “I remember when we were driving back to Delaware. Seven at night. The thing’s been over for a couple of hours. And there’s still this traffic jam of cars trying to get back into Washington. Like they still wanted to be a part of the day, even though the day was over.” \nGeorge Raveling was asked what he thinks about, all this time later, when he hears the speech. What he will think about on Monday when he hears it again. \n“How close I was to majesty,” he said. “And how then it was in my hands.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T00:16:38.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
