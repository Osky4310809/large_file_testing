Dan-Ali; Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; Chief of Air Staff, Vice Marshal Sadique Abubakar and other operational commanders. \nHe said: “Camp Zero is the spiritual headquarters of Boko Haram, it doesn’t mean when you capture that all of them will disappear but it is significant because it was thought that the place was impenetrable. \n“Capturing Camp Zero is the end of the mission to capture the place, we are not saying the campaign is over but we have dominated Camp Zero.” \nOn his part, the Chief of Air Staff, Sadique Abubakar noted that the rescue of the Chibok girls and other abductees had been one of the major aims of the Nigerian military.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T10:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T07:47:48.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
