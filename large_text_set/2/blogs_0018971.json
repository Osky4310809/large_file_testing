As a result, we will continue with our efforts to provide consumers with a free of charge modification as quickly as possible. \n\"Trading Standards have also notified us that updated usage advice should be communicated to affected consumers. If your tumble dryer is affected by this issue then you should unplug it and do not use it until the modification has taken place. \" \nWhirlpool has also been advised to publicise the changed advice to consumers through advertisements in national newspapers, through social media and in stores. \nA spokesman at Electrical Safety First, said: “We welcome Whirlpool’s updated advice to consumers, although we would like to have seen this advice issued sooner. Since this safety notice was issued in November 2015, we have emphasised the importance of not using an affected machine due to the fire risk. \n\"Now, we would like to see more visible communication to reach out to those consumers who have yet to respond to the notice. Even with media coverage of devastating fires caused by these appliances, only 1.5 million affected customers have registered the fault which means many more people are still at risk”.
