And perhaps anyone that doesn't love cheesy jokes is in the same boat — maybe. Often reserved as an appetizer to hold you and your friends over until the main attraction arrives, nachos have grown into an attraction of their own. \nChefs and restaurateurs alike have taken notice of the rising popularity of this shareable and very social dish.
