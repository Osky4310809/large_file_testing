Anyone said uefalona yet? — Ed Malyon (@eaamalyon) March 8, 2017 The diving/gamesmanship also shameful etc etc. But, if you're fighting for the impossible, you have to push everything... — Miguel Delaney (@MiguelDelaney) March 9, 2017 \n“The truth is we have let a huge opportunity get away and we are aware of that. In the first-half it was more our fault than them playing well,” he said. \n“In the second-half it changed. The penalty (first penalty converted by Lionel Messi for 3-0) got them off to a great start, but I was already calmer because I could see the team was responding better, were better positioned on the pitch and could do damage. Paris Saint-Germain's Spanish headcoach Unai Emery (L).

Then in the last two minutes we lost everything we had recovered in the second-half.” \nPSG’s Qatari president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: “It’s a nightmare for everyone. Three goals in seven minutes is very difficult. Everybody is upset but now is not the time to talk about it.” \nFrench sports daily newspaper L’Equipe was in no doubt about the implications of the defeat. \n“Inqualifiable” (”Unspeakable”) was its front page headline for Thursday with its reporter claiming the entire “PSG project” was threatened by the “humiliation”. \nTHE CONTROVERSIES and NEAR MISSES THAT WILL HAUNT PSG La une de «L'Equipe» après l'incroyable exploit du Barça face au PSG https://t.co/O06KebXJSh pic.twitter.com/T5hlumooc9 — L'ÉQUIPE (@lequipe) March 9, 2017 \n10TH MINUTE: Mascherano handball? \nBarcelona dominated the opening stages but PSG’s Julian Draxler broke into their box and attempted to play a cross to a teammate in the centre. \nThe ball struck the outstretched arm of a sliding Javier Mascherano, but the referee turned down PSG’s penalty appeals.
