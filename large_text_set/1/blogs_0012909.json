Zhihu , launched two years after Quora, is now a startup “unicorn” after it secured US$100 million in series D funding.\nThe investment and valuation are today confirmed by Kai-Fu Lee, former Google China boss turned startup investor and an early backer of Zhihu, reports Technode .\n16 new startup unicorns emerged in Asia last year , fewer than in 2015. Of those, all but five were Chinese startups.\nQuora last raised funding in 2014. Zhihu, with 65 million registered users, of whom 18.5 million are daily active users, saw 6 million questions and 23 million answers in 2016.\nThe startup has managed to survive despite the onslaught of a tech giant. Baidu, China’s top search engine, has a Yahoo Answers-style section, but Zhihu has clung onto the intellectual mantle it forged by starting out focusing on tech and entrepreneurial topics. It generates revenue from accounts, ads, and Zhihu Live, in which users pay a fee for head-to-head sessions with top experts.\nQuora last raised funding in 2014, trousering US$80 million at a US$900 million valuation .\nPrevious investors Tencent, Sogou, SAIF Partners, Qiming Venture Partners, and Sinovation Ventures were joined by Capital Today in Zhihu’s bumper investment.\nThis post China’s answer to Quora now worth a billion bucks appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T15:01:50.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
