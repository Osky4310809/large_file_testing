Now LG has joined the herd and has announced that it will be hosting an event on February 26th at MWC, where the brand is expected to unveil the LG G6. \nLG’s invite for the event doesn’t mention anything about the device the brand is planning to unveil at the event. It just reads “See More, Play More”, which suggests a large display and a big battery. As per a recent teaser video, the phone will feature a big display in a compact body. \nLG’s Display subsidiary recently unveiled the world’s first 5.7-inch QHD+ LCD panel with an aspect ratio of 18 : 9 and minimal bezels. If the LG G6 utilises this, it will be a first for a smartphone. The brand has already said that the G6 will feature heat pipes to lower the temperature to ensure safety. The phone will come with a non-removable battery as it’s teased to be water-resistant. We will have more details about the phone in the coming weeks.
