(Photo: Splash News) More The Kardashian-Jenners have their own unique sense of style. They’re going to wear what they want when they want, and no one is going to stop them. However, there are certain circumstances in which a sheer top or booty shorts just don’t seem to be appropriate apparel. Take, for example, a business meeting. On Wednesday, Kylie Jenner was spotted in Beverly Hills, Calif. heading into an office wearing a white corset over a silky minidress. Since when is basically just skin considered appropriate work attire? Or is this the new power outfit in corporate America? Is Kylie Jenner ahead of the corporate America fashion curve? (Photo: Splash) More The corset showed off her tiny torso and was worn over a cream spaghetti strap slip dress with a plunging neckline. That must have been distracting to whoever she was wheeling and dealing with (unless it was Blac Chyna — or maybe her sisters). She was seen pulling at the hem of her skirt; maybe it hit her that it was a little too short for this event. However, there’s no way that dress will suddenly be made appropriate with a little tug. And it’s not like she paired the outfit with black pumps to give it a more professional look; she seems to have raided Kim Kardashian’s extensive shoe archive and found a pair of strappy silver heels to wear, making the look that much more random. She wore either a wig or extensions; her brown hair was almost as long as the dress — not hard to be. Kourtney Kardashian reunited with Justin Bieber for another Wednesday night church service in Los Angeles, Calif.(Photo: Maciel / AKM-GSI) More Kylie’s not the only member of the Kardashian-Jenner family just this week to break an unwritten dress code. Kourtney Kardashian attended nighttime prayer services with Justin Bieber Wednesday in a sheer top — seriously. The reality star wore a see-through black shirt that exposed her bra, a leather and shearling coat, slouchy olive pants, and Yeezy booties. Kim Kardashian leaves the Roosevelt Island Church on September 7, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Pierre Suu/GC Images) More Read More Perhaps Kourtney’s look was inspired by Kim’s? Back in September, the 35-year-old mother-of-two wore a very similar ensemble when she visited a church in New York wearing a sheer white turtleneck with matching baggy pants and lace-up boots. Khloe Kardashian and Kendall Jenner are seen at church for Easter in Los Angeles on April 05, 2015 in Los Angeles, Calif. (Photo: Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) More Well, at least Kendall Jenner knows to cover up for church. Oh, wait, she simply traded exposing her chest for stomach. In 2015, she attended Easter mass with her family showing a lot of stomach in a revealing white halter-top and a pair of skants. With so many pretty dresses, how are these the ensembles they came up with for church? Then there’s the time Kim Kardashian pushed North in a stroller wearing the most absurdly inappropriate mommy-and-me outfit . Apparently, in Kim’s world it’s totally normal to take the baby out for a walk in a blazer with nothing underneath. She paired the jacket with silver eyeliner, however, it was her retro bouffant that says she’s trying to appear as a stereotypical attentive mom from the 50s. Let’s just hope she was coming out of a weird photo-shoot. Otherwise, someone needs to inform her that average moms wear sweats and no makeup for stroller walks; it’s definitely not a formal affair. And Kim’s lack of fashion boundaries dates back years. In 2011 she decided to ride a camel in Dubai wearing ski-high Christian Louboutins —we’re talking at least 6 inches. Her mom Kris rode closely behind in similarly untimely footwear. Let’s just hope they never used their feet to get the camels going. And that’s just a smattering of occasions these gals have looked sexy in all the wrong places. Let’s keep in touch!
