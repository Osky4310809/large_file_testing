Do not be fooled.\" \nA Catholic group, Hazte Oir, had planned to take it on a nationwide tour of Spanish cities. \nBut Madrid City Council said the vehicle could incite hatred. \nAnother message on the side states: \"If you are born a man, you are a man. If you are a woman, you will continue to be one.\" \nIt is believed to be a response to posters put up in northern Spain by a transgender rights group, which read: \"There are girls with penises and boys with vulvas. It's as simple as that.\" Image copyright Twitter / JCesarPL Image caption The bus was probably a response to posters put up by a transgender rights group \nAn outcry arose in various quarters when the bus was spotted in Madrid on Monday. \nThe Equality spokeswoman for the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, Angeles Alvarez, branded the bus tour \"a hate campaign based on intolerance\", according to Spain's El Pais newspaper. \nA spokeswoman for socialists on Madrid City Council, Purificacion Causapie, called it \"contrary to the dignity and rights of transsexual children\". \nShe urged the mayor's office to ensure Madrid remains \"a city free of discrimination, violence and attacks on minors\". 'The bus of shame' \nThough the outrage centres on its message, the bus has technically been ordered off the roads for breaching municipal rules on outdoor advertising. \nMadrid Mayor Manuela Carmena said the City Council wants the vehicle out of the city \"as soon as possible\". \nThe Councilman for Security, Javier Barbero, said on Tuesday that police had contained \"the bus of shame\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:02:20.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
