By: FE Online | Published: February 24, 2017 2:49 PM This is either a case of failure on the part of the police or it is some foul play between the police and Pulsar Sunil. \nPulsar Sunil, the main accused in the Malayalam actress abduction case, was dramatically taken into custody yesterday afternoon by Kerala police. The main accused had entered the courtroom to surrender but as the magistrate was having lunch, the police forcibly took Pulsar Sunil into custody for questioning. Reacting to the developments, Kummanam Rajasekharan, BJP State President, stated, “The manner in which police took the main accused into custody is disgraceful. It reflects their failure to have apprehended Pulsar Sunil when they had every opportunity to nab them. Why did the police take into custody a person who wanted to surrender in court? This is either a case of failure on the part of the police or it is some foul play between the police and Pulsar Sunil.” \nHe further stated, “Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should clarify what he congratulated the police for. Without help from the top brass of the ruling government, it is not possible for the culprits to move around in the city without being caught. In such a sensitive case where a popular actress has been abducted. Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s statement that this is an isolated case should be withdrawn.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:22:13.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
