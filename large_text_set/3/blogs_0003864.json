Long Story \nSick of keeping up with the Kardashians ? Don't worry, there's a new pack of sisters to gawk at. \nSisters Ellie-Jean Coffey, 22, and 17-year-old Holly-Daze now have over one million followers on Instagram combined and while they have no relation to the actual Kardashians, they acknowledge the comparison. Booty bestie @hollydazecoffeyyy A post shared by Ellie-Jean Coffey (@elliejeancoffey) on Jan 6, 2017 at 8:11pm PST \n“We obviously can see why we're compared because of the whole family unit,\" they said on Australian TV network Sunrise . “But, obviously we're talented — and not fabulously wealthy.” \nYes, talented. And they're not taking about selfies or bikini photos, although they are certainly terrific at those. Talented in that they are competitive surfers with real ambition to make it to the top of the surf world. \nAs a matter of fact, they're actually competing this week as wildcards at the Australian Open of Surfing in Sydney.

Jackson, 21, Ruby-Lee, 16, and Bonnie-Lou, 13 are also accrewing quite the fanbase on Instagram. My sisters are my fav A post shared by Ellie-Jean Coffey (@elliejeancoffey) on Dec 21, 2016 at 3:17am PST \nNowadays, the Coffeys are managed by IMG modeling and sponsored by surfwear company Billabong, but they did come from humble beginnings, unlike the Kardashians who grew up rich and behind the spotlight of the O.J. Simpson case (their pops was O.J.'s lawyer). The first years of their life was spent on the road travelling around their home country in a caravan. \nBeautiful, an interesting back story and pro surfers? Move over Kardashians, these Aussies are coming for your fame.

Drop This Fact \nKim Kardashian has a networth of over $150 million . So yeah, the Coffeys have a long way to go.
