Manchester United endured a frustrating day at Old Trafford as 10-man Bournemouth scraped a draw. \nManchester United, fresh from their EFL Cup triumph, produced one of their most frustrating results of the season as they drew 1-1 with Bournemouth on Saturday. Given the year this has been, is saying something. \nThey drew their 10th Premier League game of the season, the result desperately disappointing against a 10-man Bournemouth team who created only one chance from open play. \nThis result had few redeeming features, particularly since Zlatan Ibrahimovic -- who missed a second half penalty -- may face a ban for an elbow on Tyrone Mings. A missed opportunity to join the top four, to say the least. Manchester United Lineups and Stats \nPositives \nLuke Shaw returned to the starting lineup and looked bright for much of the first half and Marcos Rojo stepped forward with purpose. \nNegatives \nUnited's finishing. They failed to take advantage of Bournemouth's high line in the first half. This was sadly exemplified by Ibrahimovic, who spent much of the game embroiled in a running battle with Bournemouth defenders, and whose touch and vision were poor throughout. \nManager rating out of 10 \n6 -- Jose Mourinho selected a good team, resting Ander Herrera but bringing in Wayne Rooney, and made the best changes he could -- a triple substitution -- when he saw that his team's finishing was getting no better. This, though, was a day when his players let him down. Tactically, they had more than enough to defeat Bournemouth. \nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10 = best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating) \nGK David De Gea, 6 -- Had little to nothing to do other than facing Josh King's penalty, which he made a good attempt to save. Must have been as nonplussed by this result as everyone else. \nDF Antonio Valencia, 7 -- A very strong first half during which he linked up time and again with the forwards and supplied the opener for Rojo. Faded a little in the second half but was far from alone in that. \nDF Phil Jones, 4 -- Had very little to do, which makes it a worry that he did it so poorly. Made a needless foul for Bournemouth's penalty and looked hesitant and unsure in his passing. \nDF Marcos Rojo, 7 -- One of the few to take the game to Bournemouth throughout, scoring the opener and getting forward with ambition and decisiveness. \nDF Luke Shaw, 7 -- Was involved in some hefty challenges, holding his own and getting to the byline on a couple of occasions. Some of his passing was very good and an early through ball to Pogba was sublime. \nMF Michael Carrick, 7 -- His passing through the lines, particularly in the first half, was terrific, opening the visitors up almost at will. Helped maintain a good early tempo. Was substituted when United sought a more direct approach. \nMF Paul Pogba, 5 -- Started the game in rousing mood, but then fell away alarmingly, taking up good positions and having two fine efforts clawed away before losing composure in the final third late on. \nMF Juan Mata, 7 -- Smart, sharp and prompt with his passing from the very beginning, he cut a frustrated figure as those ahead of him lacked the movement to take advantage of his creativity. \nMF Wayne Rooney, 5 -- A good start to the game, his movement unsettling Bournemouth's defence and his unselfishness almost playing in Ibrahimovic, but he dramatically lost his sharpness in the second half. \nMF Anthony Martial, 5 -- An average game in the end, which is startling given how well he began it, beating his man with ease and almost getting United an opener. Looked as if he had run out of ideas by the close of the match, and seemed a little shot-shy. \nFW Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 4 -- A strange performance after his heroics of the previous week. There is a very good argument that he should have been sent off for a vengeful elbow on Mings. What is not in dispute is that his touch, vision and finishing were very poor, and his poor afternoon was rounded off by a penalty saved by Artur Boruc. An afternoon he will wish to forget immediately. \nSubstitutes: \nMF Jesse Lingard, 6 (for Shaw, 70) -- Added energy but could not help to dictate the play and play through the centre of a resolute away team. \nMF Marcus Rashford, 6 (for Rooney, 70) -- Made a couple of promising runs but ultimately little headway against a massed defence. \nMF Marouane Fellaini, 6 (for Carrick, 70) -- Spent much time in the box but was unable to get on the end of several increasingly desperate high balls. \nMusa Okwonga is one of ESPN FC's Manchester United bloggers.
