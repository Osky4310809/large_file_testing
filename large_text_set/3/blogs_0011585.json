If you're more of a goth fairy princess than the colorful, shimmery type, then you're going to be stoked about this new product from Rituel de Fille: an all-black creme highlighter. The brand's Inner Glow Creme Pigment in Eclipse, hitting shelves in April, is available now on presale for $29 . \nEclipse can be worn sheer for a subtle, cool-toned eggplant tint on the cheeks, eyelids, or lips, or applied more thickly for a dark, gothic look. The creme formula can also be layered with other cosmetics to lend an intense moody vibe to lipsticks, blushes, or eye shadows. With no hint of sparkle, this product is almost the opposite of what we've come to expect from a highlighter — and we love it. The all-black starry compact that it's encased in is just an added bonus for any \"all-black everything\" addict's makeup collection. \nScroll on for a sneak peek of the vampire-vibes packaging and color of Eclipse, and then place your preorder on the Rituel de Fille website !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:18:08.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
