Shares One of the gifs comes into play very, very soon here. \nGod bless the PC. Player-created Doom WADs have kept a decades-old series from becoming obsolete, using the openness of the platform to experiment with level design and theme for more than 20 years before finally settling on HDoom’s ultimate conclusion: anime, comedy, and sex. Don’t ask me how I found it ( it was Twitter ), but the first I ever saw of HDoom, which I presume stands for Hentai Doom, was a gif. It features Doomguy grappling to the back of Cyberdemon, somehow managing to achieve penetration despite being a quarter of the size of the monster, who stands immobile and flushed with a sincere sexual passion. It’s one of the greatest moving images I’ve ever seen. The gifs don’t stop there. Doomguy gets a blowjob from a Baron of Hell, goes all the way (every which way) with an imp, and more. for yourself. But the gifs have a purpose. They’re part of a playable Doom WAD where you shoot demons with a love pistol, engage in pillow fight foreplay, and flirt with demons in a hot tub. \nThe super shotgun is around, if demons aren't quite your bag. \nI’ve reached out to the creator, HDoomguy, for more information, but it appears that the flirtation system is meant to be expanded into full on visual novel scenes. A bit more NSFW-sleuthing (at work) led me to this page where you can take a look at art designed for further dialogue and sex scenes. Whether or not they’ll be fully integrated, I’m not sure, but the amount of original art indicates HDoom isn’t meant to be a quick, easy joke. It’s genuine erotica with a comedic edge. Repurposing Doom’s hypermasculine characters and B-movie tropes in an equally exaggerated sexual fantasy is a pretty hilarious contrast—and for the right people, a nice way to get warm. Hell, even if they’re not your thing, the sprites are fantastic and look authentic to Doom’s early ‘90s art style. HDoom isn’t complete, but you can track the progress or play it for yourself by downloading the in-progress package from HDoomguy’s Tumblr page . You’ll also need the latest versions of Zandronum or GZDoom, as well as a copy of Doom or Doom 2 installed. Once you’re good to go, give it a try. After that, I recommend exploring couch co-op. \nI've always wondered, if only you could fuck these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances...
