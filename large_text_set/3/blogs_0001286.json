One player appears to have made quite an impression on the quarterback-hungry San Francisco 49ers – at least in the interview process. \nOn Thursday, 49ers general manger John Lynch raved about former Note Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer, who apparently aced one of the biggest interviews of his life. \n“I’m excited about it,” Lynch told reporters, via USA Today . “I’m sure there will be a lot of different opinions as there always will be. Last night we had an interview with DeShone Kizer. This whole thing is not about an interview, but if we’re grading him on that alone, he blew the doors off of it. He’s an impressive young man. His film is impressive, too.” \nThe 49ers will enter free agency with no quarterbacks on the roster after Colin Kaepernick opted out of the final year of his deal Wednesday. Blaine Gabbert, who started the first five games last season before giving way to Kaepernick, is also a free agent. \nSan Francisco holds the No. 2 pick in April’s draft and could have its choice of the top QB prospects – Deshaun Watson, Mitch Trubisky, Patrick Mahomes and Kizer – if the Browns, who have the top pick, decide to fill another position. \nKizer, a dual threat, was one of the few bright spots last season for the Fighting Irish, throwing for 26 touchdowns and adding eight more on the ground. \nLynch, who was hired by San Francisco in January despite having no previous front office experience, is not being coy about the fact that he’s keeping a close eye on all of the signal-callers at the Combine. \n“I think the same can be said for Deshaun Watson,” Lynch added. “What he has done, putting the team on his shoulders and taking down a great champion – Trubisky, Mahomes, I think it’s a very talented draft class at that position and we’re very excited about those guys. Look, I don’t think you need to be too transparent to know that it’s a position we’re looking at. We don’t have any. That’s a position that’s a big focal point and this week is a big part of that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T04:40:38.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
