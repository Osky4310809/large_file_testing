In Maharashtra,it got pushed to 3rd or 4th place, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. By: FE Online | Pune | Updated: February 23, 2017 8:18 PM Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. (PTI) \nBMC Election Results 2017: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote Facebook blog taking a dig at Congress after the Bharatiya Janata Party’s big win in Maharashtra civic polls. He said that parties which adopt dynastic succession as an alternative to merit-based leadership, suffer from a natural political disadvantage. “In Odisha, Congress got squeezed out of the contest. In Maharashtra,it got pushed to 3rd or 4th place in most cities,” said Jaitley. He invoked PM Narendra Modi ordered note ban and wrote that, “Congress party’s stand on demonetisation of high value currency notes is costing it dearly.” Jaitley congratulated the BJP karyakartas and people of Maharashtra for ensuring an emphatic victory for BJP in the civic polls. \nCongress’ washout from national political scene is a natural outcome of a decade in scandals coupled with its disruptive role in Parliament. \n— Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley) February 23, 2017 \nIn the blog he wrote: “Tax evasion enables a small percentage of the population to unjustly enrich itself at the cost of the exchequer. The poor have overwhelmingly supported demonetization. The Congress Party has lost its traditional constituency of the poor electorate to the BJP. In any case, a Party which has governed India for more than half a century cannot afford to take a stand which supports excessive use of cash and ridicules the new tools of technology which will enable digital transactions to be a substitute for cash. Teh Congress… from a natural party of governance, has moved to the fringe. It’s policies have alienated its constituency of the poor aam aadmi. \n\nHe said that Congress is losing everywhere because of its decade long involvement in scams, “Congress’ washout from national political scene is a natural outcome of a decade in scandals coupled with its disruptive role in Parliament”. \nJaitley also took to Twitter and posted a series of tweets slamming Congress. He said that in the Uttar Pradesh elections, “the downfall of the Congress is so evident that even the SP was wondering if it was worth contesting 103 seats.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:59:01.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
