So, it would be hard to imagine a PGA Tour without some events at Trump-owned courses. \nDoral did lose a World Golf Championship event to Mexico, but according to an annual Sports Illustrated/Golf.com survey of PGA Tour players, 88 percent don’t want events moved away from Trump-owned courses. And some of the players went even further with explanations in the “Loose lips” section. \nFrom the survey: \n“No. They should stick with the best venue, period.”“I think it was appropriate to separate themselves from him during the election, but now that he’s president, they should only move events if he’s impeached or something.”“Absolutely not.”“No. Politics aside, they should secure the best possible venue.” \nThe PGA Tour appears to be pretty united on this issue. \nThumbnail photo via Andrew Weber/USA TODAY Sports Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T07:42:19.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
