But by the end of the first half, when the Falcons had completely flipped momentum, the Dome rocked with chants of “MVP! MVP!” \nThose, of course, were for Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who capped off a brilliant regular season with a terrific performance in the Falcons’ 36-20 win — their first postseason victory in four years and a day — over the Seattle Seahawks to advance to the NFC championship game. \nThe Falcons still could host the game next Sunday if the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys, but if the Cowboys win Atlanta will head to Dallas for the right play in Super Bowl LI in Houston. \nFalcons running backs Tevin Coleman and Devonta Freeman combined for 202 yards from scrimmage, and receiver Julio Jones — tormenting Seahawks corner Richard Sherman early on — caught six passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. Ryan completed 26-of-37 passes, hitting eight different receivers, for 338 yards and three TD passes. The Falcons rolled up 422 yards of offense — the most the Seahawks have allowed in a postseason game in nearly six years. \nYou can joke that Future jinxed the Seahawks , or that they might have had a better chance if Earl Thomas was on the field. But Ryan and the run game delivered, and the Falcons turned in a physical and furious performance and earned the win. View photo .

But the Falcons flipped the game completely before halftime with a dizzying series of events : a devastating penalty, a safety and a Falcons field goal and touchdown. \nDevin Hester’s 80-yard kickoff return was called back, pinning the Seahawks on their own goal line. Then replacement rookie right guard Rees Odhiambo stepped on the foot of Russell Wilson, who fell into his own end zone for a safety and a 10-9 Falcons lead. The Falcons then got the ball back on the free kick and tacked on three more points with a Matt Bryant 35-yard field goal. \nThe Seahawks went three-and-out, opting not to go for it on 4th-and-1 from their own 39-yard line. The punt rolled to the Atlanta 1-yard line, and Ryan and Co. went to work on what would be their seventh TD drive of at least 92 yards this season. That’s when the “MVP” chants first started raining down from the crowd, and he had earned them. \nFalcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, who to this point hasn’t landed a head-coaching job, called a brilliant series as they cruised 99 yards on nine plays. Ryan hit on 7-of-9 passes, accounting for all of the yards on the drive, and hit a wide-open Coleman on a back-breaking touchdown pass to head into the half with a 19-10 lead. \nThe Falcons tacked on another touchdown on the opening drive of the second half, and it too was a gem — 13 plays, 75 yards in just under six minutes. They brilliantly mixed the run and pass as Coleman and Devonta Freeman combined for 44 yards on the drive. Freeman capped it off on a 1-yard score to push the Seahawks’ beleaguered defense into a deeper hole. \nThe Falcons’ improved defense was gutted on the opening drive of the game but stepped up with enough big plays — a huge red-zone sack by Brooks Reed in the second quarter seemed to spur the unit — in a game, hard-hitting performance. Holding to the Seahawks to a field goal midway through the third quarter was a win, all things considered, following a tough penalty against the Falcons as the Seahawks attempted to punt on 4th-and-2 from their own 32-yard line. The Falcons matched with a field goal of their own to start the fourth quarter pretty much put the game away for good, even with Wilson finding Doug Baldwin for a 31-yard TD pass to make it a two-score game with 3:29 left. \nWilson got off to a red-hot start and his scrambling gave the Falcons fits at times, but he was held in check for the most part, finishing 17-of-30 passing for 225 yards with a touchdown and two fourth-quarter interceptions, one by rookie Deion Jones on a wild deflected pass that looked like a catch. Seattle’s awful offensive line play became too hard to overcome, as Wilson was running for his life most of the game, and the run game didn’t produce enough to help out. \nThis was only the Falcons’ fourth postseason win since the lone Super Bowl appearance in franchise history almost 20 years ago. The Falcons have an offensive juggernaut that just rolled through a battle-tested Seahawks defense, and Ryan backed up his MVP-caliber regular season with his biggest postseason performance. \nIf this is it for the Georgia Dome, it was a hell of a way to tear the building down — with a scorching offense that few remaining teams appear equipped to stop. And Ryan was the engineer, helping end the narrative that he can’t deliver a huge performance in a playoff game. – – – – – – – \nEric Edholm is a writer for Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.
