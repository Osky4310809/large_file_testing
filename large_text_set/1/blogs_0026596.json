So I was intrigued immediately,” Colby told TheWrap from the home of a “very famous” publicist where she was set to speak with Hollywood icon Tippi Hedren for an upcoming episode. \n“There has definitely been a celebrity element and, as an entertainment attorney prior to this new career in news, I have particular interest in coming back to the old neighborhood,” Colby said.

Despite’s Bourdain sweet gig, Colby prefers her own job. \n“You know what, if I was Anthony Bourdain I’d be 800 pounds,” Colby said. “I have a lot of really great experiences and I know that viewers appreciate the travel and the hard work. They realize you can’t do this much without making a sacrifice. I do feel blessed and I’m extremely grateful.” \nThe inherited items that have caught Colby’s attention this year include the oldest pair of Levi jeans in the world, Abraham Lincoln’s childhood mallet and the Magna Carta of basketball.

Season 3 of “Strange Inheritance” features 28 new episodes that kept Colby on the road for 300 days last year to film, and she already has a committed from Fox to proceed with the show’s fourth season. \n“We’ve discovered that this is a binge-watched show. Many people watch an episode or two live and then they may just let a bunch record,” Colby said. “It was deserving of as large an order. I remember when I used to package deals in Hollywood, if we got six, eight or 13 episodes of a run of something, it was a big deal. Fox has made a very generous commitment.” \nDespite the huge episode order, Colby doesn’t expect to run out of ideas anytime soon.

She’s set for a similar schedule in 2017 \n“We really take the time to do it right,” she said. \nBack-to-back new episodes of “Strange Inheritance with Jamie Colby” air tonight at 9 p.m. ET. 23 Most-Watched Cable News Hosts Of 2016, From Don Lemon to Megyn Kelly (Photos) \n2016 was a wild year for cable news networks, so where did viewers go when they wanted coverage of everything from celebrity deaths to the presidential election? Find out here with the Top 23 shows ranked by rating. TheWrap \n23. “CNN Tonight with Don Lemon” \nLemon’s primetime show averaged 924,000 viewers and is a unique combination of straight newscast and opinion programming. CNN essentially allows Lemon to do what he thinks will benefit viewers on a nightly basis, which was evident when he recently choked up remembering news legend Gwen Ifill. CNN \n22. “Erin Burnett Outfront” \nBurnett continues to be one of the most-watched programs on CNN, averaging 948,000 viewers on a nightly basis. CNN \n21. “The Kelly File” – repeat \nIt’s been quite a year for Megyn Kelly and the late-night repeat of “The Kelly File” averages one million viewers per night, topping the live edition of most cable news competitors. NBC \n20. “Hardball with Chris Matthews” \nMatthews averaged 1.05 million viewers to help MSNBC defeat CNN in the 7 p.m. hour during the wild political year of 2016. MSNBC \n19. “All In With Chris Hayes” \nHayes averaged 1.07 million viewers with his unique take on political issues while managing to squeeze in time to grab a drink with TheWrap . TheWrap \n18. “11th Hour with Brian Williams” \nBrian Williams returned to primetime after a stint as an afternoon breaking news anchor to average 1.14 million viewers, giving MSNBC a hit show while resurrecting Williams’ career at the same time. NBC \n17. “Anderson Cooper 360” \nCooper had CNN’s most-watched program of 2016, with 1.14 million viewers. While Cooper is a household name and widely recognized, many will find it odd that he finished behind so many cable news competitors. CNN \n16. “Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell” \nO’Donnell, who was a writer on “The West Wing” before landing his MSNBC gig, averaged 1.24 million viewers in 2016. MSNBC \n15. “Fox & Friends” \nThe Fox News morning show hosted Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade and Ainsley Earhardt averaged 1.27 million viewers. By comparison, cable news rivals “New Day” averaged 508,000 and MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” averaged 677,000. Fox \n14. Fox News’ 2 p.m. ET Hour \nThis one is complicated, as “Real Story with Gretchen Carlson” occupied this spot until she filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, who eventually stepped down in disgrace. Carlson’s old show combined with a variety of replacements averaged 1.35 million viewers. TheWrap \n13. “The O’Reilly Factor” – repeat \nBill O’Reilly is so popular that the late-night repeat of his primetime show averaged more viewers than most competitors pick up on a good night, with 1.39 million viewers tuning into the second run of “Factor.” Fox \n12. “The Rachel Maddow Show” \nMaddow is the most-watched show that isn’t on Fox News Channel, averaging 1.43 million viewers. 2016 was Maddow’s most-watched year in the show’s history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:22:23.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
