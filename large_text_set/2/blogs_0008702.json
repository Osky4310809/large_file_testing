But that's exactly what happened to countless Torontonians (read: a bunch of people on Twitter) Thursday night, who were told they would be delivered free Delissio pizza via UberEats in honour of National Pizza Day. \nI will preface this by saying I have no idea what National Pizza Day actually is, but I was hungover today and wanted pizza nonetheless. Lo and behold, like a literal walk-on-water miracle, when I logged onto UberEats, there was a deal for #PizzaNight by Delissio. It sounded too good to be true: one margherita pizza, a tub of Haagen Dazs salted caramel gelato, and two cans of perrier for free. There was even a promo code to remove the delivery free. TBH just writing these words is making my mouth salivate and my heart ache. \nI tried ordering the meal twice, along with a couple of my friends. We waited for a while, but the order wouldn't confirm. I cancelled and tried again twice. The third time I tried ordering, I got a message that said, the deal was \"temporarily unavailable,\" which has since graduated to \"sold out.\" \nNaturally, I went on Twitter to see what others were saying. Was there hope that I would have free pizza in my tummy tonight? As is often the case, I saw more bad than good. \n\"What gives @UberEATS .. is this a pizza lottery?? Currently sitting at 0/7 for order attempts\", tweeted Corey Brendan, who later complained that in addition to being bailed on, he was charged $1 for cancellation. \nA man named Marc Cormier has been steadily tweeting shade at Uber for over an hour, exhibiting the kind of bitterness normally reserved for divorce proceedings. \nMarc, it seems, had his order cancelled on him six times, despite placing the order the minute the promotion started at 6 PM. \n\"And it's time to #delete @UberEATS ,\" he wrote, screenshotting himself doing just that and noting that someone on Uber's marketing team \"better polish his resume.\" Echoing his sentiments, a dude called David told Uber: \"you can't be trusted.\" \nHeartbreakingly, one woman said her order was cancelled a minute before it was set to arrive. \nSome people, like Eric Bye , threatened to turn to Foodora for future take-out. \n\" @UberEATS just bombing while the city starves,\" he said. \nPersonally, my feelings aligned the most with someone called Ev who described this screwup as the #Trumpofpizza. \nWho knows if we'll ever know what really happened on #PizzaNight. But one thing is clear, instead of the delicious combination of cherry tomatoes and cheese, I am sitting here with nothing but a sour taste in my mouth. \nFollow Manisha Krishnan on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:15:51.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
