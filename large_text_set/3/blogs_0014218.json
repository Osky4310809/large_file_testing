The data will come from a number of scientific organisations including the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.\nBefore he was elected to parliament, Roberts was the head of the Galileo Movement, an organisation dedicated to proving that humans are not responsible for climate change.\nHe believes climate denial conspiracy theories including that the United Nations is trying to impose global government through climate change policy .\nIn November One Nation released a 42-page document claiming the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology corrupted climate data and that global warming is an international scam.\nIn his invitation, Roberts claimed the chief scientist, the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology had also been invited to the climate denial event… but the CSIRO and BOM told BuzzFeed News they hadn’t received an invitation.
