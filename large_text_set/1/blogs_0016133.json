Once SpaceX — or a rising competitor like Blue Origin — proves it can reuse these orbital rocket boosters, the cost of access to space could begin a dramatic downward slope . \nBut the photo also represents a big sigh of relief for SpaceX, which had a rough year in 2016. \nEverything started off well enough: The company successfully launched Falcon 9 rockets and landed five of their boosters. But on September 1, a Falcon 9 rocket exploded into a fireball during a routine launchpad test, destroying a satellite that Facebook had intended to lease. SpaceX founder and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk later called the accident \" the most difficult and complex failure \" in his company's history. \nBy the time an investigation nailed down the cause and a fix, SpaceX had lost a customer, 4 months' worth of launch window, and a quarter of a billion dollars . \nSo with the company's flawless Jan. 14 launch, SpaceX has a lot to celebrate, and the photo is a fitting trophy. \nHowever, Musk and his company are not out of the spaceflight woods yet. This is only the first of 70 launches, worth an estimated $10 billion, that SpaceX has booked in the coming years. The company is also due to debut its more powerful three-rocket Falcon Heavy launch system later this year, launch its first human passengers into space in 2018 aboard the Dragon capsule, and begin blanketing the entire planet in high-speed internet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:06:15.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
