This short article will help answer that concern. Practice Every Day \nIce skating is a skill that involves much practice. Figure skaters really do need to practice every day. Also, one on-ice practice session is not enough; serious skaters need to be on the ice for at least two or three practice sessions per day. \nSome serious skaters skate six days a week, but many ice skaters practice four or five days a week. Off-Ice Training \nIt is best to supplement on-ice sessions with off-ice training in ballet , dance, and conditioning. Also, every figure skater should spend some time practicing figure skating jumps off the ice. Private Lessons \nAt least one to two private lessons a week is necessary. One private lesson per day is really the ideal option; however, private ice skating instruction is quite expensive, so that ideal may not be possible for many skaters. Don't Skip Practice Sessions or Lessons \nVery little progress will occur if a skater skips practices and lessons. Commit to a skating schedule and stick to it. Sample Figure Skating Training Schedule \nA sample Monday through Friday schedule for a young skater could be as follows: One forty-five minute freestyle practice session before school One forty-five minute freestyle practice session after schoolor Two freestyle practice sessions after school or one two-hour public session after school Off-ice ballet class on Saturday Two to three twenty minute private ice skating lessons per week", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:29:53.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
