His next court date will be on March 27th,” he said. “That’s the court date we came with from two days ago. Right now, we’re still working it out and I’m fighting for his civil rights and being his voice. The courts took his voice and he can’t choose his own lawyer. He’s being mistreated in jail, neglected. They’re taking away his civil rights. I’m his son and just trying to speak for my father. I also started my new legacy through a label as well.” \nDuring the short interview on the red carpet, he gave insight into the last conversation between him and his father. \n“I only said a few words because I only see him in court,” said Knight Jr. “It’s been two years since I’ve seen him in the court. Those few words were, ‘I love you, Dad’ and ‘Don’t worry.’ That’s it. He looked at me and wrote a note to his lawyer Thaddeus [Culpepper] and I got it the next day and it said, ‘Son, I thank you for coming to see me. I appreciate it. I love you and I know you can do it.'” \nKnight Jr. also shares his thoughts on what he wants for his father’s portrayal in the upcoming Tupac biopic, All Eyez on Me and sheds light on a Death Row biopic that’s in the works. \n“ All I can hope is that they present him in the right and correct way,” he explained. “Pretty soon you can look forward to the Death Row biopic as well. We’re working on that one as well. … I don’t want to say right now [who we are working with] and it’s under construction. We’re working on it. Look out for it coming next year or Summer coming up.” \nWatch the full interview with Suge Knight Jr. above.
