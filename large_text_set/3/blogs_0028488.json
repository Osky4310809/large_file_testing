I saved it on the first two but then couldn’t save it on the third and then there’s no real way of slowing down...\" he said. \n“My front wheel was heading down and the back wheel was going up and overtook me, pushing me forward and then I got my face ploughed into the gravel. I was out cold for a few minutes... \nStransky also thanked fans and organisers for their support. \n“Everyone has been hugely supportive, the medical support I had was incredible... so to everyone, a huge thank you.” \nStransky, who was partnered by former Sharks centre Jeremy Thomson in the Grand Masters category, was rushed to a nearby hospital. \nStransky expressed his sadness that he couldn’t assist his team-mate further in the event. \n“I saw him, he had a little tear in his eye. It’s been a long journey for us, we’ve trained hard, so I feel like I’ve let him down a bit... but we’ll be back stronger and we’ll ride again for sure!” Stransky concluded. \n<br _moz_dirty=\"\" />", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T08:24:37.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
