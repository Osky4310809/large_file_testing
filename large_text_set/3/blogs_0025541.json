Jan was not wearing her helmet and suffered multiple skull fractures. We have details on the accident at this link and a blog post from JR at this link . Our condolences go out to Ross and his family as he announced tonight that a priest delivered Last Rites to Jan at the Oklahoma University Medical Center. Ross wrote: A Priest gave my wife Jan her last rites tonight. My little Angel is gone. ???? \nTravis Akers, joem49er, Michael Kroeger, Dominic Budassi, SonOfSarcastic, Peter Brust and @KOllomani contributed to this article.
