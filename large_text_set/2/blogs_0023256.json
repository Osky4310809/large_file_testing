Fordham Road at 4:05 a.m. on Dec. 17. \nA video of the crash shows a white minivan slam into Japa as she stood on a double-yellow line waiting to cross, sending her rolling down the snowy road about 40 feet. \nThe driver, identified as Mene Mpeke, who could not be reached by the Daily News, then gets out of the van for a minute before getting back behind the wheel and driving away. The police report on the crash inaccurately states that Japa spoke with police and that the driver didn’t leave the scene, the notice of claim charges. \nPregnant teen plans to sue NYC after cops zapped her with Taser \nJapa says she was walking with her sister and boyfriend when she was struck. At least three other people also saw the crash, according to the notice of claim. Yet no witnesses are noted in the report. \n“You look at the accident report and it’s like (the driver) never left,” Japa’s attorney Eric Sanders said. “They covered up a serious accident.” Tishira Japa sustained serious injuries after being struck by a minivan in the Bronx in December. She says police covered up the crash and didn’t investigate it as a hit-and-run. \nAn NYPD spokesman said the driver left the scene because he feared for his safety. That is not noted in the accident report. \nInvestigators failed to follow proper protocol for such a serious crash, Sanders said. \nDeaf woman gets $100G after NYPD wouldn’t provide interpreter \nJapa suffered seven fractures in her pelvis that could affect her for the rest of her life, papers charge. \nJapa has been contacted by NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau detectives, Sanders said. The notice of claim alleges the driver of the car “may be related to an NYPD police officer.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:21:00.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
