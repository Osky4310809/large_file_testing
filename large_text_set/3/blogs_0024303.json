Mattress maker Casper just launched a good, old-fashioned hotline to help. You might as well try it because A: it’s free, B: it beats tossing and turning, and C: it’s funny.\nIn one of the most memorable pitches in years, Casper offers callers several recorded options. Press one for ocean sounds or two for wind chimes. Another lets you listen to a conference call planning Casper’s campaign.\nMy favorite option is No. 3, which lets you “travel back in time to the 1990s.” No spoilers here, but suffice it to say, the chosen audio nails it. You can also enjoy 1990s Family Matters star Jaleel White (that’s Steve Urkel to you) singing a lullaby. \nCall 888-890-2040 to listen for yourself.

Aside from the usual podcast and TV ads, it’s also sponsored a traveling “napmobile.” And it promoted a dog bed with a three-course steak dinner for 15 canine \"influencers.\" \nWatch Casper woos canine influencers : \nI’m not sure how many mattresses all this will sell, but it is a good way to build good will.
