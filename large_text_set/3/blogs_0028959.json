They allege she called black men “women beaters” and said blacks wanted to physically harm whites.   \nThe suit claims Slater said black employees mispronounced words, such as “mother,” “father,” and “ask,” and told Brown to say them aloud at a meeting. Slater is also accused of asking Wright if all three of her children were “fathered by the same man.” \nBoth The Wrap and Variety in their reports of Slater’s dismissal noted that she was also accused of calling black women “sista.” She also allegedly raised her hands in a “Hands up, don’t shoot” gesture when she was wished a goodnight by two black employees. \n“We are confident that the good men and women of the Bronx will hold Fox accountable for what we believe to be its abhorrent racist conduct, reminiscent of the Jim Crow era,” lawyers Douglas H. Wigdor and Jeanne Christensen of the Wigdor law firm said in a statement. \nBrown and Wright are suing Slater, Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, claiming that Slater’s superiors did little to address her behavior, creating a hostile work environment that resulted in “severe and pervasive discrimination and harassment.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:07:29.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
