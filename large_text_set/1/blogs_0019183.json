Singapore’s current toll charges (left), VEP fees (right) \nLiow also welcomed Singapore’s decision to lift its RRC once Malaysia implements the RC at its other entry points bordering Thailand, and stressed that the move was not meant to discriminate Singaporeans. \nIlango also justified the need for the RC, as Malaysia did not respond to Singapore’s implementation of the VEP policy in 1973. “It makes sense for Malaysia to charge foreign-registered vehicles the RC, especially for the maintenance, and wear and tear of our roads,” Ilango said. \nWhen asked about the impact of the RC on Malaysians, Ilango stated only those driving Malaysian-registered cars would be affected, as there were also many Malaysians who were driving Singapore-registered cars to avoid paying VEP fees. \nOn Monday, Singapore announced that it would increase its RRC to SGD6.40 (RM20) beginning February 15 in response to Malaysia’s RM20 RC that was implemented November 1 last year. Foreign-registered vehicles entering the republic would be required to pay the RRC on top of the daily Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fees, toll charges and fixed Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) fees upon departure at the Tuas or Woodlands Checkpoints.
