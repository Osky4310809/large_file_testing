The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) held a voting contest to name their new research boat. The NERC decided to go with David Attenborough , named after the Planet Earth narrator. \nOn March 24, the Isle of Wight Council started a contest to rename their new state of the art, modern floating bridge. The currently registered name is, ‘Floating Bridge number 6.’ 2 Facebook \nThe Facebook posts reads: “We’ll admit, ‘Floating Bridge number 6’ isn’t the most exciting of names for our new state of the art, modern floating bridge; but it is its registered name. Think you can do a better job of naming her? Now is your chance to get involved and think of something more exciting. \nPlease comment on this ‘pinned post’ with your suggestions before 12 noon on 7 April 2017. \nOnce collated, the best six suggestions will be put to the public vote via Facebook.” \nThere’s currently more than 2,000 comments and most of them read, ‘Floaty McFloatface.’ Imagine that. The Isle of Wight Council will take suggestions until April 7. Do your best internet! 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:36:27.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
