Sort of.\nFor all the ways that Minecraft has been twisted and transformed over the years, Pokémon: Cobalt and Amethyst is something new. It's a full-blown game built inside of Minecraft , with what developer Phoenix Projects says is \"60 to 80 hours\" of gameplay.\nSEE ALSO: 7 things 'Pokémon Go' badly needs in 2017\nAt its heart, Cobalt and Amethyst is meant to recreate the original Pokémon RPG in a new format. According to the official description , it includes \"battling, capturing, and training Pokémon, fighting trainers, and challenging Gym Leaders and, ultimately, the Pokémon League.\"\nThe game is the product of an almost three-year development process. Getting it set up and running smoothly is a little tricky — since this is Minecraft and not an actual Pokémon game — but the video above provides step-by-step instructions.\nWe haven't tested the game ourselves yet, so it's hard to say how it runs or plays. But on the face of things, this is an impressive twisting of the Minecraft foundation into something completely different.\nIf you're interested in the technical side of things, Phoenix chronicled Cobalt and Amethyst 's development in a 139-episode YouTube playlist.\nYou can download the game for free right here and check out more stuff on Phoenix Projects' website . You might want to act quickly, however; Nintendo is diligent about protecting its intellectual property and has a history of shutting down Pokémon fan projects.\nBONUS: Make a super realistic 3D version of yourself in your own home", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/8KR99V1P.m3u8", "http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/maps/2791466-pokemon-cobalt-amethyst-pokemon-in-vanilla", "http://phoenixsc.me/pokemon-cobalt-and-amethyst-official-walkthrough/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/8KR99V1P.jpg", "http://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/lib/aab-be381ac80ab7cb74cefd12800e062dbd.js", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLmYjNW5fJqQzsX_SHbAFhbn8wvgJrzngL", "https://www.mediafire.com/?1v92o9ro82ydd0u", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLa7YZeyOKk?enablejsapi=1&"], "published": "2017-02-06T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:13:09.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
