A teaser image was posted on the company’s official Facebook page recently, allowing with the all-important date – March 7, 2017. \nNot a lot to be taken away from the image, as it shows merely a small area of the SUV’s front face. Volvo’s signature “Thor’s hammer” daytime running lights are clearly seen here, along with a grille design that appears to be more contemporary take on the current XC60’s grille. \nSaid grille features the Volvo Iron Mark emblem, which should accommodate plenty of sensors linked to the car’s safety and driver assist systems. Even through our best efforts of brightening the image, there’s not a lot more to be seen here (unless you enjoy garage doors). \nAside from the launch date and image, Volvo is keeping mum on the details of its new model, which we suspect is likely the XC60. Previous spyshots of XC60 prototypes do appear to feature some of the cues seen here. \nMeanwhile, comparing spyshots of the XC40 to this image is a little harder, as the ones supplied to us don’t really provide a good look at some of the exterior details. Both cars are highly-anticipated models and Volvo should create quite a stir in Geneva, regardless of which SUV takes to the stage.
