Bad quarterback. Good luck EJ. I wish things had gone differently.

What’s that? Bill Belichick’s on line 1? dohczeppelin says: Mar 16, 2017 7:20 PM \nI kept pulling for him to turn it around but after watching him fail spectacularly in week 17 of this past season, completely missing a touchdown pass to Charles Clay that anyone reading this comment could have made because the Jets Defense blew their assignments and let the tight end jog towards the end zone uncovered, I knew it was officially over. \nHe is a competent back up though and an all around stand up guy that will never embarrass his team or fans with low class off the field nonsense though. Mar 16, 2017 7:33 PM \nHe’ll never see the field.. McLovin gone? ak185 says: Mar 16, 2017 7:34 PM \nNot a franchise QB perhaps, but still salvageable. Buffalo didn’t have a great coaching staff when he was picked (I wouldn’t say that they do now, either) and he definitely could have used better development than he got there. He does a good deep ball, but he takes too long to read coverages and stares down his receiver too often. Good backup, perhaps with the right coaching, he can make a low end starter for someone. Probably not Oakland of course, considering who they’ve already got there. \nI do kind of wonder why the Raiders went after him, though. Seems they could have spent the money elsewhere, considering that they have Connor Cook? Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
