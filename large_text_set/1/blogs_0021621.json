For the most part, things are going OK, though he’s not happy about how how much the job is cutting into his TV time. Also, he would like to take a vacation soon.\nThe New York Times got a behind-the-scenes peek at Mr. Trump’s daily life in the White House and it’s about as fascinatingly boring as you might imagine.\nRelated: Donald Trump just issued a press release boasting about how great he is; internet begs to differ \nHere are a few facts we learned about Donald’s day-to-day routine:\nHe wakes up every morning before 6 a.m. and watches TV for several hours. First, he watches it upstairs in the residence, which he describes as “very elegant,” then he goes downstairs to the dining room in the West Wing and continues watching it there there while he reads the paper. His morning TV-watching continues for approximately three hours, until 9 a.m. when his daily briefings start, which the Times says is a challenge because it “significantly curtails his television time.” In the evenings, he retreats back upstairs to the residence where he continues watching more television late into the night while munching on Lay’s potato chips and tweeting from an unsecured Android phone. He sleeps in the White House master bedroom, which he praises for its “pure elegance and room size,” as well as its history. “There’s something very special when you know that Abraham Lincoln slept there,” he says.

He is impressed by the scale of the White House, which is the only property he has ever slept in that is more famous than his own. He and his staffers are so in awe of the Oval Office that sometimes they just stare at it. “I’ve had people come in; they walk in here and they just want to stare for a long period of time,” he says. He claims the White House phones are “the most beautiful phones I’ve ever used in my life.” They are also “the world’s most secure,” so he doesn’t have to worry about anyone listening in on his calls, which apparently he finds very reassuring. He doesn’t mind spending all day and night inside the building because, as the Times puts it, “Mr. Trump can go for days without breathing in fresh outside air.” As for his family, Donald says Melania and Barron are back in New York recouping from last weekend’s exhausting inaugural festivities. They’ll return to Washington, D.C. for the weekend. The family is already planning a vacation. They’re eyeing a getaway to Mar-a-Lago the first weekend in February, just two weeks after Donald started his new job.\nRemember when he said Hillary Clinton didn’t have the “stamina” to be President?\nRelated: Trapped in a glided cage: Does Melania Trump deserve our sympathy? \n’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:16:20.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
