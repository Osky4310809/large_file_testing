It helps, if she was ugly, I wouldn't really enjoy my time here,” he told MTV News . \n\"And she's good at kissing… I've said too much!\" Bear planted a kiss on Charlotte in the teaser clip (Photo: MTV) The show challenges people to let their loved ones design a tattoo (Photo: MTV) They've kept coy on dating rumours (Photo: MTV) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Bear Snapchats video of him pinching Charlotte Crosby's bum Share this video Watch Next \nCelebrity Big Brother winner Bear and former Geordie Shore star Charlotte co-host the new programme, which sees people getting tattooed by friends and family without knowing what the inking will look like. \n\"There was lots of crazy moments in the show. One of the craziest things would probably be me physically attacking Bear after seeing what he did to us,” Charlotte told MTV. \nShe declined to reveal just what Bear did, though, meaning we’ll have to tune in when the show kicks off on Monday, April 3 at 10pm to find out. They filmed the MTV show last year His and Hers jumpers suggested at romance (Photo: Instagram) \nThe pair are currently on holiday together abroad; they jetted off together despite rumours circulating that Charlotte had ditched Bear because of his antics on E4’s Celebs Go Dating. \nBear is signed up for the second series of the show, which sees celebrities trying to find love with regular members of the public. \nHe hinted to Heat magazine earlier this month his role on Celebs Go Dating was a barrier to a relationship with Charlotte happening. \n“She’s funny, she’s witty, she’s clever, she’s independent - she’s got all the right attributes. It’s just the wrong time, because I’m filming the show,” he said.
