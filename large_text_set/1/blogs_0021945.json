Tulsi Gabbard says she met with Syrian President Bashar Assad during a recent trip to the war-torn country.\nAppearing on CNN, the Hawaii Democrat says there is no possibility for a viable peace agreement in Syria unless Assad is part of the conversation.\nGabbard says, “Whatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria.”\nGabbard, a major in the Army National Guard, met last November with Donald Trump shortly after the presidential election. She backed Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent.\nShe says she took the meeting with Trump over concern that a wing of the Republican Party known as the neocons will grow in influence once Trump’s in office. She feared that could push the U.S. more deeply into Syria.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:20:17.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
