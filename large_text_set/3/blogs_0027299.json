But an appeals court later ordered a retrial. In 2014, the court dismissed the charges of killing protesters, citing the prosecution for technical flaws, and the ruling earlier this month further absolved him of any accountability and paved the way for his release.\nMubarak, who became president in 1981 after the assassination of President Anwar Sadat, was initially held in Tora prison before being transferred to the hospital due to his deteriorating medical condition.\nOn Friday, Deeb said that the former leader’s “health is good,” and that he would continue to receive medical treatment at his home. He added that were no other legal cases pending against Mubarak and that “his legal situation is fine.”\n“There is nothing wrong,” said Deeb.\nMubarak, he added, has no plans to hold a news conference or participate in any media appearances. Nor does he have any firm ideas yet on how he plans to spend his time in the weeks and months ahead,\n“He has no plans for the near future,” said Deeb. “He is just staying at home and resting.”\nRead more:\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostworld/", "https://twitter.com/@raghavanWaPo"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:18:29.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
