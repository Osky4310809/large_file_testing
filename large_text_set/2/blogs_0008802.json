They broke up in 2009 after almost five years together. They were engaged again, however, by early 2010 and they quietly tied the knot in Hawaii on June 24, 2010. \nSon Noah was born in September 2012, so no one can claim these two rushed into that part (Green was already dad to son Kassius with ex Vanessa Marcil ). \n\"We've had obstacles, and we've overcome them,\" Fox told Cosmopolitan in 2012. \"I truly feel like he's my soul mate. I don't want to sound corny or cliché, but I do believe we are destined to live this part of our lives together.\" \nShe and Green welcomed son Bodhi in February 2014. Months later Fox told Men's Health about marriage, \"You will go through phases where you're just not getting along. You're not communicating well. That's going to happen, and it's going to feel impossible to you sometimes. It might not even make sense to you sometimes. Arguments are normal. You have to be patient and sit through that and remember that this is a part of human communication and interaction. You're going to have these conflicts with anyone. It's not necessarily just that person.\" Photos \nMegan Fox and Brian Austin Green's Quotes on Parenthood \nThey vacationed in Hawaii, their favorite getaway spot, in January 2015, but by June they had separated and, a couple of days after the news broke, Fox filed for divorce . \nThe longtime couple didn't stick to that plan, however, and instead took the opportunity to recapture the romance, work on their issues and, ultimately, reconcile. Regardless of what order they did all that in, Fox turned up pregnant in April 2016 and they welcomed son Journey River —a heavily symbolic little boy's name if there ever was one—in August. \nGreen and Fox have tested the strength of their bond multiple times over the years, at different ages and stages, and they seem to keep discovering that there's no one they'd rather work on a relationship with than each other. Instagram \nIs any famous family more ridiculously adorable than Nick and Vanessa Lachey 's? \nWell, it wasn't obvious from the start that things would turn out so happily ever after for the parents of three, including son Phoenix , who was just born in December. \nVanessa starred in Nick's \"What's Left of Me\" video, his musical summation of the aftermath of his divorce from Jessica Simpson , and they started dating in 2006. They broke up, however, in June 2009, possibly after Nick did something dumb, but the split didn't take. \n\"We're trying to figure things out,\" Nick told Us Weekly that September. \"I don't pretend to know what the future holds, but everything's good. Vanessa's a good girl, and I care about her a lot.\" \nIn October, he said on Good Day Philadelphia , \"I was single for a minute there, and then we've kind of patched things up.\" \"Kind of\" eventually turned into definitively and they got engaged a year later, marrying on July 15, 2011, on Sir Richard Branson 's private Necker Island. REX/Shutterstock \nConsidering how devoted Adam Levine is to Behati Prinsloo —and now to their little girl, Dusty Rose —it's easy to forget that the Maroon 5 frontman didn't have it all figured out when he first met her. \nHe dated model Anne Vyalitsyna for about two years and, not long after they broke up in 2012, he met Prinsloo (a pal of Anne V's) and they started dating, making it red carpet official that October. \nLevine must have gotten all freaked out about his feelings or whatever, though, because they broke up the following spring and he was spotted out and about with Nina Agdal . But by June 2013, he and Prinsloo had reunited and were engaged by July. \n\"You know, I still don't think you have to get married, unless you meet someone that makes you want to marry them. And then you marry them and it's wonderful,\" Levine said on The Tonight Show in October 2013. They tied the knot in July 2014, defiantly celebrate their one-year anniversary in the face of split rumors (\"That's so mean. We're so happy, why would you do that?\" Levine wondered aloud on Late Night With Seth Meyers in 2015) and welcomed their daughter in September. Photos \nHotter After Breakup: Celeb Breakovers! Rob Kim/Getty Images \nPink and Carey Hart know the drill when it comes to split rumors—though usually they've been triggered by the rambunctious, proudly unorthodox couple themselves. \nThe singer met the motocross rider in 2001 at the X Games when she was, like, 22, and after dating off and on, she proposed to him in 2005, writing \"Will you marry me? I'm serious!\" on a pit board during a race. \nThey got married in Costa Rica in January 2006, but separated in 2008. However, Hart than appeared in Pink's \"So What\" video (you know, \"my ex'll start a fight\" and whatnot), so their status got a little confusing. \n\"This break up is not about cheating, anger, or fighting...\" Pink wrote on her website. \"He is a good man, so please support him as well. One never knows the future, but mine and Carey's just might involve beach babies and sunshine one day.\" \nSure enough, they went on to never actually divorce, and in November 2010 Pink announced on Ellen that she was pregnant; daughter Willow was born in June 2011. Read \nPippa Middleton and James Matthews Are Engaged: 9 Famous Couples Who Broke Up and Got Back Together \nPink later told Redbook about how she and Carey reconciled before Willow was born, revealing, \"Eleven months after we broke up, he asked me to fly to Las Vegas to perform on New Year's Eve at his club. I wanted to see him. And I looked hot. There's something about breaking up with someone—you just look hotter than you ever did before. \n\"I will never look as good as I did those six months after we broke up. Never! Anyway, after sound check I told him that he needed to come to my room. I had made him a photo album of all the cards he had ever given me, of all the photos of our entire relationship. \n\"I spent months on this album. On the last page, I pasted a photo of me from a really bad movie I made years ago with my neck slit and blood everywhere. Next to it I wrote, 'This is me without you.' On the next page, there was a picture of a baby. And I wrote: 'The rest is unwritten.' The divorce papers that we never signed were behind that page. I was like, 'The rest is up to you.' And I did all of this in his favorite bra and panties.\" \nAnd despite her joke to Ellen DeGeneres last May that she and Carey were due for their third breakup in 10 years (they apparently had two before Willow arrived), they opted for expanding their family with son Jameson Moon instead. \nWe're starting to suspect these kindred spirits belong together. Instagram \nAnd how about these two?! Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth 's engagement seemed headed for the dustbin full of young-Hollywood romances that never stood a chance after they broke up in 2013 , right after Miley burst out of her shell with a vengeance at the VMAs. \nThey had dated, already off and on, for four years, spending the last year engaged. \nBut distance—geographical and emotional—really did make the heart grow fonder. After both took some time to sow their wild oats, Miley's oats seemingly proving just a tad wilder than Liam's, they had reunited by the end of 2015, just in time to dazzle the Hemsworth family Christmas party with ugly sweaters , and were back to being engaged by January 2016. \nBecause the couple that literally lights up a room together, might just belong together. \nSeriously, anything could still happen with these two twentysomethings, but the fact that they weathered a two-year breakup and came back looking ready to commit (and actually like an involved couple with stuff in common this time around) suggests that they could be the real deal. \n\"Of course it was hard, man,\" Hemsworth told GQ last summer . \"But at the time we were going in different directions and it's just what needed to happen. We were both super young and it was a good decision at the time—we both needed that.\" \nListen to the wise 27-year-old. He knows of which he speaks.
