The midfielder plies his trade in the Hungarian top tier and certainly caught everyone's eye on Saturday. Bartha improvises from the corner (Photo: AS TV) \n2-1 up against home side Debrecen, Paksi SE win a corner in the 84th minute. \nAfter coming on as a substitute 13 minutes prior, Bartha well and truly puts himself in the mix. A clean connection helps Bartha score (Photo: AS TV) \nAnd it pays off, Bartha latches onto the set-piece flicking his heel at the ball sending it into the far corner of the goal. \nIt's an outstanding effort, and well worthy of a Puskas Award nomination. poll loading Is Laszlo Bartha's goal the best back-heel volley you've ever seen? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T19:12:13.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
