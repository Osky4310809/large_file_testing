Beneficiaries would now receive a 4% interest subsidy on a loan of up to Rs 9 lakh, and 3% for a loan of up to Rs 12 lakh.\nThis means that if a beneficiary takes a housing loan of up to Rs 9 lakh with an interest rate of 9%, their EMIs would be calculated at 5%. If the loan is up to Rs 12 lakh and the interest rate 9%, the effective rate would be 6%.\nAccording to quick calculations, the 4% subsidy on a loan of Rs 9 lakh would translate to a discount of Rs 1,98,300 on the principal amount. The EMIs on a loan taken for 15 years would come down from Rs 9,128 to Rs 7,117 .\nThe government already provides a subsidy of 6.5%on home loans of up to Rs 6 lakh under the Prime Minister Awas Yojana (PMAY).\nYouths tune into the Prime Minister’s speech at a Mumbai club. (PTI photo)\nNational Housing Bank (NHB) managing director Sriram Kalyan Raman had told TOI that there was a great demand for loan from economically weaker sections. NHB is the nodal agency for disbursing the subsidy to borrowers through banks and non-banking financial companies under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme.\nIn Saturday’s address, Modi also said that the target for the number of houses to be built for the rural poor under PMAY had been enhanced by 33%. Furthermore, rural families who have a house but want to expand it would get a loan of up to 2 lakh with a 3% interest subsidy , he added.\nThe government has rolled out a scheme to build one crore houses for the rural poor with an investment of Rs 81,975 crore by 2018-19. The government had initially targeted to build three crore houses, but the target was reduced due to a fund crunch. – Prabhakar Sinha (TNN)\n(With inputs from Nauzer Bharucha from Mumbai)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T07:02:16.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
