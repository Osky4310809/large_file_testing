By Robert Purchese Published 21/02/2017 \nSquare Enix has announced a new role-playing IP codenamed Project Prelude Rune. It's the first game by new Japanese team Studio Istolia, where Hideo Baba, who was producer of the Tales series of games for Namco Bandai, is in charge. \nWhat little information there is on Project Prelude Rune comes from a Google translation of a new Studio Istolia website via Kotaku . Concept art shows a fantasy world of dragons and nature, so what looks to be a classic, magical tale. An extra piece of art from a press release, shared on Japanese site Gamer , shows a sketch of a typical battle. There are lots of wings. Royal blood Gods, war, and the Queen Sacrifice. \nNo platforms or release dates are mentioned and, what with the studio hiring, Project Prelude Rune sounds like it is a long way away. \nIn Tales land, meanwhile, Tales of Berseria has just landed on PC and PS4. It's the first game in the 21-year-old series to feature a sole, female protagonist. Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.
