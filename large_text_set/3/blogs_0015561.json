We’re are currently expanding into other areas of the country and will soon be distributed throughout the eastern part of the US. Since appearing on Shark Tank we’ve seen a 376% increase in sales. Daymond’s Mentorship A post shared by Me & the Bees Lemonade (@mikailasbees) on Mar 24, 2015 at 6:16pm PDT \nMikaila: \nDaymond is awesome! He’s visited Austin several times and we had so much fun each time he’s been here. He’s really funny and it’s cool that he has two daughters that I can play with some times. We talk, email and text often. He’s really happy and enjoys what he does. He’s also really serious and he’s helped met me into places that I would have without his help. I love having him as a partner. I’m so excited to be working with him. \nTheo: \nDaymond’s been a tremendous partner in helping us to understand the market, introducing us to new partners and guiding us through the expansion process. We’ve also learned a great deal about branding and brand development. We’re fortunate to be working with the expert. We’ve seen phenomenal growth already but we’re currently working with Daymond on some expansion opportunities that will be a tremendous boost to Mikaila’s efforts to save the bees. Daymond’s Involvement A post shared by Me & the Bees Lemonade (@mikailasbees) on Mar 21, 2015 at 9:56am PDT \nTheo: \nWe speak to Daymond regularly giving him updates on the status of the company. We also utilize the time to get a better understanding of business strategy over all. He’s also great about keeping us focused and moving forward. Couldn’t ask for a better partner. Advice for Future Contestants A post shared by Me & the Bees Lemonade (@mikailasbees) on Mar 12, 2015 at 8:55pm PDT \nMikaila: \nBig ideas start small so don’t be intimidated by the larger companies that you see present on the show. You can grow into a million dollar company, you don’t have to be one to present to the Sharks…It’s an awesome experience. If you have an opportunity, DO IT! \nTheo: \nKnow your numbers. It breeds confidence in an investor and helps move you into strategy discussions more quickly.
