It follows a team of Cold War-era (of course it’s Cold War era) guardians — Ler, Ursus, Khan and Xenia — whose powers supposedly reflect the strengths and traditions of the people of the Soviet Union. Their mission is to fight and destroy August Kuratov, who, if you squint, kind of looks like Bane.\nWe don’t know whether it’ll be any good, but what we do know is that it features a grizzly bear going fucking nuts with a high-powered machine gun. If that isn’t enough to give the trailer a watch, then we don’t know what is.\nGuardians is set for release in Russia some time in February, but there’s no word yet of a U.S. or European premiere. Check out the latest trailer above, then the previous two below.\n\n\nIn other movie news, this Apple Watch stand looks like a mini retro Macintosh computer.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T13:29:19.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
