In the end, both sides got at least part of what they wanted. \nThe city’s Cultural Resources Office had recommended that the board approve Qooba’s plan even though the mosque would be at the rear of the site instead of at the corner, as required by historic district rules. \nIn its report, the office’s staff said “concern regarding the safety of the congregants is the reason the (Qooba Foundation) seeks an exception to the requirement that the building be located at the street and on the corner.” Qooba’s plan places the mosque — angled to face Mecca — at the rear of the site, with parking in front. \nThe Cultural Resources Office report had urged construction of a brick perimeter wall next to the site’s sidewalks to screen the parking from view and to continue “the building lines of the block.” \nMembers of the mosque’s congregation and neighborhood residents agreed Monday that the recommended 8-foot-high brick wall was a bad idea. \nTim Kaminiski, Qooba Foundation’s president, told board members such a wall would likely be a target of vandals. Other congregation members said they preferred a lower wall or no wall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:32:09.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
