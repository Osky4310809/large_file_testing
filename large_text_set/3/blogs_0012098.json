Yes, Chris Evans is pretty much an actual superhero .\nMarvel Studios We’re so lucky to live in a time where Chris Evans has Twitter and uses it for good, not evil. Over the past year, he’s taken down David Duke of the KKK and even called out actions made by President Trump. When he sees injustice, he takes a stand. Just look at some of these gems.\nHere’s Chris telling David Duke (who has since been suspended from Twitter) that love is stronger than hate. Wow, did Chris just somehow get even *more* attractive?\nI don't hate them. That's YOUR method. I love. Try it. It's stronger than hate. It unites us. I promise it's in you under the anger and fear https://t.co/RGnH4rrblq \n— Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 13, 2017 Chris also took a second to voice his support for the LGBTQ community after the Trump administration sent out a letter rescinding transgender bathroom freedoms.\nTo the LGBTQ community, I'm sorry for the message that was sent today. They don't speak for all of us. We love you.\n— Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 23, 2017 But what if stating his beliefs loses him fans — or even upcoming roles? According to Chris, he’s willing to take that risk for what he believes in. Talking to Esquire in a recent interview, Chris explains :\n“Look, I’m in a business where you’ve got to sell tickets. But, my God, I would not be able to look at myself in the mirror if I felt strongly about something and didn’t speak up. I think it’s about how you speak up. We’re allowed to disagree. If I state my case and people don’t want to go see my movies as a result, I’m okay with that.” Captain America will next appear in Avengers: Infinity War which will be in theaters on May 4, 2018. Until then, Chris will probably keep fighting the good fight on Twitter and standing against injustice. And we’ll keep loving him for it!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:09:31.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
