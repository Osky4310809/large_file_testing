Advertisement \nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, plans are being finalized for Gaga to take the headlining spot that was once occupied by Beyoncé, on April 15 and 22nd. Beyoncé will be doing Coachella in 2018 to make up for the fact that she’s following doctor’s orders to sit down for a second and rest. \nOrganizers of the music festival felt strongly about replacing King Bey with another female performer, sources told THR . The last woman to headline Coachella was Björk in 2007, so this is very big stuff, indeed.

Will there be pianos and silks and horses and stuff? How many dancers will she have? Costume changes? Pyrotechnics? Gaga with just a piano? We will find out in April. \n[ The Hollywood Reporter ] \nRihanna made her way to Harvard this week to accept the Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian Award. Unsurprisingly, she looked fucking fantastic and gave a killer speech to boot (skip ahead to the 1:16:00 mark to see it in full). \n“You don’t have to be rich to help somebody,” she said in her speech. “You don’t gotta be famous. You don’t even have to be college-educated...It starts with your neighbor, the person right next to you, the person sitting next to you in class, the kid down the block in your neighborhood, you just do whatever you can to help in any way that you can.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:18:39.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
