The source of the anger is an episode that aired on Jan. 17, in which main character Kenny O'Neal equates bisexuality to having \"webbed toes\" or \"money problems.\" Not only did Ramirez play the inimitable (and bisexual) Callie Torres on Grey's Anatomy for nearly a decade, but she also came out as bisexual herself during a powerful speech in Oct. 2016. Ramirez started her beef with the situation by first tweeting out a link to a petition that seeks to end biphobia and bi-erasure on the show. She then made the matter personal in the sentiments that followed. And as someone who worked 4 them 4 10 years+,am truly disheartened & disappointed quite frankly.I will invest my brand where I'm respected. https://t.co/NQQAPDsFlU \n— Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 Dear @ABCNetwork @TheRealONeals :own it,address it,clarify it,empower our #Queer #Bisexual youth & community w/accurate positive reflections \n— Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 & while @PFLAG response was amazing,where is network's response?The actor's response wasn't enough 4 me. @ABCNetwork was in the same room. https://t.co/AwjPWPJk5B \n— Sara Ramirez (@SaraRamirez) February 16, 2017 \nAs Ramirez mentions, PFLAG (Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), who partnered with ABC on this particular episode, issued an apology for the situation . While Ramirez suggests that Noah Galvin (who plays Kenny) apologized as well, any tweets addressing the conflict seem to be absent from his Twitter account. (He did, however, seem to respond to a fan who tweeted about the issue.) This isn't the first time the ABC comedy has been embroiled in drama. Last June, Galvin landed in hot water after an incendiary interview with Vulture went viral. Currently, all the involved parties have yet to respond to Sara Ramirez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:44:23.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
