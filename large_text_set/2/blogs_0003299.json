Later that night, her father found her body in the weeds near their Howard Beach home. \nInvestigators found DNA on her body, but it did not match anyone in the data banks. \nEarlier this week, her parents, Phil and Cathy Vetrano, asked the state to allow familial DNA testing , which allows investigators to see if a suspect’s relative is in the DNA system, potentially leading them to the killer. \nAt this time, no charges have been filed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:51:02.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
