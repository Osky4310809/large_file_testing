According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), RBR Meat Company has recalled about 21,200 pounds of the pizza in fear of a possible Listeria contamination. \nThe Marketside pizza is produced exclusively for Walmart and was shipped to distribution centers in California, Utah, Washington, and Nevada. The recalled pizzas were produced on February 23rd and carry the product code 20547. An RBR supplier representative told the Huffington Post that about 6,700 sold pizzas were affected, so if you recently purchased a Marketside pizza, throw it out immediately or return it to the place you purchased it.
