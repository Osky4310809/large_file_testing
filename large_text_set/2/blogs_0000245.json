The woman was found safely, and a man was arrested in connection to the incident. (Johnston County 9-1-1) The call came in to the Johnston County, N.C., 911 center at about 4 a.m. On the other end of the line was a woman.\nIn a recording of the call, she does not immediately respond to a dispatcher who answered, ABC News reported, but she does seem upset.\nFinally, the woman says: “I need — I need help.”\nThe emergency dispatch center in North Carolina would be able to help the woman — who according to local reports had been locked in the trunk of a car that was going down a highway — but not by talking her through the Jan. 14 emergency in a traditional way.\nJason Barbour, director of the Johnston County Emergency 911 Communications Center, told ABC that the woman’s call dropped and attempts to get her back on the line were unsuccessful.\nBarbour said a supervisor, Tim Medlin, eventually figured out a way to help — by sending the woman text messages from the office’s emergency cellphone.\nThe 911 phone call between the original dispatcher and the victim in the incident lasts about two minutes and 15 seconds, according to a recording provided to The Washington Post.\n“Okay, ma’am, I need you to talk to me so that I can get help to you,” the dispatcher says.\nThe woman’s response, though, is somewhat difficult to hear.\n“Hello?” the dispatcher says again.\n“I’m inside of the trunk,” the woman says, her voice shaking.\nThe dispatcher asks how he can help and tells the woman that she needs to talk.\n“I am inside of a car trunk,” she says, this time more clearly.\n“You’re what?” he responds.\nShe repeats her answer. The dispatcher asks her if she knows what kind of car she’s in.\nHer response is unintelligible, at least on the recording.\nHe asks her where it happened.\nIn Raleigh, she tells him.\nDid she see who put her in the trunk?\nAgain, that response is unintelligible on the recording.\nThen the phone call ends, apparently disconnected.\n“The only thing we knew is it was a female that was very upset, and that she was in the trunk of the car,” Medlin, the supervisor, told WRAL .\nThe emergency center tried calling back but didn’t have any success, local reports indicate. Then, WRAL reported, Medlin thought he’d try to text her. He sent the woman a message, asking if she could text with him. She replied that she could.\n“It’s my boyfriend he’s so mad he said I danced on guys at a club,” the texts read, according to a transcript included in an event report. “Help me.”\nPart of a Johnston County 911 event report. The woman texted the type of car that she was in. He asked if the driver was taking her to “fay,” apparently short for Fayetteville, a city in another county. The woman texted the dispatcher that the driver had stopped, and she had to go. According to NBC , a cellphone carrier also helped law enforcement in the effort by tracking the phone location.\nBarbour, the communications center director, told The Washington Post that the dispatch center can receive texts from people in an emergency, but it can’t initiate a conversation that way.\n“The issue here was, our current technology is limited, in that we have to wait for the citizen to text us first, before we can get into a text conversation using 911,” Barbour said. “So we had the need to start the conversation, and we couldn’t do it with our 911 system. So that’s when he went and picked up the telephone, the cellphone, to actually text this lady.”\nThe woman was found, and a man was arrested in connection with the incident, according to reports . A public information officer for the Fayetteville Police Department did not immediately return a telephone message from The Post on Tuesday.\n“They located her,” Medlin told WRAL. “It was a good feeling to know she was located.”\nRead More:\nPolice use DNA to solve 1976 murder of Karen Klaas, ex-wife of Righteous Brothers singer\nA family has searched for a missing woman for months.
