That led to the firing of Baalke and coach Chip Kelly as York set to overhaul the operation after the struggles the past few years. \nThe 49ers made three straight trips to the NFC title game from 2011-13 under coach Jim Harbaugh, but got rid of him after an 8-8 season in 2014, in part because of a rift with Baalke. Jim Tomsula lasted one year as coach and then Kelly was also fired after one season, leading to this current search. \nYork said he was open to hiring either the coach or general manager first. He said the primary goal in the search is finding a coach and general manager who can work well together. \nAll signs point to Atlanta offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan getting the head coach job. He had a second interview with York this weekend and is the only remaining candidate. He can’t sign a contract with San Francisco until after the Falcons play the Super Bowl next Sunday against New England. \nLynch played for Shanahan’s father, Mike, for four seasons in Denver. \nYork also gave second interviews this weekend to the two other general manager candidates: Minnesota assistant GM George Paton and Arizona vice president of player personnel Terry McDonough. \nBut after meeting with them and Shanahan, York decided to go with Lynch for the job. Lynch played the final four years of his career in Denver, where Shanahan’s father, Mike, was head coach. \nLynch will need to rebuild a depleted roster that has few building blocks and holes at nearly every position. The biggest void is at quarterback where Colin Kaepernick and Blaine Gabbert both struggled this past season and can leave as free agents in March. \nSan Francisco has the No. 2 overall draft pick and plenty of salary cap room to make additions. \n___ \nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T04:51:04.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
