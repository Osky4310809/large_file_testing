The \"bespoke\" options for men range from $525 to $650.\nCommerce Sec.

Elizabeth Warren, it seemed absurd that one would wear slippers to a pretty important event ... or even outside of the house for that matter. And it crossed some minds that perhaps a person with so much money should be putting it toward something more worthwhile?\n. @CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself.\n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 27, 2017\nNewly confirmed Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross is wearing a pair of black felt slippers.
