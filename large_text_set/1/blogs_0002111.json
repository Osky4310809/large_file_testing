Coach Floyd is a valuable asset to our school district and community. We will no longer sit idly by and watch as innocent, hard-working employees are subjected to such treatment as Coach Floyd (and others before him) is enduring. We also feel it to be a cowardly move on the part of the Board to not allow a Public Comments section to the Special Meeting called for Thursday, January 5, at 5:45 PM. We respectfully ask the Board to not suspend Coach Floyd and to show their support for him by voting NO . Please sign and share this petition, and also be present at the meeting Thursday night. We stand with Coach Floyd!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T18:55:14.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
