Some aren't so great or are the same old thing, but others are novel, fun, and bring something new to the table. For this video, we spent a couple of days exploring the show floor to find some of the best Apple accessories of CES 2017. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Incipio showed off a new iPhone 7 case that brings back the headphone jack . The case itself is rather thin, but there is a large chin at the bottom to accommodate both the headphone jack and and a Lightning charging port. Griffin displayed its BreakSafe cables for the MacBook and MacBook Pro . The cables, including a new 100W model for the 2016 MacBook Pro, are designed to replace Apple's MagSafe connector, offering the same breakaway functionality over USB Type-C. Henge Docks debuted a number of products to complement the new MacBook Pro. The original Vertical Dock allows you to dock your computer off to the side of a monitor, while the new Horizontal Dock allows you to securely dock the MacBook Pro without compromising usability. The Horizontal Dock features pressure sensors to know when the computer is present, and it then automatically connects itself with the computer. This dock has 13 ports available including HDMI, USB Type-A, and Ethernet. Henge Docks also announced the Tethered Dock, which gives you a station to connect multiple cables and charge your MacBook. CMRA showed off a prototype Apple Watch band that features a front and rear-facing camera, but it didn't have a functional model on hand. We only saw a dummy unit, so we'll have to wait to see the band in action. The CMRA is already available for pre-order, but won't ship out until later this year. Finally, NanoLeaf displayed its colorful array of Aurora lights. These HomeKit-enabled lights can be displayed on a wall and each individual light can be controlled through the Aurora app. NanoLeaf also demoed the new Aurora Rhythm sound sensor that allows the lights to react to music and sound. If you missed them, make sure to check out the videos we did at CES Unveiled and Pepcom , two events that had tons of cool Apple products.
