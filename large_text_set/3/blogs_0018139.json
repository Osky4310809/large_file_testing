By: Manas Tiwari | New Delhi | Updated: March 19, 2017 6:12 PM Uttar Pradesh election 2017: As Yogi Adityanath was being sworn in, Cheteshwar Pujara was playing one of the most important knocks of India’s cricketing season. (Source: PTI) \nOn Sunday, while most people in India were busy with their usual lives, two men were making all the headlines but in two different battlefields and for two completely different reasons. Yogi Adityanath was finally sworn-in as the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh despite a mixed reaction from various sectors of the country. His oath-taking ceremony was no less than a festival with all the big political leaders coming under one roof as BJP captured the most politically important state of India, Uttar Pradesh. There was a wave of enthusiasm among the people who were present at the event and Yogi Adityanath’s followers danced and sang throughout the day. \nYou may also want to watch: \nOn the other hand, in a different part of the country, on a calm Sunday afternoon with Sun at its peak, Cheteshwar Pujara was playing one of the most important knocks of India’s cricketing season. The fans were not dancing as they would for MS Dhoni’s sixes neither were thrilled like they are when Virat Kohli is tormenting the opposition. The ground was in complete silence with frequent claps everytime Pujara sent a ball past the boundary rope. He scored 202 runs from 525 balls with a strike-rate of just 38.48 which was least among the batsmen who faced more than 25 balls. Yet, this was the most beautiful and appreciated knocks for India in last 12 months. And, not to forget that Virat Kohli has scored 4 double-centuries in this period while Karun Nair scored a record triple-century. Congratulations to Yogi Adityanath Ji, Keshav Prasad Maurya Ji, Dinesh Sharma Ji & all those who took oath today. Best wishes for serving UP \n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 19, 2017 \nRight after Adityanath took oath as the new Chief Minister of UP, came a tweet from Harsh Goenka, Chairman of RPG Enterprises that clearly mentioned his expectations from Adityanath. The tweet read as, “#CheteshwarPujara innings was like a #Yogi – calm, determined, meditative and disciplined. Let’s hope now Yogi plays like Pujara. #UP.” It was the aptest comparison one could have made. Even though Murali Vijay is called Monk within the Indian team, its Cheteshwar Pujara’s personality that reflects it the most. #CheteshwarPujara innings was like a #Yogi – calm, determined, meditative and disciplined. Let’s hope now Yogi plays like Pujara. #UP \n— Harsh Goenka (@hvgoenka) March 19, 2017 \nIn one of his interviews captain, Virat Kohli was asked who is the most innocent player in the team and the answer was simple, Cheteshwar Pujara. Kohli said he hasn’t met a more innocent person in his life than Pujara. Sometimes, it is hard to believe that a person with such a simple personality not just faces the aggressive oppositions like Australia with ease but also answers them with the bat perfectly. \nYou may also want to watch: \nHowever, Yogi Adityanath’s personality doesn’t completely go with his name. He is an aggressive man who doesn’t hold his words back. He has openly attacked Mother Teresa for being a part of a conspiracy to Christianize India and went on record to say there is no difference between Shah Rukh Khan and Hafiz Saeed. Right or wrong is a different debate altogether but to expect a similar conduct from the man who wears ‘RayBan’ goggles in public and has the ‘swag’ of a dynamic leader is not right, to be honest. \nREAD | Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav steal a joyful moment with PM Modi as a grim Yogi Adityanath watches from stage \nYogi Adityanath was sworn-in in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah and Chief Ministers of almost every NDA-led state, Cheteshwar Pujara, on the other hand, batted in front of a few spectators but that doesn’t decrease the value of his achievement. Sometimes, the preparations and celebrations are not important, you just need to get the task done because that’s what matters! We only hope that Yogi Adityanath understands this.
