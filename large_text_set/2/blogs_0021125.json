According to David Anderson of the Daily Mirror , Ibrahimovic is ‚Äúreluctant to go a second season without playing in the world‚Äôs most prestigious club competition.‚Äù It‚Äôs added that the 2017-18 term is likely to be the striker‚Äôs last in European football before he makes the switch to Major League Soccer. ‚ÄúChampions League football is hugely important to him, and he does not want to miss out on it in what is likely to be his final campaign,‚Äù the report continued. The Red Devils are in sixth place in the Premier League. They can qualify for the Champions League by finishing fourth, which they trail by two points, or winning the UEFA Europa League, in which United are in the final 16. Although the Champions League has plenty of benefits, keeping Ibrahimovic sated and at the club will be top of the agenda for a lot of United fans. These numbers from Squawka Football show just how crucial he‚Äôs been: Squawka Football @Squawka Zlatan Ibrahimovic has now been directly involved in 28 goals in 35 games for Man Utd. 22 goals 6 assists Not bad for a 35-year-old... üòè https://t.co/sWz8fTCABn 2/16/2017, 9:42:16 PM Ibrahimovic signed for United on a free transfer in the summer after four memorable years with PSG. Per Anderson, he agreed a one-year deal, although there is the opportunity to extend for a second term. In the piece it‚Äôs suggested Ibrahimovic was happy to include the option ‚Äúbecause he felt their absence from the Champions League would be temporary.‚Äù Ibrahimovic has been a big hit at United. Dan Mullan/Getty Images If the Red Devils are to breach the top four or win the Europa League, you sense Ibrahimovic will have a lot to do with it. The 35-year-old has led the line with distinction since his arrival, dominating defenders, bringing team-mates into play and chipping in with plenty of crucial goals. Bleacher Report‚Äôs Alex Dunn suggested that despite his relatively short time at the football club, Ibrahimovic is already the main man: Bleacher Report UK @br_uk Wayne Rooney is staying at #mufc, but he‚Äôll have to watch the club‚Äôs real leader at work #Zlatan | @AlDunn80 https://t.co/M8l0J2QSSV https://t.co/XzpMSlnF6F 2/24/2017, 4:00:27 PM United manager Jose Mourinho has made his intent clear to keep Ibrahimovic at the football club, stating in December that the extension ‚Äúis activated in his brain and it is activated also in my decisions and in the owners' and the board‚Äôs,‚Äù per Paul Vinnell of Sky Sports. However, as noted by Anderson, Ibrahimovic was more coy when quizzed recently over his future and insisted we‚Äôll have to ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù what happens. Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Despite his advancing years, it‚Äôs easy to see why the Red Devils want to keep Ibrahimovic around. Per Daniel Storey of Football365, he‚Äôs been very durable throughout his career: Daniel Storey @danielstorey85 Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 830th career match last night. He has missed 34 games through injury in nine years. 2/23/2017, 10:28:02 AM Indeed, the evergreen Ibrahimovic looks like he‚Äôs capable of continuing at the highest level for many years yet. The Premier League is notorious for its physicality and frantic tempo, but the former Sweden international has made the division look easy. With his charisma and goals, he‚Äôs adored at Old Trafford. His desire to showcase his talent at the highest level is understandable, though. For all the major league titles Ibrahimovic has won, he‚Äôs yet to lift the Champions League in his distinguished career. United will be hoping they can give him the chance to win the prize next term.
