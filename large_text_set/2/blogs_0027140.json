Two tests, scheduled for June and November, will be canceled, it said. \nThe board said that it will also step up security audits of testing centers. \nQi Lianshan, who has worked for several SAT prep services over the past decade and is now a self-employed SAT tutor in Beijing, said the decision could affect those who had planned to take the test in June the most. \nJune is an ideal time for students to take the SAT because they usually start submitting applications for undergraduate programs in the second half of the year. In May, they are still busy taking Advanced Placement tests, also administered by the College Board. \n\"Now the students may have to take both AP tests and the SAT in May, which means a lot more pressure and less possibility of achieving a high score,\" he said, adding that students who plan to take the SAT next year should modify their preparations to secure a good result. \nSi Mingxia, director of the US division at Vision Overseas, an agency under New Oriental Education and Technology Group that helps Chinese study overseas, said the move by the College Board could be a step to thwart rampant cheating and unfair competition. \nThe College Board did not respond to a request for comment. Its chief administrative officer and general counsel, Peter Schwartz, said in a statement last week, \"We are unwavering in our commitment to SAT test security and we will continue to confront any efforts to undermine it.\" \nIn 2015, prosecutors in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia charged 15 Chinese citizens over a conspiracy to have impostors take the SAT and other college entrance exams for other students for payment of up to $6,000. Most of the defendants pleaded guilty and were deported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:28:47.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
