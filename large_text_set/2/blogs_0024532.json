Although day one patches and possible \"booster packs\" (like faster load times and the like) are a possibility, you won't have any space issues if you're going solely physical. It's not like we expected there to be mandatory installs with a cartridge, but confirmation is always nice. \nGoing physical is particularly easy to do on the Switch at launch, as a ton of developers are releasing physical editions, even for ports.
