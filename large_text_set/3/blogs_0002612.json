Wenger has come under another wave of scrutiny (Photo: Getty) Sanchez provided an assist for Welbeck (Photo: Reuters) Read More \n\"It is one of your biggest games of the season and you leave your best player on the bench. If the Arsenal manager was trying to prove some sort of point to Alexis Sanchez it backfired badly. \n\"He ended up giving further ammunition to those who would like to see him leave.\" \nShearer also slammed Wenger's decision to hold fire on his decision over a new contract decision, believing that is sending out the wrong message. The banners were out again at Anfield (Photo: Reuters) \n\"They appear to be a club that does not know where it is going, what it wants to do. They are in a kind of footballing limbo,\" Shearer continues. \n\"That is not being helped by the manager’s refusal to commit to a new deal . . . making it a bit rich if he has a problem with Sanchez doing the same.
