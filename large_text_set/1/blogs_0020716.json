Asim Kieta is seen during his arraignment Monday in South Boston District Court. (WBZ-TV) \nProsecutors charged 42-year-old Asim Kieta with possession of an explosive device and assault with intent to murder, among other charges, during his arraignment Monday morning in South Boston District Court. Not-guilty pleas were entered on his behalf. Flames near a Boston Police cruiser in South Boston.

Prosecutor: “This was a deliberate attack against a police officer.” \n— KarynRegal (@Karynregal) January 23, 2017 \n\nWBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Karyn Regal reports Kieta had one family member in the courtroom. That family member told WBZ he has not seen Kieta in a long time. \nProsecutors said Kieta has four restraining orders against him by family members, including his sister. \nKieta’s attorney said in court it appears this was a discarded propane tank that caught fire, adding the case against his client is “a witch hunt.” Asim Kieta’s lawyer says this all sounds like a discarded propane tank caught fire, calls this a “witch hunt”. \n“It sounds like there was some trash caught fire in a gutter,” defense attorney Thomas Menton said. \nIf Kieta makes bail, he will be required to wear a GPS device. \nHis next court appearance is scheduled for February 2. \nKieta was previously a driver for Uber. A company spokesman said in a statement Monday that Kieta was let go earlier this month, but would not explain the reason why he was no longer working for the online ride service. \nBoston Police Commissioner William Evans said he doesn’t know the motive, but noted that the homeless suspect has a criminal past. In court Monday, it was learned that Kieta’s probation record is sealed. Evans says Kieta apparently acted alone and the explosion does not appear to be part of a wider plot. \nEvans says surveillance video helped police track down Kieta, who was arrested Saturday night in Charlestown. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
