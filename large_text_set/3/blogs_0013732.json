Atop Babcock’s keys to victory should be slowing Marchand, who on Monday earned NHL First Star of the Week honors for his performance last week. \nMarchand is having a career season and has entered the Hart Trophy conversation with his play of late. In his last five games, the Bruins winger has seven goals and four assists, a stretch in which Boston has won four games. Marchand’s 37 goals are three behind Sidney Crosby for the league lead, and he’s only one point behind Crosby and Connor McDavid for the league lead in points. \nBabcock saw Marchand’s continued evolution firsthand before the 2016-17 season began as head coach of Team Canada. Marchand, playing alongside Crosby and B’s teammate Patrice Bergeron, posted 5-3-8 totals in six games while helping the Canadians to a gold medal. \nBabcock jokingly took credit for Marchand’s success Monday while also heaping plenty of praise on the Boston agitator. Mike Babcock says Brad Marchand is a top-three player in the NHL right now: \"No one's driving his team harder.\" \n— Chris Johnston (@reporterchris) March 19, 2017 \nBabcock probably wouldn’t mind if Marchand slowed things down for one night at least.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:28:20.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
