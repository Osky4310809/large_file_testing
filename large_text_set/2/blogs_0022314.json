The findings showed that high test scores at age 11 are linked to an increased likelihood of regular drinking and cannabis use. Giphy \nInterestingly, though the British teens in the study were more likely to drink and smoke pot, they were also less likely to smoke cigarettes. \nAt first glance, this research might make you think the more clever students are simply more willing to temporarily experiment than others. \nHowever, study authors James Williams and Gareth Hagger-Johnson say these patterns of substance use may continue as young adolescents grow into full-blown adults. \nAccording to Indy100 , they said, \nThese associations persist into early adulthood, providing evidence against the hypothesis that high academic ability is associated with temporary ‘experimentation’ with substance abuse.

To rank students academically, Williams and Hagger-Johnson used national test scores taken at age 11. \nDuring their early teens, high-scoring students were less likely to smoke cigarettes and more likely to drink alcohol than their peers with lower test scores. They were also slightly more likely to say they used cannabis. Giphy \nAs they entered their late teen years, clever students were more than twice as likely to regularly drink alcohol, yet they also showed less of a tendency to binge-drink. \nDuring this same period in their lives, the students with higher scores were nearly twice as likely to use cannabis persistently and 50 percent more likely to use it occasionally, compared to their peers with lower test scores. \nThe study authors offered a potential explanation for this particular trend: \nHigher-ability adolescents are more open to try cannabis but are initially cautious of illegal substances in early adolescence as they are more aware of the immediate and long-term repercussions that breaking the law might incur. \nSo, the next time your parents give you a hard time when they catch you with a beer or a blunt in your hand (or both, if you’re ambitious), make sure you throw this article in their faces and tell them to suck it.
