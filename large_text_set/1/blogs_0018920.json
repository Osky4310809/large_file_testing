Lazy shops shouldn't win just because they made you laugh. \nPlease do not downvote submissions just because they do not have obvious potential. \nPlease report inappropriate content to the mods. \nphotoshopbattles' subreddits:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:34:21.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
