King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted an hour ago 5 \nBilly Corgan admitted Nirvana and Pearl Jam's early-'90s success had a strong emotional impact on him, reaching a point where he considered suicide. \nThe Smashing Pumpkins mastermind said on Why Not Now (via Alternative Nation ): \"The Smashing Pumpkins had put out one album [1991's ' Gish '], which was very successful [debuted at No. 195 in the US, ultimately sold over 1 million copies], but as we were out promoting our album, the Nirvana album came out, and as everyone knows ' Nevermind ' was a massive album. And then Pearl Jam came out too at that time, and they were massive. \n\"So within a short span of time I went from thinking I was very successful within my given field to all the rules had changed in my given field. Everything I had built myself up to be and do was no longer as relevant as it needed to be. \n\"I went into a very strange depression because I felt like something had been not taken, but the change made me feel kind of inadequate in a way I wasn't prepared for. \n\"I went through a very long depression where I could not write songs, and really struggled for a breakthrough. It really came off the heels of a suicidal depression, I just really struggled with the emotions I was feeling. I reached this kind of morning in my life where it was like I'm either going to jump out a window, or I was going to change my life. \n\"I know that sounds very dramatic, but that's literally what happened. I couldn't meditate on death anymore than I had. I'd even gotten to the point where - they say it's very troubling in suicide land if you start giving away your possessions -I'd already been through all those stages, I was giving away stuff, and planning my eulogy, and all sorts of weird self-absorbed things. \n\"I woke up one morning, and I kind of stared out the window and thought, 'Okay, well, if you're not going to jump out the window, you better do whatever it is you need to do.' That morning I wrote, I think it was the song ' Today ' [the second single off 1993's ' Siamese Dream '] which people would probably be fairly familiar with, it's the ice cream truck video song. \"It's sort of a wry observation on suicide, but in essence the meditation behind the lyric is that every day is the best day, if you let it be. So much of life is about perception, you can have mastery over a lot of things, your career, people even have power over their family sometimes, money, you realize that if you don't have your mind right, none of these things matter.\"I would put that more in a spiritual category, but the point is perception really does guide how one takes in reality, and then in turn how one succeeds in reality, because without proper perspective, success only becomes like a snake that eventually eats you up too.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:53:59.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
