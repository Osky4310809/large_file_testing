Porn Star Christy Mack Testifying in War Machine Attempted Murder Trial Video Former CIA Director: I Believe ‘WikiLeaks is Acting as an Arm, as an Agent, of the Russian Federation’ by Justin Baragona | 6:00 pm, March 8th, 2017 Gen. Michael Hayden: I believe \"WikiLeaks is acting as an arm, as an agent, of the Russian federation\" https://t.co/J4ttUyYS29 \n— The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) March 8, 2017 \nThis afternoon, former CIA director Michael Hayden appeared on CNN to discuss both President Donald Trump’s unproven claims that former President Barack Obama wiretapped his phones and the recent news involving WikiLeaks releasing alleged details of the CIA’s spying methods. \nAt one point in the conversation, host Jake Tapper asked Hayden if he thought the timing of this dump by WikiLeaks was suspicious, specifically since Trump has praised WikiLeaks in the past and quite a few supporters of Trump have complained lately about the so-called ‘Deep State.’ \n“I must confess that the thought occurred to me,” he told Tapper. “But I would not suggest it is anything more than perhaps a potential hypothesis.” \nHe continued, “I don’t know that the Russians actually committed the theft. This may be what WikiLeaks said it was, an insider. But with regard to the timing, I mean, look, I’m now pretty close to the position that WikiLeaks is acting as an arm, as an agent, of the Russian Federation.” \nAfter Tapper pressed him on whether he had proof of that claim, Hayden pointed out it was just his assumption based on what he’s seen over the past year. He also groused that he’d like to see WikiLeaks demand transparency from autocracies rather than “one of the world’s great democracies.” \nThe ex-CIA head has been a familiar face on television lately, having been interviewed by Stephen Colbert last night and appearing on Morning Joe earlier this week . \nWatch the clip above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:14:13.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
