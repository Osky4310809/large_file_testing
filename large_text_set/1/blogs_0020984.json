While many media were quick to debunk the jade egg practice, we wanted a full-spectrum, holistic view on whether naysaying OB/GYNs are perhaps taking this a bit too seriously or if there are legitimate risks associated with the egg. Plus, the interview on goop was with mbg's very own Shiva Rose , who is one of our experts on holistic skin care, among many other things. To get the truth, we consulted two doulas, a fertility expert and licensed acupuncturist, and an OB/GYN. Here's everything you need to know about putting a jade egg in your yoni. Pro: Interacting with your vagina can help you connect with your body. \n\"I am a fan of the yoni egg! Being open to exploring with this crystal gem gives a woman an opportunity to be more connected and attuned with her (yoni) body. I love all the benefits of the yoni egg from sexual pleasure to strengthening the vaginal walls. As a doula I recommend that my clients explore with the yoni egg after giving birth.\" — Paula Mallis , founder of WMN Space , doula, and fertility expert Con: It's probably not the best idea to sleep with one inside you. \n\"That being said, I personally would not leave ANYTHING in my vagina overnight. I would use the jade egg during daylight hours only.\" — Lindsey Bliss , doula and mother of seven \n\"One benefit of the jade egg is it helps women identify their pelvic floor muscles, which can be challenging for many women to find. Disadvantages of the jade egg are leaving it inside the vagina for extended periods of time, which can lead to overstimulating and stressing the pelvic floor muscles and vaginal infections.\" — Dr. Sherry A. Ross , OB/GYN, women's health expert Pro: Jade eggs don't have any artificial chemicals. \n\"I'm going to be honest and say that I've never actually tried a jade egg. I can't see how it could be a bad thing or even dangerous. The numerous chemicals that are in most tampons and maxi pads are far more dangerous to your health.\" — Lindsey Bliss ADVERTISEMENT Con: The jade egg could alter the pH of your yoni, causing an imbalance. \n\"I worry about this jade egg practice affecting the pH of the vagina. The vagina is an ecosystem, and there is a delicate balance of pH and good bacteria that create an optimal healthy environment down there. A healthy vaginal pH is slightly acidic, between 3.5 and 4.5, and when it becomes imbalanced you risk vaginal issues like itching or odor. Since your vagina is striking a delicate balance, simple things like your period, sex, lubricants, douches, or yes, foreign objects like jade eggs, may set it off balance.\" — Katherine Altneu , licensed acupuncturist and fertility expert Pro: Using the egg could help your vagina age better. \n\"She is definitely on the right track in wanting to improve the muscles of a woman's pelvic floor, which can be damaged by vaginal births, the aging process, and being overweight. The effect of weakening the pelvic floor results in your pelvic organs dropping, creating a bulge into your vagina and loss of urine.\" — Dr. Sherry A. Ross , OB/GYN, women's health expert Con: If you hold tension in your pelvic floor, like many people do, the egg might cause more unnecessary tension. \n\"I'm hesitant to endorse the jade egg as a practice. While it may improve muscle tone of the pelvic floor, some people have pelvic floor muscles that are too tight and cannot relax. A tight pelvic floor is far more common than people realize. Just as many people carry tension in their neck and shoulders, many other people carry tension in their pelvic floor—without even realizing it. This can be made worse by doing squeezing exercises and overworking the muscles without learning how to relax. I would only do these exercises if recommended by a physical therapist who specializes in the pelvic floor and can make sure you're doing the exercises properly for the condition of your pelvic floor.\" — Katherine Altneu , licensed acupuncturist and fertility expert So...is the jade egg worth trying? \nWe'll let you decide. Based on these expert opinions: If your vagina is generally healthy and not prone to infection, it might be worth a shot with your gynecologist's blessing, of course. If you're someone prone to BV, yeast infections, or have other issues with your sex organs, proceed with caution.
