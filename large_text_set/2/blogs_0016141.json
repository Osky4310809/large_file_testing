During his NBA All-Star Weekend press conference, commissioner Adam Silver was asked whether he believes the earth is flat.\nSilver used levity to answer.\n“Kyrie and I went to the same college,” Silver said, referring of his alma mater Duke. ”He may have taken some different courses than I did.”\nIrving claimed multiple times on Friday that he believes Earth is flat and also has some, uh, interesting thoughts on dinosaurs. On Saturday, Irving indicated it was all some sort of joke or commentary on alternative facts. Silver alluded to that in his comments and reiterated that he, Silver, believes Earth is round.\nSilver also discussed more substantive issues, including the league’s response to the Trump administration’s executive order on immigration, the Charles Oakley-Jim Dolan spat, and the NBA’s interest in expanding its presence in Africa.", "external_links": ["http://proxy.espn.com/video/clip?id=18713708"], "published": "2017-02-19T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:56:22.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
