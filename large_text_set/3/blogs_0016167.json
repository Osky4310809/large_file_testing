The recipients of the puppies weren’t clued in ahead of time, making the reactions all the more endearing.\n“Imagine this—you’re doing what you do on a regular day, bored out of your mind, and then suddenly you’re handed a pile of puppies,” actor Rainn Wilson, founder of SoulPancake, said in a statement . “Actually no need to imagine it, because we did this IRL. You’re welcome.”\nNot only will watching the video bring a guaranteed smile to your face, but every time you view it, Puppy Chow will donate one pound of their new Puppy Chow Natural formula to Rescue Bank, a non-profit organization that supports animal rescue and rehabilitation. They will be counting video views until April 23, and will donate up to 500,000 pounds of dog food.\nThis article originally appeared in Real Simple by Grace Elkus.\nRelated Articles \nCan Dogs Get the Flu?
