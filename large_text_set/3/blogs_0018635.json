Source: News Corp Australia \n“All the boys, it came as a massive shock to us. We obviously didn’t see that coming.” \nWoods admitted it was tough on the players — let alone the captain — to find out about the bombshell before being told by anyone at the club. \n“It was hard,” he said. \n“After the (Sunday) game JT and I did the press conference, and as we were walking back down the tunnel we were talking about things we could improve on throughout the week. \n“I went home on the bus, everyone was pretty filthy after the game, then woke up and going to recovery to switch on for the week and it hits you. \n“It was a massive shock.” \nWoods made comments on NRL 360 last week surrounding the contracts of the Tigers’ “big four” — Woods, Luke Brooks, Mitchell Moses, and James Tedesco — which he says were taken out of context. Taylor saga timeline 3:02 \nWoods had said he didn’t want to extend his contract until he knew who the coach was beyond 2017, which some people took to mean he wasn’t happy with Taylor at the helm. \n“Last week when I made those comments it wasn’t directed at JT to get rid of him,” Woods clarified. \n“I get along with JT really well. He’s the one who gave me my start as captain of the club and from there I’ve been in the rep sides consistently, so I can’t thank JT enough. \n“As players we just have to play footy, the coaches coach and the administrators administrate.” \nWoods wants one clear thing from his club right now. \n“Just a bit of direction,” he said. \n“At the moment we don’t know what we’re doing. We’ve got an interim coach in at the moment and as Justin said yesterday he’s going to take his time picking a coach.” Cleary open to Tigers job 5:30 \nThe Tigers are now in the process of finding a replacement for Taylor. \nOut-of-work experienced coach Ivan Cleary looms as the leading contender, but former club NYC coach Todd Payten has also been mentioned. \nWoods wouldn’t be drawn on picking a coach he would like to see appointed, and said he didn’t expect to be consulted by the club. \n“No idea,” he said. \n“I’ve met Ivan Cleary twice in here (Fox Sports). I’ve got no idea how he coaches, I’ve had one conversation with him in here. \n“I’m captain of the club but at the end of the day it comes down to the board and the CEO.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
