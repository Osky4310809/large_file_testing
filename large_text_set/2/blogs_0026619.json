Johnson breaks down 1st Test 5:43 \nIn just seven Tests, Virat Kohli and his team have gone to the third umpire on 55 occasions. \nOnly 17 times have they been proven right. \nThat leaves their success percentage at a woeful 30.9 per cent. \nThis shameful ratio was never more evident than in the series-opening Test in Pune, when openers Murali Vijay and KL Rahul burnt both of India’s reviews inside the first six overs of the second innings. \nNeither were sensible reviews, and both were lambasted by the commentary team of Shane Warne, Michael Clarke and Ravi Shastri. \nThat meant that by the time their best batsman, captain Virat Kohli, walked to the crease his team had no reviews until it refreshes at the 80-over mark. \n“It’s not there to say ‘let’s hope I get lucky’ and you cost your teammates. India’s use of the DRS has been pretty ordinary,” Warne said in commentary. \nHis view was supported by Shastri, who played 80 Tests for India. \n“India have had a shocker with the reviews,” Shastri said. \n“It’s so crucial in the fourth innings, they have to be careful. \n“How could Rahul review that one?” \nDespite the shockers from their openers, India saves their worst reviews for when they’re in the field. \nThey blew all four reviews when fielding in the first Test, and it hurt them badly. \nSteve Smith was on 73 when he jammed his bat and pad together to stop a ball delivered by Ravindra Jadeja. \nSmith was given the benefit of the doubt by the umpires, but had the option been there it would’ve been a wise review because replays showed the ball struck Smith’s pad first and Hawkeye would’ve shown three red lights. \nSmith went on to add a further 36 vital runs while sapping India of energy and confidence. \nOf the 42 reviews they’ve attempted in the past seven Tests, only 10 have been proven correct.
