But with the hectic schedules we all have, we either tend to forget, ignore, or just somehow end up consuming minimal amounts of water, or not at all. And that can really affect our bodily functions, and even lead to illness. So, until continuously making sure we drink enough water becomes ingrained in our daily routine, here are 5 easy ways to make sure we get enough hydration every day. Download an app to remind you, and keep track of your consumption \nThere are, now, a number of Apple and Android applications to help us keep track of our water consumption, and to remind us to drink glass after glass. And since our phones have a permanent place in our hands, this is a sure-shot way to help us drink more water. Set goals and make them fun in order to stick to them \nWhen it comes to drinking water every day, try and set attainable goals for yourself - like drinking at least four 500 ml bottles a day (it might seem like a lot, but when you start drinking, you'll realise how little it actually is). And to make sure you stick to these goals, make it like a game for yourself. If you drink as much (or more) water than you set out to each day, set up a tiny reward for yourself, or a punishment if you don't. If you include a friend or co-worker in this water drinking endeavour, it can be more fun. Eat foods with high water content \nFoods like zucchini, cucumber, tomato, watermelon, and strawberries have a high water content, but obviously do not completely take care of your body's daily water needs. So, make sure you eat these water-rich foods, but maybe chase them down with some good old H2O. Rehydrate yourself every time you do something you know is causing your body to lose water \nWhether it's a gym session, or an alcohol-binge, if you're aware of the fact that your body is losing water, make sure to keep drinking more to replenish whatever has been lost. Make sure to rehydrate every time you use the bathroom \nSince you've just expelled out water, it makes sense to rehydrate, doesn't it? So, make it a practice to drink at least a glass of water, each time you use the rest room.
