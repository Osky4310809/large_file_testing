And it is entirely manmade. The United Nations and South Sudanese government said 100,000 people are already suffering, and one million more are expected to face starvation soon. Food and Agriculture Organization representative Serge Tissot said, \"Our worst fears have been realized.\"\n\n\nThe United Nations said war and economic troubles are to blame for the famine, which has been officially declared in some areas of the Unity state but also threatens other parts of South Sudan. High food prices also make it harder for hungry people to obtain sufficient sustenance. Head of the World Food Programme (WFP) in South Sudan, Joyce Luma, said the famine is man-made - three years of strife has affected farmers and impacted crop production. Tissot said, \"Many families have exhausted every means they have to survive.\" \nRelated: Severe drought and El Ni√±o have put 32 million southern Africans in peril \nAccording to the WFP and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), 4.9 million people desperately need food in South Sudan - that's over 40 percent of the entire population. But that number could rise to 5.5 million people, or 47 percent of the population, by the summer, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).\nIPC's report said acute malnutrition is a public health emergency in the country, as 14 out of 23 counties show Global Acute Malnutrition around or greater than 15 percent. UNICEF representative Jeremy Hopkins said they estimate over one million children are acutely malnourished in South Sudan.\nThe report called for assistance, saying humanitarian help in 2016 was able to bolster and even improve food security in some areas. \"It is of paramount importance that assistance not only continues in 2017, but scales up in the face of mounting food insecurity across the country,\" the report states. But Luma warned there's only so much assistance can do without peace in South Sudan.\nVia the BBC and the United Nations \nImages via European Commission DG ECHO on Flickr ( 1 , 2 ) \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:14:46.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
