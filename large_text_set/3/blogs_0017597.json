In this file photo, President Rodrigo Duterte speaks at a gathering of local government officials in Manila, March 2017. Photo by Manman Dejeto/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines – His allies and the Palace may have been quick to defend President Rodrigo Duterte from an impeachment complaint and the possibility of a case before the International Criminal Court (ICC), but he does not seem to care less. \n\"I welcome both developments,\" said Duterte on Sunday, March 19, in a press conference at the Davao International Airport before he left for official visits to Myanmar and Thailand . \nLast Thursday, March 16, Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano filed the first impeachment complaint against Duterte, a day after Congress ended its first session. Duterte is accused of culpably violating the Constitution, engaging in bribery, betraying public trust, committing graft and corruption, and other high crimes.

This is a democracy,\" added the President. \nA war on drugs was one of Duterte's key election promises. \nAs soon as he was sworn into power, law enforcers led by the Philippine National Police (PNP) have launched a relentless crackdown on illegal drugs, and both its pushers and users. \nSince July 1, 2016, police have recorded more than 7,000 deaths linked to the drug war. These include more than 2,500 drug suspects killed in police operations. The cops have classified the rest as \"deaths under investigation\" or vigilante-style killings with possible links to illegal drugs. \nGovernment officials and allies of the Duterte administration have repeatedly rejected allegations that the killings are state-sponsored. \nFocus on work \nThe President was also unclear about whether or not he thinks Vice President Leni Robredo, who belongs to the once-ruling Liberal Party (LP), had a role in the impeachment complaint filed against him. \nDuterte's staunch ally, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, had claimed Robredo was behind the impeachment complaint. \nAlvarez is also considering filing an impeachment case against the Vice President. \n\"I will not be surprised if she is there, but I will not speculate if she is there,\" said Duterte, who appointed Robredo to his Cabinet only to instruct her months later to stop attending Cabinet meetings. Robredo subsequently stepped down as housing chief. \nThe LP was the country's dominant party for the 6 years of the Aquino administration. Robredo is now the party chairperson as its highest-elected member. \nDuterte, however, distanced himself from impeachment talks against Robredo, saying he does not want to \"tinker\" and instead would rather focus on fulfilling his promises as president. \nFor an impeachment complaint to progress, it must be approved by at least one-third of the House of Representatives, which is dominated by Duterte allies. It will then be transmitted to the Senate. \nAt least two-thirds of the Senate will then have to convict the President to remove him from office. The Senate majority bloc is led by Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, PDP-Laban president. (READ: FAST FACTS: How does impeachment work? ) – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
