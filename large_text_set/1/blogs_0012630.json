Toyota C-HR coming to Indonesia with 1.5L engine? / 38 comments \nIt appears that not only is the Toyota C-HR coming to Indonesia, it will also be assembled there , according to Indonesian automotive portal AutonetMagz . The publication quoted a source in product planning at Toyota Astra Motor who wished not to be named. \nWhat’s more, Indonesia will differ from other markets, which offer either a 115 PS/185 Nm 8NR-FTS 1.2 litre turbocharged engine matched to either a CVT or a six-speed manual, a 150 PS/193 Nm 2.0 litre naturally-aspirated mill with a CVT or a hybrid model that utilises a 98 PS/142 Nm 1.8 litre engine and a 72 PS/163 Nm electric motor. \nInstead, the archipelago will receive the same 1.5 litre 2NR-FE Dual VVT-i engine as the Sienta and recently revised Vios . In those models, the mill produces 107 PS at 6,000 rpm and 140 Nm at 4,200 rpm, mated to either a CVT or a five-speed manual. The source said that the car will also get minor exterior and interior revisions compared to other markets, similar to the Indonesian Sienta vis-à-vis the Japanese-market model. \nWhile it’s tempting to imagine the possibility of a 1.5 litre C-HR entering the market as a budget option, the reality is that our models will more likely be offered solely with the 2.0 litre mill in order to more squarely take on the Honda HR-V 1.8L and the Mazda CX-3 2.0L . \nGALLERY: Toyota C-HR at the 2017 Singapore Motor Show Research Toyota Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T15:06:27.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
