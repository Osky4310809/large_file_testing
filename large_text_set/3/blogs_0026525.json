Here's Takeuchi with the answer:\n\"It was a really fun idea, but we found people tended to tense up and hold their breath for real, making it very tiring to play! It was a great idea on paper, but we ditched it because we thought doing that for 15 hours would give people hypoxia.\"\nElsewhere in the documentary, director Koshi Nakanishi noted that there was originally an evil dog in the game. Not a monster type, but rather a single recurring enemy.\n\"One thing that I kind of wish we could have kept was that the family used to have a pet dog,\" he said. \"It was part of the dinner scene, I think. For one reason or another we had to cut it, which is a shame. Thinking back now, I wish we could have kept that.\"\n\"I forget its name,\" Nakanishi lamented. \"It was Diane or something.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAsMpq8FeJA"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:00:58.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
