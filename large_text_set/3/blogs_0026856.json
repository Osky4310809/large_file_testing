With Yogi in the saddle will UP-ites be able to do the new political yoga? With the ban on buffalo meat, folks in UP might have to forgo tunday kabab for paneer kabab and be forced to sing aa laut ke aaja mere meat. The path to power in UP was once through galli and mohalla but now it’s through math and mandir. What does this say about the temple of democracy? Janta janardhan hai!\nAnti-Romeo squads might mean a crackdown on romance, leaving UP’s lovers asking why they can’t be Lord Krishna with his gopis? Would Krishna’s playfulness with Radha be regarded as unlawful behaviour by the moral police? With so much religious hate around, it’s a good idea to love religiously. But there’s no scope anymore for Ishq Ishq Ishq in UP. Are the Uttar Pradesh police aware that to be anti-Romeo is to be anti a man who gave up his life for his love, namely Juliet?\nThe saffron clad Yogi Adityanath follows a long line of bachelor politicians who are married to their cause. From Jayalalithaa to Mamata Banerjee to Naveen Patnaik to Manoharlal Khattar to PM Modi these are (were) single-minded netas. Why do so many Indians vote in single file? Because too many netas have double vision when it comes to their own families. Single leaders don’t have to deal with shame and scandal in the family. The parivar though is another matter. Governance Yogi-style is certainly turning out to be quite singular.\nFor family-less netas, there’s less risk of the kitchen cabinet or of in-laws becoming out-laws. Sometimes politics becomes a mom and pop shop forcing some netas to plaintively ask, am I my brother’s keeper? While Modi spoke of chai pe charcha, Akhilesh could only counter with chacha pe charcha. When Modi unleashed his mann ki baat, Rahul Gandhi’s retort was only mummy ki baat. That’s why these elections became a case of pati, patni aur woh.\nHowever Rahul need not lose hope. After all he is also a bachelor like the Yogi and has shown that he is single and still ready to mingle with voters. Of course he’ll have to shed his ma-baap complex and resist the temptation to sing papa kehte hain bada naam karega. Instead to appeal to voters he can always claim that his favourite song is ekla chalo re.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:02:16.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
