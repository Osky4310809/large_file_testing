They are there because they love this country,” he said. \nDismissing the comparison Hayes tried to draw to the large boisterous crowds that greeted Democrats at town hall-style during 2009’s Tea Party movement, Moore said, “No, no, this makes the Tea Party look like preschool. I mean seriously.” \nMoore took Republican statements that certain elements of Obamacare may be retained in their coming healthcare legislation as proof the protests are nullifying November’s resounding GOP election victory. “I’m thinking ‘yeah that’s right,’ we have [won] and we have no power. We don’t control a single branch of government and yet they know the power because we are the majority. That’s the key factor here. We are the majority,” he said. \n“That’s why they know they aren’t going to get away with this,” Moore said of the Republican congressional majority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:11:17.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
