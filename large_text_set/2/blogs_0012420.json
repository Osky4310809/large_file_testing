I thought 'what is happening here?' \n\"They told me there was a visa problem and a red flag had come up against my name because of an Iranian stamp in my passport. I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn't even stay overnight. \n\"The two officials told me if I got on the flight I would simply be deported back to Qatar once I arrived in the States. I tried to explain I didn't even live in Qatar and was just trying to get to my home in the Caribbean.\" \nLast month U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily barring those from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen entering the country. \nOn Thursday, Trump's administration said in court documents that it does not want a larger appeals panel to review a ruling keeping its travel ban on hold and will instead replace the ban. \nSomalia-born British Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah called the travel ban \"deeply troubling\" and has fears over his return to America. \nFarah lives and trains in Portland, Oregon and is currently in Birmingham for the Indoor Grand Prix.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:44:12.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
