Vox’s Todd VanDerWerff writes today that Hollywood should cancel its upcoming Oscars broadcast if it wants to put teeth into its opposition to Donald Trump and his policies: \nPresident Donald Trump’s new immigration order — the one many have labeled a “Muslim ban” because it temporarily bars entry to the US for natives of seven Muslim-majority countries — stops people associated with various Oscar-nominated films from attending the 2017 Academy Awards . That’s just one reason the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should cancel its annual ceremony and instead announce the winners via press release. \nYeah, that’ll show Trump. \nCancel the biggest liberal pat on the back fest ever. \nThe only one hurt by canceling the Oscars would be the out of touch celebrities. \nIn theory, extending the Oscars would hurt Trump more than canceling them would. \nDid you catch the SAG Awards the other day? My lord. I’ve never seen a more embarrassing performance in my life outside of Hillary’s 2016 campaign and Meryl Streep’s meltdown . \nBut hey, go ahead. Cancel them. \nSee what happens. \nAlso, let’s not forget that Trump’s recent immigration order was completely reasonable .
