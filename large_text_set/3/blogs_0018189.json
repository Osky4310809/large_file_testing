An air ambulance is currently attending the scene to remove the casualties. \n\"There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity of the palace of Westminister but I hope colleagues on all sides will appreciate it would be wrong for me to go into further details until we have confirmation from the police and house security authorities about what is going on. \n\"I shall endeavour to do the very best I can, both at the dispatch box and by communicating with my opposite numbers in other political parties to ensure members are kept aware of what is happening, but at the moment the very clear advice from the police and director of security in the house is that we should remain under suspension and that the chamber should remain in lockdown until we receive advice that it is safe to normal procedures.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:31:00.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
