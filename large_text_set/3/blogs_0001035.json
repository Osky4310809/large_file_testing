(PTI) \nAccepting Pakistan’s invitation to solve the Indus Water Treaty, India has announced that it will attend Permanent Indus Commission meeting, reported news agency ANI. The meeting is scheduled to happen in Lahore this month. The Commission is a bilateral commission which consists of officials from both the neighbouring countries. The six rivers covered under the treaty are – eastern rivers of Ravi, Beas, Sutlej, Chenab, Jhelum and Indus along iwth their tributaries. Currently, the dispute is over Kishenganga and Ratla hydroelectric plants of 330 megawatts and 850 megawatts respectively. Pakistan claims that India constructing plants on Kishangag and Chenab violates the Indus Water Treaty shared by the two countries. Pakistan is firm on the Indus Water Treaty and says that it will accept no changes. Islamabad accused India of tricking Pakistan. They said that India bought time to complete the two projects and then said that the projects could not be modified. \nThe issue of water sharing escalated in February when PM Narendra Modi threatened to block the flow of water to Pakistan and leave the country to go dry following growing tensions between the two countries. India-Pakistan relation worsened after the Uri attack and after India’s response in the form of Surgical strikes which destroyed several terrorists’ launchpads and ended up with Indian Army claiming lives of more than a dozen terrorists. \nYou May Also Want To Watch: \nWorld Bank had earlier intervened in the dispute and had asked both the countries to resolve the issue. \nIndus Water Treaty was signed in 1960 and gave India control over three rivers namely, the Ravi, the Beas and the Sutlej while it gave Pakistan control over the Indus, the Chenab and the Jhelum.
