Our tears are right on the surface.” \nOther measures being taken in Denver include a deep review of all executive orders to understand how they affect local governments and an assessment of the needs among refugees and immigrants and what the city can do better, Hancock said. \nHancock also said a room had been reserved at Denver International Airport for immigration attorneys who need to consult with travelers affected by the White House’s order. \nThus far, no one has been detained at DIA, but some have been detained in other cities as they attempted to travel to Denver, Hancock said. \nHancock has doubled-down on his efforts to reassure the immigrant community after earlier attempts disappointed them. \nMonday, Hancock released a video saying he welcomed the title “sanctuary city” if it means Denver welcomes and cares for refugees and immigrants. The video was a follow-up to an earlier news conference where Hancock argued that Denver was not a sanctuary city because there is no legal definition for what that means. \nHancock’s messages came on the heels of a White House order threatening to withhold federal money from cities that don’t cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Denver and Aurora could face sanctions because both cities have policies in conflict with Trump’s demands. \nThe commission’s members added to Hancock’s to-do list. \nTheir suggestions included printing messages in multiple languages and attending more community and neighborhood meetings to tell people firsthand what is being offered and to educate people on the differences between refugees, immigrants, green-card holders and other statuses. \nCommission members also encouraged Hancock to work with mayors in Aurora, Commerce City and Brighton to establish a united front. \n“In general, communities are scared,” said Diana Higuera, executive director of the Aurora Welcome Center. \nFlorian Ezui, a mental health therapist who sits on the commission, said he knows people who already have suffered trauma because of situations they fled in their native countries. Now, those fears are being renewed because of the president’s actions. \nThose people are afraid to leave their houses and want to keep their families inside, which is causing tension with younger generations, Ezui said. \nEzui is originally from Togo, a western African nation that spent decades under military rule as its citizens suffered human rights abuses. \n“With all of my education and everything, I still feel it. I can’t imagine how it is for others,” he said. “Something real is happening to people in our country and we don’t know how we’re going to handle it.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:41:28.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
