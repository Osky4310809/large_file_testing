Muir noted that the author of the report said he found no evidence of voter fraud . Trump accused him of “groveling.” \nMuir: You say you’re going to launch an investigation into (voter fraud). \nTrump: Sure. Done. \nWhat you have presented so far has been debunked. It’s been called false — \nNo it hasn’t. Take a look at the Pew report. \nI called the author of the Pew report last night. He told me they found no evidence of voter fraud. \nReally? Then why did he write the report? \nHe said no evidence of voter fraud. \nExcuse me. Then why did he write the report? Look at the Pew Report. Then he’s groveling again. You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they wanna write something you wanna hear. But not necessarily millions of people want to hear, or have to hear \nIn the interview, Trump mentioned people who are registered to vote in multiple states. Through reporting today , it has come to light that Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon , Trump’s Secretary of the Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin , and Trump’s daughter Tiffany Trump are all registered to vote in two states. \nWatch above, via ABC and CNN. \n[ featured image via screengrab ] \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
