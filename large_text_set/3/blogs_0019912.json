I’ve been living in a cave for a while, and I’m back to let you know that Everything is finally here — you can get it on PS4 today!\nWe had a huge response to our announcement last year and have been hard at work ever since. This game has evolved into something I couldn’t have imagined. There were many things which seemed impossible to pull off in the beginning which we managed to do — and we’re really excited about getting it into your hands.\nAs you may know, the game is centered around being things, and creating an experience where you can not just be things in the world, but you can be the world itself. You’re both the foreground and the background.\nYou discover abilities as you progress through the game, and whatever you can do with one thing you can do with everything. So even though what you are is always changing — and each journey through the game is different — the core experience is structured and designed.\n\nEverything is narrated by recordings of the great British philosopher Alan Watts. He was an incredible mind and had an extraordinary talent for describing the indescribable. I hope when playing this you’ll find that philosophy isn’t something trapped in books, but something you can experience directly, without using anything but your own imagination.\nAside from the core adventure, it’s also a giant sandbox — an interconnected universe which you can explore intuitively as well as design yourself. Just by playing the game you change its level design. Say you travel into a particular galaxy and you keep scaling down until you’re a single atom. You can travel all the way back up to the original galaxy — it all connects to itself.\nAlso, you can transform into anything you’ve already been before. Say you didn’t like trees and wanted to change all the trees into horses; you can do it with the tap of a button. You can change every single object in the universe to horses.\nThis goes even further. You can transform the atoms inside a galaxy into other galaxies, and keep traveling into those, and keep going and going and going.\n\nMaybe you don’t have time to do this. Everything has a default 0-Player mode, so if you let go of the controller, it plays automatically. And it’s controlled by rules which you can set. If you want it to do a certain thing more often, you can tell it to. Everything can play itself automatically for weeks at a time. It will get itself really mixed up, and you can come back to it whenever you want.\nBecause of the huge creative potential of these systems, it’s impossible for us to know what’s going to happen when it’s in your hands, so please share any interesting moments from your experience!\nEverything is a very new kind of game, and it’s something I truly believe games are great at, which is giving us a different way of looking at our own world. Creating this feeling of freedom to move around, explore, talk to things — to really enjoy getting lost. A game where you cannot make a mistake, no matter what you do.\nOur colossal development team of three people worked really hard on this, and we can’t wait to see what you do with it. Everything is out today; we really hope you enjoy it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:06:48.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
