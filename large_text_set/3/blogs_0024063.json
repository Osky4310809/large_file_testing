That's why these sorts of assessments are very important.\" \nThe monitoring also showed the use of synthetic cannabis was on the rise but ecstasy use had fallen, and NSW was Australia's cocaine hotspot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T09:47:48.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
