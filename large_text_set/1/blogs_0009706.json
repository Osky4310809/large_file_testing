If anything, one can imagine every Republican strategist wishing for at least one preposterous rant like the one by the honored actress every week until November of 2020. \nHowever, it is a profound insult for people who rely on the public for their fame and fortune to then turn around and imply that the electoral choice of roughly half of that public represents a giant step towards fascism.
