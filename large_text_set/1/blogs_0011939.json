Lens started the season at Sunderland (Photo: Stu Forster / Getty) Lens scores against Manchester United (Photo: Getty Images) \n“I came in off the training ground (on Friday afternoon) and someone said, “Have you seen this?” If he said that it’s a disgrace to say that about your parent club. \n‘A lot of team-mates here who he played with are fighting every week with a small squad to try and keep us in the Premier League.” \nAsked if there was any way back for Lens Moyes said: “When he left people thought, “What you doing get rid of him?”. \n“I don’t know if anybody would want him back at the club now. If the quotes are correct then I think it would be very hard for that to happen. Moyes is furious with the comments (Photo: Ian MacNicol) \n“We paid £13m for him and I knew his reputation as a player. I thought, “We’re short and we haven’t got a great deal of quality - is it right to move him on?”. \n“But there was just some things I saw which I wasn’t sure about. In the end, these are the decisions the managers have to make. \n“Sometimes you are criticised. I made the decision that I thought he wanted to go and that we could get through without him. \n“I only had a few weeks with him as well, so I was going more on what I’d been told by other people. He didn’t play much last season either. I had to take advice off the likes of Paul Bracewell and Robbie Stockdale, and Sam (Allardyce) as well. \n“I wanted to give him an opportunity but didn’t feel as if I saw enough.” Lens celebrates scoring last term (Photo: Bryn Lennon) \nSunderland are not paying any of Lens' wages as part of his loan to Turkey, and there is no clause to make the deal permanent in the summer. \nLens is reported to have said: “I would like to stay at Fenerbahce for many years. Many things will be easier if Sunderland drop down.” \nSunderland have has a “couple” of offers for left back Patrick Van Aanholt, but Moyes says he won't sell. poll loading Will Jeremain Lens play for Sunderland again? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T17:46:23.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
