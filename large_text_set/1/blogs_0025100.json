In other words, countries selling more goods and service to the U.S. than buying from it. The idea is to rebalance the playing field for U.S. companies by discouraging Americans from importing. \nThe idea appears to overlap with a plan House Republicans are pushing called “border adjustment.” Under this plan, the U.S. would refrain from taxing American companies’ exports, but would tax imports. \nThe new revenues are projected to top $1 trillion over a decade. The money had been envisioned as an offset for lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates, though House Republicans say it could also pay for a wall. \nTrump, however, recently said he didn’t like the “border adjustment” idea. \nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR AMERICANS? \nMexican products would become more expensive. \nThat means pricier tequila, but also things Americans need: cars, eyeglasses and many basic groceries. \nA Toyota Camry? About $1,000 more, according to Jim Lentz, CEO of Toyota North America, noting that a quarter of the car’s parts are imported. \nU.S. exporters are behind the House plan because it would reduce their taxes. \nHere’s the flip side: Importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say the higher prices for Mexican products could hurt sales. And that means American jobs. \nRetailers such as Wal-Mart also could face higher tax burdens. \nWOULD MEXICO REALLY BE PAYING? \nNot quite. \nThe U.S. could recoup some of the wall’s costs by changing the tax and trade policies with Mexico. But the money wouldn’t necessarily be coming from Mexican taxpayers or the Mexican government. \nWhile the tax would land first on companies exporting from Mexico, the costs would likely be passed on to consumers. That leaves Americans footing much of the likely bill. \nTrump has said he’s OK with being “reimbursed” at a later point because he is keen to start building the wall immediately. \nWOULD IT RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THE WALL? \nProbably. \nVarious estimates put the wall’s cost at up to $15 billion. \nHouse Republicans expect their plan to pull in much more than that in its first year. They say that could easily cover the costs of the wall. \nIS IT LEGAL? \nTo be determined. \nThe U.S. has a range of obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement and at the World Trade Organization. And Mexico is likely to challenge any new tax that penalizes its economy. \nTrump has said he plans to renegotiate NAFTA. Mexico, however, is under no obligation to soften the agreement for his sake. \nOther countries may also object, if their products and services are targeted. \nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the border adjustment is essentially a tariff that would be struck down by the WTO if it targets Mexico. \nHOW WOULD THIS AFFECT THE ECONOMY? \nA topic of great dispute. \nThe White House said the plan would increase U.S. wages, help U.S. businesses and consumers, and deliver “huge economic benefits.” With so much of the plan ill-defined, it’s impossible to substantiate those claims. \nAny turbulence in the U.S.-Mexican trade relationship could have implications for the entire world. \nMexico is the second-largest exporter to the United States, after China. The United States imported roughly $271 billion of goods from Mexico during the first 11 months of 2016, according to the Commerce Department, and ran a trade deficit of almost $60 billion. \nDO REPUBLICANS LIKE TRUMP’S PLAN? \nNot all of them. \nRep. Justin Amash of Michigan said on Twitter it would be a “tax on Americans to pay for the wall.” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was “mucho sad” and that “any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila or margaritas is a big-time bad idea.” \nEven Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, dismissed the idea of using tariffs as a trade ploy. \nRepublicans have traditionally hailed themselves as the party of free trade. \nWHAT OTHER WAYS COULD TRUMP GET MEXICO TO PAY? \nDuring the campaign, Trump floated a number of possibilities without committing to any in particular. \nHe proposed changing a rule under the USA Patriot Act to block some of the roughly $25 billion in remittances that Mexicans living in the U.S. send home each year. He said he would refuse to free up the money until Mexico agrees to pay the U.S. between $5 billion and $10 billion. \nOpponents of that plan say Mexicans in the U.S. would likely find other ways to send money back. They could take cash with them when traveling, wire money to a non-Mexican bank or use off-the-books transfers that are difficult to police. \nTrump also suggested increasing visa fees for Mexicans to raise money, or canceling business and tourist visas issued to Mexicans until their country pays for the wall. \n___ \nAP Business Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit and writers Erica Werner and Stephen Ohlemacher in Washington contributed to this report. \n___ \nReach Josh Boak on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshboak \nReach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:37:49.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
