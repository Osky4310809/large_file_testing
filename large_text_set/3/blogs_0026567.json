Mayor Eric Garcetti has said the LAPD would comply only with ICE requests when a warrant was criminal and involved serious crimes. \n“We don’t honor ICE detainer requests without a warrant that’s signed by a judge,” Garcetti reaffirmed Tuesday during an announcement of expanded restrictions on local officers’ involvement with immigration enforcement. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-0'); }); \nThe non-detention by local authorities of arrested individuals who may be illegal immigrants despite requests from ICE is a major controversy, especially as President Trump threatens to withhold funding from sanctuary cities, and amid the argument of many that illegals provide a substantial crime risk. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-0'); }); \nAs reported by The Daily Wire googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-1'); }); \nJessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies found that in a nine-month timeframe in 2014, sanctuary cities shielded 9,265 illegals from deportation, 62 percent of which “had significant prior criminal histories” and 2,320 of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes, according to Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review. \nLos Angeles seems willing to pay a heavy price to maintain its sanctuary status. \nAccording to Reuters , “Local governments in Los Angeles County received $582 million in federal aid in the most recent fiscal year,” which may be forfeit under this administration. \nFurthermore, CBS quoted Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich in 2013 on how illegals affect Los Angeles’ fiscal bottom line. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nAntonovich stated “When you add the $550 million for public safety and nearly $500 million for healthcare, the total cost for illegal immigrants to [LA] county taxpayers exceeds $1.6 billion dollars a year. These costs do not even include the hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually for education.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nOf course, it is difficult to think about illegal immigrants being released by sanctuary cities without being reminded of another California city, San Francisco, which as a sanctuary city released Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an illegal immigrant from Mexico. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nWeeks later, the illegal shot and murdered Kathryn Steinle. \nMs. Steinle, an American citizen, was reportedly discussing her upcoming marriage while walking with her father on San Francisco’s Pier 14. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:08:00.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
