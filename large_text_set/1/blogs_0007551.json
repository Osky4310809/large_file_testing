It is evidence that the typical \" oh but sources and methods\" types won out. \n— Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) January 6, 2017 \nThe president-elect continues to dismiss claims that Russian interference had any impact on the election outcome. \n“While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democratic National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was not tampering whatsoever with voting machines,” Donald Trump said in a statement Friday after a briefing with U.S. intelligence officials. \nIn July, Trump reaffirmed that he had no business deals Russians, except for one instance. \n“What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Florida. Palm Beach is a very expensive place,” the then-GOP nominee said during a news conference. “There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I sold it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago. I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK?” \nHe acknowledged that numerous developers of the Trump Organization “wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
