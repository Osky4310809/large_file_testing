The vehicle later turned out to be registered under the name of the wife of the suspect police officer. \nMarisa Dawis, the couple’s helper, was also abducted. \nInvestigation by the PNP-AIDG showed that two men initially went inside the house and introduced themselves as police officers, conducted a search and eventually destroyed closets in the process. \nPNP Anti-Kidnapping Group Luzon unit chief Senior Supt. Rodolfo Castil Jr., in a letter addressed to Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Theodore Villanueva, recommended the investigation of the suspects for kidnapping for ransom and serious illegal detention. \nThe suspects are one police officer assigned to the PNP-AIDG, another identified male, three unidentified men with detailed descriptions and several “John Does.” The names of the identified suspects were withheld upon request of Choi for fear of further harm of her family. \nP8-million ransom \nOn her own, Choi negotiated with the kidnappers after they texted her, demanding a ransom of P8 million. She delivered the the negotiated amount—P5 million—to the designated location but her husband was not released. \nThree days after, the kidnappers demanded an additional P4.5 million which she could no longer deliver. \nShe had no recourse then but to tell the police of the ransom payment. \nNo word has been heard from the kidnappers since then. \nChoi said it was her hope that her husband remained alive and well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:30:35.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
