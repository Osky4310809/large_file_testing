And because the trailer incorporates shots of Theron’s character romping in bed with a French operative, played by Sofia Boutella , everybody is very excited to ask the star about lesbian sex.\nAdvertisement \n\nTheron, however, addresses the scene candidly. On Sunday, during an appearance at SXSW, she was asked about “seducing” her co-star.\n“Seducing her? It’s very easy, she’s gorgeous!” Theron told ET Canada. “She was just great. She was the only actress that we looked at. She came over, she hung out with me and [director] Dave, and there was something about her that was so genuinely innocent and yet incredibly strong, that she was really perfect for the film.”\nAdvertisement \n\nIn fact, Theron is confident that their chemistry could not be matched.\n“I can’t imagine anyone else doing it,” she says. “She’s a dancer, I’m a dancer. So, we’re a little bit like—you know dancers are like, ‘What? Being naked is nothing.’ We just wanted it to be real and cool.’”\nThe spy thriller arrives in theaters on July 28, and it looks truly badass. Or rather, Theron’s character appears to be a badass who bests men in combat and conversation, and takes pleasure when she wants it. I can’t wait.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:24:27.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
