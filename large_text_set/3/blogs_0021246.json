As part of a week that will feature a number of significant schools hosting their Pro Day events, Toledo was just one of the colleges opening their doors to the league on Monday.\nNot known as a hotbed for NFL level talent, the Rockets have a talent at tight end that appears to have drawn the attention of the Black and Gold. Steelers tight end coach James Daniel reportedly was on hand to watch Michael Roberts go through his paces having met extensively with the young prospect the night before. This news comes from Tony Pauline of Draft Insider. Daniel was just one of many to be keeping a close eye on Roberts as he went through his drills.\nSteelers and Lions working out Anthony Kukwa and Michael Roberts right now pic.twitter.com/ct7jUVc2Lj \n— News-Herald preps (@NHPreps) March 20, 2017 \nRelated: Steelers sign free agent RB/KR Knile Davis \nIn a deep tight end class, Roberts may be a step behind the top names in his group but shows a lot of promise for the future, a sign of just how deep the 2017 crop might be. Standing 6-foot-4 and weighing in around 261-pounds, Roberts is a capable blocker and receiver.\nShowing surprising agility and quickness for a man his size, Roberts may not possess the top-end speed some teams covet but is more athletic that others might assume.\nToledo TE Michael Roberts is another excellent mid round option.

He will need to work on his route running and become more consistent with his run blocking, but could be an interesting selection for the Steelers on day three.\n\nRelated: Steelers sign free agent cornerback Coty Sensabaugh ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:25:47.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
