The Football Whispers Index takes the latest transfer rumours and gives them a score out of five; the higher the score, the more realistic and reliable the whisper. \nHere are today's top five emerging whispers for the summer. And keep an eye on Transfer Talk for all the latest gossip. \nWayne Rooney to Everton \nThe return of Wayne Rooney to boyhood club Everton has just become more likely, after Toffees manager Ronald Koeman claimed such a move would be welcome in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News HQ. The 31-year-old made his debut for the Merseyside club in 2002 at the age of 16, signing for Manchester United two years later, but the England skipper has been a peripheral figure in Jose Mourinho's squad this season and a summer move away from Old Trafford is expected. Rooney has previously stated that he would never play for a Premier League club other than United or Everton, so if he wants to stay in England then we know where he is going. \nCharlie Taylor to Liverpool \nLeeds United defender Charlie Taylor could provide a solution to Liverpool's left-back issues according to the Yorkshire Post, with the 23-year-old's contract expiring at the end of the season. James Milner has been appearing regularly in the position for the Reds this season, with Jurgen Klopp unable to trust Alberto Moreno to deliver consistently. The Yorkshire club have rejected offers from West Brom and West Ham in the past, but Taylor will be free to join a new club in the summer. \nLeonardo Bonucci to Chelsea \nPremier League champions-elect Chelsea continue to be heavily linked with a move for Juventus' 29-year-old defender Leonardo Bonucci, and are preparing a £40m bid, according to the Independent. The Italy international won Serie A's Footballer of the Year award last season, but a high profile bust-up with manager Massimiliano Allegri has made the chances of an exit at the end of the season likely. \nNaby Keita to Liverpool \nJurgen Klopp is plotting a summer swoop for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old midfielder Naby Keita, the Metro is reporting. Keita has scored four times for the Red Bull-owned club that have taken the Bundesliga by storm this season, and the Guinea international has been one of the side's star performers. However Liverpool will face competition for his signature, with Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich all apparently interested in the player. \nGiorgio Chiellini to Real Madrid \nItalian champions Juventus could lose a second member of their defensive unit this summer, with Giorgio Chiellini emerging as a target for Spanish giants Real Madrid, according to reports in Spain. The 32-year-old's contract expires at the end of next season, and Real are planning to bid over £50m for the ageing centre-back. Chelsea and Arsenal are also reported to be interested in the Italy international.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T11:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T15:37:10.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
