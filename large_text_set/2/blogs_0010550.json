Let's start with the one Trump will like -- and not dismiss out-of-hand as \" fake news .\" A fresh Morning Consult/ Politico survey measures majority or plurality support for every Trump executive order they polled. The three that garner a majority are withholding federal funding from sanctuary cities (55/33), temporarily banning travel for most people seeking to enter America from seven majority-Muslim nations (55/38), and suspending new federal regulations (54/33).

One big exception: The economy, on which Trump is right-side-up by three points. A majority of men approve of the president's job performance; a larger majority of women disapprove. Issue by issue, it's striking how different the results are from the Quinnipiac and Politico surveys, with the former being much less favorable to Trump and Republicans overall. The Q-poll nevertheless finds strong approval (+20) for Trump's selection of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, with a very large majority (+40) of respondents saying that Democrats should permit a vote on the nomination (even as most give a thumbs-down to Republicans' use of the Biden/Schumer Rule against Merrick Garland.
