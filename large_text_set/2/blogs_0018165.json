Boudreau , who took over as the City College interim president after Ms. Coico resigned. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The federal inquiry, together with a related state investigation into broader university practices, comes at an inopportune time for CUNY, the country’s largest public urban university and a longtime engine of upward mobility. City College, its flagship, has been known as “the poor man’s Harvard.” For years, states have been slashing spending on public higher education while tuition has been climbing, and at CUNY, the lack of funding has contributed to deteriorating facilities and overcrowded classrooms. But the frustrations at CUNY have been compounded by the perception that top administrators have been enriching themselves at the expense of a predominantly poor and minority student body, more than half of whom report family incomes of less than $30,000. The future of CUNY, which receives the bulk of its funding from the state, has also drawn increasing attention from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, as well as state and city lawmakers. After Dr. Coico’s resignation, William C. Thompson Jr., the chairman of CUNY’s Board of Trustees and a former New York City comptroller, asked for a thorough investigation of “all of the college foundations, alumni associations or other affiliated entities.” Weeks later, Catherine Leahy Scott, the New York State inspector general, criticized the university’s financial practices as “ripe for abuse” in an unusual interim report , prompting Mr. Cuomo to call for sweeping reforms and precipitating a shake-up at CUNY’s central office. At City College, Dr. Coico’s annual compensation was $460,000; $160,000 of that came from the 21st Century Foundation. She also received a $90,000 housing allowance. But people who have been briefed on the investigation and spoke only on the condition of anonymity said that prosecutors appear to be focusing on whether she received thousands of dollars on top of that from the City College Fund, possibly over several years, without the knowledge of either the current CUNY chancellor, James B. Milliken, or his predecessor, Matthew Goldstein. According to Dr. Boudreau, the latest subpoena is seeking documents like annual financial statements, annual filings with the Internal Revenue Service and all payments that may have been made to Dr. Coico or any related entities in which she or her family had a financial stake. Dr. Boudreau said he welcomed “efforts to fully examine the way these foundations have worked” because “I think there’s a tremendous need for transparency.” Photo Lisa S.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Capers, the United States attorney, declined to comment. A lawyer for Dr. Coico, Catherine M. Foti , also declined to comment.
