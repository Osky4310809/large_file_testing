(Peter Schmuck) \nTigers' touching pregame ceremony \nThe Detroit Tigers officially re-opened their upgraded spring training ballpark with a 20-minute pregame ceremony honoring late owner Mike Ilitch, who passed away on Feb. 10 at age 87. \nThe tribute included a video presentation on the huge new video scoreboard and the team unveiled the uniform patch the Tigers will wear throughout the 2017 season. The round patch bears Ilitch’s nickname -- Mr. I – against a simple white background with a dark blue border. The same image was painted on the grass in front of the Tigers dugout. \nPitchers and catchers reported for duty on Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. The Orioles begin the 2017 season at home against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 3. \nIlitch, who founded the Little Caesar’s Pizza chain, had owned the team since 1992, when he bought it from Domino's Pizza chain owner Tom Monaghan. Ilitch also owned the NHL ’s Detroit Red Wings . \nJohnny G’s big debut \nGiavotella got the start at second base and made quite an account of himself in front of his new team. He singled in each of his three at-bats. It would take an unexpected sequence of events to land him on the Opening Day roster, but stranger things have happened. The impression he makes on manager Buck Showalter could determine whether he’s the first guy on the Norfolk shuttle if the Orioles need a fill-in player. \nHardy update \nShortstop J.J. Hardy, who received an anti-inflammatory injection in his lower back Thursday, said he still is on schedule to get back in action in early March. \n“I’m feeling much better,\" he said. “I think [the injection] was more just to get over the hump, so I think that’s what it did.” \nHardy continues to work on his core strength while waiting to return to baseball activities. The club has projected that he might be available to play in an exhibition game by March 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:19:35.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
