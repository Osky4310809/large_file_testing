The club does not believe the station redevelopment will affect the stadium's opening date, however. \nSpurs will continue to monitor the construction schedule and timescale for the new stadium and will only activate the Wembley clause when they are sure it will be ready in time, while a club source told ESPN FC they are also waiting for the FA to confirm certain arrangements. \nThe uncertainty about the move helps to explain the curious lack of fanfare around the last season at White Hart Lane -- in stark contrast to West Ham's lengthy farewell to the Boleyn Ground. Spurs, however, do not believe they are leaving their home, merely redeveloping it, and will therefore confine celebrations to the final home match against Manchester United on May 13. \nKat Law, co-chair of The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust, told ESPN FC: \"Like the manager, the players, and senior club staff, fans have been working on the basis that this is the last season at White Hart Lane. \n\"That's why we understand there's been a change in the home ticketing system, and that's why fans are spending time and money travelling from across the world to experience this stadium for the last time this season. The club has a duty to its fans to communicate any possibilities and we'd hope they would do this clearly and quickly.\" \nSpurs will have to spend at least one season away from White Hart Lane and if they are forced to stay at their current home for another season, they could play at Wembley for the 2018-19 campaign before moving into the new stadium a year later than planned. \nMeanwhile, Spurs have agreed a deal with Nike to become their new kit-supplier for next season. \nDan is ESPN FC's Tottenham correspondent.
