Shortly after director James Gunn revealed that it was the former-Andy Dwyer who suggested Kurt Russell should play Ego the Living Planet in the “biggest visual effect of all time,” Pratt shared the IMAX poster for GotG Vol. 2 , along with a message that, when you remember how good that Fleetwood Mac trailer is , might not be as hyperbolic as it sounds.\n“On May 5th the greatest movie in the history of movies is coming,” the Jurassic World star wrote. He’s probably referring to Three Generations , right? “There has never been and will never again be a movie like this.” This could still be about Three Generations . “Seriously.” Seriously. “Ever heard of Citizen Kane ? We’re much better. Seriously. Our movie just tested at over one million points. Rotten tomatoes already has it at 234% fresh.” Hm, I guess it’s not about Three Generations , which is only 156% “fresh.” Pratt continued:\n\n#GotGVol2 will win every movie award AND about 39 Olympic gold medals in swimming, gymnastics, the skiiing event with the gun, x games, snowmobiling and everything. It will win the World Cup and about 7 super bowl rings, sorry TOM Brady. This movie will fry your brains and lift your spirits. James Gunn will be elected president of the world. They will add the faces of the guardians to Mount Rushmore for sure. We’re gonna get a planet. May 5th will become a national holiday. Everyone will get pregnant. Candy will fall from the sky. Global warming will stop. Dinosaurs will come back to life. Which unlike some movies might tell you, is actually a really good thing. Because they won’t flip out and kill people instead they’ll be your awesome pets. So basically get your tickets as soon as you can. Don’t be the only person on the planet who doesn’t see this movie.\nHumbly,\nStarlord\nReplace every reference to Guardians with “Donald Trump,” as in, “Donald Trump will win every movie award” and “they will add the face of Donald Trump to Mount Rushmore,” and you have the president’s next speech. \nHere’s the spiffy IMAX poster.\nMARVEL\n(Via Facebook )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:48:59.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
