The huge turnout — estimated to be at least half a million — overwhelmed the available portable toilets. The marchers looked to nearby shops searching for relief, often finding no luck. By 3 p.m., the crowd, by now moving, had gotten punchy. Chants kept erupting. “We want a leader, not a creepy tweeter,” people chanted from one part of the crowd, as it inched across the mall toward the White House. Just off 15th Street, a block north of the parade’s official end point, a large flatbed float, with big “TRUMP” letters arched along the back, parked itself in the middle of the street, drawing the ire of thousands of marchers, who berated the float with chants of “Shame!” and “We are the popular vote!” Police officers formed a barricade around the float with more than a half-dozen sidecar motorcycles. Some marchers kept moving toward the White House but others started to make their way to Metro stations, rushing back to their buses, trains and lives. As the sun set in downtown Washington Saturday night, signs littered the sidewalk and stuck out of trash and recycling bins like broken umbrellas. Fontella Garraway, a 50-year-old retired Army veteran who drove three and half hours from Rocky Mount, N.C., sat on a bench staring at the White House. She wore a pin that read “girl power.” “Even looking at the White House, it’s like I hope he’s looking out here at us,” she said of Mr. Trump. Moments later she placed a handwritten sign that read “Love trumps hate; Hear our voice,” on the fence facing the White House. “That’s his inauguration gift,” she said. \nYamiche Alcindor, Nick Corasaniti and Katie Rogers contributed reporting.
