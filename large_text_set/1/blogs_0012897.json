Britons spend only a tiny portion of their food budget on organics, and the marketing push aims to bring them into line with the Danes, who are the world’s biggest consumers of organic food and drink. \nPaul Moore , chief executive of industry campaign group the Organic Trade Board, said the money would help the movement become a major player in the UK’s £197bn grocery market. “We need to increase availability of organic products, and that means convincing retailers that organic should be a key part of their sales strategy,” he said. “That’s where our partnership with Denmark will be crucial as we share the insights and strategy they have pursued to get more organic on shelf in the UK.” \nWith some organic products costing up to 30% more in the UK, the market has in the past been dismissed as a luxury that can only be afforded by affluent foodies. In Denmark, eating organic food is considered folkeligt , says Paul Holmbeck, head of Organic Denmark . The word is used to describe something people feel proud of and a part of, he says. “Half the population buys organic products every week and 80% at least every month. We estimate organic is 10% of all food sales in 2016, taking organic from niche to mainstream.” \nThe extent to which Danes have embraced organics is captured by Økodag, or Organic Day, in the spring when almost a quarter of a million people don wellies to witness the so-called “dancing cows” as the animals rush back into fields to graze after the long winter. In Denmark organic is for everybody, so it is affordable. In the UK it is more elite and the price premium is bigger Claus Juel-Jensen, Danish supermarket boss \nDuring the financial crisis, the organic industry suffered a big setback after major retailers slashed their ranges to focus on cutting prices. Although UK sales grew sharply last year, increasing 5.6% to £1.4bn, the average Briton spends £24 a year on organic foods, compared with £141 in Denmark, with the market amounting to less than 2% of UK grocery sales. \nDenmark’s organic industry has benefited from the long-running support of major retailers, including Netto, the discount supermarket chain owned by Dansk Supermarked, the Danish equivalent of Tesco. “The reason organic is so big in Denmark is a number of big retailers invested heavily in the 1990s and 2000s,” says Netto chief executive Claus Juel-Jensen. “We made it affordable by making a lower [profit] margin on organic products for a number of years. We also did a good job of explaining the issues around the environment and creating awareness.” \nThe success of Netto’s organic ranges spurred on rivals to enter the fray and in turn expand the market. That scale has helped to reduce the price of organic food in Denmark, although it still costs 10-20% more. The cause has also been given a leg-up by Danish government policy, which includes the target that 60% of food served in public-sector kitchens, be it in schools, nursing homes or prisons, is organic. “In Denmark organic is not for the elite but for everybody, so it is priced so everybody can afford it,” says Juel-Jensen. “In the UK it is a little bit more elite and high end and the price premium is bigger. Even during the financial crisis our organic sales kept growing because consumers identified with the organic message.” \nThe new EU money, which is shared with Denmark, which is substantially more than it has received in previous funding rounds, will be used to fund national advertising campaigns and retailer promotions. The £9m includes a £340,000 contribution from 60 Organic Trade Board members, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Rachel’s. The three-year funding is guaranteed despite last summer’s vote for Brexit. \nMalcolm Walker, founder of the frozen food giant Iceland and organic chain As Nature Intended, says the organic market is a tough one to crack. Iceland had a go in 2001 but says its customers “weren’t ready at the time”. “People say ‘I’d pay more for this or that’ but when it comes to the purchasing decision they don’t,” he says, adding that As Nature Intended, run by his daughter Caroline Gooding, succeeds only in “cafe society type places”. \n“Organic is a mindset. It’s someone who reads the Observer , drinks red wine and grinds their own coffee. They’ve got to be reasonably affluent, but it’s not about being rich … it’s more about mindset and beliefs.” \nBut if the UK organic industry is going to enjoy anything like Denmark’s success, there will have to be a step change in organic farming. Currently only 548,000 hectares are organic, accounting for less than 2% of total agricultural production. Moore says there is an export opportunity as the US, which is the biggest organic market with annual sales of more than £35bn, is a net importer. “I would say to the farming community: take a look at where the growth is and what you are doing and consider going into organic,” says Moore. “It’s the market of the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:18:45.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
