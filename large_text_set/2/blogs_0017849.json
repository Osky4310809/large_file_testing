If you want to try your hand at fermenting, but are a bit intimidated by the process, just relax; this recipe only has three ingredients. Advertisement \nNow, before we go any further, let’s talk about safety. With any kind of garlic infusion, there is some concern about botulism, but fermentation enthusiast Brad Leone has an easy fix for that. As Brad explains in the video above, botulism can’t survive in an environment with a pH lower than 4.6 . Brad simply tests his mixture with a little pH meter , then adds apple cider vinegar if needed. \nToo make this sweet and pungent syrup, simply crush and cut up some garlic, slicing off any “little boo boo spots,” and tossing it into a jar. (Make sure to leave some head space to allow for all sorts of bubbly action.) Cover it some really good, raw honey, give it a stir, and set it on a counter. Go back to it once a day to open it up and release the gases but, according to Brad, this stuff will stay good at room temperature for up to a year. (Just make sure to check that pH and add apple cider vinegar to keep it under 4.6.) Advertisement \nThe garlic will release its juices, lose some of its bite, and get all soft and chewy. You can drizzle the resulting syrup on almost any meat, rice dish, or salad, or you can get real hippy-dippy and take it as a preventative tonic (which Brad swears by).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:48:08.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
