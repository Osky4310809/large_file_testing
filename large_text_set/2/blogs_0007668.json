SHARE Disney This Week: Pirates of the Caribbean, Ant-Man & more! \nWelcome to another edition of our regular weekly feature Disney This Week here at ComingSoon.net, rounding up the latest news on all things Disney, including movies, TV, Blu-ray/DVD, Marvel Studios, theme parks, fan art and Disney history. Let us know what you like or want to see more out of in Disney This Week in the comments below! \nFirst Look at Will Turner in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales \nThe Super Bowl spot for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales had a lot of new footage from the upcoming fifth film and also offered our first look at the return of Orlando Bloom’s WIll Turner to the franchise. \nAs you may recall, following the end of 2007’s Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End , Will became the new captain of The Flying Dutchman and was cursed to sail the seas and ferry the dead to the other side. As part of his curse, he is only allowed to return to land for one day every ten years. It is worth noting, however, that when he became the Captain and broke Davy Jones’ curse, the crew reverted back to a human form, but if we take the image below at face value, it would appear Will is slowly being cursed again… \nMichael Douglas Confirms He’ll be Back for Ant-Man and the Wasp \nThough it was largely a given, actor Michael Douglas has confirmed via Facebook that he will reprise his role as Dr. Hank Pym for the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp . The actor also revealed that production on the sequel is set to begin in July. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Interviews and Behind-the-Scenes Photos \nComingSoon.net and SuperHeroHype got a chance to visit the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 set in Atlanta, Georgia in April of 2016 and we now have eight interviews to share with you. Check out the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 interviews via the link above! \nMary Poppins Returns Begins Production! \nProduction on Mary Poppins Returns , the all new sequel to Disney’s 1964 film Mary Poppins , has commenced at England’s Shepperton Studios. The film, which stars Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt and Emmy, Grammy and Tony Award winner Lin-Manuel Miranda and is directed and produced by Academy Award nominee, Emmy and DGA Award winner Rob Marshall ( Into the Woods , Chicago ), is scheduled for release December 25, 2018. \nThe film also stars Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer and Julie Walters with Colin Firth and Meryl Streep. In addition, Dick Van Dyke plays Mr. Dawes Jr., the chairman of Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, which is now run by William Weatherall Wilkins (Firth). What’s on your shelf?

Happy anniversary to Disney California Adventure! pic.twitter.com/c2ThK6SN2R \n— Disney (@Disney) February 8, 2017 Disney Vault \nEach week we highlight an underappreciated Disney classic! Since this installment is very Pirates of the Caribbean -centric, we thought we’d remember another great live-action Disney movie about a swarthy pirate, the comedy Blackbeard’s Ghost , released on February 8, 1968 and celebrating its 49th anniversary this week! Arguably Disney’s best early live-action helmer Robert Stevenson ( Mary Poppins , The Absent-Minded Professor , The Love Bug ) directed this story of a New England track coach (Dean Jones) who summons the dread pirate Blackbeard (Peter Ustinov), whose ghost is cursed to wander the Earth until he does a good deed. Hijinks ensue as the pair form a pact to help the track team win. This is the kind of delightful 60’s era kids flick the company churned out in great numbers, and is well worth a watch for the fun wire effects and a great performance by Ustinov!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:51:36.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
