And Buffy was a way to tell the audience you’re not alone,\" added Boreanaz.

I feel isolated.’ Those sort of core human emotions,\" said Caulfield. \nThe cast took part in a reunion photo shoot and you can see the result in the gallery below (via EW ). \n“This is surreal,” says Whedon. “For the most part, this is like a high school reunion but much worse because they all still look really great. I was hoping some of them would puff out a bit. But that did not take place.” \nReflecting on her time playing Willow Rosenberg, Hannigan says, \"“It was the role of a lifetime,\" which is particularly true in her case since she married co-star Alexis Denisof. “I met the love of my life. And just to get to go to work every day and have Joss sort of train me — I’ll never have a better experience than that.” \n“I’m so incredibly proud of what we all created,\" Gellar says. Sometimes you need distance to really understand the gravitas of that. I appreciate everything about that job. As an actor, all you ever want to do is leave your mark — you want to do something that affects people.” \n“The most important thing to me is that I have had people come up to me and say the show made me feel different about what they could be, about what they could do, about how they respond to problems, about being a female leader,” says Whedon. “People getting strength from my own little terrors is… There is no better legacy than that.” \nMore Buffy The Vampire Slayer :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:13:43.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
