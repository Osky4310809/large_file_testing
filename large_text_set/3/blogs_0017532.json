My Dad was the most kind hearted, loving, hard working, determined, and funny man I have ever known. He was like a super hero, he had the ability to get the best out of you day in and day out. I'm gonna miss your hugs. I'm gonna miss your advice. I'm gonna miss your smile, and I'm gonna miss your laugh. I know you're looking down at us right now giving us the green light to move forward. I miss you Daddy. I'll love you forever - Your youngest.\"\nThe actor's father was only 52 when he passed suddenly a week ago of yet-to-be known causes.\nRico's older sister Raini Rodriguez also posted a tribute to her dad (below): \nYou have officially been gone one week daddy and while it has been really difficult, we are all still standing tall and I know it's because you are sending us strength and guidance all the way from heaven. My daddy was the greatest man in my life. His work ethic and sense of humor were two of his greatest characteristics, both of which he shared with me. He has taught me so many life lessons and inspired me constantly to follow my dreams. I know you will continue to shine down on me, momma, Rico, Ray, Poppi and baby and we will be ok! I promise to make you proud daddy. I will love and miss you forever. - Your one and only baby girl A post shared by Raini Rodriguez (@rainydaychatter) on Mar 19, 2017 at 9:48am PDT \nWe hope they can allow the great memories they have of their father to give them comfort during this difficult time.\nThey're in our thoughts!\n[ Image via Instagram . ] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:33:35.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
