Just when you thought reality TV was safe. There's going to be a Trump-related dating show.\nThe idea is from David Goss, the man who created TrumpSingles.com. The site, which launched last year and caters to GOP lovers, is a relative newcomer on the dating scene but has racked up some 37,500 users since the election.\nGoss has partnered with Mark Walker of Boxx Communications to produce a TV series based on the site. The concept is still being finalized, but it will likely be a bit different from the site. It will be a competition, revolving around politics, naturally, but it won't be limited to people from TrumpSingles.com\nSEE ALSO: This man wants to make dating great again for Trump supporters\nIn fact, Goss told The Hollywood Reporter , \"We would love to create a show that can show different people's positions and possibly bring them together.\"\nThat may be difficult. Single people seem pretty eager to find people who share their political views. TrumpSingles obviously caters to fans of POTUS, but even mainstream dating services like OKCupid are finding their users are eager to find like-minded people.\nThe show is still just in the development phase — it doesn't have a network or even a name yet — so there's no telling if it will ever actually pierce your eyeballs. But since the President is a former reality star himself, it would be only fitting that his fans found love the same way.\nBONUS: This parkour robot overlord has 'Terminator' written all over it", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/88Sc4ukz.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/88Sc4ukz.jpg", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/trumpsinglescom-reality-tv-series-works-982124"], "published": "2017-03-03T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:14:07.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
