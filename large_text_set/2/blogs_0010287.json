I started crying. I didn’t know what to do,” Gabrielle said.\nWoman says the dog she nicknamed \"Buster\" was tossed from an SUV in Boca Raton (WPEC-CBS 12) Though shaken, she did do something. After taking the dog she nicknamed “Buster” home for the night, Gabrielle brought him to the Tri-County Animal Rescue organization on Sunday.\n“I can’t imagine who in their right mind or who would even ever think of such a horrific act. To take a dog and throw the dog out of a car,” said Suzi Goldsmith, the group’s executive director.\nShe said when the dog was thrown out, he didn’t land on all four legs and could have broken his pelvis, but a trip to the vet Monday showed no injuries for Buster, who Goldsmith says is doing great.\n“This dog is perfect, well behaved, sweet, likes to put his head on your shoulder. He doesn’t have a bad quality. That’s what’s so bizarre about this,” Goldsmith said.\nShe thought Buster might have had an issue with his two rear legs but the veterinarian performed X-rays and other tests on the dog and only found scrapes.\nThe main problem Buster is facing is his weight. The veterinarian said the 1-year-old Dalmatian weighs 42 pounds, which is about 23 pounds underweight.\n“He was so pathetically thin. As soon as he came in, we had every kind of food out,” Goldsmith said. “You name it, we had it out. It looked like a smorgasbord.”\nAfter devouring four hot dogs and being given other foods and water, Goldsmith is hoping Buster will get back to a healthy weight.\nShe also hopes the news coverage about the dog will turn up the person who got rid of the dog in such a dangerous manner so they can be prosecuted.\nBuster will remain at the shelter for at least the next five days and perhaps longer if an investigation determines he’s needed for evidence. After that, Buster could be put up for adoption.\nThe shelter is closed Mondays and Thursdays but anyone with questions about adopting Buster or other dogs and cats at the facility can call 561-482-8110.\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "https://api.nlr.tronc.com/v3/newsletters/subscriptions&newsletterApiKey=t2RIwsHk5p8RFZ0sPKLEr2M0Rh64DNz69BDRyGQa&grecaptchaSiteKey=6Le1uQoUAAAAAJlmu5Oue58PyhPzc_ZLYtR7AzKt&aid=2089072590&allurl=http://membership.orlandosentinel.com/newsletters", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a20d95/turbine/fl-pn-dog-thrown-suv-20170213", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a1a222/turbine/fl-dlphillips-1486987880-snap-photo"], "published": "2017-02-13T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:26:32.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
