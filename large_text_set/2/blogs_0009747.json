And a 29-year-old man was killed during a similar robbery last month in South Dallas. \nSo far this year, there have been 42 robberies linked to social media purchases. In 2016, there were 152 such robberies, Dallas police officials told the City Council's public safety committee on Monday. \nCouncil members supported the idea. Grand Prairie, Arlington and Fort Worth are among cities already doing something similar. \n\"The safer, the better,\" said council member Adam Medrano. \nPolice have also been battling an uptick in aggravated assaults, many of which are connected to gangs. Drive-by shootings and road rage incidents have increased, and of the 18 homicides this year, eight appear to be gang-related, officials said. \nThe police department, meanwhile, is continuing to shrink, down to 3,219 officers compared with 3,466 this time last year. In Dallas, 99 cops have quit in 10 weeks, putting the police hiring spree on life support \nInterim Dallas Police Chief David Pughes said he expects to lose about 350 officers this fiscal year, which started in October and ends September. He pointed to the failing police and fire pension system as one of the reasons cops are quitting. \nThe chief said the department was struggling to respond quickly to 911 calls in January before changing the patrol shifts. The seven patrol divisions are down 82 officers compared with last year. \nTo combat rising crime with a shrinking force, Pughes said the department will focus on training officers to recognize gang crime, arrest repeat violent offenders with outstanding warrants and create safe zones for people to buy and sell their goods. \nPeople can meet at designated spaces in the parking lots of the seven police substations throughout the city if police move ahead with the plan. Some of the companies facilitating peer-to-peer sales have offered to pay for security cameras, and police officials are considering placing panic buttons in the parking spaces, Pughes said. \n\"I believe this will become popular,\" he said. \nOfficials did not give a timeline for when the \"exchange zones\" would be put in place. \nThe effort would be paired with an education campaign. Police would give safety tips and explain that people should avoid buying goods \"where it's too good a deal to be true,\" Pughes said. No new solutions to spike in crime as Dallas waits for a police chief \nThe zones are just one aspect of the department's overall approach to slowing a rising crime rate. In addition to the robberies, police have also been battling an uptick in aggravated assaults, many of which are connected to gangs. \nPughes said law enforcement will be arresting people on outstanding warrants. In the southern sector, there are 231 violent offenders with warrants out for their arrests. \nPolice want to arrest \"these guys who are just continuing to commit offense after offense,\" Pughes said. Dallas cops beg witnesses to overcome fear of snitching and help solve murders \nAnd to battle the increases in gang crimes, patrol officers will be sent to 30-day rotations with the gang unit. \n\"They get gang training and understanding of what's going on with the most recent types of gang activity and violence in the city and take it back and share that information with their division,\" Pughes said.
