(Photo: Chuck Zlotnick) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBrie Larson didn't just portray Vietnam-era war photographer Mason Weaver in Kong: Skull Island ( in theaters nationwide Friday ). She also shot the part. \nThe Oscar-winning actress, 27, packed the Canon AE-1 film camera she's had since high school and in between scenes chronicled her six-month Kong journey to Australia, Vietnam and Hawaii. On camera for Kong, Larson wielded Weaver's Leica. \n\"I started taking pictures to get into Weaver's mindset, but also because I was in such beautiful locations with such incredible, emotive actors,\" says Larson. \"It was a great opportunity to capture these moments.\" \nMonths later, Larson developed the film and re-lived Kong . \n\"They really captured the experience,\" says Larson. \"And I'm just amazed that they all turned out.\" \nHere are excerpts from Larson's photo journey. \nHigh cheekbones in the bone graveyard \nTom Hiddleston as photographed by Brie Larson. (Photo: Brie Larson) \nLarson shot this picture of Tom Hiddleston , who plays tracker James Conrad, on a set filled with the island skeletal remains of Kong's family. \n\"I had never been on a set like that â€” it was like Disneyland with these giant bones everywhere and atmospheric smoke,\" says Larson. \"I probably burned through 10 rolls of film; I just loved how everything looked. You see the perfect shot and you have got to get it.\" \nJohn C. Reilly in the rain \nJohn C. Reilly poses goofily with an umbrella while shooting 'Kong: Skull Island.' (Photo: Brie Larson) \nJohn C. Reilly plays a World War II survivor who has been stranded for 28 years on mysterious Skull Island. But Reilly managed to get his hands on a modern umbrella during a rain-soaked moment between shots. \n\"We experienced all types of weather,\" says Larson. \"We went from 120 degrees to freezing cold hail and there were times when we would get rained off our set.\" \nWaiting for new direction \nTom Hiddleston at ease in between scenes of 'Kong: Skull Island' with John Goodman (left in hat) in the background. (Photo: Brie Larson) \n\"Most of what I was trying to do was get the moments between filming,\" says Larson. \"These sort of relaxed moments when people are figuring out what to do next.\" \nEven between scenes, Hiddleston (center, with co-star John Goodman in hat) kept his tracker face on. \"He's good at that, that's his vibe,\" says Larson. \nCapturing her first flight \nThe cast took Huey rides in Hawaii for key scenes in 'Kong: Skull Island.' (Photo: Brie Larson) \nDuring one of the first days, Larson and the cast boarded Huey helicopters for a dramatic sunset shoot off the coast of Oahu. \n\"I had never been in a helicopter before. I was strapped in a way that I could just hang out,\" says Larson, who captured one of the other Hueys in the pack. \"It definitely made me nervous at first, but I saw it was holding my weight. And you have to get the shot.\" \nTom Hiddleston gets high off flying \nTom Hiddleston leans into his Huey ride in 'Kong: Skull Island.' (Photo: Brie Larson) \nLarson captured her Huey mate Hiddleston , who was exuberant. \"There was a playfulness in his eyes and the wind was blowing his hair around. It was just a wonderful moment,\" says Larson. CLOSE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T15:46:58.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
