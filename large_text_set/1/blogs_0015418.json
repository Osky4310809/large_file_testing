We’ve seen a lot of variations on ‘ girl uses quotes from a fav TV show to troll bros on dating apps ‘ and frankly, given the dismal level of quality of conversation on dating apps on average, it never gets old.\nBut this was one of the more successful attempts we’ve seen, and it’s extra hilarious because the guy totally buys into it. He doesn’t question her life as a beet farmer at ALL and we don’t know if we’re worried about him or respect how much he respected her imaginary career choice.\nyesterday i convinced a boy that i am a beet farmer by using quotes from the office pic.twitter.com/3xzSEJGVfz \n— caroline (@caro_bearo) January 15, 2017 We especially love when the dude in question tries to, like, relate to this beet farmer girl by talking about his isolated cabin. So smooth, so chill, so unconcerned that the woman he’s talking to is bizarrely obsessed with beets and really wants to tell him about it. He should be commended.\n@caro_bearo that boy one-upped you with that 75 acres tho pic.twitter.com/jlSpIFTfD9 \n— []V[]iggy 🦌🦎 (@mountatlas) January 17, 2017 Both parts of the conversation ended amicably, however. Caroline told Buzzfeed that she eventually fessed up to Nate, and that he thought it was hilarious.\n“A few people have said that it was mean of me to continue with the conversation when he was trying to be nice and make conversation, but it was all in good fun and no one’s feelings were hurt.” We never know what we’re going to get when we dip our toes into the online dating pool, so it’s nice to see a happy ending, even if it’s not the one we expect.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:45:14.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
