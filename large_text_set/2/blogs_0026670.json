Who would have thought Robert Redford was the one with all the answers, though?\nIn Netflix’s upcoming thriller The Discovery , Redford plays Dr. Thomas Harbor, a man who has gained specific knowledge of the afterlife. Death has ultimately lost its meaning, as millions of people have in turn chosen to “reset” their existence by committing suicide.\nUpon arriving at his father’s compound, Dr. Harbor’s son (played by Jason Segel), as well as his friend Isla (Rooney Mara), begin to discover the strange followers who assist Thomas with his experiments. While falling in love, it becomes a struggle to come to terms with their own tragic pasts and the true nature of the afterlife.\nThe Discovery premieres in select theaters on March 31, the same day it makes its way to Netflix.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:46:55.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
