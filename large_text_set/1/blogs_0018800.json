A tube laid in a pond and tarped up in blue becomes the see-through tunnel, complete with goldfish. Cameras attached to the top and sides capture the first-person POV. \nBananenbuurman’s done just about every stunt with a Lego train that you can imagine, including running that bad boy in a vertical loop , ramming it through a Minions cake for some reason, and smashing it into glass . \nThe locomotive eventually stalls, and as the tunnel springs a leak, floodwaters drown the train. But don’t dwell on that part. Just watch it wind its way through a miniature landscape, and try not to think about how it’s all destroyed in the end. \nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .
