[src] The blade with the pistol and poison upgrades \nIn his studies of the Apple of Eden, Altaïr envisioned several upgrades for the Hidden Blade, which he wrote into his Codex, [3] and some of which he used himself. [2] Centuries later, Ezio would acquire these Codex pages over his travels, and Leonardo da Vinci would build the improvements detailed within when Ezio presented him with a page. [3] \nThe first of these improvements was the addition of a secondary Hidden Blade, which was attached to the user's other arm, allowing an Assassin to kill two guards at once, either on the ground or from the air. The second was a metal plate on top of the primary blade's bracer. This allowed one to safely deflect enemy attacks with the blades and also made the blade more durable in combat. [3] \nOther Codex upgrades included the Poison Blade and Hidden Gun . The Poison Blade allowed Ezio to stab an enemy with a lethal dose of poison and leave them to die slowly, granting both a low-profile assassination, as well as a distraction to kill or bypass other enemies, while the Hidden Gun allowed an Assassin to make a loud but assured kill from a distance. Additionally, both blades could be supplemented with various vambraces, which acted as protective armor . [2] [3] [18] Da Vinci \"I ask if he can arm a crossbow bolt beneath my wrist. He ponders for a moment and declares it possible, but expensive.\" ―Francesco Vecellio asking Leonardo to create the Hidden Bolt. [src] \nUpon his arrival in Rome, Leonardo envisioned further improvements to the Hidden Blade, such as a poison dart launcher, which allowed the use of the Poison Blade from a distance. [18] \nLeonardo also designed and built the Hidden Bolt, a weapon that could fire small crossbow bolts, upon the request of Francesco Vecellio . As Francesco was only an apprentice at the time, Ezio had not allowed him to use the Hidden Gun, and so Francesco had devised a similar, though lighter, alternative. [4] Hookblade \"The Hookblade helps you get around fast, surprise guards, and is not too bad in a fight.\" ―Yusuf Tazim to Ezio Auditore da Firenze [src] Yusuf showing the Hookblade to Ezio \nThe Hookblade was a modification of the Hidden Blade that was first adopted by the Assassin Brotherhood of Constantinople , from at least the time of the Ottoman Empire . Unlike the other Hidden Blade advancements, it was attached to the user's secondary Hidden Blade, instead of the primary. It consisted of both a curved hook and a regular blade, allowing it to be used for freerunning as well as combat. \nUpon his arrival in the city, Ezio was introduced to this advancement by Yusuf Tazim , who instructed the former in its application towards both battle and travel. Primarily, it could be used during navigation in conjunction with ziplines that were installed throughout Constantinople and allowing the Hookblade in double assassinations on guards below, as well as allowing one to perform the \"hook-and-run\" which able Assassins to flip over enemies to avoid a fight, and \"hook-and-throw\" maneuver to pull targets in for a close-range attack, or throw an enemy onto the ground, and generally extend one's reach when climbing and leaping. Ezio was later so impressed by the hookblade's uses and qualities that he later praised the hookblade, remarking that the Assassins back at Italy would love and appreciate the hookblade for its strength and agility. \nThe Hookblade also aided in battle by allowing a wider variety of attacks or counters, as well as permitting one to \" counter-steal \", tearing off an enemy's purse with the Hookblade, provoking them further and leaving them open to an easy counterattack. or trip an enemy. [2] \nFollowing this, the Hookblade could also be used to pull down scaffolds, subsequently slowing down or eliminating pursuers. This was particularly useful when done in conjunction with caltrop bombs . Hidden Footblade Edit Jun utilizing her Hidden Footblade \nFirst depicted in use by the Assassin Shao Jun, the Hidden Footblade was an adaptation to the Hidden Blade that allowed its users to maintain a low profile in areas where weapons were deemed restricted, as well as a method to surprise unsuspecting assailants with the combined use of blade and footwork, typically augmented through the studied use of leg-based martial arts. [10] [19] \nHowever, this tactic was not solely exclusive to the Assassin Order, as the French Templar and wife to the Rite's Grand Master François de la Serre prior to the French Revolution , Julie de la Serre , implemented the use of a Hidden Footblade in combat with two rogue Assassins, unknowingly employed to eliminate her and her daughter Élise on orders of the British Templar family, the Carrolls, despite Julie and Élise's association with Mrs. Carroll and her daughter, May . [17] Pivot Blade Edit Ratonhnhaké:ton stabbing Haytham Kenway with the Pivot Blade \nBy the 18th century, the Hidden Blade had become an even deadlier tool, thanks to the development of the Pivot Blade, which allowed its user to rotate the blade 90 degrees and wield it like a dagger. It could be held either in a hammer or icepick grip, allowing Assassins such as Ratonhnhaké:ton to quickly stab, cut, and slash their enemies. It could also be dual-wielded alongside a sword, dagger, or a tomahawk, allowing defensive parries and fierce counterattacks. The Pivot Blade could then be retracted into the Hidden Blade orientation for stealthy assassinations. When Ratonhnhaké:ton hunted wild game in the wilderness, the Pivot Blade also made the task of skinning less tedious than it would have been with a normal Hidden Blade. The blade was double-edged with one side serrated. This hidden blade could not be broken with an axe , due to its hardness, strength and flexibility. [11] Phantom Blade Edit Arno's Phantom Blade \nThe Phantom Blade was a variation of the traditional Hidden Blade utilized by the French Assassins during the French Revolution, taking inspiration from crossbows to condense one into a wrist-mounted form, making it both fast and deadly at long range. The Phantom Blade could be loaded with a projectile blade or a poisoned blade that caused the victim to attack others, allowing Assassins like Arno Dorian a silent kill or distraction, with room for further refinement through the firing mechanism to allow two shots per reload. [20] Trident Blade Edit Arbaaz Mir's three-pronged Trident Blade \nLike other mechanically modified Hidden Blades, the Trident Blade was a variation known to have been wielded by the Assassin Arbaaz Mir, of which the outer compartment could open out in a three-pronged fork, revealing another blade nested within. [9] Shock Blade Edit Concept art of the Shock Blade \nThe Shock Blade was a type of Hidden Blade used during the 21st century, which instead of a regular steel blade was equipped with two parallel stings, which upon penetration into the flesh of the target generated an electrical arc, adding electrocution to the stabbing. By 2015, some Assassins were equipped with this new kind of weapon, and Shaun Hastings used one of those to ambush and kill the high ranking Templar Isabelle Ardant . [8] Dual-rod Blade \nDuring the late 15th century, the Spanish Assassin Maria used a variation of the Hidden Blade with two blades next to one another. [21] Replicas \"The assassin leaps! As he lands upon the senator, a weapon protrudes from his wrist. Pierces his victim's neck!\" ―Fiora Cavazza observing an Assassin's technique. [src] \nIn their study of the Assassins' methods and weaponry, several members of the Templar Order created their own variations of the Hidden Blade, though the mechanism and appearance often differed. [4] Additionally the practice was not exclusive to the Order, some existing instances taken into account. Switchblade Edit Il Lupo's switchblade \nThe first known instance of this was in the early 16th century, when Fiora Cavazza and Baltasar de Silva tailed the Assassins of Rome, in order to take note of their techniques. They eventually trained Il Lupo in the Assassins' ways, and equipped him with a switchblade, a Hidden Blade variation that split into two parts, folding forward only when in use. [4] Lia de Russo also wore her own Hidden Blade, and though its mechanisms seemed to match that of the Assassins, it was worn on top of her forearm, rather than underneath. [18] Corvix Blade \nA replica of the Hidden Blade was designed by Demetrio il Silente based on blueprints stolen from Villa Auditore by the Crows . These replicas bore the symbol of a crow's head and were the preferred weapon of the group. [22] Hand-crafted \nWhile disguised as a slave in Chichen Itza , Aveline de Grandpré was forced to make replica Hidden Blades by scrounging up knives, belts and wood. The end result was deemed crude but effective. [23] Bi-jointed Edit \nIn modern times, during the second stage of simulations hosted by the Animi Training Program of Abstergo Industries , every recruit was given access to a variation of the Hidden Blade. The virtual weapon was also worn under the left forearm, but its blade folded along two circular joints when not being used. [2] Telescopic \nAs part of the console stage of Abstergo Entertainment 's Animus technology, the Animi Avatars contained within could use another variation of the Hidden Blade, this time possessing a two-part telescopic function to the mechanism. [11] Trivia Edit Design Patrice Désilets , one of the creative directors for the Assassin's Creed series , stated that the addition of a second blade in Assassin's Creed II also had a lucid reason: \"it's Assassin's Creed II , so there [were] two blades.\" Assassin's Creed: Renaissance and early concept art for Assassin's Creed II showed Ezio possessing three Hidden Blades; one on his right, and two on his left. The original design of Ezio's second Hidden Blade in Assassin's Creed II was displayed as a brown glove, however, in-game, it was replaced with a second bracer. This was reverted in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood however, where his second Hidden Blade included a glove, until a bracer had been purchased. Concept art for the \"Shock Blade\", a modern version of the Hidden Blade, was shown in the Assassin's Creed Encyclopedia . On his blog, Assassin's Creed concept artist Gilles Beloeil stated that the 21st century model of the hidden blade is much smaller, being 3.25 inches, yet still as effective as its older equivalents. It was shortened due to modern security systems, such as cameras. It is unknown why the Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood box art, E3 Trailer and other official media including the opening cinematics of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed III depict Ezio with a secondary Hidden Blade bracer that is identical to his primary one, as in-game, no such second bracer exists. The same happened with Ratonhnhaké:ton on the \"Ignite the Revolution\" poster and in the box art for Assassin's Creed III . In early concept art for Assassin's Creed III , rope darts were integrated onto the Hidden Blade's bracer, envisioned as the \"Chain Blade\". This concept was later modified to be closer to reality, resulting in the \"Chain Blade\" being scrapped for a more reasonable alternative. This would ultimately be developed into a grapple hook for the Hidden Blade in Assassin's Creed: Syndicate used by the twins Jacob and Evie Frye . The second Hidden Blade was marginally longer than the primary one in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood . Early images of Assassin's Creed: Revelations showed Ezio with a Hookblade on his left arm, rather than on his right. In these, the hook was incorporated directly onto the blade, rather than as a separate function. The actual hook of the Hookblade resembled the head of an eagle, a bird frequently associated with the Assassin Order. In various interviews and print media, Ubisoft Montreal stated that the Hookblade was intended to increase navigation speed by a factor of 30% in Revelations , in comparison to previous installments of the Assassin's Creed series. The Hookblade was considered for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag , but Darby McDevitt , the lead writer for Revelations and Black Flag , objected as he wanted to dispel the stereotype of hook-handed pirates . Unlike the Hidden Gun and Poison Blade , the Hookblade was applied alongside Ezio's secondary Hidden Blade, rather than as part of his primary one. One concept art by Martin Deschambault for Assassin's Creed II showed two unimplemented Hidden Blade upgrades; a retracting arrow-shaped blade, and a retracting trident-ended blade for parrying weapons and disarming enemies. His art also shows two designs of the blade itself; feather-look, and normal blade with designed holes. Noticeable differences with this concept and that of the Trident Blade aesthetically suggest that the design may have been used to create Arbaaz Mir's Hidden Blade. Mechanism In the E3 teaser trailer of Assassin's Creed , as well as in certain concept art, Altaïr could be seen pushing a button to operate his Hidden Blade. In-game however, no such button or other trigger mechanism existed. In Assassin's Creed: Renaissance and the Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood novel , unleashing the Hidden Blade required the use of a button, via a certain muscle on the forearm being flexed. The same mechanism also triggered the Hidden Gun if the user's thumb was pushed to the left. In an Assassin's Creed developer diary video, Jade Raymond spoke about the lack of Altaïr's ring finger and the Assassins' initiation ceremony. The Hidden Blade is a crafted item in Assassin's Creed: Project Legacy . The materials for its construction are 2 Coils, 1 Iron, 1 Hide and 1 Box of Components; the latter in turn being crafted using 3 Gears, 3 Screws, 1 Chain and 2 Sprockets. In Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade , the trigger mechanism was depicted as a ring worn around a finger. Movement of that finger would cause the blade to extend or retract. Custom says that the Hidden Blade is usually worn on the left hand, this is portrayed by Altaïr, which is the main cause of him cutting out his own finger to use it. Later a second blade was added in Assassin's Creed II. The closest novel adaptation of the Hidden Blade to the in-game version appears in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag , wherein Edward Kenway stated he had activated the blade by the tensing of a muscle that came from the upper arm as well as the forearm, and a simultaneous flick of the wrist. This is much unlike the ring-triggered or button mechanisms as mentioned in previous novels, thus more like the in-game Hidden Blade. However, this mechanism came with the dangerous risk of accidentally activating the Hidden Blade while flicking the wrist unintentionally, which could result in the death of a person or the wielder themselves. This is acknowledged in Assassin's Creed: Underworld , where Ethan Frye rested his chin on his left hand while wearing a Hidden Blade, with the blade itself less than an inch from his throat. Others In Assassin's Creed , despite being equipped with a Hidden Blade, some Assassins, such as Malik Al-Sayf , retained all fingers. This error was later corrected in Assassin's Creed: Revelations . Along with this, however, came another error. The Assassins retained amputated ring fingers even after Altaïr changed the design of the blade so that amputation was no longer necessary. In Assassin's Creed , the Hidden Blade was used in every major assassination. Even if an Assassin began by attacking their target with a sword, they would always finish them off with the Hidden Blade. Later however, it was changed so that they could use any weapon they wished. In Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines , if the PlayStation Portable was linked to Assassins Creed II , Altaïr's Hidden Blade could be upgraded to be able to block light and heavy attacks. In Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles , Altaïr could only use the Hidden Blade to assassinate an enemy from behind, if it was related to the story. There was a glitch in the Assassin's Creed II mission \" Practice What You Preach \", in that if Ezio went to the blacksmith and purchased the Leather Vambrace, instead of practicing the new assassination techniques, he could acquire the second Hidden Blade before Leonardo had even made it for him. The Hidden Blade could be used in Valve's Team Fortress 2 by the Spy class, under the name Sharp Dresser . It was available for those who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed: Revelations on Steam before 2 December 2011. In Assassin's Creed: Unity and Assassin's Creed: Syndicate , the Hidden Blade was restricted to stealth assassinations only, being no longer available to use in open combat. That said, Jacob and Evie would sometimes use the Hidden Blade in conjunction with their equipped weapon during kill animations. A similar device known as the \"Hidden Bolt\" was made by Leonardo da Vinci in the 1500s for Apprentice Francesco Vecellio . As he was not yet of the proper rank to use a Hidden Gun, the Hidden Bolt acted as a silent alternative which fired small crossbow bolts. This was very similar to the French Assassins' Phantom Blades centuries later. In Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed III: Liberation , some British and Spanish troops could perform an animation that was similar to the hook and run, which would temporarily disorientate Ratonhnhaké:ton and Aveline. There are several cutscenes in which Ezio's Hookblade is not actually on his wrist. Examples include his conversation with Yusuf in \" Setting Sail \" and whenever he recruits an Assassin.
