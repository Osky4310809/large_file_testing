We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.” \nWhile in a statement to Variety, Tim Ryan, the accounting firm’s US chairman and senior partner, said: \"Bill feels very, very terrible and horrible. \n“He is very upset about this mistake. And as a firm, given that he is a partner of our firm, it is also my mistake and our mistake and we all feel very bad.” \nOn Sunday, chaos ensued at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood after Faye, 76, said that musical movie La La Land had won the evening's biggest award after she and Hollywood legend Warren, 79, were given the wrong envelope before stepping onto the stage. \nAfter being told there was a mix-up, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz took to the mic and called up everyone who worked on Moonlight to the stage telling them that they were the real victors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:49:11.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
