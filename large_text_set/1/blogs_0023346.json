AP/Shizuo Kambayashi\nDelta Airlines is the latest company to fall into the path of President Donald Trump's Twitter account.\nTrump claimed that Delta's computer outage, which caused delays and more than 300 flight cancellations, was the source of troubles at airports over the weekend.\n\"Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage, protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer,\" tweeted Trump.\nTrump signed an executive order on Friday that banned inbound travel from seven Muslim-majority countries\nTrump's order halted refugee arrivals into the US for 120 days, and it barred citizens of Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for 90 days.\nThe president has faced criticism over the constitutionality of the order, federal judges have blocked parts of the ban, and widespread protests have broken out at airports around the US.\nThe computer outage was the second in six months for Delta and stranded passengers across the US.\n\"I want to apologize to all of our customers who have been impacted by this frustrating situation,” said Delta CEO Ed Bastian in a press release early Monday. “This type of disruption is not acceptable to the Delta family, which prides itself on reliability and customer service. I also want to thank our employees who are working tirelessly to accommodate our customers.\"\nDelta also issued a statement on Saturday saying they would \"make every effort\" to assist customers impacted by Trump's executive order.\n\"Delta will make every effort to contact impacted customers with flexible rebooking options including refunds,\" said the statement.\nFollowing the tweet and outage, Delta stock is slightly lower in trading. As of 9:30 a.m. ET, shares were down roughly 1.6% at $48.90.\nSEE ALSO: There are a lot of problems with Trump's 20% border tax idea NOW WATCH: Here's how to use one of the many apps to buy and trade bitcoin Loading video...
