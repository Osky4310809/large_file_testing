Paramedics provided care, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene. \nAn ambulance brought the other victim to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she is being treated for a non-life-threatening injury, police say. \nThe names of the victims have yet to be released. \nPolice say investigators are interviewing witnesses and recovering surveillance video from the scene. \nSo far, no arrests have been made. \nMayor Betsy Hodges released a statement on the shooting, which she described as the city’s first since the start of 2017. \n“One homicide is too many,” the mayor said. “[E]very victim leaves behind loved ones who grieve the loss. My heart is with those grieving today.” \nThe incident comes a day after three people were shot in downtown Minneapolis early Saturday morning. That incident happened near the intersection Third Street and First Avenue North. \nMinneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau said Sunday that the two incidents appear to be separate and unrelated. The cases are similar in that there were altercations before the shootings, and the victims in the shootings were the intended targets. \nThe victims are currently not cooperating with authorities. \nHarteau said Sunday that due to the weekend shootings, additional uniform and plain clothes officers will be allocated to the warehouse district. \nAnyone with information on the shooting is asked to call police at 612-692-8477 or leave an anonymous tip by texting 847411.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T01:24:29.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
