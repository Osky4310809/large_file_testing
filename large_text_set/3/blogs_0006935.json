Theo Walcott scored a fantastic goal and should have had a penalty when fouled by Xabi Alonso -- ironically denied by the same official who decided Koscielny should see red. \nArsenal looked like a team that might just restore some pride, but the sending off changed everything. After that, there was nothing positive to talk about beyond the final whistle. \nNegatives \nGoing down to 10 men in a game like this is always difficult, but there's an old cliche in football about how it can be harder to break down a team that is then focused on defending. Sadly, there was no focus on defending here; Arsenal played in a gung-ho manner and allowed themselves to be cut open far too easily in the final half hour. \nThere's a lack of organisation in circumstances like this and although Bayern are a high quality team, the gap between them and Arsenal should not be so great. At the moment it's like a chasm and the aggregate scoreline shows that. \nThis went beyond the usual round-of-16 exit; this was embarrassing. \nManager rating out of 10 \n3 -- Arsene Wenger can be happy with the way his team played in the first half, but ultimately it's his job to ensure they can cope better with difficult circumstances. At the moment, every problem seems them crumble and his substitutions did not lend themselves to defensive stability. \nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10 = best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating) \nGK David Ospina, 5 -- Shipped a hat full of goals again, but could barely be blamed for any of them. Was left hopelessly exposed after Arsenal went down to 10 men. \nDF Hector Bellerin, 4 -- Got forward well at times, but his final ball was poor. Was part of a defence that went AWOL in the last half hour. \nDF Shkodran Mustafi, 4 -- Is struggling to find the form he showed in the early stages of his career. Capable of fantastic passes, but sloppy too often. \nDF Laurent Koscielny, 5 -- His importance to the team is obvious; for the second game running, Arsenal went to pieces when he went off. The penalty was perhaps clumsy, but definitely not worthy of a red card. \nDF Nacho Monreal, 4 -- Did his best to control Arjen Robben during the first period and was generally successful. Was not offered much protection by the man in front of him, Alexis Sanchez. \nMF Aaron Ramsey, 5 -- Was a bright spot along with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. His high energy was a key part of how well Arsenal played in the first period. Created a great chance for Giroud, which was spurned. \nMF Granit Xhaka, 5 -- Ended up at centre-half for a while after Koscielny went off, which in some ways sums up his Arsenal career to date. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what his role is and you wonder if he even knows himself. \nMF Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, 5 -- Like Ramsey was one of the positives on the night with a hard-working performance, but if the best Arsenal have to offer right now is players putting in effort the problems lie very deep. \nMF Theo Walcott, 5 -- Produced the usual mix of poor control and then a goal out of nothing. Spurned chances before he scored, then blasted home an unstoppable shot. \nMF Alexis Sanchez, 4 -- Was wasteful in possession, culpable for one of the goals and then taken off, where he sat on the bench smiling . He is a fantastic player, but ostentatious shows of dismay are only really effective when you're not a contributory factor to that dismay. \nFW Olivier Giroud, 4 -- Wasted a couple of good chances -- the header early in the second half from the Ramsey cross should have put the Gunners 2-0 up. What then? Instead, he headed over. \nSubstitues \nMF Mesut Ozil, NR -- Came on and had little effect on proceedings. \nMF Francis Coquelin, NR -- Also came on and had little effect on the game. \nFW Lucas Perez, NR -- Must be looking forward to the FA Cup this weekend, a competition in which he usually starts and isn't thrown on to chase lost causes. \nAndrew Mangan is one of ESPN FC's Arsenal bloggers.
