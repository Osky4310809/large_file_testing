Lindsay Gypin, a roller derby \nskater, knows all too well about the challenges that life can throw your way through \nunexpected twists and turns. \n\nLindsay Gypin began her life on the track seven years ago, originally skating with a roller \nderby team in Castle Rock, Colorado. Like many skaters around that time, Lindsay drew \ninspiration from the movie Whip It and decided to give roller derby a try. She fell in love \nwith the sport, the physical contact, and the competitive nature that the sport provides. \nAs a fan of Star Wars and at the suggestion of her husband at the time, she went by the \nalter ego Menace – based on the phantom menace from Star Wars. \n\nWhile Lindsay may have started in roller derby as a hobby, she found the community \nshe needed when the adversity hit. Everyone faces hurdles, unfortunately for Lindsay, \nthose struggles piled up at the same time. In a very short period last year, Lindsay went \nthrough a divorce, had to sell her home and lost her job – her life was in a lot of upheavals. \nThrough the struggles, the one constant in her life was roller derby – it was the thing \nshe could turn to when the chips were down. \n\nLindsay decided to get her life back on track she needed to focus on herself – she \ncreated goals to work toward on the track, and off-track, she moved north from Castle \nRock to Denver, joined Denver Roller Derby (DRD) permanently and went back to school to get \nher masters in library sciences. Now Lindsay has a renewed focus in life, and she \ncredits roller derby for providing that support to help her right her life. “Roller Derby \nserved as a positive influence on my life. It taught me perseverance and allowed me to \ntake charge of transforming my life for the better.” Lindsay Gypin skating with Denver Roller Derby during the Besterns tournament in 2016.

Derby is a community that lifts people up and allows people to succeed \non and off the track. Off the track, she may be a librarian, but on the track her presence, \nfocus and athletic drive is anything but quiet. \n\nLindsay plays on the Shotgun Betties of the home teams with Denver Roller Derby and \nis also a member of DRD’s travel team, Mile High Club. \n\nOn Sat., Feb. 25, watch Menace and the Shotgun Betties take on the Green Barrettes in \nthe second half of a doubleheader.
