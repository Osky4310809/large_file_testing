It was full of juicy tidbits about possible collusion with Russia and blackmail, but all anyone seemed to care about was Trump’s alleged tryst with some Russian sex workers who were hired to defile a hotel bed slept in by Barack and Michelle Obama by peeing on it.\nPenthouse took note of the part of the document that said “the hotel was known to be under FSB control with microphones and concealed cameras in all the main rooms[.]” The dirty mag made a simple announcement: Anyone with footage of the pee party could get a quick $1 million by handing it over.\nATTENTION:\nWe are offering up to $1-million for exclusive rights to the FSB tapes of Trump’s #goldenshowers\n— Penthouse (@Penthouse) January 11, 2017\nAccording to the International Business Times , three people have come forward to claim they have footage of the events that supposedly took place in Moscow’s Ritz-Carlton. They don’t have any tapes yet, of course, but there is a chance they could soon.\nEditor Ralphie Aronowitz explained the mag’s decision to hunt for the clip like this:\nIf the story is real, which we don’t know if it is or not, it really kind of hits at the intersection between politics, scandal and sex, which as a brand both historically and currently is our sweet spot … For us, this was the type of story that we wanted to jump all over. But at the same time there’s been so much floating around – as far as fake news stories – there have been so many people who have just been taking shots at President-elect Donald Trump because he’s an easy target, and we as a brand and as an informational source, we didn’t want to jump on the bandwagon. We wanted to make sure this story could be verified, that the murmurings of their being actual video documentation that corroborates the allegations, do exist. For us, this was a very real ask, which is just “Give us some facts, and let us share the real story with our readers and with the public.”\nThat’s a very diplomatic statement for a very undignified-sounding video.\n[image: screengrab]\nLindsey: Twitter .
