Jeff Lipsky/ABC via Getty Images \nJimmy Kimmel will serve as the evening's master of ceremonies for the first time — he even asked Billy Crystal for advice based on the comedian's eight years of Oscar hosting experience. The late-night host, 49, will share the stage with presenters such as Amy Adams , Halle Berry , Scarlett Johansson , Dwayne Johnson and David Oyelowo , and performers Justin Timberlake , John Legend , Lin-Manuel Miranda and Sting , all of whom are recognized in the Best Original Song category. \nThe Damien Chazelle -directed La La Land leads the pack with 14 nominations, tying it with Titanic (1997) and All About Eve (1950) for the most nods for a single film in Oscar history. Titanic , Ben-Hur (1959) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) currently hold the record for most Academy Awards won by a single film, with each nabbing 11 statues. \nJust behind the movie musical starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is the emotional coming-of-age drama Moonlight and sci-fi mystery Arrival , both with eight nominations. Meryl Streep picked up her 20th nod, and if she takes home the Actress in a Leading Role prize for her part in Florence Foster Jenkins, her four Oscar victories would make her the winningest actress in the show’s history, tied with Katharine Hepburn . \nMake sure to check back throughout the show for updates as winners are announced, and read our by-the-minute live blog of the night's biggest moments! \nBest Picture", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:06:20.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
