One of those equipment options, FCA’s ZF-sourced nine-speed automatic transmission, returns impressive fuel economy for an all-wheel-drive crossover. \nThe 2017 Jeep Compass AWD with nine-speed auto is EPA-rated at 22/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s 1 mpg better in both city and highway mileage than the smaller Jeep Renegade AWD equipped with the same 2.4-liter I-4 and nine-speed combo. The 2.4-liter Tigershark MultiAir 2 I-4 makes 180 hp and 174 lb-ft of torque in the Compass, and is the crossover’s sole engine option. In addition to the nine-speed auto, the Compass can be paired to a six-speed auto or six-speed manual, and can also be had in front-wheel-drive form. EPA ratings for those drivetrain combinations are still pending. \nThe new Compass rides on the same architecture that underpins the Renegade, stretched nearly 8 inches on a 2.4-inch longer wheelbase. It’s still shorter than the Patriot it replaces, but is about the same width and height to give the Compass a more SUV-like driving experience. The Compass now splits the difference between the Renegade subcompact crossover and Cherokee compact crossover. \nStay tuned for EPA fuel economy numbers for the rest of the 2017 Jeep Compass lineup. \nSource: FuelEconomy.gov", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T05:20:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
