A New Yorker profile by Patrick Radden Keefe suggests that the real life Tony is a lot like the one on TV — except Bourdain himself is a detail-obsessed workaholic , who loves having a lot on his plate. This profile is a must-read for Bourdain fans and anyone who wonders how a show like Parts Unknown is made. Here are 10 big takeaways from the New Yorker profile: • B ourdain is extremely organized . After spending some time with the author/TV host, Radden Keefe observes that Tony is “controlled to the point of neurosis: clean, organized, disciplined, courteous, systematic.“ Bourdain’s buddy Eric Ripert also remarks: “He has his mise en place, ” referring to the ingredient station that a chef sets up before service. • B ourdain is 15 minutes early to every appointment , and he says he can tell a lot about other people based on whether or not they’re on time: “I judge other people on it... Today, you’re just late, but eventually you will betray me .” • B ourdain has a hands-on approach to his many media projects . In addition to starring in Parts Unknown , Tony also writes his voice-over scripts, and offers input on the cinematography, music, and location selection. He’s also still writing and he recently did a live tour of America. Bourdain says: “I’m a guy who needs a lot of projects... I would probably have been happy as an air-traffic controller .” • B ourdain is not immune to stress . During the filming of the Vietnam episode of Parts Unknown featuring President Barack Obama , he even took up smoking again. “Three years I haven’t had a cigarette, and I just started again,” Bourdain tells Radden Keefe in Hanoi. • B ourdain has a big vision for his New York City food hall : “Imagine a post-apocalyptic Grand Central Terminal, if it had been invaded by China.” The market, which will feature dozens of his favorite vendors from around the world, is still slated to open at Manhattan’s Pier 57 in a few years. It’s going to have restaurants from celebrate NYC chefs, like April Bloomfield , as well as stalls from street vendors and night market mainstays. “If the younger Korean hipsters and their grandparents like us, we’re gonna be O.K.,” Bourdain quips. Tony explains that it will not be a place catering to “the gringos.” • B ourdain thinks writing is not as hard as cooking brunch , and he’s cooked a lot of brunch in his day. Tony brags: “ Three hundred brunches , nothing came back... Three hundred eggs Benedict. Not one returned. It’s mechanical precision. Endurance. Character. That’s real .” • B ourdain says that he has no end date in sight for Parts Unknown : “I have the best job in the world... If I’m unhappy, it’s a failure of imagination.” • B ourdain doesn’t see himself as a statesmen , even though his publisher thinks otherwise. After traveling through Southeast Asia, Tony also says that he could never rub shoulders with Henry Kissinger : “Any journalist who has ever been polite to Henry Kissinger, you know, fuck that person... I’m a big believer in moral gray areas, but, when it comes to that guy, in my view he should not be able to eat at a restaurant in New York.” • Bourdain turns restaurants into tourist destinations, and he doesn’t feel great about that : “It’s a gloriously doomed enterprise ... I’m in the business of finding great places, and then we fuck them up.” • B ourdain loves being Bourdain , but he also knows that success can be fleeting. His publisher, Dan Halpern, tells the New Yorker : “For a long time, Tony thought he was going to have nothing... He can’t believe his luck. H e always seems happy that he actually is Anthony Bourdain .” The New Yorker ’s Bourdain profile is accompanied by some excellent photography, including a shot of Tony getting slammed to the floor during a jujitsu match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:34:32.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
