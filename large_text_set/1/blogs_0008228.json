If a trademark application unearthed by Dutch blog GSMinfo is to be believed, the assistant will be called Viki. It will be joining a crowded field that includes Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, Alexa and Samsung’s rumoured addition, Bixby. \nNokia’s trademark application is for “software for the creation and monitoring of mobile and web digital assistants working with knowledge and combining all data sources into a single chat and voice based interface ”. The trademark application doesn’t reveal anything about the functionality of Nokia Viki. However, it is expected to offer a similar functionality to other virtual assistants like Siri. \nIn related news, HMD Global, the new home of Nokia devices, has introduced its first Nokia-branded Android smartphone called the Nokia 6 at CES. It is a mid-range offering with a metal unibody design, a 5.5-inch full HD display, a Snapdragon 430 octa-core SoC, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, 16MP/8MP cameras, and a 3,000mAh battery. It will be available in China soon for the equivalent of around Rs 16,500.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T11:08:16.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
