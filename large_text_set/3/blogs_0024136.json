While Schefter’s duties as an NFL reporter takes up most of his year, the deadest months of his sport come during the meat of the NBA season. Since he has become a diehard basketball fan, Schefter described this assignment as “100 percent fun” for him.\nStill, when Schefter showed up on the ESPN broadcast on Wednesday, it alarmed many Twitter users.\nSo Adam Shefter has become an NBA Insider... pic.twitter.com/h30PTyf8oX \n— Alex Hale (@ThatCLESportGuy) March 23, 2017 And when Schefter tweeted a fact about Paul Millsap’s contract, who was playing in the game he was covering, Twitter damn near had an uprising. Here’s the tweet.\nPaul Millsap could void deal paying him $21.4M next season. Could get max 5-year, $207M with Hawks, or 4-year, $154M with other teams.\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 23, 2017 And here is a look at the replies.\n@AdamSchefter I don't speak Spanish.\n— Joe Goodberry (@JoeGoodberry) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter not football\n— HoldenCantor (@HoldenCantor) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter STICK TO FOOTBALL\n— Kaley (@kaley8711) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter NOT FOOTBALL ADAM\n— Hal Jordan (@NO_TATS_B) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter Seattle finally has their left tackle\n— Justis Mosqueda (@JuMosq) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter STICK TO FOOTBALL pic.twitter.com/5OCyLjX1hk \n— Nate (@nate2usmc) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter you hacked?\n— Hayes Jansen (@H_Jansen11) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter is that football\n— Dave Shreeve (@DaveShreeve) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter basketball?\n— Mike Schilling (@mschill_65) March 23, 2017 The other theme in his mentions was Twitter users calling him Woj — or Adrian Wojnarowski at The Vertical, who is the Adam Schefter of the NBA.\n@AdamSchefter DOG IS YOU WOJ?? pic.twitter.com/4OJX8MQtGk \n— nubz (@J_Nubz) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter Woj you're on your wrong account\n— HottyToddyGMenLAC (@NYGFans10) March 23, 2017 @AdamSchefter I think Adam is secretly Woj and sometimes forgets to switch accounts\n— #EnunwaHive (@Patriotssuck19) March 23, 2017 Schefter had to know this would happen, given his tweets have been nearly 100 percent about the NFL up to this point.
