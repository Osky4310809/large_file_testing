In commemoration of him, Apple is naming a 1,000-seat auditorium on campus the “Steve Jobs theater.” It features a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder at the entrance, Apple explained, and sits “atop a hill – one of the highest points within Apple Park – overlooking meadows and the main building.”\nThe building is powered by 17 megawatts of solar panels, allowing it to operate completely on renewable energy. Other amenities include a 100,000 square-foot fitness center, 9,000 trees and two miles of walking paths.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:01:34.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
