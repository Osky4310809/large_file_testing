We pick 10 potential options for Jurgen Klopp The German boss is expected to bring at least one forward to Anfield in the next transfer window Share Which of these front men will Klopp go for?

Could   \nLiverpool have all the creative attackers they could ever need, now they just need a man to finish it off. \nBrendan Rodgers had his SAS in Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez - which almost grabbed them the title three seasons ago. \nBut the former has since seemed to have a season ticket for the physio bench while the latter has become a cog in the MSN goal machine at Barcelona. \nSo if Jurgen Klopp is to celebrate the Premier League crown he craves he will need to splash the cash on a front man or two. \nHere is our rundown of the eccentric German's 10 best options... Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Aubameyang scores brilliant goal in training Share this video Watch Next Alexis Sanchez \nCurrent Arsenal sulker Sanchez should be No.1 on the Reds’ summer hit list – although they will have to break the bank to secure his services. \nThe Chilean ace could be the much awaited replacement for Luis Suarez at the head of their attack, with his pace, tricky feet and finishing abilities. Sanchez is highly unlikely to be at the Gunners next season (Photo: Arsenal/Getty) \nHe already knows the Premier League and even if his head has been turned by a return to the continent, Sanchez could double back when he sees the chance of Champions League football on offer. \nHaving a mixture of Philippe Coutinho, Sadio Mane, Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino to link up with up front is a truly frightening prospect for the Premier League defences. \nAlthough the worry is his height would let him down, with the Reds already bereft of height in their current attacking options. Alexandre Lacazette Lacazette is a long term target (Photo: AFP) \nLyon striker Lacazette and Premier League club is becoming as famous a love story as Romeo and Juliet or Twilight. \nSurely, one of England’s elite will finally persuade him to jump across the Channel? \nWell the Reds have been a long term admirer and he would fit into their mould perfectly – they will just have to dig deep into their reserves – with a price tag of £35m on the Frenchman. \nThey will also have to fight it out with Atletico Madrid who have reportedly verbally agreed a move – although a lot can happen in six months. Maxwel Cornet If Lacazette is unavailable Cornet might be (Photo: Getty) \nIf Lacazette choose one of his tens of other suitors maybe Klopp can sneak under the radar to sign his younger model at Lyon Cornet. \nThe France under 21 star has been watched by Reds scouts this year and could be an ideal recruit. \nThe problem is he is not prolific – having only found the net 11 times in Ligue 1 since his debut in 2015. \nPerhaps not the man to solve the attacking crisis on Merseyside but one to start a legacy. Javier Hernandez The \"Little Pea\" is a safe bet (Photo: Dean Mouhtaropoulos) \nIf Jose Mourinho had been made Manchester United manager instead of Louis van Gaal in the fateful summer of 2014, we might view Hernandez as a Premier League legend. \nThe Portuguese boss admitted recently he would have kept the “Little Pea” rather than ship him out on loan to Real Madrid and then sell him to Bayer Leverkusen. \nA return to the north-west of England could suit both parties as he knows the area and the league. \nThe Reds have not really had a player of his sort – a short goal pouncer – since home grown hero Michael Owen. Mauro Icardi Icardi could be explosive (Photo: Giuseppe Bellini) \nLast summer there were rumours ahoy of Inter Milan front man Icardi closing in on a move to Anfield. \nThe switch didn’t happen, after the Argentine made up with the Serie A side’s ultras, following a blazing row. \nHis predatory instincts and fiery temper draws comparisons to Suarez – and his 20 goals this season in a poor Inter side have propelled them towards a potential Champions League place. Kasper Dolberg Is Dolberg the new Ibrahimovic? (Photo: VI Images via Getty) \nThe most interesting thing about Dolberg, other than his exceptional footballing ability, is that he seems to only has one facial expression – go search if you don’t believe me. \nAway from his super serious face, the Ajax man has netted 13 times this season to draw obvious comparisons to Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nKlopp is a huge fan of the Denmark ace, and has called him “fantastic player” with a “great future” – will that future be at Anfield though? Jamie Vardy Vardy scores plenty of Premier League goals (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nA constant menace to defences when he is in the mood – and has a flawless goalscoring record to boot. \nVardy has been off the pace a tad this season but four goals in his last five games proves the ability is still there when he turns it on. \nHe’s no spring chicken at 30 years-old and will still be overpriced after his Premier League winning escapades. \nIt would also be the perfect finale to the Vardy story – playing for a genuinely huge club. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Klopp knows Aubameyang very well (Photo: 2016 Getty Images) \nThe Borussia Dortmund striker will have to ward off plenty of suitors but could he say no to his former boss? \nKlopp has hinted he is \"hoping to use his Dortmund ties\" to bring the 30-goal front man to the Premier League. \nAubameyang has already declared his desire to leave the Bundesliga club in the summer and his speed would make him fit into the Reds' style. \nManchester City could be heavy rivals for the Gabonese striker. Andrea Belotti Belotti has huge talent but a large price tag (Photo: LightRocket via Getty Images) \nBelotti was the subject of a £19.5m bid from the Reds last summer, although that price tag was raised to £55m when Arsenal allegedly swoop in January. \nTorino hung on to their king of inflation, who has an €100m release clause, in those windows but it seems unlikely he will still be at the club at the end of this summer. \nThe 23-year-old is good in the air, holding the ball up, but also lethal in front of goal - which could allow Klopp to move to a plan B with slightly more ease. Moussa Dembele Dembele has torn through the Scottish Premiership this season (Photo: PA Wire) \nNot since John Hartson and Henrik Larsson at the beginning of the century has the Scottish Premiership had a top scorer who looks like they could do it could of the border. \nFormer Fulham hot shot Dembele has netted 17 times in the league this season to help Celtic all but secure the title – the Hoops have not lost a game all season. \nDembele could be the natural successor to injury jinxed Daniel Sturridge but Liverpool will have to fight off some big names for his signature. poll loading How many strikers do Liverpool need to sign this summer? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:15:34.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
