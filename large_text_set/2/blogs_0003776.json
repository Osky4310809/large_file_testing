The dispute surfaced after Conway posted a link on her Twitter account to a Mediaite story saying the New York times had reported that CNN did not want to have Conway on the show because of her “credibility” issues. \n“False. I could do no live Sunday shows this week BC of family. Plus, I was invited onto CNN today & tomorrow,” Conway said. False. I could do no live Sunday shows this week BC of family. Plus, I was invited onto CNN today & tomorrow.

Those are the facts,” they stated. \n. @KellyannePolls was offered to SOTU on Sunday by the White House. We passed. Those are the facts. \n— CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 6, 2017 \nMSNBC’s “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski responded to CNN’s statement, implying that her network had also declined to have Conway appear on their Sunday shows. “You are not the first,” Brzezinski said. . @CNNPR @KellyannePolls you are not the first. \n— Mika Brzezinski (@morningmika) February 6, 2017 \nThe controversy comes after Conway cited a “Bowling Green massacre” as a terrorist attack to defend Trump’s immigration executive order. That massacre never happened. Conway expressed that it was an honest mistake and that she meant to say “Bowling Green terrorists” when referring to a 2011 incident in Bowling Green, Kentucky, when two Iraqi refugees were arrested on terrorism related charges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:38:30.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
