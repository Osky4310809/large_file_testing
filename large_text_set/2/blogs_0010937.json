Disney We’re not sure what we love about this picture most. First of all, we’re super excited for how totally gorg this movie looks — the production value looks sky high, and we were already excited to see one of our childhood faves brought to life. Second of all, Cogsworth and Lumiere are so small? Like, they are a SO SMALL. We can’t wait to watch tiny Emma Watson stroll through this massive palace while talking to tiny, tiny people. This is a matryoshka doll of cute.\nBut also now that Beauty and the Beast is live action, we have to put ourselves in Belle’s shoes and imagine what our reaction would be to finding out that decorations that appear to have been purchased at Cost Plus World Market are not just sentient but also capable of a rousing musical number.\nAnd lastly, we can’t help but think, “ohmygod that expression is so Hermione Granger after Harry and Ron have, once again, not done their homework.” \nBring it on, Disney. Our bodies are ready.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:19:59.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
