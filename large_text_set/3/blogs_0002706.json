That’s why I’ve decided to be a huge dong about it and insult some of the regional hamburger places that get oh so much love. OBSERVE! Shake Shack \n(source) \nThis is a part of my ongoing east coast/west coast beef — Shake Shack is too damn expensive. Like, it is a small hamburger that yes, is delicious, but it’s like… man I don’t need to be dropping like 17 bucks on a burger, fries, and shake. Whataburger \n(source) \nThere are no Whataburgers in Southern California where I love (LIKE A KING I MIGHT ADD), so every time one of my Texas friends comes to visit, I have to listen to them complain about how In-N-Out Burger isn’t as good as Whataburger. Texas is lowkey on New York City’s trail in terms of its citizens immediately telling you they're from Texas, and the thing they have in Texas is better than the thing you have where you live. So I’m taking that out on Whataburger. Steak ‘n Shake \n(source) \nSteak ‘n Shake is being murdered by its current CEO, Sardar Biglari. The guy is remaking Steak ‘n Shake, a place that is known for its table service and extensive menu, into a leaner counter service version and it’s much worse than it used to be! Don’t ruin the experience that people once loved (although I have had people from the midwest insist that this place has always been bad, and mostly for teenagers who are staying out late and have nowhere else to go.) White Castle \nThey could have ads in the paper offering to PAY me money to eat White Castle's disgusting square burgers, and I still wouldn’t take them up on the offer. Dick’s Drive-In \nThere are only six of these in the Seattle/Tacoma area, so it goes on here simply because it’s mean to brag so much about something that is so hard to experience. Tommy’s Original \n(source) \nI live by the original Tommy’s Original in Los Angeles, and sometimes there is a line of cars waiting just to get in the parking lot. I chock this phenomenon up to people enjoying going to the original location of things, because Tommy’s is the most “perfectly fine\" burger place on this entire list. The chili is almost more of a sauce, the ingredients are fresh but not exceptional, it’s… all good. But it's just good. There are locals here in southern California that… man, they just go crazy for this place. Cook Out \n(source) \nThis chain is sort of spread out throughout the south, and I will admit; it looks and sounds incredible. But I included Cook Out on this list because of the haunted look people get in their eyes when they mention it; truly, this place has an evil power over the people from out-of-state who have eaten there. I do not trust it. In-N-Out \n(source) \nlol are you insane, I would never besmirch In-N-Out. It is the greatest of the great hamburger chains. My only real problem with it is that you should never go to the one in Hollywood; it’s literally always busy, and the bad parking lot messes up all of the traffic around it. \nI AM NOT AFRAID OF YOUR HATRED, FOR I AM A SMUG CALIFORNIAN!
