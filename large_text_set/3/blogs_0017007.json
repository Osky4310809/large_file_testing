"Teenager attacked by crocodile at Innisfail Grace Mason,Clare Armstrong and AAP, The Courier-Mail March 19, 2017 12:46pm Renewed calls for croc cull \nAN Innisfail teen attacked by a crocodile after jumping in for a dare managed to escape its jaws by punching it in the head. \nLee De Paauw, 18, is undergoing surgery today after his left arm was nearly ripped off by the croc after he had jumped off the wharf at the Johnstone River at Innisfail about 2.20am. \nIt is understood Mr De Paauw had been climbing out of the water when the reptile latched onto his left arm, but he managed to escape it by using his right arm to punch it. \nQueensland Ambulance Service senior operations supervisor Neil Noble said initial reports were the man’s arm had been amputated in the attack, but this was not the case. \nHe said it was believed the man had been dared by friends to jump into the known croc habitat. \nThe group were reportedly consuming alcohol at the time. \nMr Noble said it is believed the 18-year-old was “revelling with friends” when he jumped into the crocodile infested waters as a “dare”. \n“Circumstances that led up to this attack are quite sketchy but reports from the scene are that he was dared to jump into the water, which he did. media_camera Innisfail man Lee De Paauw, 18, punched a crocodile which attacked him after he jumped into the Johnstone River. \n“Unfortunately the area is well known for its crocodile population and we’re grateful that he survived this incident because it could have turned out to be quite fatal,” the spokesman said. \nThe spokesman said the 18-year-old boy was due to undergo surgery for “extensive injuries” to his arm. \n“Initially it was reported that his harm had been amputated however that is not the case,” he said. \nHe said the boy’s friends were able to quickly get him out of the water which potentially saved his life. \n“To get him out of the water was absolutely vital in case that crocodile was able to get a good grip on him and do the death roll and drown him which is I believe often the case,” he said. \nThe paramedic said the public needed to remain vigilant around known animal habitats. \n“It’s really important to remember that we as humans are going into the habitat of these animals and they’re unprotected waters and we’re out in the wild, it’s to be expected that if you’re close to a shark or crocodile and splashing around in the water then you are in its habitat and to be very mindful about what you do,” he said. \nEARLIER: A TEENAGER has been seriously injured after he was attacked by a crocodile at Innisfail this morning. \nThe 18-year-old male suffered serious injuries to his arm after a crocodile reportedly attacked him when he jumped into the Johnstone River at Innisfail some time before 2:30am this morning. \nParamedics were called to the scene and the teen was taken to Innisfail hospital before he was transferred to the Cairns Hospital.

In May 2016 New Zealand-born photographer Cindy Waldron died after she was dragged under water by a 4.3m saltwater crocodile while walking with a friend at Thornton Beach, north of Cairns. \nMeanwhile, police are conducting an air and sea search for a man missing in waters off Innisfail since yesterday. \nThe 35-year-old Cairns man was spear fishing alone in waters between Palmer Point and High Island, north of Innisfail on Saturday. \nPolice commenced a search for the man at about 6pm after his unoccupied dingy was found anchored off Palmer Point and his spear gun was discovered floating nearby. \nPrivate vessels already in the general area joined Innisfail Police and a Volunteer Marine rescue team as they conducted an air and sea search for the missing fisherman. \nPolice divers from Brisbane will travel to the area today to assist with the ongoing search.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T04:04:14.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
