Credit: Paul Grover Ben Farmer , Defence Correspondent   \nP arts of the country are being cut off from their historical military links as the Ministry of Defence ends funding to a string of Army regimental museums, it has been warned. \nMore than a dozen museums are set to lose their money in April as the MoD scales back funds used to pay for curators and staff. \nSeveral of the museums have already closed their doors in advance and moved to share premises with other regiments. Others are hoping to stay open by raising money elsewhere. Military heritage at risk | Regimental museums losing MoD funding in 2017 \nM ilitary figures said the cuts risked robbing parts of the country of links to their historic local regiments. \nThey come as part of a long agreed MoD plan to reduce the number of Army museums it funds from 67 to 36 by the end of next decade. By then the MoD will fund only one museum for each of the current British Army regiments. \nOther collections commemorating historic regiments which amalgamated in recent decades to form modern day units will have to find other ways of staying open. \nBut the MoD funding cut comes as many museums face a double blow by losing local government grants because of deep austerity cuts to council budgets. \nThere are also fears the next round of MoD funding cuts to museums, when more are due to lose their money in 2030 will now be brought forward because of Treasury pressure on the MoD to make savings. We are losing our footprint around the country sadly and we are losing our roots in areas where we might have recruited quite heavily in the past Doug Beattie \nB rig Allan Mallinson, a military historian and former commander of the 13 th /18 th Royal Hussars, said military history was slipping away in parts of the country. \nHis regiment, amalgamated into the Light Dragoons in 1992, has now had to close its museum near Barnsley, and move into its sister museum in Newcastle. \nHe said: “That of course has meant that we have lost any permanent footprint in a major part of our recruitment area.\" \nHe went on: “What the impact is, it’s very, very difficult to say, but we know that the MoD and others place a high value on direct links with traditional recruiting areas.” \n“In other areas of the heritage industry, localism plays a strong role. There are any number of museums around the country to local industrial history and local art. It seems odd that we are prepared to see local military history slip away.” \nThe loss of links with local areas comes as the Army is more than 3,000 regular soldiers undermanned and struggling to hit its recruiting targets. \nDoug Beattie, a former officer with the Royal Irish Regiment and now a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, said: “We are losing our footprint around the country sadly and we are losing our roots in areas where we might have recruited quite heavily in the past.” \nCol Richard Kemp, formerly of the Royal Anglian Regiment, said the closure of barracks, bases and museums meant many parts of the country were losing their ties with the Armed Forces. \nHe said: “I think it’s detrimental in terms of local people understanding what the forces are doing for them, but I think also to an extent it could impact recruiting.” \nAn MoD spokeswoman said: “We recognise the important contribution made by these museums in preserving military heritage and acting as the bridge between communities and the Army. \n“This is why, irrespective of funding, they will continue to receive support and have close ties with their associated regiment.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:07:27.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
