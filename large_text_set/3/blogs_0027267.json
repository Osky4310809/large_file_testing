My mum passed away last year with cancer she was a respected woman of our community and did anything for anyone. My mum was the most kind hearted woman you could wish to meet. My mum and dad have lived in Blythe Bridge approximately 30 years. My dad has been a caretaker/group site supervisor of the local schools in Blythe Bridge and surrounding areas. They were also foster carers and have fostered over 500 - 600 children throughout stoke on trent.I am also starting this petition because at the moment we have been told that we cannot have a headstone in our local graveyard which is approximately 5 minutes away as it's \"closed\". I am also in a wheelchair so this graveyard is easier for me to get to, we do have one in forsbrook, but to go to there I have to go on the road to get to the graveyard as it's not wheelchair friendly, and the third one is carmountside which I will have to get a taxi there and back if I wanted to go on my own. I also have two brothers who are mentally handicapped, for me to take them with me if i had to travel in a taxi would be difficult. Being told that we cannot have anything but a plant pot as a family, but for me it has destroyed me even more as I was close to my mum, my mum was my best friend, still is my best friend, since losing her I suffer from anxiety and depression - sometimes I wish our roles were reversed. All i want is somewhere to visit, to be able to talk to her. Speak with her. Leave flowers for her. Everyone deserves a chance to visit their loved ones so why can't i? It's easy for anyone to get to a place but for me to do that in a wheelchair its hard . For anyone else having the headstone far away wouldn't be a problem. So this is why i have taken this route, i never wanted to. I hoped that they would help me but unfortunately that isn't the case. read petition letter â–¾ \nMy mum passed away last year with cancer she was a respected woman of our community and did anything for anyone.
