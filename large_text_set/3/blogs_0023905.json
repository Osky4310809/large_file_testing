This workout comprises a warm up, and four exercises using the rowing machine and bodyweight, repeated for 30 minutes total. \"Work your way through this list for five total rounds, and if you need to, take a one minute break after the completion of an entire cycle,\" said Xavier\nRelated:\nMeet the New Workout You'll Be Begging to Come to Your City\nHere's Xavier's \"classic\" warmup:\n30 seconds of jumping jacks 30 seconds running in place 30 seconds butt kickers 30 seconds plank hold 1 minute break (grab a sip of water!) And now for the workout:\nRower: 3 Minutes The rower is undoubtedly one of the most underrated pieces of equipment at the gym. \"Sometimes the best cardio comes from the machine you're not using,\" Xavier told POPSUGAR.\n\"Keep your posture tall, drive through the legs, and pull the handle to your upper abdomen, keeping your elbows in by your side and shoulders down and back,\" he explained. \"The overall row should feel smooth and consistent during both the backward motion (called the drive) and the forward motion (called the recovery). Work for a finishing distance between 500m and 700m, and try to to beat your record each time you're back on the rower. This will get heart rate up in no time and start your workout in an elevated state.\"\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["http://www.speedplayla.com/instructors", "http://www.speedplayla.com/", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/J6dn_zmJyZreWuLT7gbBjsQim70/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/20/042/n/1922729/3bc051f4cde9c898_untitled-1331_1_ladies_first_events.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-20T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:57:45.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
