He has been a constant voice from the left that it is a problem that needs to be urgently addressed. \nAs Independent Journal Review notes, another area where Maher parts company from those on the left is on free speech. \nOn his recent show, he discussed the U.C. Berkeley riots and free speech. \nAt ~41:00-43:00: \nConservative Tomi Lahren stated that there was nothing good about the riots. \n“Nothing that happened at U.C. Berkeley the other night was good. It was militant. It was a riot. It was not a protest.” \nMaher responded, noting that he had invited Milo Yiannopolous to be on the show. \n“They protested someone that I think we’ve booked on our show.

That is a problem on the left that we need to deal with very much so.” \nMaher then said, “Free speech should be something we [meaning liberals] own.” \nBut the problem is that that liberals have become so far left and so “progressive” that they are unable to tolerate any opinion other their own. \nAny other opinion must be shut down or shut up. \nThey even chant it in their protests. “If we don’t get it, shut it down” is a common chant. \nWhat “it” is may often vary, but ultimately it’s about doing what they want, despite facts or whatever concerns anyone else may have. \nIf you do not comply, you will not be allowed to operate your business, drive through the intersection they’re blocking or have a speaker they don’t like on a college campus. \nMaher is a little like a voice in the leftist wilderness on this one, but hopefully he can reach some… LIKE this article?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:06:14.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
