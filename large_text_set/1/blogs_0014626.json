It’s been a while since you played a truly villainous role. \nKeaton : Yeah, Vulture, recently. But not to give too much away, but interestingly, he is and he isn’t, that character. He’s a really interesting — and more interesting than I thought — villain because there’s parts of him that you go, “You know what? I might see his point.” Really, really. It makes it interesting to play. \nVariety : Was there any hesitation, because you had done Batman, going back into the superhero universe? \nKeaton : No, I mean, not at all. It’s just a thing. A gig. I don’t mean it’s just a gig, it’s the next job. And you think you can do it or want to do it and in fact I said no, because I couldn’t, it didn’t work in my schedule. Then I’m glad to say, they kind of shifted the scheduling and it worked out. So it fit in and I’m glad I did it. \nMichael Keaton has turned down many famous roles , including foregoing a $15 million paycheck for Batman Forever because — in his words — it “sucked,” so getting him to play Vulture apparently took some schedule shuffling on Marvel’s part. You’d think Keaton — post- Batman and Birdman — would have accepted it just to play yet another winged character.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T14:21:12.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
