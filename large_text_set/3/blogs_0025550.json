You can now use reactions during group conversations, as well as tag specific people using the ‘@’ symbol. \nThe reactions are useful for the same reason they are on Facebook proper – they give you more ways to acknowledge you’ve read a post and express your feelings towards it instead of a generic Like. In fact, Messenger also offers a thumbs down reaction, something you can’t use on Facebook. Here it’s probably meant to serve more as a ‘no’ than a ‘dislike’ button, which will come in handy for, say, deciding what restaurant to eat at with a group of friends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:03:04.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
