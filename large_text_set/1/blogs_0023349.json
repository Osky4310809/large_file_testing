Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., accused critics of President Trump 's immigration ban of hypocrisy, pointing out that few complained when former President Barack Obama ended the nation's asylum program for Cubans just days before leaving office. \n\"I am struck by the double standard and hypocrisy of those who are offended by this executive order, but who failed to challenge President Obama when he took similar action against Cuban refugees, especially since President Obama's action was meant to appease the Castro regime and not for national security reasons,\" Diaz-Balart said in a statement Monday. \nDiaz-Balart, a Cuban American, is a Republican who represents South Florida, which is home to many Cuban migrants. \nObama on January 12 ended the nation's \"wet-foot, dry-foot\" policy which for the past two decades had allowed Cubans to remain legally in the United States if they were able to set foot on U.S. land. The Cuban government had been seeking an end to the policy and it followed Obama's decision to renew diplomatic and economic ties with the country, which is still controlled by a dictatorship. \nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.   the Daily on Defense newsletter.   issue soon! \nDiaz-Balart said he supported Trump's decision to temporarily ban refugees from seven countries with terrorism problems. \n\"While it is always legitimate to express concerns with presidential executive orders, I understand the president's primary responsibility is to keep the American people safe,\" Diaz-Balart said. \"The ban is only temporary until the administration can review and enact the necessary procedures to vet immigrants from these countries. The ban is based on countries the Obama administration identified as 'countries of concern' and not based on a religious test.\" Top Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T22:14:59.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
