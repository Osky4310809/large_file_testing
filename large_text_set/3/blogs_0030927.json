It's literally impossible to miss from here (Photo: ASTV) \nUnselfishly, the fella who did all the hard work squares the ball past Lucas Acosta (Belgrano's keeper) to his teammate. \nTomas Andrade, who came on eight minutes prior, only needs to tap the ball into the back of the net. How did this happen? (Photo: ASTV) \nHowever, the Argentine midfielder softly side-foots the ball towards goal giving the goalkeeper a slim chance of saving it. \nAcosta doesn't waste his opportunity and somehow races back to brilliantly clear the ball off the line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:50:39.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
