[Left] Me in Real life = blemishes, lines & flaws.” Susannah Reid make-up free selfie (Photo: Instagram @susannareid100) \nShe continued: “There's a time & value for both but don't compare your behind-the-scenes to others' highlights reels. Happy Being You Year!” \nIt didn't take long for Susanna's Instagram post to become flooded with positive messages. \nHer message comes after she recently clashed with her co-host Piers Morgan on the morning TV show over the subject of ageing, where he said it should be “resisted at all costs”. Susanna Reid and Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain (Photo: ITV) \nSusanna declared that she felt “every inch” of her 46 years and described it as a “blessing”. \n\"Age is to be welcomed and a blessing,” the mother-of-three said. \n\"It is a good thing to get older, isn't it? Consider the alternative…\" \nPiers was adamant that ageing should be considered “a curse” and that noone actually wanted to get older. \nHis intelligent co-hosts pointed out that he didn't have much choice in the matter so probably wasn't much point in resisting it.
