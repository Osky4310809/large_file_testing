Cressida Dick commanded the operation in which innocent Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead by police \nThe Brazilian electrician was killed by firearms officers in a Tube carriage at Stockwell station after being mistaken for a terrorist who they believed was about to detonate a suicide bomb. \nWhen the force was later prosecuted for breaching health and safety laws she told the Old Bailey that she used the word “stop” and expected a “conventional armed challenge” from firearms officers. After convicting the Met, the jury cleared Ms Dick of any blame. \nIn later interviews she described his death as a “terrible tragedy” saying she believed he was the victim of “the most extraordinary and terrible circumstances.” \nShe added: “It was my job and my duty to get on with it. I had to explain what happened, tell the truth and stand up and be counted.” \nKnown for her cool and calm head in running complex inquiries, she gained admiration for her resilience and was promoted up the ranks despite coming under scrutiny over the shooting. \nMs Dick left the Met in 2014 soon after she was moved from her role as head of counter terror policing, a position she held since 2011. She took up a secretive director-general post at the Foreign Office.
