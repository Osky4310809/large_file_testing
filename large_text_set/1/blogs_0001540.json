watch guide \nIt all comes down to this. Sunday marks the end of the regular season — a season that was filled with surprise and disappointment for teams across the league. Not every game comes with playoff implications, but there are a handful you should be keeping a close eye on. \nTo help you do just that, follow along with our watch guide, giving you a glimpse at every game on Sunday’s slate. USA TODAY Sports Jeff Hanisch Baltimore Ravens at Cincinnati Bengals, 1 p.m. CBS (Sunday Ticket channel 705) \nKey matchup: Steve Smith vs. Dre Kirkpatrick \nThis is “probably” going to be Smith’s last game of his career, so he says, and he figures to be a big factor in an otherwise meaningless game. expect him to put up big numbers against Kirkpatrick, who’s a good-sized corner with great length. \nFun fact: Joe Flacco is the first Ravens quarterback with more than 4,000 yards since Vinny Testaverde in 1996 Ron Elkman/Sports Imagery Getty Images Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m. CBS (706) \nKey matchup: Jalen Ramsey vs. T.Y. Hilton \nRamsey has had a great stretch of games and is playing as well as any cornerback in the league right now. He’s not an ideal matchup for the smaller, quicker Hilton, but if he continues to be a ball hawk, Luck and the offense will struggle. \nFun fact: Blake Bortles is one of three quarterbacks in Jaguars history with two seasons of 3,500 yards. New England Patriots at Miami Dolphins, 1 p.m. CBS (707) \nKey matchup: Matt Moore vs. Bill Belichick \nThis isn’t a direct matchup obviously, but Belichick has a history of exposing a team’s biggest weakness. For the Dolphins, Matt Moore is playing well, but he’ll have a hiccup against the Patriots’ top-ranked defense in terms of scoring. \nFun fact: The Patriots haven’t won in Miami since 2012. Rich Barnes Getty Images Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings, 1 p.m. FOX (711) \nKey matchup: Chicago’s secondary vs. Adam Thielen \nThielen has burst onto the scene this season, nearing 1,000 yards receiving. The combination of he and Stefon Diggs is a good one for Minnesota and one that the Bears could have trouble stopping. \nFun fact: Jordan Howard’s 1,178 yards rushing are the third most by a rookie in Bears history. Buffalo Bills at New York Jets, 1 p.m. CBS (708) \nKey matchup: Bills CBs vs. Jets' receivers \nStephon Gilmore is not expected to play, while Brandon Marshall is questionable. That leaves Ronald Darby and Quincy Enunwa as each teams' best options, respectively. \nFun fact: In his last start, EJ Manuel had 245 yards and two touchdowns. It came against the Jets. Getty Images Brett Carlsen Dallas Cowboys at Philadelphia Eagles, 1 p.m. FOX (712) \nKey matchup: Fletcher Cox vs. Zack Martin \nThe Cowboys are likely to rest starters this week, but for at least some of the game, Cox will line up against Martin. This is a matchup of dominant players who hardly ever lose one-on-one battles. \nFun fact: Dak Prescott needs one win to set the NFL record for wins by a rookie quarterback in one season. Cleveland Browns at Pittsburgh Steelers, 1 p.m. CBS (709) \nKey matchup: Terrelle Pryor vs. Artie Burns \nThe Steelers may opt to rest Burns and keep him fresh for the postseason, but he could use as much work as he can get. The impressive rookie will be a handful for Pryor, who’s been equally great this season. \nFun fact: The Browns have lost 12 straight at Heinz Field and 16 of their past 17. Carolina Panthers at Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 1 p.m. FOX (713) \nKey matchup: James Bradberry vs. Mike Evans \nBradberry has had a bit of a rough rookie year, and it won’t get any easier when Evans comes into his zone on Sunday. This is a matchup of big, physical players and it should be a fun one to watch. \nFun fact: Greg Olsen is the only TE in NFL history with three straight seasons of 1,000 yards. Jeremy Brevard Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports Houston Texans at Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m. CBS (710) \nKey matchup: Jadeveon Clowney vs. Titans’ tackles \nClowney has become (close to) the player everyone expected him to be. He’s had a great 2016 season and is a big reason the Texans’ defense has played well in J.J. Watt’s absence. Taylor Lewan and Jack Conklin could give him fits on Sunday though. \nFun fact: DeAndre Hopkins has 50 catches and 800 yards in each of his first four seasons – a feat only eight other players in league history have done. New York Giants at Washington Redskins, 4:25 p.m. FOX (716) \nKey matchup: Odell Beckham Jr. vs. Josh Norman \nThis is the second-most meaningful game of the day, and it’s one that will be a hard-fought battle. Beckham and Norman obviously have a history and they’ll be sure to see plenty of each other on Sunday. \nFun fact: Sterling Shepard’s eight touchdown catches are tied for third-most by a rookie in Giants history. Getty Images Getty Images New Orleans Saints at Atlanta Falcons, 4:25 p.m. FOX (717) \nKey matchup: Saints tackles vs. Vic Beasley \nBeasley surprisingly leads the NFL in sacks, and you can bet he’ll do everything in his power to extend his cushion and finish the year No. 1. The Saints will need to keep Drew Brees upright if they want to have a shot in this one. \nFun fact: Michael Thomas leads all rookies with 82 catches and 981 yards, while he’s tied for first with eight touchdowns catches. ©Icon Sportswire (A Division of XML Team Solutions) All Rights Reserved contact: info@iconsportswire.com http://iconsportswire. Oakland Raiders at Denver Broncos, 4:25 p.m. CBS (714) \nKey matchup: Matt McGloin vs. Von Miller \nThe Broncos’ defense is outstanding, even without DeMarcus Ware. McGloin will get his first taste of what it’s like to face a Super Bowl-caliber D for an entire game, and it will give fans a glimpse of what they can expect in the playoffs. \nFun fact: Amari Cooper is just the ninth player in NFL history to start his career with two straight seasons of 1,000 yards. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP Arizona Cardinals at Los Angeles Rams, 4:25 p.m. FOX (718) \nKey matchup: David Johnson vs. Rams’ defense \nJohnson should be an MVP candidate, and he would be one if the Cardinals weren’t a massive disappointment. He’ll face the tough Rams defense, which boasts Aaron Donald in the middle. \nFun fact: The all-time series is tied 37-37-2. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP Kansas City Chiefs at San Diego Chargers, 4:25 p.m. CBS (715) \nKey matchup: Eric Berry vs. Antonio Gates and Hunter Henry \nThe Chargers have a nice duo in Gates and Henry, but Berry is playing like the best safety in football. He can take away Rivers’ favorite targets in the middle of the field. \nFun fact: Dontari Poe is the only DT in NFL history with a touchdown pass and a rushing touchdown in his career. USA TODAY Sports Troy Taormina Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers, 4:25 p.m. FOX (719) \nKey matchup: Carlos Hyde vs. Seattle’s run defense \nHyde has been one of the few bright spots of the season, rushing for 988 yards and six touchdowns. He needs just 12 yards to reach 1,000 for the first time in his career, but the Seahawks won’t make it easy. \nFun fact: Thomas Rawls had a career-high 209 yards against the 49ers in 2015. Green Bay Packers at Detroit Lions, 8:30 p.m. NBC \nKey matchup: Jordy Nelson vs. Darius Slay \nSlay should make is return on Sunday after missing the past two games, and the Lions will need him. They’re arguably the worst pass defense in the league, allowing the highest completion percentage and passer rating. \nFun fact: Aaron Rodgers is 12-3 in his career against the Lions, including 5-2 on the road. He has a passer rating of 108.0 in those 15 games.
