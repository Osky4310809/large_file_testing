They wanted to compete with the Super Bowl, so they held a preaching “competition” that included ass-slapping, a crotch joke, sexual innuendo masquerading as humor, and one of the pastors wondering out loud why so many people want nothing to do with evangelicals. \nThe full service is right here , in case you need proof that this video is real. \nHey, pastor: This video is just one of many, many answers to your question. \nAlso, this is a really weird way to tell everyone gay people don’t deserve equal rights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:49:13.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
