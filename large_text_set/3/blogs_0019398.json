It’s a beautiful gold “colour” with a delicate “lustre,” too.)\nOkay, this is bizarre for several reasons. First of all…what the what??? Secondly, Groupon makes nail polish !? And you can taste it?!?!!?\nThis might not be an ideal product for those struggling with nail nibbling or cuticle gnawing. Theoretically, it’ll make your digits more irresistible. It definitely brings new meaning to the concept of “finger food.” \nGroupon UK Hey, it’s a conversation starter! The gold is very pretty and festive, and since it’s only available in the UK and through a contest, you’ll definitely be among the lucky few to have this bubbly bottle of polish.\nWhether or not you have a strange addiction, Groupon discourages drinking the polish. Once it’s dry you can be a lacquer licker, if you dare. It’s perfect for nailing your perfect Instagram “ finger mouthing ” pose. Sexy!\nThe formula contains a few ingredients that don’t sound terribly appetizing, including Shellac E904, E171 Titanium Dioxide, and Propylene Glycol. Cosmetic chemist (cool job alert) Ginger King told Allure , “Propylene glycol is an antifreeze for cars.” (We’re not sure if it’s vegan.)\nCheers! Prosecco Polish contains real prosecco, so if you’re on the wagon, you might opt for the LaCroix version. (That’s not a thing yet, but can it please be???) Errbody in the nail salon get tipsy!\nThe Groupon Prosecco Polish is currently only available in the UK via sweepstakes, enter to win at Groupon UK !\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:35:55.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
