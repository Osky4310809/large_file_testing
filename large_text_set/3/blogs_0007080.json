Carneys Point Police Sgt. Joe Johnson said speed appears to be a factor. \n“Just based on the damage to the house and the damage to the vehicle,” he said. \nJohnson said a Penns Grove officer was trying to pull the car over, but the driver wouldn’t stop. After crashing into the house, the man reportedly ran off, leaving four people in the car. \nMedics took the front passenger to Salem Hospital, after she hit her head on the windshield. The others refused treatment. \nNewmuis said the whole situation was completely avoidable. \n“There’s no need to run, just pull over. They’re lucky they didn’t get killed,” he said.
