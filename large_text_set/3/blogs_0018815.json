The update itself is slim, with one one major bullet point to talk about: the ability to rent something from the iTunes Store, and then watch that content on any one of your devices, as long as that device is tied to your Apple ID that rented the content. \nThe requirements: iTunes 12.6, and then devices running iOS 10.3, or an Apple TV running tvOS 10.2. Unfortunately both iOS 10.3 and tvOS 10.2 are currently in beta seeds, so this update to iTunes is setting the stage for new features in those software releases. It’s likely that Apple is planning on releasing the newest updates for iOS and tvOS soon, though. \nThe update to iTunes is rolling out now, so keep an eye out for it.
