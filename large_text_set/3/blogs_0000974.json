Most are in the U.S. but 4,336 are in Canada. \nThe air bags were made by Japanese supplier Takata Corp., but they don’t have the same deadly problem that has led to a recall of millions of Takata air bags. \nIn that case, air bags can inflate with too much force and spew shrapnel at occupants. \nIn Ford’s case, the air bags may not fill completely because of misaligned components. \nFord said it is not aware of any accidents or injuries associated with the defect. Takata notified Ford after it discovered some production problems. \nFord will begin notifying customers the week of March 13. Dealers will replace affected air bags for free once parts are available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:22:45.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
