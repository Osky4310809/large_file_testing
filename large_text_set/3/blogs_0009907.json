Located west of Figueroa and north of York, the tree-lined cul-de-sac has already been the recipient of Highland Park Heritage’s Community Preservation award for its bounty of well-kept Craftsman bungalows, such as this lovely specimen that just joined the market. \nBuilt in 1910, the cottage last sold six years ago to photographer Lauren Dukoff and her husband, who restored the four-bedroom, one-bath home to pristine condition after decades of damage and neglect. \nMeasuring 1,371 square feet, the centerfold-ready residence features original oak floors, box beam ceilings, Douglas fir built-ins and paneling, picture windows, a clawfoot tub, and brick fireplace.\nThough the kitchen has been updated, it’s got a sweet retro vibe, with restored vintage stove, farmhouse sink, and copious shelving. Other modern elements include a tankless water heater, central heat/AC, and a finished studio converted from a two-car garage. \nThe picturesque property occupies a 10,249-square-foot lot with a dreamy, rambling garden that’s been designated a certified wildlife habitat. Asking price is $859,000, and open house is scheduled from 1 and 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.\n5947 Great Oak Circle [The L34 Group] 5947 Great Oak Cir [Estately] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:47:17.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
