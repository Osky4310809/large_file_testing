At first we were skeptical when Nintendo promised 60 indie games for the system in 2017, but it looks the company means (independent) business.\nCheck it out!\nThere are so many announcements so quickly it’s hard to keep up. So here’s just a fat, but still incomplete, list of 2017 Switch indie games. Some are even exclusives, timed exclusives, console exclusives, or support exclusive Switch features like HD Rumble.\nSteamworld Dig 2 (Summer) Shovel Knight: Spectre of Torment/Treasure Trove (March 3) Fast RMX (March 3) Has-Been Heroes (March) Yooka-Laylee Overcooked! Tumbleseed (Spring) The Escapists 2 Ultimate Chicken Horse Redout Gonner Dandara Kingdom Two Crowns Runner 3 Blaster Master Zero (March 9) Flipping Death Graceful Explosion Machine (April) Mr. Shifty (April) Shakedown Hawaii ((April) Pocket Rumble (March) Wargroove Stardew Valley with multiplayer (Summer) Snake Pass (March 29) Binding of Isaac (March) Hollow Knight Battle Chef Brigade Celeste Jackbox Party Pack 3 Rime (May) Mutant Mudds Ittle Dew 2 1001 Spikes Human resource Machine (March 3) World of Goo (March 3) Little Inferno (March 3) Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap Cave Story Towerfall Ascension ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove Enter the Gungeon Duck Game Oceanhorn Terraria \nWow that’s a lot of games, a lot of games to thankfully pad out the Switch’s shifting, limited launch lineup and current lack of Virtual Console. While some are roguelikes others are Game of the Year contenders. Nintendo promises weekly eShop “Nindie” releases. Last year Nintendo made it much easier for indie developers to work with its platforms. While we did see some prominent indie games come to Wii U, the Switch looks like it will be absolutely stuffed with quality indie games thanks to this initiative.\nUntil now, handheld indie games were enough to keep some folks interested in the PlayStation Vita despite its lack of support from Sony. Take all of those games and add first party Nintendo hits like Mario , Zelda , Pokemon , and Smash Bros. , and suddenly the Switch sounds that much more appealing. It may not get every huge Western AAA game like Mass Effect or Red Dead , and not everyone may care about every indie game, but looking at this list, anyone who says the Nintendo Switch is getting no games just isn’t paying attention.\nWant to learn more?
