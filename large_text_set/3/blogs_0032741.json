Almost didn't go down like that at all... \nIn a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly , Del Vecho explained that Elsa was originally conceived as an ice queen who froze her own heart after her fiancé left her at the altar (rude!). Anna, on the other hand, was the young protagonist with a heart of gold, so her story line didn't change much — except for the fact that in this version, she and Elsa weren’t even related at all! \nIn addition to Elsa being a straight-up villain and not being related to Anna, the ending of that draft of the story was also completely different. Instead of escaping to be alone with her powers, Elsa enlisted an army of \"snow monsters\" to attack the movie’s protagonists. Hans, AKA the evil prince who tricks Anna into falling in love with him, triggers an avalanche to stop Elsa, and is totally fine with killing all of the innocent villagers of Arendelle in the process. Hans is then revealed to be the “ruler with a frozen heart” from a prophecy that's mentioned earlier in the story (that was assumed to be Elsa), but Anna convinces Elsa to use her icy powers to save the kingdom. She does, her heart unfreezes, and this leads her to finally being able to love again, etc., etc. The end. \nWow. That’s not just a completely different ending — that’s a whole different movie. Del Vecho explained the very good reason Disney decided to nix the original plot, telling EW, “We had no emotional connection to Elsa [in the original version]— we didn’t care about her because she had spent the whole movie being the villain.” Thus, the creatives behind the film decided the movie should be about love versus fear, instead of the classic good versus evil trope. Del Vecho explained of the plot change, “Making them related led us to the idea of [Elsa] living in fear of her powers... What if she’s afraid of who she is? And afraid of hurting the ones she loves? Now we had a character in Anna who was all about love and Elsa who was all about fear\". \n*Insert canned \"Let it Go\" joke here* \nWhat do you think of the OG Frozen plot?
