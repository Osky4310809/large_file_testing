Van Damme with his thick accent and incredible physique was perceived by some as being the poor-man’s Arnold Schwarzenegger, while Lundgren with his droning voice and menacing look more often than not ended up playing villains, most notably opposite Sylvester Stallone in the unforgettable Rocky IV .\nVan Damme and Lundgren did get a couple chances to shine together, when they starred in the hard-core military action flick Universal Soldier and its unfortunate sequel Universal Soldier: Regeneration . Now the two action movie icons are getting another chance to share the screen, and this time they will reportedly be playing allies instead of enemies.\nAccording to THR , Van Damme (who recently appeared in Kickboxer Vengeance ) and Lundgren ( who appeared on Arrow last year ) have signed on to appear in Dawn’s Light Media’s action/thriller Black Water . Van Damme will reportedly play an operative who finds himself imprisoned by the CIA on a submarine (hence the title Black Water ). There’s no word yet on Lundgren’s character but since he’s supposed to be a friend of Van Damme’s, we can only assume he’s not one of the guys who locked Van Damme up on a sub.\nBlack Water doesn’t have a director as of yet, but the script is by Chad Law, a writer who has scripted more than his fair share of action movies; including the Van Damme vehicle 6 Bullets and the Cuba Gooding Jr. flicks Hero Wanted and The Hit List . Law may only specialize in B-movie material, but he is a pretty prolific writer, so you know he knows his way around an action plot. Not that fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren care all that much about plot. The website The Action Elite shared a poster image from Black Water and claimed some filming was going to take place near Mobile, Alabama.\nThe few details we’ve learned about Black Water can only cause us to speculate on what the movie will finally be about. Hopefully Jean-Claude will get a chance to break out of his submarine prison and beat the crap out of some bad guys while doing the splits. Let’s also hope Chad Law has written some amusing banter for Van Damme and Lundgren.\nThe original Van Damme/Lundgren pairing Universal Soldier , which came out all the way back in 1992, was not exactly a movie masterpiece but it was a pretty entertaining action flick for its day. Both Van Damme and Lundgren still have their fans out there and they should be happy to see the ’80s icons re-teaming for one more go-around, this time as buddies instead of adversaries.\nWe’ll bring you more details on Black Water as they become available.\nSource: THR", "external_links": ["http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/dolph-lundgren-deadpool-2-cable.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1179&h=590&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/dolph-lundgren-deadpool-2-cable.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=730&h=365&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/dolph-lundgren-deadpool-2-cable.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=570&h=285&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/dolph-lundgren-deadpool-2-cable.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=945&h=473&fit=crop", "http://theactionelite.com/2016/12/jcvd-dolph-lundgren-are-in-black-water/", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/dolph-lundgren-deadpool-2-cable.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1417&h=709&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/dolph-lundgren-deadpool-2-cable.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=380&h=190&fit=crop", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/dolph-lundgren-deadpool-2-cable.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=1095&h=548&fit=crop", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jean-claude-van-damme-dolph-lundgren-team-action-thriller-black-water-960784?utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral", "http://screenrant0.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/dolph-lundgren-deadpool-2-cable.jpg?auto=format&lossless=1&q=40&w=786&h=393&fit=crop"], "published": "2017-01-04T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:28:40.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
