It is N’Diaye, however, who finds space down the right, forcing Koscielny into conceding a corner... 5' Arsenal have won seven of their last eight Premier League meetings with Hull, since losing their first such game against the Tigers back in September 2008. However, if they are to continue that run today, it will have to be without the influence - from the touchline at least - of Wenger, who is serving the last of his four-game pitch-side ban, and is watching on from the stands. 3' A really quick start from both sides here. First, Grosicki powers forward at pace, only to be halted by Koscielny. Arsenal work it forward through Iwobi, and though his cross is a poor one, Sanchez latches onto the loose ball, but Markovic gets back to clear. 1' KICK-OFF! We are underway at the Emirates, with Hull - donning their black and orange away strip - kicking-off proceedings. The teams are in the tunnel now at the Emirates, with just moments to go until the day’s Premier League action gets up and running... Meanwhile, Silva makes just two changes to his Hull line-up, as fresh from his maiden Premier league strike, Oumar Niasse replaces the injured Abel Hernandez, while Lazar Markovic starts in place of Evandro. Just the one change from Wenger then, who also has a spate of injuries to contend with, though Hector Bellerin has recovered from the head-knock that he sustained at Stamford Bridge last weekend. Kieran Gibbs comes in for his first league start of 2017, replacing Nacho Monreal. TEAM NEWS - Hull substitutes: Meyler, Maloney, Diomande, Marshall, Elmohamady, Tymon, Evandro. TEAM NEWS - Hull (4-2-3-1): Jakupovic; Elabdellaoui, Ranocchia, Maguire, Robertson; Huddlestone, N’Diaye; Markovic, Clucas, Grosicki; Niasse. TEAM NEWS - Arsenal substitutes: Gabriel, Lucas Perez, Giroud, Ospina, Monreal, Welbeck, Elneny. TEAM NEWS - Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Cech; Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Gibbs; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Coquelin; Walcott, Ozil, Iwobi; Sanchez. The team news is in now from a frosty Emirates Stadium. Let’s check on the line-ups, starting off with the hosts… And with last week’s victory over Liverpool under their belts, the visitors will be confident that they can cause another upset today, against an Arsenal side still reeling from their 3-1 thumping at the hands of runaway league leaders Chelsea last time-out. On the other hand, Hull seem to have been revitalised since Marco Silva took over at the KCOM Stadium. The Tigers are still planted in the relegation zone, though a victory today would lift them up into 15th - temporarily at least. However, the form guide suggests otherwise, with Arsene Wenger’s men having lost their last two Premier League fixtures. On paper, this fixture represents the ideal opportunity for Arsenal to consolidate their top-four place ahead of Liverpool’s mammoth clash with Tottenham later on today. Hello and welcome, football fans, to our LIVE coverage of Saturday’s early Premier League action. It’s a huge game for both ends of the table, as Arsenal take on relegation-battling Hull City.
