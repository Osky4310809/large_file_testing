The graphics can hardly be described as blatant copies (unlike the ones released by H&M, see below) but the inspiration is clear.\nJust got a letter back from @hm's lawyers. Here's an excerpt from their response. FUCK OFF H&M 🖕🏾 Respect the original 🔥 \nA post shared by THRASHER MAGAZINE (@thrashermag) on Feb 16, 2017 at 2:45pm PST \n\nBAPE’s “Flame Tee” collection drops this Saturday, March 25 at BAPE locations and online . Each tee is priced at ¥6,800 JPY (approximately $61).\nPlagiarism isn’t the only thing getting Thrasher ‘s back up — earlier this year, the magazine’s editor-in-chief, Jake Phelps, took umbrage with Justin Bieber and Rihanna wearing its clothing .\nIf you just can’t get enough of Thrasher -inspired clothing, check out this drug-fueled brand putting Mexico City on the streetwear map.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T13:06:01.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
