Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said he believes the intelligence collections were done legally, but he is concerned because they were apparently not related to the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the presidential election and because they were \"widely disseminated\" across the intelligence community. \nNunes would not confirm if President Trump's own communications were specifically monitored, saying only that it was \"possible\" that the president's communications were picked up. \n  said there are three distinct charges at play here:   possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump's claim that he was \"wiretapped\" by the Obama administration during the campaign, and Nunes' allegation that there may have been improper use of the information picked up legally and incidentally. Read Full Article \n\"The Nunes charge ... is that it was widespread and systematic,\" Krauthammer. \"That is what he says. We need to see the evidence.\" \nHe said the big question is if intelligence agents used legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on Trump and his associates. \n\"That would be a pretty big violation of what you're supposed to do,\" Krauthammer said. \"Was there an intent to abuse the listening in on the foreigners as a way to get inside and improperly listen to Americans?\" \nLet us know what you think in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:24:07.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
