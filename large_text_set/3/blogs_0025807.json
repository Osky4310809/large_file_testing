The story in question said police were looking into a select few incidents. \nPerhaps more concerning was Mr Trump continuing to insist that 3 million people had voted illegally in the 2016 election. \nSuggesting that the number could be even higher, he said many of people registered “incorrectly, and/or illegally,” but he did not specify what registering “incorrectly” means. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 \nCalling himself an “instinctual person,” Mr Trump boasted about predicting his own electoral victory. He went as far as to claim he and his team “thought we were going to win the night of the election.\" \nBut a week after the vote Mr Trump told supporters in Wisconsin that he “really assumed I lost” on election night. \n“I got a call from my daughter at about 5 o’clock, and she was called by people in their business,” he told the crowd that night. “And her husband, Jared, great guy, he was called. Then they called me and they said: ‘I’m sorry, Dad. It looks really bad. Looks really, really bad.’” \nThe President also contradicted himself when discussing his statements on Sweden. \nAt a campaign rally in February, Mr Trump made a passing reference to “what happened Friday night in Sweden.” \nIt was later revealed that nothing had happened that night in Sweden and the US leader was widely mocked by some of the country's citizens on social media. \nMr Trump later claimed that he had been referencing a Fox News report about the country that had aired the night before his speech. \nIn the Time interview, however, Mr Trump claimed he was talking about the situation in Sweden general. \n“I’m talking about what Sweden has done to themselves is very sad, that is what I am talking about,” he told the magazine. “That is what I am talking about. You can phrase it any way you want.” My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017 \nThroughout the interview, Mr Trump returned to his controversial claim that Barack Obama had ordered a wiretaps be placed in Trump Tower in the lead up to the presidential election. \nCiting House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes’ claim that Mr Trump had been subject to “incidental surveillance,” the President said his accusations were “right.” \nAsked about Trump’s wiretapping allegations later, however, Mr Nunes responded: \"That never happened.\" \nTo back up his claim, Mr Trump cited a New York Times article on alleged surveillance. That story, “Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides,\" said the FBI had intercepted some calls from Trump associates. It never mentioned any kind of surveillance — much less wiretapping — of Mr Trump himself. \nIn a final pitch to showcase his “great instincts\", Mr Trump predicted he would once again grace the cover of Time magazine after the interview. \nBut i nstead, against a black backdrop, it bears the simple question: “Is truth dead?” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T20:45:14.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
