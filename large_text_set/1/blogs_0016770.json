Newcastle are monitoring Townsend's situation (Photo: Ian Walton) \nAllardyce was hoping that Townsend would be a big hit under his management but his form has been a big concern. \nPalace have already signed Jeffrey Schlupp from Leicester for £12m and he is expected to play on the left wing rather than at left back. \nThat has raised questions on Townsend’s future and Allardyce could be ready to cash in with Newcastle set to make a move given any encouragement. \nPalace, who are hoping to complete a £6m deal for Arsenal’s Carl Jenkinson, are also interested in Juventus’s former Manchester United left back Patrice Evra, 35. Big Sam is looking at defensive reinforcements (Photo: Getty) \nThere is likely to be more comings and goings at Palace before the end of the window and Townsend knows he could be on the move. \nNewcastle boss Rafa Benitez has not denied that Townsend could be a target but it will depend on whether Palace decide to sell. \nTownsend only had six months at Newcastle but clearly did enough in that short spell to impress and make them interested in a return. poll loading Did Andros Townsend make a mistake leaving Newcastle? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T18:42:15.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
