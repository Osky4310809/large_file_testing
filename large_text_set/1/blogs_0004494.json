Madison's arm after it had filled with lymphatic fluid (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nShe also has to wear compression garments 24-hours a day and has the fluid drained twice a day. \nOver time it is hoped treatment will reduce the swelling to a size where surgeons will be able to operate - until then her mum has learned to treat her at home. \nJoni said: \"Due to her condition she needs to wear custom compression garments 24/7 and also has to take oral medication to reduce the lymphatic fluid production in her body. \n\"I give her lymphatic massages, then we do the compression garments and have started therapy where fluid is pulled out mixed with saline and injected back into her system.

What is CLOVES? \nCLOVES stands for congential, lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal nevi and spinal/skeletal/seizures. \nKristen Davis, executive director of CLOVES Syndrome Community, said: \"CLOVES is caused by non-hereditary somatic mutation - the affected gene that causes CLOVES is called PIK3ca, a mutation that is often implicated in aggressive cancers. \n\"Overgrowth related to CLOVES can occur anywhere in the body including brain, trunk, limbs including hands and feet, as well as internal soft tissue tumors and vascular malformations. \n\"Some people have overgrowth in many parts of the body, some only have a few parts of the body affected. \n\"The problems that each person has, depends on where the overgrowth is located.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T12:32:50.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
