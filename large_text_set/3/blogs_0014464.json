Daily Sabah and Anadolu confirmed the news of the manager's intentions. \"I am leaving the club by the end of the season,\" Advocaat said. \"I don't see any harm announcing my decision. If I had not, the management would have done it anyway.\" Advocaat has been one of the most revered coaches of his generation, managing at the top level for decades. The Dutchman was in charge of the Netherlands before successful spells with PSV Eindhoven and Glasgow Rangers. The Dutch boss also had stints as manager of South Korea, Belgium and Russia, as well as head coaching positions at Borussia Monchengladbach, Zenit Saint Petersburg and Sunderland. Advocaat has often been an outspoken individual, speaking his mind to the press in a frank and direct manner. In February, the 69-year-old veteran criticised his own team after their victory against Krasnodar of Russia in the UEFA Europa League, per Daily Sabah. \"Krasnodar deserved to advance. [Fyodor] Smolov is not a superstar, if he were a star he would not play in Krasnodar or Fenerbah√ße,\" said Advocaat. The coach exits the game with his team suffering a disappointing period in the Turkish Super Lig. Fener are currently in fourth place, 10 points behind leaders Besiktas, as the Istanbul club struggle for their best form.
