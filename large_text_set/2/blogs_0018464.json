By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 22, 2017 1:41 PM Union Minister Uma Bharti has said that the BJP, if voted to power after March 11, will start the process of making Bundelkhand a separate state. \nUnion Minister Uma Bharti has said that the BJP , if voted to power after March 11, will start the process of making Bundelkhand a separate state. Voting will be held in the region during the fourth phase of polling for Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections on February 23. BJP, led by its star campaigner Prime Minister Narendra Modi , has left no stone unturned to gain electoral supremacy in Bundelkhand, which is considered as the stronghold of Mayawati’s BSP. Lashing out at Chief Akhilesh Yadav and the ruling Samajwadi Party for the ‘fragile’ state of Bundelkhand, Bharti claimed the region features among three of poorest areas of India. The Union Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, has also said that the Narendra Modi government had allocated Rs 3,630 crore for the region. Accusing the state government of mismanaging the fund, she claimed, “while 40 per cent of the fund has been spent, rest 60 per cent was wasted due to corruption.” \nBundelkhand has always backed BSP. It was here that BSP founder Kanshi Ram had successfully stitched his “pachasi versus pandrah” formula, seeking to consolidate the “85 per cent” — Dalits, backward castes, Muslims — against the “15 per cent” comprising upper castes. \nWatch this video \nCurtains came down on high voltage campaigning for the fourth phase of polling for Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017, which was marked by offensive personal jibes. 53 Assembly constituencies spread over 12 districts will go to polls. \nUnion Minister Uma Bharti had earlier said the Congress -SP alliance will soon sink as Mulayam Singh Yadav had already punched a hole in it, and the rest will be done by the BJP wave in Uttar Pradesh. “During its rule, the SP government has encouraged corruption and crime in the state, and just before the elections Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav sought Congress vice president Rahul Gandhis help to counter the BJP wave,” she claimed at a rally here. The Minister had said, “The Chief Ministers father Mulayam Singh Yadav had already punched a hole in the alliance and it will be soon sunk by the BJP wave in Uttar Pradesh.” \nTaking a swipe at Rahul, she said, “The prince (Rahul) thinks he has the right to become the Prime Minister just because his father (Rajiv Gandhi) and grandmother (Indira Gandhi) had held the post. He cannot digest the fact that the people have chosen a tea-seller, Narendra Modi, as their Prime Minister.” Bharti alleged that the Congress has always worked towards dividing the country on religion and multiple scams have marked its rule. “Now, the Prime Ministers raincoat remarks on his predecessor Manmohan Singh has angered the Congress and they have used unparliamentary language,” she said. \nShe also alleged that the Centres Namami Gange Project could not pick pace in the state has the current dispensation had not granted no-objection certificate (NOC) and posed hurdles to the rivers cleaning project. \nOn rivals demanding the BJP to announce its chief ministerial candidate, she said, “The party has no shortage of faces. It will declare a name when the time is right.” Not mentioning much about Mayawati in her address, the BJP leader claimed that the BSP and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee were most affected by the Centres demonetisation decision. \nThe Union Minister said, “If the BJP is voted to power it will improve the states law and order within 15 days through the same officers whom SP leaders have turned into their puppets.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:04:07.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
