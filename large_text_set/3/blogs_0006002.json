The comedian from Staten Island is one Saturday Night Live ‘s brilliant bright spots, joining that show in 2014 at the age of 20. But his absence from the show over the last couple weeks has been noted by the culture at large, along with a pattern of behavior on his social accounts. After years of activity, he deleted his @petedavidson Twitter account a while ago and entirely scrubbed his Instagram account, where he once penned a hilarious, poignant tribute to his father — an FDNY firefighter — who died as a first responder in 9/11.\nDavidson has spoken openly about his struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts. This past fall he credited Kid Cudi for saving his life on The Breakfast Club : \n“Cudi’s the best of all,” He saved my life. I would’ve killed myself if I didn’t have Kid Cudi,” Davidson said. “I would’ve killed myself. Absolutely 100 percent. I truly believe if ‘Man on the Moon’ didn’t come out, I wouldn’t be here.”\n“I’ve been in and out of things like that, and I think that’s why a lot of kids my age can relate to Cudi and people love him so much,” Davidson said. “He’s a very emotional dude and he saves all of us. That’s very real and honest and it’s comforting to know that your hero goes through the same stuff you do.”\nToday reactivated his Instagram and explained what’s going on:\nJust wanted to let you guys know I’m okay. I know I’ve kinda been missing, on social media and on the show. I quit drugs and am happy and sober for the first time in 8 years. It wasn’t easy, but I got a great girl, great friends and I consider myself a lucky man. I’ll always be here for you guys, I promise. Remember to never give up hope because sometimes that’s all we got. We are a family and I appreciate all your love and support. It’s nice to be back in action ❤️\n\nHell yea, Pete. Slay those demons and get back on that horse, cowboy. And the girl, by the way, is Cazzie David , the daughter of Curb Your Enthusiasm creator Larry David.\nCouldn’t pick one so I went with two. Luckiest guy in the world #babygirl \n \n\n\n \nAnd if you follow Cazzie on Instagram , you can tell the couple is very, very happy together:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:50:29.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
