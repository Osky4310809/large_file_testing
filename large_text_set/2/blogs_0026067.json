See what we did there.\nThe Vampire Diaries star’s edgy look is a far cry from her past long, straight styles. Nina is clearly getting a kick out of her lob — she fluffed the new cut several times on the carpet while posing for photogs.\nHairstylist Riawna Capri took Nina’s hair to the next level. (She revealed her lob secrets after Nina first chopped it all off.) Nina couldn’t keep her hands off her locks, and we don’t blame her! Few things beat the feeling of a fresh new haircut that you love.\nNina’s hairstylist, Riawna Capri, broke down the ‘do:\n“Nina loves her short hair but wanted it even shorter! Before beginning her styling, I took the length up even more. I cut her hair using texturizing techniques but also maintaining a strong, blunt perimeter.” We know that feeling, Nina! Alberto E. Rodriguez / WireImage This look is enviable but attainable. The mid-length cut hits just below the chin and can be flattering on a variety of hair types and face shapes. We love a good lob for its wearable versatility, and the countless ways it can be styled.\nIt looks like Nina’s hairstylist agrees with us on this fun, spring ready hairdo, saying:\n“Nina looks amazing with short hair. I loved her first haircut, but I love this one even more! She looks great!” Yass Nina, look back at it. (Oooh, and that choker!) C Flanigan / Getty Images Her shade is slightly lighter and warmer than it’s been recently. A deep side part creates an asymmetrical effect. Nina’s warm-toned skin glowed, and a heavy black eyeliner brought out the actress’ brown eyes.\nOh, just casually hanging out at this Oscar party. C Flanigan / Getty Images Nina wore a lingerie-inspired Dior dress…ooh-la-la. Alberto E. Rodriguez / WireImage Not mad at the silver nails and boxy clutch combo, either! C Flanigan / Getty Images \nThis style is definitely a keeper, but we can’t wait to see where Nina’s hair evolution takes her next!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:32:49.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
