The only thing there was a hollow but we have been able to work on that,” he said. \nHe said that cough was dangerous for cleft lip operation and must be treated first before such operation could be embarked upon. \nThe surgeon, who expressed satisfaction after the successful operation, said that no fewer than 21 of the 51 people operated upon in January, reported back to the hospital for a follow-up. \nBello said that the operation was 100 per cent successful, as there was no relapse from the patients operated. \nHe said the condition was in four categories; cleft lip is either unilateral or bilateral, tumour, lock jaw and Noma. \n“Noma is more critical because this condition eats up the nose and the lip. It is a rapidly-progressive, polymicrobial, often gangrenous infection of the mouth or genitals,’’ he said. \nBello advised parents and the general public, who have children or wards living with maxillofacial condition, not to feel stigmatised but to go for surgery in a hospital. \n“The people who have this condition should not seek solution from a native doctor but seek solution from orthodox. \n“Health problems are solved in the hospital; people are better informed in the hospital. \n“The idea of consulting an oracle to solve a medical problem is absurd, and should not be. It is in the hospital that medical problems are solved. \n“People get informed advice from the hospital. People should not always base their problem on spiritual and seek the service of witch-doctor that will complicate issues for them,’’ the medical expert said. \nMalam Suleiman Ciroma, a parent of one of the patients, expressed gratitude to the Foundation for the free surgery. \nMr John Tanko, a parent, was grateful to God for using the Foundation to assuage his pain. \nNewsmen report that six children had a successful cleft lip surgery, while one Noma patient had her nose reconstructed, as the ailment had eaten up her nose region.
