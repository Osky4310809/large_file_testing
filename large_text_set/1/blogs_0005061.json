In 2015, he raced the car in both the April and August events at Bristol Motor Speedway, earning a finish of 16th in the spring race and ninth in the fall event.” \nThe custom Chevelle certainly sounds awesome as well, with a modern Chevy V-8 under the hood, a reproduction body in Black Diamond metallic paint, a modern coil-over suspension system, Camaro Track Pack 20″ racing wheels, Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires, four-wheel disc brakes and retrimmed 2012 Camaro seats. \n“Assembly of the Chevelle came together at GM’s Milford Proving Ground and started with an original ’70 Chevelle frame, but almost every other component used during the car’s construction is all-new, including the body,” states the auction listing. \nTypically, charity cars at Barrett-Jackson fetch huge sums of money, and while it’s impossible to predict what the Earnhardt-designed Chevelle and the No. 88 race car will bring, expect the final sale prices to be substantial. \nAnd more importantly, the sales are both for a great cause, which makes it win-win, no matter where the hammer prices end up. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T18:54:11.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
