But did you know there is a Jaclyn Hill Palette highlighter? Let us explain. In the 35-shade selection of shadows in the Jaclyn Hill x Morphe palette, the beauty vlogger snuck in a moony, luminous shade that doubles as a highlighter. Last night, Hill added videos of herself swatching it to her Snapchat Story. Us = shook. In her story, Hill says the highlighting shade isn't the same as Morphe's typical shimmers. Instead, the one in the Jaclyn Hill Palette has a completely different formula because she didn't want the neutral shade to look too oily or opaque. Which is not to say you should worry about intensity—the other metallic shades in the palette, from what we've seen , are insanely pigment packed. What this formulation tweak does mean is that there won't be a a ton of unwanted fall out when applying the secret highlighter onto brow bones. Hill also put a swatch of the white gold hue on her forearm and showed what it looked like in different light. At some angles, it kind of has a holographic finish. Even Hill was surprised at how the way it was coming up on her phone. It seems to pick up purples, greens, and blue depending on how the light hits it. Basically, we're sold—mostly because we're obsessed with purple highlighter right about now.
