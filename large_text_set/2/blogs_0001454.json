AP Photo/Susan Walsh\nPresident Donald Trump made a surprise, unannounced trip on Wednesday to honor the return of slain US Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens.\nOwens died during a raid on al Qaeda in Yemen, along with about 30 civilians and 14 members of al Qaeda. Three other Navy SEALs were wounded in the raid, and a $70 million MV-22 Osprey belonging to a Marine quick-reaction rescue force had to be destroyed .\nTrump issued a statement after the news of Owens' death expressing his sorrow and praising the bravery of the US service members who gathered \"important intelligence that will assist the US in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world.\"\nAfter the operation, Trump had a long phone call with Owens' family. Owens represents the first combat loss during Trump's presidency.\n\"You never want to call something a success 100% when someone is hurt or killed\" Whitehouse spokesperson Sean Spicer said of the raid in Yemen at a press conference on Wednesday.\nHowever, an unnamed official told NBC News that \"almost everything went wrong,\" with the raid. The official described the death of an 8-year-old girl, several other civilians, the burning of a house, and the intentional destruction of the Osprey.\nAccording to Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal , raids like the one in Yemen have been common under Obama and will likely continue under Trump.\nAn Osprey helicopter had to be destroyed during the raid on Yemen. US Air Force Photo\nRoggio told Business Insider that the US had taken out prominent al Qaeda figures in Yemen leading up to the raid, and that the al Qaeda branch in Yemen had indeed been plotting attacks on the US.\n\"This is a branch that's at the forefront of launching plots to blow up airlines and attack Americans. They have a bomb maker, Ibrahim al Asiri, who has designed some complicated bombs and directed attacks against the US,\" Roggio told Business Insider.\nDespite the death of Owens and the approximately 30 civilians, Roggio said the raid's success would ultimately be determined by the intelligence gained by the US as a result.\nRoggio said that the US monitors terrorists via drones and their online presences, but \"you can only get so much from that, and they know what theyâ€™re doing.\"\n\"If you really want to know what's on their hard drive, you have to confiscate it,\" said Roggio.\nSEE ALSO: An 8-year-old American girl was killed during the SEAL Team 6 raid in Yemen NOW WATCH: Why the US military's M1 Abrams tank is still the king of the battlefield Donald Trump Navy SEAL Military Defense Yemen Al Qaeda", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjIyZ_l4u_RAhVh2oMKHcuLDo4QqQIIGigAMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fadministration%2F317130-trump-speaks-with-family-of-slain-navy-seal&usg=AFQjCNHEdVBL-BzS9TPMWE7SNrq9wa-K-Q&bvm=bv.146073913,d.amc", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/01/31/how-trumps-first-counter-terror-operation-in-yemen-turned-into-chaos/?utm_term=.70611163e0e1", "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/seal-american-girl-die-first-trump-era-u-s-military-n714346", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-1", "http://www.longwarjournal.org/"], "published": "2017-02-01T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:08:50.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
