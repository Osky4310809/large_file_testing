I think what’s great about that scene and what that scene propels for the rest of the movie is, ‘That’s OK.’ The movie is saying, ‘That’s OK,’ and all of the kids have to own who they are and find their tribe.”\nThere are superheros who have represented the LGBTQ community, but it’s never been translated to the big screen.\nAnother character in a major motion picture released this month – Beauty and The Beast – also features a gay character .\nPower Rangers will be released this Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:29:55.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
