Jericho Nograles after grilling Busan Universal Rail Inc. in last week's congressional hearing. “BURI has not delivered most of its primary commitments despite a whopping P3.81-billion service contract for three years,“ he said later in an official release. “For that, past and present officials of the Dept. of Transportation and the MRT-3 could be charged with plunder.” \nNograles, of Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta, threw a series of questions to BURI and DOTr reps during the hearing. BURI reps, he said, practically admitted “they did not have the right equipment and spare parts to conduct critical maintenance to ensure the safety and efficiency of MRT-3.” \nNograles said BURI was evasive, giving him the impression of “trying to cover up its incompetence.” At one point the company kept denying his assertion that it had subcontracted a small-time machine shop in Bulacan to conduct truing of 16 metal train wheels. Truing, or restoring to circular the worn-out metal, should be done using the wheel lathe machine, as prescribed in the contract. Only when Nograles showed a copy of the Bulacan shop's delivery receipt did BURI admit to not having the multimillion-peso equipment that was a prerequisite to qualify for the contracting in 2015. \n“They lied when I confronted them about this outsourcing of truing of the MRT-3's rail wheels,” Nograles said. “At first they claimed to be doing the work themselves, and did not subcontract any machine shop in Bulacan. But when I showed them the delivery receipt, they suddenly remembered. Halatang niloloko tayo ng mga ito (It's obvious they're pulling our leg).” \nPeriodic wheel truing is necessary for safe and smooth rides. Each of MRT-3's 72 coaches has 16 wheels. There is record of truing of only 16 wheels, or good for one coach. Whether the 71 other coaches have been trued is yet unclear. \nNograles said that BURI should have been disqualified outright by past transport and MRT-3 officials for lacking the prescribed maintenance tools. BURI was contracted in 2015 by then-secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya and then-general manager Roman Buenafe. Its contract is for three years, starting January 2016.

We will pay them P3.81 billion with their saliva as their only capital?” Nograles said. \nApart from being ill-equipped, BURI has not begun to overhaul 43 of the rundown coaches as stated in the contract, Nograles said. \nAnother unfulfilled contract stipulation is the upgrading of the signaling on the 72 old coaches from the Czech Republic and the 48 new ones from China. The latter 48 remain inoperable for incompatibility with the system, said Nograles who, with House transport committee chairman Cesar Sarmiento (Catanduanes) has been leading the charge against sloppy commuter train upkeep. \n“This maintenance contract and the purchase of incompatible MRT-3 coaches could lead to the indictment of several officials,” Nograles said. * * * \nThe Philippine Navy (PN) is now officially recognized as one of the world's best institutions in strategy execution, with its inclusion this month in the Palladium Balanced Scorecard Hall of Fame. \nThe Palladium is a global recognition of public and private organizations that ably meet their objective using a Harvard-developed measure, and in so doing improve society and environment. \nAmong the earlier international inductees to the Palladium are the United States Army and Federal Bureau of Investigation, British Ministry of Defense, United Arab Emirates Ministry of Interior, Portuguese Navy, and the City of Barcelona. Private firms like Canon and Seven-Eleven also have qualified. In the Philippines the Hall of Famers are San Fernando City, La Union; City of San Fernando, Pampanga; Iloilo City; and Balanga City, Bataan. The Philippine Navy is the country’s only national government agency so far awarded. \nRear Adm. Gaudencio Collado Jr, Chief of Naval Staff, received the award on behalf of the Navy during the Palladium Summit 2017 in London. Also there was Capt. Armil Angeles, Director of the Center for Naval Leadership and Excellence. \nThe recognition was given after the Navy showed compelling sustainable transformation and ingraining of good governance. It was measured by annual compliance with its own Strategic Sail Plan 2020, drafted five years ago by senior and junior officers. * * * \nTravelers to Hong Kong beware: There’s a new racket by crooked shopkeepers and cabbies. They’d pass off as change another country’s low-value currency that look so much like HK dollars. Recent Filipino tourists narrated to police handing HK$500 (worth P3,500) to a cabbie, who took it, went through the motions of counting smaller bills, then handed it back saying he didn’t have enough change. Only after they pooled enough fare and alighted did they notice that the cabbie had “returned” to them Peruvian money (worth P15.25). * * * \nCatch Sapol radio show, Saturdays, 8-10 a.m., DWIZ (882-AM). \nGotcha archives on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jarius-Bondoc/1376602159218459 , or The STAR website http://www.philstar.com/author/Jarius%20Bondoc/GOTCHA Opinion ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:38:45.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
