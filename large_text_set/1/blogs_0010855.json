He ultimately chose the restaurant industry over theater, opening his first restaurant, Pinto, on Christopher Street in 2006. \n\"I like to imagine I’m the director looking into the culinary world to create a show,\" said Nanthavatsiri. \"Chefs, like actors, have to train for their roles. Every day is a rehearsal and when it’s time for dinner service, it’s my time to perform.\" \nNanthavatsiri said that after an internship with Keller and encouragement from the reknowned chef, he closed Pinto and launched the new restaurant at 117 West 10th St., just off Greenwich Avenue, in December, as a sister restaurant to the other eatery he opened earlier last year, Pinto Brooklyn Heights. \nNow, at Pinto Garden, Nanthavatsiri focuses on using ingredients sourced from local purveyors through New York City's Greenmarket Company to produce his favorite authentic Thai dishes from every region of his home country, with a menu that changes seasonally. \nThe current menu features fried chicken wings marinated in Southern Thai spices, roti bread flavored with duck confit and a Sriracha-pickled carrot emulsion, and a traditional Northeast Thai filet mignon tartare drizzled with mint, kaffir, shallots, spicy lime and fish sauce and topped with a quail egg. \nThe chicken wings at Pinto Garden.
