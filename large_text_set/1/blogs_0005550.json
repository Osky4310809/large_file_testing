(Photo: BERTRAND LANGLOIS/AFP/Getty Images)\nThis blog originally appeared on Indian Country Today Media Network .\nJoseph Boyden, author of The Orenda , is a figurehead in native literature and was recently scrutinized for his lack of proof concerning his native roots. Boyden has referred to himself as Celtic, Metis, Ojibway, Mi'kmaq and Nipmuc, and it's super confusing and suspicious.\nWhen APTN award-winning journalist Jorge Barrera questioned all of this, Boyden wrote an apologetic letter that notes how, while he is only a \"little bit\" native, he's enough and he belongs. He stated that he only wanted to discuss the issue further in the \"sacred and safe place\" of a \"speaking circle.\" I'm sorry, Boyden -- unfortunately, Indians like us don't get pity.\nWhen Indians mess up bad in the white world, our awards are taken away and we're not given a platform to apologize or elicit pity (with the possible exception of someone like Sherman Alexie). By the time we feel compelled to \"speak our truth,\" we're already forgotten about or ignored.\nHe requested APTN to bring forth their elder in residence to facilitate a \"speaking circle.\" Does he know a TV corporation might not have an elder in residence? And if they do, I'd go ahead and say they shouldn't be bothered to coddle a successful author who was caught in some PR nightmare.\nWhen we start talking about what an Indian is and isn't, it can negatively affect our people. I get that he wants to repair his relationships with Indian Country and First Nations communities, but dialogue has to happen outside of a circle as well as in. We are contemporary Indians and we live outside of \"traditional\" spaces. We're on Twitter and Facebook, and a lot of our dialogue on identity and authenticity happens in real time online, and not in some conference room with an elder in residence.\nBoyden has the privilege to explain himself and be contrite. It seemed like a letter negotiating with himself on why he still \"belongs\" to indigenous communities.\nThe questions his identity raises are interesting and necessary, but if he's unwilling to have those conversations publicly, he's holding up progress.\nIf he's unwilling to work within our community to discuss the issue of identity, nationhood and race, the best thing he could do is give up any money he'd won under the assumption he was native. He could give up his seat at the table, too.\nHe should know our conflicts are ugly, even within our own communities -- within our own families. He's somewhat perpetuating a stereotype by assuming the only right way to handle an issue is to sit in a circle with an elder in residence.\n(Photo: Ulf Andersen/Getty Images)\nWhen we start talking about what an Indian is and isn't, it can negatively affect our people who have been displaced and just want to know about their ancestors. A native who doesn't know who her grandmother was, but sees traces of her in the shape of her own eyes, her skin and her hands -- she knows somewhere she belongs, and she's searching. I still welcome people like that. They do belong, and so does Boyden -- as people who are justified in their desire to ask questions.\nAcademics have been misguided when they talk about Boyden. They talk about kinship like it's a romantic and nostalgic thing based in belonging. Have they met any of our families? Seriously. They talk about belonging to their land and people as if that's what defines an identity.\nAcademics seem like the least qualified people to talk about identity when they isolate native community members with their vocabularies and classism. At times they can be elitist in how they are more likely to cite an academic on identity over a tribal office worker or single mother on social assistance living on the rez.\nMy relationship to my community doesn't define how Indian I am.\nMy relationship to my indigenous land doesn't define how Indian I am.\nPaperwork is a white man's way of determining our Indian identity. My community is remote. My mother, my aunties and my elders helped me become the woman and mother I am. In many ways my community has also betrayed me. In many ways the government within my community has assimilated to the point where I don't trust them enough. I left my community, but I take the people with me every day. I write for my people and my family. But that relationship is personal -- mine, and it does not define how Indian I am. I am not more Indian for being on the rez, or for leaving it, or even if I never saw it.\nMy land is not my own anymore. After my mother died, a family member asked me to sign my entitlement over. She put the paper and pen in my hands as she was about to give me a ride into town to buy baby formula. She was the only person who helped me get into town for necessities besides social workers, and I needed her. So I signed it. I can't go back to my home. I can't live on the property I grew up on. That does not make me more or less Indian.\nI work every day to call myself a member of this community. My mom raised me to dismantle oppressive forces to make things better for the people to come. I believe in deconstruction and decolonization. Paperwork is a white man's way of determining our Indian identity. Romantic ideas about community, lineage and ancestry aren't always perfect means to an identity when native people have been subjected to genocide and historical erasure.\nThe way Boyden talks, I don't think he can even grasp the way I think about being an Indian, or the way many of us think about it. I mean, in interviews he's defined himself as a bit of a \"two-spirit,\" because he likes to live in New Orleans and Ontario? That's not how that works.\nHe mentions our beliefs in interviews like it's a novelty, a fun fact. You can't sell Indian like a souvenir. I work every day to call myself a member of this community.\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook Also on HuffPost:\nClose  Indigenous Concerns In Canada of   After a detrimental history of residential schools resulting in mental, physical, spiritual and emotional damages, Canada's aboriginal communities still struggle with education. As of 2006, 40 per cent of aboriginals aged 20-24 hadn't earned a high school diploma, compared with 13 per cent of non-Aboriginals. A national panel supported by the Assembly of First Nations and the federal government has drawn attention to a lack of funding for First Nations education. In the 2012 budget, the federal government pledged $275 over three years for First Nations education, although many consider it inadequate -- especially as Aboriginal Affairs' budget is trimmed. Some also attribute the education gap to factors such as living conditions and geographic isolation. Statistics Canada said the causes of a high aboriginal high school dropout rate are largely unresearched, but may include household income, nutrition and parents' level of education.\nAboriginal people are more likely to feel depressed than other Canadians, due to several factors that may include poverty, loss of cultural identity, inadequate health care and more. From 2004 to 2008, the suicide rate among children and teens living in the Inuit homelands was 30 times higher than youth in the rest of Canada, according to the Canadian Press. Several Indigenous communities have also voiced concerns over struggles with addiction. In April, Cat Lake leaders estimated around 70 and 80 per cent of its adults relied on oxycodone-based pain killers, for example.\nRoughly one-third of Metis kids and 37 per cent of First Nations children between ages six and eight are obese, according to a 2012 National Aboriginal Health Organization report. As a result of unhealthy habits, aboriginals in Canada are coping with what the Heart and Stroke Foundation called a \"full-blown cardiovascular crisis\" in 2010. And poor diet, combined with insufficient physical activity, has led to First Nations girls facing higher diabetes rates than other children in Saskatchewan. Poor access to health care has long plagued aboriginal communities, who are now coping with budget cuts to the National Aboriginal Health Organization (NAHO) and the Native Women's Association of Canada's (NWAC) despite increased funding in other areas. Natives march on Portage Ave. towards the Health and Welfare main office located on Main St. Friday morning in Winnipeg to protest cutbacks on Native health care.\nThe Native Women's Association of Canada has documented 582 cases of murdered or missing aboriginal women in Canada as of 2010. Those women make up about 10 per cent of female homicides in Canada. Others estimate the number of missing or murdered women and children over the last 10 years could reach as high at 3,000. Ontario Aboriginal Affairs Minister Kathleen Wynne attributed the problem to police enforcement problems and social issues, although apathy also remains a major stumbling block. Carol Martin wipes away a tear as she attends a Sisters in Spirit vigil held to honour the lives of missing and murdered aboriginal women in Vancouver, B.C., on Sunday October 4, 2009. Vigils were held in dozens of communities across Canada to highlight the issue of murdered aboriginal women and girls.\nAs Western provinces pursue natural resource development, aboriginal representatives demand a say. \"It's important that First Nations not simply be an afterthought,\" Shawn Atleo, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said. Respecting aboriginal rights, in addition to providing information and opportunities, remain sticking points in oil projects, CBC said. And still, groups remain torn on some projects, such as the Northern Gateway pipeline, which some say will bring prosperity, while others believe will have devastating effects on the land. Aboriginal groups have also raised concerns over their roles in hydro and mining projects around Canada.\nNDP MP Charlie Angus' HuffPost Canada blog drew attention to Attawapiskat's state of emergency regarding inadequate shelter, and a lack of running water and electricity. Other First Nations communities experience similar problems, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Shawn Atleo noted. \"These conditions are right across the country. We have many Attawapiskats,\" he said. The issue also raised questions over how communities should efficiently spend government funds, how to fix Canada's infrastructure gap, as well as Attawapiskat's capacity for self-determination.\nMaisy Odjick was last seen on September 6, 2008 in Maniwaki, Quebec.
