The actor and director confirmed in interviews that he was working on the script and would direct it. Warner Bros. and DC already have, in my opinion, too many films on the schedule, but what’s one more, especially when that one stars the best part of an extremely inconsistent movie?\nHowever, now Affleck doesn’t seem so sure that it’s going to happen, at least not in the way he said it would a couple of months ago .\nIn an interview with the Guardian , where he was promoting his latest film Live by Night , Affleck addressed the future of the solo Batman film in unsure terms.\nBasically, the plan now seems to be to continue working on it, but if it doesn’t come together, some things might have to change.\n“That’s the idea. But it’s not a set thing, and there’s no script. If it doesn’t come together in a way I think is really great I’m not going to do it.”\nThe film, tentatively titled The Batman , seemed like a definite thing, at least in how Affleck specifically was addressing it. Test footage, which showed a CGI Deathstroke walking down a hallway towards the camera, was put up on his Twitter page. Joe Manganiello was brought on board to play the villain.\nAffleck said earlier this year that he was planning on directing, writing, and starring in the outing. From interviews, he actually seemed pretty pumped about it .\n“We’re working on the script, the script is going well; I’m really excited about it,” he said.\nDespite all the mixed reactions Batman v Superman has received (and there have been many), Affleck still said there was a silver lining to playing the Caped Crusader on the big screen: his son’s reaction.\n“Sam thinks his dad is Batman…That’s an incredible feeling,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:54:53.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
