His boyfriend at the time believed he died of a drug overdose, but his ex-lover Kenny Goss, who was said to have been his soulmate, said he felt Michael's time had simply come.\nGoss, who was Michael's partner for nearly 15 years until their breakup in 2009, said he was in contact with him for several months before his death and that his body had \"just given up.\" The Texas art dealer flew to England to help Michael's family after his passing, spoke of the family's spirits following his unexpected death.\n\"It was so great to see them and they are doing as well as can be expected. They are doing good,\" Goss told Mirror. \"He was very, very close to both of his sisters. The Greek mentality is to look after people. Melanie made lots of steak. When things are bad they cook – that’s what they do. I’ll be there for the funeral. We just want closure, we want the funeral to \nhappen, it’s been a long time now.\"\nThe pair's split in 2009 was difficult for Michael, but the two remained close friends and would refer to each other as \"soulmates.\"\n\"I love him very much. This man has brought me a lot of joy and pain,\" Michael said at the time of their split. \"My love life has been a lot more turbulent than I’ve ever let on, and I’m so sad about my relationship with Kenny. I’m sorry for any pain.\"\nGoss said he was conflicted about doing any interviews, but a sign from his ex let him know it would be okay.\n\"I wasn’t sure about doing the interview. It was a tricky thing. But Jolene, by Dolly Parton, was one of George’s favourite songs and when I was thinking about what to do it started playing on the radio,\" he said. \"I thought that was a sign. We had two dogs together and one of them was barking a lot, I also thought that was him trying to tell me something. At the end of the day we need to spread the word about the charities. He would have wanted that. That’s the most important thing.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:09:18.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
