It was Windy City native son BJ the Chicago Kid . \nThe singer-songwriter’s shining moment follows on the heels of his scoring not one but three Grammy Award nominations in December for his 2016 Motown debut album In My Mind : Best R&B Performance (“Turnin’ Me Up”), Best Traditional R&B Performance (“Woman’s World”) and Best R&B Album. As the countdown begins to the 59 th annual Grammy Awards on Feb. 12, BJ is busy promoting his recently released mixtape, The Lost Files: Cuffing Season, and new video for his homage to Marvin Gaye , “Uncle Marvin.” \nAnd although he lives in Los Angeles now, as he told Billboard last year, “Chicago is part of my fiber. I keep it with me at all times.” \nHere are a few more insights about BJ the Chicago Kid: \nHe has written songs for Lalah Hathaway and Joe ; has also worked with Dr. Dre , Kanye West , Anderson Paak , Kehlani , The Killers and Anthony Hamilton . \nBJ first came to national notoriety with his guest feature on ScHoolboy Q’s Grammy-nominated 2014 hit “Studio,” which peaked at No. 10 on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and No. 38 on the Billboard Hot 100. \nDebut album In My Mind features Kendrick Lamar (on the track “The New Cupid”), fellow Chicagoan Chance the Rapper (“Church”) and Big K.R.I.T. (“Resume”). Of the album’s revivalist feel, BJ the Chicago Kid told Billboard, “My sound comes from church, but the stories come from actual personal experience, being out there in the streets living life.” \nHe calls singer/songwriter/producer Raphael Saadiq his mentor/big brother: “He’s always pulling my coattails, helping me.” My bro @BJTHECHICAGOKID just sang the National Anthem at the #ObamaFarewell ceremony. This is so monumental! Congrats!!
