By IANS | Published: January 8, 2017 7:28 pm In Focus: Freida Pinto poses at a vineyard! \nPopular American talk show host Ellen DeGeneres thinks Indo-British actor Dev Patel should be named the sexiest man alive. He appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show a few days back to promote his film Lion and DeGeneres encouraged him to start a campaign for Sexiest Man Alive. Ellen said, “Because you look so good, and people are saying you look buff and everything, I had this made for you.” DeGeneres then presented the 26 year-old actor with a fake magazine cover of him as People’s annual hot man honouree. \nEllen added, “You can hand this out, It’ll help your career!” The Slumdog Millionaire star responded back swiftly, “I’ll give it to my mom, and she’ll put it at the entrance to her house. This is very awkward.” Ellen DeGeneres laughed and said, “You don’t understand Hollywood, right?” ALSO READ – Dev Patel says Indian filmmakers have to work like Aamir Khan to push boundaries \nDev Patel is currently on cloud nine after being nominated for the Oscars (in the Best Supporting Actor Category for his film Lion ).
