(Source: Agencies) \nBharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), India’s state-run network provider, has just launched a new tariff plan which costs subscribers Rs 339. With the new plan, BSNL wants to counter the aggressive offers from Reliance Jio and other rival telecom companies. BSNL, under this new plan, will offer 2GB of 3G data every day. The company under the Combo STV (special tariff voucher), priced at Rs 339, is also offering unlimited free calls in the network along with the unlimited data with FUP cap at 2GB for each day. The validity of the offer is 28 days. This offer by BSNL is valid only for 90 days. \nBSNL Director for Consumer Mobility RK Mittal said,”We are committed to providing affordable and efficient services to all segment of our loyal mobile customers. We offer best prices to our customers considering the present trend of Indian telecom industry.” In the calling feature, you will get 25 minutes of free calls to other networks each day, following which a 25 paisa will be charged for each minute of the call. BSNL believes these offers are one of the best in the industry. Recently, according to a parliamentary panel, it was reported that there might be a merger between BSNL and MTNL. Such a partnership will only strengthen the state-run company’s chance to compete against the private players. \nHere is how BSNL compares with other rival telcos, like Reliance Jio, Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone: \nRELIANCE JIO \nEver since Reliance Jio announced its plans in India, there has been an interesting tariff war among telecom companies, where many of the rivals like Airtel and Vodafone have accused it of disrupting the market. While Jio offered its calling and data services for free earlier, both the ‘Welcome Offer’ and ‘Happy New Year’ have now ended. This means, now consumers of Jio network will have to pay for the data services in order to avail the offers. However, the calling will remain free forever, according to Reliance Jio. \nIn order to continue using the previous ‘Happy New Year’ offer, Jio users will have to pay a subscription fee of Rs 99. Additionally, they will have to shell out Rs 303 every month to continue accessing Jio’s 4G services and also the full bouquet of Jio’s media services for one year. Similar to the previous ‘Happy New Year’ offer, the Prime membership too will provide users with a FUP limit of 1GB data for each day. \nYou may want to watch: \nAIRTEL \nMeanwhile, Airtel finally revealed what its Suprise offers are, by offering 30GB of free data. The Airtel Surprise offer is valid for a period of three months from March 13. The monthly limit for the offer is 10GB per month. The offer is valid only for postpaid users, and the subscribers will get 10GB of free data each month, which will total up to 30GB. The deadline for users to avail this offer is March 31. \nAs of now, it provides 30GB of 4G data at Rs 1,495 for a period of three months. If you do not have an Airtel connection and wish to shift to its 4G service, by paying Rs 9,000 for 12 months. Additionally, there is an option of 3GB data at a price of Rs 345. The pack offers free calls to any network in the country and 4GB data (1GB regular pack benefit and 3GB free data). For postpaid users, you can get free 3 GB data per month with all MyPlan Infinity Plans. The Rs 549 Infinity plan will be offering unlimited calling and also 6GB data per month including the 3GB free data plan. The regular plan includes free voice calling (Local + STD), free SMS and subscriptions to Wynk Music and Wynk Movies. Customers need to access the MyAirtel App to avail the offer. \nIDEA CELLULAR \nIdea Cellular is going all out to take on Reliance Jio and its data offers. Idea has associated with itel, a smartphone brand, to give Indian users 1GB of free data every month for six months. Idea, recently decided to make all roaming calls in India free, after Bharti Airtel , India’s leading network provider announced the removal of all roaming charges for outgoing and incoming calls as well as SMSes and data usage in India \nIt is not sure how the possible merger with Vodafone will pan out for the company, yet it is trying its best to match up to the prices currently. It is offering 1GB data per month for Rs 348, along with unlimited calling feature. If you recharge with this pack on a new 4G-enabled handset, you will get additional 3GB data. The validity for the pack is 28 days and can be availed for a maximum of 13 recharges in 365 days. There is a Rs 499 rental plan for postpaid subscribers too, which will give users unlimited local, national and incoming roaming calls with 3GB free data. \nA funny ad campaign by Idea, mocking Reliance Jio: \nVODAFONE \nVodafone is offering 6GB data per month for Rs 349, along with unlimited voice calls. In another new offer, any user who buys the 1GB data pack for Rs 250, will now get 4GB data with a validity of 28 days. Additionally, Vodafone will also give 22GB of data when you recharge your number with Rs 999. For that price, earlier customers could get only 10GB of 4G data. This new offer can be availed in all regions where the company offers its 4G services. The data pack which offers four times the usual value can be availed through online media and also local retailer recharges. The other offers by Vodafone are Rs 350 for 6GB data, Rs 450 for 9GB data, Rs 15,00 for 35GB data. While the four-time increase is not for all the offers, but the Rs 250 one.
