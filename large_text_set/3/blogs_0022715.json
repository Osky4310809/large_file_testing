the Bundesliga and beyond MAN UTD EYE OX-CHAMBERLAIN \nManchester United are interested in signing Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain this summer, according to the Daily Mirror . \nThe England international looks likely to leave north London at the end of this season, and United are monitoring his situation as Jose Mourinho looks to add to his squad. PSG MAKE WENGER OFFER \nParis Saint-Germain have offered Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger a two-year contract to take over at Parc des Princes, according to The Sun . \nThe Ligue 1 champions are set to sack Unai Emery after a disappointing first year in charge and are hopeful of tempting Wenger back to his homeland should he leave Arsenal. ARSENAL TARGET LACAZETTE \nLyon striker Alexandre Lacazette tops Arsenal's striker shortlist ahead of a summer rebuild in north London, according to the Daily Mirror . \nArsene Wenger is planning for life without Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil, and the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Marco Reus and Moussa Dembele are also on the Gunners's list of targets. BAKAYOKO FAVOURS CHELSEA \nMonaco midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko favours a move to Chelsea this summer, according to The Sun . \nManchester United are also keen on the Ligue 1 star, but Antonio Conte sees him as a good long-term option for his squad at Stamford Bridge. LIVERPOOL ENTER KEANE RACE \nLiverpool are the latest club to show an interest in signing Burnley defender Michael Keane, according to the Daily Mail . \nManchester United and Chelsea have both previously been linked with the centre-back, and now the Reds are set to battle their rivals at the end of the campaign. SIMEONE FREE TO LEAVE ATLETICO \nManager Diego Simeone is free to leave Atletico Madrid this summer, according to CalcioMercato . \nReports had suggested the Argentine had a €50 million release clause in his contract, but it has now been confirmed that is not the case were Inter or Arsenal to make their move. BARCA SEEK COUTINHO \nBarcelona are ready to move for Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho in the summer transfer window, according to the Mirror . \nThe Catalans' midfield is far from settled, and with Andres Iniesta possibly leaving at the end of 2018, Coutinho and PSG star Marco Verratti are Barca's top candidates to replace the legend. CITY READY TO SPLASH OUT ON BONUCCI \nPep Guardiola is looking to strengthen his Manchester City defence with a massive bid for Leonardo Bonucci, according to the Daily Star . \nCity's defensive frailties have cost them dearly this season, having conceded six over two legs against Monaco to exit the Champions League. \nBut Bonucci would not come cheap, with the Juventus star carrying an estimated asking price of £50 million. SHAW LOOKING FOR UNITED EXIT \nOut-of-favour Manchester United defender Luke Shaw is desperate to kickstart his career away from Old Trafford, according to the Daily Star . \nStoke City, Newcastle United and Crystal Palace are all monitoring Shaw's situation should he leave, following a season where he has barely featured under Jose Mourinho. ARSENAL APPROACH TUCHEL \nArsenal have already made contact with Thomas Tuchel in their bid to find a replacement for manager Arsene Wenger, according to Bild . \nWhile the Frenchman is yet to declare whether he will stay at the Emirates, his future is extremely uncertain — and the Borussia Dortmund coach has been identified as a worthy successor. MAN CITY CONFIDENT ON MESSI \nManchester City believe that they can take advantage of Barcelona's reluctance to meet Lionel Messi's wage demands this summer, reports the Sunday Express . \nPep Guardiola is to be given £200 million to spend in the next transfer window, plus whatever he makes from sales, with a raid on his former employers at Camp Nou figuring prominently in his thoughts. CHELSEA & CITY LODGE COMAN BIDS \nChelsea and Manchester City have tabled £43 million offers for Bayern Munich loan star Kingsley Coman, according to The Sun . \nThe German champions are hoping to strike a permanent £18m deal this summer, but the Frenchman's parent club, Juventus, would prefer to sell to another team for a higher price. ARSENAL WANT BARKLEY \nArsenal have joined the race to sign wantaway Everton attacker Ross Barkley, according to the Daily Mirror . \nThe England international, 22, will be sold by the Toffees this summer if he does not sign a new contract with the club. \nChelsea and Tottenham are among the other Premier League teams believed to be keen to snap up Barkley should he leave Goodison Park. INTER & SEVILLA WANT SON \nInter and Sevilla have both made enquiries regarding the availability of Tottenham forward Heung-Min Son, according to the Evening Standard . \nThe South Korea international is currently enjoying his best season at White Hart Lane but could be tempted away by the promise of more regular football. UNITED & MADRID WANT SCHMEICHEL \nReal Madrid have added Leicester City's Kasper Schmeichel to the goalkeeping shortlist for the summer, according to Don Balon . \nLos Blancos have been impressed with the Dane's performances in the Champions League this season, though they could face competition from Manchester United. INTER OFFER CONTE HUGE CONTRACT \nInter are set to offer Chelsea manager Antonio Conte a £13 millon-a-year deal in a bid to lure him to San Siro, according to The Sun . \nSuch a contract would see the former Juventus manager double his current wages, with the Serie A outfit willing to hand him full control of transfers should he join. CITY TURN TO RUDIGER \nManchester City are hopeful of completing a £30 million deal to sign Roma defender Antonio Rudiger, according to the Daily Mirror . \nCity have scouted the Germany international extensively, though they could face competition from Chelsea for his signature. ARSENAL PLOT KEITA MOVE \nArsenal are plotting a summer move for RB Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita, according to SportBild . \nThe Bundesliga outfit are unlikely to sell for less than £26 million, with Bayern Munich also monitoring the player's progress.
