Most are the result of a fare dispute, but an alarming number happen just because someone wants to do violence to a bus driver,” the union’s international president, Larry Hanley, said in a statement.\n“ATU demands that transit agencies and government officials bring the same sense of regret that they will display in the public mourning of this tragic, unnecessary death of our brother to the ongoing discussion about preventing these attacks from occurring.”\nDetails of what prompted the attack are still not clear. Union officials said the altercation started on the bus and then spilled outside the bus.\nNobody else was believed to be on the bus when the attack occurred, Winnipeg police said. They said officers got the call just before 2 a.m. and found Fraser suffering from serious stab wounds. He died at hospital.\nOfficers, led by a canine unit, arrested a 22-year-old suspect trying to cross the frozen Red River and took him back to the river bank.\nAt one point, a canine officer returned to the river to continue the investigation and fell through the ice. Officers used a rope to pull him to safety; he was not injured.\nFriends and co-workers, meanwhile, remembered Fraser as a big man with a booming voice, easy smile and hearty handshake. Union officials said Fraser and his wife looked after their young granddaughter after their daughter passed away.\n“For a guy that had a lot of struggles, this is not the way he should’ve gone,” Callahan said.\n“It’s heartbreaking for all of us,” said Aleem Chaudhary, Local 1505’s executive vice-president. “He was liked by everybody — always had time to talk to you.”\nFraser wasn’t the type of driver “who would care about a bus fare if somebody said, ‘Oh I need a ride,’ ” Giesbrecht told reporters.\n“I’m pretty shaken up. It’s supposed to be Valentine’s Day, not a day of mourning. It’s supposed to be about love, not death.”\nThere is no reason this should’ve happened. … My fellow brother was murdered for doing his job last night.\nGiesbrecht, a bus driver for 19 years, said he now counts himself among those in support of protective barriers for drivers.\n“How many crazies are out there that I just let on the bus that are just on the verge? I don’t know. … My opinion is now I’m at the point of put me in a cage.”\nA federal law was passed in February 2015 to allow for more severe penalties for attacks on bus drivers. Bregg’s Law was named after Edmonton transit driver Tom Bregg, who was beaten so severely that he suffered brain injuries and lost the sight in one eye.\nBregg was driving his route during the morning rush hour in December 2009 when he was hit several times by a drunken man, who did not want to pay the $2.50 fare.\nThe attacker dragged the driver off the bus and stomped on his face more than a dozen times when he became wedged between the bus and the curb.\nBregg was in hospital for more than eight weeks.\nGary Mattson pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was declared a dangerous offender.\nWinnipeg police posted a tweet Tuesday trying to reassure rattled residents that it was safe to take buses.\n“Our public transit is safe,” it quoted Chief Danny Smith saying. “I ride the bus. My family rides the bus. I believe it is safe.”\nWith files from The Canadian Press \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:41:33.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
