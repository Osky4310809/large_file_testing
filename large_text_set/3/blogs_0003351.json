Additionally, the SRH features a Rolls Royce badge on the front and license plate in the back. It can be limited to as low as 4 mph and does not feature a horn. \nThe car was built in Goodwood, England and was unveiled at the hospital on Wednesday. \n“It’s wonderful seeing a smiley face on the way to [the operation room], rather than an apprehensive one, and everyone caring for children at St Richard’s is so grateful to Rolls-Royce for this unique donation,” said Sue Nicholls, Pediatric Matron at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. “We know boys and girls alike will love driving it and in the coming years it will help turn a daunting experience into a more fun and enjoyable one for hundreds and hundreds of children.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:32:25.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
