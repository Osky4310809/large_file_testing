This is a show that started dropping bombshells with its very first episode, and followed up pretty consistently every other week or so. Viewers got used to their jaws dropping into the puddles of their tears. It was heart-wrenching television, but in such a satisfying way. \nThat's why it's so disappointing that this felt more like one of those nice little interstitial episodes where nothing huge happens, rather than a season finale. \"This Is Us\" won't be back on the air until September, and that's a long time to leave fans waiting. The most impactful season finales in television history have left fans wondering throughout the hiatus, exemplified best by the infamous \"Who shot J.R.?\" summer of \"Dallas.\" \nRead the rest of our \"'This Is Us' Finale Fakeout\" . \nAnd here is what ‚ÄúThis Is Us‚Äù fans are saying: The only theory I have about Jack‚Äôs death is the door was totally big enough for both of them #thisisus ‚Äî Ryan Seacrest (@RyanSeacrest) March 15, 2017 BUT HOW DOES JACK DIE?!?! #ThisIsUs ‚Äî ü§ôüèΩDustin C.ü§ôüèΩ (@_leimana) March 15, 2017 So @TheMandyMoore & @MiloVentimiglia were amazing tonight.
