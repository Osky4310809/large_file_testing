About a year ago, The original (and best) Kylie got her lawyers involved and asked them to put a stop to The Lesser Kylie’s attempt at cornering the market on the name Kylie . According to Kylie Minogue, Kylie Jenner – or as Kylie Minogue called her, a “ secondary reality television personality ” – doesn’t get to call dibs on “ Kylie ” because she already has a trademark on the name.\nThe US Patent and Trademark Office agrees. The Daily Mail says that last week, the PTO sided with Kylie Minogue and rejected Kylie Jenner’s application. Kylie Minogue is the official Kylie. Kylie’s trademark fight isn’t over yet. The Daily Mail says that Kylie Jenner has already filed an appeal on the decision.\nThe Kardashians and the Jenners have been programmed by Kris Jenner to want to monetize every possible aspect of their lives. And one of the ways they like to ensure that every last dollar gets tucked into their wallets is to trademark their names. It’s practically a rite of passage for them. So of course Kylie would appeal. And she’ll keep fighting until she gets her trademark. The last thing Kylie Jenner wants is to receive a letter from her mother warning her that she’s at risk of being ex-kommunicated from the family for failing to uphold their fame whore values. I’m sorry Kylie Minogue, this rash just isn’t going to go away.\nPic: Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:05:32.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
