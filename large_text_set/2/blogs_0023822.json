This map is a successor to that of J.G.C. Anderson (1903) and its partial revision by W.M. Calder and G.E. Bean (1958). It was displayed in draft at the ‘Roads and Routes in Anatolia’ conference organized by the British Institute at Ankara (March 2014). It was then revised with a view to being issued with the volume planned to follow that meeting in due course. Meantime the Center is now making the map available online. \nThe map may be downloaded from Dropbox at this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:56:07.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
