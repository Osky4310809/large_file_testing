Ryan Scrivens.\n“It was of extreme concern. We dispatched multiple officers who arrived there shortly thereafter and we were able to arrest a man.”\nNo firearm was found.\n“He was threatening to come back and shoot members of the mosque,” said Scrivens.\nPolice aren’t sure why the threat was made. More than 15 officers arrived at the mosque.\nSources close to the mosque, who declined to be identified, dismissed any suggestion of racial or religious violence, saying a man asked for and was given food, but things escalated when he asked for money but wasn’t given any.\nNo charges had been laid, but the suspect was arrested on suspicion of “uttering threats of causing death,” said Scrivens. Police aren’t looking for anyone else.\n“We are now convinced this was an unarmed person,” said Nawaz Tahir, a spokesperson for the mosque.\nNo increase in mosque security is planned.\n“We are in that environment, we have security around the mosque, police assist us regularly with security protocol,” said Tahir.\nA Jan. 30 shooting attack on a mosque in Quebec City killed six people dead and wounded 19, making police vigilant whenever they receive a call related to a mosque.\n“Given our current climate, in our society, this causes concern,” said Scrivens.\nThe investigation continues.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:20:44.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
