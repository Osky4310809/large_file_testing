Liverpool vs Everton Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \nClub captain Jagielka is hoping he and the rest of the Everton squad will be able to speak with Coleman ahead of the Merseyside derby as the Toffees go in search of their first win at Anfield since 1999. \n\"There are two massive games coming up and that's one thing Seamus will want us to do, to play well and get some good results,\" the 34-year-old said. \n\"We'll all be thinking about him and, come Saturday and Tuesday, I'm sure he'll have the TV on and be cheering us on. \n\"There'll be no incentive needed, but the circumstances over the last few days might add a bit of a motivational edge on our behalf. Jagielka is hoping Everton can secure victory at Anfield for the injured Coleman \n\"We want to go out there and play well and it will be nice if we can all get to speak to Seamus beforehand.\" \nColeman has been a pivotal member of Ronald Koeman's starting line-up - starting 26 of Everton's 29 Premier League matches - and pitched in with four valuable goals and numerous assists. \nAnd Jagielka admits Coleman's leadership qualities will be a huge miss for Everton. \n\"Seamus is a massive part of the furniture. He's been here a long time now, he's one of the leaders,\" he told Everton.tv . \n\"All we can do is be there for him. He's had the operation, it's been a success and he's on the slow road to recovery. Ronald Koeman's Everton have been on a strong recent run of form \n\"As a club, a family, we have wished him a speedy recovery and we will be with him every step of the way. He's a great lad and hopefully we can get him smiling around the club as soon as possible. \n\"He'll be down at the moment because it's not long since it happened. His friends and family away from football will help him through these initial stages. \n\"When he is able to do things it's up to us as a club - the players, physios, coaches. I'm sure we'll be able to get him to where he needs to get to. Mason Holgate could replace Coleman, having played seven times for Everton this season \n\"Hopefully it is as quick as possible, but the main thing is that he gets back to the levels he's been showing, not just this season.\" \nColeman's absence leaves Koeman debating whether to switch to a back three and promote Ramiro Funes Mori from the bench or go for a straight swap in Mason Holgate. \nFunes Mori received a red card in the Merseyside derby last season at Anfield while Holgate has impressed in his limited opportunities this season, scoring two goals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:43:11.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
