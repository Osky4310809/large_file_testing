And while an ear dedicated to helping me remember the items my housemate asked me to pickup at the store last week has yet to be commercialized into a startup, Chorus.ai is riffing off the concept to deliver a solution to help sales teams close more deals. The team is announcing a $16 million Series A today led by Redpoint . \nTaking a page from companies like Cogito and Deepgram , Chorus.ai is first and foremost a system for extracting insights from audio. But unlike Cogito that got its start servicing call centers, Chorus.ai is setting its sights on sales. \nIn the style of X.ai , Chorus simply joins conference calls, in the same way a human would, to record and transcribe content in real-time. The platform flags important action items and topics that came up over the duration of the call. \n“We have invested in algorithms that are tuned to sales, but even some simple keyword matching adds a lot of value,” explains Roy Raanani, co-founder and CEO of Chorus.ai. \nThe platform that the Chorus team built broadly serves two functions. Because it transcribes calls, it serves as a valuable reference for sales reps when completing follow-ups on action items. But Chorus can also add enterprise value by acting as a training ground for reps to share best practices and closing strategies. \nChorus.ai is the latest example of an AI startup finding vitality through verticalization. Though Raanani was careful not to commit to any numbers, he explained that Chorus is likely better than products like IBM’s Watson at the specialized task of sales. Intuitively, mastery of general speech recognition is a harder task than mastery of language commonly used in the domain of sales. Even today, with speech recognition mostly a solved problem, many systems still struggle to parse the complexities (or lack there of) in the speech of young children for example. \nIn just four months, the company transitioned through the gears of a seed stage startup. Its first round, led by Emergence Capital Partners , who also participated in today’s round, closed in October of last year for $6.3 million. All the while Raanani, and his co-founder Micha Breakstone, have been polishing off the Chorus platform. The team has built out key integrations with a number of meeting and support platforms like Zoom, BlueJeans, WebEX and Salesforce. And they have closed customers themselves like Qualtrics and Marketo. \nIn the future, Raanani and his team want to double down on the real-time advantage of the Chorus platform. The idea being that sales reps pitching to a potential client could leverage the speed of machines to pull up content in real time to help close a deal. If a customer on the phone references a competitor, Chorus could flash an informational aid on screen with known differentiators and past successful pitches. Featured Image: H.
