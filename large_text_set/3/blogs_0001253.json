(Reuters) \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi , SP Chief Akhilesh Yadav , Rahul Gandhi and BSP supremo Mayawati will descend on Varanasi tomorrow making it their battleground ahead of the last phase of UP polls, a schedule that has put the administration on its toes. According to the programme received by the district administration here, Modi is scheduled to arrive at his Lok Sabha constituency at about 3 PM and leave for the Kashi Vishwanath temple after resting for an hour at the guest house of the Benares Hindu University. \nIn what is likely to cause jitters to the administration and badly affect traffic in the city known for its congested streets, the Prime Minister’s tour will be coinciding with a joint road show by Gandhi and Yadav. The road show was postponed twice last month and is now being held with two more days to go for campaigning in the final lap of seven-phase assembly polls. The SP- Congress alliance hopes to cause an upset in three of the five Assembly segments falling under Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency currently held by the BJP . \nHere are updates on all Uttar Pradesh phase 7 elections-related events:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T05:50:10.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
