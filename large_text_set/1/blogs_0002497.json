Clad in a sparkling suit similar to that worn by Carey, the Coyote sang her 1991 hit “Emotions” but failed to finish due to a technical problem. Out of frustration, the mascot stormed off the court. \nSpurs was not the first NBA team to throw shade at the singer. The Indiana Pacers organized a “lip-sync cam” by filming fans chanting her song. \nCarey suffered the embarrassing meltdown during her number at “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” held in New York’s Time Square.
