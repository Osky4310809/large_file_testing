Legspinner Amit Mishra and right-arm offspinner Parvez Rasool have been picked to replace the duo in the squad. \nThe selectors decided to rest Ashwin and Jadeja after consulting the Indian team management, following the home side's 2-1 series win in the One-Day International series. India have been managing the workloads of both the spinners since the start of the home season. Following the 3-0 series win over New Zealand in the Test series, both Ashwin and Jadeja were not picked for the subsequent ODI series in order to keep them fresh for the five Tests against England. \nIndia's T20I squad: Lokesh Rahul, Mandeep Singh, Virat Kohli(c), MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Amit Mishra, Parvez Rasool, Yuzvendra Chahal, Manish Pandey, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ashish Nehra © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T10:46:41.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
