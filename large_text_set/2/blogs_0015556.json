He’s also authored three full-length books and three Amazon Kindle Single e-books, including 2015’s The Bern Identity: A Search for Bernie Sanders and the New American Dream.

Ask anyone who's ever suggested that the right to bear arms might have a few small limitations and then watched 2nd Amendment enthusiasts -- even folks who couldn't tell the difference between a \" Saturday Night Special \" and Saturday Night Live -- pour out of the woodwork. The 2nd Amendment -- at least as interpreted by gun enthusiasts -- has its own powerful and well-funded lobbying group, the National Rifle Association, that always causes a majority of U.S. politicians to do what politicians do best, which is cower in fear. \nhad that kind of love. You'd think the 1st Amendment would be the most popular one, not just because of numerical superiority but because it covers so much stuff -- the right to speak freely, the right to a free press, free assembly, freedom of movement, and even the right to worship. Even the right to petition the government with grievances is covered by the 1st Amendment, meaning this is the amendment that makes Festivus possible . Who doesn't support that? \nthe 2nd Amendment is what makes the 1st Amendment possible \" (which I'm not convinced is true, by the way) 0r b) when some weird dude named Milo wants to give his white supremacy spiel on college campuses. ( In fairness, campus liberals haven't done the 1st Amendment many favors lately .) Unlike the all-powerful NRA, the lobbying group best associated with free speech -- the American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU -- still gets bashed as Commie pinkos by a lot of people. And the flesh-and-blood press tasked with carrying out a key part of the 1st Amendment is struggling for oxygen in the 21st Century, with our old business model in a state of free fall. \nwhipping up resentment toward the media and other so-called \"elites,\" has now managed to up the ante in just the first month of his presidency. \na remarkably rambling 77-minute press conference and bombshell revelations about the incoming administration's dealings with Russia -- took to Twitter to lash out at the media in generally and specifically at the New York Times, CNN, ABC, NBC, and CBS, branding them as \" enemies of the American people .\" \neither paid homage to the 1st Amendment or trashed it -- depending on your perspective -- by starting the event with the Christian Lord's Prayer, before her husband stepped up his unholy war on a free media. \nTrump told his supporters . \"They don't get it.\" He cited newspaper criticisms from Thomas Jefferson -- omitting the other times when Jefferson called the press essential to democracy -- and said the media is \"part of a corrupt system,\" adding: \"They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda.\" \ncough, cough Richard Nixon ) behind closed doors. But there's never before been a time when the president used his bully pulpit and the full powers of his office to publicly attack, in essence, one of the fundamental pillars of the Bill of Rights. He is trying to delegitimize the very notion of a free press as it's practiced in America in the 21st Century -- and thus strengthen his own power as an authoritarian ruler at the expense of his diminished watchdogs. \nHitler and his minions called the media the \"lügenpresse,\" or lying press. Even Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former presidential candidate with his own love-hate relationship with reporters, told NBC's Chuck Todd earlier today that attacking the press in such a fashion is \" how dictators get started .\" It didn't escape notice that McCain was speaking from Munich, a stone's throw from the site of the Beer Hall Putsch . \nTrump son-in-law and closest adviser Jared Kushner lodging complaints to top executives at CNN's parent Time-Warner about specific pundits critical of Trump , at the same time Time-Warner is seeking federal approval for a merger. And in a nation that's seen its share of terror attacks and assassination attempts over the years, who knows how Trump will treat a free press when an actual crisis hits the fan? \nThe president's false, bizarre and frankly dangerous assertion that there had been a terror attack in Sweden was just the latest example in a line of untruths that includes blatant, repeated lies about the U.S. crime rate, the margin of Trump's election victory , and the size of his inauguration crowd. \nalternative facts ,\" to set the terms of what is true without regard to any sense of objective reality and especially without regard to \"the very, very dishonest media.\" And the ability to manufacture reality is the essence of totalitarianism. \nto do your job ,\" to keep working on exposing truths, wherever the chips may fall. \nDaniel Pearl , murdered by al-Qaeda thugs in Pakistan, or the Arizona Republic's Don Bolles , who was killed by mobsters with a car bomb. In this uncertain time, I'd also remind people of the work that journalists do that maybe isn't life-or-death, but still as important as hell. Just pick up today's Inquirer and read the front-page piece by Stephanie Farr and Sam Wood, with photos by Michael Bryant, on the rampant heroin abuse that takes place along El Campamento, the grim freight-rail embankment that cuts through Kensington . With local journalism hanging by a thread in 2017, an all-out war of libel suits, regulatory pressure and whipping up an angry public may have the collateral effect of destroying this type of journalism in the years ahead. And when such stories disappear, City Hall will be perfectly comfortable doing nothing to fix problems that no longer see the light of day. \nwomen , immigrants , and even scientists have done or will do under Trump, but regular citizens can pick up the slack to remind the government -- and their neighbors -- that a free press is a fundamental American right and that regular people even support the 1st Amendment as enthusiastically as Elk County hunters back the 2nd. \nGod knows I've used Attytood as a platform to criticize the New York Times , CNN and others -- but only because I want a tough and fair-minded press to do better. That 1st Amendment ideal is tonight facing its gravest threat yet. The months ahead will determine whether an independent media will the ones working, imperfectly, toward finding and sharing a real and objective truth, or whether the terms and conditions of reality will be set by an all-powerful Trump government. \nd foremost, we have to want it. our guidelines | Comments FAQ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:45:03.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
