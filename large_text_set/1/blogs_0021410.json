Tweet Posted: Tue, 1/24/2017 - 5:35pm by Cat Pajamas \nIf you didn't get a chance to watch it, My Super Sweet 16 was a reality show where the spoiled kids of filthy rich parents held ridiculously elaborate sweet 16 parties. It was dramatic, it was hilarious, and at one point it featured a rather creepy cameo from Pauly Shore. Well, whether you're an OG fan of the show or you haven't seen an episode, now's your time to get on board because MTV is bringing it back, with some slight changes... \nThey’ll probably still cast brats, though. (Source) \nAccording to a casting notice for a new MTV show called My Super Sweet , the network isn't just looking for kids throwing elaborate 16th birthday parties — they're opening up the show to people of all ages who are throwing a \"Sweet Sixteen, Quinceanera, Debutante Ball, Debut, or any other coming of age milestone event.\" So you might want to send this casting call to anyone you know looking to throw a LIT 70th. \nRich kids and celebs alike filmed some crazy and epic and insane parties for the show, including Chris Brown, Soulja Boy, and Kanye West's most recent video vixen, Teyana Taylor. And now that we're living in a world where kids can be millionaires in their own right as social media stars, there's probably going to be a larger casting pool than ever before. Even Jennifer Lawrence was attached to the series in one point, as one of her first gigs was acting in a commercial for the show, so maybe they'll bring her back to host a REAL party! (Probably not tho.) \nEven J-Law had to pay the bills at one point! Would you watch a new edition of My Super Sweet 16 , or are you sad that reality shows are still a thing in general?
