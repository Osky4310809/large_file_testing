Or maybe you know someone who drinks it regularly and swears it’s made them healthier. View this image ›\n@DianaFreedman_ / Via Twitter: @DianaFreedman_ Some of the health claims include that it’s good for digestion and the immune system , it improves hair and skin health , it detoxifies the liver , and it can even treat serious diseases like AIDS , cancer , and diabetes .\nID: 10397289 3. But, if you’re like me, then you’ve heard all of this and still have no clue what kombucha actually is. View this image ›\nParamount / Via gifrific.com So I spoke to two registered dietitians to get a better idea, and to figure out if there’s any science behind those claims. Here’s what I found out.\nID: 10397802 4. Kombucha starts with a bologna-looking gelatinous thing called a SCOBY , which stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast. View this image ›\nGreenartphotography / Via gettyimages.com Yum. It’s basically a collection of bacteria and yeast living in harmony, and while there are several strains of yeast that can be in a SCOBY, the main type of bacteria tends to be acetic acid bacteria .\nID: 10398529 5. The SCOBY is then thrown into a jar of black or green tea and sugar, where it’s given time to infuse and ferment. View this image ›\n@paleo.debbs / Via instagram.com This can take anywhere from 7-14 days, depending on the temperature of the environment, registered dietitian nutritionist Angie Murad, of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program, tells BuzzFeed Health. During that time, the yeast and bacteria feed off the sugar — and typically grow into a “daughter” SCOBY — making the tea carbonated and slightly alcoholic (store-bought kombucha should have less than 0.5% unless otherwise noted).\nAt the end of it all, the SCOBY is removed (and possibly reused) and the remaining drink is filtered and stored in the fridge.\nID: 10397984 6. The finished product might still contain live bacteria and yeast. View this image ›\nNew Line Cinema / Via giphy.com But this isn’t going to harm you, especially if you’re drinking store-bought kombucha, registered dietitian Despina Ghandi, of NYU Medical Center, tells BuzzFeed Health. Acetic acid bacteria have probiotic qualities , so they can aid in gastrointestinal (GI) health. And since “so much of our immune system is influenced by our GI tract, by honing in on it, we can technically boost immunity as well,” says Ghandi.\n“It’s not to say, though, that if you drink kombucha every day you’re not going to get a cold,” adds Murad. “It can just help you — it’s not something that’s necessarily harmful to your intestines.”\nJust make sure the kombucha you’re drinking isn’t pasteurized, because that would effectively kill most, if not all, of the good bacteria in the drink, she says. So check the label for that.\nID: 10398867 7. Aside from potentially boosting GI health and your immune system, most of the health claims about kombucha aren’t proven. View this image ›\n20th Century Fox / Via giphy.com Though that’s not to say some of them aren’t possible.\nFor example, kombucha was shown to reduce certain cancer cells’ ability to spread (though this was done outside of the body), according to a 2014 review . That same review said the basis for some of the other claims, like detoxifying the liver and boosting immunity, could be from the antioxidant properties of the tea. Meanwhile, another study saw a drop in diabetic rats’ blood sugar levels after drinking kombucha.\nAnd while we could not find any studies specifically testing the effects of kombucha on skin or hair, it’s possible that the antioxidants in green tea kombucha reduce the damaging effects of UV rays on the skin. With regard to AIDS, one article suggests that the bacteria in kombucha can actually overstimulate the immune systems of HIV-positive people, who already have overstimulated immune systems, leading to complications.\n“The important thing to remember is there are no clinical trials that prove kombucha can do these things, so they’re really just claims and anecdotal evidence,” Ghandi says.\nID: 10399296 8. Heads up: Drinking homemade kombucha could actually put your health at risk if you’re not careful. View this image ›\nLucasfilm / Via tenor.co This is especially true if you or the person who gave you the kombucha are inexperienced at making it, says Ghandi.\n“If you’re doing it at home, you can introduce bad bacteria into the system, and people have become very ill,” Murad says. “So you have to be careful and have clean food practices when you’re fermenting the kombucha.”\nLikewise, fermenting the drink for too long can make it overly acidic, and drinking it like that can lead to metabolic acidosis, a condition where there’s too much acid in the body.\nFor these reasons, both dietitians recommended drinking only store-bought kombucha.\nID: 10399593 9. So, should you drink kombucha? View this image ›\n@kombuchahunter / Via instagram.com Tbh, it’s probably not gonna hurt if you drink it. Both experts agree that if you’re healthy, you’re not pregnant (because it does have some alcohol), and you don’t have a compromised immune system, then you’ll be fine drinking it. That said, you should also keep an eye on the label for sugar content (since some companies will add juice for taste) and how many servings are in a bottle, Murad says.\nOn the other hand, if you’ve been thinking about drinking it for its ~health benefits~, then there are a number of other (cheaper) fermented options you can try — like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi, and tempe, say Murad and Ghandi.\n“The bottom line is that it’s not necessary to be part of a balanced diet,” says Ghandi. “It doesn’t contain lots of vitamins, minerals, or anything like that.” But, of course, if you love it and your doctor says it’s fine to drink it — have at it!\nID: 10399872 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!", "external_links": ["http://gifrific.com/chris-farley-saying-no-idea-black-sheep/", "http://www.treating-cancer-alternatively.com/Kombucha.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11363369", "http://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-christmas-movies-1994-l1IY5J4Cfw8JLi40M", "https://bmccomplementalternmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6882-12-63", "http://giphy.com/gifs/coffee-drinking-u9QoHec9uGfq8", "http://hildablue.com/2014/03/05/kombucha-for-skin-care-and-other-kombucha-recipes/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPqy3t3huJ7/", "https://www.ttb.gov/kombucha/kombucha-general.shtml#labeling", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPrOG9qjpRF/", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1541-4337.12073/full", "https://www.tenor.co/view/foodcoma-stuffed-so-full-gif-3575836", "http://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/balanced-living/healthy-living/cured-by-kombucha/", "http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/kombucha-tea-risks-and-benefits", "http://www.fasebj.org/content/30/1_Supplement/1090.7.short", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPrKQpOD3_K/", "http://www.realnatural.org/kombucha-protects-the-liver/", "http://jn.nutrition.org/content/141/6/1202.short", "https://twitter.com/DianaFreedman_/status/787105936213147648", "http://www.livestrong.com/article/531073-kombucha-and-diabetes/", "http://www.gettyimages.com/license/491264952", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijfs.12718/abstract"], "published": "2017-01-30T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T17:28:54.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
