Avdotja founded Lumpen , a Moscow modeling agency that specializes in unusual and less commercial faces (“lumpen” is Russian for outcast or outsider) — her guys have walked for the likes of Gosha Rubchinskiy and COMME des GARÇONS — and Sever is one of the company’s most well-known faces.\nFor SS17, The North Face has a bevy of outerwear for all sorts of demanding weather conditions, alongside cozy branded basics for less adventurous TNF aficionados. Color-wise, things are mainly low-key and neutral, with the exception of some bright hi-vis orange — so you’ll stand out on the street and/or mountainside.\nCheck out our street style story with Sever.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T17:30:35.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
