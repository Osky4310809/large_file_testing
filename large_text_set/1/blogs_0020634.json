BRIAN STELTER: I want to choose my words as carefully as possible, Brooke. We talked about before the election about how Donald Trump talked about how the election would be rigged and how that would undermine the election, but here we are on his fourth day in office -- the only word I can think of is crazy. It is crazy. It's crazy to think that 3-5 million people voted illegally in this election, it of course undermines Democracy, but it undermines facts. It is just a dark day. We heard about alternative facts by Kellyanne Conway, this is an 'alternative fact.' The truth is that many Americans believe there is illegal voting. So \"The New York Times\" reached out to the appropriate authorities in each state and The Times found that all 50 states (except for Kansas which didn't respond) found no indication of widespread fraud. I think the question is: Does Donald Trump want to be remembered as the fake news president? Does he want to be remembered as the conspiracy theory president? I don't think he does, so he's either got to present evidence and acknowledge that the election was successful and he won, what's next, Brooke, is NASA going to say that the moon is made of green cheese?
