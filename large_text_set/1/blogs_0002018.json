Part of the appeal is due to Yoo Yeon Seok and Seo Hyun Jin ’s chemistry, which recently won them a Best Couple award at the 2016 SBS Drama Awards. Spoilers \nYoo Yeon Seok’s prickly but talented Kang Dong Joo and Seo Hyun Jin’s passionate and hardworking Yoon Seo Jung have caught our attention from Episode 1. As their romance began in earnest in Episode 14, here are four recent moments when their chemistry made us feel warm and fuzzy inside. “Sunlight Embrace” (Episode 14) \nIn Episode 14, there was a MERS scare that ended with Yoo Yeon Seok collapsing and Seo Hyun Jin keeping guard by his bedside. When he woke up, after some sweet back-and-forth, they ended up embracing in the sunlit hospital room. “The 1-Minute Kiss” (Episode 14) \nEpisode 14, which also featured the sweet hug mentioned above, ended with a bang as the two characters kissed for the first time in a long while. Yoo Yeon Seok gave Seo Hyun Jin a necklace for Christmas, and personally clasped it around her neck with a heartfelt confession after she initially refused. Their kiss was tentative at first, but notable for Seo Hyun Jin finally accepting his advances after trying to avoid it for so long. “I Love You” (Episode 15) \nEpisode 15 featured some comic moments as Yoo Yeon Seok and Seo Hyun Jin play-fought over whether to reveal their relationship to their hospital colleagues. Seo Hyun Jin staunchly denied all questions about their relationship, but Yoo Yeon Seok was more teasing, even breaking out the fated “I love you” in the middle of a public space. Flustered, she tried to block his mouth to prevent anyone else from hearing, but the words had been said. “Fake Fight” (Episode 15) \nIn order to fool their hospital colleagues, especially Im Won Hee (who witnessed the fatal moment mentioned above), the couple decided to stage a fake fight. In the emergency room, they started shouting at each other, all the while slyly looking around to see other people’s reactions. Despite their “hard work,” Im Won Hee told Byun Woo Min , “It’s a fake.” This moment got the highest ratings in all of Episode 15. \nWhat were your favorite moments from the couple? \nWatch the latest episode of “Romantic Doctor Kim” below!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T01:13:25.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
