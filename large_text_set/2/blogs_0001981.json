File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - Russian companies have expressed interest to invest in the country’s infrastructure landscape, particularly in transport systems and power plants, the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) said. \nPCCI said it met recently with a delegation sent by the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation. \n“The Russian delegates discussed the capacity of Russian companies to participate in infra projects like transport systems and power plants,” the country’s largest business group said. \n“Mentioning that they have industrial projects in ASEAN countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, the Russians sought chamber assistance to get to know how business works in the Philippines and an orientation on the process of breaking into the Philippine markets,” the PCCI added. \nThe Philippine government and Russia likewise held discussions last week during the co-chairs’ meeting of the Philippines–Russia Joint Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation (JCTEC) in a move to forge closer economic cooperation and strengthen two-way bilateral trade and investment relations. \nThe JCTEC is the primary bilateral mechanism for both sides to discuss ways to enhance trade, investments and economic cooperation.   \n“The JCTEC complements the administration’s policy to engage other countries in the Asia Pacific region. The engagement has generated strong private sector interest and we see great prospects for collaboration in many areas,” Trade Undersecretary Ceferino Rodolfo said. \nThe inaugural session of the JCTEC is scheduled to convene in the first half of the year in Manila in preparation for the visit of President Duterte to Russia. \nThe PCCI said it will help in gathering the Philippine delegation accompanying Duterte in his state visit to Moscow.
