The 20-year-old character defends garments such as the hijab and abaya, states that she will become a man’s second wife, and then declares Western clothing is “horribly immodest.” \nParent Dean Hohl attended a New Albany-Floyd County school board meeting on the matter and said that his child’s assignment was similar to “describing how effective Hitler was at nationalizing Germany and creating patriotism but leaving out that he slaughtered 6 million Jews,” the USA Today-affiliated Courier-Journal reported Tuesday. “Let’s tell the whole truth.” \nAnother parent, Jon Baker, said the document is “almost propaganda.” \n“If you read that, you would think everything’s wonderful in that world,” he said. \nBill Briscoe, a spokesman for the district, told the newspaper that a review of the curriculum is underway. \nThe assignment, which was created by Sharon Coletti of InspirEd Educators Inc., caused a similar uproar in 2011 at a middle school in Smyrna, Georgia. She told the newspaper that anger is unwarranted in part because the worksheet also includes an Israeli woman who served in the army and plans to attend college. \n“If I can shape something so that kids have to decide for themselves, once I get them involved in the situation, they never forget it,” she said. \nThe former educator said she would discontinue the worksheet to avoid further controversy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T03:25:13.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
