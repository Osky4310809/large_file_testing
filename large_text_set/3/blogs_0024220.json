José Rodriguez, a Democrat said, during arguments against the bill Tuesday, according to The Houston Chronicle. \nSen. Brandon Creighton, the Republican who introduced SB 25, has adamantly rejected the idea that it allows doctors to purposely withhold information about the health of a fetus. “Nothing in this bill relieves a physician of any negligent behavior,” Creighton told The Blaze on March 14th . “The bill does not permit a physician to lie.”\nHowever, when Creighton originally introduced the bill, he stated that “It is unacceptable that doctors can be penalized for embracing the sanctity of life.”\nSupporters of the bill say that it protects doctors from “wrongful birth” lawsuits. These lawsuits, though extremely rare, have been filed when a doctor has failed to diagnose a birth defect that may have influenced a mother’s decision to continue with the pregnancy.\nThe “wrongful birth” legal issue dates back to a 1975 Supreme Court Case, Jacobs v. Theimer. Dortha Jean Jacobs contracted rubella during her first trimester, giving birth to a child with defective organs — and the parent’s medical bills totaled more than $21,000 by 1973.\nJacobs and her husband sued Dr. Louis M. Theimer on grounds that she failed to diagnose the rubella and inform them of potential long-term risks to the fetus. The Supreme Court sided with Jacobs, awarding her family the funds needed to care for the child’s impairment.\nIn describing the Supreme Court precedent, Sen. Creighton stated that “there are no wrongful births,” according to CNN.com. \n“SB 25 would allow doctors to lie to their patients,” Heath Busby, executive director at NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, told RollingStone.com. “Pregnant Texans deserve to feel like they can trust their doctor to provide them with all the information, and when the doctor does not do that, those families deserve to have a legal avenue to seek compensation to care for special needs children.”\nAnother bill, SB415, passed the Texas state Senate with the same margin Monday. The bill would ban “dilation and evacuation” abortions, the most common surgical abortion procedure for women in their second trimester of pregnancy.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:19:54.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
