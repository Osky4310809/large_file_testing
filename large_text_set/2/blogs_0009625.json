At Sunday’s Grammy Awards, Schoolboy Q took the red carpet in a pink sweatshirt that read “Girl Power” — the perfect piece to complement the outfit of his daughter, Joyce — a pink Gucci tux with a matching pink shirt and floral flourish at the neck. She carried a glittering gold purse to bring the whole look together. Another notable pink pantsuit look came from none other than Blue Ivy Carter, who rocked hers with a white ruffled blouse. She carried her essentials in a sparkly pink, cat-shaped purse. Blue Ivy Carter poses with her father, Jay Z, at the 2017 Grammy Awards.   Blue Ivy wore a shirt like the one Joyce rocked at the Grammys for an impromptu photoshoot with her aunt, Solange Knowles months ago. Joyce and Blue Ivy sat right near each other at the Grammys! (Photo: CBS) More Blue, who was seated near Joyce at the Grammys, didn’t look too impressed by the evening. Photos of her posing with her father, Jay Z, revealed the 5-year-old looking very stern and about her business — and, quite frankly, like she just wanted to be left alone. Her look of annoyance pretty much captured what anyone would feel with a bunch of cameras shoved into her face while simply trying to watch a show.

Either way, both little ladies looked great, and if this is what the future of pantsuit nation looks like, it’s shaping up to be a bright (pink!) one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:23:30.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
