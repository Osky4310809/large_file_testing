He’s a former Marine, a killer chef, a James Beard award winner, and overall, a true Renaissance man. (He once showed up at our office at 10 AM with a bunch of shrimp remoulade in a Mason jar, just because.) \nSo when Besh says that Trout Amandine is his favorite dish, out of all of the incredible Creole cuisine that he grew up eating, you know it’s something special. \n“I would smell the almonds in the brown butter throughout the house,” he recalls, before casually mentioning that the scent of “toasted almonds are the first sign of a chemical attack, and if you smell this, you’ll probably be dead within 15 minutes.” \nNo matter. This dish will kill absolutely no one besides the unfortunate fish that comprises its centerpiece—a delicious trout, of course. \nBut this recipe is special because it’s packed with Creole seasoning—paprika, garlic, onion, cayenne, allspice—and has the distinctly French touch of beautiful sliced almonds (and of course, lots and lots of butter).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:11:54.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
