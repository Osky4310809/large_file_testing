Burro Bar , the fifth Alpine Restaurant Group restaurant, is ready to start filling Brookline’s Washington Square with tacos, cheese, snacks, and so much more, according to Boston Magazine . The doors opened at 1665 Beacon St. at 5 p.m. today, January 30. Though the menu is smaller than at Burro Bar’s older sibling, Painted Burro in Somerville, it features some familiar favorites, with quite a bent toward tacos. There’s a beef tongue taco, as well as a chorizo de la casa version, plus tacos with a range of other meat and seafood fillings. Burro Bar also has a section of small bites and quesos fundidos, or cheesy dips, on the menu. (See the full menu below.)
