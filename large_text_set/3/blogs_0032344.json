That poster, and one featuring Radix in a similar pose, shared a “similarity of expression” sufficient survive Marvel and Disney’s motion to dismiss, the judge said.\nThe Lai brothers said they created their Radix character in 2001 at a time when Iron Man, who first appeared in 1963, was still “wearing simple spandex-like attire and minimal armor.”\n“It was not until after the Lai brother’s submitted their work in Radix … that Marvel began depicting Iron Man wearing the suits,” their lawsuit claimed. ​​\nJudge Oetken agreed that the two characters had similarities, but he said that there were too many differences to let overall copyright claim move forward.\nJudge Oetken also tossed that claim because of the barrier to copyrighting something as broad as a mechanized suit of armor.\nA lawyer for the defendants, which also includes Paramount Pictures Corp., declined to comment.\n\n \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:09:38.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
