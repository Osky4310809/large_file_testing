Fr. Ejike Mbaka, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle the high level of hunger in the country in 2017. \nIn a sermon during the New Year eve service, Mbaka disclosed that it had been difficult for men of God to reach Buhari to offer him advice, “because of the kind of people around him”. \nMbaka, however, said Buhari needed to know that Nigerians expect more changes in the New Year. The priest said the President should not concentrate only on corruption and security. \nHe advised Buhari to also address hunger, and satisfy the peoples’ yearning for change. \n“Many Nigerians are suffering, though the President is trying on corruption and security, Nigerians are hungry. They want to see more changes. There is the need to assist businessmen and women in their businesses,” Mbaka said. \nHe also advised the President to appoint experts who would help him to revive the economy. \nMbaka also asked the President to consult religious leaders and eminent men of God to advise him and tell him the truth about the economy. \n“We (men of God) cannot reach him for advice because of the kind of people around him,” Mbaka said. \nHowever, the presiding Bishop of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission, Bishop Mike Okonkwo, has said that there will be more troubles this year for treasury looters and for those who want to destabilise Nigeria as well as those who had been troubling the nation. \nHe stated that the war against corruption would be heightened, while people who looked up to God would experience a positive turnaround in their lives. \nOkonkwo spoke to journalists in Lagos during the crossover night service on Saturday. \nHe urged President Muhammadu Buhari to stop being silent over killings and other forms of injustice against innocent citizens in any part of the country. \nThe cleric warned that people would soon lose confidence in Buhari’s government if the President continued to keep mum while violence was being unleashed on innocent citizens in some parts of the country. \nHe described the recent killings in Southern Kaduna as sad and condemnable. \nThe cleric called for dialogue among the different agitators in the country and the Federal Government, saying that dialogue rather than violence was the solution to such issues. \nHe also reiterated his call for the restructuring and decentralisation of the country. \nAccording to him, true federalism will reduce over-concentration of power and resources at the federal level, while the respective entities would develop at their own pace. \nHe stated that some people were feeling marginalised, adding that every segment of Nigeria should be given confidence that they still belong in the nation. \nHe also said there was nothing wrong for Buhari to either rejig his cabinet or appoint new people that could help to move the nation forward. \nOkonkwo said, “There will be more problems for those who have looted the treasury in this country in 2017. There is also enormous hope for turnaround for people who will come to God for solution. \n“I know that presently those who have, one way or the other, destabilised the country, there will be more problem for them. There will be a demand from government that they should return the money they looted. \n“There will be more demands; so problems will be enormous for those who have been troubling this nation over the years. But for those who look unto God, there is a turnaround. They will experience God in a new way because God himself will do certain things that ordinarily human mind cannot comprehend. 2017 is a year of new things.” \nHe added, “One of the challenges the Federal Government is presently having is that they (Buhari and members of his government) are not speaking as they should speak. My advice to them is if Nigerians will continue to have confidence in them, they should speak out on what they are doing, what are the challenges they are passing through; and the solutions they are expecting?. These are some of the things that will make people to have confidence in them. \n“Presently, people are losing confidence in the government. For instance, the issue of the Southern Kaduna, we expected the Federal Government to have said something about it; but they are not saying anything. So, people in the country have the feeling that the government is giving tacit support to what is going on. So, they must come out plainly and tell the citizens what they are doing. If they don’t, people will lose confidence in government.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T05:00:11.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
