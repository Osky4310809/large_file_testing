The stations features installments from artist Vik Muniz's project Perfect Strangers , a series of life-size mosaic portraits of everyday New Yorkers.\nAmongst the beautifully intricate artwork depicted on the walls of the station is a mural of two gay men — an IRL married couple — holding hands.\nSEE ALSO: It took 100 years and 1 inspirational video for new NYC subway line to launch\nThe mosaic was inspired by a photograph taken more than three years ago in Brooklyn of Thor Stockman, 60, and his husband of three and a half years, Patrick Kellogg, 47.\nEarlier this year, when the couple was told their image would be featured as part of Muniz's installation in the the 72nd Street subway station, they were overjoyed. \"It was like winning the lottery,\" Stockman said about the opportunity.\nBut while excited to have his love shown to the city, he also explained, \"part of me wishes that it wasn't a rarity, that it wasn't remarkable.\"\nThor Stockman, above, and Patrick Kellogg pose for a picture while holding a copy of the photograph that was used to create a mosaic of them in the new subway in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2016.\nImage: Seth Wenig/ap photo\nAn image of a gay couple showing affection is somewhat uncommon in today's public art scene, and the couple said their loved ones saw it as a great stride for the community.\n\"Our friends were happy that this is gay representation on the walls of New York City, but our friends were even happier that this is gay representation that is not incredibly beautiful and skinny,\" Kellogg said. Stockman added, \"That they were just average-looking guys like us.\"\nMuniz said it made sense to include the mosaic of the two men in his project, because his intention was to show all the different people that commute on subways daily. \"They are just people you would expect to see,\" Muniz told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \"You would expect to see men holding hands.\"\nA mural by Vik Muniz on the wall of the Second Avenue subway station at 72nd Street in New York. The subjects are Thor Stockman, left, and his husband, Patrick Kellogg.\nImage: New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority via AP\nAccording to Jonathan David Katz , an expert in queer art history, this mosaic serves as the first permanent, non-political LGBTQ public artwork in the city of New York.\nIn both the gay community and the world of art, \"What makes it a turning point is it isn't gayness singled out and made the theme,\" Katz said. \"On the contrary, the work naturalizes gayness within the fabric of the city, and in so doing, that's actually an even more powerful message.\"\nIn addition to Muniz, three other artists have their work featured at the various stations on the subway line.\nThe Associated Press contributed additional reporting.\nBONUS: Electric cargo bike vs subway", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q8KwOu6vD0fL86pY8dA1hIXMd10=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F334029%2Ff2d1d025-7be1-4107-bba9-7804860164dc.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/x3PKgAWMrabDKDn1MVipZ81skX4=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F334029%2Ff2d1d025-7be1-4107-bba9-7804860164dc.jpg", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/77a4344b188c4c089742fb051238dfba/new-subway-station-has-public-art-rarely-seen-gay-couple", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nwxAjePts-9huDnEbpkp4E3qD5Q=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F334027%2F3d9978a2-cf6f-482e-9fa3-c916d054a048.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/kzlsL1qi.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lhDQr-ePFKjPLp1KvuDKUcIg9xg=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F334027%2F3d9978a2-cf6f-482e-9fa3-c916d054a048.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/kzlsL1qi.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-03T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T01:18:42.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
