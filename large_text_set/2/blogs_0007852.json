The Mouse House reeled in $15.2 billion in revenue and earnings of $1.63 a share for the corresponding period a year earlier, which included one of the biggest movies ever, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” \nAnalysts had estimated $15.3 billion in revenue and earnings of $1.50 a share on average for the most recent quarter.

As cheaper TV alternatives began to proliferate, ESPN hemorrhaged subscribers during the course of 2016 and is now at less than 88 million , compared with a peak of 100.1 million in 2011. At an estimated $7 per subscriber, that dip has been a substantial hit to Disney, especially considering media networks made up 49 percent of Disney’s profits during fiscal 2016. \nAt the same time, rights fees for the live sports ESPN specializes in broadcasting continue to go up, as there’s plenty of competition for one of the few pieces of programmed television that still delivers monster ratings. ESPN will pay $7.3 billion for content this year – the biggest price tag among all media companies. Operating income at Disney’s cable networks division — primarily ESPN — plunged 11 percent compared with the same time the previous year. Disney attributed that drop entirely to lower ESPN revenue. Also Read: 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' Hits $1 Billion Worldwide \nThe timing of this year’s college football playoff games — always among ESPN’s highest-rated broadcasts — also wasn’t favorable. Three of the games occurred during the company’s fiscal first quarter compared with six last year, accounting for part of the drop. However, Disney also identified declining subscribers as a contributing factor in its earnings report. \nOn the other hand, Disney’s film division had a record 2016, becoming the only studio in history to gross more than $7 billion in a single year at the international box office and $3 billion domestically. Disney also had four of the five highest-grossing films at the domestic box office last year. After a mid-year lull , which was reflected in its last earnings report, Disney regrouped for the holiday season behind “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” which has already blasted its way past $1 billion worldwide — but the studio couldn’t match its banner haul from last holiday season. \nParks and resorts was the Mouse House’s best-performing division, and the only to report year-over-year gains in revenue and profit. Behind new attractions at home and the opening of Shanghai Disneyland Park in June, the division reported a 6 percent increase in revenue and a 13 percent jump in profit. 14 Live-Action Disney Movies in the Works Based on Animated Classics, From 'Mulan' to 'Snow White' (Photos) \nDisney will be pumping out live-action versions of its animated classics for a long time to come. Here's a list of titles in the works, including the release date of the original. \nBeauty and the Beast (1991) The next live-action reboot stars Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Josh Gad and voices such as Emma Thompson, and hits theaters onMarch 17, 2017. Disney \nThe Lion King (1994) Director Jon Favreau transplanted to Disney after proving himself a major player with Marvel's \"Iron Man.\" Then Favreau knocked \"The Jungle Book\" out of the park in spring 2016. Getty / Disney \nMaleficent Adapted from 1959's \"Sleeping Beauty,\" the movie helped energize Angelina Jolie's career and introduced an entire generation to the tale's terrifying villain. A sequel is in the works. Disney \nAladdin (1992) This whimsical and critically acclaimed journey catapulted Robin Williams into four-quadrant comedy stardom thanks to his take on the genie in Aladdin’s lamp. Now the colorful and gritty director Guy Ritchie will try his hand at a reboot. Disney \nMulan (1998) This is a particularly anticipated title, already slated for release on November 2, 2018. The title character has not yet been cast (and there's plenty of controversy about that). It has a script by Elizabeth Martin and Lauren Hynek. Disney \nThe Little Mermaid (1985) \"Mermaid\" is arguably one of the most popular and profitable movies in Disney's vault. The live version has already drafted songwriter Alan Menken and \"Hamilton\" superstar Lin-Manuel Miranda. Getty Images \nCruella Extracted from the famous villainess of 1961’s “One Hundred and One Dalmatians,” this origin story of a woman who declares open season on purebred puppies-- Cruella DeVil -- is set to star Emma Stone. The reigning live-action Cruella is Glenn Close, who herself starred in two live-action adaptations. Getty Images \nJames and the Giant Peach (1996) In one of the more interesting adaptations, this beloved Roald Dahl book became a quirky claymation hit for Disney in 1996 with director Henry Selick. Now, heavy dramatist director Sam Mendes will take a stab at the story. Getty Images \nRose Red This one is trippy (no pun over producer Tripp Vinson), but promising creatively. In the German fairy tale, Rose Red is Snow White's sister. Disney and Vinson are collaborating on introducing the world to the sibling of the famous apple-loving princess. Disney released the original \"Snow White\" in 1937. Disney \nSnow White (1937) Forget her sister -- the original baddest chick in the Disney animated kingdom is coming back for her own standalone film. It was announced at the end of October 2016. Disney \nPeter Pan Neverland will get a practical set if Disney has its way updating the 1953 animated film. Disney \nThe Jungle Book 2 This is a no-brainer follow-up to Favreau's hit from spring 2006, based on the animated classic released in 1967. Disney \nDumbo (1941) In another promising but visually daunting prospect, Tim Burton is developing \"Dumbo,\" about the gentle (and a tad neurotic) performing elephant. Getty Images \nOliver Twist While Disney never formally made a direct animated take on Charles Dickens' beloved orphan, they did release the adorable 1988 \"Oliver and Company,\" inspired by Dickens' tale but told with animals. They also made a small-screen live-action version in 1997 with Richard Dreyfuss.
