This one was for, of all things, an imported 1991 Toyota Sera —a perennial Jalopnik favorite for how it applies incredible Bubble Era weirdness to very humble econocar underpinnings. What kept the tipster from buying? He’s scouring for his daughter’s first car and this doesn’t fit the bill.\n\nFor $8,500, This 1990 Toyota Sera Might Let you Spread Your Wings and Fly For $8,500, This 1990 Toyota Sera Might Let you Spread Your Wings and Fly For $8,500, This 1990 Toyota Sera Might Let you… Red Bull may not literally give you wings but today’s Nice Price or Crack Pipe Toyota Sera will.… Read more Read more \nHere is the ad in question . I wanted to take the time to explain to this gentleman that, yes, in fact, it absolutely does fit the bill and should be his daughter’s first car. Immediately. Post-haste.\nAdvertisement \n\nAdvertisement \n\nAllow me to outline why:\nIt rules. They say the kids aren’t into cars? That’s an ugly lie. But even if they somehow aren’t, this is weird and different enough to get them into cars. His daughter will rule the school. \nIt’s practical. Ideally you’re going to want that first car to be something the kid takes to college or trade school or the Coast Guard or whatever’s next for them in life. This thing has four seats OR a big hatch area when the seats fold down. Think of all the schoolbooks and weed they could stash back there.\n\nIt’s not as weird as you think. Look, the Sera may look exotic as hell, but it’s a front-wheel drive economy car. It’s a Tercel. It’s a Paseo. It even has the same 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine from those cars and a ton of other Toyotas from that era.
