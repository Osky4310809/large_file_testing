I also love not wearing makeup, giving my skin the freedom to breathe, moisten, detox. When it comes to makeup vs. no makeup, I'm firmly on both sides of the issue.\nMany of you might argue that makeup isn't an \"issue,\" and I agree. As women, we have more important issues to worry about right now, which is why I'm glad that makeup is part of the conversation. Maybe the more we talk about women not wearing makeup, such as Alicia Keys going barefaced at the VMAs and Hillary Clinton wearing little to no makeup in her first post-election appearance, the less it will be newsworthy when a woman opts out of makeup.\nRecent movements such as the Power of Makeup challenge , which encouraged women to share photos with makeup on just one side of their faces, have made me rethink my own relationship with it. The day I arrived at work barefaced for our Power of Makeup photo shoot, I admitted I had become a makeup addict without realizing it.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/DpuDOueS5OhqY9pPSNQ3q9QLWx8/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/20/905/n/1922153/f37dc74bd348e93a_nancy_033_copy.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/fcLMLKT_PrSBfF7dA1xP9EX45Nw/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/20/916/n/1922153/8db14fe7f57e617c_Nancy-Einhart-VP-Executive-Editor.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:16:41.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
