Using an Instagram post and an interview with Blog de Los Angeles by Nunu, Henrie announced that he was engaged on January 27th. The Wizards of Waverly Place actor and his fiancée Maria Cahill will be marrying in April and if that seems fast — well, it really isn’t since the pair has been secretly engaged since October!\nAs Henrie explained in his Instagram post announcing his engagement:\n“I always debated keeping my personal life private or public, but you guys have meant so much to me over the years, I just have to share my JOY #marriage is beautiful. I can not wait.” BIG NEWS I AM HONORED TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU: I'm officially engaged to my best friend :). Link in bio for the story. I always debated keeping my personal life private or public, but you guys have meant so much to me over the years, I just have to share my JOY #marriage is beautiful. I can not wait. \nA photo posted by David Henrie (@davidhenrie) on Jan 27, 2017 at 2:45pm PST \nThey became engaged on October 7th and his proposal sounds over-the-top romantic with a chartered helicopter taking Henrie and Cahill to Catalina Island. His engagement story actually sounds like he was channeling his onscreen dad Ted Mosby from How I Met Your Mother .\nIf you haven’t heard of Cahill, that’s understandable since she isn’t an actor like Henrie. Henrie noted to Blog de Los Angeles that she was a teacher in Delaware when they became engaged in October. However, Cahill has had her own time in the spotlight when Henrie was hanging on TV with Selena Gomez , since she was Miss Delaware 2011 and competed in the Miss America pageant in 2012 .\nI'm #thankful for this one. Here's to you kid. What are you guys thankful for? #gratitude is a virtue. #toothpickOnPoint \nA photo posted by David Henrie (@davidhenrie) on Nov 23, 2016 at 9:09am PST \nWhile we absolutely respect Henrie’s decision to keep his private life private, we are pumped he decided to make his engagement to Cahill public so that we can wish them congratulations on their upcoming wedding. Plus, now that we know he is getting married, it’s time to start speculating wildly about that guest list.\nSurely, Gomez is invited, right?!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:31:27.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
