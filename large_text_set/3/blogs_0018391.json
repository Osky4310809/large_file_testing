It's the Yellow Ranger Trini played by singer and actress Becky G, who you might have seen on YouTube or in her guest role on Empire. \nTGV Cinemas and GSC Cinemas have pulled listings of the show from their websites and TGV Cinemas senior marketing manager Celeste Koay told Channel NewsAsia that the listings were taken down \"to avoid any issues that may arise\". \nSeeing as the film is supposed to open tomorrow, with some shows tonight (Wednesday) it's certainly a last minute decision by the LPF to put the film on hold. Let's see if the film manages to squeeze past the censors this time. \nIn the meantime, here are some other films which (hopefully) won't be put on hold by LPF this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:45:22.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
