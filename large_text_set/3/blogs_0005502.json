Lisovskaya/Thinkstock \nIowa State Sen. Mark Chelgren has said his experience with \"liberal professors\" inspired SF 228, the law he introduced in the Iowa statehouse that would impose a hiring freeze on the state's public universities until the number of Republican and Democrat professors approached equilibrium. \nBut while it's true that professors tend to be liberal, that's not a bias associated with the Forbco Management School, where Chelgren claimed to have received a degree in business management. Advertisement \nIn fact, as Corky Siemaszko reports for NBC News, Forbco is apparently a company that operated a Sizzler steakhouse franchise in Southern California—not a management school, or an educational institution of any kind. \"This was a management course he took when he worked for Sizzler, kind of like Hamburger University at McDonald's,\" a spokesman for the Iowa State Republicans told NBC. \"He got a certificate.\" \nChelgren also claimed he \"attended the University of California at Riverside majoring in astro-physics, geo-physics and mathematics.\" But he only attended that school for a year, NBC reported. He earned an associate's degree in science from Riverside Community College, he told the outlet. \nBefore entering politics, Chelgren was best known as \"Chickenman,\" a fun-loving character who wore a chicken hat, wielded a supersoaker full of beer, and biked naked in Iowa's famous RAGBRAI bike race. \nHenry Grabar is a staff writer for Slate ’s Moneybox.
