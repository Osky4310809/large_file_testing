The difference in the price range of the two areas is fairly stark as well. In Winthrop , an independent town of 17,500 souls (give or take), average asking prices range from $170 to $459. In Eastie , a neighborhood in Boston with roughly 40,500 residents, homes range from $264 to $649. One more caveat re: the data per Valhouli: The owner of the most expensive property in Winthrop, a 3-BR, 2-BA house at 251 Court Street, listed it last year for $1.685M (or $880/foot), and the year before for $1.895M ($990/foot); and then re-listed it with a significant price reduction at $975,000 ($502/foot).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:08:05.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
