Kennedy declared the California presidential primary race is the key to what happens across the county as he opened his campaign bid for the state’s 174 convention votes. \nThe New York senator was greeted by a large and enthusiastic crowds as he made a fast jet plane tour of Northern California yesterday. \nAn estimated 12,000 to 14,000 cheering admirers greeted him at the new Florin Center Mall, the high point of a busy afternoon of campaigning. About 4,000 were on hand at the Sacramento Municipal Airport, where he received a noisy welcome. He spoke earlier in Stockton, addressing about 1,000 at the airport and 5,000 at a downtown rally. \n“What happens in California is the key to what happens across the county,” Kennedy told his Sacramento crowds. “I come here to ask for your help.” \nThe candidate hit hard on such issues as the war in Vietnam, poverty and racial tensions. \nHe was accompanied on the tour by his wife, Ethel, and his sisters, Mrs. Steven E. Smith, wife of his campaign manager, and Mrs. Patricia Lawford, former wife of actor Peter Lawford. \nSpeaker Jesse M. Unruh of the State Assembly was on hand to introduce the senator for each speech. Unruh is chairman of the Kennedy delegation that will be on the June 4 Democratic primary ballot, along with that of U.S. Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota, and Atty. Gen. Thomas C.

Thousands were turned away. \nAs early as 5:30 o’clock the crowd began to gather on the broad steps at the J Street entrance. The management opened the doors at 6:15 and there was a grand rush for seats. By 7:15 there was standing room only. The crowd become so dense that it was necessary for a squad of policemen to clear the aisles and passageways. \nLater the great crowd was treated to a beautiful and inspiring sight when a clack curtain went up revealing nearly a thousand singers and members of the symphony orchestra seated on bleachers at the rear of the stage. \nSacramento Bee file 1892 charter divides the city into nine wards \nMarch 1892: A commission elected by voters in 1891 completes its work on a new Sacramento city charter. \nThe charter divides the city into nine wards, each with its own member on the Board of Education and the Board of Trustees (later the City Council). \nIt calls for the independent election of the mayor, who has the power to appoint various city officials, including the police and fire chiefs.
