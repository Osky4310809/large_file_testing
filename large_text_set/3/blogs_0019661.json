I mean, I think it was but I honestly can't even remember anymore.\nAll I know is that my stomach is full of butterflies and my heart is racing because on Tuesday afternoon, Ventimiglia blessed his Twitter followers by revealing a trove of tech-related confessions, ultimately revealing himself as a hardcore Apple fanboy.\nWho. Would. Have. Guessed.\nSEE ALSO: Milo Ventimiglia couldn't finish reading 'The Fountainhead,' either \nThough Ventimiglia has captured the hearts of basically everyone in his recent role of Jack in This Is Us , most of his ride-or-die fans (me) fell in love with him when he played the angsty, book-loving Jess Mariano on Gilmore Girls in 2001 (or even before that breakout role). \nThis means we knew him before we knew Apple, before we knew iPhones, and really, before tech ran our lives. So seeing him pledge his loyalty to a modern day tech company is just ~woah~. \nAnywho, back to the tweets. \nTweet 1: The AirPods Got a prime parking spot and a welcome sign pullin in....Love you too ;) #ThisIsUs #TuesdayLoveStill . MV pic.twitter.com/cKLDpytQMZ \n‚Äî Milo Ventimiglia (@MiloVentimiglia) March 21, 2017 \nOn Tuesday afternoon, Milo, being the adorable and tame little guy that he is, stopped in a parking lot to squat and take a selfie next to the trunk of a Volvo. As one does.\nWhy? Well, because he got a \"prime parking spot and a welcome sign\" when he pulled into the lot and wanted to give his fans a shout-out. He posed with a \"LVUJACK\" license plate ‚Äî which obviously references his This Is Us character, Jack, and nothing else in this world.\nThis was very cute. But the real takeaway here is that Milo is sporting Apple AirPods in this picture, which means he uses AirPods and AirPods...are...COOL. \nTweet 2: Milo is down to do an Apple commercial As Milo fans across the world debated whether or not the actor was blasting \" Death With Dignity \" by Sufjan Stevens, or IDK, maybe some Bj√∂rk on his AirPods, Mashable Business Reporter Emma Hinchliffe tweeted the question on everyone's mind:\nWhen will Milo Ventimiglia get his own Apple commercial https://t.co/heS4FC6AQ4 \n‚Äî Emma Hinchliffe (@_emmahinchliffe) March 21, 2017 \nBecause Milo loves Apple so much, he swiftly answered her question, and we know it came from him because he signed the tweet with his classic \"MV\" signature. üòç\n\"They doing those?\" he asked about the commercials before explaining he'd love to be featured in one. He pledged his loyalty to the tech company and asked if Apple is on board with this brilliant plan.\nThey doing those? Love to. I'm @Apple through and through. What do you think @Apple ? MV https://t.co/eTNCw9Hsoo \n‚Äî Milo Ventimiglia (@MiloVentimiglia) March 21, 2017 \nApple, you up?\nTweet 3: Milo's forgotten Apple commercial Milo acted like he was totally down to make a commercial with Apple, which led us all to believe he had never made one, but Kevin T. Porter, star of the legendary Gilmore Guys podcast, seems to remember otherwise.\nPorter replied to Milo's tweet explaining that, though it may have slipped the actor's memory, a young Ventimiglia had already given a riveting Apple commercial performance in the past. He even LINKED. THE. VIDEO.\nIf you take any shred of joy away from 2017, let it be Milo's forgotten Apple commercial, \"Cool Plane Guy.\" The greatest minute-long comedic yet dramatic cinematic production you may ever lay eyes on, with Milo showing off his brand new iBook on an airplane and jamming out to the hit 2000 anthem \" Who Let The Dogs Out \".\n@MiloVentimiglia @_emmahinchliffe You already did one my man. Time for @Apple to bring back ‚ÄúCool Plane Guy‚Äù! https://t.co/YKTjenHRyc \n‚Äî Kevin T.
