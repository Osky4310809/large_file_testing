He gave an awe-inspiring, heart-warming, super inspirational speech which will push you to follow your dreams, just like he did. Despite lack of support from his parents, and no godfather in the industry, he has become Bollywood's most revered designer. Here are excerpts from the speech: \"My entire childhood was movies, movies, and movies. I was fascinated by (their) colour, by the clothes, the music. I used to look at Yash Chopra's films and wonder, \"Will I ever go to a five-star hotel and have a meal?\" A post shared by Manish Malhotra (@manishmalhotra05) on Feb 12, 2017 at 3:30pm PST A post shared by Manish Malhotra (@manishmalhotra05) on Feb 11, 2017 at 10:33am PST \n\"I always thought, would I ever be over there? Go for such parties, meet film stars; would I have this kind of lifestyle? Would I make a noise in this world, in this entire big world? So with those dreams I came into college.\" A post shared by Manish Malhotra (@manishmalhotra05) on Feb 10, 2017 at 5:08pm PST \n\"When I was in college, one day someone offered me this modelling assignment and I was like, ‘I can model? Are you sure?' So, they said, ‘you can', and I was very excited with that and I started modelling. At the age of 19 I told my father, ‘I haven't even been abroad, I want to see the world. Otherwise how will I make something out of my life?' So he was like, ‘you are modelling, save your money and then go if you want to'. That's when I worked really hard as a model and I used to take up every assignment.\"\"I used to not meet my friends, I used to be shooting every second day, taking every assignment that came to me so I could travel abroad. In those days, I managed to save some Rs 90,000 and I went to Singapore and Bangkok for the first time, really proud that I could do this on my own.\" A post shared by Manish Malhotra (@manishmalhotra05) on Feb 6, 2017 at 10:49pm PST \n\"I took up a job at a boutique as a sales boy. My parents were absolutely horrified, they were like, ‘What are you doing? You are going to become a tailor, why are you a sales boy? Why don't you join your father's air conditioning business?' I was like, ‘No, I'm going to be a film director'.\"\"I was in this boutique and I was a sales boy but I took it on and I used to sit with the tailor. I used to learn about cuts. I was very curious. I used to ask questions. I used to meet with the clients. I used to sketch all day long. I used to dress up the mannequin.\" A post shared by Manish Malhotra (@manishmalhotra05) on Feb 5, 2017 at 9:14am PST \n\"I kept two machines in my house, I had two tailors in my bedroom. I started with taking orders for salwaar kameez and my mother was horrified. She was like I can't believe I'm going to tell my friends that my son takes salwaar kameez orders, come and give him orders. I was like no, there is something better [coming] out of this.\"\"I started with, ‘What is going to be your make-up and what is going to be your hair?' All the make-up artists used to be like, ‘why is this costume designer interfering in our make-up and hair?'\" A post shared by Manish Malhotra (@manishmalhotra05) on Feb 11, 2017 at 4:43am PST \n\"And (then) came Rangeela and Raja Hindustani . And the ‘makeover' happened. [It was] not that planned, yet all of us wanted to do something fabulous, wanted to work and change the way films looked and in 1995. Filmfare Awards for the first time ever gave a Costume Designer Award and that was to me for the film Rangeela . From there, it all started.\"\"I have to say (to) all of you here, that I think the best education has been travel-learning, imbibing, watching people, watching different cultures.\" A post shared by Manish Malhotra (@manishmalhotra05) on Feb 11, 2017 at 4:00am PST \n\"I was already working with the best of directors, producers, actresses and actors. Then came the very prestigious Birla family couple-Yash and Avanti Birla who offered me a retail store and I was like ‘retail?!'\"\"I moved on to launch my new label, which was in the year 2006, and two-three years went balancing, you know, movies and my own label. This was when for the first time I introduced the concept of a show-stopper. Fashion critics criticised me [saying] all my fashion shows had a very impressive film industry front row, which was not really a norm in fashion in those days, neither was a showstopper. But, after 11 years today, actors are paid to be showstoppers and everybody looks at having a good front row.\" Image Source: Picture Credit: DNAIndia", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:57:35.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
