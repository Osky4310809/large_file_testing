The bike was made as part of a competition run by German magazine Custombike, of which Zernia was one of the three finalists.\nThe stone is basalt, mined from the Eifel mountain range a short distance from Zernia’s home. In total, the CX500 now weighs 355 kilos, which is still considerably lighter than bikes such as the Harley Road Glide.\nSince the crafting of the CX500, Zernia also plans to aim for a Guinness World Record for the fastest motorcycle ever made by making a Harley Sportster out of basalt.\nElsewhere, it looks like the iconic Game Boy may be resurrected in the form of Retro Bit’s Super Retro Boy.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T11:58:58.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
