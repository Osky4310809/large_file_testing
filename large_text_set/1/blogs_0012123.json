I did a lot of work in that week to try and band-aid myself up and get it sorted, but on the second day in Qatar it just flamed up again.” media_camera Price on his way to victory in Abu Dhabi last year. \nThe withdrawal came with an eye to ensure his body was ready for the rigours of pursuing a second Dakar title. \n“For sure, I could’ve kept going and been in the top five and survived the event,” he said. \n“Or it could’ve caused more damage and then I would have to take another 12 months off to get ready — or band-aid myself up for Dakar, and you definitely don’t want to be doing that. \n“I think if I’d got a fourth or better at Qatar, that would’ve been a world championship for me (in 2016) as well. \n“It’s a little bit of a hard pill to swallow once you see how the rest of the year worked out, but things happen for a reason. I think we made the right choice.” media_camera Price after winning the final round of last year’s world championship in Morocco. \nWhether Price will be fit for duty remains to be seen but it would be a brave person to bet against him giving it a good crack. \nWhen Price broke three vertebrae in a race crash in April 2013 doctors were astonished the injuries had not rendered him a quadriplegic. Just five months later he was back on a motorbike. \nBack to back rounds again kick off the 2017 FIM Cross Country Rallies World Championship, with the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge on April 1-7 followed a week later by the Sealine Cross-Country Rally in Qatar on April 16-21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T07:59:00.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
