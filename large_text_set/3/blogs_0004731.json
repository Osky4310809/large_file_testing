It's the league itself. In every Premier League game you have to be at 100 per cent for 90 minutes or you lose,\" said Bale, as quoted by The Sun . \n\"Spanish teams definitely know they have this edge over English teams. I think every country does. Spain, Italy, Germany – they all have a winter break. \n\"Also in Spain, you can be up at half-time against the bottom club and you can take your foot off the gas. You can take people off. \nWATCH: Zidane shows neat touch \n\"If you try for only 45 minutes you won't win a match in the Premier League. Obviously, we still play but it's not at the same 110 per cent intensity. \n\"And the winter break is massive. In England you'll play four or five games and we don't play any. You don't get many rest days and it really does burn you out for a long time.\" \nWhile he still marvels at the competitive edge in the Premier League, Bale believes the sharp end of La Liga, with the likes of Atletico Madrid and Europa League champions Sevilla pushing Madrid and Clasico rivals Barcelona, boasts a superior quality of football. \n\"In terms of one-to-20 the Premier League is the closest. On any given day, 20th can beat top. Here, not so much. It's a bigger gap. \nHow Madrid tried to sign Maradona \n\"But I feel the top six or seven in Spain is really strong and in European competition you've obviously got Real Madrid and Barcelona, Atletico Madrid have been to two finals and Sevilla have won the three Europa Leagues. \n\"The Premier League is by far the most competitive - but the teams that always perform in Europe are from Spain.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T08:59:11.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
