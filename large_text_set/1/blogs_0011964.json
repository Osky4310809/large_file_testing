The call occurred the next day, Spicer said. He denied that it had anything to do with the sanctions. \nSpicer said there was nothing unusual about the call, but White House officials told NBC News it was not coordinated with them. It is unclear how the U.S. government became aware of the call, which was first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who said there were multiple calls and raised the question of whether the conversations violated the \"spirit\" of a law that bars private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.
