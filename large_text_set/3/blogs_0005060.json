You have limited time to download and install it. Download Now Silver Key Standard 4.9.0 Terms and conditions \nIf you need to send sensitive data over the Internet you should encrypt it first. But what about the other side? The recipient will probably not like the idea of buying and learning some software just to decrypt your file. No problem here if you are using Silver Key. \nRight-click the file or folder you wish to send and select the \"Create EXE Parcel\" command. Silver Key compresses and encrypts your data and adds a small decryptor program. Your correspondent does not need to install any decrypting program because the parcel already contains all the needed software. \nIf your demands are higher, you can use the Silver Key Parcel Designer to create more advanced encrypted parcels. You can add encrypted and unencrypted comments, create shortcuts on the target computer, request opening a file after decryption, and even include an uninstaller. \nPlease note: the download archive includes the Portable USB version as well!   2000/ Server 2003/ XP/ Server 2008/ Vista/ 7/ 8/ Server 2012 (x32/x64) Publisher:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:18:06.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
