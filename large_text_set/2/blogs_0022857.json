Maxine Waters: Trump Administration \"A Bunch Of Scumbags\" | Posted By Ian Schwartz On Date February 22, 2017 \nRep. Maxine Waters (D-California) calls President Trump's friends and advisors with ties to Russia and oil and gas interests \"a bunch of scumbags.\" Waters, in her more than two-minute screed, accused Trump cabinet members like Rex Tillerson of wanting to lift sanctions so his former employer Exxon-Mobile can benefit. Waters also theorized that the Trump administration will help pull \"Soviet countries\" back into the sphere of the \"Soviet Union.\" \"I just think the American people had better understand what's going on,\" Waters said. \"This is a bunch of scumbags. That's what they are.\" REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Can't people see what's going on? Why do you think they hacked into our election? They hacked into the election because they have to make sure that Donald Trump got elected. So that he could help them with what I think is a huge deal. Not only to lift these sanctions, but to take over all of these Soviet countries and pull them back into the Soviet Union so that they can have access to all of these resources. It's clear to me. And I just think the American people had better understand what's going on. This is a bunch of scumbags. That's what they are -- CHRIS HAYES: Those are very strong words, Congresswoman. WATERS: -- They're all organized by making money. HAYES: Who do you mean that when you call them scumbags? Who are you talking about? WATERS: All of these people that are organized with these oil and gas interests that's in the administration and friends of the president of the United States. This back channeling that you see. These are a bunch of scumbags, that's what they are. HAYES: You mean the Secretary of State of the United States? WATERS: Well, I tell you this, Tillerson is there to get these sanctions lifted. I believe it, just watch him. He's going to continue to work on it. This is important for him. He was there because he negotiated the deal for Exxon with Putin.
