Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWhatever you make of his dad's policies and relationship with the truth , the fact is Barron Trump is just a 10 year-old boy. \nIn the wake of Friday's presidential inauguration, The White House's 'first boy' since JFK junior has been subjected to cruel online taunts and even speculation that he is autistic. \nSaturday Night Live writer Katie Rich attracted harsh criticism for a tweet she later deleted which read, \"Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter.\" \nRich's comment was just one of many singling out the boy, who must now spend the next four years largely scrutinised under the spotlight. \nThere are a handful of people who know exactly what this is like, and one in particular leaped to Barron's defense. First daughter Chelsea Clinton issued a defense on behalf of all children (Photo: REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) \nChelsea Clinton took to her social media accounts to express her anger at the abuse levelled at Donald and Melania's son. \"Barron Trump deserves the chance every child does - to be a kid,\" she wrote. \nThe mother-of-two and former first daughter also took the opportunity to remind her followers that, \"Standing up for every kid also means opposing POTUS policies that hurt kids.\" \nThe post has attracted as much praise for standing up for Barron as it has criticism for \"hypocrisy.\" \nOne response on Twitter read, \"Your mother lost. We don't want her nonsense in our nations politics.\" \nThis was, predictably, just one of many. Read More Donald Trump posts embarrassing spelling mistake in one of first tweets as President - then quickly deletes it \nHowever, many supported her statement. \nAnitha Bachireddy responded with, \"Thank you, Chelsea. Exactly what a woman who grew up in the White House should say. \n\"You are the finest product of an American Presidential legacy. I am your age and grew up with you and thought you were just like me and people should leave you alone.\" \n\"Kids are off limits,\" agreed another supporter. \"Barron deserves to be left out of the fray. He didn't ask to be thrown into this kind of spotlight. Thank you, Chelsea. You went through it yourself, and it's not fair!\" Read More White House website already promoting Melania Trumpâ€™s jewellery line just hours after her husband was inaugurated \nChelsea was herself the victim of brutal comments while her father was in office. \nIn 1993 when she was just 13 years-old, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh mocked her appearance saying, \"Socks is the White House cat. But did you know there is also a White House dog?\" before showing an image of the young Clinton.
