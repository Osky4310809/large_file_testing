The release began in September. Mods are also available for sale in the US, like the JBL speaker or Hasselblad camera. Lenovo Moto Z Play design and build quality \nIt's hard not to notice the Moto Z Play. The latest Lenovo is indeed a pretty awesome smartphone in terms of its dimensions (156.4 x 76.4 x 7 mm), although it is heavier than its counterparts. The smartphone is not ugly either. It's classic and looks like the Moto Z (the screen is the same size, i.e. 5.5 inches), except it is much thicker. The differences between the two devices are few, the only glaring difference is that the front flash is not on the same side. Can you spot the differences? / © AndroidPIT \nThe weight gain has its advantages. It enables it to bring back the 3.5mm mini-jack (because a mini-jack is apparently now an advantage) and include a bigger 3,510 mAh battery, which performs quite well (more on that later). The mini-jack is on the back. / © AndroidPIT \nHowever, the camera is on the rear panel and sticks out a bit, which is not aesthetically pleasing. To remedy this, Lenovo offers Moto Style Shells, which are about 2 mm thick. The one that comes in the box provides a textile-like feel but Motorola gives you other options with many materials, textures and fabrics. Customization fanatics can change the style at any time, and quite quickly. The other advantage of this mod is it protects the connectors for mods on the back of the smartphone. You can customize the Moto Z Play. / © AndroidPIT \nAs far as material goes, the Moto Z Play flows seamlessly from metal to glass (Gorilla Glass 4). This makes it very a nice phone to hold but it collects fingerprints easily. \nAt the front, there is the fingerprint reader. It has no other function since you can't set it up as a home button. Its square shape is similar to the latest devices from Moto. This is something we don't care for. The fingerprint reader does not serve as the home button. / © AndroidPIT \nFinally, on the right side, there are the volume and power buttons. One is serrated so you can distinguish between the two. In practice though, it is difficult to tell the difference. The grooved button is the power button. / © AndroidPIT \nOverall, the Z Play is a stylish smartphone with high-end specs. Its handling is also good for those who like phablets. And the return of the mini-jack is always appreciated, even in 2016. Lenovo Moto Z Play display \nThe Moto Play Z has a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display. Unlike the Moto Z, which has a QHD screen, the Z Play is Full-HD (1080 x 1920 pixels), with 403 ppi. \nIn my case, I find that Samsung has the best displays. However, Lenovo has done a nice job with the Moto Z Play. The brightness looks good – a bit more would have been good though – and the colors are sharp in 'standard' mode. Generally speaking, you'll be pleased with the Moto Z Play display. The colors of the Moto Play Z are quite saturated. / © AndroidPIT \nThe Z Play also offers Ambient Display technology and displays information such as the time and notifications with a simple interaction, such as taking it out of your pocket. This is not new technology and has been around for a while. Lenovo Moto Z Play special features \nWhat makes the Moto Z Play really special and unique are its modules. Here is an overview of some Moto Mods currently offered. Moto Mod: Insta Share Projector \nIt is impossible to look at the Moto Z Play projector module without thinking of the old Galaxy Beam. Back in 2012, this Samsung device came with a small embedded multimedia projector, and it was not a success. This Moto Mod operates the same way: it allows whatever is on the screen to be projected onto a flat surface with a resolution of WVGA 854 x 480 pixels (408 ppi). The projector module for the Moto Z line. / © AndroidPIT \nWhen connected to the device you can adjust the image to any surface, as well as the brightness of the screen and notification settings, which can be silenced during mirroring. This feature is especially important for those who might work conventions and, of course, for those lovers of holiday slideshows with a modern twist. \nThe projector comes with a 1,100-mAh battery for extra power. The Moto Z Play and the Insta Share Projector are almost impossible to hold when connected. However, it can be used without interruption, and the accessory has a built-in fan for cooling, just like in a PC. Rest the device on a flat service while projecting a video. / © AndroidPIT Moto Mod: JBL SoundBoost \nJBL Moto Mod increases the volume of your device by adding speakers, which provide stereo sound instead of mono. When the module connects to the smartphone, it vibrates and you can hear an audible alert. The JBL SoundBoost optimizes the Moto Z Play's sound quality. / © AndroidPIT \nIn addition to this, the JBL SoundBoost has audio of 80 dB SPL @ 0.5 m, frequency response from 200 Hz to 20 kHz and can run for about 10 hours. Moto Mod: Hasselblad True Zoom \nHasselblad is one of the most famous companies specializing in photographic equipment. It took images of the first man on the moon as well as the cover of the Beatles album Abbey Road. A very compact camera. / © AndroidPIT \nThe module has a Xenon flash, 10x optical zoom, RAW format support, a physical shutter and automatic backup. In other words, this module is better than many dedicated cameras out there. \nThe suggested price of this little beauty is $300. Lenovo Moto Z Play software \nThe Moto Z Play was initially launched with stock Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow however Verizon has confirmed it is finally rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to the Moto Z Play . This upgrade includes some new features like multitasking options, bundled notifications, quick settings and tiles, and most significantly: Doze Mode. The Moto Z Play already has a great battery life, so the Doze Mode feature should enhance battery life even more - this combination should make it an appealing device for those of you looking for a phone with great battery life. \nThere's no trace of bloatware, which is good and the experience is fluid and enjoyable. Those who are don't care for manufacturer-developed interfaces will be delighted with the Moto Z Play. \nThe ultimate Android UI comparison Enjoy the total Android experience with the Moto Z. / © AndroidPIT \nOne downside of the Moto Z Play is the lack of Android Nougat, the latest version of Android. True, the update will come quickly (Q4 of 2016) but it's always a mess to launch a smartphone with the old version of the OS. The fault is not exclusively with Lenovo, Google has to share of responsibility as well. Android Nougat update for smartphones and tablets Lenovo Moto Z Play performance \nThe Moto Z Play packs a Snapdragon 625 processor (octa-core), clocked at 2 GHz. This is backed by the Adreno 506 GPU and has 3 GB RAM. Its storage capacity is 32 GB, with microSD support offering the option to expand upon this. The Moto Z Play runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow / © AndroidPIT \nUnder normal use, the Z Play is quite satisfactory and it is difficult to note the performance differences with the rest of the Moto Z line. It does everything well, including multitasking. The optimization between software and hardware seems to be good. The pure version of Android certainly helped there. The only time you can see differences with most high-end smartphones is with fairly intensive games. \nHere's how the Moto Z Play and Moto Z performed in benchmark tests: 3D Mark Slingshot OpenGL 3.0 3D Slingshot OpenGL 3.1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T15:58:14.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
