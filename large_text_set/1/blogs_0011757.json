It is unknown whether Marshall Lee has feelings for Fionna, although in \" Bad Little Boy \" he says \"Why don't you just admit it? You're in love with me.\" Fionna also states that he flirts with her constantly. He also called her 'baby' in \" Good Little Girl \"'s song lyrics. Marshall Lee is first seen briefly in the episode \"Fionna and Cake,\" when he notices Fionna entering Prince Gumball's party and flashes her the sign of the horns, sticking his tongue out. (It is noted that this is one of the few times in the show where a character is shown with five fingers.) \nSimilar to Finn and Marceline's relationship, Marshall likes to mess with Fionna's head. In the second episode featuring Ice King's fan-fictions, \"Bad Little Boy\", he zooms into her house and steals the pastries Prince Gumball had brought for Fionna, leading her outside to investigate a noise that is probably him landing on her roof. When Fionna finds him on the roof playing his guitar, he looks up and smoothly says, \"Oh. Hey, Fionna.\" Fionna responds by smiling and says his name in a happy, excited way. He asks her to go to Lumpy Space Prince's Party, but she is uncertain at first of whether she should go, presumably because she has Prince Gumball over for company and would have to ditch him to go. Marshall transforms to bat form and reaches out his hand for hers, saying he knows she will give in. She smiles reluctantly and takes his hand before being flown into the forest. There at the party, he is seen doing obnoxious things and teasing her, all the while trying to convince her that he is evil. He even goes as far to fake a fatal injury and tell her to admit her love for him. While doing this, Fionna yells out and tells him that in his last moments he should be serious. She mentions that he likes to flirt with her and seems to think it is funny. When he sees her emotional and crying and reveals that he was only faking, Fionna angrily punches him, then chases him while he protests and proceeds to hit him again off-screen, laughing maniacally. Cake Edit \nMarshall often messes with Cake, but they seem to be on good terms. Although he pushed her into the bushes in the episode \"Bad Little Boy\" carelessly, calling her \"kitty\" rather condescendingly, she seemed to recover mostly and was seen smiling after Fionna picked her up and spoke in Cake's defense. She tried to break away from Marshall Lee when he kidnapped her and flew to the cemetery, which resulted in a short struggle and caused Marshall Lee to seemingly be pierced through the chest on a spear. When Marshall Lee appeared to be hurt, Cake used her body to shield him from the sun while it rose behind them. She was also visibly relieved when he revealed that he wasn't really dying, even though he had kidnapped her moments before. This completely contrasts with the way Jake the Dog persistently attempted to kill Marceline, despite his being terribly afraid of her, in the episode \"Henchman.\" Prince Gumball Edit \nMarshall Lee's relationship with Prince Gumball seems to be similar to Marceline and Princess Bubblegum 's rivalry toward one another. When Fionna and Gumball find Marshall Lee on the roof in \"Bad Little Boy\", they find Marshall was the one who had stolen Gumball's cream puffs. Marshall proceeds to drink the pink color out of a cream puff, then toss it at Gumball's head. When the puff hits him, Gumball's response is to grimace and begin climbing down from the roof, telling Fionna he is going inside and she can come with him if she would like \"more polite company.\" It is unknown what happened to him after Fionna and Marshall Lee ditched him to go to a party. It is presumable that they have a strong dislike for one another similar to that of Marceline and Princess Bubblegum. Though in the graphic novel, they seem to be fine with each other when creating the magical wand stick for Fionna. It also shows in the novel that when Marshall Lee takes his leave, he tells Fionna, \"Tell Gumball I said bye,\" showing that he cares in a way. Due to the relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum improving since season 7, Prince Gumball and Marshall's relationship concurrently improves, as well. However, the episode \" Five Short Tables \" revealed that Marshall Lee is a regret of Prince Gumball, so their relationship is left ambiguous from the standpoint of the show.
