Could   \nA quick-thinking schoolgirl took this photo as a ­paedophile tried to snatch her – and got him locked up. \nThe 14-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, snapped Roger Seath on her phone as he cornered her in Southsea, Hampshire. \nIt caused her 45-year-old attacker to freeze and a group of people driving past were alerted to what was going on. \nWhen police arrived Seath, who had threatened to ‘spank’ the girl if she did not go with him admitted his offence. \nJudge Anne Arnold praised the teenager’s actions at Portsmouth Crown Court, where Seath was sentenced on Friday. \nShe said: \"This was a particularly vulnerable victim in my view, a 14-year-old schoolgirl. \n\"She was certainly threatened by you with being spanked if she didn’t go with you. \n“Because she, very fortunately was an intelligent and alert girl with sufficient wherewithal to do exactly what she’d been told to do if approached by somebody such as yourself and that was why she took your photograph, freezing your approach long enough to be assisted.” Read More Paedophiles like appalling Mark Frost must NEVER be given access to children Roger Seath was sentenced to 33 months in jail at Portsmouth Crown Court (Photo: Getty) \nThe girl had been told by her mother to take a photo of anyone who approached her or hit out if she was touched following a previous report of another schoolgirl being approached. \nA motorist who was driving past when homeless Seath tried to grab the girl, confronted him as the terrified and tearful teenager was led away. \nRobert Bryan, prosecuting, said the defendant had followed the girl, matching her pace as she walked across the road to get away from him. \nThe court heard how after arriving in Portsmouth he was staying in a hotel, following schoolgirls and videoing them on his iPhone. \nFootage played in court showed him walking just two feet away from two other teenage girls and police found he had more than 300 images of girls from a social media network.
