Twitter By Kevin Winter, Raymond Hall/GC Images, Kevin Mazur/WireImage, all from Getty Images. Selena Gomez dates a very specific type it would seem: movie theater-renting Canadian songbirds. Way back in 2011, Justin Bieber rented out a theater complex in Winnipeg so he and Gomez could see Real Steel , a Hugh Jackman picture. Now, in the year of our lord 2017, The Weeknd did the same thing for her, but in Toronto, and the movie was Jordan Peele’s Get Out . The Weeknd and Bieber share a few things in the middle of their date-night Venn diagram. Let's go through the checklist: Have they both taken Gomez out? Check. Did they both rent a movie theater for a date night? Check. Is it a theater in Canada? Check. Are they Canadian? Check. Are they Canadians who can also, by many accounts, sing? Check. Etalk Canada , which originally reported the date, also noted a truly insane amount of food and drink for two human people: “two gin and tonics, two regular popcorns, a Twix, Maltesers, Twizzlers, two packs of Sour Patch Kids, and three regular-sized Diet Cokes.” A real sampler platter of movie-theater foodstuff. Bieber made his thoughts known about The Weeknd, as news of Gomez’s reported new love interest was breaking in the public. Those thoughts aren't great . Maybe this is a subtle troll on The Weeknd‘s part, a manner of tacitly responding to Bieber‘s slights. To really get under Bieber‘s skin, though, he might consider renting out the Staples Center in Los Angeles , or the Canadian equivalent. Maybe Gomez is just a film buff who enjoys a good flick in the privacy of an empty theater. She is, after all, the common denominator here.
