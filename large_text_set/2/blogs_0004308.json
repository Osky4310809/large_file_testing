Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu,, now heading a shrinking army, has sworn to keep the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) banner flying in the region despite his Senate post being threatened and he himself assailed on all fronts by avaricious APC stalwarts and opportunistic Southeast politicians casting wary and envious glances in his direction. When Mr Okorocha gleefully announced two Saturdays ago that three governors would be defecting to the APC, thereby courting heated controversies, he was fixated on the big prize of the presidency. Whether that big prize can now be secured in the face of the uproar the defections and controversies have generated is hard to say. But the ebullient Mr Okorocha, regardless of the abuse he has suffered in the hands of the pugnacious Anambra governor, Willie Obiano, is not an ordinary politician. His oratory, though it often lacks substance and backbone, is hugely striking. Given the chance and the pedestal, he can talk nineteen to the dozen. In fact the more important the occasion, the higher Mr Okorocha’s oratory soars. And as everyone knows, when oratory is in full flight, no one, least of all the ordinary voter, questions its relevance or lack of profundity. Oratory is but a stone’s throw from demagoguery; and demagoguery, historians have aptly noted, brought the mighty and enlightened Germany to heel in the 1930s, and can hold any people enthralled not only for moments but for longer duration than is god for their health. No one of course says Mr Okorocha is a demagogue, for that would be belittling his fine accomplishments over the years, his unquenchable philanthropic zeal, his bold political permutations, and his general prescience. But he loves to hear himself speak. So, when he took the microphone during the Southeast political stakeholders’ meeting recently, he easily forgot, in his exuberance, the prudence of weighing his statements well before inflicting them on his animated audience. If it was true that three governors were in talks with him to defect to the APC, except he had mastered the Nixonian amenity of secretly taping his guests and subverting their privacies, there was no way his word would weigh higher than his guests’ in the court of public opinion. Yet, it was difficult to imagine the Imo governor telling a lie against the hypothetical three, nor that having misread the enthusiasm of his guests, he exaggerated the import of their discussions and intentions. With the coming into the APC of virtually every Igbo politician of consequence, including the dour and ageing politician, Emmanuel Inwuanyanwu, and others like the publisher Orji Uzor Kalu, Jim Nwobodo, Ifeanyi Araraume, Emeka Offor, Tony Eze, George Moughalu, and Ken Nnamani to whom Mr Okorocha flippantly ceded leadership, it is not certain that any stouthearted politician remains outside the fold. After all, the enigmatic and level-headed Ogbonnaya Onu has been with the APC from the beginning, though not well appreciated or rewarded in a way that is commensurate with his effort to legitimise the party in the Southeast when it mattered. So, too, is the charismatic Chris Ngige, a sturdy politician and medical practitioner trapped in the unyielding and unexciting ministerial portfolio of Labour. And despite renouncing the APC with so much pageantry, nothing says that Senator Ekweremadu, nor any of the so-called hypothetical three, will not defect to the ruling party on a fortuitous tomorrow should the stock of President Muhammadu Buhari defy gravity and begin a relentless rise to the stratosphere. To be sure, there are still enough men of clout in the other parties in the Southeast to give the APC a run for their money in 2019; but at the furious rate of defection at the moment, it is hard to see many resolute politicians remaining inured to the ruling party’s talisman. The Movement for the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) and the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) may rail all they can, but the casual and carefree inducement thrown to the Southeast by ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo is probably the most enticing bait the region has happened upon in a long time. Coupled with the Okorocha razzmatazz aforesaid, the noisy and almost tumultuous defections to the APC engineered by incredible circumstances in recent months, and the general lack of enthusiasm for opposition politics in the region, an avalanche may soon occur. But first the uproar. Chief Obasanjo’s bait to the Southeast cannot be dismissed out of hand. Once nature gifted him the leadership of Nigeria in 1976, he brusquely shoved nature aside and took over the fortunes that came his way since then, and it seems also, the fortunes that came the way of most of his successors. He is himself neither a principled politician nor even a brilliant leader. He is in fact the perfect example of an average leader, a classic underachiever whose only redeeming feature is his inordinate love for hard work unrestrained by his well-known health challenges. Yet, this same proud and unfeeling and visionless leader has managed by dint of good fortune and unfathomable circumstances to crown himself the most successful kingmaker of this era. He badmouthed Ibrahim Babangida out of power, enthroned Umaru Yar’Adua as well as subverted him in the same ceaseless and reckless breath, emplaced Goodluck Jonathan and also ruined him with emphasis and completeness, and contributed immensely to returning the ossified and permanently disenchanted President Buhari to office. If the same man could therefore mention, no matter how glibly, that the Southeast should take a shot at the presidency in 2019, the region is likely to pay more than a cursory attention to his sweet nothings. There has been much talk of whether Chief Obasanjo meant 2019 or 2023 when he admonsihed the Igbo to take a shot. Hear him, as quoted by a newspaper, and draw your own conclusions: “But, irrespective of the thinking of the people ahead of 2019, I personally think that the Southeast should have a go at the Presidency, too.” There is no other way to interpret that statement. He meant 2019, but probably without much or any reflection. The group inspired by Mr Okorocha would prefer to take the shot in 2023, having servilely endorsed President Buhari for re-election in 2019, of course irrespective of whether the president possesses the stamina to continue or whether his policies ameliorate the stifling conditions of the people. Like the Southwest, the Southeast may never be clear who should speak for them: the governors and powerful political groups or the socio-cultural and partly political organisation, the Ohaneze Ndigbo. But it does seem overall that the regnant wisdom in the Southeast is for the region to support President Buhari in 2019 and to take a shot at the presidency in 2023, perhaps with a coronation in view. In short, the Southeast is gambling on the APC retaining its relevance and dominance in the foreseeable future, when in fact there are no objective conditions to suggest the bumbling party can manage to do so. Worse, by their sheepish and slavish mentality towards President Buhari, as exampled by their endorsement of his re-election when he has himself not said a word about his future electoral ambition, the group purporting to speak for the Southeast is taking a much huger and probably humiliating gamble. Who tells them that even if the contentious and fratricidal APC manages to keep its chin up till 2023, and by some celestial intervention President Buhari also holds out against his political and health challenges, that both the party and its truculent president would endorse a Southeast candidate? Do his present appointments, as skewed as they obviously are, indicate that admirable, equitable bent? Or is it simply because Chief Obasanjo suggested it could be their turn? The Southwest may be fractious and regicidal, as stereotype suggests, but given the behaviour of Southeast politicians and the bewildering choices they often make, not to say their loathing for opposition politics and the tough discipline and overbearing regimen it imposes, the Igbo obviously need far more tutoring and ear pinching to get their priorities right than the other regions in the South. Those in the Southeast who endorse President Buhari for re-election in 2019, and who shun the value of staying strong and building a powerful, principled and ideological national party, give no consideration to ethics or historical examples. The region has obviously not learnt from others that where the president comes from is not as important as his capacity to rule, nor as his judgement and his sense of fairness and justice. The Igbo must change course and deepen their politics. Apart from producing and nurturing a great politician with a pan-Nigerian outlook, the Igbo candidate must possess the sophistication these times call for, the ideology that can be sold by the aspirant and bought by the electorate, the charisma that will endear him to his immediate people and the rest of the country, and an admirable sense of justice that will shame that of President Buhari. In addition, the candidate must understand the geopolitical dynamics of Nigeria and get his permutations right. Nothing will come automatically. And unlike 2015 when there was a desperation to force out the more enlightened Dr Jonathan in place of the inscrutable candidate Buhari, that mistake will not be repeated, not in 2019, and not in 2023. The next president will be a democrat, and he will earn every vote that comes his way. The nonsense about ethnicity will be de-emphasised. So, too, will religion. Nigerians have seen where both superficialities have got them. And let the Southeast ponder what dilemma would confront them should the PDP, by a stroke of good fortune, start to rise in influence, ethics and appeal in the months ahead, as implausible as that might sound at the moment. For after all, there is a limit to how far rhapsodising the ruling party or the president can get a people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:15:40.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
