By: IANS | New Delhi | Published: March 11, 2017 12:21 PM “But for a new party (in the state) even coming at the second place is also a big thing,” Ashutosh added. “Don’t underestimate this.” \nThe AAP said on Saturday it was disappointed it did not win the Punjab assembly election but added that even becoming the main opposition was an achievement. “We were hoping to form a government in Punjab,” Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh told IANS. “We are disappointed with the result,” he said, as vote count showed the Congress sweeping to victory in assembly election. \n“But for a new party (in the state) even coming at the second place is also a big thing,” Ashutosh added. “Don’t underestimate this.” \nHe said all the AAP leaders needed to introspect where the party’s assessment of taking power in the border state with more than 100 of the 117 seats went wrong.The Congress is leading in the by-election to the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat in the counting of votes on Saturday, poll official said. \nAlso watch: \nCongress candidate Gurjeet Singh Aujla, a youth leader, was ahead of his BJP rival Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina by over 43,000 votes, the poll official added here. \nThe by-election was necessitated after the parliamentary seat was vacated in November 2016 by Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh following the Supreme Court verdict on the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal issue. \nAmarinder Singh had won the seat in the 2014 general elections in a high-profile contest against the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Arun Jaitley by over one lakh votes. \nThe Congress was surging ahead in the assembly elections in Punjab, leading in 65 out of 117 assembly seats.
