AP\nPresident-elect Donald Trump continued to dispute US intelligence reports that Russia strategically hacked and leaked internal emails from top Democratic sources, citing recent statements from embattled WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\nOn Wednesday, the president-elect blasted out a series of tweets quoting Assange's Tuesday interview with Fox News host and major supporter Sean Hannity in which the WikiLeaks founder parroted much of Trump's rhetoric criticizing media outlets.\n\"Julian Assange said 'a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta' — why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!\" Trump tweeted.\n\" @FoxNews : Julian Assange on U.S. media coverage: “It’s very dishonest.” #Hannity pic.twitter.com/ADcPRQifH9 \" More dishonest than anyone knows\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 The president-elect then blamed the Democratic National Committee for not taking more steps to block hackers, and claimed that DNC had not addressed the content of some leaked emails, though several top figures at the organization resigned after emails emerged showing several offering criticism of Sen. Bernie Sanders.\nSince reports emerged that intelligence agencies found substantial evidence that Russia meddled in the US election, Trump has steadfastly continued to cast doubt over the credibility of US intelligence officials on the subject.\nThe comments came just hours after Trump mocked US intelligence agencies for postponing a private intelligence briefing scheduled for Friday on the subject of the Russian hacks.\nThe \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 For his part, President Barack Obama continues to ramp up pressure on Russia in the waning days of his administration.\nLast week, Obama issued new sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies, and booted a number of diplomats and their families from the US.\nSEE ALSO: 'You may be seeing a bit more of me': Jesse Watters discusses past controversies and his future at Fox News NOW WATCH: Here are some incredible things you didn’t know about Putin's life Loading video...
