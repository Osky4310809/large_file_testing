He Called Donald Trump an ‘Authoritarian’ During Trump’s RNC Speech Authoritarians like @realDonaldTrump use promises of law & order to justify infringing on civil rights as they consolidate control by force. \n— Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) July 22, 2016 \nMcMullin has not been shy about his distaste for Trump’s policies. While Trump was delivering his speech at the Republican National Convention on July 21, McMullin called him an “authoritarian.” \n“Authoritarians like @realDonaldTrump use promises of law & order to justify infringing on civil rights as they consolidate control by force,” McMullin wrote. \nIn May, McMullin called on Trump to release his tax returns. Americans deserve to see @realDonaldTrump 's tax returns immediately. If he won't be transparent on this, how could we trust his presidency? \n— Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) May 11, 2016 \nEarlier that same month, he called on more Republicans to oppose Trump, using the hashtag #NeverTrump. Opposing @realDonaldTrump is about putting principle over power, a virtue some in Washington are too quick to abandon. #NeverTrump \n— Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) May 7, 2016 \nMcMullin’s Trump attacks haven’t been limited to Twitter. He also criticized Trump for attacking Muslims in a Facebook post. He wrote : \nAs Donald Trump continues attacking Muslims and as a former CIA officer, I’d like all Americans to know the truth: American and other Muslims have played a central role in virtually every counterterrorism win we’ve had since 9/11. They are an indispensable asset in this fight. Attacking them as a group makes America weaker, not stronger. \nMcMullin recently climbed significantly in a poll in his home state of Utah. The poll showed Trump tied with Clinton at 26 percent, with McMcullin receiving 22 percent support. \nMcMullin’s surge in Utah polls has gained so much notice that a white nationalist named William Johnson is doing robocalls in support of Donald Trump, The Daily Beast reported . In the calls, Johnson claims that McMullin’s parents are lesbians, that is a closet homosexual and supports gay marriage. These claims are all untrue, although McMullin said he respects the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision to legalize gay marriage. \nMcMullin issued a series of tweets in response to the robocalls. Another desperate attack from GOP nominee @realDonaldTrump and his racist supporters as he continues to lose ground in Utah. https://t.co/U8unh0OS3D \n— Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) October 31, 2016 This attack is consistent with @realDonaldTrump 's bigoted, deceitful campaign and vision for America. Utahns won't be fooled. \n— Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) October 31, 2016 . @Reince @GOP , this is your nominee and your supporter. They're defining you with white nationalism. Will you continue to embrace them? \n— Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) October 31, 2016 Will Utah GOP leaders continue to stand with @realDonaldTrump and white nationalists' as they attack my faith and spread baseless lies? \n— Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) October 31, 2016 I've stood for liberty and equality in this race; it's natural for @realDonaldTrump 's white supremacists to attack me.
