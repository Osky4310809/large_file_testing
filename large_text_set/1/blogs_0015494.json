FABRIZIO BENSCH/REUTERS \nPrime Minister Bill English and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are both keen on a speedy free-trade deal between New Zealand and the European Union. \nResponding to the suggestion New Zealand would have to be willing to take more refugees, in exchange for the deal, Merkel said there were no such plans to link the two. \nREAD MORE: * You need to front up, Bill \nMeanwhile, English said US President-elect Donald Trump's promise to pull out of the TPP wouldn't kill talks over the deal, and the government was still interested in pursuing a trade agreement with other negotiating countries: Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru. FABRIZIO BENSCH/REUTERS \nAngela Merkel also took questions about Donald Trump. \n\"If there is a change in the American policy and they decide not to sign up to it, then we'd look for other ways of continuing that engagement,\" English said. \nTrump said he plans to ditch the deal because he believes free-trade deals are damaging to US jobs. \nHowever, he's indicated his enthusiasm for a new deal with the United Kingdom. \nLast week, English met with British Prime Minister Theresa May to continue early talks over a new trade deal for New Zealand and the UK. Ad Feedback \nThe deal can't be signed until after the Brexit is complete, but both countries are keen to begin negotiations. \n\"We would negotiate an agreement with Britain when it's not in the EU and it's ready to negotiate,\" English said at his press conference with Merkel. \n\"We wouldn't see a role to get ahead of that process.\" \nMay was due to give a speech on Tuesday, giving further details of her Brexit plan. \nShe was expected to harden Britain's stance towards the EU, with speculation about the speech causing a sharp drop in the British pound. \nMerkel said Germany would be paying close attention to the speech, but reiterated that future negotiations between the EU and UK would would hinge on the content of the Article 50 application the UK files to trigger its exit from the 28-nation bloc. \n\"What will really count is what (application) is turned in to Europe,\" Merkel said. \n\"We will deal with the decision that Britain makes for itself ... We'll wait and see, and we'll take a look at it and will react to that.\" \nMerkel also faced questions about Trump, who tore into her immigration policies, calling them \"catastrophic\", in a joint interview with Germany's Bild and the Times of London . \n\"I have great respect for her, I felt she was a great leader, I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all these illegals and taking all these people where ever they come from and nobody really knows where they come from.\" \nMerkel, who is seeking a fourth term as chancellor, has adopted a policy of Germany accepting nearly all asylum seekers who receive refugee status, including one million in 2015. \nAt her press conference with English, Merkel said she would not comment about Trump before his inauguration on Friday. \n\"We have known what his position is for some time, and my position is also known,\" she said. \n- Stuff and Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:49:12.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
