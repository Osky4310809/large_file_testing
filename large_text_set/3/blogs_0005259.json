In the span 12 months, his brother got married, his grandmother passed away, his dad celebrated his retirement and his mom turned 60. Each occasion required a trip from Gortha’s home in Toronto to his native India, which would have quickly depleted his savings just when he was hoping to put a down payment on a new condo. So in April Gortha, who already had a full-time job at a financial institution, turned to Uber.

Of that, Uber took $1,310, leaving $4,094. Now that he has bought a house, he said, he plans to use his side-hustle to rebuild his savings. The goal is to make $200 per week, which he should be able to do by driving just eight hours a week on Saturday nights, when demand for Uber cars is highest and prices often spike (something known as surge pricing). “I like it,” he said, “Uber helped me meet my needs.” But talking to Global News on a Friday, he also added he wouldn’t work that weekend, since he had plans with friends — he also likes the freedom of taking a day off without checking in with a supervisor. The ability to take on an extra gig to pay for vacations and treats without pillaging your savings is tempting. But how do you organize your finances and pay taxes when you’re moonlighting as an Uber driver, tutor or weekend dance teacher? READ MORE: Canadian tax deadline: 9 things you need to know Here are some things to consider: Is it really worth the (side-) hustle? The first step is to figure out whether you’re really making enough to justify sacrificing weekends, evenings and holidays, warn tax accountants. Gig-economy workers, which are mostly contractors, often have a hard time telling gross from net pay. There are no payroll taxes and T4 income slips or, often, an easy way to calculate HST charges. And although some side hustles, like dog walker and babysitter, have been around for a long time, some of the high-tech odd jobs present unexpected challenges. One Calgary-based driver for a meal-delivery service, for example, told Global News, that while the company tells drivers they will be able to supplement pay with gratuities, many customers don’t know they’re supposed to tip. So how to make a cost-benefit calculation? First, understand how much of what you’re making will go to your contract employer, if you have one. You can also do some back-of-the-envelope math to see how much will go to taxes, based on your income tax bracket. Keep in mind, though, that your extra job could bump you into a higher bracket, which may, in and of itself, erase a good chunk of your financial gain.
