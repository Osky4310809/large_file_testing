The award ended up going to The Night Manager's Tom Hiddleston . \n\"It's the first time I've come to the show and have not done the red carpet,\" Theroux explained to ET . \"I just came to present, so I kind of did the dumb thing, where I just showed up to present, and you kind of get rushed into the back door.

There's a benefit to walking and sitting down, having some food, and then continuing on.\" PHOTOS: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's Matching Style \nAniston's ex-husband, Brad Pitt , also dropped by amid his divorce case with estranged wife Angelina Jolie .
