Alanis Morissette: from queen of alt rock to Guardian advice columnist Read more \nSchwartz admitted stealing nearly $5m from Morissette between May 2010 and January 2014. He used the money personally and falsely listed the cash withdrawals as “sundry/personal expenses” to cover up the crime. \nWhen confronted about the theft, Schwartz lied and said he invested the money in an illegal marijuana business, prosecutors said. \nSchwartz also admitted to stealing $2.3m from five other clients who were not named in court documents or disclosed by lawyers. \nNathan Hochman, defending, said Schwartz had cooperated with investigators and accepted responsibility. \nHis plea deal calls for a sentence between four and six years in a federal prison, though he could be sentenced to up to 23 years. \nSchwartz had offered financial guidance to some of the biggest stars while at GSO Business Management, which has worked with entertainers such as Katy Perry, 50 Cent and Tom Petty. \nSchwartz, who no longer works there, was said to represent Beyoncé and Mariah Carey, who both appeared at a fundraiser last year in support of a heart disease charity he founded. \nThe embezzlement was discovered after Morissette took her business elsewhere. Her new financial manager discovered millions of dollars missing and contacted GSO, according to lawsuits filed against Schwartz. \nGSO reviewed Schwartz’s work and discovered the other thefts, said GSO’s lawyer, Chris Reeder, who sued Schwartz after he was removed from the firm. \n“This was shocking and disappointing,” Reeder said. “The company is very happy he’s being brought to justice and held accountable for his actions.” \nReeder said GSO had since repaid the money he stole from clients. The firm’s pending lawsuit against Schwartz stated he used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle that included a $50,000 trip to Bora Bora and a $75,000 debt at a Bahamas casino. \nMorissette settled her lawsuit against Schwartz and the firm, according to a joint statement issued last year. Her publicist had no comment Wednesday. \nSchwartz is scheduled to appear in court on 1 February on the criminal charges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T10:02:44.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
