Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Neil Gorsuch Tammy Duckworth joins effort to block Neil Gorsuch confirmation vote \nIllinois senator criticized Gorsuch’s refusal to meet, as more than 30 Democrats plan now plan not to support Donald Trump’s supreme court nominee View more sharing options   02.05   02.10 BST \nIllinois Senator Tammy Duckworth announced Thursday that she would join fellow Democrats in blocking a confirmation vote on Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump’s supreme court nominee . \nDuckworth, a combat veteran of the Iraq War who was first elected to the Senate in 2016, cited in a statement the refusal of Gorsuch to meet with her as one key reason for her vote. \n“Judge Gorsuch has not made the effort to meet with me in person to answer the serious questions I have about his record and he in fact cancelled a meeting we had previously scheduled,” said Duckworth. She added: “I refuse to vote to end debate on a nominee who refuses to provide any answers to my questions.” Neil Gorsuch's confirmation hearing revealed his hidden similarity to Trump Read more \nOver 30 Democrats have now announced their decision not to support Gorsuch’s nomination. Forty-one votes are needed to keep Republicans from achieving the 60-vote super-majority required to end debate on a supreme court nomination. \nSo far, only two Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, have announced their support for Gorsuch. Both represent red states and face re-election in 2018. \nHowever, should Democrats block the nomination, there is the potential for Senate Republicans to attempt to end the filibuster via a so-called “nuclear option” which involves changing Senate rules so that only a simple majority is required. Senate Democrats took this step on all nominations, save for those to the supreme court, in 2013. \nGorsuch’s nomination comes after Senate Republicans refused to even schedule a hearing for Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee for the supreme court seat vacated by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. The refusal to hold hearings significantly heightened partisan tensions over the court.
