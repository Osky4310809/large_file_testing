They did not touch the driver. The killers disappeared back into the bush. \n“My family was informed that a farmer, who was on a hill not far away, saw everything. We have taken the corpses to the Zangon Kataf General Hospital.” \nCOE source speaks \nWhen contacted, one of the management staff of the institution said it was true that such violence took place, but that only four of the victims were students of the school. \nHe said: “I cannot talk to you officially. But I can attest that it was four of the victims that were students of COE, Gidan Waya.” \nNatives of the place claimed that since residents of the villages on that axis have all fled, after their homes were burnt, the road had become very insecure. \nCOE, Gidan Waya had been shut down last November when many of its surrounding communities came under siege from herdsmen. But, some students still stayed back, especially final year students.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T10:51:14.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
