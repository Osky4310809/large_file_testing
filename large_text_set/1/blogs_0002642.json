Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAntonio Conte has hit back at Jose Mourinho by claiming Chelsea 's title rivals are only whinging about their fixture schedule because they are top of the table. \nThe Premier League leaders will set a new top-flight record of 14 consecutive wins in one season — and open up an eight-point gap to second-placed Liverpool — if they beat Tottenham on Wednesday night. \nFormer Blues boss Mourinho, now at Manchester United, claimed Spurs and Chelsea had the “privilege” of playing on Wednesday — getting extra rest during the hectic holiday period. \nUnited, in contrast, played on New Year's Eve and then again just 48 hours later, on Monday evening. \nBut Conte claimed his side are now a target because they are hot title favourites.

This also happens in Italy. It’s always because you stay at the top of the table.” \nConte lavished praise on Spurs opposite number Mauricio Pochettino and claimed the Argentinean “can be one of the best coaches in the world”.

Also, this season, there is a very important player for him, who is Victor Wanyama [signed in the summer from Southampton]. He is a really good player.” \nChelsea equalled Arsenal’s 2001-02 mark of 13 wins in a season by beating Stoke at the weekend. And victory at White Hart Lane will see them open up a 13-point gap over Spurs – and surely end their title hopes again, after the Battle of the Bridge did the same thing in May. \nBut Conte, who won eight Serie A titles with Juve as a player and then their coach, insisted: “You don’t win and you don’t lose a championship in one game. You win a championship over a season.” Serial winner Conte was part of EIGHT Serie A titles with Juventus as player and coach (Photo: Getty) Read More \nThe Italian is so obsessed with winning he named his daughter Vittoria – the Italian word for victory. \nHe joked: “This name is nice. \n\"It’s an important name, above all in England!

Very English, because I knew one day I would arrive here in England to work! \n“I like this name and I wanted this name for my daughter.
