On Sunday, the Republican tweeted support for Islamophobic Dutch politician Geert Wilders, writing, “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” \n\nSo far, few Republicans have condemned King’s comments, which made former KKK Imperial Grand Wizard David Duke very, very happy:\n\n\nI’m not sure why, but CNN’s Chris Cuomo attempted to give King a chance to redeem himself by clarifying his comments on Monday morning. But King—who has in the past compared DREAMers to drug mules, opposed putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill because that would be, in his words, both “racist” and “sexist,” and proudly places the Confederate Flag on his desk —doubled down on his racist white supremacist garbage.\nAdvertisement \n\nAdvertisement \n\n“Of course I meant exactly what I said,” he said. \n“Who is somebody else’s babies?” Cuomo asked. King did not say, instead describing a vision of American civilization preserved by kids who play football and basketball or some shit.\nCuomo tried again, saying, it seems like “you were trying to say ‘someone else’s babies’ means ‘you’re either white or you’re not right.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T18:19:32.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
