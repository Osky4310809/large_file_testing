While you’re busy chowing down on carton after carton of kung pao and General Tso’s and Mongolian beef, the side of white rice often gets neglected before sitting in the fridge until it expires. \nWell, no more. \nHomer Murray and Sean Telo of Brooklyn restaurant 21 Greenpoint recently stopped by the MUNCHIES Test Kitchen to show us the very best way to revive your leftover rice: turn it into this bangin’ Portuguese sausage fried rice. Sure, you can also make rice from scratch, but why bother? RECIPE: Portuguese Sausage Fried Rice \nJust fry up some smoky linguica sausage, then pop your rice out of that paper carton and cook it in the sausage grease along with garlic, celery, and onion, before adding a couple of eggs and some scallions on top. \nIt’s salty, smoky, and nourishing as hell on a cold winter night. And best of all, if you’re using leftover rice, you only need one pan. General Tso’s got nothing on this dish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:12:34.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
