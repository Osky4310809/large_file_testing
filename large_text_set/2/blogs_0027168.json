The Kurt Cobain-inspired distressed knitwear works extremely well with those indulgent velvet track ensembles and the brand’s outerwear offering is particularly strong and surprisingly eclectic. There’s everything from embossed outerwear to metallic puffers to heavy-duty duffle coats and it’s all sublime.\nFor more fashion news, check out Danish label Apocs’ Yves Klein inspired SS17 lookbook. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:49:03.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
