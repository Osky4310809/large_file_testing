Per ESPN's Adam Schefter , in addition to Fox Sports showing interest, CBS is \"making a strong push\" to bring Romo to its NFL coverage team. Schefter previously reported Fox Sports was pursuing Romo as a replacement for John Lynch, who left the network to take over as general manager of the San Francisco 49ers , but Romo's goal is to continue his NFL career. Dak Prescott emerged as the Cowboys' starting quarterback last season after Romo suffered a fractured vertebra in his back during a preseason game.

Schefter and ESPN colleague Todd Archer reported on March 8 that Romo was going to be released by the team he's played his entire 13-year career with. The following day, however, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported (via NFL.com's Marc Sessler ) the Cowboys were going to try trading Romo in an effort to acquire something in exchange for the four-time Pro Bowler. In the two weeks since that report, Romo remains under contract to the Cowboys with no clear end in sight to the situation. The 36-year-old has been unable to stay on the field the past two seasons due to collarbone and back injuries. Romo led the Cowboys to a 12-4 record and posted a career-best 69.9 completion percentage in 2014, his last full season as the team's starter.
