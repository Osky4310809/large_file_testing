Van Zyl decided to use a Cleveland Smart Square Stubby putter that is normally used as a training aid. \nThe putter is a smaller version of the Smart Square Blade putters and is designed to train golfers to consistently hit the sweetspot. \nVan Zyl was 1 under par after 13 holes before play was suspended. \nContributions from writers and editors on the Golf Channel Digital team.
