ADVERTISEMENT \nThe tropical depression was expected to be 405 km east-northeast of Hinatuan on Sunday, and outside the Philippine area of responsibility, 1,150 kilometers east of Guiuan, Eastern Samar, by Thursday. \nNo storm signals had been raised, but Bising was packing maximum sustained winds of up to 45 kph near the center and gustiness of up to 55 kph. Rainfall was still expected to be moderate to occasionally heavy within the 300-kilometer diameter of the tropical cyclone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:34:53.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
