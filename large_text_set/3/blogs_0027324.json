Both CNN and Reuters speculated from Belgian and French sources that the man was intoxicated and in possession of illicit drugs and may have been trying to avoid a police checkpoint.   \nThat said, considering the previous day’s terror attack in London, not to mention the terror bombing in Brussels which had occurred just a year earlier, authorities remained on high alert. \nIf the investigation of the incident reveals that it was, in fact, Islamist-inspired, expect to see Belgian and French authorities making a slew of arrests over the next several days and weeks as the man’s associates are detained and questioned. \n“I want to thank the fast response team which arrested the man in a professional manner and may have prevented much worse,” Antwerp Mayor Bart De Wever said. \nThankfully, nobody was injured or killed in what could have been yet another tragedy in Europe.
