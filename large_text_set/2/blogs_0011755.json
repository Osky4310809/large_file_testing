Our mission is persuade them to do so.\" \nBritain's governing Conservative Party is advocating what is referred to as a \"Hard Brexit,\" which would see the country leave the bloc's single market and customs union. This will create barriers to trade, but supporters say that it is the only way the U.K. can take full control of its immigration policy. “ This is not the starting point for an active fightback, because Blair is such a divisive personality” \nBlair told the audience: \"The road we're going down is not simply Hard Brexit, it is Brexit at any cost.\" \nHe acknowledged that immigration had been a core issue for many voters in the referendum, saying that many were particularly concerned about \"immigration from non-European countries, especially when from different cultures in which assimilation and potential security threats can be an issue.\" \nRelated: Brexit Fallout: Prices Rise in U.K.Following Vote to Leave EU \nBlair led the U.K. from 1997 to 2007, winning three consecutive election victories for the Labour Party. His decision to involve Britain in the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, however, was hugely controversial, eventually forcing him from office and making him a hate figure for many voters. \nDespite Blair setting out stall as a standard-bearer against Brexit, experts tell NBC News that his speech is unlikely to mark the start of a broad-based movement against the move out of the EU. \n\"This is not the starting point for an active fightback, because Blair is such a divisive personality,\" said Professor Richard Whitman, head of the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Kent.
