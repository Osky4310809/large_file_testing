Through the fight, Gypsy used her portal-creating powers to take Cisco through various Earths, some of which we’ve seen a part of the Arrowverse before and one, well...we’re not quite sure what that one is. \nThe first alternate earth we saw and was confirmed by Cisco was Earth-2, otherwise the first alternate earth we were ever introduced too. In the second season, Zoom discovered how to cross over between the two earths and brought many of the Metahumans of Earth-2 along with him, including doppelgangers of Cisco (Rupture), Caitlin Snow (Killer Frost), and Laurel Lance (Black Siren). \nGypsy then took Cisco to Earth-38, the earth where Kara Zor-El fights crime in Supergirl as the titular character. Coincidentally enough, when Gypsy vibed the fighting duo to this earth, they crashed landed in the offices of CatCo Worldwide Media. As the fall down and break a table, we’re treated to a cameo of Miss Tessmacher, an assistant at CatCo whom we haven’t seen since the season two premiere of Supergirl. \nLast we were taken to an earth that we haven’t necessarily seen before. A planet that appears to be full of storms and lava, we haven’t seen the third earth in the Arrowverse before. It could be the show’s nod to a legendary place such as Apokolips, the home of Darkseid, or it could have been a location such as Kamandi in a post-Great Disaster or Crisis on Infinite Earths world. \nSee screengrabs from the episode in the gallery below. \nWhat’d you think of tonight’s episode of The Flash? Did you like the different worlds we were treated to as Gypsy and Cisco vibed through them all? What do you think the last earth was?
