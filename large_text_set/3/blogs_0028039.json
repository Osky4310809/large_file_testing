Large cream-colored columns have their original, century-old crown moulding and the original tile mosaic floor is underfoot. Benita Cooper Design did concept and layout, working with interior designer/fabricator Ian Chapin of Edsel Co. \nThe shop sells drip coffee and espresso beverages made with a Synesso Cyncra 2 Group machine, as well as a menu of hand-poured, single-origin coffee, brewed to order through a Chemex from their proprietary line of beans, which also are for sale. \nMenu - including breads from High Street on Market and foods from Lil Pop Shop, Weckerly’s Ice Cream, Sugar Philly and Nathan Miller Chocolate - is similar to that available at the Lombard Street shop. \nToasts and a Cubano sandwich round out the savory items. \nHours are 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays, 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends. \nA Rival Bros. shop on East Passyunk Avenue is in the works for later in 2017.
