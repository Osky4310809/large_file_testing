He’s anti-worker, anti-woman, and not a friend of the LGBT community. The latter is especially interesting since both Gorsuch isn’t easily “pigeonholed” on the issue, according to friends of the jurist, both gay and straight, Democratic and Republican. The New York Times reported in February, that when his former clerk married his husband in 2014, Gorsuch was “thrilled ,” hardly the reaction from an anti-gay spawn of Satan, which is how the Left views this man: Phil Berg was nervous as he prepared to tell Neil Gorsuch he was gay. \nAIDS was still in the headlines at the time, the early 1990s, and same-sex marriage was a far-fetched notion. Some of Mr. Berg’s other friends had not reacted well to his news. So he moved with caution, slipping the word “boyfriend” casually into conversation with Mr. Gorsuch, his dear friend and Harvard Law School classmate. \n“He didn’t skip a beat,” Mr. Berg, now a corporate lawyer in Manhattan said, recalling how that conversation led to a “special bond” between the two men. “It was a huge deal for me, and it made a lasting impression.” \n[…] \nJust this past week [NYT article was published on Feb. 11], the gay author and blogger Michaelangelo Signorile published a piece in The Huffington Post headlined: “Why Neil Gorsuch Likely Believes It’s Perfectly Fine to Ban Gay Sex.” In it, he argued that Judge Gorsuch “may be all mild-mannered and cuddly, but that doesn’t mean he wouldn’t in a heartbeat deny your very existence under the Constitution if you happen to be queer.” \nAgainst that backdrop, the judge’s gay friends — both Democrats and Republicans — find themselves vouching for him. \n“I said, “Listen, I’m a liberal gay Jew from New England and you were appointed by George W. Bush, and I want to make sure I’m not going to be uncomfortable here,’” said Joshua Goodbaum, a former clerk of Judge Gorsuch, recalling his 2008 job interview. \nAnd when Mr. Goodbaum married his longtime partner in 2014 — the year before the Supreme Court’s landmark decision on same-sex marriage — he said, “The judge was thrilled for us.” \n[…] \n“Since Ronald and I married,” Mr. Berg wrote on Facebook, referring to Ronald Riqueros, “we have had a standing invitation to stay with Neil and Louise in Denver. And just last week, Neil told me that if they should move to D.C., ‘Our guest room will be waiting.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:32:24.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
