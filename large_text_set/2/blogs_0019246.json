The online retailer topped the national Harris Corporate Reputation Poll in rank this week with a score of 86.27, which Amazon is rounding up for its coupon. The Harris poll measures large American corporations over a number of metrics, including \"social responsibility,\" \"emotional appeal,\" and \"workplace environment\"â€”and Jeff Bezos is probably stoked to score high in that last category, all things considered .\nAmazon's 2017 score is the top out of 100 American companies, beating tech companies such as Apple (82.07), Netflix (79.86), Hewlett-Packard (77.83), and more. The bottom-ten list includes a few companies that have seen their share of bad news on Ars Technica recently, including Comcast , Charter , and Volkswagen .\nBack to the coupon : as expected, it doesn't apply to every single item Amazon sells. That 17.2 percent off your first $50 won't work for digital content purchases, Amazon gift cards, video games, or purchases placed through any interface other than Amazon.com on a standard Web browser. (Sorry, Alexa.) And third-party marketplaces don't join the fun, either; \"Amazon.com\" has to be a product's seller. Still, a lot of third-party gift cards will accept the discount, including digital currency and subscription cards for video game services, and that alone may be a good driver for coupon hunters.\nShould Amazon shoppers not wish to fill their carts enough for a less-than-20-percent code, they have another relatively new option: a drop to $35 as a minimum order amount to qualify for free non-Prime shipping. Meaning, if you don't subscribe to Amazon's $99/year Prime service, you can now spend a little less, as of Tuesday , to get the company's \"standard\" (read: slower) shipping for free on orders. That amount is even lower ($25) if that amount is solely spent on books.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:12:24.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
