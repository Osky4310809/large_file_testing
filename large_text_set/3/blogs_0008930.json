Among the women who were taken away by police were the founders of the Women’s March including Linda Sarsour. From CNN :\nNYPD would not confirm who was detained, but the Women’s March said some of its organizers were “arrested.”\nHowever, NYPD said no charges have been filed and would not classify the detentions as arrests.\n“Some people have been detained,” NYPD said.\nThe Women’s March Twitter account posted video of a group of people marching into the street, though you can’t really tell from this angle how many people were involved:\n\"Whose streets? Our streets!\" pic.twitter.com/B9ecG083SV \n— Women's March (@womensmarch) March 8, 2017 \n\nWe are blocking traffic as a form of civil disobedience in Columbus Circle (outside Trump Hotel). #DayWithoutAWoman \n— Women's March (@womensmarch) March 8, 2017 \n\nNine minutes later:\nSome of us have been arrested #DayWithoutAWoman pic.twitter.com/WSYVdrQjxA \n— Women's March (@womensmarch) March 8, 2017 \n\nMany of our national organizers have been arrested in an act of civil disobedience. We will not be silent. #DayWithoutAWoman \n— Women's March (@womensmarch) March 8, 2017 \n\nTime published video of what look like arrests using plastic handcuffs:\n\nFinally, the Associated Press published a video showing more of the rally in New York up to the time of the arrests. There’s plenty of enthusiasm and some chanting about immigrants. The only other policy issue that gets a mention in this clip is the defunding of Planned Parenthood.\n\nSo how many people were involved in this strike in New York and nationwide? And what exactly did it accomplish? The New York Times reported “hundreds of people” in New York and their article on today’s strike seems to be offering excuses for low turnout :\nIt was always unlikely that a general strike, labeled “A Day Without a Woman,” would produce the same turnout as the post-inauguration marches. The strike lacked the marches’ momentum coming off the election, as well as their virality and visuals, like the photogenic pink “pussy hats” that many attendees wore. It is also hard to tally participation or impact because employers could not provide counts of how many women stayed home, and retail figures are not yet available to show whether women stopped spending money.\nSome questioned the decision to call a strike at all. “In order to work, a general strike has to actually stop something from functioning,” said Todd Gitlin, a former president of Students for a Democratic Society who has written about political movements. “Anywhere it hasn’t done that can’t be counted as a success. It plays to your inner audience, not your outer audience.”\nToday’s event seems to have followed the rule of movie sequels, i.e. they’re rarely as good and sometimes even muddle people’s feelings about the original.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T03:33:24.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
