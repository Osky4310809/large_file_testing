Advertisement \nThe feature, which is rolling out to users on Android and iOS over the coming weeks, will let you upload several photos into gallery post. When uploading photos, you can tap and hold an image to change the order of your posts, then add filters if you want. You’re restricted to square photos at the start with just one caption for all the photos. From another user’s point of view, they’ll see blue dots underneath a photo, which shows that they can then swipe to the right and left to go through the gallery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:38:08.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
