Hyundai reportedly plans to roll out its second generation of fuel cell SUVs in January 2018.\n\nA 348-mile range would put Hyundai ahead of the Toyota Mirai , which travels 312 miles per fill-up, but behind Honda's new Clarity Fuel Cell, which travels 366 miles, as MotorTrend points out. Hyundai is apparently looking to price the 2018 fuel cell SUVs at about $50,000 a pop.\n\nAdditionally, Hyundai is set to debut its fuel cell-powered commercial bus in 2017, putting it in direct competition with Toyota , which has plans to do the same, Nikkei says.Hyundai is also preparing to release its first all-electric vehicle, the Ioniq , in the United States next year. That model comes in fully electric, plug-in and gasoline-hybrid versions. Take a look at it in photos or, if you're in Los Angeles, take a free two-hour spin in a branded Ioniq via the WaiveCar ridesharing app.\n\nThis article by Jessica Conditt originally ran on Engadget , the definitive guide to this connected life .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T16:15:27.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
