Hanging out together? Having a good time? Eating, drinking, making merry? Looking out for each other? Sharing secrets? Taking trips together? Yes, all of these things, and more. But, friendship goes beyond just shared experiences and fun stories. Our friends influence who we are as people. You know how they say that you can judge someone by their friends? It's true, because friends affect our choices. Such as... Having strong-willed friends is good for your will power. According to a study published in Psychological Science , if you find it hard to stick by your decisions, it might help to surround yourself with friends who have strong will power and discipline. Leaning on to people who stick to their resolve, can motivate you to stick to your own. Your friends can influence how long a relationship lasts . This goes beyond them just liking, or not liking your partner. They can dislike your partner, but support your relationship, and like your partner as an individual, but not think that you two are a good fit. If they support the union, it is more likely to last. Having close friendships can benefit your health, later in life. In our 20s, we focus on having a large number on friends than close, intimate friendships. This changes as we enter our 30s. Our social circle shrinks, but becomes more fulfilling. According to a study published in Psychology and Ageing , this positively affects our health in our 50s. Yes, having even one or two close friends in your 30s will make you healthier in your 50s. Our friends influence our sex lives, too! Yes, according to a study , for those of us in the age group of 20 - 24 years, friends have the maximum influence on the decisions we make about our sex lives. We can discuss our sex lives with our friends freely, and most often, we learn from each other. Over time, this influence decreases, but it makes sense that it is so during our early twenties, because this is when we are laying the foundation for who we become sexually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:46:17.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
