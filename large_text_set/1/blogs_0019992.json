She then goes on to share the reason behind her hospital visit. \n“So, I started planning. Had a baby shower to go to. Had a chance to go to the store and see mad baby stuff. I bought a pregnancy journal. Never for one second thought that it would end like this. In the hospital,” Remy Ma said in her IG video. \nIn the caption to the clip, the New York City MC explained that she didn’t initially plan on making news of her miscarriage public. She added that it was the words of her husband and fellow rapper, Papoose , that provided her with a change of heart. \nThe couple did not provide details on when the miscarriage took place.

I was totally against it but in a fit of crying @papoosepapoose said ‘you are not the only one going thru this , we will get thru it’…made me realize how many women like myself experience the same thing and don’t have a strong partner by their side to say it will be alright.” \nPapoose also offered his thanks to fans, writing “I wanna thank everyone for the support tough time for us” in the caption to a photo of himself and Remy. \nThis would have been the couple’s first child together. Remy Ma has a teenage son, while Papoose has three children.
