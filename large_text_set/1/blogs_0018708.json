Arsene Wenger gets sent off following Arsenal's penalty and contact with the fourth offical. \nArsene Wenger has enjoyed an incredible 20-year reign at Arsenal, but he's been involved in a fair few bust-ups too. After the Gunners' manager was criticised for appearing to push fourth official Anthony Taylor during the 2-1 win over Burnley this weekend, we take a look at some of his previous form. \n2000 -- Paul Taylor \nWenger allegedly confronted fourth official Paul Taylor in the dressing room after a 1-0 defeat to Sunderland on Aug. 19 that saw Patrick Vieira sent off. The manager was handed a 12-match ban and fine of four weeks' wages after charges of physical intimidation and threatening behaviour were brought against him. However, on appeal, the charges were reduced to improper conduct and, instead of being banned, Wenger was fined £10,000 and had to pay the costs of the appeal board. \n2005 -- Mark Hughes \nWenger and Mark Hughes have never really seen eye-to-eye and they have had quite a history of handshake refusals: the first of which came after an FA Cup for Arsenal over Blackburn in 2005 when the Frenchman walked straight down the tunnel and Hughes sarcastically waved after him. Since then, at Hughes' other clubs, there have been plenty of arguments on the touchline and harsh words off it . \n2006 -- Martin Jol \nArsenal vs. Tottenham is heated enough as it is without the two managers going head-to-head . Here, Wenger was angry Spurs didn't put the ball out of play for an injury to Gilberto Silva before Robbie Keane's goal. Jol said he did not see the incident, Wenger accused him of \"lying\" and refused to shake his hand following the 1-1 draw after almost coming to blows. \n2006 -- Alan Pardew \nMarlon Harewood's late goal to clinch a 1-0 victory for West Ham in November sent manager Alan Pardew into raptures; Wenger was not impressed . The fourth official had to get between the two managers to prevent more than just a pushing match and, later, Pardew apologised for his part: \"I was celebrating the goal, that was all basically. Arsene seemed to have a problem with that, probably rightly. It was frustration, there was nothing personal.\" \n2007 -- Reinold Wiedemeijer \nIt took until 2007 for Wenger to earn his first touchline ban: for remonstrating with Dutch official Reinold Wiedemeijer over alleged time-wasting from Sevilla's Daniel Alves in a 3-1 defeat in the Champions League. He was sent off , spent the rest of the game watching from behind the advertising boards, rather than in the stands, and was given a one-match ban. Wenger takes his place among the Manchester United fans in the stands. \n2009 -- Bottle at Old Trafford \nHumans have not been the only victims of Wenger's anger on the touchline: a water bottle bore the brunt in a 2-1 defeat against Man United at Old Trafford. Wenger kicked out at the bottle after referee Mike Dean had ruled out a late equaliser from Robin van Persie because William Gallas was offside. Dean sent Wenger off, insisting he went into the stands, resulting in the memorable pictures of Wenger standing among the United fans, arms outstretched. \n2011 -- Kenny Dalglish \nIt had been a while since Wenger went head-to-head with another manager on the touchline and he chose Liverpool's Dalglish as his next target . In a 1-1 draw that had 12 minutes of added time, Arsenal thought they had won after a 98th-minute penalty from Robin van Persie, but then conceded four minutes later as Emmanuel Eboue fouled Lucas Leiva. Wenger was furious and Dalglish was there to argue with him, evidently telling him to \"p--- off.\" \n2011 -- UEFA add to ban \nWenger and Samir Nasri were both given a one-match Champions League ban after comments made to referee Massimo Busacca after Van Persie was sent off in the 3-1 defeat to Barcelona in March. But it got worse for Wenger: the game he was meant to be banned for, a 1-0 win over Udinese the following season, saw him found guilty of contacting his staff. UEFA then added two more games to his ban and fined him €10,000 for improper conduct. Wenger and Mourinho got physical back in 2014. \n2014 -- Jose Mourinho \nThe list would not be complete without Jose Mourinho. In fact, a full list of his bust-ups with the Portuguese can be found here . But this one took the biscuit. Wenger took exception to a tackle from Gary Cahill on Alexis Sanchez; Mourinho stood in the way and a shoving match ensued. \nAsked if he regretted the managers' feud turning physical, Wenger said afterwards: \"No. What is to regret after that? I wanted to go from A to B and somebody confronted me in between without any sign of welcome. B was Sanchez, to see how badly he was injured.'' \nNow there's a whole new chapter being written with Manchester United . It's back on! (Just not with Chelsea this time). Wenger vs. Mourinho. pic.twitter.com/j7pwmld9AO - ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) May 27, 2016 \n2016 -- Stoke \nWenger pushing a match official? That's already happened this season , against Stoke in December, but the Arsenal boss avoided any subsequent action. It was a gentle push on Paul Tierney, but the old rule of \"you should never put your hands on an official\" should really have stood. \nOngoing -- His coat \nIf there's one implement of Wenger's downfall on the touchline, it has been his running battle with his coat zipper. Seemingly unable to get it to work as it should , Wenger has enjoyed a love-hate relationship with his jacket for years. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T14:40:39.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
