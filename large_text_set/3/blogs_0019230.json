Veterans Group Calls On Melania Trump To Condemn Marine Corps Nude Photo Scandal \nThe failed launch comes one day after North Korea threatened retaliation over U.S. and South Korean military drills while touting the capabilities of its nuclear force as a “treasured sword of justice and the most reliable war deterrence.” \n“South Korea and the US are aware of the missile launch and to their knowledge North Korea’s missile was not successfully launched,” added South Korea’s Ministry of Defense in a statement. \nDetails on the type of missile that North Korea fired, or why it failed, has yet to be released. The U.S. Pacific Command said it was working with interagency partners for a more detailed assessment of the missile failure.   \nThe latest tests have the entire region on edge. \nChina’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on Wednesday called on all nations with interest in the Korean Peninsula to “exercise restraint.” \n“The current situation on the peninsula is extremely tense —‘everyone with his dagger drawn’ would be a fair description,” Chunying said. \nThis marks the second missile launch by North Korea. Kim Jung-Un’s regime launched four ballistic missiles on March 6, three of them landing less than 200 miles off the coast of Japan.

That’s a third of the time they used to need,” Carl Schuster told CNN after the missile tests in early March. \nAlso this week, North Korea boasted it had cleared the way for “a new birth” of its rocket industry following the test of a long-range missile engine at the Tonchang-ri rocket launch station . \nPresident Donald Trump blasted Kim Jong-Un for “behaving very badly” in a tweet following the recent provocations by the Hermit Kingdom. North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been \"playing\" the United States for years. China has done little to help! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2017 \nThe president believes the “ greatest immediate threat ” to the U.S. is North Korea and its growing nuclear capabilities, according to senior administration officials.
