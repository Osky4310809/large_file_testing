Greater Manchester experienced a 197 percent increase. \nDespite the noticeable increase in reported cases of abuse, there are still up to 13,000 victims of human trafficking in the UK, according to the government. \nModern-day slaves are forced into various activities, from prostitution to unpaid work in factories and nail bars. They are often vulnerable individuals who are dependent on their captor in some way, and a disproportionate number are foreign citizens residing in the UK illegally, usually trafficked by their abusers. \nThe NCA report states that there were victims from 102 different countries, though Albanian, Vietnamese, and Nigerian nationals are the most common. People from Sudan make up the fastest growing category of modern slavery victims. \nThe main obstacle in dealing with human trafficking is the apparent “ hidden nature ” of the crime. \nIn response, the Local Government Association (LGA), a group that represents 370 local councils, urged the British public to be more aware of human trafficking in order to prevent criminal gangs from exploiting vulnerable foreign workers. \n“ Modern day slavery is a rising threat to our communities, and because of its hidden nature, is a major concern, ” Simon Blackburn, the head of the LGA’s Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said.

A simple phone call could make a world of difference to people living wretched lives at the hands of heartless gangmasters, ” Blackburn added. \nHome Secretary Amber Rudd recently announced the creation of an £11mn ($13.7 million) fund that aims to deal with the proliferation of human trafficking. \nSimilarly, British Prime Minister Theresa May called modern slavery “ the greatest human rights issue of our time. ” \nOne of the most recent cases of modern slavery was uncovered last month, when 16 women were released from a trafficking ring operating in Glasgow. \nThe victims were smuggled from Slovakia and forced into slave labor, including prostitution and domestic servitude.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T18:57:05.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
