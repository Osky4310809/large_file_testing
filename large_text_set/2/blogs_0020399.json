But it looks like officers may now be randomly inspecting passengers traveling on domestic flights as well. \nLast night, following a seemingly uneventful journey from San Francisco to New York-JFK, passengers on Delta flight 1583 were greeted by an unusual sight as they exited the aircraft: two US CBP officers verifying “documents” of exiting passengers. While an ID is typically required for air travel within the US , it’s certainly unusual — and perhaps a bit concerning — for Customs and Border Protection officers to check identification upon arrival of a domestic flight. \nPassengers took to Twitter to share photos of the event, with one photo showing a single officer checking identification: My flight from SFO to JFK. We were told we couldn't disembark without showing our \"documents.\" pic.twitter.com/9ugQspTqeX \n— Anne Garrett (@annediego) February 23, 2017 \nAnd, in another Twitter user’s photo, a second officer is visible: These are customs agents forcibly checking the ID of every passenger deplaning from Delta flight 1583 tonight at JFK. A domestic flight. pic.twitter.com/fHMgyzCjo5 \n— Britton Taylor (@brittontaylor) February 23, 2017 \nDelta has declined to issue comment regarding flight 1583, and while we’re waiting to hear back from Homeland Security, Gothamist was able to get a response from a CBP representative, who said that the ID checks are “not a new policy.” Additionally, according to the representative, it is “not unusual for [CBP] to assist our fellow law-enforcement agencies.” \nThat last bit doesn’t quite check out — there didn’t appear to be any TSA or police officers present, and it seems unlikely that they weren’t available when the flight arrived at 8:01pm. Hopefully this was an isolated incident, but we’d like to hear from you if you’ve encountered such an ID check during your domestic travels. \nHave you run into CBP officers following a domestic flight? \nFeatured image courtesy of Ramin Talaie via Getty Images.
