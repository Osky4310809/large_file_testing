Schumer's opposition comes minutes after Sen. Bob Casey said he would also oppose Gorsuch. \n\"After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court\" Schumer said, adding the Supreme Court nominee \"was unable to sufficiently convince me that he’d be an independent check” on Trump. \nSchumer also said that Gorsuch is \"someone who almost instinctively supports the powerful over the weak.\" \nThe Senate Democrat leader also announced that Democrats will filibuster Gorsuch and force Republicans to muster 60 votes to advance him to a final up-or-down vote. “He will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation. My vote will be 'no' and I urge my colleagues to do the same,” he said on the Senate floor. \nIt was unclear as of now if Republicans would use the \"nuclear option\" as some have suggested in retaliation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:30:46.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
