Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com)   3:19pm Nadine Lustre in La Union Instagram/Nadine Lustre \nMANILA, Philippines — Was actor James Reid angry at his girlfriend Nadine Lustre for her daring social media pictures? \n“No, he’s not conservative. He’s actually very happy kasi alam n’ya yung process na pinagdaanan ko to look good. It was really, really hard. I’m proud that I made it,” Nadine assured during last night’s Pond’s event in Taguig City. \nShe thinks there is nothing wrong with the photos she posted, though many netizens found them provocative and insinuating lovemaking, for which the celebrity couple was under fire following their car love scene in their recently concluded prime time soap, “Till I Met You.” \n“Natural lang naman po na kapag nasa beach, natural lang na naka-bikini ka. 'Di ko naman inexpect na ganun yung magiging reactions ng mga tao,” Nadine explained. \nBy eating right, working out at home, and going to the gym with James almost every morning, Nadine was able to achieve her desired beach body. \nShe is happy that it has been a year since she became a Pond’s girl, which enables her to share her story and self-esteem struggles. A lot of her fans, she said, wrote to her to affirm that they can relate to her story.   \nShe is also excited to welcome Kathryn Bernardo as new endorser for the beauty brand. She looks forward to bond with Kathryn soon. \nSimilarly, she is ecstatic to be nominated for a Nickelodeon Award together with other Kapamilya actresses Liza Soberano and Janella Salvador. \n“If ever ako man ang manalo, I’d be super grateful sa lahat ng bumoto at lahat ng nag-hastag,” she enthused. “It (the award) will be a good thing to inspire kids.” \nInstagram/Nadine Lustre \nNadine in La Union Instagram/Nadine Lustre \nNadine in Palawan Instagram/Nadine Lustre \nNadine in Tali Beach Instagram/Nadine Lustre", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:10:14.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
