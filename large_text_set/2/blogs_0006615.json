Farren — managed to maintain a calm demeanour throughout the altercation. We're pretty sure he would have no problem protecting himself if it came to fisticuffs too. Just look at the pint size of the angry man. \nAccording to Farren (a creative director at video game publisher Ubisoft), the video doesn't show the part where the young man was pushing the Starhub staff member around. Adding that he's made Singapore his home for nearly five years now, Farren says this was his first brush with racism. \nKudos to you, good Sir. And nah, you don't look fat — just big boned, probably.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:57:36.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
