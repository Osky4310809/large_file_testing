You invest so much emotionally, only to realise that the other person was never really as involved as you were in the first place. It is hurtful, and can really piss you off. While there is no such thing as putting people you date in categories of being a cheater and a non-cheater, there are some facts (backed by research too) that can help you figure out if the relationship is truly worth it. These are just signs, and can differ in every relationship, but they can be great indicators too. So watch out. 1. His friends are in committed relationships \nIn M. Gary Newman's book, The Truth About Cheating , he points out that if his friends are trust-worthy and in a committed relationship, chances are he will be too. If you think about it, we are deeply influenced by the friends we have, so this makes a whole lot of sense. If he is surrounded by people who think that cheating is cool or okay, he might be thinking along the same lines too. 2. He's made you meet his friends and family \nIntroducing you to people that he is close to indicate that he trusts you, and intends to stick around for longer. If you know his close friends, and have met his family or even his siblings, rest assured that he is thinking long-term and wouldn't really mess this up. 3. You are both \"working\" it \nA recent sociology study conducted in US indicated that partners are less likely to cheat if they both fall in similar income brackets. The feeling of being equals with each other, keeps out other negative feeling like jealousy and loss of confidence - both big parameters for cheating. 4. He trusts you completely \nBecause he is doing no wrong, he assumes that you aren't too. It might sound like a simple thing, but a hundred per cent open, trusting relationship is quite a big deal. So if you find him trusting you, you can give back the same vibes. 5. He just doesn't seem like a cheater \nYour gut is the best friend you'll ever have. According to a study published by Brigham Young University, you can totally trust your gut to indicate whether or not he/she looks like the kind of person who would cheat. So, if your gut is telling you all is okay, it probably is.
