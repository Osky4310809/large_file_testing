He’s extremely competent.” \n“But, look, his term extends for some time yet. There’s no plans at the moment in changing that term.” \nUnless fired, FBI directors serve a 10-year term under federal law and Comey was appointed by former President Obama in 2013. \nHillary Clinton blamed Comey for her election loss after he reopened the investigation into her misuse of classified emails less than two weeks before the election. \nComey told Congress he reopened the case because new, related emails were discovered on a laptop used by former Congressman Anthony Weiner who was under FBI investigation for reportedly soliciting sex from a minor. \nWeiner was then married to Clinton insider Huma Abedin. \nOther insiders said that Clinton would have asked Comey to resign if she was elected, despite the political ramifications.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T20:47:53.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
