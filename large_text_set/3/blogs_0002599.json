While playing for the Knicks in 2012, Stoudemire was fined $50,000 by the NBA for using a gay slur in a direct message to a fan on Twitter. \nStoudemire announced his retirement from the NBA last July, signing a one-day contract to retire as a Knick . A week later, however, he signed a two-year deal with Hapoel Jerusalem, a team he co-owns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:59:02.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
