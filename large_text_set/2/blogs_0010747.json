He is learning Spanish!\" \nStriker Costa, born in Brazil, competed for his adopted country at the 2014 World Cup and at Euro 2016. \nAnd Azpilicueta said: \"He wants to win the Premier League with us and I don't see him, like you say, learning Chinese. \n\"I really hope he stays for a long time. He is giving so much to the team, not just goals. He helps create play. He is a reference player for us.\" Diego Costa has been linked with a move to China. \nAzpilicueta added, however, that playing in the Chinese Super League was a temptation for many footballers. \n\"It's a new market and there are many players that have decided to embark on that adventure,\" he said. \n\"Each player has his own personal circumstances and different situations in his respective club and he makes that decision.\" \nBrazilian midfielder Oscar left Chelsea for Shanghai SIPG earlier this year in a Â£60 million deal . \nAdriana Garcia is a Valencia-based football writer who covers La Liga for ESPN FC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:51:03.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
