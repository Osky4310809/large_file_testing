The triumph is clearly visible in everyone’s demeanour and it was justified simply because the win is likely to be massive and the opposition party is virtually trashed, not just in Uttar Pradesh but also in Uttarakhand and possibly in Goa and also Manipur – however, BJP will lose in a major way in Punjab where Capt Amarinder Singh of Congress is set to become the chief minister again, displacing the Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal-led Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BJP alliance. \nAlso watch: \nBJP’s Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, who is a former Olympian shooter and current Union Minister today dragged the Congress through the mud, rubbing in the fact that the party has been beaten in a humiliating manner. Rathore said, “Congress ka haath paapon se kaala ho chuka hai, isey ab janata kabhi nahin sweekar karegi.” In effect, he said that the Congress hand (which is also its party election symbol) has been blackened by sin and the public has refused to accept it. This comment is a hard-hitting one but is quite apt as the Congress party led UPA government’s 10 years at the Centre was marked by a number of corruption cases that refused to go down. \nThe reaction of the Congress party was very much according to tradition – it kept its head buried in the ground and refused to recognise reality. Giving his view today after it became known tat Congress hd lost badly was senior Congress leader Rajiv Shukla, “We respect the mandate, but development has lost and votebank politics has won.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T08:39:30.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
