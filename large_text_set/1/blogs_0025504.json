'Talking to his grandson' \nKo Ni had just embraced his young grandson as he stepped out of the airport terminal on his return from Jakarta, said the lawyer's daughter Yin Nwe Khine. \n\"My father was talking to his grandson. Then, I heard a gunshot. At first, I thought it was a car tyre blowing out, then I saw my father lying on the ground,\" she said. \nKo Ni, an expert in constitutional law, had spoken out about the powerful role the military retains in governing Myanmar, despite handing over power to Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian administration in April. \n\"My father was often threatened and we were warned to be careful, but my father didn't accept that easily. He always did what he thought was right,\" said Yin Nwe Khine.
