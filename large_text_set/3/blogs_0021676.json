The homeowner is “up for a laugh,” declared Steve. And he might just be on to something because the listing has been getting a blitz of media attention since he had a mystery man dress up as a parrot and model the available home, which he is hoping to sell for £225,000 (or $277,762.00 to us American layman). 2 \nAccording to Steve, “We’ve already done a couple of viewings. We always like to think we do some of the best photography of the estate agents in the area.” \nBut buyer beware, Steve admitted that the bird does not come with the purchase of home, so rein in expectations. 3 \nThe 3 bedroom semi-detached house comes equipped with:– Stunning views. High-quality finishes.– Amazing gloss black kitchen – with granite work surfaces.– Magnificent outdoor entertaining area, featuring granite terraced patio, with decked seating area.– Three reception rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T01:45:52.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
