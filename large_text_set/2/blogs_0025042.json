Posted Feb 22, 2017 MORE Source: Trans pride flag, open source \nToday, the Trump administration’s controversial appointees, Jeff Sessions & Betsy DeVos, withdrew federal guidance on how schools should apply Title IX in regards to transgender students. The CNN headline, “ Trump administration withdraws federal protections for transgender students ” is misleading – the federal protections (Title IX) still exist. So what do folks who care about protecting transgender youth need to know? Revoking guidance does not revoke the law . The guidance in question was a “Dear Colleague Letter” that provided advice on how to interpret and apply Title IX and included a resource guide distributed to schools in May 2016. Although this guidance was incredibly clear and strengthened efforts to improve practices in districts nationwide, it didn’t actually change the law. Title IX has been in effect since 1974 and prohibits sex discrimination in any educational institution receiving federal funds. It has been applied in cases as early as 1999 ( Davis v. Monroe ) to protect students from sexual harassment by their peers and was applied in cases in 2000 ( Ray v. Antioch ) and 2005 ( Theno v. Tonganoxie ) in ways that would support a broad interpretation to schools aiming to protecting transgender students from discrimination. Check your local protections . 13 states & many other school districts have local laws and policies that already provide these protections. There have been state-level decisions in Colorado (2013) and Maine (2014) that have already granted access to school facilities and services based on a student’s gender identity . Pay attention to the SCOTUS case . The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) is going to hear a landmark case on the interpretation of Title IX for transgender youth this March. G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board will be the first case of its kind to make its way to the higher court. The way the current 8 justice bench interprets and applies Title IX will have greater impact than the withdrawal of this guidance. Use research and best-practice literature to educate . Share reliable information with your neighbors, local educators, and friends. A growing body of research shows how affirming transgender youth and allowing them to socially transition (using the name, pronouns, facilities, and programs that align with their gender identity) when they are ready greatly improves their mental health and overall well-being. Although this is a set-back, the research and best-practice literature which many professionals and legal cases rely on still tells the same story. Affirming trans youth saves lives.
