At the young age of 25, the fashion editor boasts a portfolio of collaborations that include legendary photographers Steven Klein and Alasdair McLellan, editorial sittings with top models Coco Rocha and Naomi Campbell — “Naomi was five hours late to our shoot, but she was on fire and managed nine looks in just under an hour,” shares Danyl. From studying art in Toronto, to cutting his styling teeth in New York, to then producing 12-15 covers for the international editions of the various L’Officiel publications, how does a young Filipino go from zero to 60 in an industry as competitive as fashion publishing? Danyl Geneciran shows us how. \nAlternating between Toronto for school, the various fashion capitals for networking, then ultimately New York to build his portfolio, Danyl Geneciran ran the gamut of publishing work to get where he is today. “Graphic design was always there,” shares Danyl, having built his book with internships at V magazine and Women’s Wear Daily . “I would always start within the art department at my internships, then slowly transition into being a contributing writer or a fashion assistant. I built my fashion knowledge there.” \nBuilding the bedrock of his career by producing personal shoots and contributing to a host of magazines, Danyl continues his fashion career, post-grad, as a creative director for TOM* magazine, a Toronto-based bi-annual menswear magazine, and is also as a contributor for the Jalou Media Group or the L’Officiel brand of publications. On the beginnings of his journey as a fashion editor, the breadth of his portfolio, and if working with top-tier names in fashion still shocks him, Geneciran sits down with YStyle for a quick one-on-one. \nYSTYLE: Thank you for taking the time to sit down with YStyle. Can you tell us very briefly about your background in publishing? \nDANYL GENECIRAN: The whole journey was rough and unintended. I’d say I was (first) exposed to the publishing world while I was still in my first year of university. Every summer, I would intern at various magazines — non-fashion related, just to build my book in graphic design (I was laying out pages). The turnaround didn’t take effect until I landed an internship with V magazine in New York City after my second year in school. \nI was in the art department but I would take part in the whole process of producing content, and specifically enjoyed fashion shoots where I would voluntarily assist photographers and stylists. I didn’t know anything about fashion back then, but my editors were kind enough to demonstrate things. And I guess I just grew from there — I fell in love with fashion and committed my time to research and practice while doing graphic design. I knew then that I wanted to pursue fashion, but wasn’t sure what area.   \nWhat was your journey towards becoming a fashion editor like? \nJust like any job, becoming a fashion editor means having the passion for it as a source and then you take it from there. Although connections and selling yourself is everything, you also need to be good at it, and work hard for it. \nSeeing the breadth of your portfolio, such as the various covers of international editions of L’Officiel / L’OfficielHommes , TOM* magazine, L’Optimum , etc., do you remember a specific moment that you would consider as your breakthrough? \nEvery cover shoot is an honor as editors really trust your ability. No specific breakthrough moment, but one of the most overwhelming feelings was getting hired as an international fashion editor for seven selected editions of L’Officiel , with a contract of producing 12-15 covers plus 15 inside stories a year. That was a breakthrough for me. \nHow would you describe working as a fashion creative in New York City — not to mention for a big international franchise like L’Officiel ? Does the access come easy? Working with top models, Hollywood personalities, photographers, etc.? Or is it all still surreal for you? Fashion nerds want to know. \nWorking in a fashion capital is always competitive. There’s always someone better than you. You don’t have friends. You fight with fellow editors. You fight for your ideas. It pushes you to hustle and you can’t be lazy. Don’t even try. Yes, L’Officiel does have easier access to getting anyone and anything, but again, you have competitors which clients or celebrities would prioritize ( cough, cough, Vogue ). \nAs an editor and a stylist, what do you look for when you’re creating a fashion image? How would you describe your creative process? \n\nI like fashion images that are genuine, real and raw. I usually start with an inspiration, expand it with references and then get a team with similar aesthetics as me. For L’Officiel , I try to push for fashion images that are confusing and quiet awkward. It may not be good for the market, but I think the market will slowly adjust. \nHaving your work run the gamut from L’Officiel Germany and Thailand covers, to running a Toronto-based men’s title like TOM* — can you walk us through a typical day? How do you manage your time? \nA typical day mostly consists of arranging my calendar, ideations, overseeing a team and editing. No specific time schedules. It’s messed up. I don’t know how I do it. \nI understand you’re spending some of the next month here in Manila. Can you share a bit about of what you’re up to? \nInitially, I came to Manila for vacation and to escape winter in America. I’m still working on few things remotely for L’Officiel , but also I’ve been able to work on a few projects in Manila. I’m always open to anything that keeps myself busy. But lately, I’ve been chilling and meeting new people. \nHow does being Filipino thread itself into your narrative as a stylist? Did it or does it continue to have an impact on your point of view? \nI guess growing up in a humble Filipino environment and working in the international fashion scene is a totally different culture. Fashion still shocks me even up until this day. But I’m all about experience and explorations. And having this inner Filipino — hardworking, driven, with strong principles — pulls you up to knowing your limits, while still making an impact. It’s quiet humbling. \nWhat more can we expect from Danyl Geneciran? \nNothing specific, but wish for change. \nPhoto by PATRICK DIOKNO | Sittings by FRANCINE GACRAMA | Shot on location at TENANT MANILA  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:13:19.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
