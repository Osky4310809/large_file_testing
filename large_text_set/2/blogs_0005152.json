In ordinary times, nominating Mr. Abrams would set off tremendous opposition, especially from the left. But Mr. Trump’s many promises during the campaign to upend decades of bipartisan foreign policy doctrine, as well as a series of phone calls and meetings in recent weeks that left allies feeling insulted, led many experts to applaud him as a man who could put the Trump administration on a more predictable path. “For the most part, I think he would be welcomed in the State Department,” said Dennis Ross, the senior Middle East adviser under President Barack Obama. “He’s seen as serious, responsible and knowledgeable.” Mr. Abrams’s nomination would be the beginning of an important process to fill out the State Department’s top ranks. The Trump administration, as is common, asked nearly all of the Obama administration’s political appointees to leave their posts, including some seen as vital to the day-to-day management of far-flung operations. \n  But the speed of their departures, before they could hand off their duties to successors, was jarring. So was the arrival last week of Matt Mowers, a young former political aide to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, as a senior White House adviser to the State Department, which added to growing unease that the White House would be pulling the strings at the department. While Mr. Abrams did not sign either of two letters from former officials who said they would never work for Mr. Trump, he once told the Voice of America that Mr. Trump had “no appreciation whatsoever of the importance of allies and alliances.” He wrote an article in The Weekly Standard titled “When You Can’t Stand Your Candidate” — ostensibly a look back at the 1972 election — urging that the Republican convention not be “a coronation wherein Trump and Trumpism are unchallenged.” But Mr. Abrams’s years of direct experience in government are seen as an important asset for Mr. Tillerson. And his thick skin from previous battles could help if Mr. Tillerson seeks a wholesale revamping of the department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:11:08.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
