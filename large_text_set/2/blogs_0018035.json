I think some people are clearly upset. But there is a bit of professional protester, manufactured base in there.\" Senior Republican accuses protesters of being paid, receives invoices \nHe added: \"Just because they’re loud doesn’t mean they are many, and in a lot of cases, I think that's what you're seeing\", arguing that the town halls were not a true representation of the voter base in each district. \nHe previously told Fox News that protesting had become a \"profession\", implying it was a paid activity. \nIt echoes frequent attacks from his boss towards protesters, accusing them of being paid by billionaire George Soros. \nThe President tweeted that the \"so-called angry crowds\" were \"planned out by liberal activists\". The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2017 \nMr Trump's and Mr Spicer's remarks come amid a wave of anger and protests at Republican town halls around the US. \nThe movement gained traction this month with Jason Chaffetz , chairman of the committee on oversight and government reform, attending an event in Utah. \nHe was shouted down, booed and jeered, with the audience chanting: \"Do your job!\" New York City bodegas strike to protest Trump's travel ban New York City bodegas strike to protest Trump's travel ban 1/27 \nEthnic Yemenis and supporters protest against President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Yemen on February 2, 2017 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.
