The European Economic Community entered the history books when it became the European Union. \nNow, Brexit is making its own place in the history books, and hopefully it will be successful enough to be used by conservatives for years to come as one of the great efforts made to prevent global government eroding the sovereignty of independent nations. \nPlease share this story on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about this story.
