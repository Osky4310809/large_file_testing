Godwin Obaseki and Ize-Iyamu \nThe appellants, in their petitions before the election tribunal, are challenging the declaration by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, of Mr. Godwin Obaseki of the APC, as winner of the election. \nThe appellants, in their application before the tribunal, had requested a recounting in the open court of ballot papers used in four councils namely Egor, Akoko-Edo, Estako West and Estako East, to prove their case of electoral irregularity. \nHowever, the Justice Ahmed Badamasi-led three-man tribunal ordered the stoppage of the recounting, when only three of the four councils had been counted. \nThe tribunal claimed that it made the order because the petitioners’ statutory 14-day period to prove their case had lapsed. \nA report by the Assistant Secretary to the tribunal, Buhari Sani, showed that the recounting was only concluded in Wards 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Etsako West, Wards 1 and 2 in Akoko-Edo and Ward 1 of Egor councils. \nBut the petitioners, who claimed that the stoppage of the recounting would be fatal to their case, approached the Court of Appeal, seeking for an order for the conclusion of the recounting. \nINEC, Obaseki and APC opposed the appellants’ application and urged the court to dismissed it. \nMeanwhile, APC filed a cross appeal and argued that the tribunal ought not to have granted the request for a recount in the first place. \nMallam Yusuf Ali, SAN, counsel for the petitioners in adopting his address to substantiate his case, argued that several decided Supreme Court cases supported his claim that the tribunal erred in stopping the recounting. \nBut Oyiyen Anumoye, INEC’s counsel, Chief Wole Olanipeku, SAN, representing Obaseki and Prince Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, for APC, in their adopted addresses, opposed the appellants’ application and asked the Appeal Court to dismiss it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T06:59:44.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
