The reason will shock you and have you wondering just how sane these Trump critics are. \nDonald Trump Jr. posted the photo of his 2-year-old daughter Chloe on Twitter and liberals were quick to point out that she was wearing a hat with the lovable “Sesame Street” character Ernie on it. Why would this have liberals angry? Well, we can’t get into the full psychological breakdown of why a child wearing a hat could make these liberals so angry because it literally makes no sense, but we can show you some tweets that try to explain their childish behavior. Oh Chloe!!! Always the cutest. Hardest thing in the world is to not spoil the last of my little monsters. #family #familytime #kid #time pic.twitter.com/SbZsZjGLd0 \n— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 22, 2017  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T05:36:06.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
