(credit: NCPD) \nLONG BEACH, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — A Nassau County clergyman has been arrested on charges of possessing child pornography. \nPolice say Christopher King, a 51-year-old parish reverand at St. James Episcopal Church in Long Beach, was arrested Friday around 6:00 pm after an investigation revealed pornography involving children less than 16 years of age on his computer devices at his parish residence. \nAuthorities also found methamphetamine, Xanax pills, and numerous items of drug related paraphernalia at his residence. \nKing is charged with five counts of possessing a sexual performance by a child and two counts of seventh degree criminal possession of a controlled substance. \nIn a statement posted to the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island’s website, Bishop Lawrence C. Provenzano said King had been licensed as a priest at the diocese since 2001 and was currently serving as the priest-in-charge of St. James Church. \n“The diocese and the entire Episcopal Church have a zero tolerance police with respect to criminal conduct of any kind including the allegations made against Father King,” the statement continued. “As a result of the allegations, I have today terminated Father King’s license to function as an Episcopal priest in the Diocese of Long Island.” \nAdditionally, Provenzano says the diocese will provide pastoral care and consult with the congregation and any others impacted by the charges against King, who is scheduled to be arraigned in First District Court in Hempstead at some point Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:08:40.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
