That sent the No. 20 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota flying along the backstretch, making extremely heavy contact with the inside wall. \nAfter the wreck, Kenseth keyed the radio and said, “I’m OK, but I’m not sure if I’m as OK as last week.” \nAt Phoenix Raceway one week ago, Kenseth endured another hard wreck after a tire failure sent him into the outside wall coming out of Turn 4. \n“I didn’t do a good job of getting through the gears and it kind of got me in that spot,” Kenseth told FOX Sports after being checked and released from the infield care center. \n“The No. 1 (Jamie McMurray) got outside of me and I tried to leave enough room for him. We were three-wide coming out of Turn 2 and I just got hit in the left rear and got turned around.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:51:20.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
