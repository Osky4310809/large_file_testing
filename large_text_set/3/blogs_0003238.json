This item is the first of many new unique merchandise products coming as part of Pandora that will immerse Guests in their in-park experience like never before and connect them to this exotic new land. I caught up with Erin Herbst, merchandiser for Disney Pins, to learn more about this countdown collection.\n“With the addition of this new land to Disney’s Animal Kingdom, we wanted a way to continue the excitement leading up to the grand opening,” explained Erin. “This countdown pin collection features the beautiful travel posters created by Alpha Centauri Expeditions , the exclusive provider of tours to Pandora. We thought guests would love collecting these posters as they prepare to journey to another world.”\n\nThere will be one new pin released each month from March to May. The first pin in this collection (above left) will be released on March 2. The second countdown pin (center) will be released on April 6. The final individual limited edition pin (above right) will be released on May 4. Each individual pin will have an edition size of 1,250, and will be released at Discovery Trading Company in the park.\n\nArtist Dylan Cole designed the travel posters which inspired this pin collection. Attendees may recall getting a first look at the travel posters during the D23 Expo in 2015 . Dylan provided design work on Disney’s “Maleficent,” and is currently Co-Production Designer for the upcoming “Avatar” motion picture sequels.\nToday, guests may see these posters near Tiffins restaurant in Disney’s Animal Kingdom Park.\n\nThe final two pins in this collection, called “Completer pins,” will only be found in the five-pin boxed set containing all five travel posters. The boxed set will have an edition size of 250, and will be released during the opening of this new land on May 27.\nThere will be a purchase limit of two limited edition pins, per style, per guest, per release. These pins will not be available via Shop Disney Parks app or the Disney Parks online store.\nStay tuned to DisneyParksBlog.com in the coming months for additional looks at new merchandise created especially for Pandora – The World of Avatar!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:48:25.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
