(Photo: Kevin Winter, Getty Images) 28 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW YORK (AP) â€” Paul McCartney says he wants his music to get back to where it once belonged. \nMcCartney filed a lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday against Sony/ATV over copyright ownership of the many hit songs he wrote with John Lennon as part of The Beatles. \nThe copyrights were famously bought by Michael Jackson in 1985 and then fully sold over to Sony/ATV following Jackson's death. McCartney has long wanted the copyrights, and the filing says he has sent notice to Sony/ATV saying that he will claim them back under a provision of U.S. copyright law that makes that possible after a certain time. \nThe first song eligible to be claimed back is Love Me Do , in October 2018. The rest of the catalog would follow in years after, ending in 2026. \nMcCartney wants a ruling to say his claiming them doesn't represent a legal breach of any contract or publishing agreement that Sony/ATV could use against him. \nThe Beatles in May 1967 celebrating completion of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' in London.
