AFP \nWASHINGTON, United States — President Donald Trump teased a budget plan Monday that includes a nearly 10 percent increase in defense spending and a “large reduction” in foreign aid. \nPreviewing measures aimed at backing up campaign promises with dollars and cents, Trump promised a “public safety and national security” focused fiscal plan. \nAn administration official said that Trump’s plan would include a $54 billion increase in defense spending and a corresponding decrease in non-military programs. ADVERTISEMENT \n“Most federal agencies will see a reduction as a result,” the official said. There will be a “large reduction in foreign aid,” he added, speaking on condition of anonymity. \nTrump has put security threats front and center of his administration, insisting a muscular response is the only option. \nHe has promised to build a wall on the Mexican border, deport illegal immigrants and wipe jihadists off the “face of the earth.” \nHis budget proposal — which will be picked over and must ultimately be approved by Congress — doubles down on that ethos. \nIt would substantially increase US defense spending — already by far the highest in the world — although there were no details about how the extra funds would be spent. ‘Keeping Americans safe’ \nTrump claimed that his budget “follows through on my promise on keeping Americans safe.” \n“It will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it,” Trump said. \nRepublican Senator John McCain argued that the increase was less significant than Trump suggested, representing a three percent increase over projection for fiscal year 2018. \n“We can and must do better,” he said. \nBut others raised questions about the impact of planned cuts at the State Department and Environmental Protection Agency. \nForeign aid accounts for less than one percent of US federal spending and is not enough to make up for increased defense spending. \n“It is a fairly small part of the discretionary budget, but it is still consistent with what the President said,” Trump budget tsar Mick Mulvaney said. \n“We are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars.” \nMark Toner, the acting State Department spokesman, said the agency would work with the White House to review “budget priorities.” \n“The department remains committed to a US foreign policy that advances the security and prosperity of the American people,” he said. \nTrump’s comments come a day before he addresses a joint session of Congress — a crucial agenda-setting moment for new presidents. \nHis initial budget outline did not include proposals for mandatory spending or tax proposals, which make up the bulk of government outlays and receipts. \nThe budget is a keystone statement of Trump’s priorities for the coming years. \nThe nearly $4 trillion annual federal budget is a declaration of intent that puts the president’s policy goals down in black and white. \nIt also separates affordable campaign promises from the fanciful and is the final arbitrator after turf wars between departments and powerful interest groups. \nTrump has promised to cut waste and duplication in federal spending. \nUS president after US president has made similar promises upon coming to office, before delving into a text that runs in the thousands of pages and tossing the plan into the thicket of Congress. \nTrump has oodles of campaign promises to pay for, but faces a national debt set to hit $20 trillion on his watch and a deficit at 3.1 percent of GDP and rising. \nTrump’s promises — from building a wall on the Mexican border to stepping up the deportation of undocumented immigrants — carry an estimated price tag of $5.3 trillion, according to the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
