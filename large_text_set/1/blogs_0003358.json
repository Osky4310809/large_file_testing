The winner of the big battle royal will go on to main event WrestleMania each year, but what if there was a second match with a slight change? Well, a current number one contender on the Monday Night Raw roster spoke on the possibility of having a second Royal Rumble and if it could even happen in WWE. \nWhen in NXT, Bayley made a huge name for herself and quickly became one of the most popular superstars on the brand. Since heading up to the main roster of WWE, she has only built up her popularity and is now the number one contender to the Raw Women’s Championship currently held by Charlotte Flair. \nAs a matter of fact, Bayley will take on Charlotte Flair for that very title in a little over three weeks at the Royal Rumble . As the preview on the official website for WWE points out, Bayley hopes to capture her first main roster gold, but what if she had another way to get that chance? [Image by WWE] \nWhile prepping for her big upcoming match, Bayley took some time to speak with the Montgomery Advertiser Piledriver podcast about a number of topics. Obviously, the Royal Rumble was brought up since it is the next WWE pay-per-view (PPV) to take place, but what if there was a second battle royal to go down? \nBayley was asked for her thoughts on a possible strictly female match of this type, and she feels it has potential, but work needs to be done first. \n“I kind of honestly think we need a few more girls to do something like that because the guys have 30 men. We don’t have many girls. Even if it was Raw and Smackdown combined…I don’t think it would make it 20. If we had more girls brought in, maybe…like NXT girls, that would be really cool and I think it would be a lot of fun.” \nBayley has a very valid point in that there aren’t enough women on the main roster of WWE to have a 30-woman Royal Rumble , but it does seem interesting, to say the least. Let’s take a look at just who could be in the match if WWE decided to do one right now. \nMonday Night Raw :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T04:17:00.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
