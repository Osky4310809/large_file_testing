She shared the twice-as-sweet baby news with a gorgeous photo on Instagram , setting the bar pretty high for anyone planning a pregnancy reveal photo for social media anytime soon. And within 24 hours, Bey one-upped herself even more by releasing an entire album of gorgeous, elaborate, and epic maternity photos —many of which are underwater. And as the Internet endlessly praised the stunning shoot—and the crazy unique thought behind it—one woman chimed in to claim that Beyoncé's shoot wasn't quite as original as we thought—and it looks like she has the read receipts.

Excited about the similarity, Adams texted her daughter Jhalia Harris, 19, a student at Spelman College, to remind her of that pretty awesome fact. Consequently, Harris tweeted screenshots of their conversation because yes, it's similar, but also because it's amazing. And since Harris tweeted yesterday, they've garnered over 62,000 likes and over 22,000 retweets. https://twitter.com/popitforlola/status/827149328116506624 @popitforlola/Twitter Adams was clearly pretty excited when she realized this, to say the least. \"But who did it better?! YA MAMA DID. BEEN DID THE UNDERWATER SHOOT. CATCH UP BEY,\" she texted Harris. Looks like Mom could be on to something, right? When Allure.com reached out to Harris, she told us that her 'mom took these last year, in October. She was pregnant with my baby brother Giovani, who was born December 13.\" Harris added that her and her mom are both big fans of Beyoncé, but they think Harris's original shoot takes the cake. \"We both honestly love Beyoncé's shoot! My mom's shoot was just a little more popping, lol.\" More Queen B-related reads worth the click:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:10:37.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
