Lou Williams is having a solid year, but the Lakers are garbage and they don’t have much use for a bench gunner who plays the same position as one of their top young players and shoots more frequently than anyone else on the team. Getting a first round pick back for him is a great return. It won’t be a high pick, but scouts are high on this draft and the Lakers need all the young help they can get. Corey Brewer has been a bit marginalized this season, but maybe he can teach Brandon Ingram to run harder on fast breaks or something.

He’ll play point guard on a backup unit with Eric Gordon, the best bench scorer in the game, and he’ll add some more pop to that lineup. Williams gets to the foul line a ton, but he’s horrific on defense. In the playoffs, Williams could get picked on and he may have a harder time getting to the foul line. If the Rockets are theoretically gearing up for the Warriors, Williams is a pretty bad fit against their bench unit.
