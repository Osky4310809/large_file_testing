It cannot be business as usual. It is easy to see that we export timber, but import toothpicks simply because we do not have a steady and reliable supply of electricity to allow small and medium scale enterprises, SMEs, manufacture goods locally at competitive prices, thereby creating jobs for the growing unemployed population.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:48:01.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
