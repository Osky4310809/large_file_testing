As we trekked from restaurant kitchen to restaurant kitchen, the chef and I noticed that every Mexican chef we visited was using the same bulky appliance to make their sauces. It was a Thermomix, an overachieving machine that, according to the American website , \"chops, grinds, mixes, kneads, stirs, whisks, blends, emulsifies, steams, cooks, [and] weighs.\"\nAfter the fourth or fifth instance of seeing the Thermomix, the American chef couldn't take it—he bought one on the spot from a Mexican chef who had an extra. After taking it back to the U.S. (it comes with its very own carrying case, naturally), that chef became one of only a few cooks in the country to have what is essentially a blender that also cooks.\nBecause while the Thermomix is huge—commonplace, even—in places such as Mexico and Australia, an American model wasn't available until last year. And as far as I can tell, the Thermomix and its blending/heating brethren still haven't gained much traction here in the States.\nRelated The Cult Kitchen Tool That Basically Does Everything View article That might change now that All-Clad has come out with its own version. The Prep&Cook is identified as an \"all-in-one\" appliance, and it appears to work just like the Thermomix does: you chop or purée ingredients using the 12-speed food processor, then keep those ingredients right in the bowl as the appliance heats up and cooks them. All-Clad notes that the Prep&Cook also kneads doughs , whips cream , steams rice, slow-cooks meat, and stir-fries vegetables. (Over at the New York Times , however, the always-exacting Florence Fabricant found something the Prep&Cook can't do, noting that \"it cannot make neat shreds or slices.\")\nLike a lot of the new cooking appliances attempting to disrupt the market (I'm looking at you, Instant Pot ), the Prep&Cook has a control panel that looks capable of launching spaceships. (Or spying on Americans— does this thing microwave ?) And much like another wannabe disrupter, the June Oven , the Prep&Cook comes with its own book of very specific recipes. You don't have to use them, but, at least in the beginning, how will you know how to use the machine if you don't?\nThat learning curve is probably the biggest hurdle these machines need to overcome before they become as popular here as they are abroad. Well, that and the $1,000 price tag. Could a few weeks of fumbling and a cool grand be worth it? We're going to test run the Prep&Cook in the Epi Test Kitchen for a few weeks, so we'll let you know.\nCONTINUE READING tags: Gadgets All-Clad Food Processor Blender Tools", "external_links": ["https://thermomix.com/thermomix-state-of-the-art-machinery-specs/", "http://www.all-clad.com/prepandcook", "https://juneoven.com/", "https://www.wired.com/2017/03/kellyanne-conway-microwave-spying/"], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:14:25.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
