Woe be it to the next MP accused of misusing taxpayer-funded travel. \nThe ACTU is calling this Fair Work Commission decision the biggest mass wage cut since the Great Depression, and blaming Mr Turnbull, who is fully aware the service industry is fuelling much of Australia’s economic performance, even with Sunday penalty rates. \nBut the unions might not be happy with Mr Shorten, either. \nThe Opposition Leader was jammed into a penalty-rate corner during the election campaign last year and has found little additional space on the matter since. \nHis problem was that were there to be rates cut his only options would be to either damn the Fair Work Commission, to which he gave power over penalties when a minister, or meekly accept its decision. \nAt one point he attempted to escape that tight corner by saying: “Labor is the party of penalty rates.” \nEventually he had to concede he had just one option: “I said I’d accept the independent tribunal.” \nBut he also said: “The evidence doesn’t support it. It is not going to happen. When people ask me, what if? I am saying it won’t happen.” \nBut it did. While Mr Shorten was assuring voters rates wouldn’t be cut, the Greens said they would offer legislation to restore any lowered rates and today reaffirmed that. \nThe government is unlikely to make room for this legislation to be debated, but in the meantime will encourage intensive questioning of Labor as to its position. \nWould the Opposition back the Greens or stick with the umpire’s decision? \nIn a January speech Mr Shorten said Labor would not legislate to set penalties — leaving the job to the FWC — even though cuts would add to income inequality. \n“But if necessary, we would consider changing the rules, which guide the exercise of the commission’s discretion,” he said. \n“If the commission were to cut penalty rates for hundreds of thousands of already low-paid workers without sufficient compensation — leaving people worse off — Labor would not accept this.” \nJust how has yet to be fully demonstrated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:56:06.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
