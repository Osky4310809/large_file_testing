Erovinkin has been described as a key liaison between Sechin and Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nSteele writes in an intelligence report dated July 19, 2016, he has a source close to Sechin, who had disclosed alleged links between Trump’s supporters and Moscow.\nThe death of Erovinkin has prompted speculation it is linked to Steele’s explosive dossier, which was made public earlier this month.  Trump has dismissed the dossier as “fake news” and no evidence has emerged to support its lurid claims.\nThe Russian state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported Erovinkin’s body was “found in a black Lexus … (and) a large-scale investigation has been commenced in the area. Erovinkin’s body was sent to the FSB morgue.”\nNo cause of death has been confirmed and the FSB continues to investigate. Media reports suggested his death was a result of foul play. It was later claimed he died of a heart attack.\nJabin Botsford / The Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a press conference at Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 11, 2017.

Jabin Botsford, The Washington Post Christo Grozev, an expert on Russia-related security threats, said he believes Erovinkin is the key source to whom Steele refers in his dossier.  Grozev said on a blog: “Insiders have described Erovinkin to me alternately as ‘Sechin’s treasurer’ and ‘the go-between between Putin and Sechin’. One thing that everyone seems to agree – both in public and private sources – is that Erovinkin was Sechin’s closest associate.”\nGrozev, of Risk Management Lab, a think tank in Bulgaria, said: “I have no doubt that at the time Erovinkin died, Putin had Steele’s Trump dossier on his desk. He would – arguably – have known whether the alleged … story is based on fact or fiction. Whichever is true, he would have had a motive to seek – and find the mole … He would have had to conclude that Erovinkin was at least a person of interest.”\nRelated Former MI6 spy who wrote dossier on Trump defended as ‘a very competent, professional operator’ Former MI6 officer who wrote dirty dossier in hiding as Wall Street Journal reveals his identity Everything you need to know about the secret dossier detailing what Russia allegedly has on Trump Experts expressed scepticism about the theory. “As a rule, people like Gen Erovinkin don’t tend to die in airport thriller murders,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on the Russian security services.\nSteele, 52, remains in hiding following his unmasking as the author of the Trump dossier.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T17:45:33.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
