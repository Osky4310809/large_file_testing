If we can make world-class products like Oleum, we can also groom world-class talent.” \nOne of the beneficiaries of the programme, Bankole Bashiru, described his experience as transforming. “When we joined the academy we were all simply mechanics and apprentices, like any other person on the street but today I am very proud to say that we are now automobile technicians who have been trained to fix modern cars, and we owe this to OVH Energy,” he said.
