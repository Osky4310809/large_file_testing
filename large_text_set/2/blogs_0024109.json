They also remove the need to take your thumb off the right stick when you're say jumping or reloading, letting players stay in control at all times. There's also a comfort component to how a controller feels during extended play sessions. \nThe Raiju scored a few early blows on comfort and usability. The shoulder buttons felt much better placed than the Revolution's, and the curvature of the controller felt way more natural in my hands. I can't speak for you (or your hands) and it comes down to personal taste, but the Revolution didn't feel quite right to me. \nThe silicon grips and thumbstick pads meant it felt great to use. I wasn't a huge fan of the mechanical face buttons -- the Nacon won out on that front -- but it was easy to get past that with the excellent trigger and macro placement. Razer's Raiju also has a panel of control buttons across the bottom that let you switch between 2 user profiles and reprogram your button mapping on the fly. Enlarge Image Dave Cheng/CNET \nThe Revolution lets you program up to four different profiles, including button mapping and thumbstick and trigger sensitivity, the tradeoff being that you need to do so by hopping onto your PC (no Mac functionality, sadly) and tweaking the settings there. \nIn fact, the Revolution is the more customisable of the two. The trade off is that you need to spend extra time doing it. It's got two internal compartments that can house weights to get the balance right. You can change the actuation windows on the triggers and the rumble intensity. It's got double the number of custom profiles as the Razer. But you need to use the app to do it. \nBoth the Razer and the Nacon step things up over the regular DualShock 4 controller, that much is clear. Yes, this is like the \"Rocky 3\" freeze frame ending. If we're talking personal preference, I gravitated towards the Razer Raiju. If extra button mapping profiles and audio quality is what you're after, the Nacon's for you.
