Women tend to be the ones managing their husbands’ care, driving or accompanying them to doctor appointments and therapies that eat into a day. Women’s lower wages and family responsibilities have always batted them in and out of jobs — and in and out of the labor force — with much more frequency than men. A sick child or a family emergency can quickly push someone out of a job. And as wages, particularly at the lower end of the scale, have stagnated, the payoff from working decreases, as does the level of attachment. Women who ended their education at high school graduation, or earlier, dropped out of the labor force at even greater rates than their male counterparts between 2000 and 2015, according to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But what has noticeably changed is the degree to which men’s work patterns are increasingly matching women’s in that they are regularly cycling in and out of the work force every few months. Stability and security are ever more elusive.

To some analysts, the single-minded focus on sidelined men without a closer look at women has placed too much attention on the failings of potential workers instead of the quality of the jobs. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story They argue that the combination of missing women and relatively limp wage growth point to a weak economy as the primary culprit, and not, say, the heavy consumption of painkillers or video games. “I’m sure the quality of jobs is part of the story,” said David Madland, a senior adviser on the American Worker Project at the liberal Center for American Progress. “It’s got to be worth your while.” Both women and men complain they are unable to find full-time, secure jobs that pay a middle-class wage. Krystin Stevenson, for example, needs to solve her child care problem, but echoing the comments of many men, she also does not want to settle for just any job. “I have two degrees” — a bachelor’s in public relations and an associate degree in human services — “so I don’t want to work at McDonald’s or Jiffy Lube,” she said. In the meantime, she has been paying the bills with a combination of family help, savings, child support from a former partner, temporary unemployment insurance and food stamps. For others, whether men or women, who may be getting by on a disability check with health insurance from the government, a minimum-wage job without benefits isn’t all that appealing when it fails to add up to much more. Before the recession, for example, Tonya Pinkston, 43, had a full-time job at a warehouse logistics company and a part-time position at night at a post office near her home in Lawrenceville, outside Atlanta. After a diagnosis of lupus, and with a kidney condition that requires dialysis treatments three times a week, she is now on disability. “If I could find something flexible, I could work part time,” she said. Her health has stabilized, but she is cautious. A friend with lupus who went back to work as a custodian when she felt better ended up losing much of her government assistance, including a housing subsidy and Medicare . Now she is starting to get sick again, missing work and at risk of being fired. “I was like, ‘Oh, no, I just don’t want that to happen to me,’” Ms. Pinkston said. “She didn’t think about the long haul.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:29:58.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
