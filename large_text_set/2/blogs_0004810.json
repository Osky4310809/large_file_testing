This was back when photography was a new art, and he clicked these amazing frames between 1857-1865. \nHis most famous subjects were his 4 wives, who constitute most of his collection that was found in the City Palace of Jaipur . He liked to capture within the photographs, the culture and costumes of his people. The king was known to be seriously interested in clicking everything that caught his eye and spending hours in the laboratory, developing the pictures! \nHis wives, visiting dignitaries, important visitors, others members of the harem, even fakirs ... he trained his lens on everyone, taking the most stunning portraits of them. As is quite clear, thanks to his choice of his art, the king was quite modern in his way of thinking. Under his reign, the city of Jaipur saw numerous changes like schools, museums, water works, gas works and other new developments. \nThanks to his photographs we get a glimpse of his Royal world, which is absolutely fascinating. Have a look at this forgotten, past world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:40:01.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
