Sadly this was not to be. \n“I wish to thank my wife Rosanna and all my family for their never ending support during my time at Leicester. My thanks go to Paolo and Andrea who accompanied me on this wonderful journey. \n“Mostly I have to thank Leicester City Football Club. The adventure was amazing and will live with me forever.
