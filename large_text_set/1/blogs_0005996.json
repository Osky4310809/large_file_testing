It's FREE and always will be! \nKim Castillo and her son, Milo, have been regular patrons of Laurenzo’s restaurant in Houston, Texas. The staff has always been welcoming to her and her then 5-year-old son, who has Down syndrome. One Wednesday evening in 2013, the family were dining when one man and his family in the adjacent booth to the Castillos got up and moved further away. \nServer Michael Garcia didn’t think anything of it at first, but then he overheard the man say “Special needs children need to be ‘special’ somewhere else”, he couldn’t believe it. \nGarcia was upset and couldn’t hold back his feelings. “It was very disturbing. My personal feelings just took over and I told this man, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t serve you.’” \nThe family was taken aback and told Garcia they would leave, to which he replied “good”. When Kim heard how Garcia had stood up for her son, she was touched. \n“What went through my mind was that I was just so impressed and felt so good that somebody would stand up for another human being,” she said. \nGarcia was supported by the restaurant’s owners and praised by other customers as well. As one patron says in the news video below, the customer is not always right, most especially when they make such rude comments. \nPlease share Garcia’s kind act if you applaud what he did to stand up for Milo and his family.
