However, it also launched the Chromecast Ultra , a new and enhanced version of its streaming video HDMI dongle that didn’t get as much attention. Now the company has decided to lower the price of the Chromecast Ultra down by $10, from $69 to $59, for a limited time.\nSee also: How to set up a Chromecast with your Android phone December 15, 2016 Here’s a quick refresher: the Chromecast Ultra, like previous versions of the Chromecast dongle, can stream video and other content from your smartphone or from the internet. Unlike the standard model, the Chromecast Ultra can stream 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) videos, if you have compatible apps and, more importantly, a 4K TV or PC monitor. It also includes HDR and Dolby Vision support, and it supposed to be 1.8 times faster in loading content compared to the regular Chromecast. Finally, while it still has WiFi hardware, the Chromecast Ultra throws in an Ethernet port in case your TV is near your router and you want to take advantage of having a wired net connection.\nThe original $69 price tag might have been a tad too much for many people, even with all those hardware improvements, so cutting the price down by $10 to $59 might help convince folks with a 4K TV to grab it. The Chromecast Ultra is being sold at that price at the Google Store, Best Buy , Target and B&H Photo . The Google Store listing shows this $10 discount will last until March 4, so you don’t have a ton of time to snap it up at this reduced price. If you’re interested in taking advantage of the deal, head to any of the four links attached below.\nBuy now from the Google Store Buy now from Best Buy Buy now from B&H Photo Video Buy now from Target By the way, you can currently get the $129 Google Home speaker from the Google Store and save $15 off its price when you buy it bundled with any Chromecast model. That special promotion is slated to end on February 25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:27:55.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
