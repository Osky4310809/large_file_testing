Or at least it was until that fascist Trump showed up! \nMaria Danilova and Sadie Gurman, Associated Press: \nTransgender students on Wednesday lost federal protections that allowed them to use school bathrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identities, as the Trump administration stepped into a long-simmering national debate. \nThe administration came down on the side of states’ rights, lifting Obama-era federal guidelines that had been characterized by Republicans as an example of overreach. \nIn other words, figure it out for yourselves. The Trump administration is stepping out of the debate. \nWhy in the world do we need federal protections to tell people where to use the toilet? Nobody has lost anything here. A few people insist on creating problems for themselves, but they can’t force the rest of us to care. \nIf you identify as one of the dozens of new genders we now apparently have, I wish you no ill will. I don’t really care where you go to the bathroom. I certainly don’t want you to have an accident because you can’t figure out which one to use. But if women and girls don’t want some dude taking a crap right next to them, it’s not the role of government to tell them to shut up. \nWhat the hell is wrong with you people? \nP.S.
