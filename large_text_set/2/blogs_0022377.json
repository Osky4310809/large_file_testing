Entering his prime at age 24-25, he’s started less than half of Real’s games thus far in La Liga and the Champions League (12 of 28), and he’s not had much better success in the cups either (4 of 9). With his contract set to run out in June 2018, clubs who were previously keen on him, such as Chelsea , are supposedly back on high alert. According to Spanish radio station Cadena SER , Isco's fate with Madrid lies in Zidane's hands. If the manager deems the player worthy, the club will offer a new contract. However, if Zidane thinks otherwise, or if Isco refuses to sign an extension, the club would likely be forced to sell this summer just to avoid the risk of losing him on a free next summer. However, Spanish newspaper AS claims that the clubs currently tracking Isco's contractual situation do not want to pay Madrid any transfer fees. Obviously, if Chelsea or Barcelona or Juventus or Arsenal or Manchester City could get him for free, that’s what they’d prefer. That said, Isco remains eager for more playing time to ensure his place in the Spanish national team for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, with the insinuation being that he’d want a move well before all that. Able to feature as a central midfielder, as a pure no.10 and even as a winger on either flank, Isco would certainly be an amazing addition to Chelsea. Potential bidding war aside, there’s even a chance for decent deal here, given his contractual situation and his somewhat lower value than what it may have been just a couple seasons ago.
