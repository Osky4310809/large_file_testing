AP Photo/Bullit Marquez \nMANILA, Philippines (First published March 28 at 9:26 p.m.) — The Commission on Human Rights said Tuesday that it is too early to conclude whether or not extrajudicial killings in the Philippines are sanctioned by the state. \nThe commission, however, promised that it will continue to work to \"shed light to the spate of killings that continue to happen so that accountability and justice could be served.\" \nCommissioner Gwen Pimentel-Galang, who heads the task force on EJKs and who is the sister of Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, said in an ABS-CBN report on Monday, March 27, that \"there is no such finding\" that the killings are state-sponsored. \nShe said in the same report, however, that \"the killings are still continuing and it's in an apparent vigilante manner and they are unknown assailants.\" \nBut the commission made clear Tuesday that it was \"premature for the CHR to draw any conclusion during the March 27 interview that either exonerates or condemns any State official and the institutions they represent, as well as private individuals or groups, regarding responsibility for the killings.\" \nIt also said that the commission has yet to come up with a definitive conclusion on the killings as the task force is still readying an initial report on 463 cases investigated between May 2016 and January 2017.   \nPimentel-Galang said in the CHR statement that \"our work in the CHR in investigating EJK cases nationwide with impartiality and truth as our guiding lights.\" \nThe Task Force on EJKs also asked for an end to speculations on whether the killings are state-sponsored or not until all cases are resolved. \nThe government — particularly the Palace and the Philippine National Police — have repeatedly denied that it condones extrajudicial killings. \n\"The extrajudicial deaths are not state-sanctioned,\"   Abella said in a statement in February in response to an Amnesty International report on drug-related deaths in the Philippines. \nThe deaths have also been explained as either done by vigilantes or by drug syndicates. The government has also accused critics who bring up the killings as being part of a campaign or a conspiracy to discredit   \nAmnesty International said in February that it found cases where police officers were involved in the killings either directly or through hired killers.
