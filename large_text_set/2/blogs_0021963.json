PNA \nDAVAO CITY, Philippines ( Philippines News Agency ) - President Rodrigo Duterte has asked the new Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) to clear the road of obstructions until Mindanao finds the way to peace. \n“I am urging the BTC to navigate the hindrances and obstructions at hanapin ninyo ang daan hanggang patungo ng kapayaan. Mahirap ‘yan (and find the road until you reach peace),” the president told the expanded 21-member BTC during its launch here Friday night. \nWhile there is a solution acceptable to everybody, the road to peace is a long journey, Duterte said, assuring the commission that he will always be there to support them. \n“Maybe in front of the Filipino nation, I will ask every Filipino to vote for it because it will make us a great nation, so I leave it up to you,” he said. \nOn Friday night, the president witnessed the launch of the BTC, which will craft the new Bangsamoro enabling law for the implementation of the peace accords with the country's Muslim groups. \nThe event was attended by more than a thousand people representing the Senate and House of Representatives committees on peace, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), government agencies, and stakeholders. Among them were Presidential Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza; Irene Santiago, chair of the Government Panel Implementing the Bangsamoro Accords; MILF chair Al Haj Murad Ebrahim; and MILF vice chairman for political affairs Ghadzali Jaafar.

Bigger table \nDureza said this signals the start of the work to come up with an inclusive Bangsamoro law that will truly reflect and address the clamor for genuine political autonomy. \nHe said it is another milestone under the Duterte administration that provides the golden opportunity of fulfilling a promise for peace in Mindanao. \nDureza urged all members and stakeholders to come together and support the BTC members, who have the competence to craft the law. \n“Hopefully, Congress approves it,” he added. \nThe presidential adviser however hinted the involvement of all stakeholders. \n“There is a bigger table where stakeholders are waiting to be heard,” he said, encouraging everybody to “stay the course because the road to peace is not a smooth road.” Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:46:05.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
