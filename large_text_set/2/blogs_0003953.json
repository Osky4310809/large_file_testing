The second half of the video ended with the woman and girl coming to a large wall with a wood door. They then push past the door to enter the United States. \nYou can watch the full ad below: \n84 Lumber was one of many companies to take a political stand in its Super Bowl ad, joining Budweiser, Audi and Airbnb , among others. \nThe privately held company sells construction supplies and building materials. \nHere’s what you need to know about the Pennsylvania-based lumber company: 1. Fox Rejected the Full Ad Because of It Could Be Considered ‘Politically Sensitive,’ the Ad Agency Said (84 Lumber) \nMichael Brunner, the CEO of the ad agency that created the commercial, told CBS Pittsburgh that they were forced to change the ad because of Fox. \n“Simply put, that was a spot that they didn’t think they would be willing to run during the Super Bowl.” Brunner later added on, “There’s some elements in it that are… can be considered politically sensitive… They are the host. We’re paying the dollars, but they are the host.” \nBrunner says he created the commercial with three goals in mind: to generate awareness for 84 Lumber, to create pride in the workforce, and to fill jobs within the company. \n“Ignoring the border wall and the conversation around immigration that’s taking place in the media and at every kitchen table in America just didn’t seem right,” said Rob Shapiro, the chief client officer at Brunner, the agency that worked with 84 Lumber to come up with the ad, told the Washington Post. “If everyone else is trying to avoid controversy, isn’t that the time when brands should take a stand for what they believe in?” \nThe Super Bowl ad was the first for 84 Lumber. \n“I still can’t even understand why it was censored,” Maggie Hardy Magerko, 84 Lumber’s president and owner, told the New York Times . “In fact, I’m flabbergasted by that in today’s day and age. It’s not pornographic, it’s not immoral, it’s not racist.” \nThe company spent $15 million on the ad, according to the Times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:15:47.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
