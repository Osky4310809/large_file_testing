It was fraught with political games and gimmicks that delayed his committee vote and his final confirmation vote. Alas, on Wednesday night, he was confirmed to be our top legal enforcer by a 52-47 vote; Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) broke with Democrats to vote for Sessions. Yet, while the attorney general took heat, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), the Senate’s only black Republican who supported his nomination, was bombarded by racist tweets by the Left. \nScott took to the Senate floor to deliver his remarks, where he referenced the hate that’s been hurled at him, even repeating some of the greatest hits, while keeping the ones calling him the n-word off the record. As a black conservative Republican, he knew that such hate would be hurled at him. “I’m used to being attacked,” he said. “It comes with the territory” (via Politico ): The 30-minute speech, which prompted congratulatory statements by Republicans and Democrats, was a distillation of the backlash he has received for supporting Sessions, who has faced accusations of racism for more than 30 years\nYou are an Uncle Tom, Scott. You’re for Sessions. How does a black man turn on his own,” Scott said, reading criticisms of himself on social media. \"Tim Scott ... doesn’t have a shred of honor. He’s a House Negro like the one in ‘Django.’” \nHe added, “I left out all the ones that used the ‘n-word.’ Just felt like that would not be appropriate.” \nBesides being called a disgrace to his race, Scott noted that since he’s viewed as being no ally of liberal America, he is therefore an enemy of black people. You all know this—it’s identity politics at its most toxic. So, while people say that Sessions is a racist, for which there is zero substantive evidence to support such a claim unlike the late Sen. Robert Byrd’s (D-WV) membership in the Ku Klux Klan, they should probably look at what’s hurled at conservatives that happen to be people of color. \n“House negro.” I would say that’s—what’s the word—oh, racist. \nAlso, it's the Senate GOP that have diverse staffs, not the Democrats . Scott has a black chief of staff, which is a rarity among Senate Democrats. He also mentioned this fact in his remarks. \n\"My chief of staff, the only — until three weeks ago, the only African-American chief of staff in the United States Senate out of a 100 is the chief of staff for a Republican,\" he said. \"The second African-American chief of staff in the United States Senate is the chief of staff of a Republican.\" \nDemocrats seem to be all talk, no action on the issue of inclusion and diversity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:11:57.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
