Some use it as a weapon of political dissent , and i ts fruity topping may even have been the motive behind one of the most famous unsolved mysteries in American history. \nAnd now, pineapple pizza is back in the news in characteristically bizarre fashion. According to local news site Visir , President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson of Iceland said that if he had the power to do so, he would ban the dish across the Scandinavian island nation of 323,000. \nThe despotic statement was made in response the to a student who asked him what he thought of the controversial combination during a high school visit in Northern Iceland, triggering Iceland’s own (decidedly less creepy) version of Pizzagate . \nNot long after the president’s comments were made public, # PineappleOnPizza began trending on Twitter, reigniting an old and futile debate about the validity of the fruit as a pizza topping.
