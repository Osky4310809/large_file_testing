The company dropped the plan in 2015.\nIn November 2016, a jury held that Walmart owed the drivers backpay and handed down a $55 million verdict against the company for failing to pay about 850 of its truck drivers all of the compensation to which they were entitled.\n“While we still disagree with the jury’s verdict in the case, we’re pleased the judge declined to award any additional penalties,” Walmart said in an emailed statement.\nU.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco previously ruled that Walmart violated California law for not paying its truck drivers minimum wage for all work performed. Illston left the determination of damages for trial.\nLawyers for the drivers had asked Illston to award an additional $80 million in penalties and damages.\nWalmart said that its drivers were among the highest paid in the industry, earning about $80,000 to over $100,000 per year, adding that drivers were paid in compliance with California law and often in excess of what California law requires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T08:12:19.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
