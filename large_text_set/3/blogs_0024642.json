In case you forgot, the twosome called it quits on their marriage back in November after the reality TV vet accused the DJ of cleaning out their bank account .\nRelated: Lala Kent Regrets Some Of Her Plastic Surgery! \nObviously things got emotional, as the filming of this reunion was the first time the SUR server was able to confront her soon-to-be ex since wrapping season five. Not to mention, in the sneak peek (below), Scheana accuses Mike of cheating on her. *Gasp*\nOf course, that's not the only drama teased in the trailer as the reunion is airing in three parts. Be sure to ch-ch-check it out for yourself (below)! \nWill YOU be watching part one of the reunion when it airs on Bravo on April 3??
