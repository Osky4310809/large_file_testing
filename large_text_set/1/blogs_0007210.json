You don't have to have to put in a lot of effort to get a luminous complexion. These small hacks will give you a glow-from-within, instantly.

But use it once a week if you have sensitive skin. Add a dewy drop \nYou need constant hydration. Apart from sipping on water, make sure you add a few drops of your favourite face oil. Even if you have oily skin you can use coconut oil to instantly brighten up your complexion. Concentrate on vitamin C \nUse a serum packed with vitamin C. It is one of the best ingredients for us lazy girls. It brightens skin, evens out skin tone, and helps protect against harmful UV rays. Win, win, win. Go for a creamy flush \nA healthy, beachy glow isn't about the time spent basking in the sunlight. Swipe a luminious cream blush on the apples of your cheeks for an energetic, post-run vibe.
