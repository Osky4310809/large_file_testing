This year, they gave us the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZs. The XZs is supposed to appeal to the budget crowd who still wants decent specs, while the XZ Premium is attempting to be as premium as it gets, with 4K display and Snapdragon 835. \nThe XZ Premium is designed with front and back glass panels, along with a thin premium body and a classic Sony design with IP68 water resistance. This phone will certainly look familiar to anyone familiar with Sony’s phones. In a way, it’s much of the same from Sony that we see year after year, which I’m not sure is the best thing for a company struggling to sell phones. Let’s move on before we digress too deeply. \nThe XZ Premium does feature a whole bunch of goodness, once you get past the design. You’ve got that 4K display I mentioned, along with a Snapdragon 835 and a new 19MP Sony Exmor camera that supposedly captures stuff the eye can’t see. It does super slow motion at 960 frames per second in 720p and has 19% larger pixels. Sony included high resolution audio playback as well, along with quick charging. \nSony’s XZ Premium will launch in black or chrome in “late Spring.” I hate to be a downer again, but Sony’s phones almost always launch incredibly late here at incredibly high prices. If we’re talking “late Spring” for a global launch, that probably means a late Summer launch in the US. This phone does have high-end specs that should carry it through the year, but in 5 or 6 months, will you care? Sony Xperia XZ Premium Specs Rear: 19MP 1/ 2.3” Exmor RS, f/2.0, 1.22um Front: 13MP 1/3.06” Exmor RS, f/2.0 Memory 156 x 77 x 7.9mm 6.8oz Next Story LG Mobile Chief Confirms March 10 Launch for G6 in Korea, LG Pay in June SlyKrysis \n4K on a phone is useless: nobody can tell the difference until they are 1 inch from the screen, uses more battery, needless research and design time that can be utilized on a better feature (BATTERY!!!, CAMERA!, hello!)… all it does is make the brand use it as a bullet point for selling The Doctor \nNo fingerprint sensor here in the US. It’s already DOA. Asmodai \nAs if that’s their biggest problem in the U.S. I’d say a bigger problem is they don’t seem to ever launch their flagships on the largest network in the U.S… that’s going to kind of put a hurting on your U.S. sales. DER \nI doubt its a factor for many people, but the 960FPS is a huge factor for me. That is CRAZY…..all other phones are 240FPS at best. Battery seems a little small….but everything else looks pretty solid…even those chins. like a fat chinese prostitute. . Oh wait. I’m on Verizon…..nevermind. I litterally have 3 choices for phones. S8, G6 or iphone. Thanks Verizon for the great variety. FML. Harry Balzania \nUhhh….Moto Z Force? Battery of that fucker is a BEAST……you give up before it does lol DER \nI had that phone for a couple months. I like the Mod options, but they are expensive. Camera is average at best. And I get bored way too quick with stock-ish Anroid. Battery is super solid but still barely got me through the day. I use my phone a TON for work. johala02 \nAs I understand it Xperia XZ Premium will have basicly the same price as the upcoming Galaxy S8 (According to the rumours) Yes its very expensive but in line with the competition. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nTop and bottom bezels are huge but I’ve always loved this design from Sony. But this device is going to be ridiculous overpriced. jak_341 \nToo much chin and forehead. Design fail. Dave Brown \nI’m assuming this wont work with Big Red. I didn’t see anything on the carrier Mrhug3 \nSadly, I think that ship has sailed. After the Z2 failed, and the Z3 was scrapped before it made it to market, no chance for VZW. All I’ve wanted was a non-forked version of Sony’s flagship since I’ve been on VZW. Year after year I’m left with disappointment. DER \nZ3V on Verizon was one of my favorite phones. I would LOVE to have a new Sony phone on VZW Mrhug3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:05:41.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
