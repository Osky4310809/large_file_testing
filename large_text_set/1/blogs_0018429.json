The combined budgets of the NEH and NEA account for just over .002 percent of federal discretionary spending. \nBoth organizations administer grants to support the arts and humanities in each congressional district in the country. \nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis recently released a report that attempts to put a dollar amount on the arts economy and its impact. They found that arts and cultural production contributed more than $704 billion to the U.S. Economy -- this accounts for 4.2% of the United States GDP and is greater than the contributions of the construction ($586.7 billion), transportation and, warehousing ($464.1 billion) industries. \n\nMore than 4.74 million people were employed in arts and culture economy as of 2013, according to the BEA study. \nSince these jobs are funded by a combination of businesses, private donations, and government spending it's hard to say how many employees would be impacted, but eliminating the 2,300 grants from the NEA and 882 projects funded by the NEH in 2015 would put a strain on the arts and culture economy. \n“The announcement that this is even under consideration casts a sinister cloud over our vibrant national culture,” said Suzanne Nossel, executive director of PEN America in a statement on Thursday.\n“This proposal sends shivers down the spine of all Americans who value research, scholarship, and creativity and who recognize the mortal blow that eliminating these vital agencies would strike at the heart of treasured sectors of our society,” Nossel said.\nWith massive exports of U.S. entertainment, the arts and culture sector is a win for American trade. The industry ran a trade surplus of $24.1 billion in 2013, according to the BEA.\nDefunding the NEA would also cut already-scarce resources for the arts in underrepresented and low-income communities. According to the agency , 40% of the activities it supports take place in high-poverty neighborhoods.
