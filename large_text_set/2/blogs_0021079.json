Gomez posted a clip of the song on her Instagram story , teasing the line \"I had a dream/We were back to 17,\" and, of course, Jelena-shippers quickly put it together that Gomez met Bieber at 17 . A post shared by Selena Gomez Updates ⭐️ (@selenamgomezfanss) on Feb 3, 2017 at 1:57pm PST Advertisement - Continue Reading Below When the full track came out last Thursday, it played like the final \"it's over\" message to Bieber (who, at the time, was making headlines for being petty about Gomez's new boyfriend The Weeknd ) with its chorus \"Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?/Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?/Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?/Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?/It ain't me\". Most Popular But while the track might sound like an intimate page out of the never-ending Jelena love story, the bulk of the song was penned by a team of three writers: Ali Tamposi (from Reservoir ), Brian Lee, and Andrew Watt. As Tamposi explains, their song sparked something in Gomez when she listened to it and agreed to sing it, perhaps because it reminded her of her past relationship. \"When she heard it, she knew,\" Tamposi tells ELLE.com. \"She heard the writers on the song, and I think at that time in her life, the song spoke to her.\" Here, Tamposi explains how the song came to be (the trio had last worked with Gomez's ex Bieber and DJ Snake on \"Let Me Love You\"), what Gomez is like when she's songwriting (\"she was willing to tap into a place that is scary…to really be honest with her lyrics\"), and what she actually thinks of the song's Bieber connection. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below What did the process of writing \"It Ain't Me\" look like? I wrote this song with Brian Lee and Andrew Watt, and we pretty much have been writing everything together for the last year and a half. The first session we had together, we wrote \"Let Me Love You\" for Justin Bieber. So we got called into a session to work with Kygo, and Brian, Andrew and I had just come back from a month in London working with Rita Ora. It was such an incredible time out there with her, and we were just nailing song after song after song. When we got the call to go in with Kygo, we just thought we had it in the bag 'cause we were flying, and it was good. We started writing a song that was just complete garbage at first, and I think the three of us knew it, but we were trying to salvage it. Kygo came into the room with his manager, and they were polite, but they weren't excited, and all of our egos kind of took a jab. When [they] left the room, we looked at each other and we were like, 'All right, somebody needs to grab the guitar, and let's do what we do.' So we kind of Fleetwood Mac'd it, and we had a guitar, and Brian started singing the melody of the chorus, and I took it from there and just started singing out the lyrics. We all individually connected with the message of the song and I feel like the places that we were in our lives during that time. We wrote the first verse and the chorus within 45 minutes and so then we had the engineer go out and find Kygo for another session. It took him a couple minutes to come back in—understandably so, because the first song wasn't that exciting so I don't think he was like, that gassed up about coming back in, but he came back in. He's so wonderful, and he's so polite. I was just observing Kygo the second we pressed the spacebar [for the new track], and he heard it back, and his eyes were just going back from left to right, like he was just mapping out how he envisioned the production work. He completely lit up, and that's the feeling that we were all looking for. It felt so good.

And I think that when she had heard that Andrew was a writer on this song, it sparked in her. I'm not exactly sure how the song got to her directly, but I'm guessing that had a little bit to do with it. When she heard it, she knew. She heard the writers on the song, and I think at that time in her life, the song spoke to her. \nI feel like I could connect with her in so many different ways—she's just an old soul, an old, beautiful soul with a baby face. Some people see the song as a statement to Justin Bieber because Selena's singing it. Was that part of the conversation? You had a song already written, but I see Selena was credited as a songwriter, too. Right, well, she allows people to really tap into [her] life. As songwriters, we have an idea of what the artist is going through, and sometimes we utilize that as an inspiration to try and connect with the artist. And a lot of the time, we're off, and it's not something that they want to say or they feel at the moment. And there's the few times that we are able to nail it. Selena and Justin both are two of the biggest, top-selling artists in the world, and so when we write a song that they feel like they can connect with, that's the most rewarding feeling. Bieber and Gomez in 2011. Getty I had the opportunity to go into the studio with her while she was recording it, and I feel like I could connect with her in so many different ways—she's just an old soul, an old beautiful soul with a baby face and has so much to say. Most Popular We actually started writing another song together while we were in the studio with Andrew Watt and I was really impressed by her collaboration, her ideas, how open she was and willing to tap into a place that is scary with having the power that she has over so many people—to really be honest with her lyrics. I can't necessarily say that this is the song directed at Justin, but I do think this is a song for her just displaying her strength as a woman in this industry and that particular place that she is in her life. She's gone through a lot of different challenges. And it's natural for any human being at her age to be going through the things she's been going through, but the difference is she's caught under a microscope. She can be shamed for her struggles. But she's really doing an incredible job at highlighting some of the battles she faces and utilizing them as strengths.

What meaning do you want people to take from it? It was very nostalgic. There's little things in the lyrics [me, Andrew, and Brian really related to], like \"I had a dream we were sipping whisky neat, highest floor, the Bowery\". Back then, when I used to drink, and I'd start in this relationship vibe, we were always at the Bowery, and we were good and high, it was high enough. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below I think the chorus has so many messages—especially right now, for this time period with this whole feminist movement. Men and women are starting to use their vulnerabilities as strengths. And we are able to use them as power and send a message. There's a difference between standing by someone through a really dark period in their lives and being their support system. But when it starts to bog you down, when you're constantly there for them, waking up on the dark side of the morning and rocking them to sleep and picking them up when they're drunk, it just weighs down on you. There's two elements of this song: There's reminiscing over a time of your relationship when it was light and it was beautiful, and there was magic there. And I think that sometimes it's so hard—we get caught up and then it's tough. The belief that we can get back to that place if we just stick through it, but when we grow as human beings, we change and evolve, and we grow apart from each other. There's a time when you have to step away from something and you're not gonna take this fall of somebody else and put it on yourself [so] you say, it ain't me. \nSelena's fearless. She'll say anything that she's feeling. You also mentioned you're working on another song with Selena. There's been a lot of teasing on her Instagram that she's coming out with new music soon. Anything more you can share about that? I'm sure that she's going to be putting out a record. I don't know when, I don't know the details of that. I'm so outside of the machine of the industry, I just go to the sessions and write the songs when I get told to. But I do know that she's writing and I know that she writes a lot. It seems like it's the start of [something]. She usually, based on how her releases go, she'll follow up with more music of her own. Selena posted this! She's in the studio  #GomezUpdate pic.twitter.com/SFVtifSx2H \n— Selena Gomez News (@MyLifeIsSelG) February 21, 2017 What's her work style when you guys are in a songwriting session? She's extremely collaborative and she has great ideas. We'll just talk. I've only had the chance to get in with her once, [but] I'm sure we'll be working together, hopefully, in the future. But she comes up with tons of ideas and concepts, and she's a really great writer. It just flows naturally, and we just write on the guitar. She's a dream artist to work with based on the risks she's willing to take and the things she's willing to say. She's not afraid of what the public is portraying. This is just my takeaway, but it seems like she's fearless. She'll say anything that she's feeling and that to me—[I feel] like a musical therapist in a sense where I am able to tap into those places and find things to write about and tap into those particular emotions.
