It cited an unidentified source for the summit plans, and added that Moscow is ready to agree to the meeting, based on comments from officials at the Russian embassy in London. \nThe paper, citing an unidentified adviser to Trump, told the Times that the president-elect, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, will meet with Putin at a neutral venue “very soon.” \nIn eyeing Iceland’s capital, Trump’s team may be hoping to recreate the optics of a Reagan-era nuclear agreement. Former President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, then general secretary of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party, held a two-day summit in Reykjavik in October 1986 to work on what eventually became a major nuclear disarmament treaty between the two superpowers in 1987. \nTrump’s transition team didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. \nU.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson traveled to Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 8, where he met with Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and the president-elect’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
