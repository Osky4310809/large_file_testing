Posted Jan 12, 2017 MORE Source: Gopal Aggarwal photo — Creative Commons License \nDo you have a spooky dog? This issue came up a few years ago when I found myself chatting with an Army veteran who had served as a dog trainer at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas. This facility has been training military working dogs since 1958. The Department of Defense Military Working Dogs Training School is really quite a large operation. At any given time you are apt to find more than 1,000 dogs being trained by a staff of 125 dog handlers from all branches of military service and he had been one of these. \nOver a cup of coffee he told me, \"The biggest reason why dogs are dropped from military service work is fearfulness. There are a lot of scientific tests that you can give to a dog that claim that they can figure out which dogs are too fearful to make it through the program, however the head trainer in our unit had his own method of testing. His testing procedure involved just a room which basically had nothing of importance in it except a metal folding chair. He always carried one of those metal clipboards with him. The test started when the dog was comfortably sitting beside its handler. Then without any warning, he would hit that metal folding chair with his clipboard three times. Whack! Whack! Whack! — It made an ungodly loud sound. Now of course the dog was startled (and so was the handler if this was his first time encountering this situation). The point was to monitor just how the dog reacted. Did he simply jump to his feet and maybe bark, or did he try to run and hide, or maybe he cringed and submissively urinated and so forth. Once the dog had been settled down a bit our trainer would then approach the dog (with his clipboard still in his hand) to see if the dog had calmed or was now still will reacting fearfully toward him. \n\"He used to say that he was testing for what he called the 'Spooky Dog Syndrome'. He told us that a dog that was rattled by those loud sounds and didn't calm down when it was clear that nothing bad was going to happen was going to be afraid of everything. He would tell us 'That kind of dog will be afraid of thunder, fireworks, gunshots, artillery sounds, close flying planes, you name it. In addition that kind of dog will be afraid of strangers and strange situations. That is the kind the dog who's going to whimper and whine when you step away from it, leave it in a kennel, or leave him alone in a room. And if his fearfulness is bad enough that is the dog who is going to bite one of your comrades or even you. A dog that is afraid of loud sounds is just plain spooky and unreliable.' He never offered us any scientific support for his notion, but it did seem to be the case that more the dogs who failed his loud sound test were problematic and many did not make it through the training course.\" \nI recalled this conversation when I ran across an article by a research team in Finland. It was headed by Katriina Tiira of the Department of Veterinary Biosciences and Research Programs, at the University of Helsinki and the report was published in the Journal of Veterinary Behavior* . This was a very large questionnaire-based study, partly done through the Internet and partly through various breed clubs in Finland. In total data was gathered concerning 3284 dogs of 192 breeds. \nThe questionnaire was monstrously long (18 pages) and it covered the dog's typical reactions to a variety of loud sounds including, fireworks, thunder, gunshots, leaf blowers, sirens, vacuum cleaners and so forth. The dog's owners also reported whether the dog had shown fearful behavior in a variety of situations, if the dog had ever been aggressive in a variety of circumstances, or had shown separation anxiety . \nAs you might expect with so many different variables and such a large sample of dogs the researchers used some fairly high powered and complex statistical analyses to figure out what was going on. However the main conclusion that one might reach from this data is that the \"Spooky Dog Syndrome\" might actually exist. \nBecause it is such a complex data set we will have to stick to the highlights. Fortunately, the investigators did a very clever thing which helps to simplify our analysis. Specifically the investigators divided the dogs into two groups. Dogs who had been reported as showing fear toward strangers or in new situations or unfamiliar places, or when confronted by unfamiliar dogs for 40% of the time or more were classified as being \"fearful\" while dogs who showed fear responses less frequently than that formed a \"not fearful\" group. \nSo was the Lackland military dog trainer correct in his presumption that noise sensitivity is related to many varieties of fearful behaviors? The data here seems to certainly confirm that idea. When we look at the dogs who were classified as being fearful it turns out that they are approximately twice as likely to also show high noise sensitivity and fear reactions to loud sounds. Furthermore if the dog was afraid of thunder, then it was also likely that the dog would be afraid of fireworks, and gunshots, and to a lesser degree also to other loud noises such as sirens and vacuum cleaners and so forth. \nThese same dogs with the high noise sensitivity were also twice as likely to show fear reactions toward strangers and new situations (in 40% to 100% of the occasions). Furthermore, roughly 1/3 of these fearful, noise sensitive dogs showed separation anxiety. \nThere is a particularly troubling aspect of the behavior of these spooky, noise sensitive dogs, and that is their tendency toward aggressive behavior. The noise sensitive dogs were significantly more aggressive to unfamiliar people and other dogs, although, fortunately, they were not more aggressive toward their owners. The owners observed that their dogs showed aggression by barking, growling, and approaching a stranger in a manner that suggested that the aggressive behavior seen in these dogs was defensive in nature . So the investigators concluded that it was the dogs overall fearfulness that was triggering their aggression. \nSo is there something that we can define as a Spooky Dog Syndrome ? Well it certainly appears to be the case that if a dog is afraid of one particular stimulus, such as a loud sound, that seems to be a good predictor that the dog will be afraid of lots of different sounds, as well as unfamiliar places, people, and animals. These dogs will also suffer from separation anxiety and have a higher likelihood of becoming fear biters. Technically, I suppose that we should say that fearfulness is a fairly generalized trait in dogs. \nAlthough I don't recommend that people go around banging metal clipboards against metal folding chairs to test the fear responses in dogs, it does seem to be the case that if you see a dog acting as if he was very frightened in one situation where loud noises are present then it is likely to be the case that the dog will act fearfully in a lot of other situations, many of which do not involve noise at all. \nStanley Coren is the author of many books including: Gods, Ghosts and Black Dogs; The Wisdom of Dogs; Do Dogs Dream?
