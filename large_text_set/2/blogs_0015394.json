These compact fire-starter pills make for great kindling and are super easy to make. \nThis video from youtuber MrGear shows you all the steps you need to know. Start by soaking several sheets of paper in water, then fold them in half and roll them up. Once you have a few rolls ready, stick them in a plastic syringe tube and press the plunger to squeeze out all of the water.

Keep some at home for when you need them, and stick some in your hiking and camping packs for when you head to the great outdoors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:22:52.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
