The tournament also includes Arsenal playing Bayern Munich in Shanghai and Chelsea facing Bayern and Inter Milan in Singapore. \nSpurs will play French champions PSG, the former club of manager Mauricio Pochettino, at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida on July 22 before travelling to Harrison, New Jersey to face Roma at the Red Bull Arena, home of MLS side New York Red Bulls, three days later. \nThey finish the tour on July 29 against Premier League rivals City at the Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. \nThe trip is a chance for Spurs to boost the brand in the USA as the club continue to search for a naming rights partner for their new stadium, which will also host NFL matches. Tottenham's new stadium in numbers \nTottenham have held discussions with several high-profile companies regarding naming rights, though a deal is unlikely to be agreed until nearing their moving-in date. \nOn Thursday, Tottenham will learn whether their aim to play their home matches at Wembley in front of full capacity next season will be approved by Brent council’s planning committee. Spurs undecided whether to hire direct replacement for Paul Mitchell \nThe Council officers recommended last week that the committee accepts the proposal. \nSpurs wish to have full use of the national stadium’s 90,000 seats for possibly all their home games, if they move to Wembley next term while construction continues on their new ground. Tottenham say they have until March 31 to inform Wembley whether they will spend 2017-18 there.
