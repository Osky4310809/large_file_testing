Now, fashion’s official arbiter of cool, Raf Simons, has tapped Klincewicz to lens a series of lo-fi videos, and you can watch the directors cut above, featuring a sumptuous soundtrack by Berlin-based DJ and producer Curses.\nCalvin Klein has been teasing clips on its Instagram all week, and now the video campaign featuring the entire cast of spring’s American Classics campaign is here in which Klincewicz captures eight off-duty models in a series of DIY-esque, impressionistic videos.\nKlincewicz follows the cast from Sitges, Spain, to Queens, Brooklyn, and Birmingham, Alabama, and these Super 8 portraits offer an intimate view on Raf’s new visual chapter at Calvin Klein.\n\nThe video above (one of 8) turns the lens on Lulu Tenney, who is known as simply Lulu in the fashion world. The enigmatic, New York-based model has quickly become something of a muse for Raf, having also opened his debut show for Calvin Klein at NYFW FW17. \nKlincewicz captures Lulu frolicking in a Brooklyn park, adding plenty of his distorted, psychedelic visual signature in the process. Meet the entire cast and watch all of the videos here and discover a sublime new era at Calvin Klein. Once again, Raf Simons proves he is wasting no time reinventing the brand’s aesthetic in every way possible.\nFor more fashion news, take a look at Blondey McCoy’s latest lookbook for his fledging label Thames London . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:53:21.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
