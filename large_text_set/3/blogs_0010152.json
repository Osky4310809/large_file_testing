There’s nothing funny about an assassination attempt on a president.”\nHe added that he didn’t consider the video artistic. The music video showed all human figures aside from the artists as clowns. It should also be added that Snoop in the music video did not kill off the Trump-like clown figure, but instead revealed the weapon pointed at the character dubbed “Ronald Klump” as a toy gun.\nCohen added that he would raise the same objections had former President Barack Obama been on the receiving end of Snoop Dogg’s video.\nRELATED: Retire?

Marco Rubio also condemned the video , calling it “dangerous.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T01:06:05.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
