Ochoa, Margarita's estranged husband, entered with a gun and told everyone inside to leave, excluding his wife. \n\"They were sitting there, apparently taking a break,\" said Vance Mitchell, a Pasadena police spokesman. \nSonia confronted Ochoa, telling him to leave. Instead Ochoa shot her once in the arm. Sonia ran out of her restaurant to a neighboring business, S&Y Groceries, to call the police. \nPolice arrived to find Margarita had been shot twice. She died at the scene. Sonia was transported to a hospital with a non life-threatening injury. \nThe man then shot himself, dying shortly after being transported by Life Flight to Memorial Hermann Hospital. \nFatal shooting in Pasadena Posted by Mike Glenn on Thursday, February 23, 2017 \nSonia has been active on Facebook in the last 24 hours since her sister and brother-in-law's death, posting a link to a GoFundMe page titled \"Margie's Funeral Funds.\" \nShe captioned the post, \"My sister might be gone but she still needs us. I lost my best friend and now my obligation is to take her (sic) of her babies, but I can't do this on my own.\" \nMargarita's Facebook page features pictures of her three children and recent marriage to Ochoa on Feb. 7.
