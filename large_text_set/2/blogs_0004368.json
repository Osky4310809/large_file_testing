Here’s a look back at the food and beverage commercials that we’ll remember from 2017’s biggest game: Best in Show: Coke In light of the recent refugee ban and the protests that are surrounding it , this commercial from Coca-Cola , showing a diverse set of people connecting with each other while “America the Beautiful” plays in several different languages, feels relevant and celebratory of the values that so many Americans are fighting for right now. The clip was actually created and released three years ago for the Sochi Olympics, but Coca-Cola wisely decided to share it again, at the start of the biggest television event of 2017. With its celebration of diversity, emphasis on music, atmospheric cinematography, and lack of narrative, “It’s Beautiful” is like a sequel to Coke’s most famous commercial, “ Hilltop .” Most Cinematic: Budweiser This year, everyone watching the Super Bowl learned that Budweiser was founded by a hot German guy who came to America in the 19th century. Like the Coke spot, this gorgeously filmed commercial — which takes a few creative liberties with the Adolphus Busch story — also has a strong connection to the issues of the day. Even though Budweiser spent the last week or so downplaying its political implications , “Born the Hard Way” is the kind of ad that’s designed to get people talking. Biggest WTF Moment of the Game: Snickers As promised , the candy brand produced the Super Bowl’s first-ever live commercial. This would be the best ad to put in a 2017 time capsule, because it stars Hollywood’s current favorite go-to guy, Adam Driver, and it has the manic energy of the internet’s best video memes — Vines may be gone , but the spirit of those odd little videos lives on in this clip. The live conceit is clever, too, but really, the only way you can tell that it’s not pre-taped is the fact that Driver says the score of the game at the start of the clip. Biggest Disposable LOL of the Game: Bai Christopher Walk e n and Justin Timberlake team up for a one-joke ad for flavored water that references an NSYNC song you probably haven’t thought about in over a decade. Bravo. Best Use of a TV Theme Song: Michelob Ultra This commercial for watery, low-calorie beer proves that you can slap the theme song to Cheers over footage of pretty much anything — in this case, clips of people working out — and it will still tug at your heartstrings ever-so-slightly.
