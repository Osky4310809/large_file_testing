Both committees are looking into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.\nSince July, the FBI has been conducting a counterintelligence investigation into Russia’s interference in the election and possible coordination with Trump associates.\nKelner released a statement after The Wall Street Journal first reported that Flynn’s negotiations with the committee included discussions of immunity. The lawyer described the talks as ongoing and said he would not comment on the details.\nRelated Who is ‘Source D’? The man said to be behind the Trump -Russia dossier’s most salacious claim Senate committee to question Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, over meetings with Russians Trump’s ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort secretly worked to ‘greatly benefit’ Putin government in U.S. A congressional aide confirmed that discussions with the Senate intelligence committee involved immunity. The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\nHouse intelligence committee spokesman Jack Langer said Flynn has not offered to testify to the committee in exchange for immunity.\nFour other Trump associates have come forward in recent weeks, saying they would talk to the committees. As of Wednesday, the Senate intelligence committee had asked to interview 20 people as part of the probe.\nIn his statement, Kelner said the political climate in which Flynn is facing “claims of treason and vicious innuendo” is factoring into his negotiations with the committees.\n“No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution,” Kelner said.\nIn September, Flynn weighed in on the implications of immunity on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” criticizing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her associates in the FBI’s investigation into her use of a private email server.\n“When you are given immunity, that means that you have probably committed a crime,” Flynn said during the interview.\nFlynn was fired from his job as Trump’s first national security adviser after it was disclosed that he misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition.\nIn the weeks after he resigned, Flynn and his business registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents for $530,000 worth of lobbying work that could have benefited the Turkish government.\nThe lobbying occurred while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. The Turkish businessman who hired Flynn, Ekim Alptekin, has told the AP that Flynn’s firm registered under pressure from the Justice Department.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:48:31.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
