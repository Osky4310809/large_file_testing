The candle has sold for £10 above the retail price - but is still a lot cheaper than the Jo Malone version Where can I get one? \nIf you're after one of Aldi's designer scents, but don't want to fork out over the odds, all is not lost. \nThe store has now announced that due to demand, the fragrances will be available to buy online from Tuesday 21 March - just in time for Mothering Sunday. \nAldi's joint managing director of corporate buying Tony Baines said: \"We believe that everyone should be able to afford the very best for their mums, without the luxury price tag.” \n\"In light of the overwhelming demand we have experienced, we are pleased to confirm that our Luxury Candle range will be available to purchase online at aldi.co.uk from Tuesday 21 March. Jo Malone's iconic range sells for £44 and above on the high street \n\"The range has been one of our most successful specialbuys and we’re delighted to ensure as many of our customers as possible can enjoy the stunning range that equal the quality, strength and performance of high-end alternatives, at an everyday low price.\" \nHe added that to ensure all customers benefit from the product, the candles will be limited to two per transaction.
