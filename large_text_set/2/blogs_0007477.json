Thursday, Friday and Saturday for a few hours each day, and only with a court-appointed monitor present.\nRobin, we're told, was upset because he didn't get to visit with Julian last Friday, because the monitor pulled the plug after determining Julian didn't want the visit. The monitor also cut short Robin's visit on Saturday , when he took his son to Kids World.\nRobin's lawyers asked the judge to allow him his visits without a court-appointed monitor. The judge rejected that request. Robin then asked that the court appoint a different monitor who could be more impartial, but the judge said no. And then Robin asked the judge to prohibit the monitor from changing or canceling the scheduled visits. Again, the judge gave the thumbs down.\nRobin is currently prohibited from having contact with ex-wife Paula Patton or her mother, and aside from the scheduled weekly visits he can't have contact with Julian. The judge issued the restraining order last week after Paula made claims Robin was physically abusive to her and the child ... Robin has denied the allegations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:50:08.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
