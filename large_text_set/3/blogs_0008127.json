More and more parts came up and the further we went, the more we found,” Daniel's father, Klaus Kristiansen, told a local news station . \n“We also found documents and papers in the pockets of some clothes,” Kristiansen said. \nNot only did Daniel have an excellent firsthand source for his school report, but he even got to take the day off school when police and bomb disposal excavated the site. \nWhile Daniel's find is remarkable, finding World War II-era bombs, mines, and other buried relics is a somewhat commonplace occurrence across Europe. Mines are frequently discovered across beaches in the U.K., and a pair of children unearthed a German mine last summer while playing on the beach in England.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:52:14.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
