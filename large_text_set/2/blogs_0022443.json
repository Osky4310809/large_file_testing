Citing sources, ESPN.com's Marc Stein reported t he \"Pistons have not committed to trading either player but have also not discouraged offers from interested teams for ‎the two most prized names on their roster.\" A slew of teams have reportedly contacted the Pistons regarding Drummond's availability, but none of those discussions have intensified with less than 24 hours remaining until the trade deadline. Drummond and Caldwell-Pope's Efficiency Ratings Player -0.2 Source: NBA.com/Stats According to the Detroit News ' Rod Beard , Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy told reporters Tuesday that Detroit hasn't had \"serious\" discussions about Drummond to this point. The Portland Trail Blazers are among the teams that reached out, but ESPN.com's Ramona Shelburne reported they \"quickly abandoned their interest when Detroit asked for Blazers guard C.J. McCollum in return.\" According to Shelburne, the Blazers consider McCollum an \"untouchable\" asset. Perhaps more intriguing is that the Brooklyn Nets have discussed a potential Drummond deal with the Pistons. However, there's no indication the two sides have held advanced talks. \"That's just the way the NBA is,\" Drummond said of rumors Tuesday, per the Detroit Free Press ' Vince Ellis . \"It’s all a business. Everybody's name going to be thrown around if you’re a high-profile guy. My name happened to be there. I'm not mad or anything like that. I'm here to play basketball. Whatever happens, happens, but I can't control that.\" As for Caldwell-Pope, Stein cited sources who said \"Detroit would expect at least one future first-round pick and front-line player in return\" for the impending restricted free agent. Based on the Pistons' steep asking prices, it's understandable that discussions haven't progressed substantially. There's still time for Detroit to pull a 180 on Thursday afternoon, but Van Gundy's track record suggests he'd rather stand pat than make a panicked move at the last second.
