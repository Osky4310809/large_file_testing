Apparently they were so special that he felt compelled to invite those supporters to various cabinet meetings he had scheduled. \nYou may wanna come around. It’ll be fun. We’re really working tomorrow. We have meetings every 15, 20 minutes with different people that will form our government…We’re going to be interviewing everybody — Treasury, we’re going to be interviewing Secretary of State. We have everybody coming in. If you want to come around, it’s going to be unbelievable…so you might want to come along. \nRecently, the president took criticism for having a security meeting about North Korea in the middle of his Mar-A-Lago club. Club members were free to take pictures and interact with White House personnel during this briefing, which invited concerns from those saying Trump was not handling classified documents and sensitive information with proper care. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:37:19.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
