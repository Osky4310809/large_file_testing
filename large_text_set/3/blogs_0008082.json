Vince’s second horn was partially cut, “which suggests that the criminals were disturbed or that their equipment proved defective,” according to a post on the zoo’s Facebook page .\nVince was one of three white rhinos kept at Thoiry. The other two, Gracie and Bruno, were not harmed and are safe at the zoo, the Facebook post read.\nWhile police are still investigating, Le Parisien newspaper speculates the horn was stolen to be sold on the black market , according to AP. Rhino horns can be sold for up to 40,000 euros. The suspects are reportedly still at large.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:44:28.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
