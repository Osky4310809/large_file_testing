Poor guy. Feb 4, 2017 9:00 PM \nIt is like a Madden cover. Feb 4, 2017 9:00 PM \nOver-rated. Feb 4, 2017 9:01 PM \nI think the chip on Brady’s shoulder just grew a few yards. ctiggs says: Feb 4, 2017 9:01 PM \nMatty Ice proved alot to me this year i will give him credit. Also, TO should have made the HOF #goNiners #NobodyhasitbetterthanUS 8oneanddones says: Feb 4, 2017 9:02 PM \nMatt Ryan: 3 playoff wins \nTom Brady: 3 super bowl MVPs \nCan’t wait for the game! PFT's Most Moderated says: Feb 4, 2017 9:04 PM \nThank goodness it wasn’t Tom Brady. So sick of that non-deserving, severely overrated, no-talent winning it. sidepull says: Feb 4, 2017 9:05 PM \nEnjoy it for the night…the GOAT and SB MVP is suiting up tomorrow and you know who it is. Its OK Matty to have butterflies…it being your first SB. Get with the GOAT after the game, get some tips, he learned how to make them butterflies fly in formation, long ago. celticsforever says: Feb 4, 2017 9:06 PM \nManning, Ryan and all these clowns can gather meaningless mvp awards all day long. Brady just gathers Superbowl trophies. \nThe mvp award is a joke anyways. Simply handed out by default to the QB with the best stats that year. Remember when AP rushed for over 2000 yards and there seemed to be no chance he would win the mvp because of some idiot qb??? \nHeck, one year I thing Suh should have won the mvp playing in Detroit. They would have won about 2 games instead of 10 because of him alone. jimnaizeeum says: Feb 4, 2017 9:08 PM \nLook at his playoff record, 9 years and 3 wins…two were this year. How does he have that nick name? Feb 4, 2017 9:09 PM \nAs long as the winner wasn’t suspended for part of the season for CHEATING. Feb 4, 2017 9:10 PM \nJust gotta get the ring now…. alleycat702 says: Feb 4, 2017 9:10 PM \nI agree with juice08: the timing of the presentation is absolutely terrible! They should present this AFTER the SB. \nThat being said, congregations to Matt Ryan. shadywarrior says: Feb 4, 2017 9:12 PM \nCongrats, glad to see this kid finally be who I thought he could be coming out of BC. Seems like a stand-up guy, and he balled out for 16 games, so I can’t argue with this. Wish Brady could’ve gone 16 and seen how it played out, but whatever, the real prize is up for grabs tomorrow. Should be a good one. Feb 4, 2017 9:12 PM \nWith alternative facts, Brady would have won. Feb 4, 2017 9:13 PM \nGood choice. ariani1985 says: Feb 4, 2017 9:14 PM \nBut turd nation said that error Rodgers would win in a land slide! Ready to eat crow fake stock holders?
