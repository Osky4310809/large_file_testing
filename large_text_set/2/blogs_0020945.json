(Hill and Marley would go on to have four more kids.) Well, that baby boy Zion is 19 now, and he just welcomed his own first child into the world. That means Ms. L-Boogie is a grandmother now. \nBillboard reports that Rohan announced the birth on Twitter earlier this week. The kid’s name is Zephaniah, and he is beautiful: JAH RASTAFARI MORNING \" In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. #ZEPHANIAH pic.twitter.com/DF6d4ftFU9 \n— ROHAN MARLEY (@Romarley) February 19, 2017 \nHill is only 41, so you shouldn’t feel too old upon learning this.
