Dollar Vigilante burns flags. Tells Americans to get assets out. by peterdiekmeyerc... - Feb 3, 2017 6:32 PM The Trump Administration’s big government, anti-trade and border wall-policies, have generated surprising support from Republicans, the Alt-Right, and even libertarians. \"Dear Leftist, You Need To Take A Closer Look At The Real 'Refugees' Before You Denounce 'Vetting'\" Feb 4, 2017 6:50 PM 0 \nSubmitted by Duane via Free Market Shooter blog, \nPlenty of mainstream media outlets have been critical of the Trump executive orders regarding immigration and “vetting” of refugees. There are too many to list, but I will use an excerpt from a U.S. News article to drive the general point home: \nWhen the United States accepts refugees from countries with a significant Muslim population, we undermine the anti-American hatred that underlies Islamic State group recruitment. Closing America’s door to Syrian refugees, therefore, is not only a heartless hiccup in our nation’s history, it also validates Islamic State group propaganda, advances the group’s agenda and drives refugees back into the arms of dangerous terrorists. By turning away Syrian refugees, Trump is plunging America into a national security nightmare. \nThe “fact-check” website Snopes (which has previously been outed as being heavily liberal-biased , being run by a “failed liberal blogger”) also gets in on the act, saying that Syrian kids aren’t holding guns, instead labeling them as “Pakistani” : \nThe above-displayed photograph, however, was not taken in Syria and does not show refugees. The claim that the children are orphans is also baseless, as well as the claim that the children are holding real guns. \n\nThe photograph was taken in July 2014 on Al-Quds (Jerusalem Day) in Pakistan. The description accompanying the photo on Alamy states that the children are “Pakistani Shiite Muslims” and are holding toy guns during a protest. \nIf there is one thing Snopes is correct about, it is that Pakistani refugees also need to be intensely vetted, and should be on the list of countries, possibly above others Trump listed. However, Snopes is mostly doing this to dispute the notion that refugees could be dangerous. Which, given the information that is out there, is willfully ignorant at best, outright malicious at worst. \nTake a closer look at the children from the opening image, in the below video: \nWithout question, they would just strike you as “cute children” who deserved a country of their own if you took away the guns and put them in a TV promo looking for donations. \nBut, Express makes it appear as though these are just “hopeless” children who are playing with toy guns , and that Western nations denying refugees entry into our nations are just awful. Do they realize just how easy it would be for one of these children posing with real guns and real ISIS training to slip in with the kids who deserve a place? \nI can already feel the next quote coming: “Those kids in Express’s slideshow were playing with toy guns, and even if the kids in the above video have real guns, they have no real training, and would never shoot anyone!” \nWell… when I said the MSM and the many immigration protesters were either willfully ignorant or outright malicious, I really meant it. \nThe below video is so graphic, I was hesitant to post it. But Free Market Shooter is not a “safe space,” and if you are looking for one, you’re in the wrong place. I will however provide one last warning – if you are squeamish, easily disturbed, or just plain scared of the truth, DO NOT WATCH THIS VIDEO, BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC. A description is provided below the video, if you cannot watch. \n\nFor those who did not watch, the video showed armed ISIS-trained children clearing a house methodically and professionally, just like a team of commandos, and executing ISIS detainees within the house. Funker530 originally provided the video , and their commentary is below: \nTake a good look at the world today. We have children in the streets of the United States throwing a temper tantrum because they believe that the politicians have failed. Maybe they have. They have failed them by allowing them to believe that they live in a world of sunshine and rainbows. \n\nPolitics completely aside, this video is a snap back to reality. This is the real world that we live in today as a species. Grown men are training children, some as young as six, to move through a house in a tactical fashion with live ammunition, having them kill actual living human beings. To put the cherry on the cupcake, they are recording it with some serious production value, and then uploading it to the internet to show the world that their children are ready to die for their cause. I don’t see you marching for women and children’s rights in Syria. \n\nWhile you whine and complain about social issues that are a moot point in our society, women and children are being raped and murdered around the world by maniacs. Take a look outside of your own safe space, and realize that the world can’t be the Utopian place you want. It isn’t possible, it is never going to happen. \n\nThis is why. \nIf you think this is all just a big production, you clearly have not watched the video. Children are actually delivering kill shots on real live people. This is not The Matrix – this is the real world, and it will never cease to shock and disturb you. \nSo, think long and hard next time you see that cute refugee kid in the video, and ask yourself – is it possible that this child is actually a trained killer? Whether its man, woman or child, is there any real way to know if someone coming from a war zone is just an innocent, or a seriously dangerous individual? \nFor the record I’m not certain if Trump has all the answers to the “refugee” question, and whether or not his immigration actions will actually be effective or not. I also realize that these actions are likely harming some innocent individuals who truly mean no harm. Certainly, he can’t just wave a magic wand and make the country’s immigration problems go away overnight, especially given how difficult it is to know exactly who is trying to enter into and/or emigrate to the USA on a daily basis. \nHowever, Trump is clearly aware that the world is a bad place, and is trying to do something to protect and safeguard this country from a very cruel world that very much means to do our citizens harm. At least he is not sticking his head in the sand and being naive or willfully ignorant about the truth, like our MSM outlets are doing every day when they denounce him just for trying something his predecessor didn’t. \nIf the protesters took the MSM blinders off, and saw the world for what it really is, would they really be so opposed to Trump’s actions?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:13:37.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
