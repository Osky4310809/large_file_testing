If the science demonstrating what it does to your body has not convinced you to avoid this health damaging beverage at all costs, consider the fact that human waste was found in cans of Coca Cola BBC reported that the contamination occurred at a Coca Cola plant in Northern Ireland and it is being treated as a criminal matter. Under current laws, the actual formulation of an unadulterated can of soda is considered perfectly legal, but soda assaults your health in myriad ways. The effects are immediate and regular consumption can lead to long-term health problems. While the criminal contamination of “food” products is a serious matter, this incident may draw some negative attention to Coke. Their original formula may not contain human waste, but it is laden with ingredients that are terrible for your health. Coke may be a joke but no one is laughing. Whether regular or diet, there is never a reason to drink soda. It is sugary slurry that is entirely detrimental to your health. The diet versions are free of sugar but full of toxic sweeteners. Any and all soda is truly deleterious to your health. Coke has made millions despite selling a product entirely bereft of value. Coke’s greatest coup was convincing millions that their sugar-laden syrup was an appropriate beverage for any occasion . This masterstroke launched a multibillion-dollar business and wrecked the lives of millions. Fortunately, the tide has turned sharply against these hazardous beverages, but the soda industry is unlikely to go down without a fight. They rely on slick marketing and new markets to bolster sales. The soda companies also retain considerable influence in the halls of government. It is inevitable that some residual demand remains for their harmful wares. The best way to fight them is education. Consumers empowered with health knowledge are not as easily manipulated by the slick advertising pitches of the junk food giants. Soda sales are in a death spiral as customers turn up their noses at aspartame and sugar-laden beverages. If you have recently cut back on or eliminated soda from your diet entirely, congratulations! You deserve to be proud. Sales of carbonated soft drinks have dropped for the 12th consecutive year in the U.S. The message is spreading that soda is a health disaster. We're winning the war against the junk food and beverage industries. Check out my nutrition plan for additional information on how to remove all processed foods from your diet.
