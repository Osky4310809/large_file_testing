Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito form the more conservative wing, while Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer fill out the traditionally more liberal wing. Anthony Kennedy is considered a moderate and swing vote. \nObama picked Garland to fill the seat after Scalia's death, but the Republican-controlled Congress never held a vote on the nomination. The stalemate caused frustration for Obama in his final year in office. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly promised a conservative justice to replace Scalia, and Gorsuch largely fits that bill. \n\"The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent,\" Trump said at the third presidential debate in October. \"They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that's very, very important.\" \nEven with a strong track record and qualifications, Trump's nominee will likely face a battle to get confirmed. One Senate Democrat, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, has already threatened to filibuster Trump's nominee, calling the judgeship a \"stolen seat.\" \nThat would mean Republicans would need 60 votes to confirm the justice. The party holds 52 seats. \nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., previously said he would oppose the nominee if he is not \"mainstream.\" \nAnticipating the battle, Republicans began warning Democrats against blocking Trump's choice on Tuesday. \n\"It's my sincere hope that our friends across the aisle will join us in thoughtfully reviewing and considering the next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday. \nThe White House also has gone on the offensive about potential efforts to block the nomination. Press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that \"the default is if you're qualified for the position, then you should be confirmed.\" \nSome Democrats may call foul on that characterization due to Garland's nomination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:13:24.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
