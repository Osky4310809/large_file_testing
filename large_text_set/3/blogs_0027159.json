At least a little bit. A new study has linked moderate drinking to a lower risk of certain heart conditions. Long Story \nAlcohol increasingly seems to be in the crosshairs of public health and legislators in the West. In the United States, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has recently warned about America’s growing dependence on booze. In the United Kingdom, there are currently calls to lower the legal drink-drive limit, while Australia has implemented draconian late night lockout laws for Sydney pubs and clubs aimed at curbing alcohol-fuelled violence. \nBut it turns out not all booze is bad — at least when you don’t drink all the booze . Researchers at Cambridge University have conducted an analysis of the medical records of 1.93 million healthy U.K. adults and found that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk of several cardiovascular diseases. Scientists say men who drink beer daily reduce their risk of heart attack. As for livers, scientists said \"fuck livers\" and then high-fived. — Chase Mitchell (@ChaseMit) March 28, 2012 \nModerate drinking in the United Kingdom is described as as no more than 14 units (112 grams) of alcohol a week. To put that into context, there’s typically one and a half units of alcohol in a glass of wine. \nThe result backs up earlier links between moderate drinking and better heart health when compared to heavy drinking or abstinence. It also defies more recent skepticism of this very idea. Critics were concerned that previous research had shortcomings in terms of grouping non-drinkers with former drinkers who may have been forced into abstinence due to poor health. \nBut using what’s known as CALIBER (Clinical research using Linked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records), a huge online data resource, the authors of the new study were able to drill down to a greater level of granularity, separating non-drinkers from former and occasional drinkers and ensuring that all subjects were free from cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. \nAnalysing the individual health records, researchers found that moderate drinking , when compared to abstinence, was associated with a lower risk of first presenting to a doctor with several cardiovascular conditions, such as angina, heart failure and ischaemic stroke. 22 year old me after a night of drinking: \"I hope I didn't do anything stupid.\" \n29 year old me: \"I hope I didn't agree to go on a hike.\" — Ian Karmel (@IanKarmel) April 26, 2014 \nBut don’t take this as an excuse to get sauced before the weekend. The researchers instead recommend in a news release more conventional methods of lowering risks of heart disease, such as increasing physical activity and giving up cigarettes. And before you ask: yes, too much drinking was associated with a higher risk of first presenting to a doctor with cardiovascular conditions. \nAnd this is an observational study. It doesn’t tell us anything about what’s going on here. But it does set up the scientific community for bigger and better studies that will harness the same sort of big data.

Drop This Fact \nIn 2015, about 66 million American adults reported that they'd engaged in at least one episode of binge drinking in the previous month.
