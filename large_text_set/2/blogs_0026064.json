There’s not a lot of glory in this.” It’s rare to hear a political candidate gush about his opponents, but even weirder to see him act as a hype man in a series of promotional videos about them. But true to Amori’s self-invented “love party,” his affection for the other candidates is all part of his greater goal to raise political awareness and boost voter turnout — even if it comes at the cost of his own campaign. It’s enough to wonder: Does Amori even want to be mayor of L.A.? \n“I absolutely want to be mayor,” he assures me. But “the win is not the most important thing to me. It’s getting out and changing the way people play the game and thinking about politics and engaging those who have never felt engaged by the city.” That includes many of the people in the underground music and performance art scenes where Amori frequently serves as a curator and emcee. He says most of his voters wouldn’t have even known about the March 7 election if it weren’t for him. \nStill, he acknowledges that the content he’s creating on his Facebook and YouTube pages — including the videos he shoots on a near-daily basis in Skid Row — are in some ways an extension of his work at Incite Visual Media, the branded video company where he serves as president and founder. Colleagues and clients know him by his real name, Eric “Helix” Wolfson. The business has also allowed him to self-finance his campaign, which he estimates he’s spent at least $7,000 on. \nHe frequently cites Los Angeles’embarrassingly low voter turnout as a key motivator for the campaign: Just about 10 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot in the city’s 2015 election, and Garcetti won the office in 2013 with votes from just 12 percent of registered voters — a smaller total than any incoming mayor since the 1930s, according to the L.A.
