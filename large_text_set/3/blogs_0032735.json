Dazzling in some of the most stunning outfits, the stars are shining in their best. So, as hard as a choice it was, we picked three of the most beautiful ladies from last night who lit the red carpet! 1.Aditi Rao Hydari \nOne of the most underrated fashionistas of Bollywood, Aditi came in a bronze gown with a plunging neckline. The look was finished with minimal make-up and a sleek ponytail, which is Aditiâ€™s go-to choice. 2.Rekha \nIt is amazing how this lady manages to look like a dream every single time. The actress took a break from her regular golden-girl avatar, and picked up a multi-coloured banarasi sari. She maintained her regal self with some gorgeous jewellery and hair swept to one side. 3.Jacqueline Fernandez \nTaking the heat up a notch, the Housefull 3 actress went for a Catwoman-off-duty look, with a black shirt, a fringe detailed mesh skirt, finished with a choker.
