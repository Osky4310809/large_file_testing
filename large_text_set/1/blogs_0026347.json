That position has remained constant regardless of the political outcome, the board wrote, noting an editorial on the system in 2012 that states it “needs to be abolished.” \nBut the next day, the NYTimes ran a correction that went almost entirely unnoticed, stating the paper had in fact supported the electoral college when President George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election. “It failed to note an exception: in 2000, the board defended the college after the election of George W. Bush,” the correction reads, totally undermining the idea that its new opposition to the electoral college is not motivated by a distaste for Trump. \nThe corrected editorial glosses over the 2000 position against Bush, opting to rephrase the paper’s support for an overhaul of the system rather than concede that point in the editorial. The paragraph in question now reads: “This page opposed the Electoral College in 1936, and in more recent years as well. In 2004, President George W. Bush won the popular vote by more than three million, but he could have lost the Electoral College with a switch of fewer than 60,000 votes in Ohio.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:46:15.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
