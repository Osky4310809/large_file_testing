Not that things would have turned out so badly for the Blues. Look at Sevilla. \nThey’re flying at the minute in La Liga, outsiders to win the title. Only one point behind leaders Real Madrid, they’re expected to sweep Leicester aside in the Champions League. \nSampaoli set a record with Sevilla by picking up their highest points tally for the first half of a La Liga season (42). Having won the first of Chile’s back-to-back Copa Americas, he has an incredible track record. SAMPAOLI: “Estuve cerca del @chelsea pero luego apareció el @SevillaFC . A Monchi no le reconocí en el aeropuerto” pic.twitter.com/5FKQzhFsDU \n— El Transistor (@ElTransistorOC) January 23, 2017 Conte’s extraordinary start \nAfter an early wobble in his Chelsea reign, Conte bounced back in incredible style. The club have won 15 of their last 16 Premier League games, that includes a 13-match winning streak. They’re eight points clear at the top.
