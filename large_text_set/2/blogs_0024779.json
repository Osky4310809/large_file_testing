It looks like that was Ryan Gosling’s approach when losing the Best Picture win for La La Land during last night’s Academy Awards.\nPresenters Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty accidentally read out the name of the popular musical last night, but the cast and crew realized midway through their acceptance speech that an error was made . In fact, it was Moonlight that won the award.\nWhile most responded with shock (and, rightfully so) Gosling gave a big smile as cameras captured the group of talented filmmakers trying to figure out what exactly went wrong.\nRyan Gosling reacts as the true winner of best picture \"Moonlight\" is announced at the #Oscars . pic.twitter.com/QBRso3yHNJ \n— AP Images (@AP_Images) February 27, 2017 For the record, Gosling was smiling the entire night. And, based on moments in the past (ahem— his famous stint hosting Saturday Night Live ) we know that Gosling often has a hard time holding in giggles.\nStill, we’re so happy that Gosling chose to react the way he did. It truly helped break some of the tension.\nJust imagine how it must have felt to be on stage during that time — not only do these things very rarely happen on awards shows, but the entire cast and crew probably knew that they’d be answering questions about the error during every single post-show event.\nKevin Winter / Getty Images Gosling’s laugh and smile also proved that he’s not a sore loser. In fact, he was probably one of the most easygoing guys on stage.\nEven his co-star Emma Stone managed to credit his sense of humor during her own speech for Best Actress .\n“And Ryan Gosling, thank you for making me laugh and for always raising the bar and for being the greatest partner on this crazy adventure,” she stated in her speech. Gosling’s adorable reactionary moment, which happened later during the show, only proved that their crazy adventure isn’t over yet.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:53:59.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
