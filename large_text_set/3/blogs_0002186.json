No offence but I don't think I would ever see Gary Neville training in a Man City Training shirt,\" Simpson tweeted. \nCarragher responded by saying: \"More offensive than you lot running around on Monday?!!!\" \nThe Sky pundit's response was a nod to Leicester's impressive display in their win over Liverpool - just days after a number of Foxes players knifed Claudio Ranieri in the back by complaining about the Italian boss who was eventually axed. Simpson, left, and Leicester upped their level to beat Liverpool on Monday night (Photo: Getty) \nIn Simpson's response he appeared to refer to comments recently made by Carragher in which the Scouser said Leicester's players are \"not that good\" and described last season's title win as a \"freak\". \nThe Leicester full-back wrote: \"Come on Jamie it's your job to check them stats. Aren't we all just average players who won the best league in the world.\" \nCarragher retorted: \"Sorry if that offends you, I was talking about your careers as a whole. Great respect for what you all achieved.\" \nThe Anfield legend then went back in with another tweet, telling Simpson to 'get out of Gary Neville's a***' and questioning him about the circumstances surrounding Ranieri's King Power exit. Claudio Ranieri was sacked by Leicester last week (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \n\"If we're getting things off our chest did you go & see the owner in Seville?\" Carragher wrote. \nSimpson responded with a mocking comment about Carragher's failure to win the Premier League during his playing career. \n\"I respect your opinion, and as a defender I look up to you and what you've achieved. However i won the league you haven't,\" the former Manchester United player wrote. \nCarragher responded: \"Thought you had more? You part of those joke players at Man U who claimed titles after 5 games a season?!! Quiet on Seville Daniel.\" The exchange as it panned out poll loading Whose side are you on? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T13:48:52.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
