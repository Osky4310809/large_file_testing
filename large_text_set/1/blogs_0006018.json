Cleared to sign \nBecause a disagreement had arisen between Benfica and Lindelof’s former Swedish club, Vasteras, over the sell-on fee the latter would be entitled to in the event of the player moving again; Vasteras want 20% and it seems Benfica have been trying to negotiate a lower percentage. \nAccording to Swedish paper Expressen , Benfica and Vasteras have now reached an agreement on their payment, meaning Lindelof has the green light for his Old Trafford move.
