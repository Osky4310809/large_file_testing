Partnerships like this one have reinvigorated our nation’s apprenticeship system, creating opportunity and pathways to prosperity for hundreds of thousands of Americans that will last for years to come.\nAmazon is one of 200 employers, colleges, and labor organizations that have signed on to provide these types of internships. Currently, though, the list lacks the heavyweights of the industry including Facebook, Apple , Google, and Microsoft . Fingers crossed that they’ll get on board in the near future.\nAfter stating last May that he’d like to hire 25,000 veterans and their spouses over the next five years, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos seems to be putting his money where his mouth is.
