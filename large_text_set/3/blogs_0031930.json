Everything that we know must be passed on.” \nNeymar: Brazil attracting attention of Messi \nShould Messi be immediately suspended, he would miss the clash with Bolivia in La Paz, although a prospective appeal could yet see him take the field. \nCONMEBOL could also order the suspension to come into effect after the current international window, in which case Messi would miss at the very least August's visit to Uruguay in the next round of qualifiers. \nFinally, the committee could yet opt to disregard the amendment to the match report and allow Messi's outburst to pass without punishment. \nArgentina currently lie third in the CONMEBOL qualifiers, behind Brazil and Uruguay.
