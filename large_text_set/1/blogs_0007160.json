Seeing action for only a conference-low 28 minutes in their 118-93 win over Blackwater on Friday, the three-time PBA MVP was nothing but instrumental in unlocking a more deadly Beermen squad, one which has let the roster brandish through the course of their five-game winning run. Though Fajardo still normed his usual stats against the Elite with 25 points, eight rebounds, and two blocks in the game, what was more impressive was his season-high five assists as he admits putting a more conscious effort in finding his open teammates on the floor. ADVERTISEMENT “Nagdo-double yung tao ni Arwind (Santos) or yung tao ni Alex (Cabagnot) sa akin so nababakante sila (Arwind and Alex’s man has been doubling me so they are getting the open looks),” he said. However, Fajardo said the team is still far from the peak form it covets. “Kailangan pa naming ayusin yung sa depensa namin, kasi may mga time na kailangan namin mag-switch, pero yung communication namin hindi ganun ka-ayos,” he said. (We still have to improve on our defense because there are times were we have to switch but we’re not communicating well.) But the Beermen have been nothing but dominant this conference, as evidenced by their 6-1 record, a league-best. With his team clicking, Fajardo could only share his elation with the way San Miguel has been playing as it gives his teammates more chances to play while also lessening the pressure of a wear and tear on him and the whole team. “Basta kailangan lang maging healthy kami lahat. Tapos kailangan lang naming sundin yung sistema ni coach, yung pina-practice namin kailangan i-apply sa game,” he said. (We have to all be healthy. We have to follow coach’s system, and the things we practice, we have to apply to the games.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T13:43:12.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
