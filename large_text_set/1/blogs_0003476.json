To a Christian, their god willed this loss, and to Christians like Ken Ham, those deaths were a punishment for “sin”. \nMyers is right. Ham’s ridiculous remarks do reveal the odious and profoundly perverse nature of Christianity. The idea that the cause of every death is sin is simply repulsive, repugnant, and revolting. \nBottom line: Ham is a clown and a charlatan. However, he is a dangerous clown, a dangerous charlatan, because he seeks to indoctrinate the young and feeble minded with his toxic, ignorant, and profoundly perverse religious superstitions.
