If nothing is done after this exercise we shall review our stand and go on total strike because an injury to one is an injury to all. It is obvious that the consultant they brought to do the personnel audit did not do a good job.” \nUshie insisted the labour was not against personnel audit, but wanted the job of the consultant to end at screening and not payment of salaries. \nThe TUC Chairman, Clarkson Out, corroborated Ushie’s claim. \nEfforts to reach the Commissioners for Local Government Affairs and Finance, John Ulafo, and Mr. Asuquo Ekpeyong Jnr respectively were unsuccessful as they were not answering their calls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T08:10:06.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
