Considering most of those are deep-fried, dripping with sauce, and slathered in a creamy dip, wings don’t exactly get health food status. \n“The average wing has 35 to 40 calories. Fry it, and they’re 100 calories each,” says Jim White, R.D., owner of Jim White Fitness and Nutrition Studios in Virginia Beach. In fact, one large order of restaurant wings can run you 1,500 calories or more and soar upwards of 80 grams of fat before you even see the blue cheese dressing. \nBut that doesn’t mean you’re stuck eating the sad celery and carrots off the plate. Whip up wings at home so you can trade the fried stuff for grilled, baked, and even steamed wings, says White. (Better yet, get in a great calorie-blasting workout before the game, like one of the eight metabolic routines in the MetaShred Extreme DVD from Men’s Health .) \nOh, and the right serving size for guys isn’t all-you-can-eat—it’s four wings, he says. Fill the rest of your plate with some veggies and you’ve got a well-rounded meal. Waking up on Monday won’t be as painful. \nWith all that in mind, we rounded up 10 better-for-you and definitely not fried wing recipes to help you do your part in that 1.33 billion: 1/10 Fed + Fit Crispy Baked Buffalo Wings \nThis recipe from Fed + Fit will help you realize that wings don’t have to be fried to have that nice crunch when you bite into them.
