Instead, Shaver said he wanted to explore the emotions that officers go through - regardless of the circumstances of the shooting. \n\"It can play on an officer's mind,\" he said. \nOfficer Jonathan Hirdes with the New Orleans Police Department is featured in the documentary. He fatally shot a man during a shoplifting incident in 2014 and was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. \nHe regularly met with counselors in the weeks following the shooting. In the film, Hirdes said it took him five weeks until he finally had a good night's sleep. \n\"That five weeks, I was on the front page of the paper the entire time. They kept it rolling. They kept talking about it,\" Hirdes said. \nShaver said some of the officers were conscience-stricken after taking a life - even when justified - while others said they were concerned because that wasn't their reaction. \n\"Some officers told us, 'I feel guilty because I didn't feel guilty,'\" Shaver said. \"Part of it is just how the individual officer processes the situation.\" \nShaver has a Bachelor's Degree in sociology and a graduate degree in conflict management. Even with a background that combines both law enforcement and academia, he had to research the subject. \n\"I read everything I could get my hands on about officer-involved shootings. I read a lot about (post traumatic stress disorder,)\" he said. \"I had to learn the language before I could even begin to formulate what we wanted to show with the documentary.\" \nPolice officers in a fatal shooting are most often subjects of both criminal and procedural investigations. When they return to duty - if cleared in the shooting - the situation can be tense, even when among other law enforcement officers. \n\"The coworkers may not know how to speak with him. Some coworkers have welcomed them back saying, 'Hey killer, what's going on?'\" Shaver said. \"There's going to be a different dynamic.\" \nShaver said his own background obviously helped gain the trust of the officers interviewed in the film. \n\"They are very particular when it comes to who they talk to and who they open up to,\" he said. \nInterviews were conducted with officers from police departments of all sizes. \"We've spoken with some people who were the first ones to be involved in a shooting in more than a decade,\" Shaver said. \nIn the end, Shaver - a completely self-taught filmmaker temporarily on leave from his department - had accumulated hundreds of hours of interviews with police officers. It was eventually edited down to just over 90 minutes. \n\"It's nothing short of miraculous that this project came together the way it did,\" Shaver said. \nTickets for Friday's screening are $15 at the door or $12 if purchased through the project's website www.OfficerInvolvedProject.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:55:29.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
