The Auburn coach enters his fifth season with a lot of questions about his future. The coach made changes in 2016 to try to shake cobwebs off his hurry-up, no-huddle offense and handed the play-calling reins to Rhett Lashlee . The Tigers won six straight games, but injuries bit the Tigers’ quarterbacks and running backs during the final stretch of the season. Lashlee left Auburn to call his own plays outside of Malzahn’s shadow at UConn, and the Auburn coach turned to a familiar name to join him to rectify what went wrong: Arizona State offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey . Malzahn doesn’t plan to revert to old ideals, however. “My old offensive clipboard, I’m retiring it,” Malzahn said enthusiastically as he introduced Lindsey to the media. “… Yeah, I’m not going to carry that anymore. I retired it officially so that kind of tells you where I’m at, how much confidence I have in this guy right here.” Auburn’s offensive successes and failures have befuddled some and frustrated many Auburn fans over the last two seasons. The Tigers have seemed nearly unstoppable against the bottom half of the SEC, but clams up against the conference’s elite. Three years removed from becoming the first SEC team in history to lead the nation in rushing, the Tigers finished No. 6 nationally in 2016, and yet they couldn’t score more than two touchdowns in each of its last four games against Power 5 teams. The common problem throughout the years: Auburn’s lukewarm passing attack. The Tigers finished 111th and 112th in the last two seasons, while Lindsey’s attacks finished 12th and 39th. “We need to throw the ball more effectively,” Malzahn said. “Chip will bring that. I’m excited about our passing game. He will bring some new ideas, some new wrinkles, new flairs. He’s got a great offensive mind. I think it will complement our run game.” Lindsey’s previous offenses resembled the Hal Mumme and Mike Leach ’s Air Raid more than Malzahn’s power-run attack with play-action passes out of the Shotgun and Pistol. His pass-heavy offenses won state and regional titles on the high school level in Georgia and Alabama. One season as an offensive analyst at Auburn in 2013, when the Tigers led the nation in rushing and advanced to the BCS title game, changed his approach. “When I got here, to be honest with you, it took a lot of learning for me to learn what [Malzahn] did,” Lindsey said. “And I think we did a nice job in the last two places I’ve been of kind of meshing some things together. That’s what we plan on doing here. Obviously, Auburn has been good on offense before and done some things that are really good. We’re not going to lose touch with those things. But I think a few new wrinkles and a little different personality on it maybe will lead to a lot of success.” Lindsey combined his offense with Malzahn’s attack and created a hybrid as Southern Miss’ offensive coordinator in 2014 and 2015. He went on to break five major records with the Golden Eagles and became only the second team in FBS history to have a 4,000-yard passer, 1000-yard receiver and two 1,000-yard rushers in the same season — and they did so after the Golden Eagles were a combined 4-20 in 2013 and 2014. Injuries ravaged Arizona State’s offense in 2016 as eight different players attempted passes and the Sun Devils relied on four quarterbacks, but the Sun Devils still managed a top-40 passing attack. “At the end of the day we want to be a run, play-action team,” Lindsey said. “That’s what we’ve always done. If you go back to our time at Southern Miss and last year at Arizona State that has been our goal. I think when you commit to that style of offense, trying to get the ball to your playmakers, I think good things are going to happen.” Lindsey said he wasn’t familiar with Auburn’s personnel , but has heard good things about the Tigers’ eight returning starters and the opportunity of working with five-star transfer quarterback Jarrett Stidham . “I’m excited about what we have coming back for sure,” he said. Malzahn filled him in on the future. A twinkle of control returned to Malzahn’s eyes. “I told him we're in great shape offensively with talent,” Malzahn said. “I'm kind of jealous, really.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T17:23:59.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
