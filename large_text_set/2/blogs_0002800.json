Since its inception in 1986, the race has only been completed 17 times, by 14 competitors. It’s a torturous 100-mile trek that chews up and spits out the best of the best. 2 \nThe inspiration for the grueling trek’s creator, Gary Cantrell (pictured above), came from reading about James Earl Ray’s run from the law after assassinating Martin Luther King Jr. Ray ran 8 miles through the woods in 55 hours. Cantrell thought to himself, “I could do at least 100 miles in that time.” Thus the tenth ring of hell, The Barkley Marathons, was born. 3 \nTo enter the race, you must submit an essay on why you should be allowed to enter. If you’re one of the “lucky” few, only 40 runners compete at once, you will receive a letter of condolences as an acceptance letter. 4 \nSince its inception in 1986, the course has changed many times, with the current model being a 20-mile unmarked loop. There are no aid stations and you only have access to water at two points along the route, as well as your personal parked car at the starting line. 5 \nTo finish the masochistic marathon, you must complete the loop five times, in under 12 hours per loop, with the second and fourth loops being run in total darkness. You’ll climb 54,200 feet in total and hate yourself the entire way.

You’ll get a new race number after each lap, if you don’t get lost and eaten along the way. 7 Michael Hodge/Flickr \nThe start time for the race also changes, varying from noon to midnight. One hour before the race begins, a great conch shell is blown letting the runners know to get prepared. The race will officially begin when the race director lights his cigarette. 8 \nWhen runners inevitably drop from the race like flies, a bugler signals their failure by playing “Taps”. The bugler is probably the busiest person among race officials. 9 Jun/Flickr \nThe current record of 52 hours, 3 minutes and 8 seconds was set in 2012 by Brett Maune, who has actually completed the race twice.. I don’t know about you, but if I am gonna hate myself for something, it’s going to be all the pizza and beer I ingest, not murdering my body running a trail for some whimsical mastermind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:12:13.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
