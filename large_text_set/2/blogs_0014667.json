Now, information regarding the possible name of the chipset has surfaced the Internet. According to the information available on the LinkedIn profile of an intern at Samsung’s Bangalore R&D Institute, the next Exynos processor could be named Exynos 9810. \nAccording to a speculation by industry insiders, there could be two variants of the Exynos 9810 chipset: Exynos 9810V and Exynos 9810M. The Exynos 9810V could feature an eighteen-core Mali-G71 GPU while the Exynos 9810M could feature a 20-core Mali-G71 GPU. The next Exynos chipset is said to feature Mongoose M2 CPU cores, an upgrade from last year’s Exynos M1 CPU cores. \nSimilar to the Snapdragon 835, the Exynos 9 series chipset is said to be built using Samsung’s 10nm FinFET technology. However, it remains to be seen how it would compete with the Snapdragon 835 SoC from Qualcomm, the upcoming Kirin 970 chipset from Huawei, and the Apple A10 Fusion chipset in terms of raw performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:54:21.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
