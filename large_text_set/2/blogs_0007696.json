Called the Toyota Hilux 2.4G Limited Edition, it appears to be the 2.4G variant dressed up in a more rugged outfit. \nA white truck is shown on both the website’s main page banner and the Hilux page, so we assume that the limited edition pick-up is only available in that hue, which serves as perfect contrast for the black bits. The LE’s hood stripes and full roof sticker are in black, along with the wing mirror covers and rear lamp covers. There’s also a ‘Limited’ emblem on the tailgate. \nIt’s hard to spot chrome on this LE, and the other darkened parts include the front grille, foglamp cover, headlamp cover and hood garnish. The wheels are in dark grey, and the substantially more macho appearance is enhanced further by over-fenders and a front bumper underguard. No mention of interior changes or add-ons. \nClick to enlarge \nThe banner also mentions “limited time, limited stocks” and an on-the-road with insurance price of “from only RM126,000”. The standard Hilux 2.4G AT 4×4 is priced at RM121,900, so the premium charged here is RM4,100. \nPaired to a six-speed auto, the 2.4 litre engine makes 150 hp at 3,400 rpm and 400 Nm of torque from 1,600 and 2,000 rpm. The regular 2.4G AT comes with keyless entry and push start, a 6.1-inch touchscreen head unit, eight-way powered driver’s seat, leather, three airbags, VSC and window tint, among other things. \nGALLERY: Toyota Hilux 2.4G AT 4×4 Research Toyota Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:57:06.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
