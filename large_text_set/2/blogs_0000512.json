But there's a third, perhaps more important figure out there with the 27-year-old, offering advice and encouragement as Muller hones his finishing skills: Hermann Gerland. \nBayern Munich's assistant coach, 62, was Muller's mentor when the Germany international was a still-budding teenager in the second team, and also the man who first recognised the gangly forward's true potential. Gerland pleaded with the then-sporting director Uli Hoeness to turn down a â‚¬3 million offer for the 19-year-old from TSG Hoffenheim 1899 in 2009. \n\"Uli, this guy scores goals,\" Gerland predicted. He'd soon be proven right. \nEight years and 156 goals for the first team later, however, Muller is going through an unprecedented lean spell that has the whole of German football worried. Four goals in 24 games in all competitions for Bayern in 2016-17 constitutes his poorest return as a professional yet. \nSo what's going on? \nWhen Muller finally comes in from the icy cold to sit down with ESPN FC, there's little hint of a frustrated player at odds with himself. He's relaxed as usual, joking with the camera crew and poking fun at his interlocutor's messy handwriting: \"I couldn't read that,\" he smiles. Nevertheless, Muller admits that there's a degree of discontent in relation to the unconvincing team performances, despite the club topping the table after eight wins in a row and still being involved in all three main competitions. Thomas Muller has struggled since last summer's Euros, but he feels confident of turning around his fortunes. \n\"That's Bayern Munich for you,\" he shrugs. Maybe they're precisely top because of that perfectionist attitude, he adds. \"We are not satisfied if we win in a game that doesn't feel like it was our game. We won the last three away games narrowly. They were tough games. You can search for reasons. Maybe it was the pitches. Right now, the weather isn't that good. But that's only a small part. We don't play the style we want to play. The ball isn't [moving around] the way want to. We have a good mentality and very good players. But we want more. More control.\" \nSome of his teammates have explained the club's stuttering campaign, in terms of football played if not the results achieved, as a consequence of the players and Carlo Ancelotti still getting used to each other. But Muller disagrees. \n\"I don't think that's the problem,\" he says. \"Everybody needs to look at the mirror and think why it doesn't work that well. I think it's more of a problem of the team than of individuals. We as players have to find the solution to be a team, to be more compact on the pitch. The distances between us are too big, we have problems with the second ball. Against Freiburg and Bremen, we had so much defending to do that we didn't create many chances.\" \nMuller looked particularly out of sorts in those two nervy away wins. It was far from the fresh start he had vowed to make in very upbeat interviews during the winter break, rather more of the same old, enigmatic, poor run that's followed his goalless outing at Euro 2016. He readily acknowledges that he has \"few arguments\" in his favour at the moment, \"my (goal-scoring) stats are not the same as in recent years\". But he does offer some context. \n\"When the team's not playing well offensively, it's always a problem for me because I'm not an individualistic player,\" Muller says. \"I don't take the ball in the middle of the pitch and dribble past six guys. When our positioning and ball game and passing is not that good, then my game is struggling as well. I can score from set pieces and so on but I have to be involved in the combinations, make my runs without the ball, go deep. When we find our game, play more balls on the ground, through the middle, and combine better, it's more comfortable for me as well.\" \nHe's hopeful that a return to the Allianz Arena after two games on bumpy pitches will see an immediate improvement, and adds that the pressure he exerts on himself to succeed was \"more objective\" than that of the media, who will often use one particular stat in isolation to prove a point. \"If I only looked at my running, I should have scored 35 goals by now, because I'm running more than last year,\" he explains. Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller speaks to Raphael Honigstein about his recent dip in form. \nThe raw data aside, there's a view in Germany that Muller, a forward blessed with an instinctive feel for being in the right place at the right time, might be over-thinking things right now. He shakes his head. \"I don't think I think too much. I try to work hard, maybe a little harder than during spells when everything [feels easy]. I'm not negative. I try to think about the next chance, the next game, the next opportunity to play well. I try to have fun, I try to support my teammates and I think about the game [itself], why I'm not in the right position at the right moment. But I can't influence everything on the pitch that would help me. I can't think about the other guys. I try to focus on my game, and on the things that are important for the team. For myself, it would be nice to score a little more.\" \nNot just for himself. In the absence of his goals, Bayern have been forced to rely on moments of individual brilliance by Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben. It's a risky ploy, especially against better opposition in the Champions League. \"We have to improve,\" Muller says. \"It's not enough to believe that we will somehow find a way.\" Especially not against the familiar foe that comes in the shape of Arsenal, their opponents in the round of 16 in the Champions League. Bayern have always prevailed in knockout games against Arsene Wenger's men. But the perfect record hides some very close shaves. \n\"They're in good shape, they have very good players and and a very good manager,\" Muller says. \"They are feeling comfortable but over the last few years, we have also felt comfortable -- after the games against Arsenal. I hope it'll be the same. It's always tough [against them] though.\" Muller recalls 15 very difficult opening minutes in the first leg of the last-16 tie three years ago, when Bayern were \"under real pressure\" until a penalty miss from Mesut Ozil changed the momentum. The Germans eventually won 2-0 at the Emirates. \n\"We also lost 2-0 at home against them (in 2013) after winning 3-1 in London. We were very close to getting knocked out then,\" Muller recalls. \"Against these top teams, anything can happen. And usually, you see good football, not so much defending and destruction. Both teams want the ball, both want to play football.\" \nMuller has been on the score sheet four times in six games against the Gunners, so there's cause for optimism. Could his and his team's season will follow a different path this year compared to three campaigns under Pep Guardiola that saw Bayern regularly peak before Christmas and fall away ever so slightly during the second half of the season? \"Maybe it will work out that way, we don't know,\" Muller says. \"But Carlo Ancelotti is Mr. Champions League. So the Bayern Munich crowd are very hopeful that it will be a special season.\" \nIf the Italian is to live up to that moniker, however, Muller must also remember his own nickname. The Bavarians need the self-appointed \" Raumdeuter \", the space interpreter, to find his path to goals again. \nRaphael Honigstein is ESPN FC's German football expert.
