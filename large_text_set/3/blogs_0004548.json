However, in a fresh report, TechCrunch reports that while LeEco has reduced its headcount in India, it has denied plans of exiting the country. \nAs per the report, LeEco has reduced its workforce in India from over to 350 employees to a total of 80. A LeEco spokesperson revealed to the publication that the company’s size of the team is now “in line with industry benchmarks ,” putting its India staff numbers on a comparable level with those of rival Chinese brands like Xiaomi and OnePlus. Two senior management executives from LeEco have reportedly designed, including COO of Smart Electronics Business Atul Jain and COO of Internet Applications Debashish Ghosh. \nIt’s worth mentioning that LeEco recently exited the offline market in India, and slowed down new product launches in the country. Also, the company’s chairman confirmed last year that the brand is facing a cash crunch. However, the company doesn’t seem to be losing hope as far the Indian market is concerned, at least for now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T14:52:17.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
