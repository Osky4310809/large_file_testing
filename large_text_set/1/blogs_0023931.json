One notable objector was Tesla CEO Elon Musk , who tweeted the ban is \"not the best way to address the country's challenges.\" And Musk won't just be tweeting, but said he will gather recommended modifications to the executive order that he plans to present to Trump .\n\nhttps://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502618680045568\nPeople from the predominantly Muslim countries of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Yemen, Somalia, and Libya will temporarily be barred from entering America, according to Trump's executive order, which reads \"I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order.\" Trump claimed the order was not about religion, but about terrorism. \nRelated: Artist covers two houses in bright pink crochet as a symbol of hope for refugees \n\nSilicon Valley leaders were quick to stand against Trump's executive order. Google co-founder Sergey Brin joined a protest at the San Francisco International Airport, telling one reporter he was a refugee, Airbnb promised to provide housing for stranded refugees, and Elon Musk tweeted , \"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825809205244223488\nMusk provided a link to the text of the executive order on the Wall Street Journal so people can read it for themselves. He said he will \"seek advisory council consensus & present to President.\"\nBorn in South Africa , Musk came to the United States in 1992 to attend the University of Pennsylvania. He sits on an economic advisory board for Trump and more recently agreed to be part of a Manufacturing Jobs Initiative started by the president. Let's hope Trump is willing to listen to his recommendations. \nVia The Verge ( 1 , 2 , 3 )\nImages via OnInnovation on Flickr and Lorie Shaull on Flickr \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T17:05:36.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
