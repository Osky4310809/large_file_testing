Initially, reporter Campbell wrote, “The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office says 2 people were transported to the hospital after crash at Volusia County Speedway.” \nWESH.com reported that at least one person was seriously injured. The Volusia Speedway is located in Barberville, Florida. “The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office told WESH 2 News that a race car went into the stands around 9:24 p.m.,” the TV station reported. \nThe video shows the car lose control and then flip into the spectator stands. \n“The car’s upside down flipping wildly in turn two,” the announcer says in the above video. \nPeople on Twitter prayed for those who were injured and expressed concern. Here are some of the reactions to the crash on social media. @jonesbrent570 If it helps, word's out that they're restarting the race at Volusia. Could be a good sign. \n— Joseph Shelton (@JosephSheltonSM) February 20, 2017 Sending positive thoughts to those injured in the crowd at Volusia Speedway. Very scary. \n— Jason Kasper (@JasonKasper1994) February 20, 2017 This should have never happened … A CHAIN LINK FENCE REALLY this has nothing to do with the racing this one is on the track #Volusia \n— Racing And Gaming (@IndycarPs4) February 20, 2017 \nThis post will be updated as more becomes known about the tragedy.
