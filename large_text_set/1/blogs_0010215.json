Conway repeatedly insisted to Cooper that CNN’s “screaming headline” was wrong and that they linked to the BuzzFeed report online. \nWhile the interview was going on, Jim Sciutto tweeted this: in fact, @KellyannePolls , this links to @DylanByers story on the controversy: https://t.co/NufJL9qfHA Not to buzzfeed story on dossier https://t.co/W4d5SFRowW \n— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) January 12, 2017 Fact @KellyannePolls you said repeatedly on our air we LINKED to the buzzfeed story, which we did not, not that a story mentioned its name https://t.co/Q0JrqsiUwN \n— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) January 12, 2017 \nCooper seemed utterly bewildered at Conway scolding CNN for its report, and when she said “I know CNN is feeling the heat today,” Cooper shot back, “I think you guys are feeling the heat.” \nCooper defended CNN’s reporting and asked Conway how she can dismiss it as inaccurate when she doesn’t know for certain that it’s false. He said, “CNN is not BuzzFeed, I just wish you guys would acknowledge [it].” \nAt one point Conway told him that “CNN and BuzzFeed have a lot in common” and criticized both for not seeing Trump’s win coming. Cooper shot back, “You can’t stick to what we’re talking about now.” \nConway even told Cooper that she doesn’t expect CNN to hold anyone accountable if it turns out the story is wrong, with her saying they have “no evidence of it other than unnamed sources.” \nCooper pointed to other outlets that have backed up CNN’s reporting and said it’s “unfair and frankly disingenuous” to lump in CNN’s report with BuzzFeed’s. \nHe pointed to how Fox’s Shep Smith stood up for CNN. Conway asked if anyone else at Fox did and Cooper said, “I haven’t talked to Sean Hannity today, I’m sure you guys have a couple times.” \nWatch the full interview above, via CNN. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T04:32:19.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
