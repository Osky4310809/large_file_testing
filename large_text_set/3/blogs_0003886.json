Governor Rotimi Akeredolu \nLeaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC and other stakeholders are said to have picked holes in those pencilled down for appointment by the governor. \nThe governor, who was said to have promised a former House of Representatives, Ifedayo Abegunde, the position of the Secretary to the State Government, SSG, is having a rethink. \nBut Abegunde’s backer who worked assiduously for Akeredolu’s emergence as governor is not giving up and was said to have insisted on the former National Assembly member clinching the post. \nOthers under consideration for the position of the SSG include Kole Oluwajana,Tunji Light Ariyomo and Niyi Adegbomire SAN. \nParty members waiting for the pronouncement by yesterday, were disappointed when they heard that the governor had travelled to Abuja to attend the NEC meeting of the party ahead of its convention. \nAkeredolu will be attending the meeting of the governors of the party today for the first time. \nHe is expected back in the state according to sources by the weekend. \nIn another development the Inter-Party Advisory Council, IPAC, in the state has been engulfed in major crisis following the removal of Hon Fatai Adams, the Deputy Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, as the chairman of the body. \nThe amalgamation of political parties after their meeting in Akure said the removal of Adams as the Chairman was as a result of the crisis in the PDP which has factionalized it.
