Marshall first took to Facebook on Tuesday to lament how the new security protocols at the Capitol, which include metal detectors and X-ray machines, were not how visitors should be treated when entering the \"People's House.\"\n\nFirearms are prohibited inside the building, except for elected officials and legislative staff with valid conceal-carry permits, per state law .\nRead More â†’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T01:29:36.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
