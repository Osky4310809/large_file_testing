This time it was Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, who stepped up. \nAs HuffPost UK revealed earlier this week , the anti-EU party has a semi-permanent residency on the show. \nUkip appeared on almost one in four of the flagship programmes in the past seven years - despite never having more than two MPs. \nOur analysis of the 258 regular Question Time shows since May 6 2010 showed the party had a representative on 24% of the programmes. But something was different this week. \nLast week, its sole MP, Douglas Carswell, resigned from the party, meaning it no longer has a voice in the House of Commons. Ex-leader Nigel Farage has stood unsuccessfully for election to the Commons seven times, in five general elections and two by-elections. Nuttall’s most recent attempt in Stoke also failed. So no MPs? But a seat on the Question Time panel? Amazing that regardless how badly they do UKIP still have their safe seat on #bbcqt programme. — Angus B MacNeil MP (@AngusMacNeilSNP) March 30, 2017 Missed #bbcqt but hoping someone asked why the only seat that UKIP can keep hold of these days is on the @bbcquestiontime panel?! — David Lammy (@DavidLammy) March 30, 2017 That was two MPs who couldn’t resist during the joke. But the gag was rolled out well in advance. The only 'safe seat' UKIP has in politics is on BBC Question Time. This week Paul Nuttall will be appearing. #BBCQT @bbcquestiontime pic.twitter.com/uxq8Q0hNg2 — Scott Nelson (@SocialistVoice) March 30, 2017 #Ukip struggle to get a seat in the House of Commons but they don't have such an issue getting a seat on #bbcqt Hmmm! #Article50 #Remain https://t.co/eDP2o3EJRV", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:58:39.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
