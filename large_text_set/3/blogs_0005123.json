Lascañas said President Rodrigo Duterte, when he was a city mayor, ordered and paid him and other members of a so-called liquidation squad to kill criminals and opponents, including a kidnapping suspect and his entire family and a critical radio commentator. AP/Bullit Marquez \nMANILA, Philippines — Self-confessed hitman Arthur Lascañas on Monday claimed that the so-called Davao Death Squad (DDS) was used as \"foot soldiers\" of drug lords. \nDuring the Senate public order committee inquiry, Lascañas recounted his experience as an alleged DDS member. \nLascañas narrated one of their investigation involving Taiwanese nationals which resulted in \"collateral damage.\" \nLIVE: Death squad 'leader' faces Senate panel \nAfter the operation, then Superintendent Ronald \"Bato\" Dela Rosa purportedly called Lascañas and asked about their findings on the Taiwanese nationals. \n\"Sabi ko sa kanya wala kami nakuhang drugs... Pagkakaalam namin nag-settle siya ng problem with Charlie Tan kaya lang may dalawang collateral damage,\" Lascañas told the Senate panel.   \nDela Rosa then told Lascañas that the operation was a supposed \"elimination of competitors.\" \nThe Taiwanese were supposedly the rival of Tan, who is also a drug lord. \n\"Ang sa isip-isip ko hindi pala lingid sa kaalaman namin nagiging mga foot soldiers kami ng mga drug lord,\" Lascañas said. \nLascañas also recounted the last operation that he was involved with the so-called DDS, which occurred in 2015. \nLast month, Lascañas resurfaced and retracted his denial of the existence of the DDS during previous Senate hearings in October last year. \nThe self-confessed hitman said that he was forced to deny everything. \nAsked about why he suddenly changed his testimony, Lascañas said that he wants to clear his conscience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T07:09:51.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
