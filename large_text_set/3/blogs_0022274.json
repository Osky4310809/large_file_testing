I was instantly hand cuffed before being asked to identify myself and before being told why. In the process I said my name and told them they have wrong person. They proceeded to ignore me and I was treated like a criminal. I am sure no father wants his sons or daughters to see him in Handcuffs especially if he is innocent. As some one who has law enforcers in my family, I was appalled by the bahavior of the LAPD.” \nIn one video, Wyclef identified himself as a recording artist and later threatened “to sue the LAPD.” \n“I’m coming from the studio with T-Baby,” Wyclef said. “And y’all see the police have handcuffs on me. They just took off my Haitian bandana. That’s what’s going on right now with Wyclef.” A post shared by Wyclef Jean (@wyclefjean) on Mar 21, 2017 at 4:52am PDT A post shared by Wyclef Jean (@wyclefjean) on Mar 21, 2017 at 6:23am PDT \nAs for why he was pulled over by L.A. County Sheriff’s deputies, TMZ reports that Wyclef matched the identity of an armed robbery suspect. His car matched the description of the vehicle used in the armed robbery, and both Wyclef and the suspect wore bandanas. \nAlthough ‘Clef stated that he was “instantly” handcuffed, TMZ reports being told that “Wyclef reached toward his waistband” while talking to authorities. \nWyclef was ultimately let go and the robbery suspect was caught around the same time.
