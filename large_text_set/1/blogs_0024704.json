They often look for specific personality traits and psychological profiles before trusting a person with their wealth.\nSpecialist firms carry out the checks and Business Insider spoke to one of them – Corporate Resolutions – to find out what triggers the biggest and brightest red flags. The company, based in New York, was set up by a former FBI agent.\n\"We cruise social networking sites to ensure the potential executive or money-manager is not commenting on or posting pictures,\" that potential employers would find distasteful, Joelle Scott, a senior vice president at Corporate Resolutions, said.\nSites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram offer a huge repository of public information about private people. Here's what companies like Corporate Resolutions look at.\nView As: One Page Slides 1: Drug use – \"You’d be shocked to know how many executives flaunt illegal behavior on social networks,\" said Scott. Reuters/ DEA One of the UK's most high-profile bank scandals involved former Co-operative Bank CEO Paul Flowers being secretly filmed handing over £300 in cash for drugs such as crystal meth and ketamine in 2013 . \n2: Salaciousness – \"It may not be 'illegal,' but some types of behaviour are embarrassing, and employers don’t want any part of it,\" Scott said. canhasal/Flickr Big banks may see salacious behaviour as a risk factor. L ast year, the transcripts of text messages between a former Goldman Sachs salesmen and an alleged prostitute known as \"Michella\" were released in a court case between the Libyan Investment Authority and the US bank. \n3: Threatening or harassing statements about friends, co-workers, celebrities or political figures – \"People forget that using Facebook or Twitter to express extreme opinions about a politician puts a potential employer in a very uncomfortable position. Often, they’ll move on and look at other qualified candidates,\" said Scott. Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images The last thing a bank needs is a loose cannon. \n4: Encouraging or supporting hate groups or terrorists – \"Twitter is known to have a strong racist/white supremacist following. Being associated with such a group is Kryptonite for employers,\" Scott said. AP Photo Finance firms want to be seen as inclusive employers, focused on talent rather than background, so anyone with extreme views will have trouble fitting in.\n5: Cheating/being unethical – \"Bragging about cheating at poker, or worse, cheating on your husband or wife? Yeah, employers are not going to look on that favourably,\" said Scott.
