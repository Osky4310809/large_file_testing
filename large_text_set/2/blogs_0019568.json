It’s unpredictable to say the least.”\nThe 25-year-old wrote that she plans to retire in June in order to go get her master’s. Reddit Her usual clientele consists of businessmen age 40 and over, and she usually has the most fun with “fat men.”\n“Most white-collar type professions, more Caucasian, Indian and Asian than other races, and mostly in the 40-60 age group,” she says.\n“I’m happy with this, because these guys are well mannered and really generous.”\nShe also claims to have had sex with more than 1,100 men — and the oldest client she ever had was a Holocaust survivor.\nShe revealed she is not a “knock-out model” but channels the “girl-next-door type of look.”\nFamous clients have included “NRL [National Rugby League] and union players” — although she has kept specific names under wraps.\nShe also states she’s open to many bizarre fantasies but will not do incest role play, water or mud sports or long bookings out of the city.\nHer mother, best friends and ex-boyfriends know about her job as an escort — but she is afraid of her father and brothers finding out.\n“I broke down and confessed everything to my parents about having been a sex worker for years about 2 years ago while I was on hiatus,” she wrote.\n“Only my mum knows I’ve returned. She doesn’t want me to tell [my dad] because otherwise she’d ‘never hear the end of it.’\n“But I think deep down he knows.”\nShe plans to “retire in June” when she is set to move overseas and study for a master’s degree.\n This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": ["http://nyp.st/2lz0MX6", "http://www.thesun.co.uk/", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/capture3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&strip=all", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2901729/escort-25-who-charges-340-an-hour-and-has-bedded-over-1000-men-reveals-all-in-very-candid-reddit-thread/", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/capture3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/capture3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=600", "https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/5uvdkf/ama_i_am_a_sex_worker_escort_in_sydney/", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/capture3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=150", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/capture3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&strip=all"], "published": "2017-02-20T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:41:01.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
