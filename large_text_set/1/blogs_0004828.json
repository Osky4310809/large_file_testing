A couple of years ago it would have been like a dream just to meet Pacquiao but now to get a chance to take his world title is amazing. Things have certainly moved quickly for me in the last couple of days,” said Horn. \nThe undefeated Australian (16-0, with 11 KOs) said he can do better against Pacquiao than Vargas, who lost to the Filipino icon in a lopsided fight last November in Las Vegas.   \n“I watched Pacquiao's fight with Vargas and I thought Pacquiao easily outboxed him. Vargas is a very basic fighter. He's tough but he doesn't do anything special,” Horn explained. \n“He just stands right in front of you with a long jab and a right hand. If I was fighting Pacquiao I would move a lot more than Vargas did and give Pacquiao different angles the same way he did to Vargas,” he added.
