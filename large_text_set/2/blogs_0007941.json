Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDavid Beckham made the most of being in New York by enjoying a day out with the kids as wife Victoria headed to the office. \nThe Spice Girl turned fashion designer is hard at work for New York Fashion Week and the rest of the Beckhams wrapped up warm to head out in the snow-hit city. \nThe famous family are getting on with life as normal amid the hacked email scandal which put their brand at risk. \nDavid looked the doting dad as he walked down the street holding Harper's hand.

Read More What fun things did they get up to? (Photo: Rex Features) It was a business trip for Victoria (Photo: Splash News) \nThe designer looked super stylish in a pair or black wide-leg trousers and a khaki green polo neck jumper, with the sleeves rolled up to just below her elbows. \nShe completed her look with a designer bag tucked under her left arm and hid her eyes behind a pair of large sunglasses. \nShe was only walking from the front door of the hotel to a waiting car, but still, she must have felt the cold after she chose not to wear a coat. \nIt's been a tough time for the Beckhams lately, after emails of the footballing ace allegedly moaning about not being handed a knighthood were hacked and leaked.

(Photo: Splash News) \nIn one, Becks allegedly branded the honours committee “unappreciative c***s” after he missed out on a knighthood. \nIn another, referring to the 2014 New Year Honours OBE for opera star Katherine Jenkins, who had confessed to taking drugs in the past, Becks allegedly said: “For what? Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F***ing joke.” \nThe hacker who blackmailed David's team by threatening to release the emails is not on the run and fears for his life. \nThe cyber criminal has already upset African despots and Russian, Turkish and Kazakh mafias. \nHis life is a continuous game of cat-and-mouse in which he must always stay one step ahead of his ruthless enemies.
