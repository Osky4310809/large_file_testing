No matter how nourishing the formula, mattes tend to suck every last drop of moisture out of my lips, leaving them scaly and cracked. And, because I'm incredibly stubborn, I haven't stopped wearing matte textures because I refuse to sacrifice that intense color in favor of something more hydrating (and sheer). \nThough it's been months since I've willingly switched over to a cream formula, Tarte's new Color Splash Lipstick ($21) has me hooked. Just a mere glance at the tube was enough, to be honest: the bullets are housed in a blue marbleized tube reminiscent of a Caribbean shoreline. \nThis launch is part of the brand's \"Rainforest of the Sea\" range, so it contains a smoothing blend of algae and marine flower extracts for an extra burst in hydration. Every single lipstick is intensely creamy and seriously pigmented, and glides on as easily as a balm. Even better, it's pretty durable, meaning you can get through several cups of coffee without needing to reapply. ADVERTISEMENT \nIt's available in 24 shades, consisting primarily of neutrals (in a wide range of tones for varying complexions) with a few punchy pops of color thrown in. I'm particularly fond of Beach Babe, a light pinky beige that reads as the perfect nude for my porcelain skin, as well as Popsicle, a vibrant pink. I'll definitely be tucking a tube into my purse for my next tropical vacation, as it'll look gorgeous surrounded by sand on Instagram. \nThe collection is available now on TarteCosmetics.com , so read on to see which hues you need in your stash, then shop your favorites.
