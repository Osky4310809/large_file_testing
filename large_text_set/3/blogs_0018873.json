The US singer/songwriter has penned huge chart smashes for Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Fifth Harmony and many, many more. Now, she's looking after No. 1. Quite right too, considering there's an incredible voice to match her masterful way around a chorus. Customer Reviews by Beautifulfreak86 I have known Julia (via the internet) for about the last 10 years and she used to send me her singles that she was working on but was too shy to release. I see you can now purchase them and I'm glad! Because she is just brilliant. She has an amazingly unique voice and is a bit of a mysterious soul which only adds to it all! Well done Julia! This is a lush song and I'm supporting you all the way! You deserve the success you are now having!
