Whether you want to set a timer with your voice, play a game of chess with a computer or just put a Minion’s head on Superman’s body , AI can help you achieve your goal. Of course, that same power can be used for things that are not so sweet , like, um, killing us all. Stephen Hawking Says A.I. Could Be Our 'Worst Mistake In History' Stephen Hawking Says A.I.

Sponsored \nWhile the fund is primarily concerned with the more immediate effects of artificial intelligence on society, it’s probably not a bad idea to start thinking about such systems under an ethical framework now. \n“A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble,” cautioned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking during a Reddit AMA last year. “You’re probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you’re in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. Let’s not place humanity in the position of those ants.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T06:25:36.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
