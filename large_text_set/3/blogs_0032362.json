He vowed to remedy the situation, and has documented his weight-loss journey on social media. \nToday, no one can easily tell the difference between Raymond and his hunky twin brother, Richard Gutierrez. Many social media users have given him a warm applause for his efforts to trim down his body. “Every day, I work hard towards my goals. It hasn’t been easy, but every little change I see in my body keeps me motivated. Work in progress,” the TV host captioned his workout video on Instagram . A post shared by Raymond Gutierrez (@mondgutierrez) on Mar 24, 2017 at 11:55pm PDT A post shared by Raymond Gutierrez (@mondgutierrez) on Mar 10, 2017 at 3:47am PST \nLast year, Gutierrez chronicled his workout routine through a series of video blogs on YouTube with the help of his close friends Anne Curtis, Erwan Heussaff, Solenn Heussaff and husband Nico Bolzico, Isabelle Daza and her husband, Adrien Semblat. \n“All these great amazing opportunities fell on my lap but I forgot to take care of my health,” he reflected on his first day of workout. “I had all these excuses in my head that would stop me from working out or eating healthy. In order to motivate myself, I had to motivate others.” \nWhen people started to notice his weight loss, Gutierrez, 33, felt elated and amused about the drastic changes in his physique. “It hasn’t been easy for me, it has been three and a half months of non-stop working out and watching what I eat,” he elaborated. \n“People keep asking me, ‘what’s the secret?’ There’s no secret, guys. You really just have to put in the time, work hard, make the effort and have the discipline. It’s just about committing to it, gaining that momentum and not stopping,” he concluded his video blog.
