Since his arrival at the club in 2013, the Denmark international has gone on to establish himself as one of the most effective attacking midfielders in the Premier League. Speaking to Ekstra Bladet (h/t Sport Witness ) during his time on international duty, the 25-year-old was quizzed on what offer he'd need to receive to leave Spurs. \"I honestly haven't thought about it,\" was his response. Eriksen continued: \"I live in the present. Right now, there are still more than three years left on my contract. I feel great and really like being at Tottenham.\" GLYN KIRK/Getty Images As noted in the report, the Danish media have been talking up a possible move for Eriksen to a club like Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, such are the standards he has been setting this season. But Spurs fans will be delighted he has no intention of going anywhere. Although Harry Kane and Dele Alli hog the spotlight in north London, the former Ajax man knits play together brilliantly. His ability to find a pass, carve out space in compact midfields and glide past opposition defenders with balance has made Eriksen a joy to watch. As noted by the Match of the Day Twitter account, Eriksen has also developed a reputation as being a specialist from long range: Match of the Day @BBCMOTD The long-ranger... Since his PL debut in 2013, Christian Eriksen has scored more goals from outside the box than any other player #MOTD2 https://t.co/3stQrW3vFD 3/19/2017, 11:15:17 PM The Tottenham man will surely be aware that he's making rapid progress under the astute guidance of manager Mauricio Pochettino, too. Indeed, Eriksen is thriving in different positions, is working harder off the ball and is adding a level of consistency to his game. Already this term he has six goals in the top flight, as well as 10 assists; expect the midfielder to be vital as Spurs chase a top-four finish and the FA Cup. Vincent Janssen Discusses Future Ian Walton/Getty Images Tottenham striker Vincent Janssen has said he is frustrated by his first season in English football, although he still feels positive he has a future at the football club. \"Of course, I'm not satisfied with the amount of playing time in recent months,\" he told Voetbal International (h/t James Benge of the Evening Standard ). \"But I remain positive. Moreover, things are going very well at Tottenham Hotspur. I'm not going to walk around as the only player whining. That makes no sense.\" Janssen has only started five games in the Premier League this season and only netted his first goal from open play in any competition in the recent 6-0 FA Cup quarter-final win over Millwall . Janssen netted against Millwall recently. GLYN KIRK/Getty Images The Spurs No. 9 arrived at the club with a big reputation, having shone for AZ Alkmaar in the Eredivisie. Per Jack Pitt-Brooke of The Independent, his contribution has been somewhat limited so far: Jack Pitt-Brooke @JackPittBrooke Maybe Vincent Janssen has found his special skill: winning free-kicks in added time when defending a lead. 3/19/2017, 4:09:18 PM Tottenham do need a player to lend support to Kane up top, although it seems as though Pochettino lacks faith in the Dutchman. Indeed, with their star man sidelined through injury, the Spurs boss has turned to attacking midfielder Heung-Min Son to lead the line. Janssen has endeared himself to Tottenham supporters with his clear desire to succeed at the club, while his performances on the pitch are never lacking in commitment. That should afford the 22-year-old more time as he seeks to show he can cut it in English football's top flight.
