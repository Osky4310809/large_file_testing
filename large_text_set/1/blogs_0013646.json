These claims are contemptible and shocking. Amber Heard will donate the settlement money to charity (Photo: Splash News) \n\"Johnny seems to wish to prolong this proceeding as a means of punishing me.\" \nHowever, a judge threw out Johnny's request on Friday and granted the divorce. \nAmber has vowed to donate her settlement to ACLA and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and previously insisted she was desperate for a \"quick resolution\" because she wants her \"life back\". Johnny Depp (Photo: Getty) \nIn other paperwork Amber has claimed: \"Johnny has not lived up to his obligation to me under the [settlement], including payments, allowing me to retrieve my personal property, transferring title of a vehicle to me and meeting regarding division of the furniture and furnishings in the residential units we occupied. \n\"I have been committed to a quick resolution of this matter so that I can be divorced from [Depp]. Unfortunately, Johnny and his counsel seem to wish to prolong the proceeding as a means of punishing me. \n\"Johnny has delayed the resolution of this matter. I want my life back. I want to be divorced now.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:31:13.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
