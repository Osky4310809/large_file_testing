While traditional logic usedÂ to favor wild-caught, particularly with regard to salmon, many have pointed to the vast improvements in farming standards Â that have made it a more eco-friendly option.\nWATCH:Â Leonardo DiCaprio Would Love to Play Vladimir Putin \nÂ \nDiCaprio has long been an warriorÂ for the environment and climate change, meeting with President Obama in 2016 on the issue and sayingÂ global warming deniers â€œdo not believe in factsâ€ and â€œshould not be allowed to hold public office.â€", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:32:40.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
