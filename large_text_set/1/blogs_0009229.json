We reasoned that this animal would have to resemble an auroch. \n\"We see progress not only in looks and behavior but also in de-domestication of the animals.\" \nIn conjunction with the Rewilding Europe group, the Tauros, bred from a number of current species with auroch ancestry, have been released into areas of Spain, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Romania, where they have had to contend with wolves and other predators. \nMr Goderie believes that by 2025, the seventh generation of neo-aurochs will be as close as possible to the originals. \nIn 2015 a British farmer was forced to kill off half his herd of auroch-derived Heck cattle because they kept trying to kill him. \nThe aggressive breed was produced by German zoologists and brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck, whom the Nazi party commissioned to produce a breed of cattle based on the aurochs, a taller and leaner animal than today's cows. \nDerek Gow said: \"What the Germans did with their breeding programme was create something truly primeval. \n\"When the Germans were selecting them to create this animal they used Spanish fighting cattle to give them the shape and ferocity they wanted.\" \nHe turned the rogue cows into “very tasty” sausages that tasted a bit like venison, he said.
