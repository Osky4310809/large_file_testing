They found that the adults with a lower body mass index ate more dairy.\nHowever, lower blood pressure was associated with eating cheese more than other products like yogurt and milk.\nThey found that while adults who ate large amounts of cheese consumed more saturated fat, they did not have the associated higher cholesterol. \nDr. Emma Feeney, Food for Health Ireland’s program manager, said: “Simply looking at individual foods does not reflect the real story.\n“What will really impact on our metabolic health, is the overall pattern in which whole foods are consumed.”\n  This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:36:14.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
