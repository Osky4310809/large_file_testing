Sex eases stress \nIt’s well known stress can have serious implications. Stress is largely the result of many interacting psychological factors and can vary significantly between people. \nNevertheless, it can cause all kinds of health problems from mild headaches, sleeping difficulties and muscle tension, to more severe issues such as malfunction of the immune system and chronic depression. \nThere is evidence that being close to your partner (physically and emotionally) can lower stress levels. \nPhysical intimacy can trigger the release of all kinds of chemicals in the brain including: dopamine — which plays a major role in reward-motivated behaviour, focuses attention and generally increases motivation, endorphins — our body’s natural pain and stress fighters, and oxytocin — affectionately known as “the cuddle hormone”, which can trigger feelings of compassion. \nAfter an orgasm, the body releases the hormone prolactin, which often leads to drowsiness and a general feeling of relaxation. \nComfort ultimately resulting in sleep is a common post-orgasm response. \nOne study actually found having sex every day for a full fortnight decreased anxiety and led to cell growth in the hippocampus (the emotion centre) of rodents. \nThere’s also evidence suggesting regular sex lowers stress-related blood pressure. Sex boosts self-esteem \nThere’s an old saying “sex is like food; it’s only a big deal when you’re not getting enough of it”. \nWith sex it’s not so much a matter of “the more the better”, but a complete lack of sex can be quite harmful. \nThere is some evidence a lack of sex is associated with feelings of depression and low self-worth. \nIn today’s world there is a lot of social pressure to be sexually active. Having a non-existent or minimal sex life can feel socially stigmatising. \nIn this way, having sex can unburden someone from a strong social pressure and enhance their self-esteem. \nAll of us have fundamental psychological needs we need to fulfil in order to remain mentally healthy. \nHaving sex isn’t (strictly) a fundamental human need, but it’s an important part of love and connection. \nEminent psychologist Abraham Maslow suggested there were five categories of fundamental human needs. \nIn addition to obvious physiological needs such as water, food and sleep, there are four categories of fundamental psychological needs: safety, love/connection, esteem and autonomy. \nOf course we need to meet our physiological needs, but then to be happy, stable people, we need to fulfil each category of psychological need on a regular basis. \nIf too many psychological needs go unmet for too long, our mental health can be negatively affected. \nSome studies suggest that in certain situations, social isolation can be a predictor of early death. Sex enhances intimacy with your partner Regular sex helps couples better connect on an emotional level. (Flickr: Intertia NC) \nSometimes, for whatever reason, couples just don’t have regular sex. \nThis can be the beginning of a vicious cycle: you or your partner don’t feel like having sex, and then eventually you may start to (consciously or not) resent your partner for not having sex, and you gradually grow further and further apart, eventually not even wanting to have sex with your partner. \nAs obvious as it might sound, regular sex with your partner makes a big difference to how you get along with them. \nBeing intimate with your partner on a frequent basis allows you to emotionally connect with them on a much deeper level. Sex makes you smart \nHaving sex changes your brain chemistry in all kinds of ways; and there is evidence sex actually increases your cognitive capacity. \nOne study found even just thinking about a past sexual encounter can enhance your analytic thinking skills. \nAnother study indicated that sexually active rodents had more neurons in their hippocampus (a brain region linked with memory) than virgin rats. \nImprovements in brainpower were lost after sexual activity was stopped. \nResearch on the female orgasm using tests that measure brain activity has indicated sexual climax activates every part of the brain. \nBlood flows in, carrying a surge of nutrients and oxygen to the brain cells. \nBy contrast, popular brain stimulation activities such as doing Sudoku, crosswords, or playing memory games have marginal efficacy and each engage only a handful of brain regions at best. \nAdditionally, research supports a positive association between frequency of sex and recall for words in women. Sex makes you look and feel younger \nOur society places a great emphasis on youth and beauty. Few people over the age of 25 want to either look or feel older. \nBillions of dollars are spent every year on the pursuit of youth. \nOne study reported having regular sex can make both men and women look between five and seven years younger than they actually are. \nLooking younger carries with it a whole suite of benefits such as increased confidence, happiness, and enthusiasm. \nWhen we look younger, we tend to feel younger. \nSexual activity has also been associated with longevity and general health. \nThere are a ton of benefits to exercise, both physical and psychological. \nIn an average sex session, men burn around 100 calories, but women expend only about 70. \nExercise not only makes you physically healthier, but is also known to improve mood, reduce and help you cope with stress, increase feelings of self-satisfaction, increase energy levels, and the list goes on. \nRyan Anderson is a PhD candidate in the School of Arts and Social Sciences at James Cook University, Townsville. \nDavid Mitchell is deputy head and lecturer in psychology at James Cook University.
