He moved well and was involved in every attack.\" \nMuller meanwhile claimed he was merely delighted to contribute. \n\"It was really fun,\" he added. \"At some points, [the performance] took care of itself. \n\"If you win 8-0, with good weather and with a good mood in the stadium, the club, the team and the fans can go home happy.\" \nBayern are back in action at home to Schalke in the DFB-Pokal on Wednesday.
