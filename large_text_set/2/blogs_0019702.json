During his visit, Milo accused trans women of being overwhelmingly \"involved in sex crimes\". He was right - except he left out one important detail - trans women are overwhelmingly the VICTIMS of sex crimes. Bill Maher now has an opportunity to set the record straight. His show, Real Time, can now offer a voice to the trans community and book a guest who can counter Milo's incorrect data, as well as share their experiences in living their truth. In the interest of an ethical and balanced conversation, this seems only fair. Join me in urging Bill Maher and HBO to book a transgender panelist on Real Time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:57:19.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
