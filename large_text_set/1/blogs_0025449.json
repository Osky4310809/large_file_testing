This is barbaric,\" said the mosque´s president, Mohamed Yangui. Quebec police said there were many victims and deaths, but did not confirm the death toll. \nThey said two people had been arrested, but there were no immediate details on the suspects. \nA witness said a heavily armed police tactical squad was seen entering the three-storey mosque. Police declined to say whether there was a gunman inside the mosque at the time. \nPolice tweeted later that the situation was under control and that the mosque had been secured and occupants evacuated. \nYangui, who was not inside the mosque when the shooting occurred, said he got frantic calls from people at evening prayers. He did not know how many were injured, saying they had been taken to different hospitals across Quebec City. \n\"Tonight, Canadians grieve for those killed in a cowardly attack on a mosque in Quebec City. My thoughts are with victims & their families,\" Trudeau tweeted earlier in the night. \nThe shooting came on the weekend that Trudeau said Canada would welcome refugees, after US President Donald Trump suspended the US refugee program and temporarily barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States on national security grounds. \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio said police were providing additional protection for mosques in that city following the Quebec shooting. \n\"All New Yorkers should be vigilant. If you see something, say something,\" he tweeted. \nCanada´s federal Liberal legislator Greg Fergus tweeted: \"This is an act of terrorism -- the result of years of demonizing Muslims. Words matter and hateful speeches have consequences!\" \n´NOT SAFE HERE´ \nLike France, Quebec has struggled at times to reconcile its secular identity with a rising Muslim population, many of them North African emigrants. \nIn June 2016, a pig´s head was left on the doorstep of the cultural centre. \n\"We are not safe here,\" said Mohammed Oudghiri, who normally attends prayers at the mosque in the middle-class, residential area, but not on Sunday. \nOudghiri said he had lived in Quebec for 42 years but was now \"very worried\" and thinking of moving back to Morocco. \nMass shootings are rare in Canada, which has stricter gun laws than the United States, and news of the shooting sent a shockwave through mosques and community centers throughout the mostly French-language province. \n\"It´s a sad day for all Quebecers and Canadians to see a terrorist attack happen in peaceful Quebec City,\" said Mohamed Yacoub, co-chairman of an Islamic community center in a Montreal suburb. \"I hope it´s an isolated incident.\" \nIncidents of Islamophobia have increased in Quebec in recent years. The face-covering, or niqab, became a big issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election, especially in Quebec, where the vast majority of the population supported a ban on it at citizenship ceremonies. \nIn 2013, police investigated after a mosque in the Saguenay region of the province was splattered with what was believed to be pig blood. \nIn the neighboring province of Ontario, a mosque was set on fire in 2015, a day after an attack by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris. \nZebida Bendjeddou, who left the mosque earlier on Sunday evening, said the centre had received threats. \n\"In June, they´d put a pig´s head in front of the mosque. But we thought: ´Oh, they´re isolated events.´ We didn´t take it seriously. But tonight, those isolated events, they take on a different scope,\" she said. \nBendjeddou said she had not yet confirmed the names of those killed, but added: \"They´re people we know, for sure. People we knew since they were little kids.” 0 0 Canadian PM Trudeau says mosque shooting a \"terrorist attack on Muslims\" was posted in world of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on January 30, 2017 and was last updated on January 30, 2017.
