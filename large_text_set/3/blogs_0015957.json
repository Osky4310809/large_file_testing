He is correct when he says that “principals can make a real difference” and that “overlooking them is a mistake,” but there is a missing piece in his analysis. Chicago’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, is absolutely correct when he says that “principals create the environment” and that “they create a culture of accountability.” He adds, “They create a sense of community.” But the principals and administrators I have encountered were more focused on judging and assessing teachers as opposed to helping them! Judgment that is disconnected from help becomes onerous and creates a dysfunctional community. Might hiring principals with extensive classroom experience help? Judging and assessing teachers (and students) should be a means to an end, not the end itself. LARRY HOFFNER, NEW YORK The writer is a retired New York City public high school teacher. To the Editor: David Leonhardt is absolutely correct that principals are vital to a school’s success, but his article seems to accept the segregated status of our country’s schools.

These choices are the product of our country’s complicated, racist and often hypocritical approach to public schooling. Housing and education policies, paired with the individual choices of white upper-class parents, have led us to a place where our schools are more segregated than at the time of Brown v. Board of Education. Principals are critical, but they do not amount to a structural solution to economic inequality. Integration does. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
