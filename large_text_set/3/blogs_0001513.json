I don’t hold a grudge. \n“Wole Soyinka is not God. And I don’t believe there’s any human being that is absolutely right. Wole Soyinka has what I believe he has. He’s a gifted person in his own way. \n“But Wole Soyinka is not an oracle. I will not accept Wole Soyinka making cathedral statement on everything. I don’t believe that anybody could do that. \n“So it’s not a question of forgiveness. When Wole Soyinka does what I believe is right, I will commend him. When he says what I believe is not right, Wole Soyinka is a populist and I don’t believe in populism.” \nObasanjo insisted that his assessment of President Muhammadu Buhari is that he has not done badly. \n“President Buhari has not disappointed me. From what I know about him and what he has done, he has not disappointed me,” he said. \n“In my book, I said he’s not strong on the economy. And he’s not. In fact, I said he’s not strong on foreign affairs. He’s improved somewhat on foreign affairs. But in the areas we know him, he has done his best. He has done his best in fighting insurgency. He has done his best in trying to fight corruption.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T21:06:17.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
