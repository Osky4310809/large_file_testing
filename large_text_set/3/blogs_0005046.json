Is that you? 8 That was below the belt. 0 Sex tends to happen that way... 8 You may have taken my power chords joke man, but geez... 0 Since when ''Dad riffs'' are a thing? I'm spending too much time in real life it seems. 18 Well that was fucking stupid. 8 In 30 years I wonder what the kids will be listening to when \"Dad Rock\" consists of bands like Lamb of God and Rage Against the Machine. 8 This would be more accurate if they replaced all 10 riffs with Stevie Ray Vaughn riffs. 9 It's funny, but what people call \"dad rock\", I call \" good rock\", much of which I wish I'd discovered as a teenager. Has anyone considered that your taste in music just improves as you get older? 5 I just call it classic rock. Another dumb title. 1 Thanks for the list ug. Now I dont have to watch that video. 3 Bit odd Paradise City is on the list but Sweet Child O' Mine isn't, easily the most dad riiff here in Straya 4 Dad Rock nah, that's like \"Reeling in the Years\" by Steely Dan or \"Twenty five or Six to Four\" by Chicago. 2 Carry on my wayward son! South Park! 1 Should've added \"Carry On My Wayward Son\" just for the South Park reference 1 travislausch [w] 3,395 · 7 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply \"More Than a Feeling\" for sure. Probably \"Day Tripper\"-Beatles and something by George Thorogood as well. 0 I was thinking more \"Peace Of Mind\" but yeah literally any riff from the first three Boston records will do. 0 travislausch [w] 3,395 · 52 minutes ago · permalink · ↑ reply Daytripper - Beatles Satisfaction - Rolling Stones 1 The Boys Are Back in Town deserves an honorable mention. 1 lifeinshambles 90 · 9 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply Erm, what? My dad's \"dad riffs\" would be: Pink Floyd - wish you were here Led zeppelin - stairway to heaven Lionel Ritchie - hello The Beatles - and i love her Buddy holly - words of love Etc. GnR, AC/DC, etc are \"too heavy\" lmao 0 So if you played Guitar Hero a few years ago when you were 12 and liked the songs and learned them you are a dead, seems legit 1 I gotta show this to my kid... he's gona laugh his ass off.. 0 Not sure how you can include Paradise City. Im pretty sure Slash himself has said the main riff is the hardest to play. 0 Does a dad guitar have a recessed back to accommodate the dad body? 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:43:53.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
