FIFA president Gianni Infantino (Photo: Getty Images) \nEngland legend Terry Butcher compared it to an April Fool’s joke and even Brazilian World Cup winner Cafu said it would damage the level of football. \nAt least Football Association chairman Greg Clarke was open minded. “I couldn’t see the point of going out there and saying ‘over my dead body’ when it’s probably going to happen,” said Clarke. \n“Would it be good for England ? Probably not. Would it be good for growing the game around the world? It might be. Chairman of the Football Association Greg Clarke \n“Big countries, France , Germany and England are worried about what this means for the flagship global tournament. But small countries from Asia, Latin America or Africa are quite excited about having a chance to qualify.” \nThankfully, Clarke has clearly seen the bigger picture that international football should not just be about the global super powers like Germany, Spain , Brazil and Argentina . \nSurely it is time for England also to stop being so arrogant to believe that we are among the world elite, having had two disastrous tournaments in a row. \nEngland endured their worst ever performance at a World Cup finals in 2014 as they failed to get out of the Group.

It was a wonderful fairytale and the fans introduced their famous “clap” to the world. \nIt must also be a good thing that football tries to embrace more African and Asian countries to make it a truly global game. \nChina are trying to become a new footballing super power and who are we to say that they can’t? \nThere are bound to be teething problems. People did not like the uncertainty of who qualified from the Group stage in the Euros. But the Euros was a good tournament overall, even from the qualifying phase when we had a “week of football” spreading good games. \nThe three team Group phase for the World Cup has gone down badly. But it’s worth remembering that was a feature of the 1982 World Cup which is regarded by many as the best of all time. \nWe should not be so dismissive or arrogant to dismiss ideas out of hand.
