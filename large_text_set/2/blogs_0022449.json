To celebrate National Dog Biscuit Appreciation Day, we’re sharing two easy recipes which are sure to delight dogs of all sizes—one features peanut butter, bacon and banana; the other parmesan and oatmeal. Both recipes were created by Walt Disney World Resort Chefs for their furry friends at home. \nAs you can see, these treats were a big hit with Jack, Harvey, Chef Heather’s dogs Cricket and Chloe and my dog, Padme! \nPeanut Butter, Bacon, Banana Biscuits By Heather Wall, Pastry Sous Chef of Disney’s Port Orleans Resort and Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort Makes 4 – 6 dozen biscuits, depending on size \nIngredients: 1/4 cup mashed, ripe banana 2 cups smooth peanut butter 1/4 cup honey 4 cups whole wheat flour 1 cup wheat germ 1/4 cup chopped, crispy bacon \nDirections: Preheat oven to 325° F. Mix together mashed banana, peanut butter, and honey until smooth. Add in flour, wheat germ, and oatmeal. Mixture will become very dry. Add water as mixture is combining to help incorporate all ingredients. Add peanuts and bacon, making sure they are evenly distributed. Roll out dough on a floured surface to 1/4”. Cut out with your favorite cookie cutter. The size of your dog may help determine the size of the cookie cutter that you use. Any leftover dough scraps can be re-formed into a ball and rolled out until there are no more scraps remaining. Place biscuits on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and bake for 20–25 minutes. \nChef’s Notes: If you would like a crunchier dog biscuit roll the dough out to 1/8”. The baking time will be reduced to 10-20 minutes. If you use a large cookie cutter the baking time will be increased to 25 – 35 minutes. Biscuits should be used within 5-7 days. They can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 14 days. They can also be stored in the freezer to be saved even longer. \nOatmeal and Parmesan Doggie Biscuits By Scott Hunnel, Executive Chef of Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa and Marianne Hunnel, Content Development Manager, Walt Disney World Parks & Resorts Makes about 100 small biscuits \nIngredients: 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:40:59.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
