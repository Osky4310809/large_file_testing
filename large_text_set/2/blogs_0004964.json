Aller/Getty Images Rob Goldberg Featured Columnist February 5, 2017 An upset-filled Saturday in the Big 12 continued with Oklahoma State shocking No. 7 West Virginia with an 82-75 victory. ESPN Stats and Info noted the craziness in the competitive conference: ESPN Stats & Info @ESPNStatsInfo No. 2 Baylor, No. 3 Kansas and now No. 7 West Virginia. First time 3 Top-10 Big 12 teams have lost on the same day 2/5/2017, 12:07:33 AM Perhaps most surprising was that all three teams lost at home. Oklahoma State virtually couldn't miss on the road, shooting 62.5 percent from the field, 61.5 percent from three-point range and 88.9 percent from the free-throw line. While the tough West Virginia defense still forced 19 turnovers, it wasn't enough to slow down the red-hot Cowboys. They have now won four straight conference games after beginning 0-6 in the Big 12. West Virginia now sits at 6-4 in conference, still two games behind Kansas for first place. Jon Rothstein of CBSSports.com noted what this game means for the Cowboys: Jon Rothstein @JonRothstein Oklahoma State goes to Morgantown and beats West Virginia. Cowboys have now won five straight games. Trending towards an NCAA bid. 2/5/2017, 12:07:56 AM Jeffrey Carroll was the star of the day for OSU, continuing his hot shooting while leading the team with 20 points. Juwan Evans added 18 points, five assists, four rebounds and two steals while shooting 6-of-7 from the field. Lamont West was the top scorer for West Virginia with 21 points off the bench, but no starter reached double figures in the loss. Getting outrebounded 30-16 also likely ruined any chance of WVU coming away with the victory. Oklahoma State was not intimidated from the start, as it jumped out to a 15-4 lead in the first four minutes. While the Mountaineers were quickly able to even things up, it sent a message that the home court would not be much of a factor. The rest of the first half was an offensive showcase with both sides knocking down everything, leading to a 44-40 advantage for West Virginia at halftime. Keenan Cummings of Rivals.com noted the lack of defense: Keenan Cummings @rivalskeenan 2/4/2017, 11:06:21 PM The Cowboys kept hitting their shots in the second half, but West Virginia wasn't quite as fortunate, keeping the visitors ahead. This huge dunk by Davon Dillard then put all the momentum on the side of Oklahoma State, via Cowboys Basketball: Cowboy Basketball @OSUMBB", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:14:28.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
