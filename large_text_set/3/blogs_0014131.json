The publication based its claims on a trove of documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and said they were legitimate enough that German intelligence confronted the United States over it. \nAn “angry” Merkel placed a “strongly worded” call to Obama when she found out about the eavesdropping allegations, which she told him were “totally unacceptable” if true. \n“This would be a grave breach of trust,” Merkel said through her spokesman Steffen Seibert. “Such practices must immediately be put to a stop.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:30:44.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
