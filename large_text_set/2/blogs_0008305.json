The Pride, as fans of the original comic well know, represent a group of supervillains that, through their combined efforts, control crime on the west coast. The Runaways are their children who, upon learning the secret of their parents, take off on their own. Marvel previously announced Rhenzy Feliz, Lyrica Okano, Virginia Gardner, Ariela Barer, Gregg Sulkin and Allegra Acosta were locked to play the children. \n“This cast has come together in ways we couldn’t have imagined and we are thrilled to work with this outstanding group,” says Executive Producer, Jeph Loeb. \n“This cast is an abundance of riches,” says Executive Producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage. “We are so excited to have assembled our Pride, though for the fate of humanity we should be very concerned.” \n“‘Marvel’s Runaways’ has enough great actors to support two shows,” says Runaways co-creator Brian K. Vaughn, “ but I love that this project contains multiple generations of incredible talent all in one story.” \nThe full character lineup for The Pride is listed as follows: Ryan Sands as Geoffrey Wilder \nRyan Sands ( Hat Hair , The Wire ) as Geoffrey Wilder – is a man defined by the grueling path he’s taken to achieve his self-made success. A hulking presence, Geoffrey can effortlessly shift from approachable father to intimidating strategist with his son Alex. Angel Parker as Catherine Wilder \nAngel Parker ( The People v. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story , The Strain ) as Catherine Wilder – a successful lawyer, is deliberate and calculating in both her words and actions. But when it comes to her family, she’s fiercely loyal and a loving mother to her son Alex. Brittany Ishibashi as Tina Minoru \nBrittany Ishibashi ( This Is Us , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows ) as Tina Minoru – a perfectionist “tiger mom.” In her professional life, she is a brilliant innovator and ruthless CEO. Emotionally, she is less confident, often shying away from difficult conversations with her daughter Nico and careful to avoid explicit displays of her feelings. James Yaegashi as Robert Minoru \nJames Yaegashi ( Breakfast at Tiffany’s on Broadway, Madame Secretary ) as Robert Minoru – a gentle and brilliant beta, the Woz to his wife’s Jobs. Warm and feeling, Robert sometimes struggles with being married to a woman who so forcefully barricades her emotions while caring about Nico. Kevin Weisman as Dale Yorkes \nKevin Weisman ( Hello Ladies , Alias ) as Dale Yorkes – a beardy, dad-core bioengineer. Incredibly science-minded, he has a deep love for his family but oftentimes falls short at knowing the right things to say to Gert. Brigid Brannagh as Stacey Yorkes \nBrigid Brannagh ( Army Wives , True Colors ) as Stacey Yorkes – an absent-minded and professorial bioengineer. Perpetually dawning Birkenstocks and a messy bun, Stacey utilizes a progressive approach to her parenting style to Gert. Annie Wersching as Leslie Dean \nAnnie Wersching ( Timeless , The Vampire Diaries ) as Leslie Dean – a complicated beauty, is a poised and skilled leader. Clear-minded, focused, and charismatic, Leslie draws in devoted allies and followers who are taken by her success and charm, particularly with her daughter Karolina. Kip Pardue as Frank Dean \nKip Pardue ( Remember the Titans , Ray Donovan ) as Frank Dean – a former teen star who rode a short-lived movie career and is now teeming with insecurity. Floundering in his professional career as an actor, Frank is seeking to renew purpose in his life while being a father to Karolina. James Marsters as Victor Stein \nJames Marsters ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Angel ) as Victor Stein – an engineering genius who may just save the word from itself. Electric cars, space travel; the military and NASA both look to him for answers. As a father to Chase, Victor has lofty expectations for his son, and when they aren’t met, his retribution can be fierce. Ever Carradine as Janet Stein \nEver Carradine ( The Handmaids Tale , Goliath ) as Janet Stein – a perfect PTA mom. Harboring a brilliant mind of her own, she has made deep sacrifices for her husband’s world-changing career. Though she hides it for the wellbeing of her son Chase, Janet longs for more from her life. \nMarvel’s Runaways is executive produced by series showrunners/writers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage along with Marvel’s Head of Television, Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory. Fake Empire’s Lis Rowinski will produce as well. Marvel’s Runaways is a co-production with ABC Signature Studios. \nThe series is based on the Marvel comics created by the award- team of Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona.
