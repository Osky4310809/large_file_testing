At first, Nicole was reluctant to go there and told the interviewer, “God, you guys are personal!” \nRELATED: Watch Keith Urban take his latest No.1 hit to the Grand Ole Opry’s “hallowed stage” \nShe then continued, “That’s for him to talk about. He’s always said that I can talk about it publicly because he’s very much about helping people. I think us as our coupling and our marriage is an example of working our way through it with an outcome where you can be together and he’s sober and very happy.” \nWhen asked about her part in supporting Keith in his recovery, Nicole shared one very big lesson she learned on this journey. \nRELATED: Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban keep their kids in the dark about this aspect of their lives \nShe said, “I’m obviously very much involved in supporting and loving and I know a lot about it, but it’s not something I can put into a catchphrase other than I don’t believe you can save a person. They can save themselves.” Hunter Kelly , Senior Country Correspondent | Posted on", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:24:51.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
