The group is a pro-life women’s organization that lays out its aims thusly: \nSometime before we were born our womanhood was traded for a handful of birth control pills, the “privilege” to degrade ourselves in playboy, and the “right” to abort our children. \nIt’s time for the return of common sense feminism which refuses to exploit women in the name of liberation and create victims while settling for equality. Instead, we will live up to our full potential and demand others rise up to that level as we embrace how strong and bad ass women truly are. \nAlso, we’re pretty flippin’ funny and have totally rad hair. \nThey were very encouraged by being included as of Sunday morning : \nSuper pumped to rep prolife feminism at the Women’s March on Washington alongside Life Matters Journal and many other badass Prolife feminists! ❤ Can’t make it to D.C.? Let us know what city you’ll be marching in… \nThe Atlantic ran a profile on the pro-life women joining the march, which featured this quote from group president Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa : \n“I was very concerned about the fact that in 2017, our presidential candidate was such a diehard misogynist. I get that he applied this pro-life label, but I don’t know very many people who genuinely believe he’s pro-life.” \nWell, after that Atlantic piece dropped, there was apparently so much backlash to the inclusion of a pro-life group that New Wave Feminists no longer appears as a partner on the website for the march. \nAnd the group organizing the march issued a statement affirming that their platform is pro-choice and listing New Wave Feminists as a partner was an “error”: Our statement regarding press today: pic.twitter.com/z1y9cfFFvY \n— Women's March (@womensmarch) January 16, 2017 \nThe response of New Wave Feminists has been disappointment, but the group has also said they plan to march Saturday anyway. \nOne of the statements posted on the Women’s March on Washington website, focused on the march’s inclusivity , says in part, “As witnessed by the recent election, there has been a profound deepening of the divisions in our country. Etched in history, these divisions cleave us from one another across the lines of racial, ethnic, religious, and sexual identity. We seek to address these divisions and stand together in the face of injustice. Together, we will raise our voices in the service of all people.” \n[ featured image via Shutterstock ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:57:12.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
