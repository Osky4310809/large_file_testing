She has been an Arsenal supporter her whole life and has combined her passion for the club alongside working at the Emirates Stadium \n* Jehmeil Lemonius, who works for Kick It Out as the Professional Game Administrator and is a gay West Ham fan. Jehmeil also plays for Stonewall FC, the world's most successful gay football team. He also featured in the charity's Rainbow Laces campaign film \nDiscussing the new Kick It Out resources, Sports Minister Tracey Crouch said: \"Homophobic, biphobic and transphobic abuse is completely unacceptable and this partnership between Kick It Out and the government can help further tackle the issue in football. \n\"Football stadiums are much more welcoming and family friendly than they were 30 years ago. However, we must not be complacent and it is important that we continue to educate and challenge any discriminatory behaviour. It is only right that LGBT people get support across all sports and that they can participate in a safe and positive environment.\" \nWatch the short film in the video at the top of the page. \nYou can report homophobic, biphobic and transphobic discrimination to a steward or to Kick It Out via the following methods: \nKick It Out's free reporting app - available on App Store and Google Play \nFreephone 0800 169 9414", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:06:53.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
