You had your good days and your bad days, like any other job. You see what some people go through. It can be tough. They were long days – 12-hour shifts. One day, someone couldn’t come in and I did 24 hours.

It was hard, but it didn’t bother me because I love the game. \n“I didn’t want to leave, but the opportunity to play ­football professionally was one I had to take. I had to say my goodbyes to my old work and that was it. \n“There was one lad there who had epilepsy and I could relate to how he was feeling, which made my job easier. Going from that to what I’m doing, it gives you that sense of gratitude. Cup ties like these are the sort of things you tell your grandchildren about.” \nLegge still takes daily medication, but has proved epilepsy is no barrier to success in sport. Boss Derry says he has a plan to deal with in-form Leeds (Photo: Getty) \n“It’s something I’ve lived with for the last 15 years, but it has never got in my way,” he said. “More sportsmen and women have come out and said they have epilepsy. They go through the same journey as me – Greg Rutherford, James Cracknell, Matt Crooks of Rangers.” \nAfter failing to win their first eight League Two games and sitting bottom of the entire Football League, Shaun Derry’s side have won seven out of eight to now sit a point off the play-offs. \nThe visitors are in good nick too, but former Leeds player Derry said: “There is a game plan and we want to do ourselves justice.” \n* STUART DALLAS reckons Leeds’ strong recent form will count for nothing against Cambridge. \nThe Whites’ winger has seen his side go unbeaten in their last five game to raise the prospect of promotion back to the Premier League. But the Northern Ireland international warned that a place in the fourth round will have to be earned. Dallas (right) and co are on a fine run of form — but so are Cambridge (Photo: Action Images) \nDallas said: “Cambridge have been on a good run in their league, they are going to be a strong physical team like all League Two teams. \n\"We have to respect Cambridge, it is going to be a tough place to go, it is a small ground and it will be a good atmosphere. It is something the boys are looking forward to.” \nBoss Monk will make changes with one eye on Friday night's fifth vs seventh game at home to Derby, but Dallas does not think there will be any complacency. \nHe added: “I always want to play as much as I can. It is a very competitive squad, you need to be on top of your game at all times.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:41:05.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
