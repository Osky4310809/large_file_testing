By Jenny Hadfield Thursday, January 12, 2017, 10:19 am Runners finish the 2016 Boston Marathon. Victah Sailer \nThere is nothing in the world like running the Boston Marathon . The demands of the mostly downhill miles early on in the course, in combination with the rolling hills that greet you at mile 16, make for a unique challenge that requires endurance, strength, stamina, and a solid strategy. Here is a month-by-month guide on how to prepare to run strong from Hopkinton through Boylston Street. January \nSet yourself up for success by building a strong foundation of hill work, strength training, and flexibility. Include at least one hill workout each week, and begin to sprinkle hills into your long runs.

Choose a gradual incline if you’re fairly new to hills and a slightly steeper one (a four- to seven-percent grade) if you run hills regularly. Focus on running the hills by effort , to get a sense of how climbing affects your body. Don’t exceed a moderate effort level on the uphill, and run downhill at a relaxed, easy effort to recover. If you’re getting bored of repeats, try a tempo run (at a moderate effort level) on a rolling route. \nHilly Long Runs Add similar hills to your long runs and aim to maintain a consistent, conversational “Yellow Zone” effort level. This means slowing as you run uphill to conserve energy and relaxing into the downhill. This will allow you to run long more efficiently, recover more optimally, and avoid doing too much, too soon. Focus on uphill form in both workouts: Keep your torso upright (and avoid leaning forward), lift your knees, and take small steps. (Here’s more on running and racing hills by effort instead of pace.) \nStrength Workouts Include a total-body strength routine at least twice during the week to develop strength and stability in the muscles that take a beating on race day (quads, hips, and calves). Perform exercises like wall sits, single-leg squats, calf raises, lunges, bridges, planks, push-ups, and rows. \nFlexibility Work Relieve tight muscles with regular foam-rolling, and if possible, a massage every three to four weeks. This will release tight areas, allow muscles to recover and perform more optimally, and prevent aches and pains. February \nNow that you’re running hills regularly, it’s time to get Boston-specific and add in some downhill-running workouts and harder effort hill runs. \nDownhill Running Workouts Alternate your mid-week hill workout with a downhill workout. Focus on technique, relaxing into the downhill with a slight lean and quicker cadence and keeping your torso centered over your pelvis. Downhill running is hard on the body. It’s wise to start with shorter repeats on more gradual declines, and to build slowly as your body will allow. After a 10- to 15-minute easy-effort warmup, repeat four to eight times: Descend for one minute at a relaxed effort, then jog back up the hill at an easy effort and walk to catch your breath before the next interval. Cool down for 10 to 15 minutes. As you gain downhill running fitness and strength, increase the time of the downhill interval to three to five minutes. March \nThe closer the race, the more specific the training should become. This month, start some of your long runs in the mid-morning to simulate Boston’s start. (Most waves begin around 10 a.m.) This will allow you to dial in the timing of your prerace dinner, breakfast, and snack, and get a sense of how it feels to run from the midmorning into the afternoon. \nThis is also a good time to incorporate race-simulation workouts into your cutback long runs and midweek runs. For instance, for a 10-mile cutback long run, break it into three parts, run on a hilly course, with the first five or six miles at an easy effort, the next few miles at a moderate effort, and a hard effort for the final mile. \nYou can simulate the quad fatigue you’ll experience from a downhill start by cycling a hill program for 10 minutes; performing one to three 45- to 60-second sets of wall sits, single-leg squats, and squats; and then running quarter-mile hill repeats on a three- to five-percent grade with equal recovery time. Your body and mind will benefit from these dress-rehearsal workouts. April \nApril is all about tapering, preparing for the possibility of hot weather, and visualizing your race. It’s important to follow your training plan’s taper (whether it’s two or three weeks long) and continue to include hills in your long runs and midweek workouts. Just be mindful to avoid pushing too hard too close to the race (both in distance and intensity). \nThe weather in Boston in springtime can change on a dime. If you’ve been training in the cold weather, the sudden onset of warmer temperatures can quickly break you on race day. Invest in a few heat acclimatization runs on the treadmill or at mid-day with extra layers, if it is warm outside. \nPrint off a copy of the Boston Marathon route, and post it somewhere you can see it daily. Write down your race day strategy with a focus on running the hills by effort for energy management. Start and finish your day with a “Boston Marathon Mindful Minute” exercise. You can do this sitting, in the shower or bath, or even when you’re walking to warm up for or cool down from a run. Breathe in, focusing on the sound of the air in your throat. Breathe out, focusing on what you’ll do race morning. Continue to repeat this, and with each exhale, imagine moving through another part of the course. \nTraining for the Boston Marathon is all about effort and consistency. Running the Boston Marathon is all about strategy. Focus on both, and you’ll have a great race. * * * Ask Coach Jenny a running question on the AskCoachJenny Facebook page or on Twitter , get her latest posts via email , and listen to her podcast .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T09:39:29.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
