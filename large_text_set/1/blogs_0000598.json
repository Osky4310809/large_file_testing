It is a crisis made in Downing Street by this government – a crisis we warned them about. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour leader \nBut so far neither Mr Hunt nor Mrs May have commented on the crisis, with the Health Secretary accused of \"hiding\" from the situation. \nEven the Department for Health has been revealed to be referring enquires to NHS England. \nWhile figures show overstretched A&E departments have been forced to shut their doors to patients more than 140 times in December. \nAnd a third of NHS trusts in England have issued alerts that they are overstretched, according to the Nuffield Trust. \nMr Corbyn went on to say: \"The fact is this government have repeatedly failed to put the necessary resources into our health service, while they have cut social care and wasted billions on a top-down reorganisation to accelerate privatisation. \n“And despite finding billions of tax giveaways for big business and the richest, Theresa May’s Conservatives failed to find a single penny for the NHS in their autumn statement. \n\"Our NHS cannot survive if this government does not change course. Labour is calling on the government to cancel their tax breaks for the wealthiest and fund our NHS instead. GETTY Mr Corbyn called the crisis a 'national scandal' GETTY The government has been trying to establish a seven day NHS \n\"The people of this country need an explanation for the state of emergency in our hospitals, and an account of what action will be taken to end it. \n“The only person who can do that is the Prime Minister. So I am demanding that the Prime Minister comes to the House of Commons on Monday and sets out to the British people how she plans to fix her failure on the NHS.\" \nSeveral hospitals have even issued pleas on Twitter urging people to stay away from A&E unless they have a genuine emergency. GETTY Jeremy Corbyn demanded Theresa may attend Parliament debate on the NHS \nThese include hospitals in Mid Essex, Ipswich, North Cumbria, Kingston, Bristol, Buckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. \nHowever NHS England has denied the service is facing a humanitarian crisis. \nKeith Willett, the director of acute care at the health service body, said that “on the international scale of a humanitarian crisis, I do not think the NHS is at that point”. \nParliament will return from its Christmas recess on Monday for the first sitting of 2017.
