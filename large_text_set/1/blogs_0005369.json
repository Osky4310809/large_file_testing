Is Victor Moses being bullied? \nOn Monday, as Chelsea prepare for what is a massive game at Tottenham on Wednesday evening, both John Terry and Marcos Alonso appear to have ganged up on Moses. \nThe Chelsea pair have both uploaded videos to Instagram Stories taking the piss out of his flip-flops. \nEven for Chelsea fans, these videos get a little awkward and it seems strange that both Terry and Alonso would delight in making Moses feel uncomfortable.
