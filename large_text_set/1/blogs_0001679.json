(AP) — Amid reports that Charles Manson has been taken from his California prison cell to a hospital, a state corrections official would confirm only that the 82-year-old killer and cult leader was still alive. \nBoth TMZ and the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that Manson had been hospitalized. TMZ said he had been taken to a medical center in Bakersfield, about 60 miles south of Corcoran State Prison where Manson was being held. \nLate Tuesday night, three vans from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation were parked outside Bakersfield's Mercy Hospital Downtown, where state prisoners have been treated before. \nBut CDCR spokeswoman Terry Thornton said only that Manson is still alive and still assigned to the prison in Corcoran. She declined to say whether he was at the hospital in Bakersfield, citing safety privacy laws prohibit her from discussing an inmate's medical situation. \nManson was convicted of orchestrating the 1969 murders of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six others. \nTate's sister Debra Tate told The Associated Press on Tuesday night that, as a Catholic, she makes \"no ill wishes\" for the people who killed her sister, and will reserve her feelings until hearing Manson has died. \n\"I would probably say a prayer for them and shed a tear and ask God to have mercy on their souls, but so far I haven't allowed myself to feel anything because it's unsubstantiated,\" Tate said. \"I'm not allowing myself to feel anything until I know that it's true.\" \nManson was convicted of leading a cult in which disaffected young people living in a commune followed his orders and were ultimately turned into killers. \nManson and three female followers, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were convicted of murder and sentenced to death for killings at two gruesome scenes in the summer of 1969. Another defendant, Charles \"Tex\" Watson, was convicted later. \nAll were spared execution when a U.S. Supreme Court ruling temporarily banned the death penalty in 1972. \nSarah Ardalani of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in an email that the agency had no information on Manson. The office prosecuted Manson and has objected to his release. He was most recently up for parole in 2012 — his 12th bid for freedom. \nThe California State Prison, Corcoran, has medical facilities to treat inmates requiring urgent or emergency care as well as in-patient hospital stays. \n\"In general, inmates are sent to outside hospitals if they need surgical services, emergency care, or diagnostic services of an acute nature,\" said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver who controls prison medical care. \"These services are not provided in state prison facilities.\" \nIn November, the state inspector general, which monitors the corrections system, characterized care at Corcoran as \"inadequate.\" \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show the spelling of the former Manson follower's name is \"Krenwinkel,\" not \"Krenwinkle.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press Writer Olga Rodriguez contributed to this story from San Francisco. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:13:37.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
