It will be an interesting game.” \nCan, who was outstanding in midfield for the Reds, believes a share of the spoils was about right. \n“It was an open game and both sides had big chances, so I think nobody can complain about 1-1,” he added. \n“Man City had chances at the end but we had a big chance as well so I think 1-1 was okay.

I tried to help my team. It was an intense game.” \nCan reserved special praise for James Milner, who opened the scoring by dispatching his seventh penalty of the season. \n“I have never seen a player like Millie who scores penalties,” he told Liverpoolfc.com. \n“He’s incredible in training sessions - every ball is hard in the corner, he shoots penalties very well. \n“In the game he played very well, and it wasn’t an easy game for him against Raheem (Sterling). He’s quick and very difficult to play against. I’m very happy that he scored again.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:17:34.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
