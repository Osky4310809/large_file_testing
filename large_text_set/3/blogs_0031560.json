How is this different from extreme repressive interpretations of Islam (\"Sharia Law!\") mocked by people like Mike Pence \n— Xeni Jardin (@xeni) March 29, 2017 \nJardin was responding to a profile in The Washington Post on Pence’s wife Karen, in which it was mentioned that the vice president “never eats alone with a woman other than his wife and that he won’t attend events featuring alcohol without her by his side, either.”   \nIt’s worth pointing out that this has nothing to do with working with females in a professional setting, but that didn’t stop Jardin from jumping to an absurd, bigoted conclusion. It also didn’t stop her from implying he looked like a rapist. Because … why not? No need to point out he's a creep. I know. Those eyes are the eyes we see right before the assault happens. \n— Xeni Jardin (@xeni) March 29, 2017 \nIt didn’t take long for a flurry of criticism to descend upon her. “Mike Pence has rapist eyes” is a new one. Twitter is full of surprises. https://t.co/omGm0NFQjV \n— T.

When they don't, that's bad because they're like Muslims. \n— Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) March 29, 2017 \nCalling a sitting vice president a rapist is certainly a new one. One could imagine the reaction if a reporter had said that Joe Biden had “the eyes we see right before the assault happens” during the Obama administration.
