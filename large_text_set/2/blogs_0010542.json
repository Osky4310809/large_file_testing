The real question is not what North Korea has done, but what the U.S. is going to do about it,” he said. \nTrump, who dined with Abe at his Florida home Saturday evening, declined to respond to reporters’ questions about the missile test. \nThe missile was fired shortly before 8 a.m. from a known test site in North Pyongan province in the west of the country, not far from the border with China, and flew over the Korean peninsula and into the Sea of Japan, South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said.

(Kcna/Reuters) \nThey were still working to analyze data from the projectile but said it appeared to be a medium-range Musudan missile, the type that North Korea had been trying to perfect last year. The Musudan is technically capable of flying as far as 2,400 miles, putting Guam within range and almost reaching Alaska. But the joint chiefs said this missile appeared to fly only 300 miles. [ North Korea fires 3 missiles as G-20 continues in China ] \n\"The military is determining if the missile is a modified Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile or the shorter range Rodong missile,\" a military official told the South’s Yonhap News Agency. \nBut some analysts thought the launch could have been the first stages of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States. \n\"I think we’re all waiting for the first two stages of the ICBM,\" said Jeffrey Lewis of the Center for Non-proliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. \"They finished testing that engine on the stand so now it’s time to test it in the air.\" \nKim Jong Un’s regime has declared a goal of producing an inter-continental missile that can deliver a nuclear payload to the U.S. and last year appeared to be making a concerted effort toward achieving that goal. It conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests, including eight Musudan tests. Only one, in June, was a success, flying about 250 miles and reaching a surprisingly high altitude. \nBut the regime had not fired any since October, perhaps to avoid influencing domestic politics in the U.S. ahead of the presidential election and in South Korea, where the conservative president has been suspended from office and there is now a good chance of a progressive administration that is friendlier to Pyongyang. [ North Korea at the top of the agenda as Mattis heads to Seoul ] \nIn his New Year’s address, Kim said that North Korea had test-fired in various ways for a nuclear strike “to cope with the imperialists' nuclear war threats” and said that the country had “entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental ballistic missile.” In response, President Trump tweeted: “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!” \nHowever, apart from repeating the usual pledges to work stop North Korea from reaching its nuclear goals, the Trump administration has said little on what it would do to stop Kim. The administration is understood to be embarking on a view of North Korea after eight years in which the Obama administration practiced “strategic patience” – hoping that it could wait out North Korea. In Seoul, Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn convened a meeting of the national security council and said the South Korean government would work with its allies to ensure a \"concerted response to punish North Korea.\" John Wagner in Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:14:25.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
