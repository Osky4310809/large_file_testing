But what if you could do it with a flash drive? Kingston makes this possible with the announcement of the DataTraveler Ultimate Generation Terabyte ( GT ). \nThese are, so far, the USB flash drives with the highest capacities, giving you a choice of either 1TB or 2TB to be carried around in your pocket. It’s also USB 3.1 Gen 1 compatible, which will allow you to move those files around quickly. \nIt’s also pretty heavily armored, as it comes with a zinc-alloy metal casing for shock and temperature resistance, keeping data intact in temperatures ranging from -40 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit (approx. -29 to 85 degrees Celsius). As a result, it looks pretty chunky. \nAs it is, all we know is that the Kingston DataTraveler Ultimate GT will only be available in February . We don’t yet know if it will ship to this side of the globe, nor the price tag on the thing. We can easily speculate that it’ll cost much more than an equivalent portable hard drive. \nSource: ZDNet , SlashGear .
