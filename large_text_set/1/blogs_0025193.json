After initial reports said he was cleared of charges, the “Crank That” rapper was also charged with a misdemeanor for stolen property because one of the guns was allegedly stolen from a police car. \nThe assault weapons charge was for a mini Draco AR-15, which is illegal in the state of California. Soulja Boy rapped about threatening Quavo with a Draco before his arrest, and is apparently naming his upcoming album after the weapon.
