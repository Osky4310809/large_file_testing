Updated: March 24, 2017 — 8:10 AM EDT 3 Share Clem Murray / Staff Photographer The Eagles would like the NFL to change its uniform rules, which might allow them to use an alternate helmet and return to using Kelly green in their color schemes. In this 2016 photo, Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz pats guard Brandon Brooks on the helmet after the team scored a touchdown in their game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. @phillysport \nThe Eagles are proposing a new resolution at next week’s NFL meetings that could excite fans who want to see the team in alternate helmets - perhaps even the popular Kelly green helmets that are now throwbacks. \nThe Eagles want to take out the language in the league’s third uniform policy that requires “only current, primary” helmets be used as part of a third uniform. The effect of the proposal is it would permit teams to have an “alternate helmet” to be worn with a third uniform. \nThe Eagles have worn black uniforms as their third uniform, but they’ve kept their same midnight green helmets. One of the reasons why a throwback uniform didn’t make much sense for the Eagles to wear is because it would clash with the team’s current helmets. But if this rule proposal goes through, the Eagles could potentially bring back Kelly green uniforms as an alternate with the corresponding helmet. \nThe Eagles are also proposing the following rule changes: \nChange the challenge system by granting a third challenge if a team has at least one successful challenge; they currently need two successful challenges to get a third challenge. Giving additional protection to long snappers on kick plays by making the long snapper a defenseless player. There would be a foul if there’s unnecessary contact against the long snapper. Prohibit a player to “leap” over the line to try to block a field goal or extra point. Expand the “crown of the helmet” foul to include the “hairline” part of the helmet.
