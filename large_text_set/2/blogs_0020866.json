The safety of everybody participating in our project is paramount.\n— Shia LaBeouf (@thecampaignbook) February 23, 2017 \n\nFor now, there has been no word regarding a direction correlation between the gun shots and the anti-Trump protest, but Twitter users and neighboring individuals have now taken the time to report that guns have been frequently flashed on the live stream during the gathering.\nThe gunfire was some blocks away from cam.
