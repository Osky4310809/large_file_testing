ScHoolboy Q recently said he’d probably pass on the show unless his daughter wanted to check it out. \nPlenty of other Hip Hop and R&B notables are attending though, with Chance The Rapper, Rick Ross, CeeLo, 2 Chainz, French Montana and many more already past the red carpet. \nBeyoncé led the pack of nominees with nine, while Drake, Rihanna, and Kanye West scored eight nominations, and Chance The Rapper had seven. \nChance will perform during the show and has already won Best Rap Performance for “No Problems” featuring Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz. He’s also up for Best New Artist in a field that also includes Anderson .Paak. \n— Recording Academy (@RecordingAcad) February 12, 2017 \nThe majority of awards have already been announced, with the marquee categories still being held until the live television broadcast. \nDrake’s “Hotline Bling” won for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, as well as for Best Rap Song, while Solange took home Best R&B Performance. Congrats Best Rap/Sung Collaboration \"Hotline Bling\" @Drake #GRAMMYs \n— Recording Academy (@RecordingAcad) February 12, 2017 Congrats Best Rap Song \"Hotline Bling\" Aubrey Graham & Paul Jefferies, songwriters ( @Drake ) #GRAMMYs \n— Recording Academy (@RecordingAcad) February 12, 2017 Congrats Best R&B Performance \"Cranes In The Sky\" @solangeknowles #GRAMMYs \n— Recording Academy (@RecordingAcad) February 12, 2017 \n*This is a live article.
