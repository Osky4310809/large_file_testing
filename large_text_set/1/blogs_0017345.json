The actress, out of nowhere, sent out a statement revealing that she is getting married to her longtime best friend Ronnit Biswas. Reports suggested that they this rushed wedding was due to the fact that she was pregnant, but the actress denied this through her statement. However, people are still confused and want to know some more details. And so, Kavita came out and cleared all the doubts we had in one of her most candid interviews ever. \nThe popular TV actress opened up about the sudden announcement, what she thinks of marrying her best friend, pre-wedding jitters and much more. Talking to Bombay Times, Kavita revealed that even though most people did not know about her relationship with Ronnit , her inner circle of friends and family knew about it. As she mentioned to the daily, “Contrary to my image of an extrovert, I have a small but strong inner circle. I’ve been blessed with the best parents and a few amazing friends, who’ve kept a wild child like me grounded. A few have put a spy after me, too, I’m sure (laughs). So actually the people closest to me knew what was was happening in my life.” \nKavita also mentioned how she decided to get married to Ronnit on the day her father passed away. Talking candidly, she even suggested how her father was her strength for so many years and now Ronnit has become just that. As she explained, “Ron is one of my closest buddies. In fact, he is a reflection of me, not the outer image that people know of me, but the real person that I am, my habits, my dreams, the drive, the love for a simple life and more. My father was a great source of strength for me.With him around, I could goof up and not regret. I could fight the world and not be scared; he gave me the luxury to be reckless.” ALSO READ – Kavita Kaushik to tie the knot with Ronnit Biswas this month – read details \n“You know, it’s not the years or age that matures you, but when your strong father struggles to open his water bottle and looks at you meekly to open it for him, you realise that life spares no one. The three years my father fought cancer, my mom and I fought it too, not just on the outside with his medicines and hospitals, but we felt like it was attacking us from the inside, too. I was insecure and petrified of losing my dad. Each time the phone rang, I would get startled; I would dread receiving any news from home. This made me an angry and unhappy person. I was exhausted fighting it alone and that even caused me to choose wrong relationships and wrong work projects, damaging my self-confidence and individuality. I met Ron around that time. His energy was that of a companion. Ours was a platonic but close equation, which I think is the real definition of true friendship. His simplicity, his large-heartedness and compassion drew me towards him. Ron completed me. He stood next to me while I saw my father’s pyre burn and that’s where we both locked our hands to never let go. In my earlier relationships, I knew it was perhaps wrong and I was always searching for something else. But now I know that I don’t want to grow old with any other man. I’ve never been more sure,” added Kavita.

I’ve experienced the destruction when everything was going wrong and collapsing around me and Ron gave me a new hope and new life. He saw the struggling woman behind the angry, manly Chautala and kept me alive and happy after my dad. For me, he is no less than Shiva in my life because he is my saviour. The place where we are getting married is the place where Shiva and Parvati got married, if legends are to be believed. Also, I love the mountains, have trekked a lot and I’m happiest when I’m doing that, so there is no other place for me more suitable than the Himalayas.” \nBut is she having any pre-wedding jitters? Kavita clearly says that she isn’t and explains, “I’m marrying my best friend and I want to make it special for him. And for my mother too.” Published: January 22, 2017 12:55 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T09:51:05.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
