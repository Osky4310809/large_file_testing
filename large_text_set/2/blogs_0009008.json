We have the potential so let’s utilise it. \n“You can’t do what we did against Watford, where we gifted them two goals, or what we did against Chelsea, where we lacked that bit of intensity at times. \n“But I’ve had a good feeling in training and I’ve sensed how this squad demands the best from one another. \nCech: Arsenal are looking behind \n“Saturday’s game was crucial for us and the Champions League is massive for us too, because we want to prove that we can perform on an international level, when the floodlights are on. \n“The Bayern Munich tie gives us a real chance to do that again. That’s what we want to do, that’s why we play in the Champions League.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:03:34.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
