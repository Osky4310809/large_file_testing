It is in the UK’s interest for the EU to succeed politically and economically. And so we approach the negotiation to come in a spirit of goodwill and working to an outcome in our mutual benefit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:59:20.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
