According to a reliable source, US Cellular will introduce its own unlimited data plan(s) option this Friday with a starting price of $60 for a single line. \nTo be precise, an entire new line-up of single line/non-shared plans will arrive in a couple of days under the title, Total Plans. There will be 2GB ($40) and 6GB ($50) options to go along with the Unlimited plan and its higher-definition friend, Unlimited Plus. You can see a pricing chart below, but the Unlimited Total Plan will start at $60 for a single line, with Auto Pay and paperless billing enabled. The Plus option starts at $80. \nThe new plans are being billed as “Total Plans with no hidden fees,” so you shouldn’t expect activation fees, upgrade fees, monthly connection charges, or data overage charges. Taxes, regulatory fees, and any other additional subscriber services (like protection plans) will still be charged. In other words, this isn’t the flat rate T-Mobile method. \nUS Cellular’s version of unlimited data is similar to that of other carriers, in that they offer “unlimited” to a certain extent, but their plan is filled with asterisks. According to training documents reviewed by us, US Cellular’s Unlimited plan “will have the ability to stream video on a small screen, stream music, check email, use GPS, and browse the internet with a quality data experience.” What does “quality data experience” mean? Well, the Unlimited Total Plan will show “standard definition” streams (480p), so in order to get “high definition,” they’ll have to upgrade to an Unlimited Plus plan. “High definition” to US Cellular means a cap at 720p. The 2GB and 6GB plans get to stream at “full network speed,” though. \nHere is the pricing breakdown by line with Auto Pay: \nTo kick off these new plans, US Cellular is also tossing in an extra promotional discount depending on the number of lines. This is a discount to go along with the Auto Pay discount. Here are those numbers: \nAs far as other notes to be aware of with these new plans: US Cellular is suggesting that they’ll throttle the Unlimited plans at 22GB of data to 2G speeds . And I’m not talking about only when on a congested network; I’m seeing that it’s a hard throttle at 22GB. I’m not sure how that is unlimited, but OK. US Cellular will apparently not advertise the Plus option . Plans 6GB and up will include unlimited talk and text to Mexico and Canada . Stretch Data and Shared Connect plans will still be available. \nAgain, these new plans go live on Friday.
