The designer maven launched his new Spring Couture ’17 collection on Instagram over the weekend and we couldn’t stop double tapping. The Udaipur Collection featured jewellery from Kishandas For Sabyasachi and turned out to be an extravagant affair. The oh-so-powerful collection would make any girl and guy wish they were getting married tomorrow. Here’s everything you need to note about the magic created for all the to-be-Sabya-brides out there. 1. The collection opens with soft pastels hues in vintage prints and delicate embroidery.

A post shared by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (@sabyasachiofficial) on Feb 25, 2017 at 7:52am PST 3. We couldn’t stop staring at the sari having triple powers: print, brocade & sheer. A post shared by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (@sabyasachiofficial) on Feb 25, 2017 at 8:04am PST 4. The collection also showed some unmissable flower power.

A post shared by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (@sabyasachiofficial) on Feb 25, 2017 at 8:28am PST 6. Embroidered tulle sari and hand printed sherwani FTW! A post shared by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (@sabyasachiofficial) on Feb 25, 2017 at 8:40am PST 7. Plunge brocade blouse with lehenga skirt featuring antique zardosi embroidery. A post shared by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (@sabyasachiofficial) on Feb 25, 2017 at 9:00am PST 8. Then came the spectacular reds. A post shared by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (@sabyasachiofficial) on Feb 25, 2017 at 9:24am PST 9. And it ended with some exquisite bridal wear that’ll make you screenshot the designs for your D-day!
