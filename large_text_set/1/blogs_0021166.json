Ad Feedback \nIf anything Ratana has given the country a taste of the political brawls leading into the election and there's two clear competitions on that front: Winston Peters v Gareth Morgan and Labour v the Maori Party. \nThe claws are out and the war of words exchanged between Maori Party co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell and Labour leader Andrew Little over the last two days, in particular, suggest the Maori seats could be anyone's. \nAfter all, Little wouldn't be so fired up by the Maori Party's attacks if he was confident his own MPs could retain their six seats. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T06:40:08.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
