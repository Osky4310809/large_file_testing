Brady has proven he is the best ever. No team has ever come back from that much of a deficit. I don’t care what any one says, no other quarterback could have done that. He is clearly the best quarterback. EVER. whenwilliteverend says: Feb 5, 2017 10:23 PM \nShocking. Atlanta was rolling the Patriots and they decided to stop playing and gave the game away. That’s why you never take your foot off the gas. Since they went up 28-3 Matty Ice has been more like Matty Poo. Feb 5, 2017 10:25 PM \nHoly crap! Feb 5, 2017 10:25 PM \nThe Patriots should have a banner that says ” automatic first down “ zeojay says: Feb 5, 2017 10:26 PM \natl biggest choke team ever matt ryan biggest flop ever all thoes weapons and u still choking SouthStander says: Feb 5, 2017 10:26 PM \nAnd here come the overly obnoxious patriots fans. whenwilliteverend says: Feb 5, 2017 10:27 PM \nAtlanta just had the biggest choke in Super Bowl history. Maybe they should have stopped celebrating so much after getting the big lead and kept playing hard. qoojo says: Feb 5, 2017 10:27 PM \nAs a packers fan, I have to ask if Mike McCarthy consulted as a coach in the second half. fatsolio says: Feb 5, 2017 10:27 PM \nBiggest choke job in the history of pro sports. Congrats to the Pats but that was all on the Falcons for blowing that. More specifically, Matt Ryan for his horrid job in the fourth.
