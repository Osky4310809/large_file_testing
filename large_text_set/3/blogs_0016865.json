Right from the start something or the other has been coming in the way of the filmmaker and just when we thought everything had gone back to normal, some vandalizers burned the sets of Padmavati recently in Kolhapur. Not too long ago, members of the Karni Sena destroyed the sets of the film in Padmavati and created a huge ruckus there. Moreover, Sanjay Leela Bhansali was beaten up and this entire incident left the entire country and film industry in shock. With so many things happening, there were rumours doing the rounds that Bhansali might push the release date of the film. But the team has now clarified that there will be absolutely NO changes made in the release date of Padmavati. Yes, SLB has decided to not let all this come in the way of the release date of his magnum opus project Padmavati. The official page of Bhansali Prodcutions tweeted stating, “#Padmavati is releasing on 17 November 2017 No changes in release date .” Phew! Now this has come as a sigh of relief for all those who have been contemplating whether these hindrances would affect the release date of the film. #Padmavati is releasing on 17 November 2017 No changes in release date . \n— BhansaliProductionFC (@bhansaliprod_fc) March 19, 2017 \nPadmavati starring Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor is a historical drama. The real reason cited for so many issues with the film was an intimate, romantic scene between Rani Padmavati (Deepika) and Allaudin Khilji (Ranveer). The filmmaker had even issued an official statement saying that the film has no such sequence in the film but that hasn’t stopped miscreants from creating trouble for the filmmaker. The latest we get to hear is that the director’s effigies were burnt by members of the fringe group, Shri Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena in Mumbai on Friday. There has been no official statement issued by Bhansali Productions with regards to this incident so far.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T13:18:17.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
