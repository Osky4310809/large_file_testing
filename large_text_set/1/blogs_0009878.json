Â© BCCI \nThe next article due from me is one in which I fine-tune the WQAI (Wicket Quality Average Index) concept with CTD (Career-to-date) values. And then I am planning a couple on the best teams to visit various countries, inspired by the excellent suggestion by one of my long-time readers, Pawan Mathur. However, I have decided to interject a lighter article in the midst of some heavy analytical ones. But there is no shortage of effort or time in preparation of this article - that much I have found out. \nOne specific request to the readers: If you feel that this type of lighter analysis is not your cup of tea, feel free to leave the cup on the nearby table and move on. Please do not waste your (and my) time by sending comments that you do not like this type of not-so-serious analysis. That sort of comment has zero value. Thank you. \nAbout five years ago, I did a study on the topic of time spent on the field by players. It was a raw first attempt and needs to be revisited now for the following reasons: \n1. Since 2011, Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis, Rahul Dravid, Kumar Sangakkara, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Mahela Jayawardene, VVS Laxman, Michael Clarke, Virender Sehwag, Muttiah Muralitharan, Harbhajan Singh and Daniel Vettori have retired. This list includes the top-five run-getters and the top bowlers in Test history. So the numbers have changed a lot \n2. At that time, I had to do a lot more extrapolation than now since I had lot less data on the specific ball of dismissal for batsmen. Over the past 15 years, information on the specific ball of dismissal has become available for most Tests. This cuts down the need for extrapolation. \n3. About 350 more T20 games have been played since then and the T20 format has now become relatively more significant \n4. Finally, I have a chance to fine-tune the exercise with the weighting concept. \nLet me first start with some caveats. \n1. Some of these values are estimates, but based on years of following, observing and analysing the game. Variations of the order of 10% on either side can be expected. \n2. The absences of players from the field due to injuries are not considered. There is no data available on such instances. Similarly there is no data available on players spending time on the field as substitutes. Maybe, for some players, these two might cancel each other out. \n3. Almost all instances of curtailment of play due to rain, bad light, riots, dogs/streakers on the field etc are taken into account since the bowled ball is the cornerstone of this article. Also, retirement from play and resumption of the innings by a batsman, due to injury, is not a problem and is taken care of. \n4. Fielding at slip presents a totally different challenge to fielding at mid-on, which, in turn, is far more difficult than fielding at deep midwicket. This fact is acknowledged But then there isn't enough information available on where the fielders are fielding and where the catch was taken. So any attempt to categorise fielding into close-in, run-saving and in-the-deep hasn't been possible. \n5. The keeper is the one designated as such in the scorecard for the innings since keeper changes during an innings are usually not recorded. There are no problems, however, if the keeper changes in between two innings. \nThe unit of analysis is the delivery of a ball . A bowler bowls a ball to a batsman, there is a batsman at the non-striker's end, there is a keeper, exerting himself a lot, and nine other fielders, at varying levels of participation. That is a story that has repeated itself, across 139 years, 4,709,151 times (including no-balls and wides). \nDuring the very early years, a ball might have been bowled every 30 seconds. There were times during the 1980s when a ball might have been bowled every 60 seconds. Today's expectation is around 40. On balance I have taken an average of 45 seconds for every ball to be bowled. Forty-five seconds per ball leads to 13.3 overs per hour: par for today's cricket. Of course, Ravindra Jadeja might bowl two balls in 45 seconds. But as an average, 45 seconds is fine. There might be some variations between pace bowlers and spinners in the time taken to bowl a ball, but then we are not exactly sending a manned spacecraft to the moon and do not need that level of accuracy. A normal day's play of 90 overs would take just short of seven hours - a realistic scenario. \nI have classified the time any player spends on the field into the following five categories. Batting at the crease: A tough task full of concentration Batting at the non-striker's end: A relatively less strenuous task Bowling: Similar to batting, a task requiring full concentration Fielding: A neutral task, ranging from full attention at slips to having a nice, easy time at long-on Wicketkeeping: Like batting and bowling, a really difficult task requiring full concentration \nAs such, the bowling deliveries plus the keeping/fielding deliveries will be equal to the team deliveries for the duration of the players' career. This value will be unique for each player. It should also be noted that strike rate plays an important part in these numbers. Let us say that Sehwag, Tendulkar and Dravid score 50 Test runs. Using their career strike rates, Sehwag would have faced 60 balls, Tendulkar 90 and Dravid 120 balls. In general, a good ballpark estimate is that the other batsman faces an equal number of balls. So Sehwag's innings would have lasted 120 balls, Tendulkar's 180 and Dravid's 240. \nThis analysis is in two parts. The first two-thirds of the article deals with time spent as \"raw time\". That means whether the guy is batting, bowling or fielding, an hour is exactly what signifies: 3600 seconds or 80 balls. That also means, whether the player plays a ball in Test cricket, ODI cricket or T20 cricket, the time spent is the same . This is the purists' analysis. \nThe final third of the analysis weighs the time spent . I differentiate among the five classifications of time and the three formats. It is obvious that batting at the business end is quite different to being at the non-striker's end; the keeper has to concentrate a lot more than the fielder; the bowler in Tests has time to plan his bowling and can afford to send a few exploring deliveries - a luxury available to a lesser extent to the ODI bowler and not really available to the T20 bowler. Even among fielders, the T20 fielder is under greater pressure than the ODI fielder and so on. I incorporate all these aspects into a weighting table and compute the weighted time-on-field value. \nFirst, let us look at the absolute raw time-on-field (TOF) data and the related tables. The tables are current up to Test #2245, the third Test between Australia and Pakistan, in Sydney. \n1.
