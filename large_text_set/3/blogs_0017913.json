Bradley said Hernandez ordered him to pull up next to the victims’ car at a stop light, then repeatedly fired a revolver into the car. Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Abreu were killed. \nRelatives of the men wept as Bradley testified, prompting Judge Jeffrey Locke to call for a brief recess during Bradley’s testimony at Suffolk Superior Court. \nBradley said Hernandez used a racial epithet and said, “What’s up now?” before firing. \nThe former New England Patriots tight end is accused of killing the men after de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez and spilled his drink at the club. Hernandez is also charged with witness intimidation for allegedly shooting Bradley in the face months later after he became worried that Bradley would tell authorities about the earlier shootings. Bradley lost an eye in the shooting. \nHernandez has pleaded not guilty. During opening statements to the jury, his lawyer pointed the finger at Bradley, saying he shot Furtado and de Abreu over a drug deal. \nBradley is currently serving a five-year prison sentence for shooting up a bar in Hartford, Connecticut, in 2014. No one was hurt. \nHernandez is already serving a life sentence in the 2013 fatal shooting of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player 1  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:07:12.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
