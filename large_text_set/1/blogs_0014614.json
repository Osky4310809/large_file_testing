Though Blass doesn’t go into details about the speculation, we know that Google began sending emails to Android Wear developers last week regarding a rollout in February — for Blass to have learned of the precise February 9 launch date isn’t outside the realms of possibility.\nThe anticipated update will introduce the Google Play Store to Android Wear for the first time, allowing users to search for and install new apps directly from their smartwatches. The Android Wear 2.0 will also integrate Android Pay and Google Assistant, though it’s not clear if these features will appear in time for launch.\nMark your calendar: Android Wear 2.0 launches on February 9th.\n— Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 17, 2017 \n\nGoogle initially intended to release the update at the end of 2016 before it was delayed to allow the company more time to work on issues identified in the Developer Preview builds. We don’t know all of the watches set to receive the update — or how soon they will receive it after Google rolls it out — but you can find out the current smartwatches due to receive Android Wear 2.0 at the link.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T13:24:21.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
