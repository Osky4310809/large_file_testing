Local news reports, however, indicated that the JCCs that received phoned-in bomb threats on Monday included the Harry & Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; JCCs in Buffalo and Amherst, New York, according to Buffalo News; the St. Paul Jewish Community Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, according to the Star Tribune; the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center in Houston, Texas, according to the Houston Chronicle; the Levite Jewish Community Center in Birmingham, Alabama, according to the Alabama Media Group; and the Jewish Community Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to KOB-TV. \nEach JCC was temporarily evacuated and closed, according to reports. No bombs have been found on the premises of any of the JCCs. \nAt the Levite JCC in Alabama, director Betsy Lynch said the call received at the center began with the statement that there was \"a bomb in the building.\" She said she was not sure if the call was recorded or live. \n\"Anti-Semitism comes and goes in cycles, and this is a cycle. There are acts of anti-Semitism throughout the United States,\" Lynch told Haaretz. \"Alabama is a very red state, indeed, but we have received tremendous support from the greater Birmingham community. In fact, a non-Jew came into the office to join the JCC just after we resumed normal operations because he wanted to show his support.\" The Jewish Community Center daycare is being evacuated again after another bomb threat pic.twitter.com/5KDG0gFnyn — carol robinson (@RobinsonCarol) February 20, 2017 \nJeff Van Nest, a spokesman for the FBI field office in Minneapolis, said the agency is aware of the threats and will coordinate with local police. \n\"All of the resources of the FBI are available in a case like this,\" Van Nest told the Star Tribune. \"Any time there’s a bomb threat, even if it’s a hoax, is a violation of federal law.\" Statement from Mayor Coleman on this morning's bomb threat at the Jewish Community Center in St. Paul https://t.co/u4oD7vyI2s pic.twitter.com/NjS1X4kO1Z — Star Tribune (@StarTribune) February 20, 2017 \nNearly 50 JCCs in 26 states received almost 60 bomb threats in January, Haaretz reported.
