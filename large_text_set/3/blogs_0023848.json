Rather than a visa, under Trudeau's administration, border hoppers are now only required to have a so-called Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) which can be purchased online for CAD $7. \nBut, while enlightened politicians and progressive media commentators of the world endlessly praise open borders, Canada's 'average joes', much like in the U.S., are apparently overwhelmingly in favor of deporting the recent influx of illegal immigrants looking to escape the 'xenophobic', 'racist' policies of Trump's administration in the U.S. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier today, nearly half of Canadians want to deport people who are illegally crossing into Canada from the United States, and a similar number disapprove of how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is handling the influx. \nOf the 1,001 Canadian voters polled by Reuters, 48% said that illegal border hoppers should be deported back to the U.S. while a similar margin, 46%, said they disagree with how Trudeau is handling the recent immigration crisis. \n\nOf course, just like in America, Canadians are far less concerned about 'legal' immigration and instead disapprove of people who are blatantly ignoring the sanctity of international borders to immigrate to their country 'illegally'. Nonetheless, we presume the progressives of our northern neighbor still look down upon the \"xenophobic\" views of the masses with the same level of indignation afforded the silent \"racist\" majority here in the U.S. \nThe increasing flow of hundreds of asylum-seekers of African and Middle Eastern origin from the United States in recent months has become a contentious issue in Canada. \n\nThere has been broad bipartisan support for high levels of legal immigration for decades in Canada. But Trudeau has come under pressure over the flow of the illegal migrants. He is questioned about it every time he appears in parliament, from opponents on the left, who want more asylum-seekers to be allowed in, and critics on the right, who say the migrants pose a potential security risk. \n\nCanadians appeared to be just as concerned about illegal immigration as their American neighbors, according to the poll, which was conducted between March 8-9. Some 48 percent of Canadians said they supported “increasing the deportation of people living in Canada illegally.” \n\nWhen asked specifically about the recent border crossings from the United States, the same number - 48 percent - said Canada should \"send these migrants back to the U.S.\" Another 36 percent said Canada should \"accept these migrants\" and let them seek refugee status. \nMeanwhile, just over 40% of Canadians say the recent wave if illegal immigrants make their country less safe. \n\nThis sudden 'racism' epidemic, the first signs of which surfaced in the Midwest last November and resulted in the election of Donald Trump, seems to be spreading rapidly to the north and was undoubtedly planted by none other than Vladimir Putin himself...we demand that Chuck Schumer hold a hearing on this critical issue immediately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T05:51:37.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
