The longtime neighborhood option tucked up and away from the Sunset Boulevard drag is sadly moving on after reports emerged that the building underneath them had been sold off.\nA call to the coffee house and restaurant confirms that Friday, March 31 will be the final day of service for Fix Coffee, though management demurred when asked about what’s next for the space. Regardless, the loss will leave a gap in the area for all the young families and hip types who have taken over the hillside houses lately, forcing folks down to Valerie Confections not far away, or onto Sunset Boulevard for Blue Bottle or Woodcat.\nOf course, those really interested in getting their caffeine fix won’t have to look too hard across the greater Eastside spectrum. The area is littered with shops of all scope from Chinatown to Los Feliz, including similar options like Highland Cafe that also served food. The final day of service for Fix Coffee is this coming Friday.\nLA Taco Legend Yuca’s Pushed Off Hollywood Blvd Address by Landlord [ELA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:45:33.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
