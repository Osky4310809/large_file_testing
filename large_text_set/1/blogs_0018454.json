Truly, the range of activities on offer—from snowboarding, to hiking, to thermal crater swimming, to whiskey tasting—is enough to make even the calmest traveler’s head spin, especially in late January when the annual Sundance Film Festival (and its nonstop roster of premiers and parties) rolls onto the scene. Though you’ll never be left wanting for things to do in the northern Utah resort town—no matter what time of year you visit—there are some restaurants, bars, and outdoor adventures that should certainly top your must-do list. From the cutest hotel near the slopes to the tastiest chocolate-maker around, here are places that shouldn’t be missed on your next visit. \nThe lounge and fireplace at Washington School House Hotel.

One exception, however, is Washington School House . The charming, 12-room hotel is housed in a lovingly refurbished 1889 schoolhouse and decorated with a timeless mix of contemporary art and European antiques culled from the owners’ private collection. From the super-fresh chef-prepared breakfasts (served each morning under the grand chandelier in the main lounge), to the heated outdoor pool, to the cozy downstairs ski lounge, the vibe hits the perfect note between old-school luxury and low-key hygge. And, despite the prime hillside locale just steps from the central town lift, you may be tempted to just hunker down inside—especially now that the hotel has introduced a daily fireside tea service with altitude-combating herbal infusions from iconic Park City café Atticus and baked goods from the hotel’s in-house pastry chef.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T04:40:00.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
