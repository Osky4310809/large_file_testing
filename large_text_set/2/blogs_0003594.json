President Muhammadu Buhari is not well. He is sick. He is ill. He is not in London for a mere vacation. He is there to attend to his failing health. If he is not in a hospital as I write, or he is not being attended to by a medical team, then he does not love himself, and he does not love Nigeria. He should attend fully to his health in London, before returning home. He doesn’t have to hurry. After all, he followed the necessary constitutional procedure in transferring power to the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, before he left, and he has reportedly done so again in seeking an extension of his medical leave. Nothing in the foregoing, however, could absolve him and his handlers from blame for the poor management of information about his health condition. The doublespeak on the issue is beyond pardon. It all began with conflicting information about the President’s purported vacation, which was variously labelled as “a 10-day vacation”; “a medical vacation”; and “leave”. A 10-day vacation, which started on January 19, 2017, should have ended on January 29. However, before that date, we got a return date of February 6, 2017. By Sunday, February 5, as preparations were underway to receive the President, news came that he was not going to return at all on February 6 and that he had written to the National Assembly for an extension. This could only lead to more questions: Why has the President not talked to us since he left? Who has talked to him lately? By the way, how many Aso Rock correspondents went with the President on his vacation, and what can they report? I raise these questions for several reasons. First and foremost, Buhari’s health is of concern to every Nigerian because he is our President. To that extent, Buhari himself is public “property”, maintained, like public buildings at our expense. We house him and his family. We feed him and his family. We pay for his vacation. We pay for his medical expenses. We even allocated more money to Aso Rock Clinic to take care of him and his family than was allocated to virtually all teaching hospitals in federal universities in the 2017 budget. That’s why our constitution requires him to tell us at the beginning of every financial year how much he plans to spend on food, kitchen utensils, foreign trips, and Aso Rock Clinic, alongside major state projects. Second, as President, Buhari’s health is symptomatic of the health of the nation. If he coughs, the nation catches cold. If he is unable to perform his constitutional role well on account of ill-health, while sitting tight as President, the nation suffers because national affairs will fall into the hands of surrogates we did not elect and who are not directly accountable to us. It happened to us not too long ago. Even when the President properly hands over power to the Vice President, as in this case, the latter is often reluctant to fully act as President so he is not viewed either as unsympathetic to the ill President or as being power-drunk with a mere delegated authority. As a result, certain decisions may not be taken as they normally should. Third, whenever the President is not forthcoming about his health condition, an excessively large room is opened for rumour-mongering and even cruel jokes. In Buhari’s case, social media and blogs are awash with all kinds of stories about his health status and the outcome of his treatment in London. There is the story about someone who was arrested in Abuja for writing RIP on Buhari’s photograph or so. When asked by the judge what he meant by RIP, the fellow was reported as claiming it meant Remain In Power. True or not, this story points to two interesting sides of the Buhari health controversy. On the one hand, there are those who claim he is no longer alive. For such people, RIP retains its traditional meaning in our lingo, namely, Rest In Peace. This led a fellow The PUNCH columnist, Abimbola Adelakun, to advance various reasons why some Nigerians would wish their President dead. What Adelakun did not discuss is how to avoid death wishes on our President. I will return to that shortly. On the other hand, there are those who brand the death wishers as cruel, insensitive, mischievous, and inhuman. Among them are those who went to the ridiculous extent of recommending that such people should be arrested, not minding the people’s right to freedom of speech. One Haruna Muitala even went further to claim on Facebook that there would be war were Buhari to die, “because this power belong (sic) to the North”. How many arrests will anyone be able to make over social media, where the death wishes thrive and where Muitala made his outrageous claim? Anyway, the important point here is that Buhari loyalists insist that he is hale and hearty. This “hale and hearty” claim leads to the fourth reason for raising questions about Buhari’s health. The historical reference of the claim in our recent history reminds us that the fellow for whom it was used never made it. So, why go that route again? What is it about the Nigerian President and his handlers that makes it impossible for them to come straight with the Nigerian people? Is it a sin for the President to be sick? Wouldn’t he have attracted much more sympathy from the people if, in fact, we were told from the onset that the President was sick and was going abroad for treatment? Why hide under a vacation, from which he would neither be seen nor heard? Another dimension of the Buhari health controversy is its use as the reference point for discussing his perceived lacklustre performance to date. However one might argue that he should not be blamed for the present situation in the country, especially the economic recession, the handling of the President’s illness has not helped matters at all. Already, heated discussions are ongoing in the mainstream media about Buhari’s performance, some blaming it on sheer incompetence, while others point to the state of his health as a major hindrance. Could Buhari’s aloofness, taciturnity, and inaudible diction be blamed on his poor health? What makes matters worse on the Buhari health controversy is the claim, now dispelled, that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was being compelled to resign. If nothing else, the claim further fuelled the death story, suggesting that Osinbajo was being pushed out apparently so that a Northerner could step in Buhari’s shoes. The claim was quickly interpreted as pointing to some knowledge about Buhari’s health status or decision that other Nigerians knew nothing about. In any case, even if Buhari were not to resume as President, hasn’t the constitutional procedure as to presidential succession been settled in the case of Umaru Yar’Adua and Goodluck Jonathan? The handling of Buhari’s health and his treatment abroad has once again been poorly handled, much like many other issues in the last 18 months. Save for the fight against Boko Haram, everything else has witnessed doublespeak and lacklustre performance, including the fight against corruption; curbing herdsmen-farmers clashes; pipeline vandalism; and preventing further economic decline. When will this administration be able to speak with one voice on the same issue, deal with matters without discrimination, and desist from withholding necessary information, so that the citizens will also be on the same page with the administration? Given the ravaging economic recession and various forms of insecurity in the land, this is one period in our history when the citizens need a government that respects them by taking them along on major issues, including the President’s health.
