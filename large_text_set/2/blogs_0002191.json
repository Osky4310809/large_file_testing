The people at the check-in told me that I was not allowed to take the plane because of the new rules. \n\"[...] The only thing that I've found is a direct flight from San Jose to Madrid.\" \nNew flights back to Glasgow via Madrid were set to cost her and her boyfriend almost £2600 ($3,260). \n\"We've spent all our money for the next months,\" she told the BBC. \"I don't know how we [will] afford to pay the rent, the bills, and the food...\" Image copyright Hamaseh Tayari Image caption Hamaseh Tayari holds an Iranian passport but lives and works in Scotland Image copyright Hamaseh Tayari Image caption United Airlines told Hamaseh Tayari she had been prevented from travelling \nA few hours after she spoke to BBC Radio Scotland, a crowd-funding appeal launched by Women for Independence raised £6,175 to get Dr Tayari and her boyfriend home. \nThe emotional vet described the appeal as \"amazing\". \nThe remainder of the money will be donated to the Scottish Refugee Council. \nFunds raised for stranded US ban vet 'This ban is so demeaning' \nBatool Shannan, a Syrian in Essen, Germany, was due to travel to the US in a week's time. \nShe is a scientist working in skin cancer research, and has previously worked in America. \n\"I'm a Syrian who left Syria in 2012 to work in Philadelphia for two and a half years,\" she told the BBC. \"I then moved to Germany, where I have been ever since. \n\"I applied and got a B1/B2 [visitor's] visa and was going to Philadelphia on 8 February for a vacation and to visit my old colleagues. I'm a scientist and work on melanoma research, and collaborations are so important. Now, not only am I banned from going - I'm not sure I can cancel my flights [the trip cost around 1,000 Euros ($1,069 / £852) - flights and visa]. \n\"The feeling of injustice is so big, and this ban is so demeaning! Shame!\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The ban is affecting foreigners with US visas or green cards who are currently abroad Media caption A transgender Iraqi woman says her dreams have been \"shattered\" by the president's order 'Dreams shattered by the stroke of a pen' \nMusa Sharkawi, a cardiology fellow from Jordan, is training in Connecticut and was recently joined by his wife - a Syrian doctor. \n\"As a Syrian passport holder, she cannot leave the country as she would not be permitted to return,\" he said. \n\"Her family cannot visit us as they have been banned from obtaining American visas. The new executive order is literally ripping families apart and worse. \n\"Many dreams have been shattered by the stroke of the pen of the new president. Many young bright doctors have spent years preparing for and taking licensing exams that have cost thousands of dollars. \n\"I was the chief resident at the hospital where I did my training, and treated thousands of patients. I have published numerous research papers and books chapters. I have taught and trained hundreds of medical students and junior doctors, both American and foreign. \n\"This is a dramatic change in attitude and one that will dissuade a lot of bright young minds from pursuing the American dream.\" 'I thought a Green Card was permanent' \nSome of those affected by the entry restrictions are already considering a permanent move away from the US. \nOne Iranian professional working in the Washington DC area told the BBC his wife had gone back to Iran while she waited for her visa to be renewed. The process took five months, and now she is trapped overseas. \n\"I have been hearing some shocking stories. Even people with Green Cards are not being allowed into the US. I thought the Green Card was called a permanent residency - but apparently it's not so permanent!\" \nHe says that joining his wife back in Iran is one option - but otherwise the pair will take their experience of living abroad, and try to resettle. \n\"We may try our chances with other countries [...] Maybe Canada or Australia. We'll see if we can transfer and start over.\" My visa is \"not enough\" Media caption Iraqi Fuad Suleman, who was turned back in Cairo, says he and his family had been preparing to emigrate to the US for two years \nFuad Suleman, an Iraqi national, was granted a valid visa to move to the US with his family. He says he worked on projects funded by US organizations in the years following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, so when security conditions in Iraq deteriorated he applied via the Special Immigrant Visa programme, which has been created to assist thousands of Iraqis who helped the Americans. But the Sulemans were turned back when they tried to board a connecting flight from Cairo. \nHave you or your family been affected by the entry restrictions?
