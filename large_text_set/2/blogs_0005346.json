And we love her positive attitude about coming back to do the work after giving birth . She admitted she was super hesitant to go through with the shoot at first, but eventually totally warmed up to being in front of the camera — stretch marks and all .\n“It’s been awhile since I’ve done anything swimsuit. I haven’t shot since baby. But of course you know that [the Swimsuit editor] MJ, and everyone at Sports Illustrated in general, is going to embrace your body no matter what’s happening and embrace the changes,” she said in a behind-the-scenes clip. And here’s one of the photos. Look at her work it! Just months after giving birth, @chrissyteigen got BACK in a bikini for SI Swimsuit... \nA photo posted by Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@si_swimsuit) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:04am PST \nUnsurprisingly, Teigen received very high praise from Sports Illustrated Swimsuit editor MJ Day. “I told her she has to have a baby every year because I’ve never seen her look so good, and move so great, and take such amazing pictures.” Yup, that’s our girl. Inspiring everyone, all the time.\nHere’s the behind-the-scene clip, where you can see how effortlessly Teigen displays her body and personality in front of the camera. As well as being beautiful, she’s incredibly charismatic and fun, and it looks like she genuinely enjoys what she does — which encourages everyone around her to enjoy it.\nWay to go, girl. We are SO freaking proud of Teigen for going out there and showing us what she’s made of!\n\nAs a mother it’s nice to be able to be back in your element, and it’s important to my well-being that I come out and I’m able to do this and do something I’m proud of,” she said in the behind-the-scenes clip. A photo posted by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Jan 4, 2017 at 2:22pm PST \nAs a mom, she’s always been open about her experiences, from losing baby weight so fast , to peeing after giving birth ! Yup, nothing is off limits, and we’re grateful for her emotional generosity that spreads good vibes far and wide. Whether a personal or professional task, she continuously gives everything her all.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:57:19.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
