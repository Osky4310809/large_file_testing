Truman. \nThe newest Gallup survey — a “tracking” poll which averages daily results from the last three days — places Trump at a stunningly low 38 percent approval rating just four weeks into his term, a point at which most presidents are experiencing not their lowest approval ratings, but some of their highest. \nThe latest @Gallup poll has #Trump ‘s job-approval rating at 38%, with 56% disapproving –> https://t.co/vkgpHgRiKX pic.twitter.com/OI2W7hvkqm \n— AM Joy w/Joy Reid (@amjoyshow) February 17, 2017 \nAfter about four weeks of his first term in 2009, Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama was cruising along with a 62 percent approval rating, almost twice as high as Trump’s at a similar point. Even Truman, who still holds the record for lowest single-day approval rating in the Gallup poll, held a whopping 87 percent approval rating 54 days after he was elevated into the presidential seat following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The 54-day mark is the earliest point for which Gallup has data on Truman’s job approval. \nBut by day 2,499 of Truman’s presidency, February 13, 1952 — the height of United States involvement in the Korean War — Truman set an all-time Gallup poll record low with an approval rating of just 22 percent.

While Truman set a record for the lowest apprpval rating, Eisenhower was popular throughout his two terms.

He hit his low of 40 percent on October 8, 2011 — day 992 of his time in office, 2.7 years in. \nPresident George W. Bush needed 2,807 days — 7.7 years, nearly the end of his eight years in office — to bottom out at 27 percent . Even though Bush, like Trump, was elected president by winning the Electoral College while losing the popular vote, his early days as president saw him riding a wave of public approval. \nAfter one month of his term, Bush’s approval rating sat at 62 percent. President George W. Bush was midway through his second term before he hit the approval rating low where Donald Trump is now.

For Nixon, that was the midst of the Watergate scandal , and a standoff between the president and congress with Nixon refusing to turn over documents crucial to the congressional investigations of the scandal, claiming “executive privilege.” MORE DONALD TRUMP COVERAGE FROM THE INQUISITR:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:12:20.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
