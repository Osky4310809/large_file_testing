But if he’s truly not in Conte’s plans — which, in fairness, would run contrary to all public utterances regarding this subject, for whatever those may be worth — then sending him out on loan would possibly be the best solution in a situation with no good solutions. West Ham United and Crystal Palace have been regularly linked with a potential Michy loan , as have a few European teams, but surely we’d like to keep him closer to home. Batshuayi is on his way to West Ham or Crystal Palace on loan. Llorente could join Conte at Chelsea. #CFC (Di Marzio) pic.twitter.com/bl87btHj2i — Conteholic (@Conteholic) January 5, 2017 The complementary part of this backup striker dance is also a story that we’ve heard before , namely that Chelsea are exploring the possibility of acquiring Swansea striker Fernando Llorente , who spent a season with Conte at Juventus a few years ago. Some sources, such as Fabrizio Romano have gone as far as to claim that we’re “in talks” for him already but it won’t be easy. Whatever that means. Chelsea in talks for Fernando Llorente. Not an easy deal. Antonio Conte asked for him (they worked together at Juventus). #CFC #transfers — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 6, 2017 Hmmm...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T09:43:14.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
