The paper is part of Rupert Murdoch's news empire, which includes Fox News Channel whose anchors are openly pro-Trump. \nThe piece - which minces no words - comes amidst a confirmation hearing for Mr Trump’s Supreme Court nomination and a critical vote in Congress on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Sean Spicer relaxes on 'fake news' CNN - after airing pro-Trump poll \nInstead of the spotlight being on possible ‘wins’ for the administration, “the week has been dominated by the news that he was repudiated by his own FBI director“ James Comey during a Congressional hearing, according to the editorial board. \nThere is also the news of Paul Manafort, Mr Trump’s former campaign chairman, who allegedly worked for a Russian billionaire in order to benefit President Vladimir Putin. \nThe editorial board said Mr Trump’s promotion of “fake news” is doing “damage” to his reputation, referring to his accusations that former President Barack Obama had Trump Tower in New York wiretapped during the 2016 presidential campaign without providing any evidence. \nMr Comey said during the Congressional hearing that there was no evidence that Mr Trump’s claim is true. \nMr Trump seems to have a “seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods,” the editorial board wrote. \nThe editorial board wrote that the real problem is that he does not walk back his claims once proven wrong or provide the public with any sign of his humility.
