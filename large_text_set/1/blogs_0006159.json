Last year, X-Men: Apocalypse hit theaters with a slew of new characters, but a few returning heroes decided to appear as well. One of those fan-favorite mutants didn’t quite make it out of the film, and audiences were surprised to see the superhero die so suddenly. Now, the actor is speaking out about his character’s shocking end, and the leading man admits he thinks his on-screen death was pretty cool. UP NEXT: How X-Men's Apocalypse Affected The Mummy \nDuring a recent interview with CinemaBlend , Lucas Till opened up about his character’s death in X-Men: Apocalypse . The actor, who played Havoc, confessed he was alright with the boy being killed off. \n“I thought it was really cool. I feel like people are always like 'Oh, it's X-Men . It's X-Men you can always come back.' But I was like 'No, I think it's cool that I died.' I think people were kind of nervous to tell me that I died but I thought it was really neat.” \nClearly, Till has grown tired of superhero films and their penchant for reviving main characters at the last moment. Comic book adaptations are filled with last-minute saviors and deus ex machina style intervention. Over the years, fans have grown critical of these overused plot devices, so it was refreshing for audiences to see Havoc’s death mean something. Alex Summer’s death was a key catalyst for his younger brother Scott’s upward storyline, and the brutal demise made Apocalypse a more tangible threat to the X-Men. \nHowever, Till does realize that Havoc’s fate is up to 20th Century Fox, so the character would be revived in future films should the studio wish it. \n“It is X-Men and you don't really see me die,” Till hedged. “If I can withstand cosmic energy coming from my chest I might be able to withstand some extreme levels of heat. Maybe that level fell just right so that maybe I survived, I don't know. I thought it was cool though.” \nFollowing the critically acclaimed global smash hit X-Men: Days of Future Past, director Bryan Singer returns with X-MEN: APOCALYPSE. Since the dawn of civilization, he was worshipped as a god. Apocalypse, the first and most powerful mutant from Marvel’s X-Men universe, amassed the powers of many other mutants, becoming immortal and invincible. Upon awakening after thousands of years, he is disillusioned with the world as he finds it and recruits a team of powerful mutants, including a disheartened Magneto (Michael Fassbender), to cleanse mankind and create a new world order, over which he will reign. As the fate of the Earth hangs in the balance, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) with the help of Professor X (James McAvoy) must lead a team of young X-Men to stop their greatest nemesis and save mankind from complete destruction.
