And as he sees it, the one of those currently holding the US presidency is making critics less receptive to Danny’s story. \n“I think the world has changed a lot since we were filming that television show,” he said in the interview. “I’m playing a white American billionaire superhero, at a time when the white American billionaire archetype is public enemy number one, especially in the US.

The first six episodes are available to critics, and Jones said he thinks it takes seeing more of the 13-episode series (and the next one the character of the Iron Fist will take part in, “Defenders”) to really understand his journey. \nJones is probably correct that the political climate has a lot to do with how the show is being received. But it’s very likely events such as Trump’s ban on travelers from several mostly Muslim nations, and not Danny Rand’s billionaire status, is what has critics giving “Iron Fist” side eye. \nThe show went into production amid an increasingly prominent conversation about the lack of Asian-American or Asian representation in American film and TV. A conversation that was intensified by another Marvel production, 2016’s “Doctor Strange,” which drew much criticism for casting Tilda Swinton in a role written as an Asian Man in the original comics.

But given that stories about white men who reap the benefits of “Eastern” wisdom and far surpass the achievements of Asians have fallen far out of favor, before the series began filming, many suggested that an Asian actor should have been cast in the role of Danny, rather than a white one. \nNegative reviews, so far at least, have singled out plotting, writing, and tone for criticism. And they have made much more discussion of how “Iron Fist” depicts Danny Rand in relation to Asian characters and traditions, than they have of Danny Rand’s socioeconomic status. It would seem then that whatever the show’s problems may or may not be, they are deeper and less recent than the 45th president of the United States. Every Marvel Comics Live-Action TV Show Ranked, from 'The Incredible Hulk' to 'Legion' (Photos) \nThe recent high-profile shows on Netflix, ABC and FX aren't the first ones Marvel has taken to the small screen. Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, Blade and even knock-off-ish X-Men had a go before the current golden age. Here are all the Marvel shows, ranked from goofiest pajama costumes to best character-driven dramas. \n12. “The Amazing Spider-Man” (1977-79) A 1977 attempt at a live-action “Spider-Man” is a fun throwback -- but in a purely ironic way because Peter Parker’s wall-crawling \"special effects\" are pretty cringe-worthy. Watching Spider-Man fight guys using extremely hokey choreography gives the whole thing a pretty goofy vibe. \n11. “Spidey Super Stories” (1974-77) Spider-Man takes on some super-boring villains. He goes up against The Prankster (a school principal who keeps pranking his students) and The Spoiler (who just likes to everyday things for people) in these goofy sketches in PBS’ “The Electric Company.” Worth a few minutes of watching on YouTube. \n10. \"Mutant X\" (2001-04) Delightfully 2001 in every way, the syndicated “Mutant X” is the knock-off \"X-Men\" TV show with a low budget a lot of people probably wanted. With obviously pulled punches and early CGI, “Mutant X” scratches an itch for a brand of superhero show that’s completely rooted in the world of 20 years ago. \n9. “Blade: The Series” (2006) Spike TV took the successful “Blade” movies and made a TV show. It’s a decent precursor to the grittier Marvel takes that would later show up on Netflix. Violent, blood-splattered vampire hunting couldn’t hold an audience in 2006, though. \n8. “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” (2013-current) For much of its run, “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” has been more or less answering the question, “Hey, what are the normal people up to?” That can be pretty engaging, although keeping the show up with the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe continuity on a budget sometimes reigns it in. \n7. \"The Incredible Hulk\" (1977-82) Green Lou Ferrigno helped carry “The Incredible Hulk” through five seasons. The formula of David Banner wandering around America, getting into adventures and helping people, is pretty standard for TV. But there’s plenty of wrong-doers to trigger the Hulk’s rage and get him involved — for justice. \n6. “Spider-Man” (1978-79) A pretty deep departure from the Marvel Comics stories, the Japanese take on “Spider-Man” is worth a look just for the way Spider-man pushes a button on a bracelet that shoots out his suit. This version fully understands to folly of trying to make a serious Spider-Man thing in the '70s and goes gleefully the other way with plenty of self-awareness. \n5. “Agent Carter” (2015-16) TV gives Marvel the chance to dig into smaller side stories adjacent to its movies. “Agent Carter” takes that idea to its logical extent, turning out a period show led by a woman and Captain America pal. It gets to explore minor characters pretty intimately, while adding depth to the world when it comes time to turn on an “Avengers” movie. \n4. “Daredevil” (2015-current) The first of Netflix and more down-to-earth superhero TV shows that take place in shadow of the Marvel Cinematic Universe does a great job of making Daredevil seem like a mostly regular dude. It’s also full of great, visceral fight scenes that pack an intensity that CGI can’t really achieve. \n3. “Luke Cage” (2016-current) Giving a different perspective on superheroes than anything that’s come before it, Netflix’s “Luke Cage” adds breadth to the MCU that shows how deep and interesting it can be. It’s also very aware of its time and place in culture and doesn’t shy away from the issues inherent in focusing on a bulletproof black man. \n2. “Jessica Jones” (2016-current) Another lower-key superhero story, “Jessica Jones” brings heroes and villains down to their very human flaws. The way it taps into and explores feminist themes gives a whole different take on the idea of superpowers in the Marvel universe. \n1. “Legion” (2017-current) Visually gorgeous, this slow-burn look at one of the “X-Men” universe’s most powerful mutants does, so far, a phenomenal job of exploring its anti-hero. The focus on the mystery of David’s sanity digs deep into what it’s like, and how to cope, with being a mutant in a way that’s very different from other “X-Men” takes.
