Obasanjo spoke at the opening ceremony of a five-day third biennial international conference, which has the theme, ‘Polity debacle and the burden of being in Africa,’ organised by the Faculty of Arts, University of Ibadan. He was represented at the event by the Deputy Coordinator, Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Mr. Ayodele Aderinwale. The former President said for the African continent to overcome its numerous socio-economic and political challenges, which had formed a hurdle against its progress, African leaders needed to stand firm in the fight against treasury looters. He said, “There should be no respite, there should be no hiding place for treasury looters. And good people with ideas must come forward to be counted, get elected or supported by good people to grow the economy and provide solid infrastructure.” Obasanjo noted that it was important for Africa to build human capital rather than material resources and for African leaders to make changes that would reduce corruption and generate the laws, policies and practices needed to enhance efforts aimed at catching up with the rest of the world. He said, “African citizens on their part will have to create the popular pressures that will put African leaders to address the challenges of leadership, fiscal and economic, managerial, infrastructure, industrial and technological deficits. “The town and gown must collaborate to make Africa the best. Those in political leadership position must ensure policy framework and enabling environment to provide public infrastructure. “There is need to restore the social justice issues around resource control, citizenship and governance. Let me state unequivocally that our standards of living will rise the moment we take our destiny in our hands. I know we have what it takes.” At the event, renowned management expert, Prof. Pat Utomi; a former presidential spokesman, Dr. Reuben Abati; and Professor Emeritus Ayo Bamgbose; spoke on possible solutions to underdevelopment in Africa. Utomi attributed African deficiency to the collapse of culture, weak institutions, wrong policy choices that depleted progress and unfavourable disposition of leadership to human capital development. The keynote speaker, Prof. Akanmu Adebayo, who is a professor of History and Conflict Management at the Kennesaw State University, US, said the cost of governance in Nigeria and other African countries was too high and not sustainable. He called on the leaders to sustain the fight against corruption, noting that studies had shown that the leadership elite had been forming alliance with the economic elite, and the traditional rulers to perpetuate themselves in power. Adebayo warned that attention should not only be focused on public governance but governance of religious and traditional institutions. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
