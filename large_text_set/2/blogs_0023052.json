It's a stunning glimpse at the titular ship's crew relaxing together with a final meal before readying themselves for a long cryogenic sleep.\nTitled, \"Prologue: Last Supper,\" this four-minute preview has many of the tropes we expect from an Alien movie. There's the harshly-lit cast of characters, some creepy moments of foreboding and a technologically plausible background, like pre-cryo vitamin packs and a spaceship that looks more functional than pretty. There's even a pretty fantastic callback to the original movie's famous dinner scene.\nThe overall tone of this new trailer is nostalgic, with the couples intended to colonize a new world waxing poetic about what meals they'll miss the most while spending their last few moments together around the ship's table. There's a striking moment when Katherine Waterston's terraforming expert, Daniels, addresses the crew that's posed just like DaVinci's well-known mural . It's a brilliant way to remind viewers just how awful things will get once the Xenomorphs arrive.\nThis is the sixth movie in the sci-fi series, and a sequel to 2012's Prometheus , also directed by Ridley Scott , making Alien: Covenant the third Scott-helmed movie in the franchise. Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace also reprise their roles from Prometheus, though Fassbender's android here is a more advanced model named Walter.\nAlien: Covenant is set to release March 19 in theaters, so we don't have too much longer to wait for this high-concept, hard science fiction entry into the beloved series.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0VW6sg50Pk", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Supper_(Leonardo_da_Vinci)", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkXgRlRao5I?wmode=opaque"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:59:23.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
