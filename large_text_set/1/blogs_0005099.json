ADVERTISEMENT \nAlex Cabagnot also played despite his broken nose, finishing with 14 markers, nine rebounds, and three dimes in the victory. \n“I think this is a good new year for us. We had a good start and I think this is what we’re waiting for,” said coach Leo Austria, as San Miguel clinched the first quarterfinals berth. “I hope we sustain what we’re doing.” \nWith the Beermen in sync, they cruised to a 29-point lead, 69-40, behind a pair of Fajardo freebies early in the third period, allowing Austria to field in his bench players for the majority of the second half. \nBlackwater saw an opening with Raymond Aguilar and Roi Sumang staging a late comeback and trimming the deficit to as low as 11, 101-90, with 4:23 left. But San Miguel put its foot down behind Fajardo, Cabagnot, and Ross for its fifth straight win. \n“With this kind of performance, we have to step up more. I think the next two games will be important for us to avoid any complications.” \nThe Beermen will brace for Ginebra on Sunday, Rain or Shine next Friday, and will wrap the eliminations up against GlobalPort and TNT. \nArt dela Cruz topped Blackwater with 16 points and nine rebounds, while Aguilar had 15 markers, 10 coming in the fourth. \nMac Belo was held to just four points in the tiff, as the Elite shot 7-of-17 from the free throw line. \nBlackwater sunk to sixth place with an even 4-4 slate.
