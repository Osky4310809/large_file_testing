Trump has met with CEOs at Ford, General Motors and Boeing and asked them to create jobs in the United States, while touting each announcement about new factory jobs as a success even if those additions had been planned before his presidential victory. \nSchultz added: “I am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T12:28:46.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
