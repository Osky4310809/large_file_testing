It was the first time you insisted on putting a sticking on my car. He was responsible for your main enthusiasm. So important in our lives”. \nGraham Taylor was the reason I got interested in football. Without him, I would not have got involved with the Collyer Brothers to work on Championship Manager, nor moved onto Football Manager. I wouldn’t spend my weekends travelling round the country to games. I would have a completely different set of friends. Or possibly no friends at all. \nAs a six year-old, I wasn’t a fan of football. There was an air of excitement in Watford, the place that I grew up, when Elton John took over the club, and then more excited when this young manager had been hand-picked by Elton to take Watford from the doldrums of the lowest of league football to try and get into Europe. I started reading about this journey at a time when we were in the fourth division, and the enthusiasm for what was happening, not just on the pitch, but with the “family club” atmosphere off it was infectious.

She read Woman’s Own and did a crossword in the newspaper, whilst I belted out “Elton John’s Taylor made army” at the top of my squeaky voice. I was mesmerised with what was going on on the pitch and the man on the touchline. \nMore trips followed. I became obsessive reading every article and every interview about the club, writing quotes from Mr. Taylor on my schoolbooks. And take us to Europe he did. But you all know about that already. Read More Graham Taylor's greatest achievement was turning Watford into an oasis of safety in an age of hooliganism \nGraham Taylor was not your ordinary manager. His aura seeped throughout everything at the club. That’s why you’ve seen social media flooded with stories and praise for him. He took unheard of players and helped them become superstars. He signed John Barnes for some tracksuits and some footballs. He rescued careers. He developed his own brand of football that some purists called “long ball”, but when you had wingers like John Barnes and Nigel Callaghan it would seem a bit silly to not pass the ball to them at every opportunity. Taylor and chairman John with supporters in 1984 \nIt wasn't only his tactical choices that were different. His set pieces were too. Blocking the opposition walls view by putting his own wall in front of them was just one of the tricks. Unique, and effective. \nOff the pitch he was just as important to the community at Watford as he was on it. Our ground is built next to a hospital, and Mr. Taylor was not only a regular visitor to visit Watford supporters who were in there, but he took the players with him. He made sure players were at school sports days handing out the prizes, going to events in the town, making sure that the whole town were proud of the club – and even those who supported others were exactly that. Read More \"He was like a brother to me\": Elton John pays emotional tribute to Graham Taylor \nHe put in a family stand and a family terrace. I grew up on that terrace and met many people who are still friends today – two of whom now work at the club. He is responsible for those friendships. \nYou can only understand the mark of the man from some of the stories that have been coming out since he passed. After giving up management, Taylor spent time as a pundit and speaker (Photo: Getty Images) \nMy first direct contract with Mr. Taylor, away from the family open days when he’d try and talk to everyone, was after a game that I’d been to that I’d saved my pocket money to go and see. We were hammered on the day. And what hurt me as a young supporter was how the players didn’t look like they’d been trying. There was no social media for me to complain on, so I wrote a letter to him and posted it to the club. Four days later I got a phone call – I still don’t know how he’d got my number, but he did. He asked if he could read my letter to the players as I was right, and he wanted them to know how much it hurt the supporters. Read More An Impossible Job: The infamous documentary that changed Graham Taylor's life \nIn his second spell as manager at the club, a few years down the line, the club arranged a pre-season tour to Ireland. Me and some friends thought a weekend in Dublin was a very good idea, so went to watch Watford playing St. Patrick’s Athletic. We were standing outside the front of the stadium with Guinness in hand, when out strolled Mr. Taylor. “We’ve got a young lad making his debut today named Stevie Brooker. He’s really nervous, but has a lovely left foot on him. Can you get a song ready for him?” He then grabbed a half drunk pint out of one of my mates hand, downed it, and walked off.

But this season I’ve been lucky to spend some quality time with him on a couple of occasions. At the start of the season, I excitedly took him to see the newly laid pitch at Vicarage Road which looked impeccable. “I wish we’d had that in my day,” he said, staring at the pitch for a few minutes whilst chatting before going back upstairs to join his wife, Rita. \nI saw him last just a couple of weeks ago and spent an hour listening to some of the greatest stories – including a chat with John Motson about how he had called John’s wife within hours of the birth of their child to congratulate them – before John had managed to talk to her himself.

How when he was first called about the Watford job it was a call from Bertie Mee who didn’t mention the club involved. For a short while, he thought he was up for a job at Arsenal. And didn’t know who Elton John was when he called. But realised when he met Elton that they were meant to work together and how close they’d become. How John Barnes had deliberately hit the bar from the half-way line in a reserve match and when asked why he did it, said to him “I didn’t want to embarrass the keeper by scoring.” \nHe had a story for every occasion. And most of them you could learn from. \nNot only did he tell a great story, but he was one of those rare people who seemed genuinely interested when you spoke to him too. He would ask questions. He would listen to answers. He wouldn’t judge, but he may give you an opinion. Read More Graham Taylor's career in pictures - a look back the former England manager's time in football \nThis is a man who was not only a great manager, and a great man, but one that always wanted to help. He came back to Watford not just as a manager for a second time, but when the club really needed him he also came back as Chairman. \nHe was the most influential person in my life even from afar. He was part of my family, the family of tens of thousands of Watford supporters and, as I discovered today, Villa supporters too. \nGoodbye Mr. Taylor. Thank you for the memories. You will be missed.
