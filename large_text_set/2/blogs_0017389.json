The memo on internal enforcement specifically states that the one active executive amnesty program implemented under President Obama, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), is not affected by President Trump’s executive order. \nOn the campaign trail President Trump pledged to get rid of President Obama’s amnesty for illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, however, he has yet to fulfill this goal. “DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me,” the president said during a press conference last week. He added, “It’s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.” \nOver 1.5 million illegal immigrants have received protection from deportation, work permits, a social security number, and access to welfare since the implementation of DACA in 2012. While Trump has not gotten rid of DACA, the memos released Tuesday fulfill several of Trump’s campaign promises. \nNotably one of the two memos states, “A wall along the southern border is necessary to deter and prevent the illegal entry of aliens and is a critical component of the President’s overall border security strategy.” The memo orders Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to use materials originating in the U.S. to “immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall, including the attendant lighting, technology (including sensors), as well as patrol and access roads, along the land border with Mexico in accordance with existing law.” \nThe memos also order the hiring of an additional 10,000 ICE officers and 5,000 CBP officers, get rid of an Obama administration program which forced ICE to focus on deporting only the most serious of criminals, and reinstates the 287(g) program which allows for local and state law enforcement officials to enforce federal immigration law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:39:06.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
