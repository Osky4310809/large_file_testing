(Who knows? One of them could end up being the next atheist member of Congress.) \nYou can contribute by going to this spreadsheet and filling out the basic information for anyone who might qualify. I’ve filled in the names of everyone who comes to my mind. \nJust to be clear, people like former Reps. Pete Stark and Barney Frank wouldn’t make the cut since they’re no longer in office. And Rep. Kyrsten Sinema , who’s thought to be non-theistic, also wouldn’t be included since she doesn’t discuss her religious views publicly. Ditto with Rep. Jamie Raskin , who says he’s Jewish (and doesn’t use the atheist label) regardless of his religious views. \nWe’re only looking for out and proud non-religious politicians. \nThanks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T01:06:14.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
