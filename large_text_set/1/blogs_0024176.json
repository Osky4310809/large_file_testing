He’ll join the Los Angeles Rams coaching staff. \nHe was a defensive quality control coach for the San Diego Chargers for the last two NFL seasons. His grandfather, Don, is the winningest coach in NFL history. His father, David, was the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals from 1992 until 1996. Source tells @sn_nfl that Chris Shula – @DonShula grandson – hired to @RamsNFL staff (likely defense). College teammate of new HC Sean McVay \n— Alex Marvez (@alexmarvez) January 28, 2017 \nAlex Marvez from Sporting News assumed that Shula will be on the defensive side of the ball. Shula was the defensive coordinator for John Carroll University. \nHe has also served as a linebackers coach (Ball State) and defensive backs coach. The Rams need defensive backs coaches after losing Dennard Wilson, Blake Williams and (most likely) Brandon Fisher from last season. \nBoth Williams and Fisher are the sons of former NFL head coaches, so Shula would follow in that lineage.
