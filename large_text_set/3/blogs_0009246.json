But, hey — they are off to a good start after this weekend!! \nThe flick had been expected to earn about $50 million tops this week, so the fact that it has cracked $60 million on the domestic side is a big deal — and bodes well for the immediate future for this movie, as well as the coming franchise sequels. \nNow, after Logan in the second spot (that film took in $37.9 million on its second weekend), Jordan Peele is still winning at the box office with a $21 million total in Get Out 's third weekend in theaters. That brings the film up above the $100 million mark, to $111.1 million, though Sunday. \nAnd remember — Get Out cost just $5 million to make. \nNot a bad investment at all… \nWhat'd U see in theaters this weekend, Perezcious readers?! \nAnything fun??
