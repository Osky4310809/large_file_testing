Always hysterical. No douchier move on the planet than a “do you know who I am?” and that’s if you’re some A-list celebrity or major sports superstar, let alone Reuben Foster from Alabama at the NFL Combine. \n\nAnother league source said there was a “miscommunication” that allowed the argument between Foster and a hospital worker to escalate. \nFoster had been waiting for an extended period for what the NFL calls his “pre-exam,” when he grew increasingly impatient and began questioning a hospital worker. \nThe hospital worker did not take kindly to Foster’s words, and eventually the two were face-to-face, in a heated exchange. \n\nTwo favorite parts – the hospital dude saying “Do it.” Bad. Ass. That’s the response of a guy who has dealt with WAY too much bitching and moaning for 6 hour wait times. \nOther favorite – \nBut one league source said the league has to review the procedures and create better communication so that players understand what is happening and why there are delays. \n\nI mean…the dude had to wait a long time at the hospital. Welcome to being…someone who has to go to the hospital. Don’t really think you need to “review communication procedures to help players understand why there are delays,” you can just tell them to stop being such impatient entitled assholes and realize this is what a fucking hospital experience is like. \n\nFoster sent out an email to all 16 teams that were looking at him apologizing – \n\n“As you know, a decision was made by the NFL to send Reuben Foster home early from the Combine because of an incident that occurred at the hospital in Indianapolis on Friday, March 3. As a result of that decision, Reuben missed interviews that had been scheduled with 16 teams. \n“Reuben emailed each of those 16 teams to apologize for missing his scheduled interview with them, and to inform them that he will be available to answer any questions they may have about what happened at the hospital on Tuesday evening between 5:00 pm and 8:00 pm in the Linebacker meeting room at the University of Alabama football offices. \n“We are sending this email out to all teams to make sure that everyone is aware of Reuben’s availability on Tuesday evening to discuss the incident, as well as any other questions you may have for him. \n“If you have any other questions, please contact us. Thank you.” [ PFT ] Kmarko |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T17:13:37.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
