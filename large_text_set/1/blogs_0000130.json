Many have brought harrowing accounts of rape, murder and arson at the hands of Myanmar's security forces.\nTheir stories have raised global alarm and galvanised protests against Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been accused of not doing enough to help the Rohingya.\nHer government has said troops are hunting militants behind deadly raids on police border posts, denying claims of atrocities and launching a dogged information campaign against reports of abuse.\nHowever, on Monday authorities pledged to take action \"against police who allegedly beat villagers during area clearance operations on 5 November in Kotankauk village\" in a statement carried in state media.\nDozens of videos have emerged apparently showing security forces abusing Rohingya, but this is the first time the government has said it will take action over them.\nThe footage shows police hitting a young boy around the head as he walks to where dozens of villagers are lined up in rows seated on the ground, hands behind their heads.\nThree officers in uniform then start attacking one of the sitting men, beating him with a stick and kicking him repeatedly in the face.\nThe video is filmed 'selfie-style' by an officer, named as constable Zaw Myo Htike by state media, which said he recorded it during \"clearance operations\" in Kotankauk village.\nA Rohingya activist contacted by AFP said the footage had been verified by a refugee from the nearby camp, Shilkhali.\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar has long discriminated against the stateless Rohingya, who rights groups say are among the most persecuted peoples in the world.\nMore than 120,000 have been trapped in squalid displacement camps since violence erupted in 2012 in Rakhine, where they are denied citizenship, access to healthcare and education.\nMore than a dozen Nobel laureates wrote to the UN Security Council last week urging action to stop the \"human tragedy amounting to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\" in northern Rakhine.\nUnder Myanmar's junta-era constitution Suu Kyi's civilian administration has limited power over the army, which maintains control of the defence, home and border ministries.\nTopics:  MYANMAR ROHINGYA More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4PfK Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T09:36:23.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
