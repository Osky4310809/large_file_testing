I met the surgeons who worked relentlessly to try and save lives and the Tube and bus workers who made sure the system was up and running the following morning. Again this week I was proud of this city and its public servants. \nTragically, one of these public servants, PC Keith Palmer, a Metropolitan Police officer was among those killed this week as he did his duty in protecting us. He was 48 and a husband and father. \nWhen deciding on our response to the bombings in 2005, central to our thoughts was that a key objective of the terrorists was to cause an anti-Muslim backlash and that was always a risk. \nYet perhaps the most wonderful thing about London's response was that we were not aware of any single incident of violence or abuse being directed against the city's Muslims. Londoners' response was watched around the world and in the weeks that followed, tourism numbers went up and people still continued to come to London to make it their home. \nThat day of tragedy and its afternath showed London at its finest. Londoners recognised what these terrorists wanted to do was to tear us apart, in order to unleash a wave of hatred, antagonism and violence. We didn't allow the terrorists to divide us. \nAnd that's how we have to respond today - the Muslims that live in London, who have become Londoners, are not responsible for what has happened here. \nThe fact that last May, with all the attempts to whip up Islamophobia, the people of London voted for a Muslim Mayor shows that we are a great city that finds strength in its diversity. We are one London. We are not going to be divided by the terrorists. We've got to make certain that terrorist attacks - whether it is an international terrorist organisation or an angry young man - cannot divide us. We have to be united. \nAs Sadiq Khan said this week,\" Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism. We stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. We always have, and we always will.\" \nUntil the day I die, I will always be proud to have been mayor of this wonderful city and its people Follow Ken Livingstone on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ken4london More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T18:11:49.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
