In the first instance, screening for GHB by toxicologists investigating a death needs to be standard.\n“I had a meeting with Public Health England a few weeks ago and we were saying this,” said Hockenhull. “Ideally we would look for every drug in every case but there isn’t the funding available from coroners. We haven’t got the capacity to look for every drug so we do have to target what we do. But just the awareness that it is a problem [would help].”\nHer study also includes calls for greater understanding of the fatal consequences of GHB. “Further studies are thus urgently required to better understand the extent of GHB use, the prevalence in other major urban areas worldwide and the full extent of its harmful consequences.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T19:25:28.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
