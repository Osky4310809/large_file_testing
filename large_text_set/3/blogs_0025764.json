Heavy drinkers, however, had a lower risk of experiencing a myocardial infarction (0.88, 0.79 to 1.00) and stable angina (0.93, 0.86 to 1.00) as their first cardiovascular disease (fig 3 ⇑ ). Former drinkers had an augmented risk of unstable angina (hazard ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.55), myocardial infarction (1.31, 1.18 to 1.46), unheralded coronary death (1.40, 1.06 to 1.83), heart failure (1.40, 1.22 to 1.60), and cardiac arrest/sudden coronary death (1.37, 1.12 to 1.67) (fig 3 ⇑ ) and ischaemic stroke (1.16, 1.00 to 1.35), transient ischaemic attack (1.16, 0.99 to 1.37), peripheral arterial disease (1.32, 1.12 to 1.57), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (1.23, 0.99 to 1.52) (fig 4 ⇑ ) being their initial cardiovascular disease presentation. Occasional drinkers had an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.23), unheralded coronary death (1.13, 0.99 to 1.29), and heart failure (1.19, 1.11 to 1.27) (fig 3 ⇑ ) and peripheral arterial disease (1.11, 1.01 to 1.21) (fig 4 ⇑ ). We present findings for non-cardiovascular disease death (as well as coronary heart disease and stroke, not otherwise specified) in fig F in the appendix. All other categories of drinking were associated with an increased risk of non-cardiovascular disease mortality compared with moderate drinkers. We found no significant heterogeneity in the association with alcohol consumption across subtypes of myocardial infarction (fig F in appendix). There was, however, evidence of significant heterogeneity in the initial presentation of cardiovascular diseases within the categories of non-drinking and heavy drinking (table D in appendix). Effect modification by sex We found some evidence that the association between alcohol consumption and heart failure and non-cardiovascular disease mortality differed by sex (see table E and figs I and J in the appendix). Specifically, among women we observed no increased risk between heavy drinking and heart failure and an attenuated, although still increased, risk in women who did not drink compared with moderate drinkers. Sensitivity analyses Findings of sensitivity analyses are in the appendix. Interpretation did not change substantially when we adjusted only for age and sex (fig G) or after additional adjustment for systolic blood pressure, BMI, diabetes mellitus, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, use of anti-hypertensive drugs or statins, and whether then patient had received dietary advice (fig H). Similar associations were observed when we restricted analyses to endpoints determined with secondary care and mortality data sources (fig K), as well as fatal events only (fig L). There were no notable differences in the associations we observed when we used data only from 2004 onwards (fig M). Our findings when we used complete case methods were broadly concordant with those obtained using multiple imputation (fig N). Post hoc analyses Estimates from post hoc analyses within subgroups defined by smoking status (figs O and P) and BMI (figs Q, R, S) are also presented in the appendix. Our interpretation was not materially altered when we limited analyses to any specific subgroup. It is worth noting that as these analyses were restricted to observed data out of necessity, statistical power was noticeably reduced, and, while there were some differences between the point estimates in subgroups for certain endpoints (often rarer events), the confidence intervals often overlapped and included the point estimates (fig 3 ⇑ ). 41 Suggestive differences included that the lower risk of myocardial infarction in heavy drinkers was attenuated in current smokers (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.08) and those with a BMI in the normal range (1.00, 0.79 to 1.27). Non-drinking was not associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrest/sudden coronary death or abdominal aortic aneurysm in never smokers and those considered obese. Discussion In this population based cohort study of a large scale contemporary clinical sample we found considerable heterogeneity in the association between recorded alcohol consumption and the initial presentation of 12 cardiovascular diseases. Our findings for aggregated endpoints are in line with those of previous observational studies, 42 43 showing that there is an increased risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and all cause mortality in the group of non-drinkers from whom former and occasional drinkers have been removed. At the same time, compared with moderate drinkers, heavy drinkers have an increased risk of experiencing all but coronary heart disease. This lends further support to the validity of using routinely collected clinical data on alcohol consumption in research and risk prediction algorithms. Novel associations and improved resolution for association between alcohol consumption and specific cardiovascular diseases Our finding that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of initially presenting with a range of cardiovascular diseases is consistent with results of previous smaller studies (see table A). We extend this earlier work in clarifying that the protective effect observed for moderate drinking and major clinical outcomes such as myocardial infarction, 43 ischaemic stroke, 44 sudden coronary death, 45 46 heart failure, 47 peripheral arterial disease, 48 and abdominal aortic aneurysm 49 is present even after separation of the group of current non-drinkers into more specific categories. Unlike others, 50 we found no evidence of a protective effect of moderate drinking for subarachnoid haemorrhage, but we observed an increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage among heavy drinkers, which is consistent with reports elsewhere. 51 52 Other studies have also shown protective effects of alcohol consumption, even at heavy levels, for myocardial infarction. 43 53 In most outcomes for which we found a protective effect of moderate drinking, the risk of initially presenting with that endpoint was higher in former drinkers, which is consistent with the “sick quitter” hypothesis, although we still observed excess risk among non-drinkers. 10 13 To our knowledge, we have provided the first set of analyses examining the association between alcohol intake and subcategories of myocardial infarction, finding no heterogeneity across subtypes of ST elevation, non-ST elevation, and myocardial infarction not otherwise specified. This is also the first study to explore the association between not drinking and transient ischaemic attack. 54 There was no difference in risk between non-drinking and occasional drinking groups compared with those with a moderate alcohol intake. Moderate drinking, however, was associated with a lower risk of initially presenting with stable angina in contrast with non-drinking . 55 56 Furthermore, we report the first findings for alcohol consumption and unheralded coronary death, an outcome of major importance to public health, showing that both non-drinkers and heavy drinkers were more likely than moderate drinkers to present with coronary death with no previous symptomatic presentations. We are also the first to show that heavy drinkers are more likely to initially present with peripheral arterial disease 55 and fill in a current gap in the evidence base by showing no association between heavy drinking and the initial presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm. 49 Sex differences in association between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular diseases We observed few associations that differed in their magnitude by sex, which is consistent with a recent meta-analysis for aggregated cardiovascular disease. 57 We extend this to multiple cardiovascular disease phenotypes (except heart failure, for which there was a significant sex difference). Strengths: high resolution of exposure and endpoints in a contemporary clinical cohort One of the primary strengths of our study is its large size, which allowed us to examine risk of multiple cardiovascular diseases within the same sample, some of which are too rare to reliably investigate in smaller studies. Use of data from several electronic health record databases further improved the validity of our cardiovascular disease endpoints. 33 Furthermore, we attempted to stratify the group of current non-drinkers into non-drinkers and former and occasional drinkers to clarify whether the observed protective effects of moderate drinking were present when these groups were separated from each other. Another strength of our use of a contemporary cohort is that our exposure variable reflects the drinking habits encountered by health workers in present day clinical practice, whereas the information used in consented cohort studies often echoes drinking behaviour prevalent 15-20 years or more ago. This strength also carries over to other behaviours and clinical practice. Limitations Of course, our study is not without limitations. For example, our categories of drinking were based not only on self reported alcohol intake as reported by patients to their general practitioner or practice nurse but also our own judgement as how best to combine the recorded codes. Self reported measures of drinking have been criticised, 58 and it is likely that a certain degree of misclassification bias is present in our drinking categories—for example, some of the occasional drinkers were probably regular/moderate drinkers while some moderate drinkers were likely to be heavy drinkers. Therefore, the heavy drinkers in our study could represent the more extreme end of the drinking spectrum. Furthermore, no standard questions about drinking were used by all health professionals during the study period, meaning that their own personal biases might have resulted in further misclassification 59 —for example, whether they consume alcohol or not. Individuals might respond more honestly when recording their alcohol consumption on a paper questionnaire than directly to a medical professional (differential reporting by sex, fear of being judged, etc), but there was no way to quantify what proportion of data were collected by either method. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the information on alcohol consumption we used is intrinsically relevant to clinical practice as it was gathered as part of routine care and is therefore the sort of information on which clinicians will base their subsequent advice and/or treatment of patients in day to day clinical practice. Additionally, it has been standard practice in every meta-analysis of alcohol consumption and aggregated cardiovascular disease (plus other diseases) to date to combine data collected using different methods, and we do not consider our approach any more inherently biased than that. We also carried out a series of analyses linking the categories of drinking we used in this study to multiple cardiovascular traits, and they behaved as expected indicating acceptable validity of our approach. We were unable to account for differences in risk by beverage type, though findings in this area are largely mixed, 43 60 61 and it has been argued that beverage specific effects are more often a result of residual confounding by socioeconomic position 62 than true effects. Furthermore, we were unable to account for the impact of drinking pattern 4 43 63 or changes in drinking over time 64 65 66 67 on different cardiovascular outcomes. Frequency of consumption is an important omission as it is known that most people do not spread their drinking equally across the week and even isolated episodes of heavy drinking are enough to eliminate the protective effects observed for coronary heart disease in otherwise moderate drinkers. 4 63 We also did not explicitly seek to determine “thresholds” of drinking associated with the lowest risk of harm, instead we used existing clinically recorded data on alcohol consumption to examine for the first time at large scale and within the same study the association between broadly defined categories of drinking (with an emphasis placed on separating different non-drinking groups) and the initial presentation of a range of pathologically diverse cardiovascular diseases. After we have shown that heterogeneous associations exist across cardiovascular endpoints, a logical next step forward would be to more thoroughly investigate the shape of the dose-response association using continuous measures of alcohol consumption. Furthermore, our thorough examination of alcohol consumption recorded in electronic health records has additional clinical implications in having highlighted areas in which measurement of alcohol could be improved in clinical practice (such as drinking pattern). While we examined a range of cardiovascular diseases, we were unable to resolve some specific subtypes—for example, thrombotic versus embolic ischaemic stroke. This means that an even greater degree of heterogeneity could be present across subtypes of disease. While we tried to minimise measurement error in the group of non-drinkers by using a patient’s entire clinical history to define them as former drinkers if they had any record of drinking, it is likely that this approach did not capture all former drinkers. As such it is possible that the increased risk of initially presenting with several cardiovascular diseases in non-drinkers is partly caused by drinking category contamination/existing comorbidities (for example, we found that non-drinkers were more likely to have diabetes or be obese). Finally, as with all observational studies, we were unable to exclude residual confounding—for example, we did not have information on amount of tobacco smoked (as well as other smoking related traits such as age at initiation, pattern/duration of smoking, and exposure to secondhand smoke), dietary habits, or level of physical activity as these are lacking in the pre-existing electronic databases we used. By assessing the relatively negligible changes in the magnitude of the effect estimates observed for alcohol and aggregated coronary heart disease, 63 ischaemic stroke, 68 and myocardial infarction, 43 pre- and post-adjustment for dietary components and physical activity in large studies to date, however, we are somewhat confident that even if we were able to adjust for these factors, our overall conclusions would not materially change. Clinical and public health implications As noted previously, there is growing belief that the cardiovascular benefits of moderate drinking might have been overestimated, 10 including in a recent large scale Mendelian randomisation study 69 that found no protective effects of moderate alcohol intake for aggregate cardiovascular disease (though there have been some critical commentaries of this study 70 71 ). A sister paper from the Alcohol- ADH1B consortium, however, found evidence for non-linear associations between alcohol intake and some cardiovascular disease traits, including non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol, BMI, waist circumference, and C reactive protein. 72 We would expect these associations to then translate into greater heterogeneity of association with specific cardiovascular disease endpoints as seen here, underlying the importance of greater granularity in endpoint specification. The main clinical implications stemming from our findings are concerned with primary prevention and personalised risk. For example, if a patient reports heavy drinking they can be informed that if they continue to do so they have an increased risk of initial presentation withischaemic stroke, heart failure, cardiac arrest, transient ischaemic attack, intracerebral haemorrhage, or peripheral arterial disease, as well coronary death with no previous symptoms. These findings could have further translational value in an era whereby risk prediction algorithms are being developed and/or improved for specific cardiovascular disease phenotypes through having shown that the association with alcohol consumption is not common across diseases. Similarly, having shown that data on clinically recorded alcohol consumption can be validly used in research settings, in the future such information could be incorporated in disease specific risk prediction algorithms nested in clinical practice. While we did find that heavy drinkers had a lower risk of presenting with a myocardial infarction, this needs to be considered within the context of our study, which was focused on initial presentation. This does not mean that heavy drinkers will not go on to experience a myocardial infarction in the future, just that they were less likely to present with this as their first diagnosis compared with moderate drinkers. Furthermore, heavy drinkers were more likely to initially present with death from causes other than cardiovascular disease, meaning it is possible that they are less likely to initially present with any cardiovascular disease because they die from other causes before they are able to develop a cardiovascular disease. Similarly, while we found that moderate drinkers were less likely to initially present with several cardiovascular diseases than non-drinkers, it could be argued that it would be unwise to encourage individuals to take up drinking as a means of lowering their risk (although it must be noted that the findings from this study do not directly support this as we did not consider transitions from non-drinking to drinking). This is because there are arguably safer and more effective ways of reducing cardiovascular risk, such as increasing physical activity 73 74 and smoking cessation, 75 which do not incur increased risks of alcohol related harm such as alcohol dependence, liver disease, and cancer. 76 77 78 It is also worth bearing in mind that our focus was on risk of initial presentation with one cardiovascular disease rather than another, not absolute risk of cardiovascular disease. Ultimately an individual’s decision to drink should not be considered in isolation from other health behaviours or risk factors and instead be motivated by their own personal circumstances. Finally, from a public health perspective, our finding that moderate drinking is not universally associated with a lower risk of all cardiovascular conditions also supports the decision not to incorporate the apparent protective effects of drinking for cardiovascular disease in the recent UK chief medical officers’ alcohol guidelines review. 76 Conclusions Collectively, our findings, from the most comprehensive study to date of the relation between alcohol consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease, indicate that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of initially presenting with several, but not all, cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, we show that heavy drinking is differentially associated with a range of such diseases. This has implications for patient counselling, public health communication, and disease prediction algorithms and suggests the necessity for a more nuanced approach to the role of alcohol consumption in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. What is already known on this topic Moderate alcohol consumption is thought to be associated with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared with abstinence or heavy drinking. There are ongoing debates about the role of combining different types of current non-drinkers in producing this apparent protective effect. Specifically, former or occasional drinkers might have reduced or ceased drinking because of ill health, making the aggregated non-drinking group artificially seem to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality Less is known about the role of alcohol consumption in the aetiology of specific cardiovascular diseases; where studies exist they are often few in number, small in size, have combined different types of non-drinkers, and have not excluded all forms of cardiovascular disease before the primary event What this study adds This large scale study of 1.93 million adults without cardiovascular disease at baseline showed that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk of initial presentation with several, but not all, cardiovascular diseases, even after separation of groups of non-drinkers Though higher levels of alcohol intake are associated with a lower risk of initial presentation with myocardial infarction, this is offset by heavier drinkers having a greater risk of initially presenting with several other cardiovascular diseases as well as mortality from non-cardiovascular causes Data on clinically recorded alcohol consumption can be validly used in research and practice Footnotes Contributors: SB and HH conceived the research question with additional input from MD, ER, AB, and MB.
