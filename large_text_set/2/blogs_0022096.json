File photo \nILOILO CITY, Philippines â€“ A 47-year-old mother died protecting her son and nephew after two tires snapped from a passing truck in New Lucena town Tuesday. \nVerly Solinap, according to witnesses, was picking up her six-year-old son and three-year-old nephew from school when she noticed the dislodged tires, forcing her to cover the two with her body. \nSome residents brought the victims to West Visayas State University Medical Center in Iloilo City where Solinap was declared dead on arrival. Her nephew sustained minor abrasions while her son was said to be unharmed. \nInspector Rewel Pablico, New Lucena police chief, said driver Elmer Blancaflor was not aware that his truck was missing two tires. \nBlancaflor said it was only at the garage, about 15 kilometers away, that he realized something was missing, prompting him to retrace his route. Pursuing policemen arrested him along the way and charged him with reckless imprudence resulting in homicide.
