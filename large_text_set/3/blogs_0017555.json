PHOTO: Thomas Gasienica/Getty Creative \nYou might want to reconsider that order of edamame —because it might just be contaminated with a dangerous bacteria. \nEdamame in 33 states across the U.S. has just been recalled and removed from stores due to potential listeria contamination, according to the FDA . The bacteria, officially known as Listeria monocytogenes , can cause short-term symptoms, such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea in healthy individuals. However, it can be much more serious and potentially deadly in young children, frail or older adults, and those with weakened immune systems. It is also particularly dangerous to pregnant women and is known to cause miscarriages, stillbirths, and fetal infections. \nThe contamination was discovered during a random quality testing of Advanced Fresh Concepts Franchise Corp. in Rancho Dominguez, California. It affects refrigerated, packaged edamame labeled \"Edamame—Soybeans in Pods\", dated between 01/03/2017 and 03/17/2017, and sold in the following states: AL, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, FL, GA, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, ME, MI, MN, MS, NC, NH, NM, NY, OH, OR, PA, SC, TN, TX, VA, WA, and WY. \nNo illnesses from the potential contamination have been reported, but the FDA suggests that consumers in the affected states check with their store of purchase to find out if the edamame purchased falls under the recall. If it does, you should not consume it and can return it for a full refund. However, even if you haven't purchased edamame recently, it would still be wise to be exercise caution if you live in one of the states listed above—as the at-risk beans were also sold to cafeterias and corporate dining centers.
