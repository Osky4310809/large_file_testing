It's so private that from the outside, there are no signs that it exists. On the road, there's simply a nondescript gate. Apart from the fact that it's manned by a security guard, it gives nothing away, no hint of what lies beyond it. However, inside the gate is a 24 acre paradise where nature is nurtured. There are three breathtakingly beautiful villas on the property, each with their own distinct character blending chic and traditional elements. Two of them have a swimming pool. Lavish European, French, Thai and Goan meals are prepared by the in-house cooks. Aldona is situated 30 minutes inland from Panjim, in the north Goa hinterland. Rooms: 12 rooms in total. The largest villa has five bedrooms. The other two villas have four and three bedrooms each. Cost: From 11,500 rupees per room, per night. Rates for a whole villa start from 35,000 rupees per night. \ncontinue reading below our video Tips for Taking Better Travel Photos Back patio. Turiya Villa. 2.
