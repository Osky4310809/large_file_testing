According to Space10, \"The overlapping slices ensure that water and light can reach the vegetation on each level, without reaching the visitor within and thereby functions as a growth activator for the vegetation and shelter for the visitor.\"\nSpace10 explains that it doesn't make much sense to start shipping food grown in The Growroom overseas when they're trying to promote local food production. So, the design created by Sine Lindholm and Mads-Ulrik Husum is now available to the public so everyone can build their very own Growroom.\nImage: Alona vibe/space10\nHowever, if you've ever tried to build an IKEA desk in the past, building this garden may take a bit more work. The 17-step instructions can be found here , but you'll also need 17 sheets of plywood, a CNC machine, a table saw, two hammers, a screwdriver, these downloadable cutting files , your local fab lab and tons of patience.\nPieces needed to build your own Growroom\nImage: Niklas Vindelev/space10\nAlthough The Growroom might seem difficult to build, the result is totally worth it. Be prepared to enjoy your very own oasis in the heart of your city.\nImage: Alona vibe/space10\nBONUS: Ikea designed a refugee shelter and it lasts 6x longer than traditional emergency tents", "external_links": ["http://madsulrikhusum.com/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jHqtkxAtTBJqTVbt3GvOk2UswHo=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390109%2F4fd22946-079b-4293-9086-f546a859649c.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sZkBt1I20VJLNwrvBwA633qwOLg=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390086%2Fd1de01a1-dfa8-432b-9c63-d7d85ac777f6.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab", "https://www.space10.io/about", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/1lZaZj3e.m3u8", "https://www.space10.io/journal/space10-open-sources-the-growroom", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/k930g9OyfRdiFT7U7UotMbVvGFc=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390058%2F4f98b9cf-8922-46fb-9835-5f169207e5e2.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQnN-fojfE2/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dd1v2uooid_tC8QlJ_4CQUqrV-o=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390058%2F4f98b9cf-8922-46fb-9835-5f169207e5e2.jpg", "http://www.sinelindholm.com/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VEvc4ubrpk4b2QK8CGCzbpH2p9A=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390086%2Fd1de01a1-dfa8-432b-9c63-d7d85ac777f6.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/a5rsBNpPWzsHD9m5_RORs5RBLvY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390109%2F4fd22946-079b-4293-9086-f546a859649c.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tRP43KmQ4JlajG-y2-YUcf2jm6g=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390097%2Fae3fd67d-7d1c-4bac-9f3c-b17b5ce81bdf.jpeg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/j64wnFd_OIFHRU-pU54dPCBLpD8=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390097%2Fae3fd67d-7d1c-4bac-9f3c-b17b5ce81bdf.jpeg", "https://github.com/space10-community/the-growroom", "https://medium.com/space10-the-farm/space10-open-sources-the-growroom-aa7ca6621715#.aygbyy67u", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/1lZaZj3e.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-21T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:56:07.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
