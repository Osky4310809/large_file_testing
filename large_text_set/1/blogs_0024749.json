Ken Salazar, right, introduces Neil Gorsuch at his nomination hearing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit on June 21, 2006. Gorsuch is being considered as a possibly replacement for the late U.S. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia. \nPresident Donald Trump is on the verge of making his most enduring appointment to date and we are encouraged by one of the names on his list to replace former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. \nNeil Gorsuch is a federal judge in Denver with Western roots and a reputation of being a brilliant legal mind and talented writer. Those who have followed Gorsuch’s career say that from his bench in the U.S. 10th Circuit Court Court of Appeals he has applied the law fairly and consistently, even issuing provocative challenges to the Supreme Court to consider his rulings. \nLiberals who dreamed of a less-conservative Merrick Garland on the court will undoubtedly gasp at a suggestion that Gorsuch would be a good addition to a court that has been shorthanded for more than a year. \nGorsuch is most widely known for ruling in the Hobby Lobby contraception case before it reached the Supreme Court in 2014. His controversial decision was upheld in a 5-4 vote. Gorsuch wrote in the case that those with “sincerely held religious beliefs” should not be forced to participate in something “their religion teaches them to be gravely wrong.” \nWe disagreed with that ruling, saying the Supreme Court wrongly applied constitutional protections of religious freedom to a corporation that remained owned by a small group of like-minded individuals. \nWe argued that even closely held corporations — primarily functioning as money-making entities and not religious institutions — shouldn’t be able to opt out of the Affordable Care Act mandate that insurance cover contraception by citing First Amendment protections intended for individuals and churches. \nBut in considering Gorsuch’s body of work and reputation — and yes, we like his ties to Colorado as well — we hope Trump gives him the nod. \nWe are not afraid of a judge who strictly interprets the Constitution based solely on the language and intent of our nation’s founders, as long as he is willing to be consistent even when those rulings conflict with his own beliefs. \nAs Denver Attorney Jason Dunn, who considers himself a longtime fan of Gorsuch, explains, his views stem “from a belief in a separation of powers and in a judicial modesty that it is not in the role of the courts to make law. Justice Scalia would put it: If you like every one of your rulings, you’re probably doing it wrong.” \nA justice who does his best to interpret the Constitution or statute and apply the law of the land without prejudice could go far to restore faith in the highest court of the land. That faith has wavered under the manufactured and false rhetoric from critics that the high court has become a corrupt body stacked with liberals. And while Democrats will surely be tempted to criticize the nomination of anyone Trump appoints, they’d be wise to take the high road and look at qualifications and legal consistency rather than political leanings. \nGorsuch, at 49, will have years to whittle away at that damaging lack of trust. A July 2016 Gallup Poll found that 52 percent of Americans disapproved of the way the Supreme Court handled its job. The finding is striking, considering the same poll in 2000 found only 29 percent of Americans disapproved. \nWe could do far worse than a thoughtful graduate from Columbia, Harvard and Oxford universities, who clerked for two Supreme Court justices and calls Denver home. \nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.
