Honoring a detainer request is not about politics, it is about keeping New York citizens safe,” Thomas Decker, field office director for Enforcement and Removal in New York, said in a statement. \nThe mayor's office did not return an immediate request for comment. \nBut Rosemary Boeglin, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio told the Daily News that “The detainee was released after he pled guilty and served his time for an offense that does not qualify as a violent or serious felony under the city’s local laws.” \n“And his gang affiliation was not supported by evidence that meets even minimal constitutional standards. When ICE presents evidence to our city that an individual in our custody has been convicted of a violent or serious offense — one that threatens the public’s safety — we will fully cooperate.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:03:57.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
