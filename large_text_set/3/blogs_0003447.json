That can include its adherence to child labor laws, environmental policy, or good corporate governance (in most cases good governance companies also adhere to the other two policies, #justsyain). \nFor Hardeep Walia , Motif’s chief executive, the move into automated wealth management was a long time coming. \nWalia is pretty methodical in his decisionmaking around Motif and his approach to entering the robo-advisory market was no different. Before deciding to launch the new service, Walia reached out to customers via a survey to determine what was missing from the market. \nAccording to that (company-sponsored) survey, consumers really wanted an investment product that reflected their values. \n“We call this a spillover of the Trump election,” says Walia. “Roughly 83% of Americans use values when making investment decisions… And roughly 57% of Americans would be angry if they found their money was being invested in companies that are contradictory to their values.” \nFor instance, Walia says, “my gay friends would not want to know that their retirement money is being used to lobby against them. \nThat’s why Walia decided to ultimately develop the robo-investing product (it couldn’t hurt that there hasn’t been a lot of competition in that market recently, either). The thesis investment angle also aligns well with Motif’s own emphasis on letting investors make their own basket of stocks in their independent investment platform. \n\n\nCreating a new portfolio product online is as easy as choosing which “value” based investment is most important of the three, and determining your investment goals. Through the company’s mobile app (which launched late last year) a chatbot interface walks users through the creation of an investment strategy. \n\nThe other unique aspect of the Motif platform is its ability to buy into a basket of stocks, rather than just an exchange traded fund. Owning the underlying assets means that you can actually dive into your portfolio and swap out specific companies that may not suit an investor’s tastes. \n“We make everything customizable,” says Walia. The company defaults into an investment plan that claims to offer a 6.8% return, but everything from rebalancing the portfolio to changing the dividend reinvestment models can be done by a Motif investor. \n\n\n\nThe company charges a $10 fee to subscribe to its service, which, Walia argues, is better than the hidden fees associated with the basis points that most money managers charge. There are no added transaction fees. \nThe Seattle-based company currently has 320,000 retail investors on the platform right now and is partnering with Goldman Sachs, US Bank’s Ascent private wealth management platform to bring Motif’s technology to institutional investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:13:15.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
