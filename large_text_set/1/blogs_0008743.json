Dalupang (philstar.com) | Updated January 8, 2017 - 9:10pm THE MAN IN THE PROTECTIVE MASK Alex Cabagnot paced the Beermen with 16 points in a victorious outing against Barangay Ginebra, Sunday night at the Big Dome. | PBA Media Bureau \nMANILA, Philippines — San Miguel Beer kept Barangay Ginebra at bay, 72-70, to roll to their sixth straight victory in the Philippine Cup in Sunday's PBA nightcap. \nLA Tenorio had a chance to send the game to overtime but wasn't able to bury his patented floater over a the outstretched arms of Arwind Santos. \n\"I think this kind of game is what we need right now going into the next three games,\" San Miguel head coach Leo Austria said. \"We're up against GlobalPort, TNT (in the next games) ... I'm so happy with the team because they really fought hard.\" \n\"In the start, dahil it seemed na ready ang Ginebra,\" he added. \"But they refused to lose and yung mga players talagang gusto nilang manalo. We're able to recover and control the game.\" \nAlex Cabagnot — still nursing an injured nose — poured 17 points to lead San Miguel. Ronald Tubid and Arwind Santos accounted for 12 and 10 markers, respectively. \nBut Austria also rued the near-collapse that happened to his wards. Sportshub   \"'Yung last three possessions namin, we're leading by eight. Naging five. Naging two,\" he noted. \n\"Buti nalang di pumasok 'yung tira ni LA,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I knew from the start that this will be tight. The energy hasn't gone down since the last game against Blackwater.\" \nThe victory solidifies the 7-1 Beermen's place atop the Philippine Cup standings. They've been assured of a quarterfinals berth since beating Blackwater last Wednesday. \nGinebra, on the other hand, sinks to 3-4. \nThe scores: \nSAN MIGUEL 72 - Cabagnot 16, Tubid 12, Santos 10, Fajardo 9, Lassiter 7, Espinas 7, De Ocampo 5, Ross 4, Garcia 2, Heruela 0. \nGINEBRA 70 - Aguilar 17, Mercado 11, Tenorio 8, Devance 7, Ferrer 7, Thompson 6, Cruz 6, Ellis 2, Mariano 2, Marcelo 2, Caguioa 2. \nQuarters: 15-17, 32-31, 53-49, 72-70 Sportshub  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T22:09:38.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
