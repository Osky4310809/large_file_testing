The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 17,773 on Friday.\nIn a CNBC interview last week , Buffett also spoke about interest rates. \"If you had zero interest rates and you knew you were going to have them forever, stocks should sell at, you know, 100 times earnings or 200 times earnings,\" he said.\nConsider this: Near zero percent rates from December 2008 to mid-December last year helped pushed the Dow up more than 100 percent. That happened as Wall Street was waiting for the penny to drop on a hike, which finally happened Dec. 15, 2015.\nIf zero rates were a certainty for 50 years, Buffett was basically saying stocks could make a move exponentially higher, when considering how far the Dow came in just seven years.\nThe chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway was interviewed in Omaha, Nebraska, where he hosted the annual meeting of the company's shareholders on Saturday.\n‹ Buffett: Buffett to Trump: America is already greater than ever Buffett: We've 'never sold a share of IBM' and might buy more ›", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T09:20:46.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
