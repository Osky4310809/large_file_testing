More by Phil Anastasia Jan 11 \n\nThe football teams from Camden and Timber Creek high schools were scheduled to meet on the Farnham Park field in October. \nInstead, the teams plan to opt out of that game and travel to East St. Louis, Ill., to play different opponents in a showcase event over Labor Day weekend. \n\"We've been trying to do this for the last few years,\" said Frank Torcasio, athletic director of the Black Horse Pike School District, which includes Timber Creek. \"Camden thought it was a good idea, my administration's on board with it, I'm on board with it, so 'Let's do it.'\" \nCamden coach Dwayne Savage said the Panthers hope to bring their renown band, the Mighty Marching Panthers. \n\"We're hoping it's a great experience,\" Savage said. \"The only bad thing is not getting chance to play Timber Creek. That's a team that I always want to play.\" \nWest Jersey Football League president Bud Kowal, the athletic director at Ewing, confirmed that the league will allow the teams to cancel their game. \n\"As long as it's mutually agreed upon, we don't have a problem with it,\" Kowal said. \nThe tentative schedule has Timber Creek playing Belleville (Ill.) West and Camden playing Cahokia (Ill.) on the afternoon of Saturday Sept. 2. \nThe event, the Flyers Football Classic, will be hosted by East St. Louis High School, which is coached by Camden graduate Darren Sunkett. \nEast St. Louis was 15-0 last season. The host team will play Whitehaven of Tennessee in the final game of the showcase. \n\"I try to get my guys as many experiences as possible,\" Timber Creek coach Rob Hinson said. \"We're pumped up, looking forward to it.\" \nBoth teams are scheduled to travel by bus on Friday and return on Sunday. \n\"We don't have a full itinerary yet but hopefully we can find something educational or historical that we can visit while we're out there,\" Hinson said. \nBy playing on Labor Day weekend and opting out of the October game with each other, Camden and Timber Creek will have two bye weeks during the regular season, although they also would open a week earlier than most teams. \nCamden was 3-7 last season but the Panthers were a combined 28-5 in the previous three seasons. \nTimber Creek is coming off a 12-0 season capped by the team's second consecutive South Jersey Group 4 title. \n\"It's a chance to show the Midwest what South Jersey football is about,\" Hinson said. \n-- Contact Phil Anastasia at panastasia@phillynews.com \n-- Follow @PhilAnastasia on Twitter \nClick HERE to read more Jersey Side Sports posts.
