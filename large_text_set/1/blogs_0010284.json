Filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani says the first shot for Sanjay Dutt’s biopic has been taken and there is excitement among the film’s team. “First shot taken now for Sanjay Dutt’s biopic. Canning a very funny scene. Excitement in cast and crew,” Hirani, who has previously helmed blockbusters like PK, 3 Idiots and Munna Bhai M.B.B.S, tweeted on Saturday. \nActor Ranbir Kapoor , who was last seen on the big screen in filmmaker Karan Johar’s multi-starrer Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, will essay the role of Sanjay in the upcoming biopic, while Sonam Kapoor will play the lead heroine opposite him. At first glance Ranbir, looks like a total misfit to play Sanjay Dutt. Sanjay, on one hand is brawny, while Ranbir has the chocolate boy looks. But according Hirani, Ranbir is quite looking his part after some efforts. While talking to a news daily, the director said that he picked Ranbir to play the part as he had the same dopey eyes that Sanjay had during his Rocky days. He also added that after gaining weight for the role, Ranbir looks so much like Sanjay, that even the senior actor could not believe his eyes. “He has to put on a few more kilos before losing it all. The first time I saw him in get-up, I thought it was Sanju. I clicked him and sent it across to Sanju who wondered why I was sending him his own pictures,“ Hirani said. \nThe biopic will reportedly also feature Vicky Kaushal. Anushka Sharma is also said to be playing the role of a journalist, while the search for an actress to play Nargis is still on.

It’s a feel-good film about a father-son relationship with Paresh Rawal playing Sunil Dutt and Ranbir as Sanju… A buddy film with Sanju’s many friends adding up to one from the US, played by Vicky Kaushal,“ Raju said.
