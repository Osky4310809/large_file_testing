Researchers have developed a pretty mind blowing new piece of video technology that allows a person the ability to transfer their facial expressions on to another person in real-time – creating a video that looks real enough to convince almost anyone. The technology comes out of a collaborative effort between Germany’s University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics, and Stanford University in California. The incredible technology has already being tested on George W Bush, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and Vladimir Putin. The study, Face2Face: Real-time Face Capture and Reenactment of RGB Videos, “animates the facial expressions of the target video by a source actor and re-renders the manipulated output video in a photo-realistic fashion,” according to the researchers. advertisement - learn more The way the technology works can be explained simply, it tracks the facial expressions of both the source and target video and addresses details like teeth by finding the mouth interior that best matches the re-targeted expression and warping it to produce the right fit. Watch below as the technology is put into action in live demonstrations. Do you think this technology is safe to have? Given the implications of what this could be used for with the proper voice tone recreation technologies out there, couldn’t this make anyone say anything someone wanted?
