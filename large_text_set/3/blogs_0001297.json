Atletico Madrid’s forward Fernando Torres is evacuated in an ambulance due to an injury during the Spanish league football match RC Deportivo de la Coruna vs Club Atletico de Madrid at the Municipal de Riazor stadium in La Coruna on March 2, 2017.The match ended with a 1-1 draw. / AFP PHOTO \n“Our player, who is stable, conscious and oriented, had to be removed by ambulance after being stabilised according to the usual protocol, before entering the Model Hospital of La Coruna, where he will spend the night in observation.” \nPlayers from both sides immediately called for medical attention when Torres hit the ground. \nDistressed Atletico defender Jose Maria Gimenez was seen crying, whilst Deportivo fans gave the former Spanish international a standing ovation as he was carried from the field. \n“We are all scared,” Atletico left-back Filipe Luis told BeIN Sports. \n“The news we have received until now is good. The most important thing is that Fernando is ok.” \nAtletico’s Sime Vrsaljko and captain Gabi have also been praised for reacting quickly to ensure Torres didn’t swallow his tongue whilst unconscious. \nThe visitors had to play out seven minutes of stoppage time with 10 men as they had already made all three substitutions. \nFormer West Bromwich Albion manager Pepe Mel was making his bow as Deportivo coach after only being hired on Wednesday. \nAnd the hosts made the perfect start when Florin Andone capitalised on a poor goal kick from Jan Oblak to run through and slot past the Slovenian. \nAtletico responded after half-time and equalised in stunning fashion 22 minutes from time when Antoine Griezmann thrashed home a shot from fully 30 yards.
