Phillip/Associated Press Scott Polacek Featured Columnist March 14, 2017 On Monday, KWTX 10 in Waco, Texas, reported Baylor dismissed associate director for football operations DeMarkco Butler for sending inappropriate text messages to a teenager. The report noted a school official said the texts were sent to someone who was considered an adult under Texas statute. Kevin McGuire of NBC Sports confirmed the news and noted Butler was hired last month. According to KWTX 10, Butler is the second person Baylor has fired who was hired under head football coach Matt Rhule's tenure. Assistant strength coach Brandon Washington was fired following his arrest in a prostitution sting in February. Butler's dismissal is the latest chapter for a university and football program enveloped in controversy. The school shared findings of fact from law firm Pepper Hamilton's investigation in May that found Baylor did not follow Title IX legislation, failing to adequately investigate sexual assault allegations made against football players. That investigation led to the firing of then head football coach Art Briles. What's more, Jenny Dial Creech of the Houston Chronicle reported in February Baylor officials had documentation saying Briles and former athletic director Ian McCaw knew of different infractions by football players and attempted to cover them up.
