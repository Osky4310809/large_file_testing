(The company even worked with Uber to hail users a ride if their BAC level was too high.) \nAn FTC inquiry found that, despite Breathometer’s claims it sold “law enforcement grade” breathalyzers, a user’s BAC reading would frequently be off. According to the FTC , not only could Breathometer’s results be lower than someone’s actual BAC level, but that readings be affected by ambient humidity and temperature. \nIn 2015, the company announced plans for a new product called Mint that measures oral health and hydration . Breathometer says it stopped selling its breathalyzer products in early 2015, ahead of the FTC’s complaint. \nHowever, the FTC claims the devices were still available at some retailers until early 2016. In May 2016, Breathometer sent a letter to retailers and an email to registered users alerting them of the device inaccuracies, and in October last year the company disabled the breathlyzer feature altogether in its app. \nAs part of the FTC’s settlement, Breathometer has agreed to offer full refunds to all users who request them. Altogether, the FTC claims Breathometer sold $5.1 million worth of Original and Breeze devices. \nBreathometer has not replied to our request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:48:34.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
