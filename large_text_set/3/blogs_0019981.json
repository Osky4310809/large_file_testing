JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Images \nToby Alderweireld is seeking a new contract to put him in line with Tottenham ’s top earners, Harry Kane and Hugo Lloris . \nSpurs are keen to agree a deal for the centre-half after details of his current contract were leaked late last year, including a £25million release clause that would become active in summer 2019, when the Belgian will be 30. \nAlderweireld is the only key first-team player who has not signed an extension since the start of 2016 - with the exception of Victor Wanyama who has been at Spurs for just nine months. \nAlderweireld’s deal, worth about £50,000 a week, expires in two years but the club hold an option to prolong it until 2020. Spurs undecided whether to hire direct replacement for Paul Mitchell \nBoth Kane and Lloris have deals that could earn them in excess of £100,000 per week, though Spurs say their basic salaries fall within the club’s wage structure. \nRecent history suggests that player and club will find common ground. It is very rare for Spurs to allow an important to player to drift into the final 18 months of his contract. \nNegotiations for Kane, Lloris and Christian Eriksen, who signed a new deal last September, took considerable time but, in the end, chairman Daniel Levy secured the signatures of all three. Yet it is likely Alderweireld would need a substantial pay rise to re-sign.
