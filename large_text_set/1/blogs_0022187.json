The biggest names on the list come at quarterback, with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton getting the honor of filling in for New England's Tom Brady. Per Chris Brown of the Buffalo Bills' official website, Tyrod Taylor was offered a spot but will not play because of his groin injury. That left Dalton to earn his third Pro Bowl appearance despite finishing with a career-low 18 touchdown passes. His 91.8 quarterback rating was just the 15th-best in the NFL, per ESPN.com . Kirk Cousins is another interesting addition as he looks for a long-term contract with the Washington Redskins. Bleacher Report's Jason Cole reported Monday the team could also trade the quarterback to either the San Francisco 49ers or Cleveland Browns: Bleacher Report NFL @BR_NFL 1/23/2017, 8:36:55 PM Adding a Pro Bowl selection to his resume could change his outlook, or at least his price tag. Green Bay Packers offensive lineman T.J. Lang will miss the game because of a hip injury, but he made sure to congratulate teammate David Bakhtiari: TJ Lang @TJLang70 1/23/2017, 8:35:06 PM Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant earned a spot despite finishing second on his team in receiving yards (796) behind Cole Beasley (833). Bryant missed three games because of a knee injury, but his effort when he was on the field was enough to get him his third career appearance at the Pro Bowl.
