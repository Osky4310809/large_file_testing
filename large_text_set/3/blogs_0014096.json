By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 15, 2017 12:33 PM The sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s film Padmavati were torched on Tuesday night in Maharashtra. (Source: IE image) \nIn another trouble for filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the set of film Padmavati was torched last night in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur. The set was set on fire on Tuesday night around 10 pm that left the logistics in ashes. Fringe groups and local goons are believed to be behind the incident but no confirmation about this has been made so far. As per the reports by the Indian Express, about 40 to 50 people attacked the sets with stones and lathis when animals were also present inside. \nWatch the visuals from the set: #WATCH Visuals of Padmavati set vandalised by fringe group in Kolhapur, Maharashtra pic.twitter.com/C6o4C0xN6z \n— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) March 15, 2017 \nThe director had decided to shift his shooting to Maharashtra after his set was attacked and vandalised in Jaipur a couple of months ago causing a nationwide controversy. Back then, Karni Sena argued that film had a dream sequence between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji which shows the queen in a bad light. However, the production house denied these claims. Sanjay Leela Bhansali was attacked for bending the history as per his will. \nMany Bollywood celebrities came in support of the director asking for freedom of speech and artistic liberty with Sushant Singh Rajput even taking ‘Rajput’ out of his name on Twitter for one complete day. The film stars Deepika Padukone in the title role along with Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor . After facing disappointment in Jaipur, Bhansali had started shooting in Mumbai and Kolhapur. But after the attack in Kohlapur, the shooting in Mumbai has also been stopped. \nThe film was in the news earlier, when Mukesh Dakia, a painter died on the sets of Padmavati after meeting with an accident. Bhansali Productions reached out to the family and offered them a compensation of over Rs 20 lakh according to a press release by the production house.
