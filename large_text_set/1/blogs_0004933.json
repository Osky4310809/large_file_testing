Bernie Sanders is Jewish, but that doesn’t matter. ‘Like Santa, Bernie is kind of the ultimate giver. No one gets left behind. No matter your means or background, you get a visit from him. Only his gifts are the exact opposite of Santa’s consumerism-fest,’ says Marom. Her spectacle is also postapocalyptic and takes place in the year 2132: Global warming has washed away the eastern coast of the United States, and the characters have gathered for their holiday on the new shore — in Cleveland. \nChristmas is obsolete in 2132; instead the characters assemble to celebrate NotMeUs, a festival fixated on Sanders, who has returned to Earth in the form of Sanders Claus. Elders gather the children around to recount the legend of this winter celebration — the story of how our country fell into ruin after failing to heed Bernie’s warnings, but after adopting his policies returned to prosperity — and to sing carols about the decline of corporate greed. \nThe production ended with a number called “We Blew It” that goes: \nBut what a crime \nWe thought we had more time \nWe chose to shut our eyes \nWe were in for a surprise \nLocal NBC affiliate, WPTZ, also covered the performance: Brendan Gauthier is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T17:17:58.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
