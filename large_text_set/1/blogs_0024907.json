I had to check the URL so many times to be sure. … The fact that an article would never be written about moms who take their kids to dance or sports or the playground was so clear to me.\" \nAfter receiving negative feedback from readers, editors at The New York Times apologized for the article. \nThe Metro editor, Wendell Jamieson, whose section produced the piece, told The Huffington Post , \"It was a bad idea from the get-go. It was conceived with the best intentions, but it fell flat. And I regret it.\" \n\"Sorry, sorry, sorry,\" Bondy said. \nAnd, the deputy editor of the Times' Metro section, Dean Chang, had this to say: @david_andreatta @JimmyVielkind what was left behind.

I'll take the blame. — Dean Chang (@dchangnyt) January 23, 2017 \nSuch immediate and widespread criticism of the NYT article points to the fact that we are all becoming more aware of the ridiculousness of holding women and men to different standards when it comes to parenting. It shows we are moving in a positive direction where co-parenting is becoming the norm, and that we are more critical of rhetoric describing fathers as heroic simply for doing the things mothers are expected to do every day. \nIt's 2017, and we need to continue to do better. \nCover image via Unsplash", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T01:30:20.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
