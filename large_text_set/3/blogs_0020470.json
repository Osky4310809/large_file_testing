I didn't seek this job,\" Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review in an interview during his recent Asia trip. \nSo why did he take the job? As the Hill points out , when asked why he agreed to take on the position of secretary of State, Tillerson said his wife \"told me I'm supposed to do this.\" \nDuring the interview Tillerson said he had never met President Trump before the election. After his victory, the president wanted to talk with Tillerson \"about the world.\" \n“When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of State, I was stunned,\" Tillerson said. Tillerson later told his wife about the offer. \n“I told you God’s not through with you,\" he said his wife told him. The former ExxonMobil CEO added: “I was supposed to retire in March, this month. I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.\" \nTillerson also said he serves at the \"pleasure of the president.\" \n\"My wife convinced me,\" he said. \"She was right. I'm supposed to do this.\" Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of State in February, despite a late effort by Democrats to slow down the nomination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:18:00.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
