The diplomatic intervention marks the first apparent fracture in the secretive deconfliction arrangement between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over where, when and who Israeli jets can strike in Syria.

But Friday’s raid, reportedly by four Israeli jets which penetrated Syrian airspace, appears to have changed that dynamic after the interception of an SA-5 missile that flew into Israel forced it for the first time in the six-year Syrian civil war to acknowledge an attack. \nSyria’s use of anti-aircraft missiles against the Israeli jets however suggested an increased confidence in the Assad regime, which has seen a number of similar air raids by Israel. Syria’s ambassador to the UN, Bashar al-Jaafari, on Sunday insisted the Syrian response was “in line with Israel’s terrorist operation” and had “changed the rules of the game”.

Hezbollah has been violating UN resolutions and is gearing for war,” he said. \nOutside of the recent rhetoric, however, what has been fast emerging in recent months is that Israel may have badly misjudged the potential outcome of the Syrian war. \nIsrael had anticipated a conflict that would undermine the Assad regime, seriously wound Hezbollah and push back Iran’s attempts to expand its influence. But since Moscow’s intervention Assad’s forces and Hezbollah have clawed back territory from rebel groups and Islamic State, creating conditions more conducive for Iran to supply weapons to the Lebanese militants. \nBrig Gen Nitzan Nuriel, a former director of counter-terrorism in the Israeli prime minister’s bureau until 2012, said conflict with Hezbollah was inevitable as the group sought ever more advanced anti-aircraft missiles, heavy rockets and tactical weapons, but he believed Assad had seriously misread the situation. \n“Assad has not read the map correctly,” he told journalists in a telephone briefing. “He believes it is only a question of weeks or months before he can declare a full victory and is looking to the next stage. I believe he is mistaken and that clashes in Syria will stay with us for the next three to six years.” \nDiscussing Russia’s role in Syria, he added more controversially: “Russia got the messages it needs to receive from Israel.” That was, he said: “Israel will not allow anyone, including Russia to get in the way of implementing our military mission.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:00:35.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
