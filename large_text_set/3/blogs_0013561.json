He asked her: “Are you Korean?” She replied yes.\nHe left and returned a few minutes later with a hammer and bashed her in the head with it at least 20 times as she struggled to cover her face and protect her head, the surveillance footage showed.\nKaren Orellana worked just a few doors down from where the attack happened. She went outside when she heard the 24-year-old victim screaming.\nBy then, a security guard was there, and the suspect, Jae Won Yang, 22, put his hands up.\n“I think they told him to drop the hammer, and then he just dropped it. But he was acting like nothing happened,” Orellana recalled.\nA Good Samaritan also sprung into action, pinning the man down with his foot while he waited for police to arrive.\nAnother woman tended to the injured victim, who was covered in blood.\nPolice believed the suspect and victim did not know each other.\n“Our investigation did reveal that our suspect had targeted this person because she’s a female, and she was Korean,” said Capt. David Kowalski of the LAPD.\nHe is a Korean national, homeless and recently came to the U.S., according to police.\nThe victim survived but suffered serious injuries.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:46:58.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
