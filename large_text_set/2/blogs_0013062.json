The man behind the character, Josh McDermitt, is likewise a lover not a fighter, so Yahoo TV had to get his sage advice for bringing a little passion to Valentine’s Day during the end of the world. McDermitt’s most important tip to keep in mind is that you need to be a good little boy scout and plan ahead. There are no Walgreens with overstuffed shelves of plastic-wrapped chocolates or bedazzled teddy bears that caterwaul about being “a hunk of, hunk of burnin’ love.” This is the end of the world, people, and if you want to show your beloved that you mean business, you keep an eye out for that perfect gift all year long. Just pray your heart’s desire lives long enough to receive your precious find.

If that romantic walk through the rose garden has been compromised by walkers, pivot and find a secluded beach that the zombies have not yet overrun. Improvise, people! You love this person, show them that with an inventive date site, like an abandoned amusement park (they aren’t just the setting for Scooby-Doo mysteries anymore). Although this all may seem grim, as long as you keep the romance alive on this Valentine’s Day, it doesn’t matter if everyone ends up dead. “We’re all dead anyway,” McDermitt suggests. And he’s right. Especially if you don’t heed his words and bring the passion today of all days. The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:34:00.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
