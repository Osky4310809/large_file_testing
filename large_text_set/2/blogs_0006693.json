Following the mixed reception of Suicide Squad , fans have been eyeing the upcoming projects with more than their fair share of trepidation. Both fans and critics have bemoan the universe’s perpetually dark tones, but that all looks like it is about to change. Thanks to two Justice League crew members, fans have learned more about the blockbusters hopeful tone. \nRecently, Damon Caro and Bryan Hirota sat down for an interview with Heroic Hollywood where they talked about working on the DCEU. The assistant director and effects supervisor both worked on Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and have carried over to Justice League . While the two could not speak freely about the film, Caro was able to talk about the movie’s tone, and it sounds very different from anything seen in the universe to date. \n“The interesting thing is, on Man of Steel , in [ Zack Snyder ’s] head he had the storyline treatment of where they were going to go, and at the beginning of BvS it was even richer and deeper. The arc was BvS was the midway point and the darker movie. Hence what happens at the end; the whole tone of it was darker. If you play your story all at one level, there are no peaks and valleys, there’s no life. The great stories, the Greek tragedies, even life we have to be knocked down before we can build our way up,” Caro said. \n“ Justice League was always the rebirth of hope and the rise,” he continued. “People try to say that it’s a response to the backlash, and I’d definitely say that criticisms were heard, but it’s not like we threw everything out and started with a blank slate. It’s a bit like Star Wars. Empire Strikes Back? Dark movie! But then Return of the Jedi is the rise and the rebuilding of hope.” \nThe director also revealed which part of the film he thinks fans will be most receptive to. \" I’m excited for people to see all of these characters together. I can’t be more specific than that unfortunately, but that’s it. Finally getting to see the whole team together. We were on set for the shots when they first had them all together and it was incredible,\" he teased.
