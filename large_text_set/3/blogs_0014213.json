Fourteen years later, the 7-foot center admits he didn’t realize at the time how fortunate he was.\n“I could say I didn’t get a proper chance. However, that’s simply an alibi,” Milicic told a Serbian news outlet in a recent interview . “It’s up to a young player to prove himself, work hard and wait for his chance. My approach was completely different. As a No. 2 pick coming from Europe, I thought I was sent by God. So I got into fights, got drunk before practices, spiting everyone, while in the end, I was spiting myself.”\nThe Pistons went on to defeat the Lakers in the 2004 Finals, and Milicic became the youngest player ever to appear in a Finals game. But he continued to see more of the bench than the court, averaging 1.6 points per game over three years in Detroit before being spun out on a trade merry-go-round. Nowadays he blames it on a self-righteous attitude that made him a hard-partying playboy off the court and wildly unreliable on it.\nMilicic talks to Nate Robinson during a game with the Knicks in 2009. Getty Images “I had issues with everyone, and that was caused by me playing just for myself. My goal wasn’t to silence the critics, it was to silence my ego,” Milicic said. “There were some situations where I’ve already scored 20 points, but in my head I’m thinking: ‘When will this game finally end, come on, let’s pack it up and go home.’ I just had to feed my ego, I couldn’t care less what’s going to happen the following week. My whole approach since coming to the United States was just wrong.”\nMilicic and his emotional baggage made a pit stop in New York in 2009 — following a widely criticized trade with the Grizzlies for Quentin Richardson — and Milicic’s dislike for playing reached an all-time high. When Milicic requested to return to a European league six months later, the Knicks voiced their intention of sending him to the Timberwolves.\n“I met with [then-Timberwolves president] David Kahn and told him: ‘Don’t trade for me for the love of God, I don’t want to play in the NBA anymore, I’ll ruin your team. I’ll f–k up the team chemistry, do not trade for me. When it’s not working, it’s not working,'” Milicic said. “He told me to join them for two weeks, and if I’m not feeling it I’m free to leave.”\nMilicic ended up spending two begrudging years in Minnesota after signing a four-year, $20 million deal, in what would be his final, multi-year stint on an NBA team. In one last shot with the Celtics, Milicic played a total of five minutes before asking to leave for personal reasons.\n“For my whole life I’m going to be the No. 2 pick who didn’t live up to the expectations, but I am what I am,” he said. “I’m different from other busts. They wanted to, but they couldn’t, and I could when I wanted to. That’s the issue in my head, but no one wants to dig deeply into it. They just look at the stats and tell me I’ve done nothing.”\nFour-plus years removed from the NBA, a free-wheeling, heavier Milicic says he has finally found peace in a slower-paced career in his native Serbia.\n“I’ve gained 90 pounds since I stopped playing, I’m at 350 right now,” he said. “I’m working at my farm and enjoying that kind of production. I take walks through my fields and watch the process, which makes me really happy.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:38:18.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
