There were nine minutes of stoppage time at the end of the first-half. Report: Chelsea keep rolling 1:20 \nCahill quickly returned to his feet and readied himself to return to the action. He completed the game and scored Chelsea’s second goal. \n“It was a bad accident with Gary and, I must be honest, after the first half also Gary wasn’t really good,” Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said. “He decided to continue the game.
