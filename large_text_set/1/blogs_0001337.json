The company says that the new Galaxy A (2017) series is stylish, powerful and practical with features that will make users’ everyday lives a bit more easier. Samsung will be launching the 4.3-inch Galaxy A3 and the 5.2-inch Galaxy A5 (2017) in Europe, in Black Sky, Gold Sand, Blue Mist and Peach Cloud color options. \nThe new Galaxy A (2017) series handsets have a metal frame and 3D glass back that clearly takes inspiration from the design of Samsung’s more premium offerings like the Galaxy S7. This is combined with a sleek camera and home button to provide a seamless form factor that’s comfortable to hold and use. For the first time, the Galaxy A series now offers IP68 water and dust resistance as well. Additional features include a USB Type-C port, Fast Charging, and Always on Display. \nSamsung has significantly improved the imaging capabilities of the new handsets, including putting a 16-megapixel sensor on the front. A floating shutter lets users easily take a selfie by tapping anywhere on the screen and they can also use the display as a front flash for bright pictures. The camera UX has been simplified to allow users to quickly change modes and instantly add filters. \nThe Galaxy A5 (2017) features a 5.2-inch full HD Super AMOLED display with a 1.9GHz octa-core processor under the hood. The handset has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, a 16-megapixel front and rear camera, 3,000mAh battery with Fast Charging support and Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. The Galaxy A7 (2017) will feature similar specs as the A5 (2017), except for a larger battery (3,300 mAh) and a bigger display (5.7 inches). The Galaxy A3 (2017) has a 4.7-inch HD Super AMOLED display with a 1.6GHz octa-core processor, 2GB RAM and 16GB storage, a 13-megapixel rear and 8-megapixel front camera, a 2,350mAh battery, and Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. \nThe new Galaxy A lineup will go on sale in Europe in early February, while a few Asian markets will be seeing a launch sometime in late January. As confirmed by a leak , Samsung Malaysia will be taking pre-orders starting January 6th, and details on availability in other markets and the handsets’ official pricing should soon be revealed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T09:05:23.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
