Emma's decision to stick to eco-fashion on the red carpet isn't a surprise: “I made a choice last year that I would only wear sustainable fashion on the red carpet,\" she told CNN Style last May. \"The fashion industry is the second-biggest pollutant of fresh water on the planet. It has such a huge environment impact and such a big human impact. And it’s just not enough for me anymore that it’s a beautiful item or a beautiful piece. I want to know that it’s not leaving a negative mark.\" \nNow, with her first major promotional tour since the statement, she's finally getting the chance to put her money where her mouth is. Her first post features the actress looking casually cool in Paris, with a caption designed to raise consciousness. Photo: @the_press_tour \"Bonjour Paris! Coat is from @stellamccartney, the world's first luxury brand that is committed to producing products that do not use leather, skins, feathers or fur. Instead, Stella has spent years developing ways of using materials such as regenerated cashmere, recycled fabrics, organic cotton and forest-friendly fabrics. Jumper is from @filippa_k, a Swedish brand committed to four Rs: reducing, repairing, reusing and recycling. Shoes are @goodguysdontwearleather. The brand doesn’t use any animal products in its collections.
