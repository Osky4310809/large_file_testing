The suspect has been a person of interest for the past six months.\nPIX11 interviewed Desire Brazell in 2014 for a Mary Murphy Mystery segment.\nAt the time, Brazell tearfully told PIX11, \"I don't want him to be just the face on the poster,\" referring to the Crime Stoppers flyers that were plastered at subway stations on the anniversary of the crime, promising $22,000 in reward money.\nRashawn Brazell was gay and highly charismatic, and there were conflicting theories about what the motive for the crime was.\nBut there was no doubt the murder was gruesome.\nBrazell was last seen leaving his family's apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn about 7:30 a.m. on Feb. 14, 2005, walking toward the Gates Avenue elevated train station.\nIt is not clear whether he ever got on the train.\nRead more about cold cases: \n\nThree days later, Brazell's torso, legs and one arm were found in trash bags in a subway tunnel on the A line.\nAnother arm and hand were discovered a couple of days later at a Greenpoint, Brooklyn recycling plant.\nBrazell's head was never recovered.\n\"I didn't get to look on him again,\" Desire Brazell told PIX11 through tears in 2014. \"No one deserves to end up being thrown away, like they're just trash.\"\nDetectives found a key piece of evidence in the case early on: a black, Rooster brand tool bag that had the victim's blood inside, among tool bits. The bag used to be sold by Lowe's.\nThe then-unsolved case became the focus of a documentary by filmmaker Terik King, who called the project \"Rashawn's Desire: The Untold Story of Rashawn Brazell.\"\nIn the documentary, Rashawn's high school principal recalled that Rashawn used to work at Burger King and other jobs, trying to earn a living.\n\"I learned about his charitable nature, and that's not something typical for a 19-year-old,\" King told PIX11. \"I think Shawn had a blind spot when it came to how evil people could be.\"\nThere was a scholarship in Rashawn Brazell's name, and the man who was running the fund got a taunting message one year that sounded like a confession from the then-unknown killer.\n\"The tone of it was, 'he wasn't an angel, I paid someone to do it,'\" Terik King told PIX11.\nDesire Brazell is haunted by the feeling that her son was held against his will and tortured before his murder.\n\"I just go over in my head, there was nothing I could do for him,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:39:49.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
