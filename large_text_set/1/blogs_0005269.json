The Bible defines sin as the breaking, or transgression, of God's law (1 John 3:4). It is also described as disobedience or rebellion against God (Deuteronomy 9:7), as well as independence from God. The original translation means \"to miss the mark\" of God's holy standard of righteousness . \nHamartiology is the branch of theology that deals with the study of sin. It investigates how sin originated, how it affects the human race, the different types and degrees of sin, and the results of sin. \nWhile the basic origin of sin is unclear, we know that it came into the world when the serpent, Satan, tempted Adam and Eve and they disobeyed God (Genesis 3; Romans 5:12). The essence of the problem stemmed from the human desire to be like God . All sin, therefore, has its roots in idolatry—the attempt to put something or someone in the place of the Creator. Most often, that someone is one's own self. While God allows sin, he is not the author of sin. All sins are an offense to God, and they separate us from him (Isaiah 59:2). 7 Questions About Sin \nMany Christians are troubled by questions about sin. Besides defining sin, this article attempts to answer several frequently asked questions about sin. What Is Original Sin? \nWhile the term \"original sin\" is not expressly stated in the Bible, the Christian doctrine of original sin is based on verses that include Psalm 51:5, Romans 5:12-21 and 1 Corinthians 15:22. As a result of Adam's fall, sin entered the world. Adam, the head or root of the human race, caused every man after him to be born into a sinful state or fallen condition. Original sin, then, is the root of sin that taints the life of man. All humans have adopted this sin nature through Adam's original act of disobedience. Original sin is often referred to as \"inherited sin.\" Compare Denominations on the Doctrine of Original Sin Are All Sins Equal to God? \nThe Bible seems to indicate that there are degrees of sin —that some are more detestable to God than others (Deuteronomy 25:16; Proverbs 6:16-19). However, when it comes to the eternal consequences of sin, they are all the same. Every sin, every act of rebellion, leads to condemnation and eternal death (Romans 6:23). How Do We Deal With the Problem of Sin? \nWe've already established that sin is a serious problem . These verses leave us with no doubt: \nIsaiah 64:6 All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags ... (NIV) \nRomans 3:10-12 ...There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one. (NIV) \nRomans 3:23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (NIV) \nIf sin separates us from God and condemns us to death, how do we get free from its curse? Fortunately, God provided a solution through his Son, Jesus Christ . These resources will further explain God's answer to the problem of sin through his perfect plan of redemption .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:17:55.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
