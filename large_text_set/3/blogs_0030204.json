They’re created in the image of Donald Trump, so customers can lick and bite off the president’s head. \nAll of the proceeds are going to Planned Parenthood, reports Mashable , in response to Trump’s reinstatement of a policy that prevents non-government organizations in other countries from receiving federal funding if they perform abortions. \n“Sugar coated politics,” the product’s description reads. “Enjoy showing your friends Trump Sucks and take a moment with Trump that’s easier to stomach than any other. Here’s your chance to have a bite, to match his bark!” \nVisitors are introduced to several images of people enjoying the candies when they visit the company’s website, along with an option to purchase the candy for five euros (roughly $6). The lollipops come in two flavor combinations: butterscotch and sea salt, and strawberry and mint. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
