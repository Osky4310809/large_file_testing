Google's Tango program for phone-based AR will make its way to the DIA through the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro and a new AR experience built by GuidiGO, a developer which previously built tour apps for Google Glass . \n\nFour new AR experiences are showcased on Google's official blog today. Visitors can take a peek at the skeleton and innards inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, bring color back to long-faded artworks, unravel ancient scrolls, or view historical structures in scale. It's all intended to make the experience of exploring a museum more interactive and immersive.\n\nDIA visitors wanting to use AR to bring the past alive can request a Phab 2 Pro from the museum's front desk. Google promises more tango-based interactive experiences in museums around the world \"soon.\"\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T18:27:30.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
