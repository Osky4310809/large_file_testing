The top three teams in each division qualify for the postseason. \nThis is the last head-to-head game between Boston and Toronto, and a regulation win for the Bruins could really improve their chance of ending their two-year playoff drought. Sports Club Stats gives the Bruins a 90.2 percent chance to get in the playoffs, while the Leafs are at 62.9 percent. \nNot only would a victory give Boston a five-point lead with 10 games remaining in the regular season, it also would increase the Bruins’ regulation and overtime wins (ROW) edge over the Leafs to six. ROW is the first playoff tiebreaker if teams are tied at the end of the season. \nThe Leafs should be confident in this matchup, though. They’re 3-0-0 against the B’s this season, with a pair of 4-1 wins along with a 6-5 victory. Toronto also is 4-1-1 in its last six games, including a key 5-0 win over the resurgent Tampa Bay Lightning last Thursday. \nThe Bruins don’t have an easy schedule to end the regular season. Nine of Boston’s last 11 games are against teams currently in a playoff spot or within three points of a playoff spot. However, eight of those 11 games will be at TD Garden, where the Bruins are 7-1-0 in their last eight home games. \nStill, it’s going to be a tough road for the B’s down the stretch, and that’s why they must take care of business against the teams closest to them. The Bruins can’t give the Leafs — a mostly young, inexperienced team — any hope going into the final stage of the playoff race. \nThat makes Monday’s showdown a near-must-win for the Bruins. \nThumbnail photo via Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a Bruins/NHL question for Nick Goss?
