Case in point? This beautiful, brothy chicken tortilla soup. It's a set-it-and-forget-it dinner your whole family is sure to love. \nIf you've got a case of the sniffles or just want a light-yet-warming meal, this recipe is for you. Unlike a chowder or cream-based soup, this chicken tortilla number will fill you up without weighing you down. \nTo make the soup, simply place diced sweet onion, seeded and chopped jalapeños, and minced garlic in the bottom of your slow cooker. Then add boneless, skinless chicken breasts, ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Finally, pour your favorite enchilada sauce (you can use store-bought or homemade) and low-sodium chicken broth (again, feel free to use store-bought or homemade) into the slow cooker. Place the lid on and cook for either six to seven hours on low or four to six hours on high, depending what works best for your schedule. When the chicken is cooked, you shred it with two forks and then stir in cooked rice (optional), lime juice, and cilantro. \nThis soup is also great for entertaining. It requires minimal effort, but yields big flavor — no one has to know you didn't stand over the stove simmering it all day! (It will be our little secret.) The best part comes at the end, when you can customize how you garnish it. Set out an array of toppings (the author suggests tortilla chips, diced mango, sliced avocado, limes, shredded cheddar, and yogurt) and let your guests dress up their bowls to their own liking. It doesn't get any more fun or easy than that! \n→ Get the Recipe : Crockpot Spicy Chicken Tortilla Soup from Half Baked Harvest More posts in Delicious Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:57:49.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
