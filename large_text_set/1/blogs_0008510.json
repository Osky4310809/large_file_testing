Translation: \"Long live the People's Liberation Army!\" Chinese soldier \nA Chinese propaganda poster. Translation: \"Long live the People's Liberation Army!\" Fallout: New Vegas Edit \nIn addition to a few old ones from Fallout 3 , Fallout: New Vegas features a whole new set of posters. Unlike the ones in Fallout 3 , the majority of posters in this game were made post-war, or at least continue to be relevant in their original purpose (as is the case with the New Vegas city complex). NCR Propaganda Posters \nThe most common variety of poster in the Mojave Wasteland are propaganda advertisements for the New California Republic , of which there are several. The posters are mostly based on WWII American and British propaganda posters. Careless Talk Costs Lives Edit \nAn NCR Poster featuring an NCR Trooper, and above the trooper it reads: \"What I know-I keep to myself\" and below it reads \"CARELESS TALK COSTS LIVES,\" an obvious reference to the \"careless talk costs lives\" propaganda featured in Britain during World War II . Do Not Eat Irradiated Food \nThis poster is a warning to NCR Troopers about eating irradiated food, which reads: \" The NCR needs you strong. Do Not Eat IRRADIATED FOOD \". The real-world poster on which this is based can be found here . He fights for your FREEDOM! Edit \nThis propaganda poster is advertising the New California Republic Rangers . It reads: \"People of New Vegas... This is your FRIEND! He fights for your FREEDOM! \" This is a reference to a series of propaganda posters from World War II depicting soldiers in a near identical manner. There is a example here . The Legion Awaits at the Gates of Hell Edit \nThis poster shows a picture of Legate Lanius with silhouettes of many other Legion members behind him and the profile of an NCR soldier at the bottom. It reads: \"The Legion awaits at the gates of Hell... and the NCR is gonna send 'em IN!\" Loaded? \nThis propaganda poster is meant to scare NCR troopers about any STDs they might get from the prostitutes of New Vegas, it reads: \"Don't take chances with pick-ups... L oose women may also be Loaded with Disease .\" Women of the NCR \nA poster with a female NCR trooper saying, \"Every one of YOU who serves is a SLAP! across Caesar 's face! TAN HIS HIDE, LADIES! \" This propaganda references the sexist policies of Caesar's Legion . You are his Bitch! \nAn NCR poster showing a frumentarius over a green background with the text \"When you steal NCR equipment, tools, and personal property... YOU are his BITCH !\" You Bring Democracy to This Land \nA simple brown flyer with the text \"NCR Trooper... YOU bring DEMOCRACY to this land . Sunset Sarsaparilla Posters \nThere are three variants of the Sunset Sarsaparilla poster made by the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company Build Mass with Sass! Edit \nThe first one shows a man in a red and white striped suit lifting a barbell with little effort while drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla . The text reads \"Build Mass With SASS - Sunset Sarsaparilla\". \"Sass\" is an abbreviation of the pronunciation of the word \"sarsaparrilla\" (from Spanish) in English; the first \"r\" and the second \"a\" are omitted, and the \"rr\" and \"ll\" are pronounced as if there was only 1 of each. A Fresh Delight! \nThe next poster shows a girl with braids about to drink from a bottle. The text reads \"A Fresh Delight - Sunset Sarsaparilla\". Freshen Up! \nThe last poster depicts a man and woman wearing bathing suits and holding a Sunset Sarsaparilla Bottle. The text reads \"Freshen Up With Sunset Sarsaparilla\". The Most Popular Beverage in the West! \nA large billboard of a cowboy drinking a bottle of Sunset Sarsaparilla. It reads: \"The most popular Beverage in the West!\" and beneath the logo is \"Made with pure sugar cane!\" Poseidon Energy Posters \nThere are three Poseidon Energy posters that can be found throughout the Mojave Wasteland . Dawn Of A Golden Age Edit \nThe first one is very simple with a large Poseidon Energy logo in the center, the words \"HELIOS One\" as seen on the HELIOS One complex itself above the logo and the text \"The Dawn Of A Golden Age\" under the logo. Begin Your Odyssey With Us Edit \nThe second one has the text \"Begin Your Odyssey With Us\", and shows the Greek god Poseidon blowing into the sails of a Greek galley. These are obvious nods to the other uses of code names from Ancient Greek mythology such as Helios and Archimedes . Also by saying \"Odyssey\" it refers to Odysseus from the greek myth Odyssey. Ruler of The Tides of INNOVATION! \nThe last one starts with the text \"Ruler of The Tides of INNOVATION!\" with Poseidon below on a mountain top holding his trident. Below is in a light blue box is the company logo and name. REPCONN Aerospace Posters Edit \nThe posters issued by REPCONN Aerospace are all orientated toward its employees since REPCONN wasn't a company that built devices for commercial use. The posters all have to do with the heavy safety measures that are active in all REPCONN facilities to prevent corporate espionage. You can see that the posters are from REPCONN because they all have a small REPCONN Aerospace logo in one of the corners. They are misspelled/bugged however and read REPCON instead (confirmed on all consoles). Only You Can Prevent CORPORATE ESPIONAGE Edit \nThis poster shows the silhouette of a man wearing a raincoat with the collar up and a hat groping towards the files in a drawer of a filing cabinet . This poster was probably issued together with the message found on terminals in the REPCONN test site about who you shouldn't tell about what you were working on at REPCONN. SECURITY Is Your Duty \nThis poster shows a the silhouette of a walking man with a hat and a suitcase while the background shows two wide-open eyes again. It serves the same purpose as the \"corporate espionage\" poster. Wear Your badge! IT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE! Edit \nThis poster shows a man in a black suit wearing a tie with his hands up and a terrified look on his face while a sentry bot is closing up on him from behind. This poster is still a warning to all people trying to scavenge the REPCONN headquarters where the security system will activate hidden sentry bots if the player is not able to show the correct keycard for that floor to the facial recognition scanners . YOU! Employees Are Our Greatest Asset \nThis poster shows three REPCONN employees behind each other, all facing the same direction. REPCONN HQ Museum Posters \nAdvertisements for the guided tours of the REPCONN/RobCo exhibition at the REPCONN headquarters . Both feature a highly stereotypical and boxy red robot that bears no real similarity to the models of robots that RobCo manufactured. Blast Off to the Future ! Edit \nThis advertisement also lists the museum's operating hours, which are still maintained by security robots 200 years later. The player, like any pre-War attendee, may only tour the museum between 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM. The billboard also mentions a gift shop, a reference to the rocket souvenirs , with their radioactive contents. Hold up, Rocketeers ! \nThe poster further reads: Looking for a tour? Blast up Highway 95 to REPCONN HQ in lovely Henderson! Nellis Air Force Base: KEEPING AMERICA SAFE! \nThe poster shows a typical American family standing hand in hand on a field with five airplanes coming overhead. Sierra Madre Posters \nAdverts for the Sierra Madre casino. Begin Again \nAn advertisement for the Sierra Madre Casino, a location in the New Vegas add-on pack \"Dead Money.\" It features the actress Vera Keyes . Found in the Executive suites and The Tampico . Sierra Madre", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T02:57:14.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
