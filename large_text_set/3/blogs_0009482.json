But it is so obvious what Arsene Wenger is trying to do. \nHe is digging in, putting his case as to why he should get a new two-year contract and claiming some fed-up fans have been “brainwashed” by the levels of criticism directed his way \nReaching the FA Cup semi-final is the new fourth place as Wenger set out to remind us about his ­remarkable record in the competition. \nHe has won it six times in his 20 year reign, is on course for a record seventh trophy and beating Lincoln made it 11 semi-finals, one more than even Sir Alex Ferguson managed. \nThat is unlikely to convince the growing army of discontented supporters who are making ­demonstrations a habit before every home game. They were outside the Emirates again on Saturday, all 200 of them.

The FA Cup has been Wenger’s salvation in the past and he is hoping it will be so again, as he clearly wants to stay at Arsenal but knows he has to convince the fans before signing any new deal. \nWenger feels the margin ­between success and failure – never better illustrated than in the Champions League – is too fine to be too harsh on Arsenal. \nHe said: “You can’t live in an isolated world. When you’re a footballer, even if you don’t read it you’re told what ­people think. You can’t live in a world where you can’t be influenced by ­anything. \n“For example, I watched the last 20 minutes of PSG v Barca again. It’s ­interesting when you see all the conclusions that come out of the game.

Ten minutes later, they’re absolutely rubbish. People brainwash you with what they think is right. \n“Get out of that heated ­atmosphere and look at things in an objective way. Sometimes it confirms what people say. Sometimes it doesn’t. \n“I managed about 2,000 games – I might know a ­little something about the game as well.” \nThe judgements have been as brutal from Arsenal old boys such as Ray Parlour and Paul Merson as from the likes of Roy Keane. With Arsenal out of the ­Champions League and title race, all largely said it is time for Wenger to go, which adds fuel to the fire for the fans. And Wenger accepts the cup might not be enough to satisfy some.

We’re in the semi-final of the FA Cup. How many times have we been? You have to ­accept nothing is good enough, you have to live with that. \n“The importance of the game has become bigger. You can’t ­escape any more. No matter where a player goes today it’s talked about. You have so many news ­channels.

And sometimes two and three, four, five or more.” \nWenger said he “would love” to make history by lifting the cup again, but added: “At the moment we’re far from that. Let’s get to back to winning habits in the Premier League. We have lost some ground and have a difficult game at West Brom next.” Theo Walcott celebrates after scoring in the FA Cup quarter-final (Photo: Rex Features) \nArsenal struggled for ­confidence in the first half against Lincoln, and did not make the breakthrough until Theo ­Walcott’s stoppage-time shot was deflected in. \nThe second half became an avalanche of goals, and tough on the National League visitors. \nOlivier Giroud, Alexis Sanchez, Luke Waterfall’s own goal and Aaron Ramsey turned it into a thrashing. But Lincoln left the pitch with heads held high. For Wenger it was a hollow victory and unlikely to change the mood. What Wenger's critics have said about him in the past month \nIAN WRIGHT \n“He looks like a lost man. It just seems to be mounting up. You’ve got the fans, the protests. It’s imploding. We’re going through a period in our history which is the worst that I can ever remember.” \nPAUL MERSON \n“Arsenal need someone much more ruthless. Someone like Koeman. He’s got a mean streak and he doesn’t let his players get away with anything. If not, they should get on the phone to Luis Enrique.” \nMARTIN KEOWN \n“It was embarrassing,” said Keown. “This is his lowest point. He looked particularly wounded. I feel for him; he almost needs to be protected from himself. This is 20 years of work here.” \nRIO FERDINAND \n“The last 10 years in terms of league trophies and the Champions League, it’s been a disappointing time for Arsene Wenger. Things are not going right and he can’t seem to find the answer.” \nJAMIE CARRAGHER \n\"Will the house come tumbling down without Wenger? No. They won before he arrived and they will win again in the future.
