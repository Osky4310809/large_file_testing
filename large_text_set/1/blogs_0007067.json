Allen and Tommy McNamara had signed new contracts with the club. \nBoth players were regular contributors to NYCFC in 2016, with McNamara becoming a stalwart in Patrick Vieira's starting XI. In addition, both Allen and McNamara are New York-area natives. \nArena puts his own stamp on January camp roster \n“I’m really excited to have signed a new deal,\" McNamara said in a club release. \"It’s been a very enjoyable two years and to be here from the opening day to where we are now, I know this club has helped me to grow in so many ways. It means a lot to play for this team – one, because I’ve been here to see the growth in the two years and two, because it’s my hometown club. It’s an honor to represent this city and these fans.\" \nAllen was equally happy to ink his new deal. \n“It means the world to me to have the opportunity to play in front of my friends and family week-in and week-out and it’s something I don’t take for granted,\" Allen said. “I want to help bring an MLS Cup to the Big Apple for a parade in New York City – that’s the ultimate goal and I’ll work every day to make that dream come true.” \nMcNamara, 25, is an original member of NYCFC. He joined the club in the 2015 expansion draft, and has since racked up 10 goals and 12 assists. \nAllen debuted with the NYCFC in May 2015, with the 26-year-old defender has scored once and tallied eight assists in his 38 regular season games with the club. \n“I’m so pleased that both RJ and Tommy have committed their futures to the club,\" Vieira said. “Both played huge roles in my first season here and have taken big strides in their respective developments to become important players for this team. \n“They are the perfect examples of the types of people we want in this squad, serving as role models for what can be achieved with hard work and love of the game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:31:47.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
