The classic holiday movie, which has spawned a loyal and dedicated fan base (and some haters ) since its 2003 release, is getting a 10-minute-long short film in honor of Comic Relief's Red Nose Day telethon. The short will check in with the film's beloved characters 14 years after the events of the first movie, and on Thursday, we got the first sneak peek at what's to come. \nA few of the film's original cast members, Liam Neeson (Daniel), Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Sam), and Olivia Olson (Joanna), were spotting filming a few scenes in London. If you need a small refresher, Neeson played a man who recently lost his wife and was suddenly the sole caretaker of her young son, Sam. While he initially thought Sam's withdrawn behavior was due to his mother's death, it was actually mostly because he was hopelessly in love with his American classmate Joanna. The new set photos hint at a ton of possible things: Did Sam and Joanna end up together? Are Sam and Daniel still as close as ever? We already can't wait!
