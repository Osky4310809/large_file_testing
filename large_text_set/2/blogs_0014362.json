The first was that there be a clear chain of command, and the second was that the structure of the National Security Council be restored so advisors like Steve Bannon would not be on the principals committee. \nHayes’ source reportedly said that Harward wrote to the White House early morning Thursday turning down the job, but the White House asked him to reconsider, which he did. But, Hayes adds, Harward again decided no “after watching the president’s press conference yesterday.” \n“Such a decision would indicate,” Hayes concluded, “the president’s press conference and more generally his temperament has impaired his ability to fill this vital role.” \nIt appears that Harward will be one of the guests on ABC’s This Week on Sunday to presumably address the matter himself. \nWatch Hayes’ report above, via MSNBC. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:09:31.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
