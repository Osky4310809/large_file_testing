Looking at this card head-on though, you wouldn't know it. It looks identical except for the model name. The combination of materials (namely cast aluminum and acrylic) is also the same, as is the commanding presence of its 62mm radial cooler. \nNvidia's reference GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is the same size as its Titan X (Pascal). The distance from the slot cover to end of the cooler spans 26.9cm. From the top of the motherboard slot to the top of the cooler, the card stands 10.5cm tall. And with a depth of 3.5cm, it fits nicely in a dual-slot form factor. We weighed the 1080 Ti and found that it's a little heavier than the Titan X at 1039g. \nThe top of the card looks just as familiar as its front, sporting a green back-lit logo, along with one eight- and one six-pin power connector. The bottom is even less interesting; there’s really nothing to say about its plain cover. \nSome hot air may escape the back of the card through its open vent. But the way Nvidia designed its thermal solution ensures most of the waste heat exhausts out the back. \nNvidia improves airflow through the cooler by removing its DVI output. You get three DisplayPort connectors and one HDMI 2.0 port, while a bundled DP-to-DVI dongle covers anyone still using that interface. Cooler Design \nWe had to dig deep in our tool box because Nvidia primarily uses thin 0.5mm screws, which fit into the mating threads of special piggyback screws that sit below the backplate. These uncommon M2.5 hex bolts also attach the card’s cover to its circuit board. \nOne improvement to the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti became apparent as we started taking the card apart: Nvidia mated the PWM controller on the back of its PCA with part of the backplate using thick thermal fleece. This is a material we don't see used very often, and it's meant to augment heat dissipation. The move would have been even more effective if Nvidia cut a hole into the plastic sheet covering the backplate in this area. \nThe exposed board reveals two areas on the left labeled THERMAL PAD 1 and THERMAL PAD 2. However, these do not actually host any thermal pads. We don’t know if Nvidia’s engineers deemed them unnecessary or if its accountants decided they were too expensive. Our measurements will tell. \nThe cooler’s massive bottom plate sports thermal pads for the voltage converters and memory modules, as well as several of the thermal fleece strips we mentioned previously. Those strips connect other on-board components to the cooler's bottom plate. \nSimilar to its other high-end Founders Edition cards, Nvidia uses a vapor chamber for cooling the GPU. It’s attached to the board with four spring bolts. Board Design & Components \nPhysically, the first thing you might notice about the PCA is its full complement of voltage regulators. Nvidia’s Titan X (Pascal) had the same layout, but not all of its emplacements were populated. The Quadro P6000, on the other hand, uses this board design. That card's eight-pin power connector points toward the back, and you can see the holes for it on the 1080 Ti's PCB. \nThe opposite holds true for memory: compared to Titan X (Pascal), one of GeForce GTX 1080 Ti's modules is missing. \nA total of 11 Micron MT58K256M321JA-110 GDDR5X are organized around the GP102 processor. They operate at 11 Gb/s data rates, which helps compensate for the missing 32-bit memory controller compared to Titan X. We asked Micron to speculate why Nvidia didn't use the 12 Gb/s MT58K256M321JA-120 modules advertised in its datasheet, and the company mentioned they aren't widely available yet, despite appearing in its catalog. \nNvidia sticks with the uP9511 we've seen several times now, which makes sense because this PWM controller allows for the concurrent operation of seven phases, as opposed to just 6(+2). The same hardware is used for all seven of the GPU's power phases, and they're found on the back of the board. \nThe voltage converters’ design is interesting in that it’s quite simple: one buck converter, the LM53603, is responsible for the high side, and two (instead of one) Fairchild D424 N-Channel MOSFETs operate on the low side. This setup spreads waste heat over twice the surface area, minimizing hot-spots. \nFor coils, Nvidia went with encapsulated ferrite chokes (roughly the same quality as Foxconn’s Magic coils). They can be installed by machines and aren’t push-through. Thermally, the back of the board is a good place for them, though we find it interesting that Nvidia doesn't do more to help cool these components. Stranger still, the capacitors right next to them receive cooling consideration. \nThe memory gets two power phases run in parallel by a single uP1685. The high side uses the FD424 mentioned above, whereas the low side sports two dual N-Channel Logic Level PowerTrench E6930 MOSFETs in a parallel configuration. Because the two phases are simpler, their coils are correspondingly smaller. \nSo, what’s the verdict on Nvidia's improved thermal solution? Based on what we found under the hood, it'd be safer to call this a cooling reconceptualization. Switching out active components and using additional thermal pads to more efficiently move waste heat are the most readily apparent updates. The cooler itself should perform identically to cards we've seen in the past. \nMORE: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Roundup How We Tested Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1080 Ti \nNvidia’s latest and greatest will no doubt be found in high-end platforms. Some of these may include Broadwell-E-based systems. However, we’re sticking with our MSI Z170 Gaming M7 motherboard, which was recently upgraded to host a Core i7-7700K CPU. The new processor is complemented by G.Skill’s F4-3000C15Q-16GRR memory kit. Intel’s Skylake architecture remains the company’s most effective per clock cycle, and a stock 4.2 GHz frequency is higher than the models with more cores. Crucial’s MX200 SSD remains, as does the Noctua NH-12S cooler and be quiet! Dark Power Pro 10 850W power supply. \nAs far as competition goes, the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is rivaled only by the $1200 Titan X (Pascal). The only other comparisons that make sense are Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080, the lower-end 1070, and AMD’s flagship Radeon R9 Fury X. We add a GeForce GTX 980 Ti to the mix for showing what 1080 Ti can do versus its predecessor. \nOur benchmark selection now includes Ashes of the Singularity , Battlefield 1 , Civilization VI , Doom , Grand Theft Auto V , Hitman , Metro: Last Light , Rise of the Tomb Raider , Tom Clancy’s The Division , Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands , and The Witcher 3 . That substantial list drops Battlefield 4 and Project CARS , but adds several others. \nThe testing methodology we're using comes from PresentMon: Performance In DirectX, OpenGL, And Vulkan . In short, all of these games are evaluated using a combination of OCAT and our own in-house GUI for PresentMon, with logging via AIDA64. If you want to know more about our charts (particularly the unevenness index), we recommend reading that story. \nAll of the numbers you see in today’s piece are fresh, using updated drivers. For Nvidia, we’re using build 378.78. AMD’s card utilizes Crimson ReLive Edition 17.2.1, which was the latest at test time.
