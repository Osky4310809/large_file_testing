winning field goal for Green Bay. Post to Facebook Packers TE Jared Cook on catch: 'I knew it was good' His reception set up the winning field goal for Green Bay.  //usat.ly/2iB9Usz   Packers TE Jared Cook on catch: 'I knew it was good' USA TODAY Sports Published 9:47   7 minutes ago Jared Cook (Photo: Dan Powers, USA TODAY Sports) \nJared Cook is a secret weapon no more for the Green Bay Packers. \nThe veteran tight end's late-season renaissance came to a peak Sunday night, as his toe-dragging catch down the sideline stunned onlookers and set up a 51-yard field goal that sent the Packers to the NFC Championship Game with a 34-31 win over the Dallas Cowboys . \nAs Aaron Rodgers drifted to his left and threw across his body on a third-and-20 from his own 32, Cook secured a pass that was originally ruled incomplete. But another official overruled the initial call, and the catch was upheld upon review. \n\"I knew it was good,\" Cook told reporters after the game. \"It was a perfect throw by Aaron.\" \nThe play set Packers kicker Mason Crosby up for a 51-yard field goal. After his first conversion was wiped out by a Cowboys timeout, Crosby's second attempt made it through the left upright. FACT: It doesn't get any better than this Jared Cook sideline grab. — NFL (@NFL) January 16, 2017 \nThe catch was a career highlight for Cook, an eight-year veteran who missed six games this season with an ankle injury. He was a rare free-agent signing by the Packers, who usually build solely through the draft. Cook finished Sunday's game with six catches for 104 yards and a touchdown. \nFor the Cowboys, the play was a devastating development after its defense had buckled down on Rodgers in the second half. With Aaron Rodgers, no ending out of reach for Packers \n“One thing he (Rodgers) is best at is he is able to extend plays,” Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. “It was a big-time throw and a great catch.\" \n“As for the secondary, you are defending field position there. But when the quarterback gets out of the pocket it is more challenging. The coverage broke down a little.” \nBut for the Packers, Cook's incredible play won't soon be forotten. \nSaid Rodgers: \"This one is special - more special than we've had in a while.\" Facebook Posted!
