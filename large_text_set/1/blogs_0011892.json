Pictures and wall hangings Pack Wine, Liquor or Other Unopened Bottles \nWine and alcohol can be packed early on in the process. Select the bottles you plan on opening between now and the move, and pack the rest . Other items you may want to pack now are food items that are in glass bottles, but are still sealed, such as cooking oils, specialty oils and fine vinegars. Remember, ask yourself if the weight of each item is worth the cost of moving it. For items such as aged olive oils, balsamic vinegars or truffle oil, it's worth the cost of moving. Pack Drawers and Shelves \nStart with the messiest drawer. Get rid of extra items or items you no longer use. Rule of thumb: if you haven't used it in the last 6 months, don't move it. \nPack the cutlery drawer, keeping only one set per family member. These sets will be kept in your essentials box. \nIf you still need to pack your cookbooks, do it now. Remember to pack books flat to prevent bending the spines. Place the books in the box according to preference; keep the books most used on top. If there's a book you'd like to include in your Essentials Box , keep it out. Just make sure you only set aside one. Your Essentials Box should be only for the most critical items. Pack Dishes \nPut together the cell boxes for glasses and stemware . Take your time with this step, ensuring items are packed well. This is also the time to pack plates and bowls and any odds and ends. Pack Pots and Pans \nKeep at least one all-purpose pot for your essentials box . Pack the rest , including lids and crockery. Pack the Pantry \nThe pantry should've been sorted by now, keeping only those items you want to move. Start with the spices then work your way to the larger items. Canned goods aren't worth moving unless you're moving yourself. Again, check the weight of each item and measure the cost to move it. Tape up any opened food packages and get rid of all perishables, including freezer items unless you're moving close-by. Prepare Appliances \nMake sure you properly prepare large appliances for your move . This should be done at least 24 hours in advance. Improper preparation can lead to gas leaks, broken parts and appliances that won't work. Read the manuals, and if you're unsure of how to prepare them, call a professional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T19:15:48.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
