Representative Joseph Crowley, the chairman of the Queens committee, and State Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie, the power behind the Bronx committee, are still irked over the outcome of the last Council speaker race, when their candidate, Mr. Garodnick, was defeated by the liberal coalition and the mayor’s maneuvering. Back then, Ms. Ferreras-Copeland bucked the county leaders to back Ms. Mark-Viverito and was later made chairwoman of the Finance Committee. But her decision earned her Mr. Crowley’s displeasure. Ms. Ferreras-Copeland played down the feud. “It’s like cousins,” she said. “Sometimes you fight and sometimes you want the favorite toy and you can’t have it. But you’re still family.” Mr. Crowley, too, dismissed the notion of lingering hard feelings. “I think, from a county standpoint, that all boats rise when people stick together,” he said, “and I think that’s the lesson that’s been learned here.” Photo Jumaane D. Williams, right, a member of the City Council, getting arrested last month during a protest against President Trump near Trump Tower. Credit Jeenah Moon for The New York Times The fallout of the 2014 speaker race also crosses borough lines. Ms. Mark-Viverito, whose district, District 8, includes East Harlem and part of the Bronx, was elected with the support of the Brooklyn County Committee, headed by Frank Seddio. Mr. Crowley and Mr. Seddio have not spoken since, according to two people close to the men who asked not to be identified so as not to jeopardize relationships with them. \nAdvertisement And the liberal coalition, known as the P rogressive Caucus, may not be as strong as it was last time, not least because many of its members are competing with each other to be speaker. All of these machinations have handicappers already contemplating the possibilities. They note that Mr. de Blasio may have less sway over the outcome this time around. After his strong election victory in 2013, Mr. de Blasio was an incoming first-term mayor who appeared to be riding a wave of progressive energy. But after a rocky first term he is wounded by multiple investigations into his fund-raising and actions in government; and many Council members have grown impatient with what they see as his garbled management style. What is more, Mr. de Blasio is heavily dependent on Mr. Heastie to push his agenda in Albany — which may induce him to either stay on the sidelines or back a Bronx-Queens candidate. Only four people have held the speaker position since the Council was expanded to its current size in 1992. The first was Peter F. Vallone, a powerful Queens councilman who held the Council’s top job, then called majority leader, before charter changes in 1989 increased the Council’s powers. Term limits forced Mr. Vallone from office in 2002, and in the jockeying to replace him, the Bronx-Queens alliance emerged as kingmaker, electing a Manhattanite, A. Gifford Miller, as speaker. Four years later, Christine C. Quinn, of Manhattan, took his place, again with support from Bronx and Queens. She outmaneuvered Mr. de Blasio, then a councilman from Brooklyn, who ran against her for the speakership. The selection of Ms. Mark-Viverito broke the pattern. But term limits have also affected the job by forcing candidates to come out early. All Council members know they have only two terms to make a mark, so those interested in serving as speaker begin lining up backing midway through their first term. They also have to be re-elected in November, although serious challengers to incumbents rarely emerge. In the end it is a numbers game. There are 51 Council members, meaning that at least 26 votes are needed to be elected speaker. The candidates are already counting. “You probably don’t get to where you’re putting together the 26-plus until December,” Mr. Van Bramer said. “I think we’re starting to see it go into overdrive because time is of the essence.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:59:12.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
