Or I just get the weirdos, like, ‘Want to do some bath salts and watch Antiques Roadshow?’ Regardless, I’m trying to be positive.”\nShe puts in her profile that she’s looking for a person, “who is intelligent and kind, full stop. A person who is established in their own life,” and adds that she’s “a strong, confident and independent woman.”\n“It’s been very hard for me to even find people to go out with, much less thinking about falling in love with someone,” Thore admits. “But now, I have posted my online dating profile, so we’ll see what happens now.”\nMy Big Fat Fabulous Life airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on TLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:33:25.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
