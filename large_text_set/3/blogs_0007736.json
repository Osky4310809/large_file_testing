(Photo: Getty) Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nWhen Jesus stood on a large rock and gave out five loaves of bread and five plump fish (did he invent fish fingers?), he wouldn't have opened his bread packets this way. \nNow sure, he wouldn't have because bread didn't come in plastic bags back then. But had they done. Oh, just look. Just look at this: \nYes, we know. It's a mess. Who opens their bread in such a way?

Some saw it as \"sinful\". Shocking It's unlikely that the culprit was raised by cats. But it's a possibility. Moving on, though, it became apparent that the mysterious Scotsman Alasdair lives with isn't alone in his breaded ways. poll loading Is opening bread like this okay? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T14:23:48.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
