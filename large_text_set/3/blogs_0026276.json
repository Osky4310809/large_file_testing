According to her father, Anthony McAllister, she was home on spring break from Saint Augustine’s University in Raleigh, North Carolina when tragedy struck. \nSometime around 8:40 p.m., the college teen was fatally shot in the 4300 block of Benning Road, Northeast, NBC reports . Police also revealed a second woman was shot and hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries before they arrived. \n“That’s my baby. I just miss her warm smile, the close relationship that we have,” Anthony McAllister told the press. He says his daughter was watching the video shoot of a friend who is a rapper and “she was at the wrong place at the wrong time.” \nAuthorities have yet to release any information about the gunman or a possible motive but are urging anyone with information surrounding the shooting or footage from the rap music video to contact the police at 202-727-9099. \nEarlier this year, Ayana McAllister’s cousin, Carrington Carter, was also shot and killed in Capitol Heights. \nUpon news of the shooting, Saint Augustine’s University tweeted out their condolences to McAllister’s family.
