Samsung is teasing something big with the Galaxy S8: just as the LG G6, this new S8 will redefine what we think about as a smartphone, bringing a 'full-screen' design and a ton of surprises. AKG headphones in the box with the Galaxy S8 So far, we've already seen countless leaked images and expected specs: the latest and most powerful Snapdragon 835 should power the phone, two versions are coming and both with a curved, edge display, a new Samsung Bixby assistant is in the plans and a lot more. The new thing that we learn today is that the Galaxy S8 will also come with AKG headphones in the box. Nice!
