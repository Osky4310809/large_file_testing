With White Hart Lane currently operating at a reduced capacity of about 31,500, it would amount to a maximum of about 4,700 tickets for Millwall fans. That number would have to be approved by the Safety Advisory Group, however — and it is believed the allocation is likely to be closer to the 3,000 mark. \nAll four quarter-finals, taking place between March 11-12, are to be televised, with the BBC having first choice of which games to show. Given the sensitive nature of this tie, it appears highly possible that the match will be allocated an early kick-off slot. Spurs must make Wembley home or it will cost them, writes Ferdinand \nTottenham are aware of the complaints made by Leicester to the FA after their 1-0 defeat at The Den in the fifth round. \nA Leicester spokesman said: “Following receipt of numerous complaints relating to the constant abuse, provocation and intimidation of our players, staff and supporters from our arrival at the stadium, throughout the match and in its immediate aftermath, we have registered our dissatisfaction with the FA. We are awaiting their response.” \nMillwall expressed disappointment that Leicester did not raise the issue on the day of the match. “We have been made aware of these allegations and are extremely disappointed that Leicester City, as is the professional protocol in such instances, did not raise them on the day of the game itself,” a spokesman for the League One club said.
