The date had been floated earlier this week in a story that also pinpointed the root cause of the explosions as, predictably, a faulty battery. \nThe press conference will be held at the company’s headquarters in Seoul, South Korea at 10AM local time, which actually puts it in the afternoon/evening of the 22, here in the States. \nThe presentation will feature Samsung executives, alongside “independent expert organizations” who took part in the investigation. The company will also be live streaming the presentation on its site. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:17:31.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
