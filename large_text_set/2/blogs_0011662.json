The 19-year-old from Johannesburg by way of the Congo weighs 78 pounds and measures just 3’7”, but the budding bodybuilder has six-pack abs and sleeve-busting biceps, and has no trouble out-lifting men twice his size in local fitness competitions, according to The Daily Star. \nMutombo suffers from a disability that prevented him from growing at a normal rate, and he completely stopped growing by the time he was 14 years old. But that didn’t stop him from learning to lift at age 12, picking up virtually anything he could—“from coffee tables to bags of books,” according to The Daily Star . By 16 he moved into the gym, and hasn’t stopped lifting since, participating in bodybuilding competitions and recently placing third in one local contest. “I love to see my body grow and feel full of energy and fit at the same time,” Mutombo told The Daily Star . “I wish to inspire people in general to work to stay fit and healthy.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:31:32.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
