Drops “Winning” Video You can call them B.O.Y., but don’t call them a girl group. This R&B/Hip Hop/Soul trio “Be Only You’ is redefining the term for a new generation with their new single “Winning,” which is now available at all digital retailers via Akademy Records. You can check out their debut video below.\n\nTheir latest single stands out amongst today’s contemporary R&B tracks; showcasing the trio’s talent for writing, composing and vocal technique. A modern day love song that celebrates the honeymoon period of a romantic relationship.\n“Winning is about a woman recognizing her partners worth. Sometimes it’s up to us to be encouraging, we see you fellas! “Winning” is how your partner should make you feel, like you won the lottery!” says the trio about the song.\nEach of the girls—Gianni Chapman, Miesha Green and Summer Killen—possess their own style, flow and personality. Bringing their raw edge to the collective, the young women exemplify individuality; lending true meaning to their name B.O.Y., “Be Only You.” Hailing from various parts of the country—Massachusetts, North Carolina and Virginia—the group relocated to Atlanta shortly after forming. The group has been training, rehearsing and recording with plans to put out a project this summer.\n“Winning” eSingle\niTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/album/id1212037905?ls=1&app=itunes \nApple Music: http://itunes.apple.com/album/id1212037905 \nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/609y2R0OJGmM7yuTRQFwQ4 \nTidal: http://tidal.com/us/store/album/71057457 \nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Explicit-B-O-Y/dp/B06XD5GMXQ \nGoogleplay: https://play.google.com/store/music/album/B_O_Y_Winning?id=Bau7cnws6kglkieeczy36hfqhvi \nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/boytillwedie/winning \nFor more information visit: http://www.officialboy.net \nPhoto Credit: Nikko Lamere \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T01:02:49.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
