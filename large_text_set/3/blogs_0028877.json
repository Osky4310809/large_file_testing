If you choose to study the modules together, you may therefore find study of W102 more challenging initially. Studying the two modules together is the equivalent of full-time study and you will need to be able to study for up to 35 hours each week. Also there may be some occasions when the face to face tutorials on W101 and W102 conflict by being on the same date.
