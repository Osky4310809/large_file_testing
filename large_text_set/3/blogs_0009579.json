By: FE Online | Published: March 11, 2017 1:39 PM With Congress struggling in terms of development and governance, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is all guns and have claimed to unseat chief minister Harish Rawat government, which is battling corruption charges. (PTI) \nAs the voting for Uttarakhand Assembly election 2017 commenced on February 15, there was an unprecedented enthusiasm seen among the electorates with a record voter turnaround of 68 per cent this year. Polling happened in as many as 69 constituencies spread across 13 districts including 7 in Garhwal region and 6 in Kumaon region of the state. With Congress struggling in terms of development and governance, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is all guns and have claimed to unseat chief minister Harish Rawat government, which is battling corruption charges. Out of the total 70 constituencies in the state, 1 constituency – Karnaprayag will vote on March 9 because of the sudden death of a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Kuldeep Singh Kanwasi. \nPolitical bigwigs are seen taking the centre stage and have made the Assembly polls a tough battle between friends and friend-turned-foes. Major party including both Congress and the BJP have faced revolts within their parties as several party leaders were denied tickets to accommodate new candidates. BJP has given tickets to as many as 15 new candidates, out of the total 70 and similarly Congress has too given priority to various outsiders and rebels. \nDehradun Cantt. is constituency No. 21 of Uttarakhand legislative assembly. It is situated in Dehradun district in Garhwal region of the state. It comes under the Tehri Garhwal Lok Sabha constituency. It is an open constituency. \nNumber of voters \nAs per the Election Commission data, Dehradun Cantt. has a total of 1,02,402 registered voters out of which 54,307 are male and 48,095 are female registered voters. \nWhat are the key issues \nEducation, roads construction and drainage systems, and regularisation of slum colonies are some key issues in this constituency. \nWho was the winner last time \nDuring the 2012 Assembly elections, BJP defeated the Congress by 5,095 votes to win this constituency. Harbans Kapoor who won from BJP, bagged 29,719 votes followed by Devendra Singh Sethi of Congress who got 24,624 votes. The voter turnout was 61.55 per cent. \nWho are the competing candidates \nHarbans Kapoor (BJP), Suryakant Dhasmana (Congress), Devendra Kumar (BSP) and Dr. R.K Pathak (SP). \nWhy this constituency is important? \nThough the sitting MLA Harbans Kapoor have performed satisfactorily in terms of development and growth works, a large section of voters feel the need of a new and young leader who can boost the development works undertaken by the incumbent BJP MLA. It will be interesting to see whether the sitting MLA was able to lure voters’ confidence or the mandate has given Congress candidate a cutting edge.
