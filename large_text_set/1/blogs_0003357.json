It would have the landmark qualities of a significant sporting venue with a clear identity and would declutter and unify the site.\" \nShould councillors give the go ahead only Mayor Sadiq Khan will be able to to stand in Chelsea's way. \nThe Blues are in desperate need of a new stadium, currently boasting only the seventh largest stadium in the Premier League - with Tottenham's new 61,000 seat home set to relegate them to fourth in London. \nThe club had previously considered moving to a new site at the former Battersea Power Station, but the expansion would allow them to stay at Stamford Bridge, which has been their home since 1905. poll loading Would Chelsea's new stadium be the best looking in London? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:12:16.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
