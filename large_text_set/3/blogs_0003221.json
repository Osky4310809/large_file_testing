According to Uproxx , New Orleans WWL-TV’s Sheba Turk took Beyoncé’s goddess-inspired Grammy Awards performance look and put her own unique spin on it for Fat Tuesday festivities, and we are absolutely living for her costume.\nFrom the flowing bronze-hued mane and the towering, regal headpiece to the show-stopping gown that helped her to mimic Bey’s adorable belly bump ,Turk’s intricate costume should definitely get the singer’s co-sign.\nShe posted side-by-side images on Twitter of her outfit and Bey’s onstage moment, and honestly, there’s no way Queen Bey wouldn’t approve of this most sincere form of flattery.\nClearly, Turk didn’t skimp on the details, and even incorporated her own background lighting.\nThanks to Shel Roumillat with the @nolacostumecenter and @DMassaWWL for turning me into Beyoncé for Mardi Gras on @WWLTV ! #nolanewsanchor pic.twitter.com/GIbmZIIhe6 \n— Sheba Turk (@ShebaTurk) February 28, 2017 Our heartfelt apologies to the Queen if this feels like the highest form of Bey-trayal, but we are absolutely bowing to your goddess lookalike.\nBow down #MardiGras2017 pic.twitter.com/ul2ceeXstG \n— Sheba Turk (@ShebaTurk) February 28, 2017 Here Turk is channeling her inner Queen Bey aka Sheyoncé. Photographer @TJPIPITONE got the sheyonce pics poppin #MardiGras2017 @WWLTV pic.twitter.com/t9NP5iOvxT \n— Sheba Turk (@ShebaTurk) February 28, 2017 And absolutely slaying the streets of The Big Easy. That's a wrap on #mardigras2017 coverage! Sheyonce shall live on forever #nola @wwltv #queenbey . Thanks again @NolaCostumeCtr pic.twitter.com/6bpZPaZYId \n— Sheba Turk (@ShebaTurk) February 28, 2017 Fabulous.\nThis isn’t the first time the Lemonade singer’s garments have moved her fans to recreate her look. We would still totally take fashion tips from this adorable 5-year-old who absolutely werked these Beyoncé costumes like a true diva-in-training. Then there’s the high schooler who recreated Beyonc é ‘s Met Gala look for prom and majorly inspired us in the process.\nThat said, Sheyoncé will go down in history as one of our fave Bey-inspired looks.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:28:43.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
