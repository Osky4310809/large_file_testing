All of the witnesses were associated with Islamic hardliner organizations such as the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) that have been pushing for Ahok to be jailed over a single sentence of a speech he made in the Thousand Islands back in September (a speech, the defense noted, that none of the witnesses had actually attended). \nAhok apparently did not sit idly by during their testimony, at one point shouting at a witness “ 'Who has given FPI the authority to speak on behalf of all Muslims?” \nDuring a press conference later in the day, Ahok told reporters about a few other problems he had with the prosecution’s witnesses. He specifically singled out FPI Jakarta secretary general Habib Novel for an odd discrepancy on the official court document detailing Novel’s personal details, which Novel signed off on as being complete and accurate. \n\"The name of the witness is Habib Novel. He worked from 1992 to 1995 at Pizza Hut. But perhaps because he was embarrassed to work at Pizza Hut, because it’s an American company, he deliberately wrote Fitsa Hats,\" Ahok said as quoted by Detik . \n\"He deliberately changed it. This is what I saw. I have to laugh. He says he did not notice, however, he signed off on it all,\" Ahok said, showing off the court documents. \nAccording to Ahok, Novel was ashamed to acknowledge that he worked for the American pizza powerhouse because of how often he said that Muslims should not be led by non-Muslims. \n\"I think he was embarrassed because he said Muslims should not be led by people who are not believers, the kafir (infidels),\" Ahok said. \nAnd thus a meme was born.
