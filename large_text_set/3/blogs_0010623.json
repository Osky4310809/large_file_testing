So here’s what I would like to do because I would like for you to be in my squad. I would like everyone to take an oath so that you can be in my squad. Raise your left hand. No, I’m sorry. Raise your right hand. Raise them both. And just repeat after me…”\nClick inside to hear Ellen’s awesome and hilarious oath… \n“I am good enough just as I am,” Ellen recited. “I am supposed to be unique and different. I’m not supposed to be like everyone else. I promise to be kind to people. I promise to brush my teeth every day and floss. And watch the Ellen show every single day.”\n“I love you all,” she finished. “You’re in my squad!” \nThank you to all the kids who chose me! #KCAs \nA post shared by Ellen (@theellenshow) on Mar 11, 2017 at 5:48pm PST \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T06:15:10.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
