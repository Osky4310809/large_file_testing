Then Collins hustled to recover the ball. It appeared that he recovered at the 1, though he rolled into the end zone. If he was outside of the end zone with control of the ball and voluntarily rolled into the end zone, that’s a safety. \nAll turnovers are reviewed in the NFL, and everything within a play is reviewable, so officials presumably looked at that part of the play. Either way, the Falcons were given a touchback and the ball at their 20. \nNFL vice president of officiating Dean Blandino explained the call. Gained possession with left leg touching the goal line so it is a touchback. Momentum and ball at 1-yd line if body part not in EZ. \n— Dean Blandino (@DeanBlandino) January 22, 2017 \nEven with that explanation, it was a close call. This game is ovah, but this was still a safety. pic.twitter.com/HcNWJ5qg2M \n— Dan Hanzus (@DanHanzus) January 22, 2017 \nIt was an enormous play for the Falcons. They scored on their next possession to take a 17-0 lead. It was a close call for Collins and the Falcons on a huge play. View photo .
