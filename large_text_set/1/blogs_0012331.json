Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nSince we’re currently stuck in that agonizingly long award show drought between the Golden Globes and the Oscars, it’s nice to hear about a couple of Hollywood types recognizing each other for being so woke. \nActress Natalie Portman recently revealed to Marie Claire UK that her “No Strings Attached” co-star, Ashton Kutcher, earned a salary more than three times what she was paid for the same film. Ashton Kutcher proud of Natalie Portman for speaking out about pay gap and fact he made 3x more than her for movie. https://t.co/jdEZdRGKTr pic.twitter.com/JC8Y8nC5Cx \n— ABC News (@ABC) January 12, 2017 @ABC he's proud he made 3x what she did? Good for him! \nKutcher tweeted Wednesday that he admired Portman and all other women standing up to close the gender pay gap. Does the Screen Actors Guild know about this problem? So proud of Natalie and all women who stand up for closing the gender pay gap! https://t.co/AV1uYY6KIe \n— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) January 11, 2017 \nABC News reports that Kutcher and Portman “join a host of other stars, including Jennifer Lawrence, Patricia Arquette, Sienna Miller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bradley Cooper, who have spoken out about the wage gap in Hollywood.” That’s a lot of speaking out, but what exactly is being done? @ABC one has to wonder why she signed a contract that she thought was unfair? why not hold out for a better contract? \n— James Reif (@reif_james) January 12, 2017 @ABC that's her fault and her agents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:02:29.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
