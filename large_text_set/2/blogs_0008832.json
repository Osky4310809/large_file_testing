Grace Poe, chair of the Senate committee on public services, reiterates the need for emergency powers to speed up the construction of the planned common station of the LRT-MRT. File, Senate photo MANILA, Philippines â€” Sen. Grace Poe reiterated the need for emergency powers to speed up the construction of the planned common station of the Light Railway Transit (LRT) and the Metro Rail Transit (MRT) on Tuesday. Poe, chair of the Senate committee on public services and sponsor of the bill said in a televised interview on Tuesday that having emergency powers will be helpful in allowing the government to get into a negotiated procurement. She added that there are only a few \"players\" capable enough to maintain trains used for the LRT and MRT. \"You need negotiated procurement because they have the technical, legal and financial capability. Those things will be included in the emergency powers,\" Poe said. She added that with the negotiated procurement, they will be allowed to go straight to the source that can provide the best expertise and technical support. In his first State of the Nation Address, President Rodrigo Dutere requested for emergency powers to solve the traffic problem in the Philippines. Poe then proposed Senate Bill 1284 or \"An Act Compelling the Government to Address the Transportation and Congestion Crisis Through the Grant of Emergency Powers to the President\" last December 2016, but admitted that the bill \"will not undergo smooth sailing.\" READ: Poe endorses emergency powers bill to plenary The senator said that she has been doing her best to push for the emergency powers to be passed. \"In fact, I appealed to my colleagues in the Senate to please speed up the interpellation process so we can already go to the third reading,\" Poe said. Plenary debates on the bill to grant Duterte emergency powers to solve the traffic crisis in the country started in the Senate last February 8. Poe said they will work double time to ensure that they come up with a law that will address the worsening traffic crisis. READ: Senators vow to work overtime on traffic emergency powers Poe however said that even if the Senate hearings are finished by March, the bicameral conference committee will also conduct hearings on the bill. \"We're in the Lower House and we have to get together to reconcile our bill,\" Poe said, adding that the Senate and House have two very different versions.
