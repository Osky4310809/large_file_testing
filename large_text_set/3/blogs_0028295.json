What’s going to happen?! It’s melting! It crashed! Oh my god!’ It’s like, just walk away… just walk away. It’s just a date!”\nHowever, after considering everything the show’s viewers have bounced back from in the past, he realized he was worried for no reason. “You know, I was actually thinking, ‘Is there going to be a backlash and people will think, “F—k you guys for that!”?’ But that’s really happened with every time the show kills off a major character: ‘Never again! F—k you! I’m never going to watch this show!’ And, you know, they keep coming back.”\nGame of Thrones returns to HBO on July 16, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:14:17.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
