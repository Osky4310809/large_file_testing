President Trump weighed in on the rowdy town halls this week too . \nSanford said on CNN late this afternoon that he wasn’t aware of any people coming in from outside the state, saying that he saw a lot of local people who were just very passionate in their beliefs. \n“This wasn’t an artificial crowd, it wasn’t manufactured,” he said. “It was real people with real concerns.” \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:31:40.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
