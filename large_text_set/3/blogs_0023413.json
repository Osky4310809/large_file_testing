The device itself has been subject to frequent leaks and rumors, especially over the past few weeks. From what we have learned so far, there will be two devices, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, with the standard variant reportedly sporting a 5.7-inch display while the larger sibling opts for a 6.2-inch display. \nNow, some new images of the device have just been leaked ahead of the official launch. As per the leak, the Galaxy S8 will let users change the default resolution of the display from within the settings.\nAs you can see in the image, users will be able to scale between three resolutions: WQHD+ (2960×1440), FHD+ (2220×1080), and HD+ (1480×720). The leaked image also reveals the weird aspect ratio (18:5:9) of the device, which perhaps is a result of Samsung’s new “Infinity Display” that the new S8 models will ship with.\n\nThis won’t be the first time Samsung will be including display scaling options, as the Galaxy S7 (with its Nougat update) and the Note 7 also offered the same options to change the native resolution of the screen, albeit the former’s screen resolution changing option was introduced primarily to force users onto FHD (1920×1080) on some S7 models in an effort to preserve battery life.\nMeanwhile, another leaked image also shows off the Galaxy S8 Plus’s retail box with Verizon branding labeled on the box. While the image doesn’t reveal key hardware specifications of the device, it does, however, show that the device will offer 64 GBs of internal storage. Hardly anything we wouldn’t expect from Samsung.\n\nSamsung’s launch event is scheduled for 29th March so we won’t have to wait long to learn more about both devices.\nSource: @UniverseIce ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:43:06.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
