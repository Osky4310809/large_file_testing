Joseph Victor Ejercito yesterday urged members of the Commission on Appointments (CA) from the House of Representatives who have interests in the mining industry to inhibit from the confirmation hearing of Environment Secretary Gina Lopez, which is set to take place next week. \nEjercito said it would be highly improper for the CA members who have interests in some mining firms to take part in the confirmation hearing of Lopez because it poses a clear conflict of interest on their part. \n“It will not look good for Congress as a whole if they are to vote,” he said. \nIn a statement posted on his Facebook page, Ejercito aired his support for the campaign of Lopez against illegal mining, even posting aerial photos of the areas destroyed due to the operations of mining firms. \n“I am supporting Sec. Gina Lopez in her campaign against the continued exploitation and destruction of our environment due to mining,” Ejercito said in Filipino. \nEjercito said he was saddened to see the state of the mining areas, particularly in Mindanao.   \n“Sec. Gina is the only person I have seen who fearlessly went after the big mining corporations. She has a tough battle ahead. Many in Congress own mining firms or have connections to mining. We should not miss this opportunity to have someone who is fighting for the environment,” he said. – With Victor Martin, Artemio Dumlao  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:45:07.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
