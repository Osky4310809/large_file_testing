They don’t care you’re not in the shape you used to be or if you’re struggling. \nFor the most part, they want to help you succeed, and they’re proud of you for showing up to better yourself and your health… \nUnless they’re assholes. \nReddit user southerndraw-er ran into a couple of jerks at the gym who were secretly taking photos of her and sending them in Snapchat . \nInstead of ending her gym membership, she showed how fearless she was and called out the bullies. \nShe wrote, \nI’m the fat girl. \nThis is my first week at the gym and every night after work, the same three girls are there. Today I found out they have been snap chatting pictures of me and making fun of me, but I don’t mind. \nI’m glad that you haven’t gone through what I’ve been through. I use to be in shape, I broke my hip and had to give up all exercise. Then my grandma got sick and I took care of her full time, I couldn’t leave her alone because I had no help, so I gained more weight. Then she died, and I ate my feelings and gained more weight. Now I’m a size 22. I don’t hate myself, or my body. I love who I am, and that took me my entire life to be able to honestly say those words. I love myself. \nIt really sucks that society, and your parents raised you that it was okay to try to hurt someone that’s trying to better themselves instead of trying to lift them up but I’m not mad. Thank you for reminding me to keep pushing after I had a really long day. In a month when the new year shit has worn off, I’m still going to be dieting and working my ass off at the gym everyday. It’s not so you, or anyone else, will [accept] me. It’s for me. \nI hope anyone else, who feels ugly or is over weight and has decided to make a life change will keep going. \nForget the skinny girls who laugh at you, or the muscly men that tell you you’re gross, love yourself. \nLet’s teach love, today’s world needs it. Thousands of people reached out to support her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:35:31.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
