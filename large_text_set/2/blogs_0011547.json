The LE is based on the Hilux 2.4G AT , which sits just below the range-topping 2.8L model in the local Hilux lineup . This limited edition is dressed up in a significantly more rugged outfit. \nThe Hilux LE comes in white, which contrasts nicely with the chrome-replacing dark add-ons. Up front, there’s a black grille, dark grey headlamp covers, gloss dark grey fog lamp covers and hood garnish. There’s also a bumper guard to emphasise the off-road look. No more chrome wing mirrors; they’re black here, along with the darkened rims and over fenders. \nBlack stripes sit on the truck’s bonnet and the roof gets a large piece of black sticker along with ornamental “roof rails”. Also present are carbon fibre effect stickers for the B pillars, dark grey rear lamp covers and more stripes on the side and tailgate. All the accessories have been tested and pass Toyota’s high quality standards, UMW Toyota Motor says.

The 2GD-FTV turbodiesel is paired to a six-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel drive. \nPriced at RM126,000 on-the-road including insurance, which is RM4,100 costlier than the standard 2.4G AT, the LE comes with keyless entry and push start, a 6.1-inch touchscreen head unit, eight-way powered driver’s seat, leather, three airbags, VSC and window tint, among other things. \nUMWT also took the opportunity to officially announce the 2.4G STD variants that appeared in price lists last month. The STD models have slightly lower specs than the 2.4G, which also mean lower entry prices – RM108,500 for the MT and RM118,300 for the AT. \nGALLERY: Toyota Hilux 2.4G AT 4×4 Research Toyota Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:43:36.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
