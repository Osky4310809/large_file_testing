We played golf, Ping Pong, flirted with girls, drove fast, got into trouble, and cracked a million jokes. \nAt Colgate University, I joined a fraternity (a big tribe), and I also started my own tribe: The Broken Lizard comedy group. Over the years, the five of us have written and starred in seven films, including Super Troopers, Beerfest, Club Dread, and more. I’ve directed each one. \nMaking movies is already a dream job, but ours is made better because we’re doing it together. When it goes well, it’s a thrill to share the hilarious, joyful adventures with friends you’ve known since you were eighteen—real friends, who you met before you had ambition. We spent two weeks in Australia on a “work trip” promoting Super Troopers , laughing from the second we got on the plane to the second we landed back in L.A. \nAnd when things go poorly, as they inevitably do in show business, we have a built-in support group to get through the dark days. \nWe grew up together, and have shared private jokes that span over three decades. Our comedy tribe has transformed into a machine built to take our personal, private jokes and adapt them for a mass audience. \nWe tour the country, getting paid to crack jokes on stage. Afterward, we’ll go to a bar, trade insults, form random alliances with and against each other, before breaking them on a dime to attack our former ally. We’ll happen into comic riffs, like replacing the word “meow” with “now.” Thankfully, someone wrote the words “meow=now” on a napkin, and a few days later, we inserted the joke into the script for Super Troopers. The “meow” joke became famous. \nOur fans often tell us that they see themselves in us. The relationship between the guys in Broken Lizard rings a bell with them, because they have their own little friend groups, with their own complex dynamics, and their own private jokes. In their minds, we kind of are them. We try to remember that when we write scripts. Meaning, we don’t worry ourselves about whether a general audience will like a joke. We just worry about whether we think it’s funny. If a joke makes our tribe laugh, we assume it will make other friend-tribes laugh. \nAs you get older, new tribes become harder to form. My last new tribe was in Los Angles, when I happened into a group of hard drinking, joke-cracking Ping-Pong players. Eventually, though, everyone got married and had kids, and that last tribe dissolved, too. Now, I hang around with my children’s friend’s dads. And while there are certainly some gems in the bunch, we’re all on our best behavior, so there are few funny, new wild stories to bond over. \nBut I still have Broken Lizard, and we still tour the country, cracking jokes and acting like 25-year olds. We also just made a new film, Super Troopers 2 , which is coming out this year. \nWhile we were in Massachusetts, shooting the film, we spent hours in hotel rooms, sporting huge mustaches, cracking new private jokes, and writing them all down on napkins. Many of them made it into Super Troopers 2. Hopefully, some of those jokes will land like “meow” did, so our little friend group can stay together and keep those laughs rolling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:24:40.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
