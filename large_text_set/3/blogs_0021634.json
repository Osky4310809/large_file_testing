With these affordable smartphones, the company aims to reinvent its portfolio with ‘high experience’ smartphones.\nThe Z25 sports a unibody design with premium chrome lining and a diamond cut finish. Of the two devices, only this one boasts of a fingerprint sensor. The company claims that the fingerprint sensor on the Z25 unlocks in only 0.16s, which is 20% faster than the fingerprint scanners found on other smartphones.\n\nLava Z25 Specifications Operating System: Android 6.0 Marshmallow with StarOS v3.3 Display: 5.5-inch HD IPS | 267 PPI | 2.5D curved glass | 500 nits brightness Processor: 64-bit 1.5GHz octa-core RAM: 4GB Internal Storage: 32GB; expandable up to 128 GB with microSD card Front Camera: 8MP with LED and spotlight flash | F2.0 aperture | 5-layer Largan lens Rear Camera: 13MP with LED flash | PDAF | F2.0 aperture | 5-layer Largan lens Battery: 3020mAh \nThe Z10 is the younger, and more affordable, sibling of the two devices launched. The Z10 sports an oleophobic coating and is just 8.4mm thick.\nLava Z10 Specifications Operating System: Android 6.0 Marshmallow with StarOS v3.3 Display: 5-inch HD IPS Processor: 64-bit 1.3GHz octa-core RAM: 2GB Internal Storage: 16GB; expandable up to 128 GB with microSD card Front Camera: 5MP with auto-flash | 4-layer Largan lens | F2.2 aperture Rear Camera: 8MP with LED flash| PDAF | F2.0 aperture | 5-layer Largan lens Battery: 2650mAh While the devices look premium, and looks like Lava has worked hard in the photography department, these device have to compete in the crowded budget and mid-range smartphone market in India. The Lava Z25 is priced at ₹18,500 while the Lava Z10 is priced at ₹11,500. The specifications are modest compared to the price, but being available offline across India is an edge the company has over online-only players.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T11:40:16.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
