Police later released the boys without charging them. As for Ferguson, Chief Raul Quezada said there was “insufficient evidence at the time to prove the officer's actions rose to the level of a criminal act.\" \n“Criminal charges could still be brought against any and all parties involved,” Quezada added. \nPolice Chief Charlie Beck has not commented publicly about the video or the multiple ongoing investigations of Ferguson, by the LAPD Force Investigation Division, the Office of the Inspector General and the Anaheim Police Department Homicide Detail, which is handling the criminal investigation. \nLAPD spokesman Officer Aareon Jefferson says Ferguson initially was put on administrative leave and has since been assigned to desk duty, pending the outcome of the investigation.

Police Commission President Matt Johnson were absent from the L.A. Police Commission meeting on Tuesday. (They were attending the 20-year anniversary of a notorious gun battle between police and two heavily armed bank robbers in North Hollywood.) But Black Lives Matter Los Angeles showed up, rallying about 30 supporters to attend the meeting. During the public comment period, several speakers called for the commission to discipline Ferguson, who department officials say has been a patrolman in the Hollywood Division since 2013. \nA discussion of the altercation in Anaheim was not on the agenda for Tuesday, and commissioners mostly steered clear of addressing it. The exception was Commissioner Cynthia McClain-Hill. Speaking at the conclusion of the public comment period, McClain-Hill said: \"If I believed that what I saw in that video represented this department’s training and this department’s officers en masse, I would consider my time here to be futile with the board. I don’t hold that view.” \nLuis Carrillo, an attorney representing a teenage girl involved in the violent confrontation, tells L.A. Weekly that his client, a student at Ball Junior High School, was part of a group that walked through Ferguson's front yard and was close by when the off-duty officer fired a round from his gun.
