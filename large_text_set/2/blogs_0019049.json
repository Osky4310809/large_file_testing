Focus is on production and supply of Rs 500 and lower denomination notes,” he tweeted. \n“Complaints of cash out in ATMs being addressed. Request everyone to draw the cash they actually require. Overdrawal by some deprives others,” he said in another tweet. \nLast week, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the remonetisation situation with regard to replenishing the scrapped currency is “almost normal” now and the Reserve Bank is monitoring the supply on a daily basis. \nThe government had announced withdrawal of old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes on November 8, 2016, with an aim to check black money, counterfeit notes and terror financing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:06:48.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
