(Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) \nAnd on the sixth day, the Trump administration continued its assault on the truth with an attack that mars the new president’s already precarious credibility and strikes at the nation's confidence in fair elections. \nJust as a pointless flap over the size of the Inauguration Day crowds started to subside, the president repeated another false assertion: that he lost the popular vote only because of 3 million to 5 million illegal votes. He made the comment to congressional leaders Monday, and doubled down on Twitter Wednesday, promising to ask for a “major investigation” of voter fraud. \nCertainly, if there were any truth to the fraud charge, it should be investigated as one of the biggest scandals in U.S. history. But Trump offered no evidence of massive fraud. When White House spokesman Sean Spicer scrambled to cite some factual backup during a news briefing, he conflated two studies , one of them largely debunked, and mangled the findings of the second. \nBoth these battles of the numbers are harmful, and both make the president seem insecure. \nThe vote fraud issue is the more ominous of the two. Last October, when candidate Trump was behind in the polls and tweeted about “large scale voter fraud … on and before Election Day,” it sounded like he was warming up to be a poor loser. Bad enough. \nNow, as president, he sounds like a poor winner. His baseless charge is heard around the world casting doubt on the integrity of American democracy, and it could pave the way for new efforts in the states to suppress turnout. \nTrump appears to be conflating fraud with problems in the voter registration rolls. According to a 2012 report by the Pew Center on the States , researchers found 2.75 million voters registered in more than one state and at least 1.8 million deceased individuals still on the rolls. But it did not find evidence of any significant number of people impersonating dead voters or voting twice. \nYes, some voter fraud exists. For example, in two Colorado counties , seven cases of voter fraud were successfully prosecuted between 2009 and 2015. A CBS station in Loveland, Colo., also found votes cast by about a half-dozen people impersonating deceased voters and a dozen cases of people voting twice. Investigations by newspapers in Florida and New York found more than 2,000 people who voted in two states in at least one election. \nBut the numbers are minuscule — a world away from the millions Trump has cited. And there’s this: The president’s own lawyers , arguing against a recount in Michigan, stated in a court filing: “All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.” \nFor Trump to be right, virtually every adult undocumented immigrant in the USA would have had to risk felony charges and deportation to vote for Hillary Clinton. The nation surely doesn't need any sort of major, taxpayer-paid investigation to prove that didn't happen. \nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board , separate from the news staff.
