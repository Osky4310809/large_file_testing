This powerful, and purposely created, chipset allows for a seamless connection to all iOS devices with a single-tap, as well as displaying additional information about the headphones on the device itself, such as the battery state and whether or not they are charging in the accompanying case. The chip also helps in increased range and battery life. \nSamsung already has its own wireless earphones in the form of the Gear IconX since June 2016. They cost around the $199.99 mark, but they don’t go as far as offering the same streamlined design or enhanced functionality that Apple has introduced with the AirPods. \nIt doesn’t come as a great surprise that Samsung, and other corporations for that matter, are looking at designing and releasing something similar to Apple’s AirPods, but the real test will be whether or not Samsung looks to release a product that’s uniquely designed in its own vision, or whether it simply copies Apple’s lead. \nWhatever the chosen route, these rumored truly-wireless and enhanced earphones should be an exciting proposition for those who regularly choose to purchase Samsung’s Galaxy S smartphones. The company’s recent acquisition of Harman International Industries puts it in a perfect position to release a wireless audio product that offers enhanced sound quality utilizing the expertise of that business and its technologies. \nAnother question that also remains unanswered is whether this new product will be offered in the box with every Galaxy S8, or sold as a separate accessory like Apple’s AirPods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:02:27.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
