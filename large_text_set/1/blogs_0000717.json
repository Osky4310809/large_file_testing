It features a new default skin, as well as a new default touchscreen skin, named Estuary and Estouchy, respectively. With all this work done over the months some bugs might slip through and were hoping to quickly squash the coming beta releases. The changes for this sixth beta are the result of the continuous effort from the developers, either from inside the team or outside to get v17 into final release shape. and any outside. We sure would like to thank every one involved with either development, testing or simply helping out others with question. Fixes done in this Beta 6: \n• Show select dialog for director button in the information panel if there’s more than one director • Fix video stall on Android during skipping of video or when opening the player controls • Fix potential memory leak in image handling • Fix several problems in the cmake build system • Redact username and password from the log if user has advancedsettings.xml • Fix creating temp folder when handling add-on updates on Windows which fixes the problem from Beta 4 • Fix possible crash on handling certain fonts • Fix possible EPG lock up • Fix ASS subtitles on Windows • Fix memory leak with ASS and certain regular subtitles on all platforms • Revert change that broke RTL (right to left) language subtitles • Force re scan of music file tags to makes use of the newest available library structure • Fix not updating the favourites menu item after changes had been made • Add privacy policy screen in system information • Remember last used subtitle service when searching again • Fix hash checking in add-on installer which caused certain add-on not downloading when multiple repositories were installed • Fix conversion of POPM music tag values to the new 0 to 10 rating • Fix several issues to further improve controller support • Update CEC library with additional fixes • Fix some tag reading issues from music files \nA full list of changes can be found here \n• Microsoft has rolled out a fix for users of the Kodi UWP version in combination with AMD videocard that had BSOD. For more information see: Blue screen with error code 0×139 Known problems \n• Upgrading the skin you are currently using fails on Windows. Temporary solution is switch back to the default Estuary skin and let the other skin update and then switch back. \nWe are trying to find the cause solve these problems. Of course there are some more however these are the most noticeable ones. Remember this is still Beta software so please be patient. \nWhat’s new? \n  \nForce music tag re-scan \nWith Kodi v17 a lot has changed in regards to the music library and part of this has been better tag scanning and usage. For this to work to it’s full potential it’s mandatory for your music files to be re-scanned and the available tags to be extracted.   \n\nEstuary and Estouchy: next generation \nPast March we announced that v17 would feature a brand new default skin called Estuary and since then it has been included in every build we have released. During this period our developers kept improving on how it looked, behaved and made use of the latest features that got included from what is shaping up to be the final release of v17. Since more and more users also started to use these development builds we started to receive a lot of feedback, where most was positive there was also some negative or at least constructive comments. As we are not deaf to these comments and try to create the best experience, our skin developer phil65 went back to the drawing board and rethought on how to incorporate this feedback into wat should become the final skin. With some help from ryanmah for the mockups, ichabod-fletchman for helping out this didn’t resulted in a total rewrite but simply reworking some parts of how the skin looks and behaves. The underlying skin code still remains the same for a very large part except for the parts where a smarter way of doing this magic was found. The visual top layer what you will see should still feel quite familiar if you have used any past v17 builds as not everything was redone. \n  screenshot   \n  installation. \n• Official Kodi 17.0 development downloads (near the bottom of the page) • LibreELEC Raspberry Pi / x86 versions can be found here  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:58:01.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
