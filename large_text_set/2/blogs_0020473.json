And now, people are getting freckles tattooed on them. Much like the semi-permanent art of microblading, or tattooing on eyebrows to look like individual hairs, freckle tattoos are less permanent than traditional tattoos and fade over time. With major retailers like Topshop selling “freckle pencils,” it only makes sense that someone, somewhere decided to take the look to the next, permanent, level. Most cosmetic tattoos come with a consultation, where you and your artist discuss what you would like to see as an end result.\nAlthough the look starts off bright, rest assured that the freckles fade to a more natural color. Even if you’re not blessed with the freckles of Pippy Longstocking, the phrase is fake it till you make it. And if you don’t totally adore your fake freckles, not to fret. You need to get them retouched every one to three years as is, so you don’t have to completely commit after the first time.\nA post shared by Adorned Precision Body Arts (@adornedtattoovancity) on Feb 9, 2017 at 1:16pm PST \nAlthough this trend isn’t for everyone, we do love how it adds some playful, and permanent, fun to a look.\nA post shared by Mo Southern (@mmsouthern) on Feb 15, 2017 at 11:23am PST \nWho knows, maybe the next “it” model will have her freckles tattooed on. No shame in the game!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:37:38.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
