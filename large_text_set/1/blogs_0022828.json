Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp will sell Daniel Sturridge in the summer after becoming frustrated with the striker’s injury record. \nKlopp has conceded that the 27-year-old England international doesn’t play enough games for him to have a future at Anfield. \nKlopp recognises Sturridge can be one of the Premier League’s most potent goalscorers when fully fit. \nBut since signing four years ago injuries have restricted the player to just 111 appearances where he has scored 59 goals. \nNow the Reds chief believes the end of the season is the right time to let Sturridge go and bring in more attacking power.

Liverpool also have an interest in Athletic Bilbao striker Inaki Williams.
