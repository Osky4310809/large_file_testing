In a teaser video, LG asks people to share their wish list for an ideal smartphone, and the replies include a big screen that's easy to use one-handed, water resistance, reliability, and a great camera. Unsurprisingly, the LG G6 will have all of those attributes.\nLG has already mentioned that it will not bring back the modular design for the LG G6 , and the phone is expected to feature a 5.7-inch \"QHD+\" LCD display with a resolution of 2880x1440. The handset will also likely retain a dual camera arrangement with a wide-angle lens complementing the primary shooter. With the launch just over a month away, we'll know more about what's in store with the LG G6 shortly.
