Now, she has admitted that she was the one who cut her face with her own safety pin. \n“I was suffering from depression at the time,” she said in court Monday. “I made a superficial scratch on my face. It was visible and I was embarrassed about what I’d done. So I made up a story and told a friend that a stranger had done it while I was walking. I was encouraged to report it to the police. I made the mistake of doing that.” \nBass claimed that she was “scared” after what some people said in a women’s literature review class, so she decided to scratch her own face because she “wanted a concrete reason to be scared,” The Washington Times reported.   \nThe Michigan Daily reported that Bass pleaded guilty to falsely reporting a misdemeanor and faced sentence of up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine. \nThe newspaper added that Douglas Mullkoff, Bass’ attorney, had requested that his client be sentenced in a mental health court, which is understandable because she sounds like she could use some help. \nPeople like Bass should be ashamed of actions like this. Their fake hate crime reports only distract attention from real hate crimes that occur in America far too often. \nHopefully, she will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.
