It's almost as if our knowledge, experiences, talents, success, social circle, family, and other important things don't matter at all, if we are on the single wagon. And the moment we go from the solo to taken status, we suddenly become more worthy. We know the feeling. Now, multiply that by 1017 times. That's what Valentine's Day feels like for the un-coupled ones. Before you get riled up, that doesn't mean that the day of love is the day you spend collapsed in a pile of bawling mess. In fact, quite the contrary. This is the day you take out for yourself, and do as your heart pleases. Because, the best lover you'll ever have is you! And here's how you can make yourself feel special this V-Day: 1. Sleep in... because you can never get enough of it! 2. Take a solo trip, and do some soul-searching 3. Go for a nice long massage 4. Check into a hotel, and spend leisurely time in the tub! 5. Stay in bed, and catch up on all those books you've had no time to read... 6. ... Or movies you've had no time to watch 7. Take a cheat day. In other words, dessert for breakfast! 8. Hit the dance floor with your girl gang!
