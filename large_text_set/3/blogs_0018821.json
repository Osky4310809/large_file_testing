Years of infertility \nMs Kennedy suffered years of infertility before she fell pregnant with Freddie at the age of 32. \n\"I thought I could just get married and children would naturally follow but in my mid 20s I learnt I had polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis,\" she said. \nMs Kennedy and husband Don adopted a daughter Rose from Vanuatu and continued to try a variety of medical treatments, such as medication to stimulate ovulation, to fall pregnant. \n\"I found the medical treatment for infertility very hard and I ended up with Type 2 diabetes because I put on a lot of weight from emotional eating,\" she said. \nMs Kennedy said she paused the fertility treatment to lose weight only to discover she was pregnant. \n\"The doctor ran a scan on me because they felt this mass that they thought was a cyst,\" she said. \n\"The doctor pointed at the screen and said 'That's what the mass is … that is your baby'. \n\"It was such a surprise.\" Diagnosis of Down syndrome \nMs Kennedy said she knew instinctively her son had Down syndrome when she held him for the first time. \n\"As soon as I looked at him I knew,\" she said. \n\"This wave came over me and straight away I felt everything was going to be OK, I had peace. \n\"I said to Freddie 'It's OK, God is going to look after us. We are going to be fine'.\" \nShe said while the midwives and doctors at the hospital provided support, the genetic counselling was unhelpful. \n\"Within 24 hours they sent a genetic counsellor to talk with me and she explained what Down syndrome is … and she said if the next child turns out to have Down syndrome in the genetic testing you don't have to worry because the government will pay for a free abortion. \n\"I am sitting there holding this beautiful baby and wondering if I am listening right.\" \nThe couple have since had three more children Preston, five, Indy, three, and Dash, nine months. Challenges and rewards \nMs Kennedy said her faith had sustained her during difficult times of raising Freddie. \n\"I used to try and do everything in my strength and the burden of doing that became too great for me,\" she said. \n\"People say how do you do it all? I ran out of my strength years ago and it is only in God's grace now. \n\"Every step with Freddie we have to work hard for. \n\"The sweetness in it is that even though Freddie took so long to reach his milestones — to roll over, to sit up, to drink out of a straw — it ends up becoming a very cherished life. \n\"I was very much in the fast lane as a small business owner and it made me slow down and cherish him.\" \nMs Kennedy also said Freddie had strengthened her marriage and family. \n\"We really have to work as a team with all our children but particularly Freddie because of his care.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T08:22:54.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
