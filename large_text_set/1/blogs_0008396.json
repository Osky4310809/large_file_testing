This gluten-free, vegetarian casserole uses both smoked mozzarella cheese and smoky paprika to liven up sweet potatoes and black beans, and it's hearty enough to serve as a main or side dish. For a Better Casserole, Cook the Onions First \nAs much as I wished that I could just stir all the ingredients together and throw the ingredients into the oven, the raw onions never quite softened up even after a long bake time. Instead, a quick sauté did the trick to make them tender and sweet. \nWhile you might think that the dish then takes longer to put together, the onions cook in about the same amount of time it takes to peel and dice the sweet potatoes, so get those started first while you prep everything else and you'll be fine. \nCanned black beans and drained canned tomatoes join the sweet potatoes and onions for the base, but the crowning finish to this casserole is a blanket of smoky, melted mozzarella cheese. It's worth it to seek out this cheese — and don't be tempted to use smoked Gouda, which is drier and doesn't melt as nicely.
