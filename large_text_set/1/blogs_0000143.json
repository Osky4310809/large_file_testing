The exact day & time is June 2, 2014 at approximately 7pm. I was having dinner with Steffi and Jenna at South Congress Cafe. I got a call from an unknown # and wondered if it was one of the candidates I was helping at the time. It was my friend Drew. Before even letting him talk, I told him that his wife Piper was probably already at the EMILY’s List event in Dallas and if he couldn’t get ahold of her, that was probably why. Except, he was the only person who knew why she wasn’t answering. Shortly after my last conversation with Grace , she and Piper were in a devastating accident on their way to Dallas. They were rear-ended by a semi-trailer. Drew had collected enough information to know that Piper was in serious condition and there had been one fatality. The woman was 59 years old and involved in the accident. It was Grace . I went back in the restaurant and quietly sat down. In an instant, the woman who was my boss and had become my fast friend and mentor was gone and I was one of two people who knew. The 24 hours that followed Grace’s death felt like an out-of-body experience. As you can imagine, we immediately grabbed the check and I started calling our friends/colleagues to let them know I needed to talk with them. It was right outside South Congress Cafe when a homeless man sitting on the sidewalk with a guitar asked me for money. I said I didn’t have any and walked back inside. I went straight to the bar and ordered him a filet mignon. I don’t know why. I had coffee with Jenna (my exec coach / mentor / jedi) the very next morning. Immediately, I mentioned that I would leave Annie’s List and politics. I would do my best to get through the next few weeks, help our young team and then I would be out. And that’s exactly what I did. But before I did, I took a month break to clear my head and mourn. Matilda was just a few months old at the time so I took a month to be with her in Seattle. As I reflected on my path and why I’d ever joined a campaign to begin with, it came to me. It was always about of giving people a voice, to ensure people felt heard. And, I didn’t feel like I could do that with a broken heart. So I left. I would lie (to my readership of 2, hi mom!) if I said I wasn’t scared out of my mind. My career was just being formed and I know it was highly likely that leaving mid-cycle would be a big mistake. In the very back of my head, I quietly questioned if I was making the right decision but my heart and my core told me to do it. My heart kept telling me: It isn’t always worth it. You don’t have to stay. It’s okay for your heart to be broken. If it doesn’t work out, you at least followed your heart. Let’s just go for a long walk and see where it leads. That long walk resulted in a lot of visits with family and friends, hikes with Ziggy, and small projects here and there thanks to the generosity of my friends. I didn’t think I would ever want to work a big campaign again, much less as presidential. In fact, on Grace’s last morning I’d spent my time joking on her obsession w/Hillary running for President. Fast forward, eight months down the road. Steffi encouraged me to call our friends who would maybe know what was going on with Hillary’s race, should she decide to run. I got off the phone and literally jumped on the bed (over and over). Steffi said she hadn’t seen me that happy in a long time. The next day, she convinced me to email a follow up. I must have typed that email in less than five minutes. Excerpt from my email pleading for the job. Two nights later, we celebrated we were moving to Nevada and I was jumping on this crazy adventure again. Some thought I was crazy for returning to Nevada for a third time but how could I not go back to the place that taught me everything I knew about organizing? The past two years have been an absolute treasure. Being a state director for Hillary in Nevada and Colorado has been the absolute dream of my life. Why? Because of the organizers and volunteers I met in every corner of every state who brought real joy back into my life. The story of Nevada, is one of a ragtag team pasted together from different backgrounds, cultures, educations, and immigration statuses. We may not have ever been the most sophisticated team or the team with every resource or with shiny allure, but one thing I know for sure — we were the team that was never going to be out worked or out-hearted. Hillary for Nevada Caucus Team, January 2, 2016 There were many days before the Nevada caucus when we were nervous we were going to lose or that the Nevada caucus would come and go, and everyone would sleep through it. But what I always told my team was: Stay focused. Do your best. Put your heart and the stories of our volunteers first. If we all do our part, on caucus day it will feel like magic. And, magic it was. When the NV caucus was called for Hillary. February 20, 2016 There is no doubt in my mind there will never be a win like that for me again. Ever. It was like lightning in a bottle and it will never be lost on me that we won because of our organizers. Plain and simple. When we won, I told Robby he should go upstairs to let HRC know we won. He told me I had to be the one. When I got up there, I let her know and immediately after I crouched up against the wall and cried and cried and cried. I was so proud of what my ragtag team of diverse kids had accomplished and above all — I was so grateful. Endless tears of joy with my friend Rory Reid and President Bill Clinton. January 20, 2016. In fact, before I introduced Hillary and as I began to thank our organizers and volunteers —  I cried again and I am so proud I did . I wanted the world to see how proud and grateful I am for them. One of the reasons I am still so proud of this, is kids like us, that organize in places and communities like Nevada, who have grown up in places and communities like Nevada — we don’t get wins like that. But this time, it was magic. There are many things to be proud of in the general election. The #NVMagic kids took their heart & hard work to just about every battleground state. One even ran for office! In Colorado, one of the things I am most proud of is the # of kids from NV and other early states we were able to promote. One that is close to my heart is Alana who was an organizer for me in NV four years ago. She was our organizing director and in my opinion, she and her team were the best in the country. Early in the summer, there was talk about whether or not Colorado would be a battleground state. Our team wore that as a badge of honor. If we weren’t on TV, if the media wasn’t going to take our state seriously — our work mattered more. Our responsibility was higher. Hillary for Colorado Family. GOTV Retreat. In the end, we won Colorado but what I’m most proud of is in the details: For the first time in memory, Democratic voters registered outnumbered Republicans. Our state campaign was the most diverse in the country with 38% diverse, 52% female, and 15% Texan (kidding, kind of). 9 out of 13 of my senior staff were women. Sorry dudes! Millennial voters in CO surpassed the national avg. We won Colorado, but we lost the White House. We won Colorado, but we lost the White House. Thinking back to election night, feels like I was living an out-of-body experience. There was champagne (the expensive kind and the André kind), but it went unpopped. As the night went on, it became clearer we were not going to win. I looked around the room and just about every kid who I love with all my heart was sobbing. They were holding each other. They were googling results for precincts. They were checking in with their staff in the field. Then, they called Colorado but it didn’t matter. One image I will never forget is walking to the elevator and finding Cheska, our 19-year old deputy data director & DREAMer, drenched in tears scared for her family. I told her to get up. “Get up,” I said with faux-confidence. She did and I gave her a stern hug and told her everything was going to be okay. We got our team on a call to thank them and let them know we would all be meeting in Denver the next day for an unplanned meeting. At the end of the night, I asked everyone in our HQ to huddle one last time. I thanked them for their work. I congratulated them on our win. And with a cracked voice, I told them that although I knew things felt very very gray at the moment something good would come of it. We don’t know what it is or when it will come, but it is right around the corner. We ended with one last “HRC 2016.” That night I left the office with a new, more permanent resolve: I will do anything I can to take care of my kids / team. Anything. Enough is enough. I am more committed than ever. I will always take the lead. I will always speak up. Everything is too important. The next day, our entire team came together. Through more tears and cracked voices, and a few jokes (have to stay true to form) — I reminded my team (and myself) that on Hillary’s worst day, on one of the worst day’s of our country — Colorado was a bright spot. For some reason, the universe kindly allowed us to be a bright spot. But, it wasn’t free. It came with a lot of hard work and sacrifice. And now we have a responsibility to share that brightness everywhere we go. Everywhere. Then we reminded ourselves and each other of why we began to do this work in the first place and why we have to keep going. We all signed this flip chart as a commitment that we will keep going: Nov. 9th No doubt November 8th, 9th, 10th… (you get it) were tough, but the 650+ days that preceded it made it all worth it. And, I’m so hopeful. And, because I’m an organizer — here are my takeaways and love notes to our organizers: Above all, when there is heartache (loss of a campaign, loss of life) be rooted in gratitude: the time that we had together, the lessons we learned, the mistakes that we made, and the pranks that we played. When you get punched in the gut, don’t let it change you. When the universe feels so cruel, immediately show that your values and hopes will remain unchanged. You can do that by writing your intentions on flip chart paper or buying a homeless man a steak. When things appear dark or shattered, search for and lead with brightness. Take the good, learn from the bad, and keep going. Bright spots come in different shapes and sizes. It is not about winning or losing but about finding the brightness in our work. It can be as simple and as hard as registering someone for the first time or seeing your rock star volunteer lead a staging location without your help. Just think of all of the fellows you are recruited who are now committed for life. To the women leaders/organizers of the world: it is okay to lead with your heart and to show gratitude (or anger) with your tears. We get to decide the new norm. One of the things that I remember most of what Hillary said on the trail is that no one gets through life alone . That is in good times and in bad times, in wins and in losses. We won Colorado, but don’t forget for a second that we didn’t do it alone. It was a team effort — our volunteers lifted us at every turn, groups like New Era Colorado helped lead the way, and the wonderful Ken Salazars of the world reminded us at every turn of who we are fighting for. Don’t forget why we do this work. So many of us join campaigns and are involved in politics because we want to give others a voice. We must start within our own campaigns and our own teams by listening to one another and leading with kindness. A commitment is a commitment. Always remember the times our volunteers knocked on doors for us (whether in a snowstorm in Aspen or a heatwave in East Las Vegas). They showed up for us, and our commitment to them and their stories never ends. And, if you let them, their stories will lift you up at every turn. And if that isn’t enough, do it for the Cheskas of the world. Let’s all be grateful for the good in 2016 and hopeful that in 2017 the best is yet to come. But, it’s on us.
