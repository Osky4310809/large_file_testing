Louis-Dreyfus’ son Charlie Hall is a member of the Northwestern basketball team, and his mom was super excited to see her son’s team find its way to the NCAA Tournament (as moms do). \nHowever, Louis-Dreyfus’ reaction was even better because she used a video of herself as Elaine from Seinfeld to illustrate how happy she was to see Northwestern make it. \n— Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) March 12, 2017 \nThe little kicks are perfect for “the Big Dance” and the Wildcats landing the eighth seed in the West means they’ll have a fighting chance to advance to the second round. The Wildcats will face No. 9 Vanderbilt in their first round game and if they advance they would have the tall task of playing top-seeded Gonzaga in the second round.
