And she will have a bigger cell than those of others,” Reuters quoted Kim Kyung-soo, a retired prosecutor who interrogated two ex-leaders, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, in a 1995 treason and bribery case. \nApart from that, Park will have to obey the same detention rules as the others, such as getting up at 6:30am and going to bed at about 9pm. \nShe will also be allowed to watch pre-recorded TV programs, cleared by the Justice Ministry, and will be served a rotating 2,500-calorie set of meals. Citing the prison food menu, Reuters reports her $1.30 Friday lunch will include rice with bean sprouts, kimchi, cabbage stew and seaweed. \nPark is well known for her chignon hairstyle, something she will have to give up behind bars: inmates can access a hairdresser, but only to cut their hair. Hair dye is also not allowed. \nAt the beginning of March, the former South Korean leader was still living in the presidential residence Blue House. She then moved to a smaller, private home. She was taken to the detention center on Friday. \nAt the center, her ID was checked, a short health exam conducted and mugshot taken. \nREAD MORE: South Korean court upholds President Park’s impeachment, removing her from office \nThe former president will spend up to 20 days at the detention center, but the term she may ultimately face is 10 years. \nPark was impeached and is accused of conspiring with her friend Choi Soon-sil to obtain millions of dollars from South Korean conglomerates. Both women deny the accusations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:48:57.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
