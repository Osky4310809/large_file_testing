Well, when it comes to giving to charities with little or no effort on your part, these words can be applied literally.\nSince you already love shopping anyway, why not adjust your habits slightly and make a difference in someone else's world while crossing off items on your list? Keep scrolling for ways to easily magnify your generosity every time you go shopping.\n1. Use Coin Up to donate extra change to charity. Using the Coin Up app is simple: choose a charity you care about, and then with every credit or debit card transaction, round up the total to the next dollar, sending the extra change to your charity. For example, if those fancy chocolates for your boss totaled $38.25, use Coin Up to charge $39, and the extra $0.75 will go to your charity. It may seem minimal, but think about it: if every shopper used this app for just a few purchases per week, it would add up to some serious change .\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://www.coinupapp.com/", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ETjU3B-KXu-iTATv1VRgIXFTq4o/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/11/22/928/n/42301552/1576659553b6af7c_StockSnap_I93PW8NE0F.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-22T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:17:09.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
