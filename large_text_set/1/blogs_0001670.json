But it seems that one product was just the beginning of the icon's relationship with the legendary makeup brand. A larger, 15-piece MAC x Caitlyn Jenner collection will make its debut on MACCosmetics.com on Jan. 5. \nMAC's mission statement has long been \"All Races, All Sexes, All Ages,\" so it makes sense that Caitlyn, who bravely shared her transition with the world, would be the face of a campaign celebrating that credo. We can tell that the Olympian added her glam touches to the collection, too: this round of products also got a sleek new makeover. Instead of being housed in the classic brand packaging, this launch's items feature a bold \"Caitlyn Jenner\" logo printed on metallic gold and matte black components. \nWe also noticed a sly nod to one of her daughters in the collection. The two lip pencils in the lineup — Soar and Whirl — are noted favorites of Kylie's, and she used them before developing her now-notorious Lip Kits.
