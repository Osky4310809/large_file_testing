The Honor 8 Lite sports a 5.2-inch 1080p display, 3GB RAM and Nougat, up for pre-order in Finland By February 2, 2017 “The Honor 8 Lite is a mid-range offering with a premium design” \nEarlier this week, a couple of press renders of the Honor 8 Lite hit the interwebs. Now, the phone has reportedly been launched in Finland, and is already available to pre-order in the country. The Honor 8 Lite comes as a stripped-down variant of the Honor 8 . Unlike the dual rear camera-toting Honor 8 ( review ), the Honor 8 Lite only gets a single snapper at the rear. However, the phone retains a premium metal and glass sandwich design, just like its high-end sibling. \nAs far as the specs are concerned, the Honor 8 Lite features a 5.2-inch LTPS full HD display with a 2.5D curved glass on top, encased in a slim 7.6mm body. The phone is powered by an octa-core Kirin 655 processor, mated to 3GB of RAM. The storage on board is 16GB, which users can further increase up to 128GB by inserting a microSD card. \nThe Honor 8 Lite boots Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box with EMUI 5.0 on top. The camera department includes a 12-megapixel primary shooter with an LED flash and autofocus, and an 8-megapixel secondary snapper. The device is fuelled by a 3,000mAh battery, and sports a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. \nThe Honor 8 Lite is available to pre-order in Finland, and will go on sale in the country starting February 17th. The phone has been priced at EUR 269 (around Rs 19,500), and is being offered in black, gold, white and blue hues. There’s no word yet when the brand will be launching the phone in other markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:23:23.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
