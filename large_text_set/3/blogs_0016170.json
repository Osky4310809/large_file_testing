Being in a relationship can be heaven as well as hell. But being single can be fun too with no strings attached. Let’s have a look at the pros of being single. 1. You get all your time for yourself \nNo need to worry about calls, texts, meetings and planning parties. You get all the time to think about yourself. You can work on building a better you. You get all the time to take up the things you have missed. Pursue your hobbies, go on an adventure, take up your dream job or spend holidays with your family. All your decisions lie in your court. 2. You can plan night outs with your friends without feeling guilty \nRelationship means hanging out with just one person for all the outings and dates. Isn’t it boring? Whereas being single comes with loads of freedom. You can pick up a bunch of your friends and hang out wherever, whenever you want. 3. You learn to be emotionally independent \nWe would all agree that being in a relationship makes us emotionally dependent upon the significant other. We start counting on them to make us happy. And thus, we end up disappointed and broken. Whereas being single makes us emotionally independent and happy. 4. The freedom to go on unending dates \nThis reminds me of a dialogue from the movie yeh jawaani hai dewaani “Shaadi is dal chawal for pachaas saal till you die … arre life mein thoda bahut keema pav, tangdi kabab, hakka noodle bhi hona chahiye nahi?” This is so apt for relationships too. Want some tangdi kebab, hakka noodle? For that, you gotta be single. 5. No need to be a social media stalker \nThere is no need to keep track of anyone’s social media activity. You don’t have to keep a check on the likings of your significant other. Instead, you can use that time to meet your own needs. 6. No relationships = more money \nBeing single comes up with immense savings in the long run. No fancy dates, outings, gifts hence no expenses. You can rather spend those savings in the betterment of yourself. 7. Say goodbye to phones \nA relationship demands effort and time. Being in a relationship calls for long chats and unending calls. Hence, people don’t get time to figure out what they want to do in their own life. Being single allows you to comprehend upon yourself and reflect on what you really want from life. 8. Less emotional drama and more peace \nWhen you are committed you always want to work upon it. In order to keep your commitments working you have to take care of your partner’s emotions while you choose to give up your own. As a result, it can get too frustrating if things don’t work out the way you want it to be. Whereas with a single status you can keep your mind intact and work upon your wishes. Hence, there are no disappointments and more happiness in your life. 9. You can work upon yourself \nRelationships are time-consuming. We spend all our time worrying about someone else’s problems that we forget to worry about our own. Being single gives you all the time in the world to build yourself and work upon your future. 10. You can avoid settling for less than what you deserve \nI have seen people being miserable in a relationship. Instead of giving up they are just going with the flow of it and destroying themselves. Don’t ever settle for less than what you deserve. This world is full of love if you find a person who is worthy of giving their all to you. \nIt is always better to wait for the right person than to end up being sorry with the wrong one. After all, life is full of unending opportunities. We need to let go of the wrong things in our life rather than letting them destroy our inner peace of mind. As the famous proverb goes, “A stitch in time saves nine” .
