I would like to thank Jamie Lorriman, the photographer who took the picture, for speaking to the media in my defence\". And now a statement from the young lady herself. #Westminster pic.twitter.com/inMFig3iQD — Stephen Knight (@GSpellchecker) March 24, 2017 \nPress photographer Lorriman said the woman was clearly “traumatised” and “visibly distressed”. He said she was just one of hundreds fleeing the bridge, trying to avoid looking at the “horror surrounding them”. \n“Her behaviour was completely in line with everyone else on the bridge, but you're not assuming others are callously ignoring the scenario,” he said. \nHe also criticised those taking the image out of context, saying: “I wish there was something I could do about it being misused and misinterpreted.” \n“It’s people who clearly have an agenda they want to push and will just put whatever they think out there,” he said. \n“I think hate is how it can be categorised - whether it’s racial, Islamic, whatever - people who hate will use anything as the weapon of their opinion.” \nOther people on social media have said the woman should never have had to justify her \"perfectly normal\" behaviour. Sad state of affairs that a woman should have to defend herself for just existing near a terror attack https://t.co/7YSTvQdUEa — Louise Ridley (@LouiseRidley) March 24, 2017 \nAt least 50 people were injured after terrorist Khalid Masood ploughed his car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. He then fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer before being shot dead. \nFour people were killed in the attack and 31 needed hospital treatment. It is believed 29 people remain in hospital, five of whom are in a critical condition and two have life-threatening injuries.
