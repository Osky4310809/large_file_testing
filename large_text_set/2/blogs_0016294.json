Here are their answers. \nMaura Bacik (senior-nursing) — Apollo \n“I’d say THON in general. It’s one of those topics where when people talk about it you get that feeling in your chest. It makes you so happy, and it makes your heart happy. Also, our two THON kids, Noah and Dev. I hung out with Dev all day today and she’s five years old. She’s such a little spitfire, so hanging out with them and seeing everything that they’ve been through and everything that they’ve conquered in their short lives is something that really inspires me and essentially inspires hope.” +12 \nAdam Hornung (senior-political science), participating with Sigma Chi, stands in the crowd at the Bryce Jordan Center for Penn State THON on Sunday February 19, 2017. KC Black \nAdam Hornung (senior-political science) — Sigma Chi \n“That’s a loaded question. “I guess it’s like envisioning something greater than yourself and overcoming adversity. It’s succeeding in whatever you want to achieve.\" +12 \nDan Bollinger (senior-hospitality management), partcipating with Springfield, stands in the crowd at the Bryce Jordan Center for Penn State THON on Sunday February 19, 2017. KC Black \nDan Bollinger (senior-hospitality management) — Springfield \n“What ignites hope within me is the possibility and what we’re all working towards here which is finding a cure for childhood cancer. Just letting these kids have a chance to one day live like the rest of us and do normal things that they maybe can’t do right now.” +12 \nBianca Angello (freshman-biology), participating with Atlas, stands in the crowd at the Bryce Jordan Center for Penn State THON on Sunday February 19, 2017. KC Black \nBianca Angello (freshman-biology) — Atlas \n“I guess what ignites hope is, i suppose in a big school like this there are not a lot of things that bring people together from all these different backgrounds. What really ignites hope within me is all of us come out here regardless of our differences, and we all kind of connect over this one thing that all of us, not even some of us, can empathize with.\" +12 \nMike Gindhart (sophomore-economics), participating with Delta Sigma Phi, stands in the crowd at the Bryce Jordan Center for Penn State THON on Sunday February 19, 2017. KC Black \nMike Gindhart (sophomore-economics) — Delta Sigma Phi \n“Kids different stories we’re seeing, and being able to talk to different families and see how much THON has done for them. I think that’s probably the biggest driver for me at THON every year.” +12 \nDennis Jacobs (freshman-aerospace engineering), participating with Theta Epsilon, stands in the crowd at the Bryce Jordan Center for Penn State THON on Sunday February 19, 2017.

KC Black \nMaya Demvy (freshman-biology) — Serve State \n“Just knowing that there are people who are willing to do stuff like this for people that they don’t even know just because of the principle of the thing and knowing they’re helping someone else. That really inspires me. THON is the perfect example of that. +12 \nMax Pessel (sophomore-engineering), participating with Pi Kappa Alpha, stands in the crowd at the Bryce Jordan Center for Penn State THON on Sunday February 19, 2017. KC Black \nMax Pessel (sophomore-engineering) — Pi Kappa Alpha \n“It’s just the fact that I know that we’re all contributing to a greater cause.

KC Black \nGabe Ferreri (sophomore-civil engineering) — Kappa Sigma \n“Hope for me, what ignites it is the promise of a better tomorrow and a future to look towards. That’s essentially what why I’m a part of this cause. You look at kids, and you know that they could have these long, prosperous futures ahead of them. They might not have that opportunity if they don’t receive these funds. Without hope, there is no looking forward to the next day in life.” +12 \nVictoria Christenseon (junior-material science and engineering), participating with the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, stands in the crowd at the Bryce Jordan Center for Penn State THON on Sunday February 19, 2017.

This whole weekend has just been introducing the freshman and transfer students to what THON is. We’re one college, one love, one fight. That’s what our saying is. Their passion feeds off me and ignites what I feel to my dancers.” +12 \nMatt Ramjit (sophomore-finance and economics), participating with Phi Kappa Theta, stands in the crowd at the Bryce Jordan Center for Penn State THON on Sunday February 19, 2017.
