He’s popped those claws through the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy, and, as of Logan , a trilogy of Wolverine solo films. \nAfter Logan , Jackman will hang up his claws and retire as Wolverine. Jackman was a guest on an episode of The Late Show Starring Jimmy Fallon last week, and Fallon questioned Jackman about how he made that decision. Jackman blamed it on comedy icon Jerry Seinfeld .

What was the tipping point?” Jackman recalled. “And he was very clear. He said, ‘Look, when you’re creating something it’s very important not to run yourself dry. It’s not about finishing on top, necessarily, but making sure you’re, creatively, still got something left, which propels you into the whatever’s next.’ \n“ As he was talking to me, I went home and said, ‘Deb, this is it. This is the last one,’” Jackman continued. “ And then, like, the next morning, I wake up at four in the morning and I record into a voice memo because I had this really strong idea of what to do for the next one, and that’s like two years ago or something.” \nAs Jackman goes on to explain, that idea became the seed for Logan . He didn't expect 20th Century fox to actually go through with the idea, but they did and writer/director James Mangold turned Jackman's idea into Logan . \nWith less than a week left until Logan hits theaters, the film has a 4.28 out of 5 ComicBook .com user anticipating rating, making it the third most anticipated upcoming comic book movie among ComicBook .com readers.
