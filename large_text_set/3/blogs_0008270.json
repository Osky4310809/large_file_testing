Honda highlighted the car’s three driving modes, including Comfort, Sport and +R, and 6-speed manual transmission. “A new single-mass flywheel reduces clutch inertia by 25 percent versus the previous (European) Type R and a lower final gear ratio is employed to improve acceleration response,” Honda explained.\nInside the car you’ll find support for the latest mobile syncing technologies, including Google Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. There’s a 7-inch touchscreen display in the dash and a 540-watt 12-speaker audio system, too. The gorgeous outside of the vehicle doesn’t hurt, either. Flip through the gallery above for a closer look at the new Honda Civic Type R.\nComing this spring The car’s engine will be manufactured in Ohio while the rest of the vehicle will be manufactured in Swindon, England. Look for the Honda Civic Type R this spring in the US.
