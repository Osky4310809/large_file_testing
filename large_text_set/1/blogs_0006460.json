Your promotion for fans to cheer against kids attempting free throws is tacky. Please find another in game promotion. @ChickfilA \n— ashley judd (@AshleyJudd) January 4, 2017 It's one thing to want to win. It's another thing to root for kids to lose so we get a product. We are better than that! #BBN @ChickfilA https://t.co/SJiUpSLSlC \n— ashley judd (@AshleyJudd) January 4, 2017 I prefer missed shots because of defense, steals, blocks, players being rattled by my team & the gym. Not because fans get a treat. https://t.co/spOCJoQWKD \n— ashley judd (@AshleyJudd) January 4, 2017 \nReactions… . @AshleyJudd Maybe you don't understand, we WANT the opponent to miss. Always.
