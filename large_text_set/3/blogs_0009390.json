After the Too Faced innovation dropped this time last year, palettes themed around the fuzzy fruit started popping up like, uh, fruity weeds, including the Kylie Cosmetics Royal Peach Palette . Then peachy lips, cheeks, and eyes swept the awards-season red carpets . As if that weren't enough, ColourPop's latest collection is packed with peach products. So why on earth wouldn't Too Faced ride the wave, too? The original peach-scented palette was so popular that the company created a whole collection around their best-selling product. Of course, the new lip oils, cheek palette, and blush sold out last December just as fast as the OG palette. And soon there will be even more peachy products to shop in the Too Faced Sweet Peach collection. Blandino posted not one, but two Instagram #sneakypeeks at the brand-new peach-themed products. Although he didn't specifically identify each product, he did write that they will be Sephora exclusives. We're guessing that the adorable peach-shaped compacts contain a new range of blushes. Lipstick also appears to be another addition to the lineup, seeing as how one of Blandino's pictures shows two different-sized lipstick tubes. Maybe there will be a mini set like the Kat Von D Rock Candy Studded Kiss Mini Lipstick Collection ? We sure hope so.

The pink-and-gold product looks a lot like a palette if you ask us. You can also see a sliver of the upcoming setting spray . There might be a peach primer, too. Sadly the text on the tube behind the lipsticks is blurry, but it seems like it says Perfect and Peachy. Here's the picture for you to take a closer look for yourself.
