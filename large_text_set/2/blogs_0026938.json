King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 5 \nSteel Panther guitarist Satchel revealed the band was forced to change its obscene lyrics only on one occasion, for the \" 17 Girls in a Row \" track off 2011's \" Balls Out .\" \nHe told Rock Sverige : \"We haven't really toned down anything that we've done in the US ever, except for one time when we did a line on the song '17 Girls in a Row' and our record company asked us to change it. \n\"The original lyrics were 'Spread my legs for a salad toss and I shot my load on the holy cross.' \n\"Our record company thought, 'We need to change that because the Catholic Church will come after us!' and I was like, 'Oh no, we can't change that! That's my favorite line in the whole song.' \n\"But we changed it for the record company and that's the one thing I regret. That's the only time we ever did that and I wish we hadn't. \n\"Most people don't really give us that much attention. Occasionally there will be an artist like Beyonce or somebody and they'll show a nipple or something and everybody will go crazy like 'Oh, that's offensive!' and I'm thinking, 'How come we can't get that attention? We offend everyone.'\" '17 Girls in a Row' lyrics \nI fucked 17 girls in a row last night and 10 of them gave me head I had to tip the maid a hundred dollar bill to clean the wet spot off the bed, yes I did The very next day I told the guys, they flipped me off and said that's all lies Got to admit I was a little peaved, Stix and Lexxi wouldn't believe I fucked seventeen Seventeen girls in a row What a dirty hoe I banged 17 girls in the grocery store and never lost my erection, no They had to mop all sperm in aisle 3 and some poop in the produce sex-sex-sex-tion, stinky When I told the boys in the band they said motherfucker, you're out of your fucking head I don't lie about the girls I screw, they're all so jealous 'cause they know it's true I fucked seventeen Seventeen girls in a row, yes I, yes I did Seventeen girls in a row Seventeen girls, I shoot my blanks in every hole Seventeen girls in a row When I was done, they were begging for more I fucked 17 girls at the trailer park down in Memphis, Tennessee I whipped out my dick and they got on their knees, like they were all getting ready to pray Wham to the bam to the thank you ma'am, then I praised the Lord like Billy Graham Hell, maybe where I'm gonna go, but when we get there I'm pretty sure the Devil will know I fucked seventeen Seventeen girls in a row Sweet, young, juicy pussy I fucked seventeen girls in a row Hop on that cameltoe", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:56:54.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
