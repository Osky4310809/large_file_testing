Being HANGRY (hungry plus angry) also qualifies as an emotion, FYI, and it's a state of being we know all too well! Considering the crazy amount of hours we spend on picking restaurants, making reservations and arguing over who's picking up the cheque - it's safe to say that (good) food also brings us closer. \nTaking inspiration from that first, very personal, truly individual feeling one gets taking that first bite of a delicious dish, is the FACE & PLATE project. It's a gathering of some sorts - an event if you may - where we invited 13 Internet-obsessed millennials (Instagramers, models, writers, bloggers et al) to showcase the range of emotions that only a well-presented hot-plate can bring us. \nNot hungry yet? These set of images will surely inspire you to go out and get yourself a plate of the best nihari you can find, or the juiciest lamb shanks money can buy, or just a really meaty burger ... You get the drill! \n1. Blogger Dolly Singh, from Spill The Sass , ate (rather stylishly) an ENTIRE plate of Chilly Chicken from Cafe Dalal Street. Because why not? (She never seems to put on one kilo, either!) \n2. Model Paramvir Singh's exotic plate of The Indonesian Nasi Goreng from The Flying Saucer Cafe was \"the best, fried rice\" he'd eaten, EVER! \n3. Actor and writer, Shibani Bedi loves gravy-especially when served with a pair of way-too-yummy Lamb Brochettes from The California Boulevard. \n4. Yogini Prachi Gangwani literally inhaled a plate of Burmese Bhel from Junkyard. In 10 minutes flat! \n5. Menswear blogger, Sahil Nandal (from Frankly Street ) declared his love for The Tandoori Chicken from NH44 by calling it, \"simply kickass!\" \n6. Akshay Sharma, from the, Never Stay Sober blog, described the Big Wong XL Crispy Prawns as, \"spicy, delicious and drool-worthy!\" \n7. Personal style blogger, Apurva Lama, of Appycat , thought the Double Fish Tikkas from Zabardast were indeed... \" Zabardast !\" \n8. Menswear blogger and designer, Nitish Arora almost got zen about the luscious Nihari From Coriander Leaf. \n9. Blogger Tejeshwar Sandhoo, from Blueberry Blackout , may have enjoyed his Grilled Fish with Veggies from 56 Ristorante Italiano a tad too much. \n10. Fashion and travel blogger, Monalisha Mohapatra \"really loved\" her lamb chops from Soda Bottle Openerwala. \n11. \"This Butter Chicken from The Hind Punjab is the ultimate anti-depressant!\" said actor and writer, Ankush Bahugana. \n12. Blogger and DIY-enthusiast, Charuta Arvind Yadav was obsessed with her Goan Prawn Fettuccine from Cafe Southall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:39:48.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
