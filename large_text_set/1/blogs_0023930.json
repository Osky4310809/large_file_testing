Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae, it took the trophy for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture, the SAG equivalent of a best film Academy Award. \nTheodore Melfi's movie, which recounts the story of African-American mathematicians who helped NASA put the first men in space, was a surprise winner, with Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea widely tipped for the top prize. \nIt also beat coming-of-age drama Moonlight , comedy Captain Fantastic and race relations story Fences . \nManchester star Casey Affleck – the frontrunner for the best actor Oscar – was also shut out, with the equivalent SAG award going instead to Denzel Washington for Fences . \nWashington, 62, who has two Oscars, also beat competition from Andrew Garfield ( Hacksaw Ridge ), Viggo Mortensen ( Captain Fantastic ) and Ryan Gosling ( La La Land ). \nIn the best actress category, Emma Stone won for La La Land , Damien Chazelle's whimsical tribute to the musicals of Hollywood's golden age. \nThe support acting awards went to Mahershala Ali for Moonlight and Viola Davis for Fences . \nOn the television side, 5 series were tied going into the show with 3 nominations each – Netflix's The Crown and Stranger Things , HBO's Game of Thrones and Westworld , and FX's The People v.
