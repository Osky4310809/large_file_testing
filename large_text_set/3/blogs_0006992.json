Pah!’ EU PM pours scorn on May’s Brexit vision and drops Art 50 bombshell ‘Global Britain? Pah!’ EU PM pours scorn on May’s Brexit vision and drops Art 50 bombshell LUXEMBOURG’S prime minister today poured scorn on Theresa May’s grand plan for a ‘global Britain’ as he stated that Article 50 can be reversed if UK voters decide they “love” the EU too much to leave. PUBLISHED: 16:59, Thu, Mar 9, 2017 | UPDATED: 17:56, Thu, Mar 9, 2017 GETTY Xavier Bettel said Article 50 could be reversed in the future \nXavier Bettel said his British counterpart had the “wrong idea” if she thought new relationships with the rest of the world could make up for EU membership but hinted European leaders are still open to welcoming the UK back into the fold. \nAt a summit of liberal leaders from across the continent he insisted the British will not be allowed to “have their cake and eat it” over single market access and free movement and described the decision to hold a referendum as a “mistake”.

Twitter/ALDE Group The Luxembourg PM made the remarks following a meeting of liberal leaders in Brussels EXPRESS The leaders met to discuss their approach to the upcoming Brexit talks \nSpeaking to reporters, he said there was “no division possible” between the four freedoms which are an integral part of membership of the bloc, and quoted a French saying to demonstrate that the UK will not be allowed to cherry pick the terms of its departure. \nMr Bettel said that \"to bake the cake and to eat the cake, this is not possible\", adding a warning that if the PM \"thinks that to have now new relations with other countries will help to resolve all problems, I really think it’s the wrong idea”. \nHe added: “They’re asking for the divorce, we didn’t ask. They said we want to get divorced, they organised a referendum for political reasons which is still a mistake. \n“I respect the choice of the British people but for me it was a mistake to organise a referendum about membership. They decided, we have to respect it even if I regret it. Now they ask for divorce.” Maybe during the procedure of divorce they will say ‘we love you that much that we are not able to conclude that divorce’ Xavier Bettel \nThe Luxembourg PM then dropped his bombshell about Article 50, saying British voters might decide they “love” the European project more than they realised and decide in a second vote that they do not want to quit the bloc. \nHe said: “Maybe during the procedure of divorce they will say ‘we love you that much that we are not able to conclude that divorce’. \n“Europe is based on values, these values are not possible to say that we do not care about them anymore. \n“I didn’t want to have hard Brexit because if they want to have hard Brexit, we will have to have hard negotiations too.” Who voted for Brexit? UK regions which voted leave revealed Mon, February 27, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain.

I think we are adults enough to be around the table and to find good solutions.” \nDuring the press conference the liberal leaders also stressed that both EU citizens in the UK and British people on the continent must not be “held hostage and used as bargaining chips” in the upcoming negotiations. \nThey urged Mrs May and eurocrats in Brussels to separate the issue of residency rights off from the rest of the talks to stop it being abused by either side if the political discussion on future relations turns nasty. \nAnd the liberal leaders also affirmed their commitment to securing a lasting solution for Northern Ireland, which voted to Remain, but which now faces the possibility of a hard land border being imposed with the south.
