The ceremonies will be broadcasted live at 8:30 a.m. PT, with Trump being sworn in and delivering his inaugural address at 9 a.m. PT. Musical guests, including Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down, will begin performing at 12:30 p.m. PT. \nWhile considered a historical event, the presidential inauguration isn't necessarily everyone’s forte. A number of Hollywood stars have expressed their opposition to watching the ceremony and have opted to focus on engaging in other activities . \nProducer and documentary filmmaker Lysa Heslov told The Hollywood Reporter , “I'm having a colonoscopy instead. I'm wearing a black surgical gown with a pussy bow as I will be in mourning.\" \nIn contrast, Pablo Larrain, the director of Jackie and Neruda , is choosing to be active, rather than sitting and watching the big day. \n\"On Inauguration Day, I think I'll be playing ping-pong. It's a very beautiful sport. It's very hard, and I'm very good at it,\" said Larrain. \nTransparent actress Amy Landecker has chosen to boycott watching the ceremony. She explained her protest saying, \"I feel like what [President-elect Trump] wants the most is ratings. And I think the greatest protest of all would be the lowest ratings in modern television inauguration history. Hashtag Don't watch.\" \nMeanwhile, the head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, has chosen to completely disregard the inauguration altogether. When discussing his plans for the newsworthy ceremony, Price said, \"Haven't made any plans — when is it?\" \nFor those feeling “trumped” over what to watch rather than the inauguration, a myriad of programs will air on television sure to offer alternate forms of good entertainment.
