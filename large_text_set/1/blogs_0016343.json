The band will play a set at Prophets Of Rage’s Anti-Inaugural Ball, an event at LA’s Teragram Ballroom on 1/20 that will also feature performances by Vic Mensa, Jackson Browne, Jack Black, and the Los Angeles Freedom Choir, aka a better lineup than the actual inaugural ball. As Morello explains in a statement: \nThe Anti-Inaugural Ball is a celebration of resistance. Resistance to racism. Resistance to sexism. Resistance to homophobia. Resistance to bullying. Resistance to environmental devastation. Resistance to fascism. Resistance to Donald Trump. We are staring down the barrel of a dystopian nightmare unless we act NOW, unless we fight back NOW. We intend to create “No Trump Zones” across the country; in our homes, our schools, our places of work, and our concert stages. Bad Presidents make for great music. Join us as we get loud and stand together to defend our rights, our country, and our planet. \nTickets are available here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:59:02.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
