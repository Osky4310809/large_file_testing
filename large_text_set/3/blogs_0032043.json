They can use any office in this building.” We won’t back down from protecting New Yorkers from terror – or from an overzealous administration fixated on xenophobia and division. https://t.co/HITtsr52xm \n— Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 27, 2017 Advertisement - story continues below \nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said obeying federal immigration rules would “undermine public safety and make our neighborhoods less safe.” \nSessions on Monday made it clear that leaders of sanctuary cities needed to act. \n“I strongly urge our nation’s states and cities and counties to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws, and to rethink these policies,” he said. “Such policies make their cities and states less safe, public safety as well as national security are at stake, and put them at the risk of losing federal dollars.” \nHe termed the mayors’ defiance “disheartening.” \n“The American people want and deserve a lawful system of immigration that keeps us safe, and one that serves national interests,” Sessions said. “This expectation is reasonable, just, and our government has the duty to meet it and we will meet it.” \nTrump signaled his support for Sessions Tuesday when he mentioned Sessions’ Monday announcement during meeting with the leaders of the Fraternal Order of Police. \n“That was a very important thing you did, and frankly, a very popular thing. It’s great to have you with us,” he told Sessions, who attended the event. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
