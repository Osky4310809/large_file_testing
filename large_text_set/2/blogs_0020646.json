My kids don't want for anything because my priorities are straight. And this also means I will have that extra $450 a month to do things with my kids.\"\n\nKnaack was unprepared for the response her Facebook post triggered. In less than a day it had received more than 170,000 likes and had been shared over 70,000 times. It also garnered more than 20,000 comments, with most people commending her decision to spend her money prudently.\n\"It's pretty crazy,\" she told WHNS. \"I was just sharing a milestone with my friends and family.\"\nNot all of the comments were kind, however. In a follow-up post on Feb. 23, Knaack responded to the people who wrote \"hateful comments,\" explaining why she chose to share her financial decision:\nI never expected to go viral. And as of January 3rd I celebrated 3 years clean. I didn't share this for attention from the world. I just shared my accomplishments with people I know. I made it public so if anyone shared it others could see it in hopes [that] a recovering addict would see it and see that life off the streets is possible and for any single moms to know it is possible to survive on your own. As long as my post has inspired people I'm happy with that.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:36:05.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
