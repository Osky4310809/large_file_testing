Mike Lee is urging House Republicans to cancel the vote, Sen. Rand Paul thinks House leadership will pull the bill on their own, realizing they don’t have the votes. \n“I am strongly, strongly persuaded that it is not going to pass. I think they should cancel the vote because they don't have the votes,” Lee told Fox News host Martha MacCallum. \n“The fact remains, they don't have the votes to pass this. They need to bring people and who have concerns, bring in conservatives, let them express what their concerns are. We can still fix this,” he added. \nLee said other Republicans shouldn’t feel they need to support the legislation because in its current form, it doesn’t live up to the GOP’s promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. \n“What we have been promising for seven years is if Republicans were given the chance to govern, we would repeal Obamacare, root and branch,” Lee continued. “That is not what this bill does. That is what we need to do and that is why I am holding out for a vote that fulfills that promise.” \nMeanwhile, Paul said even with the changes made, the bill is still Obamacare lite and without a last minute deal, House Republicans will realize they don’t have the support. \n\"I think there’s easily 35 no votes right now, so unless something happens in the next 24 hours, I would predict they pull the bill and start over,\" he told Breitbart News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:59:37.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
