They all decided—yes, including Daytona-only teammate Jeff Gordon—to wear temporary tattoos of the Rolex until the real one happened . \nDrivers Jeff Gordon, Jordan Taylor, Ricky Taylor and Max Angelelli sported the world’s most legit fake Rolex throughout the Rolex 24 weekend, and it worked! After a thoroughly insane finish to a mostly-damp day at Daytona, the team drove home to an overall win and got to take home one of the most coveted prizes in motorsport. \nThis was also longtime team member Angelelli’s last race with the Wayne Taylor Racing team, making the win all the more special.
