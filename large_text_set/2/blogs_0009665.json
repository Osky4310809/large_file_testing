Lars woke startled and patted the bed next to him where Debora, 48, usually slept. \n\"Stay here,\" he whispered, climbing out. \nLars, 48, grabbed his 20-gauge sawn-off shot gun and headed out onto the landing. There he saw the shadow of a dark figure and fired the weapon right at it. The shape dropped to the floor. \nWhen Lars struggled to reload, he hurried back to the bedroom for his handgun. Then he heard the sound of a woman moaning. It was a voice Lars recognised: his wife Debora’s. She wasn’t in bed at all – she was out on the landing, dying from a gunshot wound to the chest. Lars dialled 911. Shot in the dark \nLars and Debora lived in San Antonio, Texas. They had been married for just two years, and although the couple appeared happy, they were very different. Independent and private, Debora was the vice president of a prominent healthcare company and hadn’t changed her name when she married. She was worth over $1million (£800,000) and wanted to retire early. \nLars, who had long blonde hair at the time of the shooting, was a contractor earning significantly less. While Debora travelled with the elite for work, Lars was spending his time on building sites. It seemed that opposites attracted. \nThen tragedy struck at around 4am that fateful morning when Lars called 911 from his home. He sounded panicked as he explained what he’d done. The operator talked him through CPR and even told him to try plugging the wound in Debora’s chest with a plastic bag. But when paramedics arrived, Debora couldn’t be revived and was pronounced dead at the scene. She’d died from a single gunshot wound to the chest that was about the size of a tennis ball. \nWhen questioned by police, Lars insisted the whole thing had been an accident – just as disgraced South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius had done in his defence in 2013. Lars said he’d heard noises and had fired at what he thought was an intruder. \n\"I get up, I see a light, hear people talking and the next thing I know I see someone in front of me and I shot,\" he said. \"I go to get another gun, and I hear this moaning and realise it’s my wife. I never wanted to hurt my wife, ever. I loved my wife very much.\" \nInvestigators had concerns. Despite claiming to have performed CPR on Debora, Lars didn’t have blood on his hands when paramedics arrived. There were inconsistencies in his account about whether it was a creak, voices, or the dog that made him get out of bed. They felt like his grief was forced too – lots of crying sounds but no actual tears. Was that down to shock or something more? \nJust 11 days after Debora’s death, Lars was arrested for the killing of his wife. He was released on a $75,000 (£60,000) bail while awaiting trial. At the very least, his actions had been reckless. He’d fired a weapon without even calling out first. But would a jury think it was murder? Why would he want Debora dead? \nIn December 2015, Lars faced a jury – the same month Oscar Pistorius saw his culpable homicide verdict over-turned on appeal and was then convicted of murder.

Lars was emotional when he took the stand and tearfully testified about the events of that night. \n\"I heard whispers,\" he said under oath, adding there was a light that was moving too. \n\"Were you trying in any way to hurt your wife or were you trying to protect her?\" his lawyer asked. \n\"I was trying to protect her,\" Lars replied. \nThe prosecution said Lars’s behaviour was inconsistent with what a normal person would do if they thought an intruder was in their house. \nExperts said the shot was fired from three or four feet away. How had he not recognised his wife? The prosecutor was in disbelief. \n\"I know if it’s me and I see my wife’s shadow, I know it’s her,\" he said. \nLars claimed that the lighting was poor that night, but a friend testified that he’d stayed with the couple before and had easily moved around the house without any lights on. And why didn’t he have blood on his hands if he’d been trying to stop his wife bleeding to death? Intent to kill \nThe defence was clear in their closing arguments. \n\"He had absolutely no intent – none,\" they stated. \"And manslaughter? It was not reckless. If you agree, it ends right there.\" \nWhen it came to motivation, the prosecution suggested that Lars was tired of living in the shadow of his successful wife. Even when it came to Debora’s will, Lars wasn’t a beneficiary of her assets – only the house, which would be shared with her parents. \nThe prosecutor said that whatever the motive, intent to kill was clear. \n\"You don’t fire a weapon unless you intend to kill someone,\" he said. \nAfter tough deliberations, the jury found Lars guilty of murder, but convicted him of manslaughter. He could remain free on bail, but the judge warned that he faced a hefty sentence. \n\"Mr Itzo, you need to understand that if you do something silly, the consequences will not be good,\" he said. \nA week later, emotions ran high at the sentencing. Debora’s mother Anne looked directly at Lars from the stand and told him a fitting punishment would be a gun fired at him. \n\"You put a hole in her chest and it changed my life forever,\" she said. \nDebora’s father Jim said his daughter had a spirited personality and was full of life. \n\"I think she was one of those people who could tell you to go to hell and you’d joyfully enjoy the trip,\" he said. \nLars was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $10,000 (£8,000). Whether he intended to kill his wife or it really was simply an accident, there’s no question it was a tragic shot in the dark.
