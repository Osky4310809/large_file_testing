Two U.S. officials said Tillerson planned to visit Moscow on April 12. \n\"It feeds this narrative that somehow the Trump administration is playing footsy with Russia,\" said one former U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. \n\"You don't want to do your early business with the world's great autocrats. You want to start with the great democracies, and NATO is the security instrument of the transatlantic group of great democracies,\" he added. \nAny visit to Russia by a senior Trump administration official will be carefully scrutinized after the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday publicly confirmed his agency was investigating any collusion between the Russian government and Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign. \nTrump has already antagonized and worried NATO allies by referring to the Western security alliance as \"obsolete\" and by pressing other members to meet their commitments to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. \nLast week, he dismayed British officials by shrugging off a media report, forcefully denied by Britain, that the administration of former President Barack Obama tapped his phones during the 2016 White House race with the aid of Britain's GCHQ spy agency. show chapters Thursday, 16 Feb 2017 | 1:08 AM ET | 01:39 \nA former NATO diplomat said he hoped there might be a way for Tillerson to attend both meetings, for example by changing the date of the NATO talks. \nThe former diplomat, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was vital to present a united front toward Moscow. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 to serve as a bulwark against the Soviet Union. \n\"Given the challenge that Russia poses, not just to the United States but to Europe, it's critical to engage on the basis of a united front if at all possible,\" the diplomat said. \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .
