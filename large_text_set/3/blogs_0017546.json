Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMost players are content to use the PlayStation VR headset for video games, thanks to a raft of excellent titles for Sony's PlayStation 4 . \nBut a few have figured out how to use the £350 gaming accessory to see something a lot naughtier in 360 degress. \nThe Sony PlayStation store is firmly controlled by the Japanese company and - like Apple and Google - expressly forbids pornography from appearing. \nBut thanks to an app called Littlstar, gamers have found a way to side-load virtual reality content onto the console.
