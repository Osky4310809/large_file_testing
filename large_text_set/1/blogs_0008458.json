However, those is key positions, like the head of the NNSA, are often asked to continue serving in their roles until a replacement is found and confirmed by the Senate. (For President Barack Obama’s first term and into part of his second, the NNSA Administrator remained a Bush appointee.) \nTrump instructed Under Secretary for Nuclear Security Frank Klotz and his deputy, Madelyn Creedon, whom were both appointed by Obama, to leave their posts, even if it means no one will be in charge of maintaining the nation’s nuclear weapons. \n“It’s a shocking disregard for process and continuity of government,” the source told Gizmodo , adding that it could take months until the positions are filled.

That is a stumble for Trump, since he promised to expand the country’s nuclear capacity. \nRosner noted that Trump’s promised expansion is “a perfect example of Trump basically being clueless.” \n“He didn’t understand that we have a refurbishment program,” Rosner told Gizmodo. “He didn’t understand that, under Obama, that we’d rebuilt the entire production complex. So exactly what he would mean by ‘strengthening the nuclear program,’ it’s a bit of a mystery. I don’t know what he’s talking about. We’ve done it already.” Join the Discussion Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology. \nThe IBTech Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.
