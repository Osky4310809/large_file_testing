Along with US officials, they have claimed Mr Kim was assassinated by North Korean agents acting on behalf of the c ountry's lead er. \nMr Kim had previously spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of isolated, nuclear-armed North Korea. \nHe is said to have written a letter to his brother begging him to spare his life following an alleged assassination attempt against him in 2012. \nThe latest arrest came as North Korea said it would categorically reject the autopsy report on the death of Mr Kim. \nIt also accused Malaysia of \"colluding with outside forces\" after its request for them not to carry out the autopsy and immediately release the body was ignored.
