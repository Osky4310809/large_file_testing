Only John Terry (against Fulham in April 2013) and Branislav Ivanović (against Aston Villa in March 2012) have managed to score two goals in a single Premier League game for the Blues. Not bad company, two of the greatest goal-scoring defenders in Premier League history, for Alonso. Man of the match @marcosalonso03 has just confirmed that was the first time he has scored 2 goals in a game #CFC — Lee Parker (@Leeparker_tv) January 14, 2017 \nNo one expected this, least of all Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri. \n\"We were expecting something special from Hazard, Pedro or Willian and maybe we didn't expect Alonso to score the goals. But that's football when you play against big champions.\" -Claudio Ranieri; source: Leicester City \nRanieri was hardly alone in his praise for the Chelsea left wing-back , who's put recent criticisms and a potentially nagging leg injury firmly behind him with this most impactful performance — especially in the absence of Diego Costa and his expected goals. Maybe he was spurred on by the potential competition from Nathan Aké. Perhaps he just got lucky. Either way, it was quite fantastic. 6th minute first half, 6th minute second half ⚽️⚽️ good effort @marcosalonso03", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T11:19:46.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
