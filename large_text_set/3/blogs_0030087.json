Tying social media to the big picture by linking it to organizational and departmental goals will help you achieve that. \nIf you need some help determining goals, we recommend using the S.M.A.R.T goal framework. Explained in more detail through our piece Don’t Just Create Social Media Goals—Reach Them , you want to ensure that the goals you are setting are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely. \nFor example, rather than simply saying that you want to increase your engagement, set a numerical value and a deadline for this, such as aiming to have 50 customer interactions per week by the end of your first quarter. \nAs outlined in our post 7 Social Media Metrics that Really Matter—and How to Track Them , the following are specific social media goals, and the metrics to measure for each, to get you on the right track with your social ROI efforts. Goal No. 1: Increase social media engagement Basic social media metrics to measure : likes, shares, comments, retweets, mentions, and favorites Advanced social media metrics to measure : Bounce rate, social share of voice, amplification rate, and applause rate Goal No. 2: Increase customer acquisition on your website Basic social media metrics to measure : URL clicks and traffic from social media Advanced social media metrics to measure : Share of traffic driven and leads generated Goal No. 3: Increase brand awareness Social media metrics to measure : Follower growth rate, percentage change over time in followers, Twitter sentiment, reach by region and clicks by region Advanced social media metric to measure : Conversation rate How to measure your ROI \nWhile it’s great to set social media goals and act on them, your job isn’t done until you’ve proven the value of your efforts, which is a challenge for many social media and content marketers. \nAccording to the CMO Survey, social media spending increased 234 percent from 2009 to 2017 , accounting for 11.7 percent of total marketing budgets. Still, only 20.3 percent of marketers say they are able to prove the impact quantitatively. 56 percent—an inability to tie social media to business outcomes 39 percent—a lack of analytics, expertise and/or resources 38 percent—poor tools 35 percent—inconsistent analytical approaches 30 percent—unreliable data \nWhile it may seem difficult to prove these hesitations wrong, there are several tools available to help you. Social media ROI tools \nOnce you’ve established your social media goals, you’ll need the right tools and tactics for measuring results.

These reports will also present the data in a digestible way, allowing you to simply and effectively share your ROI on social media with higher ups in the organization. Check your metrics daily —You should check your various social media metrics frequently to ensure that your social media goals are being met. The lifecycle of a social media campaign is often very short, so you need to stay on top of the data as it happens. Stick to a timeframe —Choose a timeframe that works for you, and stick to it. You can often have reports sent to your email inbox on specific days of the week so you don’t even have to remember to pull reports yourself. Next steps: Make adjustments \nOnce you’ve identified what works and what doesn’t work for your organization on social, it’s time to adjust your strategy. The point of tracking your social media ROI isn’t just to prove your social campaigns are valuable, it’s to increase their value over time. \nGo back and take a look at the goals of your specific campaign and evaluate how they tie into the organization’s overall goals. \nDue to the short lifecycle of social media campaigns, a failing campaign should be changed and improved as soon as possible. Social media is never static. \nTo meet your social media ROI goals, you’ll need to update and adapt your strategy constantly . Take into account the analytics data you’re tracking. Think about whether your data needs adjusting after calculating your first round of social media ROI, and get back to the drawing board if necessary. \nThe setting of business goals and calculating your social media ROI is not going to be a black and white, one-time event, but rather an always-evolving process. \nMeasuring social media ROI gives your organization valuable insight into the success of current and past campaigns, and what might work in the future. \nProve the value of your social media efforts with Hootsuite Analytics.
