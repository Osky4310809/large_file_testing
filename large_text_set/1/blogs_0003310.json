There are so many names the WWE Universe would like to see given the honor, and a select few that are passionately debated each year. For instance, most believe Owen Hart is worthy of induction. After the events of last year, Chyna’s name is going to be heavily debated. \nHowever, there are many shoe-ins for a WWE Hall of Fame induction. For many former WWE Superstars, it is only a matter of time before they’re given the honor. They just need to wait for WWE officials to give them the green light. One name who’s been on the bubble for a few years now is the former WCW star, Diamond Dallas Page. It was rumored for most of 2016 that DDP would get his induction during Wrestlemania 33. \nIn fact, he recently discussed the possibility of a WWE Hall of Fame induction and had the following to say: \n“At some point, I’m sure it’s going to happen, I don’t know how it couldn’t but you never know,” said Page. “It’s not something I really focus on, I know that I should be in there but when it happens, it happens. It’s not a big deal.” [Image by WWE] \nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone or DDP himself that he is the first confirmed name for the Class of 2017 to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame this April in Orlando. “The Master of the Diamond Cutter” will be given WWE’s highest honor and his accomplishments inside and outside of the squared circle will be given the spotlight. \nHis accomplishments during his wrestling career in WCW is enough for an induction into the WWE Hall of Fame, but his work with DDP Yoga puts him over the top because he’s been able to influence the industry in such a unique way. He began developing the program back in 1998 during his recovery from ruptured discs in his back. Since then, it’s grown into a recognized brand that has helped so many people over the years. \nMost notably with WWE fans, Diamond Dallas Page and DDP Yoga have done wonders to change the lives of fellow WWE Hall of Famers such as Scott Hall and Jake Roberts , who have had a troubled history with substance abuse. Most recently, Diamond Dallas Page will be helping Vader with his health issues after it was revealed his life his winding down. DDP has been influential in their lives over the past few years. [Image by WWE] \nDDP Yoga has also done a great deal of good for the current WWE locker room. WWE Superstars such as AJ Styles, Chris Jericho, Mick Foley, and more have become advocates for the program. All of DDP’s success outside of the ring will be highlighted by WWE’s upcoming DVD called “ Diamond Dallas Page: Positively Living. ” The DVD will be released in March, which is just in time for his WWE Hall of Fame induction. \nThe future WWE Hall of Famer was also a three-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, a two-time US Champion, and the company’s fourth Triple Crown Champion. His run in WWE wasn’t as successful as his run in WCW, but he was also the first to debut on WWE television after the sale of WCW. \nFor his accomplishments in wrestling and outside of it, Diamond Dallas Page has been at the top of the list for a WWE Hall of Fame induction for a reason. Two nights before Wrestlemania 33 in Orlando later this year, he’ll be given the honor of becoming a WWE Hall of Famer. The only question is who will induct him? \n[Featured Image by WWE]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:05:31.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
