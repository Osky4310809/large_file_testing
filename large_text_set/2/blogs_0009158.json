One of those names was Fernando Llorente , the veteran Spanish striker who had worked with Conte at Juventus but now plays for Swansea in the Premier League. While there was plenty of smoke and noise, no move came to fruition as Diego, as well as back-up Michy Batshuayi, stayed put at Chelsea. January deals are always though, so now it’s back to the reality of a relegation scrap for Llorente. \"I already know Conte from Juventus. But it's difficult in the winter when there's a way out from a side you're playing for and it's normal that they didn't go ahead with the deal. I'm [now] very focused on [Swansea] and am looking forward to helping save us from relegation.\" -Fernando Llorente; Source: Daily Mirror With three wins in their last five games under new boss Paul Clement, Swansea have clawed their way off the bottom of the table and currently sit one point outside the relegation zone in 17th place. Llorente’s goals will be most important if they are to avoid sliding back down; there’s plenty of time for the Chelsea rumors to resurface later this summer.
