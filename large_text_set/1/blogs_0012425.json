Because we didn’t. And we also definitely didn’t know that the couple has two kids, Lola and the amazingly named Nakoa-Wolf, who like to get in a van, travel around the world, and do badass things like scale mountains with their shirts off? After a video (below) from their recent pilgrimage to the Spanish countryside has surfaced, we would now like to be invited on all of their future trips—or at the very least, thumb with envy through their family vacation photo albums. \nMomoa recently asked his buddy, bouldering guru Chris Sharma, to tag along with his fit family on their rock-climbing adventure in Savassona, Barcelona. We don’t pretend to know all the specifics of what goes on in this video, but if this clip is any indication, the Mamoa clan and Sharma hiked to some sick spots, ran in slow motion along the way, shed their shirts, and used their insane upper-body strength—kids included!—to climb lots of impressive-looking rocks and stake their claim on top, King of the Mountain-style. Sure as hell beats a family trip to Disney World. Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:00:50.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
