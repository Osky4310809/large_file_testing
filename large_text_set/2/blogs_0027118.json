They're the ones who scream at the coaches, put way too much pressure on their kids to succeed, and volunteer to be \"snack parent\" way more times than the other parents. But as crazy as those parents seem, there are some who just really, really don't know where to draw the line when it comes to being passionate about their kids' sporting lives (and that's the nice way of putting it). Check out some of the worst parents in youth sports' history below... The Dad Who Bit Part of a Coach's Ear Off \n(source) \nAfter his son's team lost their 6th grade basketball championship, Timothy Lee Forbes went over to the winning coach and punched him in the face before biting a chunk of his ear off. The coach permanently lost two inches of his ear, and Forbes was sentenced to four years in prison. The Dad Who Turned His Son's Helmet Into a Weapon \n(source) \nA dentist named Dr. Stephen Cito sharpened his son's football helmet's chin-strap so he could injure members of the other team when he played. After a few kids on the opposing team left due to receiving cuts on their faces, official investigated and found that Cito had used his dental tools to sharpen his son's helmet to the point were it could \"shred a magazine cover\". Cito was expelled from his high school, and his dad was given a weekend in prison, a year of probation and 400 hours of community service. But he was also still allowed to practice as a children's dentist? The Dad Who Tried to Poison His Son's Teammate \n(source) \nJerome Breland decided to poison his 12-year-old son's teammate because the kid allegedly wouldn't stop bullying him. He dropped some ipecac, which induces vomiting, into a water bottle and then told his son to give it to the bullying kid at practice. The plan worked and the kid did get sick, but the water bottle was passed around to other teammates, who also fell ill and were rushed to the hospital, and it wasn't long before it became obvious that something suspicious had taken place. Breland was caught and sentenced to six months house arrest and a year of community service. The Mom Who Flashed the Other Team So Her Son Would Win the Game \n(source) \nOne Toronto hockey mom was so determined to help her 11-year-old son win his game that she flashed the opposing team (and their parents on the other side of the rink) in order to distract them. While her plan worked and her son's team DID win, the moms on the opposing team complained and she was banned from attending games for a year. \nHave you ever experienced a batsh*t crazy parent at a sporting event?
