The Goddard Space Flight Center—where engineers and scientists who work on developing spacecrafts and other NASA technology—dropped a simply fire mixtape to celebrate some of Goddard’s greatest achievements of 2016. \nEnjoy it these sweet space beats while you can because in 2016, NASA discovered that our planet’s 2015 surface temperatures were the highest since 1880, when we began keeping record. Since 2001, every year (except one) broke this record.
