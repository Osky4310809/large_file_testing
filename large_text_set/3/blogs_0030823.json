Louise looked embarrassed as she confessed Dan had lost his coin (Photo: BBC) Her co-host was nowhere in sight (Photo: BBC) \n\"I have my pound coin… Dan has actually lost his pound coin – the first pound coin! Down the back of the sofa already,\" she said. \nJust then, Dan's head popped up behind the sofa looking embarrassed. \n\"I went for the first toss of the new pound coin to do a heads or tails thing and it disappeared down here somewhere,\" he said while searching the area on his hands and knees. There he is! (Photo: PA) Dan was on his hands and knees searching for the pound coin (Photo: PA) Louise struggled not to laugh as her hapless colleague searched the studio (Photo: BBC) \n\"Have you found it yet?\" laughed his co-host. \n\"Er, no,\" he added. \nLouise scrambled to wrap up the segment in time for the local news and weather – and just as the cameras were panning away, Dan shot his arm up and exclaimed in delight that he had finally found the miscreant coin. Got it! Dan finds the coin just in the knick of time (Photo: PA) \nIt's not the first time Dan's presenting has raised eyebrows among viewers. \nBack in October 2016, he was forced to defend his seating position after viewers pointed out that him sitting 'camera left' – on the left of Louise as seen on screen – could denote seniority, despite him having less experience than his co-host. \nHe told Daily Mirror's Square Eyes that it was less about that than about the height difference between him and Lou. Dan joined Louise on the red sofa last March \n\"When I was camera right in Louise's normal seat…this is going to sound stupid but there is a different bum dip in the sofa,\" he revealed. \n\"The studio is used but lots of different people and most people sit camera left so that part of the cushion is more depressed than the other side, so when I sat to the right it was like Bilbo and Gandalf, it looked ridiculous 'cos I looked huge and she looked quite small.\" \nBBC Breakfast is on weekdays from 6am on BBC1.
