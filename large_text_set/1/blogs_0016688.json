Cooper, USA TODAY Sports) \nA preview of the AFC Championship Game matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots \nWhen : Sunday, Jan. 22 \nWhere : Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Mass. \nLine : TBA \n1. Strength on strength : During Pittsburgh’s nine-game winning streak dating back to Week 11, the offense has excelled. Behind the QB-RB-WR trifecta of Ben Roethlisberger, Le’Veon Bell, and Antonio Brown, the Steelers have scored an average of TK points per game during the winning streak. New England’s defense, meanwhile, may not wow you with star power, but it led the NFL in the regular season in scoring (15.6 points per game allowed). Specifically, the matchups between New England corner Malcolm Butler and Brown, and Patriots linebacker Dont’a Hightower and Bell are worth watching. \n2. Rematch with one Big (Ben) tweak : Don’t put too much stock in Week 7’s 27-16 Patriots victory played in Heinz Field. Roethlisberger suffered a torn meniscus the week before against the Miami Dolphins and underwent a minor procedure to fix the issue. Backup Landry Jones started in his place and the Pittsburgh offense just wasn’t the same. \n3. Emerging X-factor : With tight end Rob Gronkowski out for the remainder of the season after undergoing back surgery, running back Dion Lewis has emerged as New England’s toughest matchup problem for opposing defenses. Against the Texans in the divisional round, Lewis became the first player in NFL postseason history to score touchdowns on a kick return, a catch, and a rush in the same game. He’s shifty, quick, elusive, and can’t be left in man-to-man coverage. Pittsburgh, however, has very athletic inside linebackers in Ryan Shazier and Lawrence Timmons, so the Steelers can get creative in their game plan against him. Facebook Posted!
