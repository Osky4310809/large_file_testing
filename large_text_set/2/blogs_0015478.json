Teaching children creationism, and that dinosaurs and humans co-existed, constitutes intellectual child abuse. \nHam’s Ark Encounter is a Christian fundamentalist project based on discredited science and a literal interpretation of Genesis. The life-size version of Noah’s Ark located in Williamstown, Ky., just south of Cincinnati, Ohio, is an exercise in Christian propaganda: a deplorable attempt to deceive children and others by denying the scientific reality of biological evolution and promoting Christian mythology as scientific fact. \nArk Encounter is dedicated to indoctrinating children with ridiculous and discredited claims from the dubious field of “creation science,” claims such as the earth is only 6,000-years-old, that human beings and dinosaurs lived on the earth at the same time, and that the story of Noah’s Ark is true. \nThe truth is that there is no scientific controversy concerning evolution. The assumption that creationism, or intelligent design, constitutes a legitimate scientific alternative to the theory of evolution is simply false. \nSimply put, creationism is not a legitimate scientific alternative to the theory of evolution. And preventing children from learning the truth about the world, like teaching children that creationism is an acceptable scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth, or that humans and dinosaurs existed on earth at the same time, is a form of child abuse. \nBottom line: Gladiator-style fights involving humans, giants, and a dinosaur are the stuff of fantasy, not science. By trying to teach children that creationism is a legitimate scientific theory Ken Ham’s Ark Encounter is engaged in a despicable form of intellectual child abuse .
