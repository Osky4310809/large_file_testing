From Brady to Matt Ryan to Roger Goodell, we crunch the numbers and give our predictions By Tyler Daswick February 6, 2017 Shutterstock Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers \nLots of people in the world had sex last night. Don’t be upset about that; it’s just a fact. People have sex all the time. Some of the sex is good and some of the sex is bad, but in the words of George Washington Carver, we think, sex is sex. Anyway, this means that some of the participants in last night’s Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons had sex last night, too. But who was it? It’s a great question, maybe even an important one, and we’re here to try and figure it out. From athletes like Tom Brady and Matt Ryan, to an exec like Roger Goodell, let’s see if we can guess who had sex last night. Tom Brady \nLikelihood This Person Had Sex: 98-percent likely. A Description of the Sex in Three Words: triumphant, vindictive, unprotected The Reasoning: Are you kidding? When Tom Brady went home to his perfect house last night, he put his two perfect kids to bed, made sure they were asleep, and then he and Gisele Bundchen, his perfect wife, went up to their perfect bedroom and had perfect sex all the way until morning. Their bodies shone like the sun on the summit of Mount Olympus, the legends tell. It was miraculous. You should’ve been there. Advertisement \nLikelihood This Person Had Sex: 17-percent (one for each completion) The Sex In Three Words: pitiful, pathetic, lustless Reasoning: Look, no one bangs the loser. You still can’t count out the possibility of pity sex, though. There’s always the chance for pity sex. Julian Edelman \nLikelihood This Person Had Sex: 85-percent The Sex In Three Words: energetic, dynamic, handsy Reasoning: He’s the star of the most gif-able moment in the game . Even his kinda gross mountain-man beard couldn’t kill his alluring postgame aura. Roger Goodell \nLikelihood This Person Had Sex: 0-percent A Description of the Sex In Three Words: It didn’t happen. Reasoning: Would you? \nLikelihood This Person Had Sex: ONE MILLION-PERCENT. A Description of the Sex In Three Words: multifaceted, crowded, loud Reasoning: Just take a look at the guy’s resume . Julio Jones \nLikelihood This Person Had Sex: 10-percent A Description of the Sex In The Three Words: robotic, alien, supernatural Reasoning: After he made this catch , we can only conclude that Julio Jones is an extraterrestrial creature sent to earth to game-break football. The side effect of this is that Julio Jones is much less likely to have postgame sex, because aliens as a whole are much less likely to have postgame sex. This is called science. Bill Belichick \nLikelihood This Person Had Sex: 666-percent A Description of the Sex In Three Words: demonic, hellacious, blood-soaked Reasoning: If he had time between his pagan skull ritual and his nightly bath in the blood of a thousand lambs, Bill Belichick probably had sex last night. He’s powerful and intelligent and his soul belongs to the ruler of Hades.
