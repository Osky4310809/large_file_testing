Obviously, because it’s an area where there are small children,” said Hurley. \nThe preschool, which has a fence surrounding the playground, decided to keep the kids inside for the day. \nSome of the kids were told they could not go outside because it was too cold. \nRachel Hammerle, who lives close to where the bobcat was spotted has two small dogs and two children. \n“I was shocked, we just moved here,” said Hammerle. \nShe says, she will take extra caution by “Leashing the dogs and keeping them inside especially at night.” \nBobcats are rarely seen as a threat to humans. “Bobcats are traditionally very shy,” said Hurley. \nThey prefer environments with swamps, bogs and brushy areas, which is the terrain behind the playground. \n“But it’s always a good idea to keep an eye on small pets and watch your children when they’re outside,” Hurley said. \nHurley cautioned residents to avoid leaving food sources outside like dog food bowls or pet food that would attract the attention of a bobcat. \nBobcats are common in central and western Massachusetts, according to the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:17:01.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
