After weeks of begging letters, I was interviewed for a “job” clearing out the props garage. Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders were there when I was waiting for the interview. I was so nervous, but knew I had to get it. I landed the two-day job and stayed for six years. \nIt was so prolific, with a muck-in, guerrilla attitude. After six years, I was developing a Stephen Fry radio pilot, and Keith Allen and I thought we should set up on our own. \nWhen I was a small kid, I used to dream of having an office with a spiral staircase, and I would come down in a blue silk suit to reception. When I finally set up my own company, I didn’t have the blue silk suit or a spiral staircase but it felt like I was doing what I always wanted to do. And setback? \nHaving started the company, I got a commission from Channel 4. I convinced my best friend, who was working as a chef, to come and join me. We rented an attic office but had no furniture — just some cushions on the floor and an old fax machine. Then the show was pulled. We huddled under a duvet that for some reason someone had brought into the office, and didn’t know what to do. \nYou have to pick yourself up, and a month later we got the gig producing Blur’s video for Country House. With the money we earned from that, we were able to buy some desks and chairs, and get started properly. Secrets of my success: Gerry Hughes, chief executive of GVA How do you juggle work and home? \nThe office is like a family — so many of us have known each other for years, we are proper friends. That said, I try to go to a remote Greek island, Patmos, as much as I can, and our whole family has wanderlust — I could travel forever. We went out to India at Christmas. I don’t get to go out to see much comedy, but my team reports back and I watch lots of TV and movies. Any tips for those starting out in your industry? \nRelationships with talent are key. Without them, you have nothing. You cannot rely on talent sticking with you benevolently, you have to work very hard so that they want to do their next project with you. \nBaby Driver will be released in the UK in June.
