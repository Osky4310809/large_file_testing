And while the mom-to-be can expect plenty of celebrations ahead of her babyâ€™s arrival, a gender reveal party wonâ€™t be one of them.\nâ€œWeâ€™re not finding out,â€ Port, 32, tells PEOPLE. â€œBut itâ€™s only one of two options, so itâ€™s not that crazy! Youâ€™re kind of prepared either way.â€\nAlthough the mom-to-be is excited about their decision to wait, she admits it does make nursery planning a little more difficult.\nâ€œItâ€™s made buying anything harder,â€ she says. â€œBut so many brands are gender neutral now, so I think you just buy the necessities and wait until you find out to buy the specific things.â€\nHaving baby on the brain hasnâ€™t slowed the fashion designer down a bit, with Port recently launching a disposable dishware collection with Cheeky . Thereâ€™s one to-do, though, that sheâ€™d rather not add to her list: planning a baby shower.\nâ€œI donâ€™t really want to organize it,â€ she says laughing, adding that her loved ones have expressed interest in throwing one for her. â€œIâ€™m thinking maybe some sort of coed barbecue, or something a little less traditional.â€\nFROM COINAGE:Â Your Go-To Guide to Finding the Right Wedding Gift \nÂ \nNontraditional seems to be Portâ€™s pregnancy mantra. She told PEOPLE that, â€œItâ€™s so important not to be pressured by what other people are doing or how people are parenting.â€\nMaking decisions with Rosenman and â€œcontinuing to stay trueâ€ to her style like keeping the sex a secret are a few of the ways sheâ€™s sticking to her instincts. But that doesnâ€™t make waiting to find out any easier.\nâ€œAt first I was like I really want a boy, they seem so much easier. And then now Iâ€™m like, I think I really want a girl,â€ she says. â€œSo you go back and forth but obviously at the end of the day all you want is a healthy baby, I donâ€™t care what I get.â€", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:10:21.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
