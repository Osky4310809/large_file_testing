Five others were convicted of crimes including rape, Information Minister Mahmud al-Momani told the official Petra news agency. \nThe group of 10 were part of the so-called \"Irbid terror cell\", which was responsible for several attacks. \nKing Abdullah II said in 2005 that Jordan aimed to become the first Middle Eastern country to stop carrying out executions, in line with most European countries. \nCourts continued to hand down death sentences but they were not carried out. \nBut public opinion blamed a rise in crime on the policy and in December 2014 Jordan hanged 11 men convicted of murder, drawing criticism from human rights groups. \nOpinion hardened after the murder by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group of captured Jordanian pilot Maaz al-Kassasbeh whose plane had crashed in a rebel-held region of Syria in December 2014. \nGrisly footage posted in February the following year of him being burnt alive in a cage outraged the public.
