The order can now be fulfilled by a Go-Car partner driver or a Blue Bird taxi, depending on which is available nearest to you. \nNo matter which picks you up, users still get the same fixed price as they would with Go-Car. They also retain the option to use Go Jek’s cashless payment system Go-Pay. \nThe initiative is the result of a partnership between Go-Jek and Blue Bird announced way back in May of last year. \nWhile the head of public relations for Blue Bird, Teguh Wijayanto, said at the time that they hoped their taxis could be ordered through the Go-Jek app by the end of the month, nothing materialised. \nThat was until yesterday, when Go-Jek app users were greeted to a pop-up announcing how Go-Car and Bluebird were joining forces. \nThe feature is currently only available in Jakarta though, with no word when it will become available in other parts of Indonesia. \nBlue Bird currently has its own booking app and about 30% of their bookings already come from online. \nThis agreement offers Blue Bird another online channel to attract customers, while giving Go-Jek access to the largest fleet of taxis in Indonesia. \nThe move comes shortly after a similar partnership was announced between ride-hailing company Uber and Indonesia's second-largest taxi operator, Express Group. \nThrough the scheme, Express taxi drivers can use the UberX service for bookings, while Uber drivers are able to lease vehicles without any taxi attributes or brandings through the Express Group. \nThese partnerships signal a new dynamic in the transportation service industry and a move towards greater reliance on online bookings for customers. \nTime will tell which partnership proves more successful, but consumers will likely be the main winners with these arrangements which should produce cheaper, more efficient transportation options for all in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:11:38.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
