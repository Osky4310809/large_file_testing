Working people don’t need a Democratic Party that speaks for them. They need a Democratic Party in which they can speak for themselves. T he 2016 election sounded a powerful wake up call for America. As Democratic leaders we know we have a responsibility to fight back against a Republican Party that seeks to return to an America where only a select and privileged few actually had a voice. “…to speak for themselves.” No one disputes that inspiring people is important. But those of us who were trained by Cesar Chavez know that he didn’t organize people with his iconic “Sí se puede” message. Cesar taught organizers to live by other words… “One by one by one”. One Voter at a Time. In 1994, California’s Republican Governor Pete Wilson’s assault on immigrants with Proposition 187 was the beginning of California’s deep blue birth. That ballot measure got us moving, organizing, winning locally — one race at a time. One new citizen at a time. Today, Latinos hold 27 of the 120 seats in the State Legislature. The majority of those districts are not “Latino majority”. African Americans hold 11 districts in the Legislature, and only three qualify under the old definition of a “Black” seat. There are those who say that what we did is some anomaly. To be dismissed with “Oh, that’s California”. My union, UNITE HERE, won Nevada. We took 150,000 houses, one house at a time. One new voter at a time. One new organizing drive at a time. In 2016, we sent the son of a union hotel housekeeper to Congress, elected the first Latina United States Senator, and put Democrats in charge of both houses of the Nevada State Legislature — not just by inspiring people. We dragged them to vote when they needed to be dragged. And just watch Arizona. While others flirt with it, we spent six years building Adios Arpaio. We registered tens of thousands of new voters and made citizens out of thousands of immigrants. We built that movement with high school kids. The sons and daughters of hotel and food service workers. The first of those kids are now out of college. And the new ones are just getting started. I will continue to be inspired by the hard work and dedication of our Democratic leaders. But I don’t think that any of this makes us special. I do think the work is special. It can and will be done wherever we decide to do it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:33:53.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
