Now Big Oaks looks to write a new chapter in its already varied history.\nThe Big Oaks Lodge has just hit the market , asking $449,000. The property’s 3,000 square feet of space includes a bar with a complete kitchen, a patio kitchen with grill and pizza oven, and three rental units on site. The buyer would also acquire the lodge’s Type 47 liquor license and catering license.\nBuilt in the 1920s as a rest stop for traveling stagecoaches, Big Oaks Lodge was a favorite of famed gangster “Pretty Boy” Floyd, actor W.C Fields, and Hollywood’s original power couple, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.\nBy the 1980s , things were a little rough and tumble at the Big Oaks Lodge. Afternoons were all about boxers and bikers, with motorcyclists guzzling brews at the bar, watching aspiring fighters train outside. No bouncers were needed, according to the bartender at the time, as he had a loaded shotgun and a German shepherd named Dukers to ward off trouble. Motorcycles would gradually disappear from the parking lot as the day waned, replaced with the cars of diners in search of classic American cooking. \nFor the next few decades, Big Oaks Lodge would continue to serve its biker and diner clientele, with the occasional film and TV shoot ( Beverly Hills 90210, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines ) adding a bit of Hollywood.\nThe Beverly Hills 90210 gang reacts to seemingly shocking news outside the Big Oaks Lodge. In late October 2016, a six-month road closure squeezed the lodge’s business. Just one week in, owner Diana White told the Santa Clarita Valley Signal, “The situation is dire.” It appears the dramatic decrease in traffic may have finally done it in. \nBuyer beware: The road is expected to remain closed until April 15.\n33101 Bouquet Canyon Rd [LoopNet] BIKER BAR TO THE CHAMPIONS : In a Leafy Glade, Men of Iron Fists Find Quiet Haven [LA Times] Road closure means big loss for Big Oaks Lodge [Santa Clarita Valley Signal] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:18:17.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
