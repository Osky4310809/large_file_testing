Personal space is a thing of the past! But not everyone likes to hug, and we have suffered in silence for too long. We aren’t weird, we just like to have a little goddamned breathing room. Here are six things people who hate hugging will understand. 1. People want to hug all the time \n(source) \nHugging has replaced the handshake in non-business situations (I assume. I am never in business situations, but I guess they still use handshakes). It’s getting ridiculous. Why is everyone pressing their bodies against everyone else's bodies all the dang time? I can't be the only one who finds that weird! 2. Hugging takes too long \n(source) \nThe process of hugging everyone is just silly and it takes way too long. If you’re in a group of six people and you hug everyone hello and goodbye, you’ve spent minutes just on greetings and farewells. It’s positively goofy. It’s one thing if I’m not going to see you again for a couple of years but if I’m going to see you again anytime soon, I don’t think we need to hug goodbye. I am a busy lady, I have listicles to write. 3. Handshakes and waves are perfectly good forms of greeting \n(source) \nHandshakes are a classic for a reason. They work! You meet someone or say hello, you don’t have to get all up in their personal space and vice versa. I happen to be a fan of the way under-rated wave. Just wave to someone while standing five or 10 feet away to say hello. 4. Pressing your body against someone else’s is way too private for strangers \nWhat’s next, open-mouth kissing everyone you meet? I don’t need to cradle your body in my arms, you complete stranger, and I don’t want you to feel my boobs. 5. Telling someone you don’t like to hug is weird \n(source) \nThere is no good way to avoid hugging someone you don’t want to hug. I try to give subtle hints that I don’t really want to go in for a hug by doing things like crossing my arms, slowly backing away, or conveniently throwing up on myself. I used to tell people that I don’t really like to hug but that’s apparently the equivalent of telling people you find them disgusting. Believe me, they’ll be weird about it. 6. Sometimes you’ll hug just because refusing to hug is weirder \n(source) \nWhen it comes to the awkward moment of hugging, I usually just deal with it. I’ve gotten much better at faking it over the years, to the point where I might not even look miserable. These are the concessions I make to live in society. Are they worth it? Time will tell. \nI don’t hate hugging everyone. I like hugging my girlfriend, and some of my best friends, and a few of my family members, and most cats and dogs. But in general, let’s please stick to the handshake. Do you hate hugs?
