As I said before, he is happy at Barcelona and has three years left on his contract.\" \nArda faces fierce competition for places at Barcelona, but he has made 29 appearances in all competitions this season. \nThose outings have delivered 13 goals, including hat-tricks against Borussia Monchengladbach and Hercules in Champions League and Copa del Rey contests.
