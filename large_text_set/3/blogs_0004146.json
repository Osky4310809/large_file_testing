UK has 'moral' duty to Gibraltar on Brexit \nFirst the Lords will consider backing other possible amendments to the bill, which authorises Theresa May to trigger Brexit. \nGovernment sources said the bill should simply be about invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, beginning formal negotiations. \nThe vote came after a heated debate in the Lords where the government was accused of treating EU citizens like \"bargaining chips\". \nMinisters attempted to stave off defeat, saying the issue was a priority for the government but should be tackled as part of a deal that also protected UK expats overseas. \nThe amendment backed by the Lords requires the government to introduce proposals within three months of Article 50 to ensure EU citizens in the UK have the same residence rights after Brexit. \nBut it could be overturned when MPs, who have already backed the Brexit bill without amendments, vote on it again. \nThe Department for Exiting the EU said: \"We are disappointed the Lords have chosen to amend a bill that the Commons passed without amendment. \n\"The bill has a straightforward purpose - to enact the referendum result and allow the government to get on with the negotiations.\" \nThe government said its position had \"repeatedly been made clear\", saying it wanted to guarantee the rights of EU citizens and British nationals \"as early as we can\". Now what? \nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg \nGovernment sources tonight sound relaxed. \nThey knew this vote was likely to go against them. And it's an issue that the government believes it has a clear defence on. \nIndeed, even during Theresa May's leadership campaign before she moved into Number 10, she articulated the same position. In her view, it would be unwise to guarantee the rights of the three million or so EU citizens in this country, before other EU countries are ready to do the same for British citizens abroad. \nFor her opponents that's distasteful, immoral even, because many people who have made their lives in the UK could be used, so the phrase goes, as \"bargaining chips\" in a negotiation. \nThere is little sign however of the government giving way despite the defeat. \nRead the rest of Laura's blog \nSpeaking after the vote, former Lords leader Lord Strathclyde said the vote represented \"wrong-headed and muddled thinking\". \nHe said it was difficult to see where a compromise between the government's position and that taken by the Lords could be found. \nBut Labour's shadow Lords leader Baroness Smith said there was a \"moral\", a \"legal\" and a \"pragmatic\" case in favour of guaranteeing EU nationals' rights. Media caption Baroness Smith: \"People are not bargaining chips\" \nSeven Conservative peers voted in favour of the amendment, which was proposed by Labour with the support of the Liberal Democrats. Media caption Lord Strathclyde: \"We've turned British citizens living in the EU into bargaining chips\" \nShortly after the Lords vote, MEPs in the European Parliament debated the status of EU migrants in the UK. \nJustice Commissioner Vera Jourova told MEPs that EU citizens in UK and British citizens elsewhere in the EU \"deserve to know that their rights will be\" after Brexit. \nShe said the matter should be addressed \"as soon as possible\" but that negotiations could only begin after the UK has triggered Article 50. The stages the Brexit bill needs to go through to become law: \n(It is currently at committee stage in the House of Lords) Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T06:30:18.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
