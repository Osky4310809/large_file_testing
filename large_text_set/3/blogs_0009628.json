By: FE Online | Published: March 14, 2017 12:02 PM Meanwhile, according to top US experts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emerged as a clear favorite for the 2019 general elections after the BJP’s landslide victory in assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. \nStating that the margin of victory for BJP is a very positive surprise, Andrew Holland, Avendus Capital Alternate chief executive on Tuesday told BTVi that he expects a more stable government and policy reforms going forward. Talking about GST he recently said that even as the economy is getting itself together post-note ban shock, the implementation of goods and services tax (GST) is also likely to cause serious disruptions. “Valuations are challenging. We are seeing early signs of pick-up from demonetization but it’s not a V-shape pick-up and will not be a V-shaped recovery” Holland said. “GST implementation has the real risk of again halting or having shock effects on the economy… these are the short-term challenges to the economy,” he added. “Large companies may understand how to implement GST but we are not so sure about small and medium enterprises,” he added. \nA day after the BJP’s spectacular victories in the recently held elections, PM Modi said the results in the five states indicated the emergence of “a new India”, where poor were not seeking sops but asking for opportunities to grow. “A New India is on the horizon. I am seeing the election results in the five states as a foundation for a New India — a New India of the dreams of 65 per cent population of under-35 youths and of uniquely aware women groups. A new India in which the poor are looking for an opportunity to do something instead of seeking something is a new change,” the PM said, in his victory speech at the BJP headquarters. The Prime Minister set 2022 as the target year for bringing in this New India. “I don’t live by-election calculations. My target is 2022, not 2019. 2022 will mark 75 years of India’s Independence. We have five years to contribute to change India,” said Modi. \n. @Hollaand : Margin Of Victory For BJP Is A Very Positive Surprise; Expect A More Stable Govt, Policy Reforms Going Forward pic.twitter.com/lVmdKCC41v \n— BTVI Live (@BTVI) March 14, 2017 \nMeanwhile, according to top US experts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emerged as a clear favorite for the 2019 general elections after the BJP’s landslide victory in assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. While one of the experts noted that the electoral results of the just concluded Assembly polls in five states show that the 2014 Lok Sabha election results were not an aberration, another noted that Modi would continue to lead India after 2019.
