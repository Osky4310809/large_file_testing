Russell Westbrook may be an emotional player but he did not mean for this to happen. He nailed the referee in the head with this pass and by default had to be called for a technical foul.\nWestbrook tried to beg and plead and say he didn’t mean to do it but this ref was not having it. The ref never smiled or said it was okay. He just stared at him like this the entire time.\nAfter this play and a couple of non-calls leading up to it, Russ rightfully needed a minute. \nWestbrook just went into the tunnel. He used to do that when he was overly steamed about something. Was very upset about last few minutes.\n— Royce Young (@royceyoung) January 5, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T03:07:54.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
