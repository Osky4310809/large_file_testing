Jurgen Klopp rejects the ideas Marco Van Basten has suggested to change football in the future. The ESPN FC panel share their thoughts on Marco van Basten's idea to have NASL-style penalties at the World Cup. \nThe German Football League (DFL) has backed Marco van Basten's plans to introduce sin bins. \nLast week, Van Basten, who is FIFA's chief officer for technical development, said rule changes are under consideration to make the game more attractive. \nAmong the proposals was to introduce a time penalty of five or 10 minutes and replace yellow cards to punish teams in a match rather than after a number of matches. \nThat idea has now been backed by DFL CEO Christian Seifert, who said : \"I think it makes sense that football adapts to the technical options we have these days. \n\"Sin bins make much more sense for the match than yellow cards.\" \nCiting the success of recent changes to the game like the introduction of goal-line technology or the use of vanishing pray have been a success, Seifert added that we could also see an \"automatised offside detection\" in the future. \nEarlier this week, the DFL announced plans to use video assistant referees (VAR) from next season . \nVAR will only be used for clear matters and in four separate situations -- for irregularities in the case of a goal decision, penalty box situations regarding penalty calls, red card offences unnoticed by the referee, and in cases of mistaken identity over a yellow or red card. \nStephan Uersfeld is the Germany correspondent for ESPN FC.
