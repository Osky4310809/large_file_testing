On the one hand, yes, it's theoretically possible that a group of rogue civil servants, probably concentrated in the intelligence community, have conspired to leak sensitive information to oust Flynn -- a man not terribly popular when he was a leader at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Perhaps these rogues will continue to undermine Trump further whenever they disagree with him, say, for example, on Russia policy -- or, more importantly, on the question of whether the Trump campaign had contact with the Russian government prior to the election. The administration could be thwarted at every turn from those in Deep Government, and something would have to be done. Or, more likely, Flynn was fatally flawed from the outset. His integrity problems, coupled with an abrasive management style and an overly cozy relationship with Moscow, simply made him a bad choice for the job. Trump's Russia crisis is just beginning (Opinion) But getting an answer from the President on this is like asking a teenager why they missed curfew: Flynn is a good man, but he lied; the press has been unfair to him, and he did nothing wrong, but I fired him, and the FBI is still investigating. Is it not more likely that President Trump is throwing out as much chaff as he can to distract from that which worries him the most? Trump's greatest insecurity is whether or not the results of the election were valid given reported collusion between his campaign and Russia to discredit his opponent. Perhaps the administration is using every storyline it can think up to save face. The current story is that rogue anti-Trump Democratic holdovers in the government are undermining Trump by leaking, and the \"fake press\" is creating false stories from those leaks. And Trump's administration, of course, is asserting this in order to avoid a full investigation of his campaign's alleged contact with Russia. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook It took three reporters in the recent press conference asking the same question, \"Did your campaign have any contact with the Russian government during the campaign?\" before the President answered, \"Not to my knowledge.\" Remember, this is a President who, when confronted with a false statement he made about the size of his margin of victory in the election, responded \"Well, that's just what I was told.\" So which is it? A vast, dark government conspiracy exerting unconstitutional control over the President and his policies using leaks? Or a White House in disarray and a President who desperately fears an investigation into his campaign's contact with Russia -- something that could undermine that which is most dear to him, his presidency? I know where I'd put my money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:58:16.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
