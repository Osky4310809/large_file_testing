They got kicked out of a food court, but not before showing pornography to a reporter. \nThe DC Antifascist Coalition had booked a room at the National Press Club to hold a press conference in which they would unveil damaging information about O’Keefe and his group Project Veritas. In the lead-up to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Project Veritas released videos which resulted in the arrest of a member of DisruptJ20 and foiled a plot to use stink bombs at an inauguration ball. (RELATED: Agitators Plan To Stop DC Subway Trains During Inauguration) \nThe DC Antifascist Coalition is affiliated with DisruptJ20, and they held the event to release “shocking new information on right wing operative James O’Keefe and his organization, Project Veritas.” The National Press Club, however, did not want the anti-fascist organization to use their facilities as they were concerned for our safety, according to DC Antifascist Coalition spokeswoman Lacy MacAuley. \nAnti-fascist affiliated “black bloc” protesters were involved in violent demonstrations at the inauguration and at the University of California – Berkeley riot Wednesday night. The activists now unable to use the press briefing room they booked moved to the food court of the National Press Building. \nOnce the few journalists covering the event were at the food court, MacAuley handed out document which gave information about spotting infiltrators and starting telling a long-winded story about her interactions with an alleged undercover Project Veritas reporter. \nMacAuley, however, was cut off by the food court’s security guard who said we couldn’t be holding a conference there and the space was reserved for eating. MacAuley and her associates convinced the guard that we could stay as we would just start eating around a long table and have an informal conversation. \nA few of the almost ten people present grabbed food, and it was liberal activist Daryle Lamont Jenkins turn to speak. Jenkins is the executive director of the One People’s Project, which seeks to expose white supremacists in the conservative movement. Jenkins proceeded to speak about a photo he released in 2010 of O’Keefe at a conference which included white nationalist Jared Taylor. \nJenkins decided to show this photo to the journalists present at the food court table and turned his iPad around horizontally. This reporter was seated across Jenkins when he turned his iPad around and the photo of O’Keefe became a thumbnail in Jenkins’ downloads folder surrounded by dozens of thumbnails of pornographic videos. \nJenkins showed off his porn collection for around 20 seconds before turning his iPad back towards him and exclaiming, “What the hell?” Most of the thumbnails appeared to be of white women in compromised positions. Jenkins went on to talk about his efforts to “beat back” racists in American society. \nAfter the black activist spoke, it was Jason Charter’s turn, who claims he was beaten after infiltrating a New York event O’Keefe was speaking at. Charter did not get to speak for long as the security guard told us our time was up and we had to leave to the food court. \nThe Daily Caller asked Jenkins after the event if the other thumbnails on his iPad’s downloads folder were indeed porn, and he nervously denied that this was the case. Jenkins said that they were videos he had shot himself on his device. When TheDC asked to see them again, Jenkins said he wouldn’t show them because he claimed the videos were of protests, and some of the people in them wouldn’t want to be seen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:53:50.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
