Her new cookbook, Food, Health, and Happiness: 115 On-Point Recipes for Great Meals and a Better Life , dropped yesterday (yes, when you're Oprah, a cookbook is as cool as a record album) and is already in the top spot on Amazon's \"U.S. Regional Cooking, Food & Wine\" category. \nThe tome includes 115 recipes, including dishes such as miso-glazed cod, sexy breakfast (whatever that means), and \"unfried\" chicken. \nThe book also includes personal memoirs and anecdotes, and apparently heavily features the Weight Watchers program (Oprah is both an investor and a spokesperson for the brand), including WW \"points\" for each meal, along with calorie counts. — Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) January 3, 2017 \nIn a statement to People Oprah said, \"When I come upon something useful, something that brings me pleasure or comfort or ease, I want everyone else to know about it and benefit from it, too. And that is how this cookbook came to be. It's my life story — the lessons I've learned, the discoveries I've made — told through food.\" \nThe cookbook retails for $22.70 hardcover on Amazon and, even though the Christmas season is over, chances are it's already one of her favorite things .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:11:24.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
