This video shows you how to clean them to keep them in proper working condition. \nThere's nothing worse than a tripod that gives you the business when you're trying to level a shot, perform a smooth pan, or simply just trying to pack it up. When things like sand, dirt, and grime get into a tripod's nooks and crannies, it not only makes operating much more difficult, but it could potentially render it completely useless. In this video, Troy Nikolic shows you the best way to clean and maintain a tripod. \nCleaning a tripod is relatively straightforward in terms of what you'll need to clean it: some water, a toothbrush, and a silicone based lubricant, like WD-40. The thing that may give you pause is the thought of having to completely disassemble your tripod, and with all of those tiny parts I don't blame you. \nHowever, it's important that every piece of your tripod is getting thoroughly cleaned of debris and build-up in order to make sure that it's able to move free of obstruction. And if you're afraid you won't be able to put it back together once you tear it down, just make sure you're organized when you do it. Lay down a white sheet so you can see all of the pieces. Remove pieces systematically so you can keep a mental map of where everything goes. Lay each piece down in an organized fashion so you won't miss anything when reassembling. \nThen, once you successfully clean it and put it back together, your tripod is going to feel like new, especially if you're cleaning it for the first time after years of loyal service. \nDo you have any tips on cleaning tripods?
