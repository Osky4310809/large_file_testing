The one whom we came closest to signing was Celtic veteran Craig Gordon, but the 34-year-old eventually decided to stay, with rumors of Celtic offering him a new and improved deal starting up at the same time as well. However, according to the Daily Mail , negotiations between the Bhoys and Gordon's representatives regarding a new deal have reached an impasse and thus have been put on hold until the end of the season. Even though Gordon's contract is set to expire at that time, Celtic’s option for a one-year extension gives them leverage in both negotiations and against any other team bidding for the goalkeeper’s services. Since Begovic's plans to leave the club as soon as he gets the opportunity seem to have not changed, Gordon should remain an option as a future backup goalkeeper at Stamford Bridge. Although a £3.5 million transfer fee, which was supposedly Chelsea’s final offer in January, for a 34-year-old keeper sounds a bit steep, he would be a good name to fill in Begovic's shoes.
