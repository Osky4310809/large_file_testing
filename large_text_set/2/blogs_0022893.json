This is not Trump’s America.” \nAs other passengers start cheering, the woman recording the video says: “Goodbye, racist.” \nJonathan Guerin, a United Airlines spokesman, told The Washington Post : “We removed two passengers for making others feel uncomfortable on the flight and for saying some inappropriate things to customers on the flight. \n“Most customers appreciate a place where they feel safe and where they’re not going to be attacked and we want to provide that.” \nTrump has been blamed for the rise in Islamophobic hate crime in the US in recent months. \nThe number of anti-Muslim hate groups in the country has nearly tripled since 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center said, with the number of groups increasing from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016, the Associated Press reports. The number of hate groups overall tracked by the watchdog group also increased to 917 last year from 892 the previous year, the report said. “2016 was an unprecedented year for hate,” said Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center. The report blamed the increase in part on “incendiary rhetoric” from the campaign of Trump, which included threats to ban Muslim immigrants and “mandate a registry of Muslims in America.” It also cited as factors “the unrelenting propaganda of a growing circle of well-paid ideologues” - well-paid employees of anti-Muslim groups, the group said - and radical Islamist attacks such as the June 2016 massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.
