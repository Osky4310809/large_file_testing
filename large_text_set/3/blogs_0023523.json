( The one that’s not mid-engined !) Thanks to a couple of eagle-eyed members of the Corvette Forum blog, you can now see the Corvette ZR1 on the move—and quickly—at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. More important, you can hear the beastly ’Vette, and it sounds wicked. \n-The cluster of videos, posted to YouTube and later to Corvette Forum by users Skank and SBC and a Stick, show ZR1 prototypes ripping around Laguna Seca, as well as the creative possibilities of forum avatar naming.
