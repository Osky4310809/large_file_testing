But he has since come into his own right as an iconoclastic architect, designing a slew of Mill Valley homes. This unique midcentury-modern gem in Mill Valley, for example, he completed at the age of 28. \nThe curvy, circular-shaped house is similar to the dwelling for which Liebermann is most famous, the Radius House also in Mill Valley. Owned by the same family for 50 years, 861 Lovell Avenue will return to the market next week asking a cool $2,795,000.\nConstructed primarily out of old-growth redwood trees and glass, the main house features two bedrooms and two and a half baths. There’s also a one-bed, one-bath guest house.\nThe construction is filled with exposed beams, brick, wood work, and arches. A refreshing change for anyone suffering from Eicher overload.\nAnd Heath Ceramics stans should take note—the kitchen, baths, swimming pool and fountain all furnished with original Heath tile. Gorgeous.\nA bit of an eccentric, Lieberman, who died in 2015, was an unconventional thinker. According to a profile in the Point Reyes Lighthouse , “He would comport himself in layers of wool clothing during summer heat, and kept a trove of artifacts—including old cars—at his home in Inverness.”\nWhen asked about his architectural philosophy in 2011, he said, “I see buildings as a very dynamical static bundle of forces.”\n861 Lovell Avenue [Marin County Real Estate] Daniel Liebermann, architect, dies at 84 [Point Reyes Lighthouse] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:41:25.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
