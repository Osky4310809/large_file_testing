Antonio Trillanes IV will attend the hearing of the Commission on Appointments (CA) today to oppose the confirmation of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II. \nThe ad interim appointment of Aguirre was initially taken up two weeks ago and would have been finished if not for the intervention of Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto. \nRecto chided his colleagues from the CA for railroading the confirmation of Aguirre when there was a senator and member of the minority bloc who has raised questions about the fitness of Aguirre to hold the post of justice secretary. \nAt the time, Trillanes could not attend the confirmation hearing because he was out of the country. \nFor today’s hearing, Trillanes said that he would be around to oppose Aguirre’s confirmation. \n“I will attend and I will push for the rejection of the appointment,” Trillanes said.   \nTrillanes opposed the confirmation of Aguirre over his supposed “lack of required demeanor befitting the position of the secretary of justice.” \nHe said that Aguirre has demonstrated that he is vindictive, vengeful and completely lacks the required equanimity for him to be entrusted with the power and authority of the government as secretary of justice. When Aguirre called Trillanes a gagong senador (stupid senator), the senator said that it showed his total lack of respect for him as an elected representative of the people and the Senate as an institution as well. \nAside from Aguirre, the CA will also take up the appointment of Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo today. \nIsabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano III, who is CA majority leader, said there is no opposition to Taguiwalo’s confirmation. – With Jess Diaz  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:00:38.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
