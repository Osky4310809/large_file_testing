In a medium saucepan, heat coconut oil over medium heat until melted and warmed. Add turmeric, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom and stir. Cook for 30 seconds. Stir in oats and toast for another 30 seconds. \n2. Add water and milk and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, add maple, and cook for another 10 to 15 minutes stirring occasionally. The liquid should be absorbed and the texture creamy. Feel free to add more water or liquid if the oats are a bit on the drier side (this will depend on your oats). \n3. Serve with desired toppings. Breakfast Baked Sweet Potato Photo credit: Leah Vanderveldt \nBake a batch of whole roasted sweet potatoes at the beginning of the week for quick and hearty meals throughout the week. \nServes 1 1 small to medium sweet potato, baked olive oil, avocado oil, or grass-fed butter 1 egg 2 large handfuls of cleaned and roughly chopped greens (spinach, kale, or arugula all work great) ¼ to ½ an avocado, cut into small pieces Salt and pepper \nPreparation \n1. To bake sweet potato, heat the oven to 415°F. Poke sweet potato with a fork a few times and place on the oven rack. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour (this will depend on the size of your sweet potato) until softened. \n2. When you're ready to serve, heat enough oil or butter to cover the base of a small pan over medium heat. Crack egg into the pan and cook for about 5 minutes, until the whites are cooked through and firm. (Alternatively, feel free to scramble your eggs or poach them.) \n3. Meanwhile, warm your sweet potato if it's not already. Slice in half lengthwise, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil or some grass-fed butter. When egg is finished cooking, place on top of the sweet potato. \n4. In the same pan as the egg, add a little more oil or butter over a medium heat and toss in the greens. Stir and cook until just wilted (this should take only a minute or two). Add to sweet potato and serve with avocado and more salt and pepper as needed.
