Garlic and olive oil don’t make it a hummus. This is just a tasty bean dip!

Advertisement \nLike “fake news,” the meaning of hummus has been stretched and contorted to the point where it’s lost a clear definition. Let’s be clear: Chocolate hummus is not hummus. That is a chocolate spread that happens to have chickpeas in it. If that’s what you want to eat, that’s your right, but please do not besmirch the name of hummus. \nCould this be a lack of distinction between hummus and tahini? That’s my only guess. Tahini’s a sesame paste, and a versatile ingredient that can be used for a confection like halawa. If you wanted to make a sweet spread, you would use that, but—again—it would not be “dessert hummus.” Personally, I blame the whites. \nHere’s a reliable recipe for hummus. It’s great because it has only two steps, and one of them is optional.
