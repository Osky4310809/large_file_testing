The former Trump campaign manager answered that Trump has agreed to receive intelligence briefings before moving on to criticized President Barack Obama. \nAfter wondering why Obama didn’t act as harshly against China for its hack in 2015, and dismissing the notion that Russia weaponized their hacks, the discussion moved on to North Korea and trump’s response to the news that the country was looking to build a ballistic missile to reach the US. \nAfter Cooper read the tweet, which made it appear that the United States will go it alone in stopping North Korea, he asked what steps Trump panned on taking. When Conway pivoted to talking about the Iran Deal, Cooper interrupted. \n“So what will he do,” Cooper asked. \nConway would then respond that the incoming POTUS will meet with his national security team and that he will not “sit idly by.” \n  CNN. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T04:00:21.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
