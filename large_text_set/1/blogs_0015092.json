Samsung Tips Profit Leapt 50 Percent Despite Galaxy Note 7 Fiasco \nThe results of the investigation will likely be announced on Jan. 23, a day before it announces detailed fourth-quarter earnings results, said the person, who was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter and declined to be identified. \nKoh Dong-jin, head of Samsung's mobile business, will likely announce the results as well as new measures the firm is taking to prevent similar problems in future devices, the person said. \nA Samsung spokesman declined to comment. \nSamsung initially announced a recall of some 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones in September and identified the cause of the fire as a manufacturing process problem at one of its suppliers, later identified as affiliate Samsung SDI Co Ltd. \nBut new Galaxy Note 7s with what Samsung said were safe batteries from a different supplier continued to catch fire, forcing the company to permanently halt sales of the device and dealing a 6.1 trillion won ($5.2 billion) blow to Samsung's operating profit over three quarters. \n\"To me it'd be surprising if they said it was a supplier issue,\" IDC's Ma said, adding he suspects Samsung may not have given enough room for the battery inside the phone. \nThe company in October said it will examine all aspects of the phone , including hardware design and software, and would hire third-party firms as part of its probe. \nThe source told Reuters on Monday that Samsung was able to replicate the fires during its investigation and that the cause for the fires could not be explained by hardware design or software-related matters. \nWhile prospects for its smartphone business this year remain a major question mark for Samsung, profits are expected to rise sharply on the back of rising memory chip prices and growing sales of organic light-emitting diode screens for smartphones. \nÂ© Thomson Reuters 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T06:16:51.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
