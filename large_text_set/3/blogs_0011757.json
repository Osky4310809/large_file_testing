Its road safety spokesman Pete Williams said: “This is an own goal from Gary Neville which is made all the more disappointing as he is someone who is seen as both a role model and a national hero. \n“The fact it comes within a few days of the penalties for the offence doubling makes it even worse. \n“This must serve as a wake-up call for every individual not to use their handheld mobile at the wheel. No call, tweet, post or photo on a handheld phone is worth it.” Gary Neville pictured driving on the motorway with his phone in his hand (Photo: DAILY MIRROR EXCLUSIVE) \nSky Sports football pundit Neville, 42, was pictured on the M60 in Worsley, Greater Manchester, by a passenger in another car. \nHis luxury motor appears to be a Bentley Bentayga, which are worth at least £135,000 and come with Bluetooth mobile phone capability. \nWhile it is not clear what he is doing, he is still a ­potential danger as he appears to have only one hand fully on the wheel.

It’s an unusual car and you don’t see many about. As we went to overtake we realised it was Gary Neville. \nMy mate who was driving said, ‘Get a photo.’ So I did and Neville gave me a dirty look, a real dirty look. \n\"I didn’t know why, then when I saw the video I ­realised why… he was holding his mobile. Neither of us are Manchester United fans. But that had nothing to do with it.” The former England star can be seen holding his phone while driving (Photo: DAILY MIRROR EXCLUSIVE) \nThe Mirror approached Neville’s representatives who contacted him and said he would not comment. \nLast November, the former defender – who owns a hotel – was pictured using his phone at the wheel of his BMW in Manchester. \nWe launched a campaign last year to stop drivers using mobiles on the road.
