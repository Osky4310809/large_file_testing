From X-Men: The Last Stand to X-Men: Days of Future Past , the franchise has been riddled with continuity errors that keep eagle-eyed fans on their toes. \nMoving forward, the X-Men franchise is set to undergo a sort-of overhaul as it regroups in the wake of Logan . The R-rated flick made its stand in theaters last weekend as moviegoers flocked to see Hugh Jackman’s final role as Wolverine. The critical darling is already making bank at the box office, and plenty of fans are wondering how the franchise’s future will knit its continuity back together. \nHowever, it looks like the X-Men movies are not all too worried about its timeline blips. In a recent interview with Deadline , a noted producer from the franchise took time to talk about the series’ future, and Simon Kinberg said things can only connect when done so organically. \n“There is a larger architecture to tell these stories in. I talk to the studio all the time about this and there is a plan for how these movies can connect and be a part of a larger narrative,” Kinberg said. \n“It’s something that’s fun, exciting and it will be interesting to see how we marry the different tones that we’ve been generating in these standalone movies of the X-Men universe. But we go into making the best movie we can. It’s not just about a Colossus or Deadpool cameo. Connecting all of these movies will happen when it organically makes sense. These movies aren’t simply being built as stepping stones to a larger story. Each one is wholly enclosed and a movie worth seeing.” \nFor fans, the news may come as a surprise. In the world of superhero films, Marvel Studios has made a name for itself because of its heavily interconnected films. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a massive beast spanning more than a dozen films, and it only plans to grow. As for DC Entertainment, the studio is also working to create its own cinematic universe that’s strung together by heroes such as Batman and Superman. \nAs for 20th Century Fox, the studio may want to distance itself from the other companies and their formula. While interwoven narratives can still take place, Fox has found a nice niche with its R-rated features. If it can work magic with the sequels to Deadpool and X-Men: Apocalypose , the studio may reach a place where it can establish a more stable timeline to base a cinematic universe upon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:22:49.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
