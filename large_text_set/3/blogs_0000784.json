If you reach her cervix during sex, recognise that something is wrong. Remember, this is the narrow canal that connects the vagina to the uterus—where babies grow. That isn’t a place you want to go; so, don’t knock on the door. For starters, it’s painful for her to have something rammed against her cervix, and it could be a sign that you need to shift for a position with shallower penetration. But it could also mean that she isn’t warmed up enough. Her uterus will actually “lift” upwards when she’s sexually aroused, making her vaginal cavity a few inches deeper than when she isn’t turned on. So, don’t skimp on foreplay, and don’t service her cervix. \n• The head of her clitoris. This might seem counter-intuitive, but the clitoris — which is full of super sensitive nerve endings — can sometimes feel too intense when it’s stimulated directly. Touching the clitoris head-on, especially if she’s really aroused, can feel too severe. Think about that feeling when you gulp an ice-cold beverage and your teeth start to tingle — it’s just not pleasant. Instead, try going for the shaft of her clitoris or rubbing circles around it, which will engage the nerve endings without overstimulating her. We won’t tell you to never touch her there, but it’s worth checking in with your partner to see if she has a sensitive C-spot. \n• Her feet. Especially if she’s wearing socks. A study from Johns Hopkins University showed that wearing socks during sex can increase orgasm potential for both men and women. One potential reason: In order to orgasm, women need to be totally relaxed and anxiety-free, and cold feet can interfere with their ability to really get into sex. \n• Her anus. Don’t touch her anus unless you’re fully lubricated! Anal play can take plenty of warming up, but even when she’s totally aroused and ready to get it on, nothing should go in there without a generous helping of lubricant. The anal opening is small enough that even a finger can feel uncomfortable. A study from the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that women rate their sexual satisfaction much higher when lubrication is involved.
