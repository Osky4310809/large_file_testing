Trump has suggested he could ease the sanctions on Russia if the Kremlin cooperates on his policy priorities. Scaramucci confirmed the Davos meeting. \nIn an interview with the Russian state news agency TASS Tuesday, he also criticized the sanctions as ineffective. Trump’s view about Russia is that “there’s probably shared values or shared interests, that we can align ourselves with each other and this could be mutually beneficial,” he said. \nAnthony Scaramucci at Davos, Jan. 17. Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg \nThe two sides didn’t disclose details of the meeting, which Scaramucci said took place Monday evening. \nDmitriev’s fund said it’s organizing a visit by a delegation of top U.S. corporate executives to Russia and plans to open a representative office in New York in May. In an interview last week, Dmitriev said the visit would be aimed at highlighting the benefits of closer economic ties and could take place as early as this spring. The current U.S. administration has discouraged American business from working with the Kremlin in the wake of the sanctions it imposed after the Russian intervention in Ukraine starting in 2014. \nSpeaking to Bloomberg Television Tuesday, Scaramucci said he’s long known Dmitriev and worked with him to set up the business delegation as a private citizen. “The idea was, many months ago, to have more outreach with Russia,” he said, noting that he will have to determine whether he can continue from within the administration, given ethics rules. ‘Eat Snow’ \nSpeaking on a panel in Davos, Scaramucci said Trump has tremendous respect for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
