This is what they found: Iseng-iseng googling alamat FPI, eh keluarnya alamat DPP Fitsa Hats Jakarta Pusat. — Wicaksono (@ndorokakung) January 9, 2017 \nToday, Google apologized for the error and attributed it to there being a system in Google Maps that allows users to input information to specify locations. \n“On the whole, our data is comprehensive and up-to-date. But we realize that there’s always a possibility for inaccuracies to arise out of [third party] sources,” said a Google Indonesia representative to Detik today. \nGoogle says that they have people working on fixing the error. True enough, a search for the FPI headquarters no longer shows the location for “Fitsa Hats”. However, as of 10 am today, a search for “Fitsa Hats” still leads to the location of the FPI headquarters in Central Jakarta. \nThe Fitsa Hats meme was created last week after Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama pointed out that Habib Novel Bamukmin, FPI Jakarta leader and “witness” in his blasphemy trial, wrote in the personal profile section of his official court document that he once worked at Fitsa Hats. Ahok alleged that Novel deliberately made the typo because he was too embarrassed to admit that he worked for Pizza Hut, a restaurant chain based in the USA (and thus run by non-Muslims).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T10:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:50:11.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
