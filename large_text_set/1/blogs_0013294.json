President-elect #DonaldTrump to nominate former Gov. Sonny Perdue for Secretary of Agriculture https://t.co/MGXEMt12dA \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 19, 2017   FBI, Intelligence Agencies Looking At Possible Ties To Kremlin, Trump Campaign, Report Says \n“Beginning as a simple Georgia farm boy , making sure Americans who make their livelihood in the agriculture industry are thriving is near and dear to my heart, and I’m going to champion the concerns of American agriculture and work tirelessly to solve the issues facing our farm families in this new role.” \nPerdue, a former Democrat, served two terms as governor, from 2003 through 2011. The 70-year-old was born on a farm and is a former veterinarian. \n“From growing up on a farm to being governor of a big agriculture state, he has spent his whole life understanding and solving the challenges our farmers face, and he is going to deliver big results for all Americans who earn their living off the land,” Trump said in a statement.   \nEric Tanenblatt , a former Perdue aide, said Perdue has the qualifications needed to succeed in the Cabinet post. \n“As a successful governor, Perdue has the requisite experience to direct a massive bureaucracy of the sort necessary to conduct the Department’s many programs; as a southern governor and state lawmaker, he’s directly shaped agricultural policy and presided over a state with a $74-billion agricultural sector; and as a businessman with deep experience in agribusiness, he knows the challenges facing today’s farmers,” Tanenblatt said in a statement. \nPerdue’s qualifications were seconded by former Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga. \n“He knows rural Georgia and rural America, and he’ll be a really hands-on guy,” Kingston said. “It won’t be his first rodeo.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T17:59:05.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
