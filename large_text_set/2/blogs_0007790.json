There were 89 kids who died from the illness in the 2015-2016 flu season. \n“The state Department of Health encourages all New Yorkers to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their families from the flu,” the New York State Department of Health said in a statement. “Getting a flu vaccine is the best way for people to protect themselves during the flu season.” \nThere was no information on the ages or specific location of the children who passed away in the city this year. \nThere were five children who died in New York State last season and six each in the previous two flu seasons. \nEveryone 6 months and older is advised to get a yearly flu vaccine, according to the Health Department. \nThe elderly are particularly at risk, with 90 percent of flu-related deaths occurring in people 65 years or older.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:20:03.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
