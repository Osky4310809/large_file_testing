He said that the same man who punched him on camera had assaulted him just minutes before. And after that encounter, Spencer says another man spit on him. \nSpencer said that the punch “didn’t really land” and “didn’t hurt that much.” But he did say that he might have suffered a mild concussion from the strike and that his hearing was slightly off-kilter. \n“I did take a punch. But he didn’t knock me out, he didn’t knock me down,” said Spencer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:53:02.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
