Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images   13.05 GMT Last modified on   13.07 GMT View   Share on Messenger Close \nThe British Red Cross description of the NHS as facing a humanitarian crisis was “irresponsible and overblown”, Theresa May has said during a prime minister’s questions centred on the current problems in the health service. \nPressured repeatedly by Jeremy Corbyn about long waits for emergency care and patients left in corridors, May conceded that were “a small number” of unacceptable incidents, but insisted the problems were mainly caused by increased demand. \nThe Labour leader responded by saying she was being unrealistic. “Our NHS , Mr Speaker, is in crisis, but the prime minister is in denial,” he said. NHS 'will fail' this winter without cash injection, doctors tell Theresa May Read more \nMay, in turn, said Corbyn’s mixed messages on Tuesday about plans for a maximum wage plan showed he would “destroy our economy” and thus endanger funding for the NHS if he took power. \nKicking off the pair’s first exchange of 2017, Corbyn focused exclusively on health and social care, asking May about long waits at A&E departments and the British Red Cross description of the problems faced by the NHS. \n“I have to say to him that I think we have all seen humanitarian crises around the world,” May answered. \n“And to use that description of a National Health Service, which last year saw 2.5 million more people treated in accident and emergency than six years ago, was irresponsible and overblown.” \nCorbyn pressed the prime minister on the issue, saying that the British Medical Association, Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Physicians had all issued warnings about the pressures on health services. “If she won’t listen to the Red Cross, who will she listen to?” he said. \nReverting to his occasional practice of taking questions from members of the public, Corbyn said he had been contacted by an NHS staff member whose ill 22-month-old nephew had been treated on two plastic chairs pushed together, with a blanket on top. \n“I accept there have been a small number of incidents where unacceptable practices have taken place,” May replied. “We don’t want those things to happen. But what matters is how you then deal with them.” \nThe prime minister stressed the record numbers of people seeking emergency care over the Christmas period, and said the government had not dropped its target for all patients to be treated in A&E within four hours. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, had seemingly watered this down earlier in the week. \nCorbyn also pressed May also on social care, saying cuts to service were “trapping people” in hospital and thus increasing the pressures on the NHS. He also questioned her approach on mental health, the subject of a speech she gave on Monday. \nThe extra £1.25bn committed in 2015 to mental health care should have been ringfenced, and not used as “a resource to be raided”, the Labour leader said. \nReferring to May’s other new initiative this week, the idea of the so-called shared society , Corbyn said: “Well, we’ve certainly got that. More people sharing hospital corridors on trolleys, more people sharing waiting areas at A&E departments. More people sharing in anxiety generated by this government. \n“Our NHS, Mr Speaker, is in crisis, but the prime minister is in denial.” \nMay responded by mocking Corbyn for his confused policy announcement on Tuesday, saying: “He may find it difficult to believe that someone will say the same thing they said a few weeks ago.” \nShe added: “The last thing that the NHS needs is a cheque from Labour that bounces. The only way that we can ensure that we’ve got funding for the National Health Service is strong economy. \n“Yesterday, the honourable gentleman proved that he’s not only incompetent but that he would destroy our economy. And that would devastate our National Health Service.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T15:21:42.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
