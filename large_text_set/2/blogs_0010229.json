You don’t believe me? OK, let’s make a bet.” \nNoting the glint in Toure’s eyes, it wasn’t a risk worth taking. Toure is waiting on news of a new deal at City (Photo: Reuters) \nThe man, who may arguably be ­remembered as one of the greatest players in the club’s history, has shed weight and gained an admirer in Guardiola. \nThe City boss has been tasked with reducing the average age of the squad he inherited from Manuel Pellegrini. And teaming up John Stones, Leroy Sane and teenage Brazilian sensation Gabriel Jesus with Raheem Sterling has given Toure the belief that the future is sky blue. \nHe wants a piece of the action – and reckons that the club’s senior citizens still have a big role to play under Pep. \n“The new guys have a big potential,” said Toure. “Sane has been ­unbelievable, Raheem has always been very good, and we are seeing what Jesus can do. But sometimes, when you are young, you start to think that football is easy. Toure says he can mentor City's young guns (Photo: Getty) \n“They have got to keep working hard, pushing all the time to improve, because the moment you think you have arrived can also be the moment when you start to slip. That’s why the experienced players are important. Me, Vincent (Kompany), David (Silva), Zaba (Pablo Zabaleta), we are pushing them all the time to get better. \n“This club is all about winning trophies. When new players come in, they have fantastic skill, but they also have to learn the winning mentality.” \nToure was given a similar grounding at Barcelona. “When we get a free-kick or a penalty, I see the young players look at me and step aside,” he said. \n“I was the same at Barcelona. We would get a free-kick and it was always left to Deco or Ronaldinho or Messi or Xavi. But if a player feels he can make something happen, then I will always step aside. \n“Sometimes Kevin De Bruyne feels it and I say, ‘Go ahead’. Kevin has the confidence to challenge the older players and the young boys we have also have to learn when to step up. I think I can help.” Toure has had his say on De Bruyne (Photo: REUTERS) \nToure also has experience of how a title race can turn in an instant. In 2012, City became champions for the first time in 44 years, despite trailing Manchester United by eight points with six games remaining. \nTwo years later, they waited for Liverpool to slip before, again, taking the title in the final game of the season. \nCity travel to Bournemouth tomorrow, looking to keep their hopes alive after Jesus struck an injury-time winner to defeat Swansea last weekend. \nAnd Toure said: “When we were champions, both times we had to have a perfect end to the season. I think this year can be the same – but we all have to believe it. We can have an influence on Chelsea because, if we keep winning, then they have to keep on winning.
