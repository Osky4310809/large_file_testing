She spoke about the fact that so many of the women who came before her cracked the ceiling, so that by the time she came along, nothing needed to be shattered at all. <img src=\"http://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/regina-king-feat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-782218\" /> The same is true for what Rhimes has been able to do in the entertainment industry. According to <em><a href=\"http://deadline.com/2017/01/regina-king-production-deal-abc-studios-1201882631/\">Deadline</a></em>, veteran, Emmy-award-winning Regina King, who has starred in the Emmy-winning, ABC series “American Crime,” and her production company Royal Ties, signed a two-year deal with the studio behind the John Ridley limited series and ABC Studios. King’s sister Reina will serve as development executive as the two develop and produce new projects. In addition to her deal with ABC, she signed on to star in a Netflix crime drama series called “Seven Seconds.” The development deal shouldn’t really come as a surprise as Regina King has been producing and directing projects for years now, including directing episodes of ABC’s “Scandal” and “The Catch,” OWN’s “Greenleaf” and Fox’s “Pitch.” We can’t wait to see what she creates. <i>Veronica Wells is the culture editor at MadameNoire.com.
