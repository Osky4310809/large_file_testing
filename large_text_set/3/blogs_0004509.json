Mary Jennings Hegar, who served multiple tours in Afghanistan as a helicopter pilot. \nThe Purple Heart recipient saved hundreds of men and women on and off the battlefield in the Middle East and later helped eliminate the military’s ground combat exclusion policy, which kept female officers from serving in combat roles. \n“Shoot Like a Girl” would mark Jolie’s first action project as an actor since “The Tourist” and “Salt” in 2010. She has since toplined Disney’s “Maleficent” and co-starred with her ex, Brad Pitt , in the 2015 drama “By the Sea,” which tanked at the box office. \nShe is repped by UTA and Media Talent Group.
