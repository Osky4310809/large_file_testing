Presiding over a rollercoaster eight years of highs and lows, one of the few constants throughout Obama’s term has been the reassuring presence of the avuncular, need-for-speed-loving , Joe Biden.\nWith the pair set to depart The White House in exactly a week’s time, yesterday the Prez decided to surprise his old pal Joe one last time with the Medal of Freedom award, i.e. — the highest U.S. civilian honor.\nBefitting a bromance as potent as “ Jobama ,” the medal was awarded with distinction, meaning all-round-good-guy Uncle Joe joins an esteemed rank of names including John F. Kennedy, Pope John XXIII and Lyndon Johnson as one of the few to be bestowed such a privilege. Clearly shocked, the VP struggles to hold back the tears as Obama proclaims him his “brother” and “as good a man as God ever created”. Aww.\nBack to Chicago.
