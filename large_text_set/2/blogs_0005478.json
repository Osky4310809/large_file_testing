April-like 60s may linger well into Wednesday afternoon. But at night, temperatures could plunge back into the February-like 30s. Then, when precipitation spreads over the area, there’s a chance of some snowy mischief. But it’s a bit of a long shot. \nLow pressure is predicted to pass close to our area Wednesday night, drawing Atlantic moisture over the region at the same time cold air spills southward in the wake of a front. Rain is likely to break out in the evening hours, and as that chillier air arrives during the pre-dawn hours, some areas may see rain change to wet snow. \nHowever, it’s quite possible that the cold air doesn’t arrive in time and mostly rain falls for the majority of us. \nThe chance of accumulating snow along and east of Interstate 95 is low (10-20 percent), but the odds of some light amounts (20-30 percent) increase as you head toward the north and northwest. Probability of one inch of snow according to the National Weather Service. \nMost precipitation, whatever its form, should end by Thursday morning. \nDespite what some computer modeling is showing, Wes Junker, Capital Weather Gang’s winter weather expert, said he’s “not impressed” by the snow potential. “It’s hard to get excited about snow for overnight when the temperature on Wednesday afternoon is likely to reach the 60s and the temperatures across the area will struggle to get close to freezing by Thursday morning,” he said. “That’s usually not a winning combination for getting accumulating snow.” \nModel discussion \nModels are mixed in their forecasts for Wednesday night. The most likely scenarios presented are either mostly rain or rain changing to wet snow. \nThe European model tracks to the storm to our south — through northern North Carolina to a position just northeast of the Outer Banks. Such a track would allow cold air to gradually become established over the region Wednesday night so that rain changes to wet snow. European model forecasts snow between about 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. Thursday morning in the D.C. area. (WeatherBell.com) \nBut the GFS and NAM model forecast the storm to take a path a little farther north through Virginia which slows the flow of cold air into the region and we end up with mostly rain. GFS model precipitation forecast at 1 a.m. Thursday. \nEven in the snowier European model, it’s a race against time for cold air to arrive while it is precipitating late Wednesday night into early Thursday. No one from the Interstate 95 corridor eastward sees temperatures fall below freezing while snow is falling. At best, this model would suggest a coating to a few inches of slushy snow, more on grassy than paved surfaces, with temperatures 33-35 degrees around the metro. \nIn our colder areas, such as Loudoun, Frederick and northern Montgomery counties, the prospects for some accumulation and even some buildup on the roads are greater if the European model is right. But if the GFS and NAM models are right, even these areas would see mostly cold rain. \nUltimately, everything will have to fall into place perfectly for meaningful snow to occur. We’ll need a strong storm to supply enough moisture and one passing well to our south to draw in enough cold air. \nIn situations in which temperatures are very mild ahead of a storm system like this, Washington tends to have a hard time cooling down enough for snow to really materialize. But every storm is different, so we’ll continue to track this one. \nThe forecast is very sensitive to small changes in the predicted storm track, so it may take until Tuesday or even Wednesday for it to truly come into focus. 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:31:27.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
