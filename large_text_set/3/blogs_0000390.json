That designation tripled his sentence, according to the Jefferson County District Attorney’s Office. \n“It’s the most I’ve ever seen,” said Pam Russell, a longtime spokeswoman with the DA’s office. \nBecause most the charges were crimes of violence, the sentences will run consecutively, Russell said. \nIn November, Mason, 26, Miguel David Sanders, 29, and Tyrone Javonne Richardson, 32, were found guilty on multiple counts including attempted murder, assault, kidnapping, aggravated robbery, burglary, eluding, and aggravated motor vehicle theft. Mason and Richardson were charged with 37 counts, while Sanders was charged with 38 counts. \nIn December, Sanders was sentenced to 371 years in prison. Richardson is set to be sentenced March 8. \nOn Nov. 18, 2015, the armed trio robbed a FirstBank at 1940 S. Kipling Parkway, threatening employees and locking them in the bank’s vault before fleeing with $50,000 in cash.

The man tried to elude them by running down his driveway and was shot in the leg. \nThe victim fell to the ground, got up, and was shot three more times. The bank robbers then stole his mini-van and fled. The man collapsed on a neighbor’s front porch and was rushed to a hospital. He survived. \nSanders was caught by police while hiding under a school bus. Richardson was arrested six days after the robbery. Mason, who was on the FBI’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list, was arrested nearly two months later on Jan. 15, 2016.
