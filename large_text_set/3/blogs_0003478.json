Waiting for round two of Love Actually is a genuine struggle, but it’s actually — finally — happening! Sure, it’s not a full-length sequel, but it’s a 10-minute short for Red Nose Day (appropriately titled Red Nose Day Actually ), and we’ll TAKE IT.\nEspecially since Hugh Grant is returning as the Prime Minister ! Oh YE ! So today is the happiest of Mondays, because producer Emma Freud shared some photos of him and Martine McCutcheon (who played his assistant Natalie/love interest in the film) on set, looking just as perfect as we remember. And SPOILER ALERT… she casually revealed on Twitter that they’re still together in the sequel, and better yet…THEY’RE MARRIED! \nBut first things first, here is Hugh Grant doing what he does best.\nAnd here he is. Our Prime Minister. Again. And still hot. #rednosedayactually pic.twitter.com/yydy1Nc1l0 \n— emma freud (@emmafreud) March 5, 2017 And here’s his other half, caught in a proud moment.\nOur pm is still married. And she's still lovely. #rednosedayactually pic.twitter.com/MGtUVDGiBE \n— emma freud (@emmafreud) March 5, 2017 We’re so excited that director Richard Curtis is bringing these faces back together again, and we CANNOT WAIT to relive all of the charm and tenderness that Love Actually had to offer (not to mention the laughs).\nThe PM, his wife and the writer who never worked out a good camera face. #rednosedayactually pic.twitter.com/TT0pZB5p2P \n— emma freud (@emmafreud) March 5, 2017 There are few movies in life that contain moments that literally make us want to jump up and cheer. via GIPHY via GIPHY And most of the original cast have returned for this short sequel, including Thomas Brodie-Sangster (who is now a totally suave grown up ), Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Liam Neeson and Rowan Atkinson. Sadly, Emma Thompson will not be returning due to the heartbreak of Alan Rickman’s passing last year. That’s completely understandable, and we’ll miss them both.\nHere we go... #rednosedayactually day 4. pic.twitter.com/XKfsW7vr8D \n— emma freud (@emmafreud) March 5, 2017 Since Red Nose Day Actually doesn’t air until May 25th (that’s Red Nose Day in the U.S.), we’ve got a while to wait. But that means plenty of time to binge-watch Love Actually. \nvia GIPHY How convenient!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T18:45:36.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
