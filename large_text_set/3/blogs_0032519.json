The former reality star seemed to take their growing feud to the next level with a cheeky Instagram post Share By JJ Nattrass Emmeline Saunders 14:35, 30 MAR 2017 Get celebs   Thank you for subscribing!   \nThey got into a epic war of words on Sunday night, following a night of drama on the latest series of TOWIE. \nAnd it would seem that Danielle Armstoring has taken her new feud with the show's latest arrival, Yaz Oukhellou, to the next level with a very public dig on Instagram. \nSeemingly taking aim at her ex boyfriend's new girlfriend, the 28-year-old former reality star posed in a provocative slogan tee-shirt, which read, \"She couldn't beat me on her best day\". \nMeow! \nThe pair found themselves clashing after Danielle took BFF Georgia Kousoulou's side in argument between the two current cast-members - something Yaz didn't take too kindly to. \nAnd following a huge argument on Twitter it seems that Danielle has come out swinging, as the caption accompanying the image only seemed to assert the garment's message was directed at her new enemy. \n'Enough said,' she wrote simply, followed by a flaming emoji, a message that wasn't lost on her followers who were quick to come to the conclusion Danielle had just called out Yaz once-more.

Now to wait for the reply.\" \nThe beef between the pair first started on Sunday when Dani, who dated James 'Lockie' Lock while on the show, became embroiled in a serious spat with Lockie's new girlfriend Yaz – and even accused her of only starting an argument to gain more followers.

All love here.\" \nYaz immediately hit back by accusing Dani of making a move on Lockie while he and Yaz were on a date at Essex hot-spot Sheesh. \nDani immediately blocked Yaz, as evidenced by Yaz's screenshot, but that didn't seem to bother the newest TOWIE recruit. \n\"I don't stir I tell the truth I kept my mouth shut about her behaviour but I've had enough now,\" she fired back. \n\"I'm just confronting her as they bang on about saying it straight to their face but when it comes to it I get blocked.\" Yaz revealed Dani had blocked her after she accused her of stroking Lockie's back in a restaurant (Photo: @YazminOukhellou/Twitter) Danielle is now dating Daniel Spiller (Photo: WENN) \nIn response to questions about the back-stroking incident, Yaz revealed: \"She came up to say hi to me then kept waking past and doing it I ignored it and so did he. Yet I'm two faced.\" \nAnd just when the drama was dying down, Lockie fanned the flames by posting a quote on his Instagram and tagging his new girlfriend in it. Instagram \n\"Silence says a lot more than you think,\" the quote said, and fans were quick to pile in with their opinions on the feud. \n\"Bin her off Lockie she's bad news! Fame hungry and gonna cause you so much unnecessary drama,\" said one. Instagram \n\"Your new bird is vile. You need to put her in a place and tell her that's not how a lady should act,\" wrote a second. \nAnd a third summed it all up by saying: \"Getting involved in any drama isn't classy at all but unfortunately it's the job and that's what it's about, as a reality show.\" \nTOWIE returns on Wednesday at 10pm on ITVBe.
