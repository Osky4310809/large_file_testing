The girl was ultimately suspended for three days. \n\"We wouldn't discuss the details of any situation regarding one of our children, they're all minors,\" the school's pastor, David Gehne, told TMJ4. \nHabeck's daughter, Frances, said she was given permission from her teacher to sell the toys, but the principal reportedly saw them and thought they were sexually explicit. \n\nFrances said that she thought the toys would be beneficial to children with Autism.\n\"It just calms you when you touch it,\" she said, Daily Mail reported. \"You squeeze it, it’s cold, and it’s hard to hold sometimes.\"\n\n\"In your wildest imaginations, no adult could possibly view this as a sex toy, this is a water-filled bag,\" Habeck said. The father said he plans on working as hard as he can to clear his daughter's record - even going so far as to start an online blog with witness statements.\n\nIn a similar story, a 5-year-old girl was suspended from school for six months after she hit her teacher with a stick.\n\"My daughter is not a monster and she is the most loving kid you’ll ever meet. But I’m desperate for help because she does have attachment needs and she doesn’t take rejection well,\" Emily Bufton told Metro of her daughter, Lily. \n\"She lashes out and will have a full on meltdown, like she did at school. But she’s only five years old. During the first week she was fine, but the second week the school insisted on keeping her in two hours a day rather than taking her full-time. They started to introduce boundaries and that’s when Lilly kicked off. She likes to be in control and apparently she hurt a teacher with a stick.\"\nLily was ultimately transferred to another school because of her behavior, as confirmed by a spokesperson from the Warwickshire County Council.\n\"They [Emscote Infant School] have confirmed that Lilly has now transferred to another local school and is therefore no longer attending Emscote Primary School,\" the spokesperson said. \"Therefore it would be inappropriate for the school to comment further.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:18:36.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
