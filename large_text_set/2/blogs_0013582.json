It is especially striking how low Mr. Trump’s ratings are given the state of the national economy. In many of those examples, this level of approval presaged a disaster for a president’s party in the midterm elections. FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten pointed ou t that a 40 percent approval rating would put the president’s party on track to lose around 40 seats in the House. The Democrats need 24 seats to retake the House next year. But there are at least a few reasons for Mr. Trump and the Republicans to think things aren’t quite as bleak as Gallup, Pew and the history of presidential approval ratings might suggest. For one, there are reputable polls with more favorable findings for Mr. Trump. A recent Fox News poll of registered voters gave Mr. Trump a 48 percent approval rating. Registered voters are whiter and older than all adults, which explains part of why Mr. Trump fared better in the Fox poll. But it doesn’t explain it all; the Pew Research survey gave Mr. Trump a 42 percent rating among registered voters. Similarly, online surveys have consistently shown Mr. Trump with a higher approval rating than those conducted by telephone. On average, Mr. Trump’s ratings have been 10 points better in online polls. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It’s not the first time that live interview and online surveys have split over Mr. Trump’s popularity. He did better in online surveys throughout the Republican primary, leading many to speculate that there was a hidden Trump vote of poll respondents who were afraid to admit their support to a live interviewer — a phenomenon known as social desirability bias. But the results didn’t quite back up the theory in the end. Mr. Trump won the primaries by the comfortable margin predicted by live interview telephone surveys, not the landslide implied by online polls. And the gap between online and live interview pollsters faded during the general election. Mr. Trump actually fared better in the final live interview polls than the final online polls. The live interview polls also came closer to the mark in the national popular vote. Does that mean the live interview polls are right this time? Not necessarily. In general, taking an average of polls is a safer way to go. By that measure, Mr. Trump’s approval rating is in the low-to-mid 40s. The Republicans can also breathe easier about congressional control because so many are safely ensconced in reliably Republican districts. The Republican grip on the House is so strong that it gives the party a much better chance to ride out a president’s weak approval ratings than in the past. Here’s one way to think about it: Democrats might not take the chamber with a victory on the scale of their huge win in 2006, when they gained 30 seats, or on the scale of the Republican sweep in 2010, which garnered 63 seats. With so many Republican seats safely out of play, a similarly impressive win might still leave the Democrats short of House control. In 2006 and 2010, Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama had approval ratings near or above 40 percent on Election Day. So if you had to make a rough guess, you would probably say that Mr. Trump’s approval rating would probably need to be even lower for House control to become a true tossup. Let’s imagine a rough model of congressional elections since 2002, based on recent presidential election results by congressional district and the president’s approval rating. You would guess that Mr. Trump’s approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average heading into the midterm election would need to be around 35 percent for the Democrats to be an even-money bet for a House takeover. You should note that the pre-election approval polls are often polls of likely voters, an even whiter and older group of voters than registered voters, so Mr. Trump’s rating among all adults would probably need to be a bit lower. But really, what’s striking is that we’re even having this conversation at all at this time. In general, a president’s approval rating is at its peak in the first month. Mr. Trump could easily slip further. If his ratings average falls into the mid-to-low 30s, the Republicans could be in serious trouble. \nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.
