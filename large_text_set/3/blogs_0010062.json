Merely days after it discounted both Sprint and T-Mobile branded versions of both handsets by $250 and offered a free 128GB microSD card with them, Samsung has now slashed $200 off the AT&T Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. It’s also going to ship a free 128GB microSD card with every purchase. \nYou can now head over to Samsung’s online store and purchase the Galaxy S7 for $394.99 instead of $594.99 and the Galaxy S7 edge for $494.99 instead of $694.99. That’s an instant saving of $200 and all customers will also get a free 128GB microSD card. This is a limited time promotion so act fast if this appeals to you. \nSamsung has been offering a flat $100 discount on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge since last week as well so you can take advantage of that promotion as well if you’d rather have the Verizon variant or a factory unlocked unit. The $100 discount has been applied across the board. However, in this particular promotion, it will throw in a free 64GB microSD card with the Galaxy S7 and a 128GB card with the Galaxy S7 edge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T04:19:40.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
