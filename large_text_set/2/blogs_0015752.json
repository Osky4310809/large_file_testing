He says that was a mistake. And he says he never intended to suggest sexual abuse of minors is OK. \nOn Monday he was disinvited from the Conservative Political Action Conference after video of his remarks was promoted through social media by a conservative blog. \nPublisher Simon & Schuster announced it would cancel the publication of his upcoming book, “Dangerous.” \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
