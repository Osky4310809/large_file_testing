Most Popular I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac I was pushin' through the crowd to get to where she's at And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat There are not five better lyrics in all of American music better than that verse. Hell, I'm not entirely sure if I can come up with five better verses in all of English poetry if you spotted me Mr. Yeats and the entire Oxford Anthology. The comic desperation of the protagonist is impeccably limned. The meter's perfect, the imagery sublime. Have you ever seen a coffee-colored Cadillac Me, neither, but I have heard Southern diplomats campaign-shoutin'. I surely know what that's about so, yeah, I trust the poet on the Cadillac, too.   Getty Michael Ochs Archives Chuck Berry invented the language of rock and roll and, through that, reinvented the English language for several generations. He did it in that most American way possible, the way Mark Twain did it, or Walt Whitman, or Kerouac. He did it by experimenting, by playing with the language as though it were the greatest toy he'd ever found. Consider the other things he did with it. Most Popular As I was motorvatin' up over the hill/I saw Maybellene in a Coupe de Ville. (Maybellene) You'd motorvated in your time, too. You just didn't know the word for it. Pay phone, somethin' wrong, dime gone, will mail/ I ought to sue the operator for tellin' me a tale Ah, too much monkey business, too much monkey business/ Too much monkey business for me to be involved in. (Too Much Monkey Business) Close observation of the human condition. (You had similar botheration last week, didn't you?) And, from it, Bob Dylan was inspired to write \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\" They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale/ The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale. (C'est La Vie). Coolerator. It's where you get the cold drink after a hard day of motorvatin' and campaign shoutin', I guess. Getty David Redfern And, finally, the restatement of the American Dream for a new century, just the way Walt Whitman yawped it in the streets of Manhattan.   His mother told him, \"Someday you will be a man,/ And you will be the leader of a big old band. Many people coming from miles around/ To hear you play your music when the sun go down. Maybe someday your name will be in lights/ Saying 'Johnny B. Goode tonight'.\" That \"maybe\" is the poet's touch. It's depthless in its possibilities. It might happen. It might not happen. But it has a chance to happen, and that's all that ever has mattered in America. That chance. Of course, the possibility gets a little brighter when you hang it on that riff. The Riff. The only Riff. The riff that reached across the Atlantic and into Keith Richards and John Lennon and also reached all the way down through the years, like the faint echoes of The Big Bang, unto the generations. (And, let us be honest, in his personal life, Chuck Berry really was a remarkable sort of pervert. Art would be a noble pursuit if it weren't for, you know, artists.) So much of the American reinvention of the language happened in its newspapers, too. They became different kinds of things, especially in the 20 th Century, when the children and grandchildren of the various European immigrants came of age, got educated, and began flooding into print. The newly arrived often learned English from the newspaper; this is a central plot point in Deadline USA, one of the great newspaper movies of all time. Sooner or later, along came what became known as The New Journalism, which wasn't really new at all, because it essentially revived the traditions of American journalism that had been squashed by the deadening hand of \"objectivity\" and respectability. This is generally considered to have occurred in longform in the nation's magazines but The New Journalism really began with a new generation of newspaper columnists, people like Mike Royko and Pete Hamill. And Jimmy Breslin. Getty Michael Brennan From the start, he was the biggest of them. He filled the room the way few others did. He saw more than other columnists did. He heard things in a different way. When people talk about \"voice\" in journalism, they're talking about more than the way you put sentences together, or a gift for metaphor. They're talking about all of those, but they're talking about a unique way of seeing and hearing the world, a close eye for the strange and wonderful on the fringes, a close ear for what is said between the lines. That's how Breslin got his most famous column, the one about the man who dug John Kennedy's grave at Arlington , a piece of work so famous that they taught it to us in journalism school, which was not an institution for which, truth be told, Breslin himself had any respect. \nHe saw more than other columnists did. He heard things in a different way. But there was more to him than the larger than life presence. There even was more to him than the newspaper columns and the magazine pieces. Jimmy Breslin was a genuinely great writer. World Without End, Amen is a terrific novel. I'd Like To Thank My Brain For Remembering Me , his book about his recovery from a brain aneurysm, is closely reported as well as being moving and, in parts, completely hilarious. And his Watergate book, How The Good Guys Finally Won, an account of the downfall of Richard Nixon as seen from the office of then-Speaker Tip O'Neill, is one of the most underrated studies of those events, and certainly the most entertaining, but with gleaming edge to it when it was needed. Consider, for example, Breslin's description of the hiring of John Doar, a hero of the Kennedy Justice Department when civil rights workers were being killed in the South, as lead counsel for the House Judiciary Committee's investigation of Nixon's crimes. Breslin was sharp enough to see what Doar's hiring would mean. You can hear the bell tolling away in the background. \nAnd so John Doar came to Washington. Melvin Laird assured people in the White House that Doar was a fine choice. \"He will not find anything if there is nothing to find,\" Laird said. \"We couldn't ask for anything more.\" Which was a proper determination, providing that Richard Nixon was more or less innocent, as Laird at the time believed. The one who knew differently, Nixon, said nothing. He should have. For John Doar believes in everything Richard Nixon does not. And John Doar is a fearsome opponent. We lost both of them over the weekend, Chuck Berry at 90 and Jimmy Breslin at 88. That they were contemporaries in America is a measure of how lucky we have been as a nation. We have been luckier than most in the people who come along to explain us to ourselves, and to do it in a language that is always new with promise, always fresh with possibility, always motorvatin' over the next, distant hill. It really does go to show that you never can tell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:14:45.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
