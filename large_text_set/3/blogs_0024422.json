(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) It's clear that the Republican-proposed American Health Care Act won't go to a vote Friday — and perhaps, in its current form, never will.\nAnd Democrats are thrilled.\nThey had argued for weeks that the GOP legislation would make insurance plan prices skyrocket, and take insurance away from millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. Republicans have a majority in the House, but enough of them opposed the bill that it stood no chance of passing. That's why President Trump asked House leaders to pull the bill just before the vote was scheduled at 3:30 p.m. Friday.\nA video taken by Rep.
