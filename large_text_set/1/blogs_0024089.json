He is anxious to get to spring training next month. \n“That second kid is a game-changer. We’re going on four or five hours of sleep most nights, but two hours at a time tops so that aspect of it has been fun but challenging,” Braun said Sunday at the “Brewers On Deck” winter fan event. “But other than that it’s been the healthiest offseason I’ve had in a long time — knock on wood.” \nBraun is by far the most recognizable player left on a club in the midst of a rebuilding project. At age 33, he heads into spring training as the elder statesman, coming off a productive season in which he hit .305 with 30 homers and 91 RBI. \nTwo offseasons ago, Braun had a procedure to fix a nerve issue near his right thumb. A year later, he had back surgery. \nThis time, about the biggest baseball-related issue for Braun has been the speculation about whether the Brewers might finally trade him. Braun is in the second year of a five-year extension that will pay him $20 million this season. \n“I’ve dealt with (trade rumors) for a little while now so it’s really not a big deal to me,” Braun said. “Obviously, I love Milwaukee, my family loves Milwaukee. If we didn’t, we would already be out of here. So it’s pretty easy for me to stay focused on the things I can control.” \nThe rebuild around him seems to be moving along on schedule. \nMilwaukee won 73 games last year, a five-game improvement from 2015. The first potential piece of the team’s future core arrived in the majors in August in shortstop prospect Orlando Arcia.
