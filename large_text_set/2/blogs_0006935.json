New Yorkers were advised to avoid driving and use caution when commuting to and from work. \n\"Folks please, don't be fooled by the warm weather,\" OEM Commissioner Joseph Esposito said during a Thursday press conference. \n\"A winter storm warning is in effect from midnight tonight to 6 p.m. tomorrow night, so the storm is coming. We can expect between 6 and 12 inches.\" \nThe heaviest snow is expected to fall between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m., with up to three inches of wet flakes falling per hour, Esposito added. \n\"That will create whiteout conditions,\" the commissioner said. \"The visibility will be very, very poor.\" \nThe Department of Sanitation will have 2,300 piece of equipment including plows and spreaders at the ready and expects to use between 30,000 and 50,000 tons of salt. \nDOS salt spreaders and plows were to start clearing roads early Thursday morning. (DNAinfo/Ben Fractenberg) \nThe department will also be using smaller plows to get more-difficult to access streets in Staten Island and Queens, officials said. \nThe salting will begin as soon as the first flakes start falling the plows will roll out once there is at least 2 inches of snow on the ground, Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia said during the press conference. \nOfficials urged New Yorkers to stay off the roads and use public transportation to commute. \n\"This will be a very dangerous storm,\" Garcia said. \"During the period of time that it's coming down it will be extraordinarily difficult to drive.\" \nAlternate side parking will be suspended Thursday, so New Yorkers won't have to worry about moving their vehicles. \nThe MTA could also see service changes with some express lines running local and reduction in bus service, depending on snow accumulation, according to the agency . \nA Code Blue was also issued for the city's homeless, officials said. No one will be turned away from city shelters and the usual intake procedures will be loosened. \nThose seeking updated information on the storm and services can check Notify NYC and NYC Severe Weather .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:19:04.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
