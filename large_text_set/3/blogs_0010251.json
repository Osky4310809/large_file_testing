While the hit show is still on air, networks are trying hard to keep the momentum going. The Big Bang Theory prequel Young Sheldon is in the works, and we just got word as to who’ll be playing young Sheldon himself. (For the record, he’ll be about nine — so, they’re not kidding when they use the word “young.”)\nFirst, it’s important to know that this show is pretty much a guarantee. CBS ordered episodes, and it’ll be featured in the 2017-2018 lineup .\nAnd while Jim Parsons won’t be acting as Sheldon in the series (since, he’s a talented man — but we don’t think he can pass for nine) he’ll be narrating the episode, ala Bob Saget in How I Met Your Mother .\nKnowing he’s still part of the series helps ensure us that it’ll be really good. \nSo, the big question — have we seen the Young Sheldon actor prior to, or is this show the start of a long resume?\nThe role will be played by Iain Armitage, who you might recognize from the new HBO show Big Little Lies . Playing Ziggy Chapman on the show, he’s been hard at work on a few other projects this year as well. For example, he’s got two movies waiting to be released — Our Souls at Night , and I’m Not Here . So, he’s really taking the entertainment world by storm .\nOh — and he has an adorable YouTube channel. It’s safe to say that “young Sheldon” is going places.\nAside from Armitage, the cast also includes Raegan Revord, Lance Barber, Zoe Perry, and Montana Jordan. Perry, by the way, is the daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who plays Mary Cooper on The Big Bang Theory . She’ll be taking over her mom’s role for the prequel, which is genius casting.\nWe can’t wait to see the first episode. We must admit — it sounds incredibly promising.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T15:47:02.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
