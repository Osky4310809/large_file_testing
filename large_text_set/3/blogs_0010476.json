And even when it's done, the snow will probably stick around as temperatures will stay below freezing until later in the week, forecasters said. \nHere's what to expect, hour by hour, according to forecasters: \nTUESDAY \n► Midnight — Snow is set to begin falling after midnight. \n► Overnight temperatures will bottom out at 31 degrees and stay there through the morning. \n► 6 a.m. —\"The period of intense snow will probably start around 6 a.m.,\" said NWS' Melissa Dispigna. \n► Snow will fall about 2 to 4 inches per hour with winds gusting up to 50 mph all of which make \"whiteout conditions likely,\" forecasters said. \n► 10:20 a.m. (high tide) — Expect 2 to 3 feet of flooding in coastal areas about the time of high tide. \n► Late morning to early afternoon — Snow might be interrupted by some precipitation occasionally during this period, before becoming all snow again. \n► Sundown — The storm should be all but done by sundown at 7 p.m. though some flurries may continue through the night. Those aren't expected to accumulate though. \n► Winds will continue through the night as temperatures drop to 20 degrees. \nWEDNESDAY \n► Temperatures will rise up to about 32 degrees though the winds will continue to blow up to 20 mph and the occasional snow shower could pepper the city in the afternoon. \nTHURSDAY AND FRIDAY \n► Temperatures will finally begin to rise and the sun should come out, which will allow the snow to melt. Temperatures Thursday will rise up to 34 degrees in the day and then 38 come Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T17:55:24.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
