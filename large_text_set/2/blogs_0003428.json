It is estimated to have cost between €30,000 and €40,000, reports France24. \nMélenchon isn’t the first politician to use the futuristic tactic to spread their message to the masses. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used a huge hologram of himself to gain attention in 2014 when he was prime minister. \nHolograms have also been favored by fans nostalgic to bring back deceased entertainers Tupac and Michael Jackson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:19:20.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
