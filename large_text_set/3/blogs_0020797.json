Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' \n“Hygiene products are an essential part of many of our everyday lives but disposing of them has always been an issue,” said chief executive Justin Tydeman. “For the first time, we can all enjoy the benefits that the products bring and know that they are disposed of in an environmentally responsible way.” \nPHS removes waste for 90,000 customers across the UK and Ireland including offices, schools and care homes. \nOrdinarily hygiene waste products are either sent to landfill or burned. Burning wet waste before it has been dried is expensive because it has to be heated first. PHS group wants to dry absorbent sanitary products and burn them as recycling (PHS) \nBut under PHS’s patented LifeCycle programme, the commercial hygiene waste is collected from the likes of cinemas, shopping centres and leisure centres and sent to a specialised facility in the West Midlands. \nAny moisture is squeezed out of this waste before the burning process. \nPHS believes hygiene products take up to 500 years to decompose and is one of the largest contributors to UK landfill. Sweden is amazing at recycling \nAn estimated three billion nappies are thrown away each year in the UK - according to the Environment Agency - and, the average woman is believed to buy more than 11,000 tampons in her lifetime. \nThe PHS idea is mimicked elsewhere in Europe, including in Sweden, which has run out of rubbish because of its recycling successes.
