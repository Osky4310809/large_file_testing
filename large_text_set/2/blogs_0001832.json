Elbert County will be home to 210 turbines and 41 miles of the transition line, Xcel spokesman Mark Stutz said. \nThe project, which is the first that will be owned and operated by the utility, was announced in April 2016 . Xcel only has a few more steps to go. \nAn appeal period to Elbert County’s decision closes Feb. 23. The utility ordered 53 turbines from Vestas in June and will now order the remainder, Stutz said. In a couple months, the utility will transfer assets with lead developer Invenergy, which has a regional office in Littleton and has been responsible for securing private land leases, getting approvals from the counties and building the wind farm. \nInitial construction will focus on roads and staging areas for the turbines. The farm is set to be up and running by the end of 2018. The wind farm will create six to eight permanent jobs with Xcel and roughly 20 to 30 full-time maintenance jobs in the area, Stutz said.
