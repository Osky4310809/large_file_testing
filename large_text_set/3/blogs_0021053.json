The squads include a mix of top performers from the recently-concluded Vijay Hazare Trophy like Govinda Poddar, Krunal Pandya, Prasidh Krishna, Shardul Thakur, Pankaj Rao, etc. That apart, even some of the fringe India players who have become a regular feature in the A side like Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Mayank Agarwal, Dhawal Kulkarni, etc. have also been included apart from India's limited-overs regulars, who aren't in the Test side, like Rohit, Shikhar Dhawan, Axar Patel, etc. \nMahendra Singh Dhoni, who led Jharkhand to the semifinals of Vijay Hazare Trophy and put up some fine performances with the bat was a surprise omission from the two squads named by the selectors. In seven innings, he scored 330 at an average of 66 and a strike rate of 98.8 \nWhile Manoj Tiwary has been included in the side at the back up some good show with the willow, selectors have also included out of favour players like Harbhajan Singh, Ashok Dinda and Ambati Rayudu. \nThe tournament is set to serve as a good ground for national and fringe players like Rohit, Manish Pandey, Dhawan, Axar, Jadhav and Gurkeerat Singh with India not expected to play any competitive 50-over competition before the ICC Champions Trophy. \nSquads: \nIndia 'Blue': Rohit Sharma (c), Mandeep Singh, Shreyas Iyer, Ambati Rayudu, Manoj Tiwary, Rishabh Pant (wk), Deepak Hooda, Harbhajan Singh, Krunal Pandya, Shahbaz Nadeem, Siddarth Kaul, Shardul Thakur, Prasidh Krishna, Pankaj Rao \nIndia 'Red': Parthiv Patel (c & wk), Shikhar Dhawan, Manish Pandey, Mayank Agarwal, Kedar Jadhav, Ishank Jaggi, Gurkeerat Mann, Axar Patel, Akshay Karnewar, Ashok Dinda, Kulwant Khejroliya, Dhawal Kulkarni, Govinda Poddar © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:33:22.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
