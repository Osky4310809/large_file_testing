Plus, there are plenty of other cool upcoming Android phones worth looking forward to. But bruises aside, Samsung is still the king of the Android smartphone. Its next flagship phone, the Samsung Galaxy S8, should remind everyone of that. Here’s everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S8.\nDate and Price Although we probably won’t be hearing about the Galaxy S8 until late March, after the Mobile World Congress show next month, you should still expect it to go on sale in mid-April, which isn’t too far off from the normal release cycle. Carriers will first get locked versions and then unlocked versions. As for prices, rumors are suggesting as low as $650 for the base model and as high as $850 to accommodate for more expensive components.\nFeatures What you really want to know is what can the Galaxy S8 do besides call people, download apps, and run Android 7.0 Nougat? A bunch of things… if the rumors are true. We’ve compiled reports from VentureBeat , SamMobile , The Guardian , and savvy Twitter users to paint a clearer picture of the S8.\nThis is the Samsung Galaxy S8, launching March 29 https://t.co/lQZ0K0q2MA pic.twitter.com/dlusRMX4YH \n— Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 26, 2017 \n\nLet’s start with some specs. The S8 will come in 5.7/8- and 6.2-inch models and the AMOLED screens will have a narrower aspect ratio. The non-removable batteries will be 3000mAh and 3500mAh. There will either be 4GB or 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and MicroSD card support. In the US the processor will be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. Everywhere else it will be Samsung Exynos 8895.\nNumbers are cool but what can a layperson expect from this thing? The front camera will be 8-megapixel, the rear will be 12-megapixel, and both will be pretty similar to previous models. There could be both a fingerprint scanner and an iris scanner for added security. The phone continues the trend of water resistance being a standard feature. There might be no Home button, but there will be a USB-C port and a headphone jack. Thank Grodd.\nPrevious flagship Samsung phones came in standard versions and premium “Edge” versions with curved displays. However, the only version of the S8 will be the curved version with a nearly bezel-free, edge-to-edge screen. We may have even seen it already.\nW tym lepiej widać zagięcie. Lekkie zaokrąglenie jest też na gorze i u dolu #GalaxyS8 pic.twitter.com/KXKfn6t9GO \n— DforDesign (@dfordesign) January 18, 2017 \n\nThose are some nice features, but what can the S8 do that’s really exciting? It will be compatible with new Gear VR and Gear 360 accessories for consuming and creating even more accessible virtual reality content. Taking a cue from some Windows phones, you can use the S8 as a desktop computer powered by Android.\nFinally, the S8 will have a new Samsung voice assistant currently known as “Bixby.” Along with being the best actor to play the Incredible Hulk, Bixby may be based on Viv Labs artificial intelligence. The company, a recent Samsung acquisition, employs former Siri creators. Bixby’s core feature, Bixby Vision, allows to it to access apps, process payments, and make visual searches. How long until someone makes an Avengers of phone assistants?\nWe’ll find out what’s true about the Samsung Galaxy S8 and what isn’t soon enough.
