He even participated in a PSA asking Electoral College members to dump Trump.\nDespite all that, he was still asked to DJ at an inaugural ball by a booking agent. His response: \"Hahahahaha.\" In an Instagram post, Moby went on to say he would do it, but on one condition.\nSEE ALSO: Need to take the edge off on Inauguration Day? Light a free joint in D.C.\n\"I guess I'd DJ at an inaugural ball if as payment #trump released his tax returns,\" he wrote Tuesday .\n\"Also I would probably play public enemy and stockhausen remixes to entertain the republicans. I'm still laughing. Hahahaha. So #trump what do you think, I DJ for you and you release your tax returns?\"\nA photo posted by moby Xâ“‹X (@moby) on Jan 9, 2017 at 8:52am PST\nWe daresay the president-elect won't take up Moby's offer, but he has prepared a playlist of songs, at Billboard's request, that he thinks would suit the occasion.\nIt includes appropriate tunes like Public Enemy's \"Fight The Power,\" The Clash's \"I'm So Bored With The U.S.A.\" and Green Day's \"American Idiot.\" You can listen to them all on Spotify.\nAnd so the search for big artists to play Trump's inauguration goes on, with Elton John swiftly shutting down claims he would play.\nAs for who's in, The Rockettes look to still perform despite reported protests within the group . Also confirmed is the Mormon Tabernacle Choir ( despite a member recently quitting ), and 16-year-old former America's Got Talent contestant, and 'Apocalypse' singer, Jackie Evancho .\nBONUS: As predicted, Donald Trump wakes up and rants about Meryl Streep on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/moby-donald-trump-is-actual-sociopath-w448443", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/1uUBuPxp.jpg", "https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:billboard.com:playlist:0oe2e7vRBAGeIhuLAISWIN", "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7572616/moby-open-letter-to-america-trump", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/1uUBuPxp.m3u8", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPDQ8nWjBMp/", "https://play.spotify.com/user/billboard.com/playlist/0oe2e7vRBAGeIhuLAISWIN"], "published": "2017-01-11T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:58:33.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
