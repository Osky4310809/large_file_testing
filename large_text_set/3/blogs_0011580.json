(Photo: jeremymcconnellcooke/Instagram) \n\"I never thought that we would be able to forgive each other for what has gone on in the past, but having Caben around has changed everything. \n\"We have both done a lot of growing up, we're not the same people we were and are trying our best to co-parent as much as we can in order to be good parents to our son.\" \nJeremy recently moved from Ireland to Liverpool to be closer to Caben – but Steph admitted that although they're back on speaking terms, they're not officially back together just yet. \n\"No we're not back together,\" she admitted. (Photo: jeremymcconnellcooke/Instagram) \n\"We're just taking it day by day – I don't know what the future holds. Our priority at the present time is to provide what's best for Caben. \n\"We'll always hold a special place in each other's hearts as Caben's parents, but for now we both have work commitments coming up that we need to concentrate on.\" \nBut Steph revealed that the family had a very emotional reunion when Jeremy met his son for the first time. \n\"He spent ages just looking at Caben and then he got very emotional and started welling up,\" she said. \n\"I gave him a hug, but he was hiding his face from me so I wouldn't see him crying.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T13:07:53.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
