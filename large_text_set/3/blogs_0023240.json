His strike won the friendly 1-0 for Germany, but more importantly, its dramatic, emotionally stirring qualities shattered the last remaining bits of sporting relevance the occasion might have otherwise exuded. \nNobody, Germany coach Joachim Low included, said much about the poor showing from the home side, and almost nobody asked questions about it afterwards either. Podolski's picture-perfect farewell provided a great cover for disappointing performance. \nLow conceded that Gareth Southgate's tidy, organised side had played \"with more intensity,\" whereas his own team had struggled to combine effectively in an unfamiliar line-up. Why the introduction of one debutant -- Timo Werner of RB Leipzig -- alongside young prospects like Leroy Sane (Man City) and Julian Brandt (Bayer Leverkusen) should have such a negative effect wasn't entirely clear, however. \nEngland, by contrast, seemed entirely untroubled by the new, not well-rehearsed system and less experienced players in the starting XI. Only some wayward finishing and a fine performance from Marc-Andre ter Stegen in the Germay goal stopped the away team being 2-0 or 3-0 up at half-time. \nLow made no effort to hide his frustration with the first 45 minutes which were a catalogue of defensive errors, technical mistakes and half-baked attacking moves. With the possible exception of Toni Kroos, whose class on the ball is pretty much unassailable, no German player was able to reach anywhere near their usual level. \nJonas Hector, in particular, was all over the place in the early stages: out of position, out of ideas and out of his depth. Low cried out in anger a couple of times as the 1.FC Koln left-back kept missing clearances and giving the ball away. Yes, it was only a friendly, but Hector's horror show will have nevertheless have given Low food for thought. \nThe gulf between the 26-year-old, the only player without experience of European club football in Low's line-up, and his peers seems to have widened since Euro 2016. Or to put it differently, Hector has not significantly progressed during regular outings for Koln, a team that defends reasonably well and boasts an outstanding goal-scorer in Anthony Modeste but offers little by way of creative football under coach Peter Stoger. Germany coach Joachim Low was pleased to see Lukas Podolski bow out of international football with a stunning winner. \nLow would do well to actively scout alternatives to Hector over the course of the next 15 months because Germany's left-back weakness, a long-established problem going back to Philipp Lahm's switch to the right side of defence in 2010, was never more pronounced than on Wednesday night's evidence. \nTo make matters worse, Joshua Kimmich looked extremely rusty on the opposite flank. The Bayern Munich defender has seen limited action under Carlo Ancelotti this season and it showed. Luckily for Low, he's set to become Lahm's dedicated successor at the Allianz Arena next season once the 33-year-old retires. \nAnother concern that's set to linger after the game was Germany's dearth of central strikers. Werner has been outstanding for Leipzig in the league but tried too hard to make an impact against England, rushing his passes and making bad decisions. More game time with the national team should calm his nerves but whether the converted winger, who thrives in Leipzig's high-tempo transition game, will ever be the right fit for a Germany team usually tasked to break down overwhelmingly deep opponents is another question altogether. \nThe 21-year-old needs to change his game and concentrate on shorter, better-timed runs in the final third if he is to emerge as a real contender for Russia 2018 but the injured Mario Gomez may not feel his position is under much threat. \nCertainly Low has proved himself an expert in compensating for these shortcomings and there's no reason to feel despondent just yet. But the 57-year-old must also know that the scoreline vs. England bore little relation to the overall game and it was only Podolski's thunderbolt that saved him from more public criticism and introspection. \nAs Germany said goodbye to one legend and looked to the future, one thing was clear: the work of moulding a supremely talented squad into a functioning team capable of defending the World Cup next year is far from over. \nRaphael Honigstein is ESPN FC's German football expert and a regular guest on ESPN FC TV.
