Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA \"bus of hate\" emblazoned with a transphobic slogan is set to tour schools in Madrid this week. \nUltra-conservative, Catholic organisation Haste Oir launched the crusade in response to a trans awareness campaign in Spain. \nHaste Oir's bus reads: \"Boys have penises, girls have vulvas. Don’t let them fool you. If you’re born a man, you’re a man. \n\"If you’re a woman, you will continue to be a woman.\" \nIt comes in direct reaction to a campaign from trans support group Chrysallis, which launched the slogan: \"There are girls with penises and boys with vulvas.\" \nHaste Oir, which translates to \"make yourself heard,\" launched a petition to have the adverts pulled. President of HazteOir.org Ignacio Arsuaga has received death threats since the campaign was launched (Photo: @ iarsuaga / Twitter) \nBut when that failed they responded with their transphobic vehicle - which has been branded the \"bus of hate,\" according to Spanish website La Vanguardia . \nActuall, Haste Oir’s media site, reported the bus will travel to a number of Spanish cities as \"a counter campaign to respond to the message by the Chrysallis association.\" Read More Transgender dancer spends £45,000 on perfecting 'feminine' look with boob jobs and face reconstruction \nThey say it is also to raise awareness of a pamphlet they produced last November. \nThe brochure features a cover of two children raising their arms in a Nazi salute to a rainbow flag, reports Gay Star News . \nThe group claims sexual diversity laws in Spain rewards \"the conversion of individuals to homosexuality.\" \nThey also claim LGBTI people want straight people to become \"second-class citizens.\" \nAfter receiving death threats online the president of HazteOir.org said at a press conference today that the bus is \"not intended to offend anyone.\" \nIgnacio Arsuaga said: \"The objective of the campaign is to denounce the impositions of the gender ideology that violates freedom of education and the fundamental right of parents to educate their children. \" Read More Amazing athletic baby holds the plank yoga position for an impressive 34 seconds as mum cheers him on \nHe also claimed the group’s bus merely displays “a biological fact that is studied in schools.” \nMadrid’s City Council has promised to take the “ appropriate measures” necessary to stop the bus from touring the city saying the vehicle does not comply with local council publicity and traffic ordinances. \nChrysallis released a statement on their website condeming Hazte Oir today.
