But she had reportedly suffered severe burns. \nWhen Vanguard visited the widower, Chief Ibor Okpa, he said his wife was trying to illuminate her room with a lantern, which ended up claiming her life. \nHis words: “It was the loud explosion and her cry for help that attracted me and other neighbours that tried to rescue her. But all efforts to rescue her proved abortive as the raging fire on my wife’s body and her room was really fierce.” \nAccording to him, they took her to a drug store for first aid, before she was taken to a clinic, where she died. \nA resident of the area, Mr. Philip Elemi, disclosed that the explosion was caused by adulterated kerosene, which is in circulation in the area. He added that there has been more than 12 kerosene explosion since January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:23:41.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
