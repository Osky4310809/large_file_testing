(Photo: Jed Leicester / BPI)   \nIf ever you needed proof that fate/sod's law (take your pick) exists in football, this should just about do it. \nSutton United are back to the harsh reality of the Conference Premier today after their FA Cup glamour tie against Arsenal on Monday night. \nThe game comes after a turbulent week in the spotlight for Sutton. In case you've been living under a rock for the last few days, their reserve goalkeeper and club caretaker Wayne Shaw was forced to hand his resignation in after the betting storm surrounding his pie-eating antics on the sideline. \nThat left Sutton United without a substitute goalkeeper for the game this weekend while they look to recruit a replacement. Surely they'd be fine for one game? (Photo: REUTERS) \nWrong. \nJust 15 minutes into their away game at Torquay United, goalkeeper Ross Worner was forced off injured - leaving Sutton keeperless. \nCue defender Simon Downer strapping up the gloves and taking over between the sticks. And it wasn't long before he was involved... \nWhat a wonderful image that is - a defender playing in goal, leathering a clearance against an onrushing striker which flies back over for a goal kick. \nIt doesn't sound more beautifully Sunday League, does it? We wonder what the odds on Wayne getting a call on Monday morning are? poll loading Has Wayne Shaw been harshly treated over his pie-eating? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:19:10.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
