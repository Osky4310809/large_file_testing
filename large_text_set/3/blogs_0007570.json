Tom Hardy went unnoticed with his new beard (Photo: Twitter) \n“Then, as he was leaving, one of my colleagues spotted him and that’s when he got all the attention. \n“Staff and customers were getting pictures, they couldn’t believe it. \n“I served him at the bar and he was very down to earth and chatty. We had a joke because he kept yawning and then he went to sit down. \n“I then served him his sausage and mash and his friend a bacon and cheese burger. They were very complementary about everything.” The actor grew his beard out for his role on Taboo (Photo: BBC) \nHardy has starred in the biographical western thriller The Revenant, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. \nHe also portrayed Bane in the superhero film The Dark Knight Rises, “Mad” Max Rockatansky in the post-apocalyptic film Mad Max: Fury Road, and both of the Kray twins in the crime thriller Legend. \nHe stars in Dunkirk, an epic war thriller set to be released in July 2017, and was recently seen in BBC One’s major new period drama Taboo. He looks completely different with facial hair (Photo: Splash News) \nBut the reason for his visit to Minley remains a mystery. \n“I believe he is in the area due to filming, but I’m not too sure what for,” said Ashleigh. \n“I also believe the reason why he wasn’t very recognisable is because of his beard, which he has seemed to have grown, maybe for the part he is filming for.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T13:32:58.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
