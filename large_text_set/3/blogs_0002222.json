Stockton in particular favored the old-school short-shorts look.\nNow, almost 20 years later, there's a kid named Stockton Malone Shorts tearing up Utah's high school hoops scene. Just the other night, he scored 17 points to help his Copper Hills squad advance in the state tournament . ESPN lists him as a 6-foot-3 guard who's the state's ninth-best recruit .\nMore importantly, though, now that the internet has taken notice: Dude, what is up with that epic name??\nThis is Stockton Malone Shorts. He's the best player in the highest level of Utah high school ball this year.

You see, when two people love each other very, very much ... no, wait, let's start over.\nBack in 1996, according to a Salt Lake Tribune story from two years ago, Rylan and Kelly attended an exhibition game against China as part of the U.S. Olympic Team's pre-Games warmup tour. Among the members of that '96 squad were — you guessed it — Stockton and Malone. Jerry Sloan, legendary head coach of the Utah Jazz, served as one of the Olympic team assistants.\nBefore that game, according to the Tribune , Rylan and Kelly were walking along sporting Team USA jerseys when a van stopped nearby. Stockton, Malone and Sloan then exited the vehicle to briefly shoot the breeze with the Shorts and sign some autographs.\nThe encounter, Kelly Shorts told the paper, \"left us kind of speechless.\" Rylan was already a huge Jazz fan, but Kelly says she was \"sold\" on the squad after the cordial, unexpected meet-up with the team's biggest stars.\nMore than two years later, the couple's first son was born and given his very unique name.\nAs you can see from the photo embedded in this article, our high school hooper favors shorts much longer than the Daisy Dukes once worn by the NBA point guard who inspired his first name.\nBut Stockton (Malone Shorts) does wear (John) Stockton's number 12.\nThat's some classic (John) Stockton (Malone Shorts).\nBONUS: Learn how to play the guitar in 60 seconds thanks to this musical system", "external_links": ["https://www.ksl.com/index.php?sid=43329914&nid=504&title=copper-hills-moves-past-lehi-in-5a-tourney-thanks-to-stockton-shorts", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/OkOstQLw.jpg", "http://insider.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/206190/stockton-shorts", "https://twitter.com/andyblarsen/status/836405554398404608", "http://www.sltrib.com/sports/2158743-155/kragthorpe-stockton-shorts-comes-to-life", "https://t.co/RXRqcKGchO", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/OkOstQLw.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-01T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:13:44.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
