Bush and his family often traveled to their ranch in Crawford, Texas, Obama’s travel costs were neverheless higher. \nWhile presidents typically pay for personal trips out of their own pockets, The Washington Post reported, taxpayer dollars cover the costs of the staff and security as well as the use of Air Force One. \nThe Obamas’ took a total of 29 vacations over their eight years in the White House spanning 228 days — which, as Zero Hedge noted, at an aggregate cost of $90 million, equates to roughly $400,000 per day or $3.1 million per trip. \nFurthermore, it would be bad enough if it were just vacations that taxpayers had spent this much money on, but we paid for political trips, too.
