If you wanted to get below $0.50 per GB, Samsung's OEM-only PM951 was the only option, and there are plenty of concerns with going that route. Intel is the first company to come out with a viable budget NVMe drive at retail, in the form of their 600p series. Available in capacities of 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB, the best value is in the 512GB and 1TB sizes, where price per GB is around $0.33. That's almost too tempting to pass by, but you give up some performance compared to the fastest NVMe solutions. \nI recommend skipping the 128GB and 256GB options—if you go with one of those, performance will be similar to a good SATA drive, and you're still paying more. Where the 600p becomes interesting is at the 512GB mark, and the 1TB option means you have enough capacity for a large collection of games, applications, and other files. The reality of storage is that many users don't do enough to really warrant spending a ton of money on the fastest SSD possible, but for a moderate price premium the 600p does very well. I plotted overall performance against capacity and cost, and the 600p ranks near the top of the stack. Cost is a consideration for most PC builders, and Intel strikes a nice balance between performance, capacity, and price. \nIntel uses a third-party controller in the 600p, a Silicon Motion SM2260 with custom firmware, and pairs that with their own IMC 32-layer 3D NAND. The 3D NAND operates in TLC mode, which typically has a higher impact on heavy write operations. Intel helps offset this by configuring a portion of the NAND as an SLC cache, though continuous writes will fill up the SLC cache and performance suffers. For read-centric work, the 600p does well, but in longer tests (like our IOmeter results where the drives are subjected to an hour of mixed read/write work) it can fall just below the level of the best SATA SSDs. \nIf that sounds like a critical flaw, I have to note that in most of our tests it doesn't actually matter that much. A real-world file copy of a game directory with 8800 files totaling 18.4GB showed performance that was nearly twice as fast as any of our SATA drives. Booting Windows, launching applications, and other everyday tasks also did well, and PCMark 8's Storage test gave us a bandwidth figure of nearly 350 MB/s—again besting all of the SATA drives we've tested. If you work with tons of small files or want to run an IO heavy database or server on the 600p, that's not the best idea, but for a gaming PC with a large SSD as the primary drive, Intel's 600p is a great alternative to the Samsung 850 Evo we've been recommending for the past two years. Best Add-In Card NVMe SSD Fast and high capacity Works in any x4 PCIe slot and no throttling Needs a PCIe slot Uses more power than other SSDs \nM.2 is great for laptops and newer systems, but what if you’re using an older desktop? Assuming you have a spare PCIe slot (at least a physical x4 connector), Intel’s SSD 750 SSDs were the first consumer NVMe drives to hit the market, and in some respects they’re still the fastest drives around. You could put these in any desktop in theory, though again you'll need a motherboard with NVMe support if you want to use the SSD 750 as a boot drive. \nBuilt from the same DNA as the company’s enterprise DC P3700, the SSD 750 is a consumer-focused drive with firmware optimizations that favor improved random I/O rather than maximum peak transfer rates. The main area where the SSD 750 excels is in sustained read/write scenarios, where the heatsink allows it to beat out the competition. In our mixed read/write random testing, the SSD 750 is nearly 20 percent faster than the 960 Pro, but that's one of the only victories. \nPeak performance is rated at 2,500/1,200 MB/s read/write, and 460K/290K IOPS. The lower-capacity 400GB SSD 750 doesn’t perform quite as well as the 1.2TB model, and there’s also an 800GB model , but if you’re serious about NVMe storage we would stick with the 1.2TB drive. Intel also offers the SSD 750 in a 2.5-inch form factor , using a U.2 (previously SFF-8639) connector—and there are M.2 to U.2 adapters as well, which is what I used for testing the 400GB drive, but I'd suggest either getting the AIC version or go for a 960 Pro rather than looking at U.2. \nIntel's 600p (see above) is a great budget offering using the new 20nm 3D NAND , but performance is nowhere near that of the SSD 750. We're also still waiting to see Intel's Optane SSDs with 3D XPoint Technology, which promises even better performance than 3D NAND. However, Optane completely missed the original 2016 launch date and may not even come out in 2017, which is unfortunate as phase-change memory could prove the next big thing. Read More Testing and other NVMe drives \nThe number of NVMe drives is still somewhat small, which means all of the consumer models are worth a look simply by virtue of existing. Not all NVMe drives are created equal, however, and our three primary choices represent the best overall pick, a high performance option add-in card for desktops, and a budget option that aims for the sweet spot between performance and price. \nAfter waiting for most of 2016, we finally have a bunch of new contenders in the NVMe realm. Many of these still fail to match the performance of the Intel SSD 750 and Samsung 950 Pro, the first consumer NVMe drives we tested, but pricing has come down a lot since last year. More drives are in the works, and we'll have to see if any of those can displace Samsung and Intel in the future. \nThe NAND chips make up a substantial portion of the total SSD price, and fundamentally there usually isn’t much of a difference between a SATA drive with 512GB V-NAND and an M.2 NVMe drive with the same 512GB V-NAND. NVMe requires a new controller and firmware, and there are associated R&D costs, but long-term NVMe prices should get a lot closer to SATA SSD prices, with a moderate premium. Economies of scale are still a factor, however, so until more systems use NVMe SSDs, prices will stay higher. The competition \nBesides the drives we've recommended, we've also looked at several other NVMe drives. Many of these are very close to replacing some of our primary choices, particularly in the budget sector where a minor price change could make all the difference. Here's the complete list of NVMe SSDs that we've tested, in alphabetical order, along with a brief summary of results, with notes on the form factor: AIC (add-in card), M.2, or U.2. \nIntel 600p (M.2): Our budget pick is actually the slowest NVMe drive we've tested, but it also costs substantially less than any of the other drives. We've even seen the 512GB model on sale for as little as $130, putting it squarely in the realm of budget SATA offerings. Maximum performance is rated at 1,775/560 MB/s and 128.5K/128K IOPS, again the slowest of any NVMe drive. The 600p works best in lighter workloads, with strong sequential throughput but only moderate random IO, and the TLC 3D NAND can slow things down in write-heavy workloads. \nIntel SSD 750 (AIC or U.2): The first consumer NVMe drive to hit the retail market, Intel's SSD 750 series is still a contender. Performance is excellent and in some areas it's the fastest drive—it's rated at 2,500/1,200 MB/s and 460K/290K IOPS. The main problem is that it's only available in two formats, as a PCIe x4 AIC, or as a 2.5-inch U.2 drive. Neither is suitable for laptop use, and U.2 support on motherboards is seriously lacking. There are M.2 to U.2 adapters, which are a bit awkward as routing the U.2 cable can be a bit difficult depending on what you have around the M.2 slot, but if you have a U.2 port or want a PCIe AIC drive, Intel's SSD 750 has excellent sustained IO performance. It also uses up to 20W, compared to 5W for most M.2 drives, which definitely helps keep performance high. \nPatriot Hellfire (M.2): Powered by the Phison 5007 controller, there was a time when anything using a Phison controller would cause a sad shake of the head. Not so these days, as the Patriot Hellfire proves to be a capable NVMe drive. Its performance rates well above the Intel 600p at least, and if you need an alternative budget option, this is the one to get. Available in capacities of 240GB, 480GB, and 960GB, the Hellfire's biggest weakness is sustained random writes, where it's only marginally better than many SATA drives, but for normal workloads it does very well. It's rated at up to 3,000/2,200 MB/s and 116K/210K IOPS—the lower read IOPS score clearly being the biggest concern. \nPlextor M8Pe (M.2 or AIC): Another potentially great option for a less expensive NVMe drive, depending on sales. The M8Pe uses a Marvell 88SS1093 controller and MLC NAND to deliver very respectable performance. It's basically equal to the Toshiba OCZ RD400 and is available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB capacities. You can also get it with an add-in card adapter, at a higher price. Rated at up to 2,500/1,400 MB/s with 280K/240K IOPS, the M8Pe can be a great value. \nSamsung 950 Pro (M.2): Samsung's first retail NVMe drive, the 950 Pro is still a contender, though the 960 Pro is obviously intended to replace it. Combining 3D V-NAND with their in-house UBX controller, the 950 Pro has fast transfer speeds, great performance consistency, and it's supported by Samsung's Magician software. It's rated at 2,500/1,500 MB/s and 300K/110K IOPS for the 512GB model, with the random write speeds being the main deficiency. Slight throttling under heavy sustained loads is a minor concern, and one we've seen with other M.2 drives, but a small fan in the vicinity of the M.2 slot takes care of things. \nSamsung 960 Pro (M.2): The current king of SSDs, the 960 Pro boasts speeds of up to 3,500/2,100 MB/s and 440K/360K IOPS (with a slightly lower 330K/330K IOPS on the 512GB model). Combined with the new Polaris controller, excellent performance, and support in the way of Samsung's Magician software and a custom NVMe driver, the 960 Pro is our top recommendation for an NVMe drive. It's also relatively expensive, and high demand has caused the drive to go out of stock at many resellers. \nSamsung 960 Evo (M.2): Slated to launch on December 13, the 960 Evo is the slightly slower TLC V-NAND alternative to the 960 Pro. This is the first retail TLC NVMe drive from Samsung, and pricing is quite a bit lower than the 950/960 Pro, with capacities of 250GB/500GB/1TB. Performance is also somewhat lower, with the drive rated at up to 3,200/1,900 MB/s and 380K/360K IOPS, though raw specs don't tell the whole story. Sustained random IO is about 30 percent lower than the 960 Pro, but the drive does hit the sequential read/write targets. This is one to watch in the coming weeks. \nSamsung PM951 (M.2): Is there such thing as an affordable NVMe drive? Samsung's PM951 used to be the least expensive option prior to Intel's 600p, often by a rather large margin. Unfortunately, it's an OEM-only drive, so while you can find it online you won't receive any official support. Also, the drives use TLC NAND, and particularly on the lower capacity models performance ends up being no better than the faster SATA drives. It's rated at 1,050/560 MB/s and 250K/144K IOPS for the 512GB model, which is the slowest sequential read speed of any NVMe drive. \nSamsung PM961 (M.2): The precursor to the retail 960 Evo, the PM961 is also a TLC V-NAND drive, with the 512GB model rated at 2,800/1,600 MB/s and 260K/260K IOPS. It uses the same Polaris controller as the 960 Evo, but apparently firmware and other aspects aren't quite as tuned. Still a reasonable budget option, though the lack of direct Samsung support is a concern. \nSamsung SM951 NVMe (M.2): Samsung's first M.2 NVMe drive is still around, but it's mostly for OEMs meaning there's no direct Samsung support. Performance is actually pretty similar to the newer 950 Pro, and better in a few cases, but unless you get one of these with a laptop there's no particular reason to pick one up. \nSamsung SM961 (M.2): Like the PM961, this is the OEM version of the 960 Pro, with similar performance ratings but no official Samsung support. It's rated at up to 3,200/1,800 MB/s and 450K/400K IOPS, so if you're anxious to get a 960 Pro and can't find one in stock, this might be worth a look. I'd stick with the official retail drives, however. \nToshiba OCZ RD400 (M.2 or AIC): Toshiba was the first to get a 1TB M.2 SSD to market, and initial demand was very high. Prices on the 1TB drive remain high, pitting them directly against the Samsung 950 Pro / 960 Pro. The RD400 models aren't quite as fast as Samsung's equivalents, with the 1TB drive rated at 2,600/1,550 MB/s and 210K/130K IOPS, but despite the relatively tame specs the drive does better than most of the non-Samsung competition in actual performance. \nToshiba XG3 (M.2): All indications are that the XG3 is the same hardware as the RD400, only it's a drive sold solely to OEMs. That means no direct warranty support and it's difficult to find for purchase. We did find one 512GB drive at Newegg, at a relatively low price, though other drives are a safer bet. \nZotac Sonix 480GB (AIC): A newly launched NVMe drive, Zotac uses Phison's new E7 controller. Phison used to be the whipping boy of SSD controllers, but since their S10 line came out in 2015, they've improved dramatically. The Zotac Sonix boasts high sustained transfer rates of 2,800/1,500 MB/s; unfortunately, random IO doesn't fare as well, despite the 300K/200K IOPS rating. Combined with the limited options (the NVMe Sonix is only available as a 480GB AIC) and high price make it difficult to recommend at present. \nThe above chart only includes drives and capacities we've been able to test, and we've included the non-NVMe Predator along with the Samsung 850 Pro to highlight what NVMe brings to the table. The 850 Pro is the fastest SATA drive around, but it loses out to even the slowest of the NVMe drives we've tested in general use. \nThe overall ranking loosely correlates to transfer speed in MB/s across our test suite, which consists of AS SSD, CrystalDiskMark, IOmeter, PCMark 8, and real-world file copying. Some of the tests focus on purely random IO, which can be useful when determining the weaknesses of a particular drive, but desktop users rarely if ever do anything that follows a completely random pattern. \nSome online stores give us a small cut if you buy something through one of our links.
