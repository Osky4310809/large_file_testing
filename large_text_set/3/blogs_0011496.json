(Photo: Cara Howe/Netflix) 65 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJessica Henwick doesn’t have to talk much about sacrificing her body for Netflix’s new series Marvel's Iron Fist . Her Instagram account is worth a thousand words. \n“It’s pretty vicious, right?” the British actress says, laughing about the many bruises she's posted on social media from playing Colleen Wing, the martial-arts master who runs a New York City dojo and helps Danny Rand (Finn Jones) take on bad guys. \nBut her comic-book throwdowns in Iron Fist (streaming Friday on Netflix) and the upcoming The Defenders is just one aspect of a geek-friendly couple of years: Henwick flew an X-Wing as pilot Jess Pava in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and cracks a mean whip as Nymeria Sand on HBO’s Game of Thrones . \nThe 24-year-old Asian actress checks in with USA TODAY about Colleen, Iron Fist and whitewashing concerns that have plagued her new show. \nColleen Wing (left, Jessica Henwick) meets Danny Rand (Finn Jones) on the streets of New York in 'Marvel's Iron Fist.' (Photo: Patrick Harbron/Netflix) \nWhat do you like about Danny and Colleen’s relationship? \nI found it quite a gender swap. Colleen has this dark sense of humor, she can be a little bit bullish, and she’s struggling living hand-to-mouth — all characteristics we’re more used to seeing from male lead characters. Danny’s wide-eyed and naïve and innocent — he’s kind of an ingénue. \nWhat’s the coolest martial-arts move you can do now? \nA spinning hook kick. I have very bad mobility with my hips, and when we started, it would just make me cramp and I couldn’t reach the height. Now, I can’t do it amazingly well, but I can pass. \nIron Fist has always been white in the comics, but many fans were miffed that Marvel didn’t cast an Asian actor. Do you see both sides of the argument? \nI know what it is like to be misrepresented and underrepresented; however I’m also in the show, have seen Finn’s work and I’m Finn’s friend. It was a discussion I had to have with myself where I know the community I come from was thinking one thing and it was like, ‘Do I want to be a part of a show that’s already getting criticism?’ It is more about Danny’s journey in New York and him finding his identity than it is about Asian culture. But Colleen is a fascinating representation of an Asian-American and so unusual, and that was really what sold me. \nJessica Henwick starred as X-Wing pilot Jess Pava in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens.' (Photo: Lucasfilm) \nSo can we expect you back in Star Wars: The Last Jedi ? \nI’m contracted for three (movies), but no, I’m not in the latest one. ( Force Awakens ) is to date my favorite work experience. We had this thing where (director J.J. Abrams) would stop filming in the middle of a take, blast music over the speaker and everyone would have to dance. And everyone did! \nGame of Thrones returns in July . Anything you want to reveal? \nIt’s quite explosive — that’s the word I would use for this season. The Sand Snakes meet some characters they’ve never seen before and the stakes of this season are as big as any previous season we’ve had. \nJessica Henwick returns as Nymeria Sand, one of the Sand Snakes, for a new season of 'Game of Thrones.' (Photo: Helen Sloan, HBO) \nWhat pop-culture franchise is next on your wish list? \nI know my brothers would really want me in Star Trek , but I grew up with the Harry Potter books so if the opportunity came, I would kill to be a part of it. 65 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T20:22:40.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
