That is why I am going to reach out to someone like Peter Mandelson, who I’ve had my disagreements with over the years, and invite him for a cup of tea. \nLabour needs to stop bickering amongst ourselves and unite. \nLet us drink tea, not make war. We need to take the fight to the Tories over what they are doing to our country because there is much Labour supporters agree on. \nFor example, the Budget this year falls on International Women’s Day. \nAnd although it is great we have a female Prime Minister, Theresa May has supported every tax and benefit change in the last seven years, which has meant 86 per cent of the cuts have fallen on women.

Chancellor Philip Hammond (Photo: PA) \nOnly Labour will end zero-hour contracts, cap boardroom pay and make the super-rich publish their tax returns. \nOur NHS is in a state of emergency because the Tories have slashed its funding. Social care too is in crisis due to local council budget cuts, meaning more than a million vulnerable elderly people are not getting the care they need. \nOnly Labour can be trusted to provide the funding our NHS needs. \nA united Labour party is what the Tories fear most. This week you will see us come together to show they have no answers for working people.
