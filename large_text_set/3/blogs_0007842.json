Following this, the winners of each category will be announced at the New York International Auto Show in April. \nThe six categories are as follows: World Car of the Year, World Luxury Car, World Performance Car, World Green Car, World Car Design of the Year and World Urban Car. That last one is a new category addition to the awards. \nSelecting the top three finalists in each category was done by secret ballot, where a 75-person jury will evaluate each candidate before casting their vote. The jury is made up of 75 international automotive journalists from 23 countries. \nIn 2016, the Mazda MX-5 was awarded World Car of the Year, besting the B9 Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz GLC. The roadster also secured another award that year – the World Car Design of the Year – which also included the Jaguar XE and the CX-3. \nOther winners in 2016 include the Audi R8 Coupe for the World Performance Car award, the G11 BMW 7 Series for the World Luxury Car award, and Toyota Mirai for the World Green Car award. \nSo, what models made it through? Here’s the full list of finalists in the World Car Awards: \n2017 World Car of the Year", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T05:40:08.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
