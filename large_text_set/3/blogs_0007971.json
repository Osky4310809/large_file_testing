Even as IRS commissioner John Koskinen insisted that his agency had cooperated completely in the scandal over the targeting of conservative groups, even as its defenders claimed that all the evidence had been seen, the IRS keeps finding more and more documents related to the scandal . Go figure .\nAt least they’re consistent on cooperation, though:\nThe IRS has told a federal court that they’ve recently identified almost 7,000 more documents that could contain information on how the agency targeted the tax-exempt applications of Tea Party organizations or other conservative political groups starting back in 2010, according to a court document.\nBut IRS in the document would not commit to a timeline for releasing the documents.\nThe revelation of thousands of unreleased documents was made in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit from Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group that specializes in filing, and in many instances litigating, FOIA requests.\nEr … timeline? Given that several years have gone by, and that both courts and Congress have demanded this information repeatedly, why is the IRS even discussing timelines ? If they have identified these documents, they should produce them immediately.\nThis could inspire a new move by House Republicans to impeach Koskinen, who managed to avoid that process once. A better question might be why he’s still there at all. Donald Trump took office almost two months ago, and while Koskinen has a set term of office, it’s still a political appointment that serves at the pleasure of a president. Jay Sekulow argues that Trump should boot Koskinen out immediately:\nPresident Trump continues to work, as he puts it, to “drain the swamp.” And there’s no better place to focus those efforts than beginning the process of restoring the credibility of the IRS by demanding the resignation of Koskinen.\nI have repeatedly maintained that we still have an IRS that is corrupt and incapable of self-correction.\nIt was clear President Obama had no intention of removing him. But with President Trump now in the White House, Koskinen must go. The American people deserve nothing less.\nWhy he’s still there at all is a mystery. Koskinen should have been asked to leave at 12:01 pm on January 20th. Firing Koskinen wouldn’t just be a good decision for political purposes to build up some goodwill with House conservatives who have been demanding his head for years, it would be a major demonstration of swamp-draining, as Sekulow rightly argues. Koskinen should have been on Trump’s Day 1 agenda.\nThis new disclosure gives the White House a new opportunity. If they want to highlight abuses of power in the previous administration, they don’t need to claim wiretapping of Trump Tower to do it. They should instead highlight this case of the use of the IRS to punish political opponents of the Obama White House and pledge a new effort to expose everyone involved in it. That makes it less about Trump personally and more about the activists and voters who supported him.\nIt’s a gift from the IRS, which comes along very rarely. Will the White House recognize it?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T17:20:44.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
