Like backpacking, diving or as it was in my case, a day at the spa. As ridiculous as it may sound but in a lifetime of 27 years, the blessed idea of parking myself in the luxuries of a dimly-lit room never, once, crossed my mind. Call it negligence but for practically all of my adulthood, I had deprived myself of the bliss more commonly known as the body massage. \nWell, that was until, on a recent trip, at the Taj Vivanta in Bekal, I was handed over a complimentary voucher for a session at a spa. Being a spa virgin, I willingly took on the offer and a day later, found myself waiting patiently for my turn at the reception. As directed, I filled out the cautionary form, picked out the areas of my body that I wanted the maximum attention paid to (lower back, hips and shoulders) and dished out unnecessary medical history ( “I get panic attacks before my period”). To say that I was oh-so-prepared wouldn’t be an understatement. \nAnd then she called me in. \nMy masseuse introduced herself as Yang. Her tone, although welcoming, wasn’t overtly sweet or cajoling. She spoke in a particularly low voice, in tune with the soothing silence around her. She directed me to the changing room with a set of instructions that I could hardly make sense of. Thereafter, she left me to my business. Seconds later, I was staring at disposable underwear and a rich-girl robe. I had legitimate questions about the tools in front of me. “Am I to take off my bra?”“Why isn’t there a disposable bra?”“Do I need to tie my hair in a bun?”“Wouldn’t it be awkward if I roam around in a bathrobe?” See, nobody talks about these first-time anxieties, especially when you are about to lie semi-naked in front of a stranger. Disappointed that there was no Q&A guide in sight, I slipped on the disposable underwear and threw the robe on. \nYang welcomed me to the assigned room that relied on 20-odd candles for light. Sleep-inducing music played in the background. At her signal, I awkwardly took off the robe, placed myself on the bench, face-down and took a deep-breath to fully submit myself to the tense moment. \nYang began. She took over my calves, at first, periodically asking me about the appropriateness of the pressure. She reached for my thighs, next. At this point, I wished all of my cellulite to disappear, if only for a half hour. My always-hurting back was next. The times when I felt the pressure was a tad too overpowering, I chose to keep shut as an ode to the quiet of the room. “I will survive”, I said to myself as Yang moved her hands across the curve of my back. She touched the scar on my upper back. For a second, I felt we had a connection. I was tempted to narrate the incident (for the 1000th time in my lifetime) that gave birth to that scar but a fear of oversharing silenced me as Yang moved on. \nWhat if I had met my masseuse in a club, at a bookshop or in any other random setup that wasn’t a spa? We’d be having a conversation, right? We’d talk at length about our shared interests, our solo girl travels, maybe even invite each other to a girls’ night-out. \nMy thought trail was broken by Yang asking me to turn over. I did as she asked and returned to my fleeting thoughts. Maybe Yang was disappointed in me. I probably didn’t fit her idea of a perfect massage subject. I focused on being the ideal participant for the rest of my session. Yang catered to my arms, my face and my abdomen, finishing off each part with an award-winning manoeuvre. At last, she stroked my hair and said, “Ma’am, you can change.” \nI was heartbroken. She didn’t have to address me as ma’am; especially now that she had seen me naked. Of all the people who had seen me go commando, Yang was probably the kindest. She was oblivious to this proximity. I sure, wasn’t. Before returning to the changing room, where I would be, again, faced with a barrage of questions (Do I take this disposable underwear with me?), I asked Yang for a selfie. She replied with a polite but stern “no”. Since a no means no, I withdrew myself. \nLooks like I broke my spa-virginity with a one-sided love. While Yang broke the many knots I had in my body, she unknowingly also broke my heart. But hey, we’ll always have Bekal, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:28:48.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
