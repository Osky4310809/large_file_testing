Liberals are outraged… again! \nOne of their favorite targets is Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway. What did she do this time? She put her feet up on the couch in the Oval Office. Fire her immediately, right? \nTo many, Conway looked way too casual while President Trump was meeting with leaders of historically black colleges and universities who were all standing around the Resolute Desk. In the photo above, it appears that she was trying to get a good picture angle on her phone. \nWall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens recoiled after seeing the photo and stated , “If [Condeleeza] Rice or [Valerie] Jarrett had sat like this in Oval Office, conservatives would have screamed themselves hoarse for weeks. Now we own trashy.” \nOf course, people used Twitter to jump all over her, including CNN’s Marc Lamont Hill who made it all about — you guessed it — race: It is hard to believe that Kellyanne Conway would been sitting like this if the President were meeting with the NRA or White evangelicals… pic.twitter.com/bsG3bYwLi4 \n— Marc Lamont Hill (@marclamonthill) February 28, 2017 \nLoud-mouthed liberal Keith Olbermann used his potty mouth to mansplain how Conway should’ve been sitting: Get your fucking feet off the furniture, @KellyannePolls . This isn't your home. https://t.co/12DpukKDkS \n— Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) February 28, 2017 \nNormally, feminists hate when men are bossy, but as long as it’s a conservative female that’s the target, Conway is fair game. \nAnd boy, do liberals have short-term memories! How quickly they’ve forgotten about President Bill Clinton and gal-pal Monica Lewinsky showing each other some “class” in, around, and on top of everything in the Oval Office. If they can’t remember back that far, they sure won’t remember that Presidents Gerald Ford used the desk, gifted by Queen Victoria in 1890 to President Rutherford B. Hayes, for a foot prop, just like George W. Bush did. \nAnd what about the media’s favorite president ever, Barack Obama? Were they this incensed when he broke Bush’s protocol and reversed the jacket required mandate while in the Oval Office? Or how about when — GASP — President Obama rested his feet on the Resolute Desk while conducting business? Did they fly into a Twitter outrage? Hardly. \nSee, the liberal elite play by different rules and the media is too distracted by this kind of stuff to do actual journalism. Welcome to 2017, where everything is upside down. \nClick CONTINUE to see what didn’t bother them just a few short years ago: Order my Book, There Goes My Social Life: From Clueless to Conservative !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T07:39:51.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
