Our culture often times puts unrealistic pressure on moms to ‚Äúbounce back‚Äù and get back to their pre-baby body weight ASAP. That‚Äôs why Australian fitness model and mother Tammy Hembrow posted an untouched photo of what her stomach looks like after pregnancy.\nIt‚Äôs been six months since she gave birth to her second child, and in the photo she‚Äôs holding her baby and wearing a t-shirt and leggings. She‚Äôs lifted up her shirt so you can see the loose skin on her belly where her baby‚Äôs foot it, and she‚Äôs anything but embarrassed about it.\nProud of my mama bod & my loose skin ü§ò - Wearing @gymshark #gymshark #6monthspostpartum \nA post shared by Tammy ü¶Ñ (@tammyhembrow) on Feb 17, 2017 at 7:20pm PST \n‚ÄúProud of my mama bod and my loose skin,‚Äù she writes. As Tammy proves, having a little bit of loose skin on your body after giving birth to a healthy baby is totally normal and it‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of. Instead of trying to hide her stomach or edit it out of the picture, she‚Äôs letting all 5.5 million of her Instagram followers see her true self.\nBeing a mum is the best thing I've ever experienced. The sleepless nights, the poo explosions, the endless spit ups, the tantrums, the first words, the giggles, the unconditional love, the snuggles. I love EVERYTHING about being a mama to my two little loves and I thank God every single day for giving me the best gifts I could have ever imagined. It's a 24/7 job and it's a job I LOVE \nA post shared by Tammy ü¶Ñ (@tammyhembrow) on Feb 22, 2017 at 1:18pm PST \nThis is important because we get so caught up in the idea of changing and altering our bodies after pregnancy , as if it‚Äôs the most important thing to do as a mother. Tammy has always been outspoken about her post-baby journey , though, hoping that many other moms out there will follow suit and share their story, because there‚Äôs nothing to hide.\nTwinning with my baby love those little teeth kill me \nA post shared by Tammy ü¶Ñ (@tammyhembrow) on Feb 19, 2017 at 1:03pm PST \nShe‚Äôs gotten a lot of positive feedback from her photos. Other mothers comment about the loose skin on their own bodies, thanking Tammy for her honesty. She may encounter some critics, but Tammy isn‚Äôt going to let that slow her down.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:11:47.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
