The Hawaiian star is still getting life out of his third studio album’s lead and title single, “24K Magic,” and the album’s second single, “That’s What I Like,” is on its way to selling gold. For the week ending March 9, Kyle’s Lil Yachty-assisted “iSpy” made some moves, and Remy Ma’s “SHETHER” made a Top 20 debut while her rival Nicki Minaj took a significant drop on Gucci Mane’s “Make Love.” \nFuture’s “Mask Off” jumped into the #6 spot from #18 on the previous chart, and adding an interesting wrinkle to the sales numbers this week, XXXTENTACION’s “Look At Me” hit #34 despite originally being released in 2015. Bruno Mars At #1 and #2 \nMars’“That’s What I like” has appeared the top of the digital R&B/Hip-Hop sales charts for the past three weeks, with “24K Magic” comfortably at #2. Inching closer to selling gold with 412,405 copies scanned, the top-seller has a while to go in catching up with its platinum-selling predecessor. Kyle Gets “iSpy” To #3 \nKyle doesn’t have a lot of material out there with only two studio albums to his name. However, the catchy “iSpy” has been a slow cooker for the West Coast rapper and Lil Yachty’s feature verse adds flair to Ayo and Lege Kale’s production. The song also recently got an animated video . Remy Ma’s “SHETHER” Debuts In The Top 20 \nAlthough Remy Ma’s Nicki Minaj diss “SHETHER” was categorically banned from distribution , it still garnered enough interest from fans to debut at #20 on the charts. Minaj’s Gucci Mane-assisted “Make Love” fell from #14 to #72 just a week after its debut. Check out more stats from the Remy/Nicki feud here .
