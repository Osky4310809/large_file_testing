Victims of a shooting the Louisiana rapper was involved in are said to be the impetus behind the potentially garnished monies. \nIn 2001, the artist born Corey Miller reportedly opened fire at a Baton Rouge nightclub and bar although his handgun wasn’t fully operational. Those who were struck in the shooting filed civil judgments against the 45-year-old C-Murder after news broke that the rapper has possibly been recording and releasing new music from behind bars, reports local publication The Advocate . \nAlthough jailed since 2009 and serving a life sentence for the 2002 murder of teenage fan Steven Thomas, a look at C-Murder’s discography reveals that he’s released a handful of projects since his incarceration, including a joint album with Boosie Badazz titled Penitentiary Chances released in the spring of 2016. \nThe Advocate adds in its reporting that the victims — which include the bouncer he allegedly tried to gun down, the bar’s owner, a bartender, a bar manager and a patron — are hoping a state judge will award them access to C-Murder’s earnings. C-Murder’s continuing music career launched an investigation into how he was able to record new music in prison, although it hasn’t been determined if the music was pre-recorded. \nC-Murder enjoyed success in the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of his brother Master P’s No Limit Records family. Alongside P and their brother Silkk The Shocker, they formed the trio TRU. Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
