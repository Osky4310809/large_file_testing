So, what makes for an exquisite kiss between two lovers? \nIs it the actual technique? \nIs it the energy exchange? \nIs it fast and passionate, or slow and lingering or somewhere in-between? \nI’ve often pondered these questions, because let’s face it, some kisses are way more enjoyable than others. Yes, it does take two to kiss, but sometimes is just doesn’t really flow as well as it should and there’s always room for improvement. Here are six extra sensual kissing techniques for your kissing pleasure in 2017. \n#1 Make your lover yearn for your lips. \nBegin by allowing your lips to linger in front of your lover’s lips. Breathe. Feel your lover’s gentle breath linger over your lips and into and around your mouth. Take time to feel into the subtle energy between you—enjoy the stillness and silence. Do not rush. Build up the yearning. Resist the temptation to bring your lips together and pull away when you feel your partner wanting you. Make them beg silently for the taste and sound of your kiss. And then, when you are ready, brush your lips up against theirs, but only slightly, giving them a taste of what’s to come. \n#2 Go super slow. \nNow that you’ve mastered the art of the linger, you can progress into slow kissing. Remember, kissing is quite possibly one of the most sensual and exquisite sexual acts that exists, therefore, I encourage you not to rush. Instead slow your kissing down to an excruciatingly slow pace, eventually building it up to a deeper and more intense experience. \nDo not introduce the tongue straight away, begin with small slow kisses (remembering to breathe, don’t hold your breath). Explore your lover’s lips. Taste them in every cell of your body. Go slowly, so slowly that you feel your partner wanting more, but knowing you have all the time in the world to build up the intensity. \n#3 Breathe. \nUsing your breath during kissing allows the sexual energy to flow up through your body and chakras , eventually syncing with each other to create a beautiful flow of sexual energy that connects you at a deeper level. There’s no special breathing. Simply don’t hold your breath and when you feel it’s getting unbearably hot (and you’re so turned on you can’t stand it anymore), imagine that you are breathing the sexual energy up from your sex centre (the area at your cock or pussy) and into your heart and consciousness. This is a simple practice that allows for the energy to flow through your entire body, connecting you with your lover at all three center (not just your sex center). \n#4 Alternate between slow and sensual, and hard and rough. \nNow that you’ve mastered the art of slow kissing and things are getting hot and heavy, it’s time to alternate between slow kissing and firmer kissing. Introduce a harder, sexier, more predatory kiss. Perhaps you gently scratch your lover’s back while your tongue enters their mouth with more force. Perhaps your breathing is deeper, and your sounds are louder (yes, sound is welcome during kissing). Perhaps you gently bite your lover’s lip, or you bite their neck, bringing out your wild woman/warrior who has a deep yearning to f*ck your partner. Alternate between this style of kissing, the yearning and lingering and the slow kissing. \n#5 Eye contact, eye contact, eye contact. \nThere is nothing sexier than a lover who looks you in the eyes and can hold your gaze. Not everyone is comfortable with this, so if the thought of it makes you cringe, I suggest you begin to get comfortable with it, because eye contact is crucial for mind-blowing sensual kissing and sex. So, if you feel like the kissing is getting increasingly hot and heavy, and you want to slow down, slowly pull away, open your eyes and wait for your lover to do the same. Now hold their gaze, and be truly present with each other. Simple eye gazing can bring about orgasm without any touching or kissing—it’s such a powerful and beautiful way of connecting and a true form of intimacy. Also, try kissing with your eyes open, this is one of the most erotic and sensual ways to connect. \n#6 Use sound. \nDon’t be afraid to make sounds when you are kissing. Sound activates our body so when we allow ourselves to let go and breathe, the sound of kissing is beautiful, erotic and even more powerful. You may also find that slow, intimate kissing can bring about orgasm—and orgasm is even more powerful when sound is used as a form of expression. So let loose with the sound. ~", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T21:06:33.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
