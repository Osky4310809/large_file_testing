Because of this expansion, tens of thousands of firearms that were legally transferred in Massachusetts for the last 20 years are now prohibited. \n“Banning firearms because of the way they look or operate is unconstitutional and undermines the fundamental, individual right to self-protection,” said Chris W. Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action.” \nThe National Rifle Association supports this lawsuit. On behalf of our five million members, we applaud the brave citizens who stepped forward to oppose this attack on our constitutional rights.” The suit was filed Monday afternoon in the United States District Court of the District of Massachusetts. Established in 1871, the National Rifle Association is America’s oldest civil rights and sportsmen’s group. More than five million members strong, NRA continues to uphold the Second Amendment and advocates enforcement of existing laws against violent offenders to reduce crime. The Association remains the nation’s leader in firearm education and training for law-abiding gun owners, law enforcement and the armed services.
