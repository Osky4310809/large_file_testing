Phillips’ resignation might serve to appease bills’ authors. \n‘’Obviously we don’t see the need in all this,” Phillips said Friday when asked about the bills. “We understand we’re not perfect and understand that there are some controversies within the body itself and rules that are made. … There’s always going to be some controversy here and there. That’s the way high school athletics unfortunately have evolved.’’ \nBoard member Tommy Stringer of Loganville, who voted to support Phillips, said other board members expressed no real personal dissatisfaction with Phillips but said his removal would ensure the GHSA’s existence and independence. Stringer said his own vote rejected that concern. \n”I don’t think the Georgia Legislature has any business dealing in Georgia High School Association affairs,” Stringer said. \nThose voting to recommend that Phillips resign were board president Glenn White, Model High principal in Rome; Gary Long , Mill Creek High athletics director in Gwinnett County; Don Corr of Cherokee County schools; Jesse Crews of Charlton County High and Benjy Rogers, Bleckley County athletics director in Cochran. \nVoting against were Stringer; Jim Finch, Mary Persons High principal in Forsyth; and Joe Lancaster of Jackson County. Vice president Lisa Moore Williams of Mableton and at-large trustee Wes Taylor of Valdosta did not attend. \nThe 10-member board includes seven representatives from each GHSA classification, a president, a vice-president and an at-large member. \nBoard president White could not be reached immediately for comment. Finch, who voted against the recommendation, was reached but declined comment except to say he was reserving judgment for now. \nMany of the GHSA’s decisions during Phillips’ tenure have been controversial, which is not unusual for any executive director. \nBuford and especially Jefferson were unhappy at the process and appeals procedures that led to those city schools being placed in higher classifications this academic year while most other city schools were unaffected. \nCartersville, a home school of bill-author Bruce Thornton (R-White), scrapped with Phillips in the spring of 2015 over a baseball decision. A playoff double-header between Cartersville and Wayne County was rained out, and Phillips ruled that it must be completed the next day, forcing Cartersville to return immediately to Jesup, rather than giving it more time. \nPhillips’ decision to enforce the GHSA’s bylaws and keep Wheeler’s boys basketball from participating in a post-season tournament in New York two years ago also caused a public outcry. Phillips changed course and gave special permission once legal action was threatened. \nThe GHSA also got a black eye during the 2016 state basketball finals when it was discovered that the baskets at the Macon Coliseum had been positioned incorrectly, about a foot too close to the baseline. Phillips elected to play on and not correct the mistake mid-event, which would’ve caused games to be delayed or postponed. \nPhillips is only the fifth GHSA executive director since 1946, but he would be the first to be forced out. Phillips succeeded Ralph Swearngin, who served from 2001 to 2014. \nPhillips assumed the directorship on July 1, 2014. His contracted was renewed a year later through 2017-18. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:35:04.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
