One man banged on his vehicle and was struck by the car. \nHe was taken to hospital but his injuries were minor, a police source told AFP. The injured fan later filed a formal complaint over the incident. \nAn investigation has been opened by French border police and on Thursday evening PSG released a statement in which they hit out at the behaviour of some of those who greeted them at the airport, while defending Motta. Paris Saint-Germain's Italian midfielder Thiago Motta \nThe club said their players “were confronted at Bourget airport by several individuals, despite the club and authorities reinforcing security. \n“These individuals verbally insulted the players before vandalising their cars. Several vehicles were damaged. \n“In this extremely hostile and aggressive climate, all vehicles were escorted to ensure the safe passage of the players, their families and club staff members.

Like we have always been, we are behind the club, the president, the coaching staff and the players to lift titles and cups, then come back stronger next season,” the group said in a statement sent to AFP. \nThe 6-1 defeat by Barcelona at the Camp Nou and the exit from the last 16 of the competition was a historic defeat for Qatari-owned PSG after they had won the first leg 4-0 in Paris, and has cast doubt over coach Unai Emery’s future at the club.
