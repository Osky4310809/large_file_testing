For every day in February, Cristi Smith-Jones dressed up her daughter as important black women .\nHer five-year-old daughter is channeling 28 of the most amazing black women in history — some who excelled in the arts and sciences, and some who fought for civil rights — all in the name of Black History Month . If you haven’t seen Smith-Jones’ fantastic photography project yet, get ready to be inspired.\nOn February 3rd, Smith-Jones wrote on Twitter:\n“Doing a Black History Month photo project w/ my 5 y.o.

Some standouts include abolitionist Harriet Tubman, political activist Angela Davis, entertainer Josephine Baker, and civil rights activist Rosa Parks.\nKent, WA mom empowers her daughter during #BlackHistoryMonth . 5 yr old recreates iconic photos - https://t.co/JoJ4a51ix8 #komonews pic.twitter.com/PZ8LkdunGY \n— Elisa Jaffe (@ElisaJaffe) February 22, 2017 Lola has even channeled two women whose stories have been told in Oscar-nominated movies in 2017 — activist Mildred Loving and mathematician Katherine Johnson.\nDay 14.
