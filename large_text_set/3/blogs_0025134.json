Lipa will be releasing her self-titled debut album in June.

Garrix and Lipa then took the stage, with the EDM DJ and producer playing guitar as Lipa belted out the subdued, vulnerable opening verse of the song. When the first drop hit after the chorus, turning the song into a euphoric dance track, Lipa headbanged and danced around the stage while singing to a guitar-strumming Garrix. \nThe 21-year-old Lipa has been releasing singles for her debut LP since 2015, including the hit singles \"Be the One\" and \"Hotter Than Hell.\" Last year, she collaborated with Sean Paul on \"No Lie\" and opened for Troye Sivan on his North American tour. Garrix released his third EP, Seven , last October and had a hit with the Bebe Rexha-sung single \"In the Name of Love.\" More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:19:46.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
