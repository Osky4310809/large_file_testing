After all, they're so affordable, so we can't do too much financial damage. But Ulta Beauty recently revealed a sale that is positively dangerous to our wallets: a BOGO. \nYes, that's right: for the purchase of one face or eye product from the brand, you can get one of equal or lesser value free. This deal is available in stores and online , and even better (or worse?), there doesn't seem to be any shopping restrictions, so you can really go hard on a beauty swag shopping spree. \nIf you've been meaning to try the Away We Glow liquid highlighters or Total Control Foundation , now's your chance! Even better, you'll be able to take home some bonus items, too. Just know that this BOGO sale ends March 4, so you only have a few days to get your shop on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:09:06.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
