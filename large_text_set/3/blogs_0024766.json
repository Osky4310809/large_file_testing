Jackson 03/21/17 07:11 PM EDT \nThe health care debate on Capitol Hill neared its endgame today, as President Donald Trump delivered a warning despite many members of the House Freedom Caucus appearing undaunted. \nTrump trekked to Capitol Hill today to press his case ahead of Thursday’s vote. He formally asked lawmakers for support but also warned them that nothing less than their seats are on the line if they don’t support the bill, POLITICO’s Rachael Bade, Kyle Cheney and John Bresnahan report . \n“He warned that if Republicans don't pass the bill, ‘I honestly think many of you will lose your seats in 2018.’” \nStill the outcome is anyone’s guess , with House leadership and the White House still short of the votes they would need to complete the repeal vote. The furious lobbying is likely to continue into the 11th hour. \nTrump’s warnings highlighted one of the undercurrents of the health care debate: The president’s penchant for vengeance. Winning Trump’s favor — or potentially losing it in perpetuity — is something every Republican lawmaker will have to consider, POLITICO’s Shane Goldmacher reports . \n“Those close to Trump describe his largely binary worldview: you’re either on Team Trump or against Team Trump. ‘Get even with people,’ Trump outlined his philosophy in a 2011 speech . ‘If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe it.’” \nTrump has shown flexibility on the overall shape of the health care legislation — but as his trip to the Hill today and travels to Kentucky and elsewhere to press his case shows, he wants the repeal done. \nElsewhere in Donald Trump’s orbit: \nSUPREME AGILITY: Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch skirted questions about guns, abortion rights and voting rights — while also pledging to be independent of President Donald Trump. (More key moments from Gorsuch’s hearing here .) \nMAN OF INTEREST: A lot of people would like to talk to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. And a Ukrainian lawmaker released new financial documents showing ties between Manafort and Russia. ( Washington Post ) \nREX IN EFFECT: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has ruffled seasoned diplomats and has many wondering about the future of the State Department after his early tenure in Foggy Bottom. \nOPPOSITION PARTY: Outside groups like the Club for Growth and Heritage Action still oppose the House’s Obamacare repeal and replace legislation. \nOH, COMEY ON: FBI Director James Comey’s disavowal notwithstanding, some Republicans still back President Trump’s wiretapping assertions. \nHOUSE (STILL) DIVIDED: Trump’s advisers are still divided over a potential carbon tax. \nAnd there you have it, you’re caught up on the the Trump administration.
