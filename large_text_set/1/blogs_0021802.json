And they haven’t had a pay hike in years. \nBut the fact is, state government is not a private corporation, with salaries and stockholder dividends that can rise or fall depending on profit margins. It is a public, non-profit entity funded mostly by taxpayers, not by speculative investors. And it’s mission is not to turn a profit – it is to manage the Commonwealth properly, according to priorities that can be drastically different from those of a private corporation. \nSurely, one of those priorities ought to be helping needy families caring for severely, chronically-ill children afford continuing nursing care. There are about 900 families in our state who fit that bill, and their stories are daunting and heartbreaking. But the nursing reimbursement these families receive hadn’t been raised in ten years until the state, under pressure from advocates, threw them a one dollar-an-hour bone recently. \nEighteen million dollars to raise the pay of lawmakers and judges who are in no danger of missing a meal, before doing right by these heroic families and their caregivers? \nSomething is very wrong with this picture.
