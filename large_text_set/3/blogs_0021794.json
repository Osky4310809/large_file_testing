US BLS ID: 10577135 Despite the uncertainty, animal rights activists are celebrating a major win for the movement. “The fact is that the largest egg buyers all have clear policies requiring their suppliers to stop locking hens in cages by 2025,” Humane Society spokesperson Matthew Prescott told BuzzFeed News. “Unless egg producers want to lose business, they’ll simply need to convert.”\nThe industry’s transition ramped up in 2015 after McDonald’s (which buys about 3% of all the eggs in the US) announced it would transition to cage-free eggs by 2025 “to improve the treatment of animals.” Walmart made the same commitment the following April, and months later grocery chain Publix said its egg selection would go cage-free by 2026. The rest of the food business followed.\nYet egg industry representatives claim builders and equipment suppliers will have a hard time keeping pace with these pledges. Some believe it simply won’t work. “The 2026 deadline for 220 million hens to transition from conventional cages to cage-free is physically and financially impossible,” said Gregory.\nView this image ›\nAn example of cage-free housing.

In 2011, United Egg Producers formed an unlikely partnership with the Humane Society to try to pass a federal egg bill that would transition the entire industry, by law, from conventional cages to “enriched colony” cages, which offer more space and amenities like perches, nesting boxes and scratching areas.\nThe cost for enriched colony housing would average out to $20-25 per bird, more than the $15 average for conventional cages, but still half as much as a cage-free system. The proposal was to make the industry-wide switch by by 2030.\nThe proposal didn’t work, and the industry now faces a costlier transition.\nCal-Maine Foods, which accounts for about a quarter of US egg consumption, broke out the projected costs of a number of cage-free projects in its last annual report, ranging from $3.1 million to $49.6 million. Cal-Maine also estimated its joint venture for 1.8 million cage-free hens will cost $73 million to build and start up.\nCal-Maine projects View this image ›\n*Figures in thousands. Cal-Maine Foods\nID: 10547384 An oft-cited case study is California, where voters banned battery cages in the state starting 2015. Not long after, Modern Farmer reported , “The legislature recognized that the law would put California egg farmers out of business, forcing them to spend lots of cash to upgrade their facilities while competing with out-of-state producers that weren’t subject to the regulation (and the attendant investments and price increases it would entail). So the law was expanded to cover all eggs sold in the state.”\nIn effect, to guarantee the success of cage-free eggs, California had to make them the only option. By some estimates, the law caused egg prices to rise between 33% and 70%.\nStill, the movement has continued to spread. In November, Massachusetts voters approved a ballot to prohibit the sale of eggs, pork and veal raised in small, confined spaces.\nActivists say public opinion eventually overrides the difficult economics of the cage-free business. “At the end of the day,” said Prescott, of the Humane Society, “the least profitable or economical type of product to produce is the kind no one will buy.”\nView this image ›\nPaul J.
