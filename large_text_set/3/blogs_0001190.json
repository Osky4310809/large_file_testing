Perhaps you're planning a Christmas family devotional, or just looking for Bible verses to write in your Christmas cards. This collection of Christmas Bible verses is arranged according to various themes and events surrounding the Christmas story and the birth of Jesus . \nIf presents, wrapping paper, mistletoe, and Santa Clause are distracting you from the true reason for this season, take a few minutes to meditate on these Christmas Bible verses and make Christ the central focus of your Christmas this year. The Birth of Jesus \nMatthew 1:18-25 \nThis is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph , but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. \nBut after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\" \nAll this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: \"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel \"—which means, \"God with us.\" \nWhen Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus. (KJV) \nLuke 2:1-14 \nIn those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went to his own town to register. \nSo Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger , because there was no room for them in the inn. \nAnd there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, \"Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.\" \nSuddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.\" (KJV) The Visit of the Shepherds \nLuke 2:15-20 \nWhen the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, \"Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.\" \nSo they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. \nBut Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. (KJV) The Visit of the Magi (Wise Men) \nMatthew 2:1-12 \nAfter Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod , Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, \"Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.\" \nWhen King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born. \"In Bethlehem in Judea,\" they replied, \"for this is what the prophet has written:\"'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;for out of you will come a rulerwho will be the shepherd of my people Israel.'\" \nThen Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, \"Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.\" \nAfter they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh . And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route. (KJV) Peace on Earth \nGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. (KJV) Immanuel \nIsaiah 7:14 \nTherefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. (KJV) \nMatthew 1:23 \nBehold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. (KJV) The Gift of Eternal Life \n1 John 5:11 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. (NIV) \nRomans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (NASB) \nJohn 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (NIV) \nTitus 3:4-7 But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit , whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. (NKJV) \nJohn 10:27-28 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me. (NLT) \n1 Timothy 1:15-17 Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen. (NIV) The Birth of Jesus Foretold \nIsaiah 40:1-11 \nComfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins. \nThe voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. \nEvery valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: \nAnd the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. \nThe voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever. \nO Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! \nBehold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. \nHe shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young. (KJV) \nLuke 1:26-38 \nIn the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, \"Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.\" \nMary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. But the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.\" \n\"How will this be,\" Mary asked the angel, \"since I am a virgin?\" \nThe angel answered, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month. For nothing is impossible with God.\" \n\"I am the Lord's servant,\" Mary answered. \"May it be to me as you have said.\" Then the angel left her. (KJV) Mary Visits Elizabeth \nLuke 1:39-45 \nAt that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, where she entered Zechariah 's home and greeted Elizabeth . When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!\" (KJV) Mary's Song", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T19:31:23.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
