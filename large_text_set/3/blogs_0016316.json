We're soon introduced to the rest of the cast, including the rapidly escalating feud between Tex Ferguson (Luke Gallows) and Chadd 2 Badd (Karl Anderson), as well as Big Bartholomew (Rusev), a small town Southern farmer who just so happens to have a thick European accent. \nOf course, ultimately these videos contain not-so-thinly-veiled advertisements for KFC, recited by a \"Ric Flair impersonator\" who sounds an awful lot like the real Flair (\"WOO! Crispy! WOO! Tangy!\"). But advertisement or not, the hilarious absurdity of \"Southpaw\" is infectious and proves that WWE Superstars are just as funny as they are athletic.
