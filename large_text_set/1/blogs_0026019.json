(credit: Jackson Galaxy Foundation) \nPAWS Executive Director Melissa Levy says although it’s common for shelter dogs to get rewards-based enrichment training, when it comes to cats, “It’s much rarer to find an actual program to enrich them and engage them, give them something fun to focus on, and actually develop some skills while they’re in the shelter.” \nAmong the skills: helping shy cats come out of their shells, and teaching outgoing kitties to give high fives. \nWeekly training sessions for human staff and volunteers start February 2nd, led by an expert in feline behavior. \nLevy’s looking forward to seeing the results, when the feline students show off their skills to potential adopters. \n“How will the cats interact with them, and maybe put their best paw forward, to find a new home,” Levy said.
