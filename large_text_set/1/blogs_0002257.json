Facebook/Kat De Castro \n  The Philippine government will not hide homeless Filipinos during the Miss Universe pageant in the country this month, the Department of Tourism (DOT) said on Tuesday. \nTourism Secretary Wanda Teo said that the government will not hide street dwellers, as was allegedly done for past international events. \n\"In fact, we would like to show them this is the Philippines,\" Teo said in an interview with CNN Philippines' The Source. \nTeo added that most candidates in the Miss Universe pageant not from rich countries. \n\"Sila naman din they have also the squatters, they also have the homeless in their country. Hindi naman sila mayayaman din, so we would let them see that the reality that we are not a rich country,\" Teo said. \nIn 2015, the Department of Social Welfare and Development drew flak for reportedly hiding around 500 street children during Pope Francis' visit.   \nThe street children, along with their families, were sent to a resort in a Nasugbu, Batangas. The DSWD, however, claimed that the resort stay was a \"family camping workshop\" for the poor. \nThe Tourism secretary also noted that the government is not spending any money for hosting the beauty pageant. \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte initially refused to host the event due to the expenses. \n\"We are not spending any money. That was my promise to the president,\" the Tourism chief said. \nThe president told Teo that he would rather give the money to the poor instead of spending $11 million for hosting the Miss Universe pageant. \nThe DOT started looking for sponsors when the president refused to spend government funds for hosting the event, Teo said. \nThe Miss Universe 2016 coronation night will be held at the SM Mall of Asia Arena on January 30.
