He said he could not release the filings as he was under audit. \nDemocrats hinted that by not releasing the documents, Trump may be trying to hide that he pays little to no tax, makes less money than he claims, or gives a negligible amount to charity.\nIn January, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the White House would not release the documents.\nTrump said his taxes are not of interest to the general public.\n\"You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters,\" he said during a news conference after his January 20 inauguration.\nAhead of the November election, The New York Times published what it said were leaked tax filings from 1995 that revealed a deficit big enough for Trump not to pay federal income taxes for up to 18 years.\nIn the first presidential debate, when Hillary Clinton accused him of not having paid federal tax in years, Trump responded, \"That makes me smart\".\nHis administration hit back at MSNBC on Tuesday.\n\"You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,\" it said in a statement.\nThe unauthorised release of federal tax returns is a criminal offense. But Maddow argued that MSNBC was exercising its First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:57:35.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
