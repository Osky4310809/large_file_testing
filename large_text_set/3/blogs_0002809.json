The punishment for breaking such a restraining order could be jail time for Brown. \nIt was previously reported that Tran filed a restraining order against Brown back in February of this year. Additional reports showed that Tran’s friend also filed a restraining order against the singer. \nHis ex is reportedly willing to take the stand during their appearance in front of a judge. \nIn sworn statements, the singer’s ex claimed that Brown “told a few people that he was going to kill” her and also “threatened to shoot” her. Tran also alleged that Brown was physically violent, claiming that he pushed her down a flight of stairs at one point. \nBrown responded to the initial reports on Instagram , vaguely addressing “this bullshit” and telling his fans not to listen to “what the people on the other side doing.” \nThe claims against Brown come over eight years after his assault on Rihanna in 2009. He received five years probation for his attack on the singer.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:50:03.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
