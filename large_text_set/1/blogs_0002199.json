Tracy Claeys was fired as head coach Tuesday, despite a reasonably successful 9-4 season, in the wake of an ongoing sexual assault investigation surrounding some of his players and his team's near-boycott of the Holiday Bowl in reaction to the university's suspension of those and other players. \nClaeys publically sided with the players during the boycott, which certainly colors all the comments you're about to see. But it's clear the Minnesota players are angry in the aftermath of Tuesday's news, as several took to Twitter to share their feelings. Some simply supported Claeys.
