According to A. Sherrod Blakely of CSN New England, the Boston Celtics are one of several teams checking on Butler's availability. Any trade would apparently require a combination of \"high draft picks and young veterans.\" Butler was selected to his third straight All-Star Game this season and is averaging a career-high 24.5 points per game. The 27-year-old is also averaging 6.3 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game, which would also be the best marks of his six-year career. Per Basketball Reference , he is currently seventh in the NBA with 9.2 win shares, ahead of LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry , among others. While the Bulls are in position for a playoff spot, their 28-29 record doesn't indicate a deep run in the playoffs is likely. The squad could try to deal its star player in exchange for a big return that might facilitate a rebuild. Conversely, Boston is a team that could contend for a title after going into the All-Star break just three games behind the first-place Cleveland Cavaliers. An Eastern Conference executive said the Celtics are \"not pressed to do anything unless it makes them a lot better,\" per Blakely. Butler would make the team a lot better, and he remains under contract through 2019 with an option for the 2019-20 season.
