It’s one for the history books, the day that an American president gave a public performance so nutty, so bizarre, so full of malignant narcissism and wild invention that it boggles the mind and rattles the teeth. \nIn a 77-minute rant, Donald Trump defended his madcap administration as entirely sane, as if the firing of Mike Flynn, the collapse of Andrew Puzder’s cabinet candidacy, the ethics violation of Kellyanne Conway, the sinister stylings of Steve Bannon’s executive orders, the fight with the intelligence community, the battle with the judiciary, the posturing againt the media, the ongoing questions about Russia’s connection to his campaign, were not happening. \nRemember people: His administration is not yet four weeks old. Also Read: President Trump Bashes 'Out of Control' Media: 'I Inherited a Mess' \nEvery question Trump took from a journalist was accompanied by a dig at the said journalist. He couldn’t take a question without insulting the person asking it. The CNN reporter had bad ratings. He called an orthodox Jewish journalist — the kind with the sidecurls and the black suit — a liar. He called on an African-American journalist and then asked her to set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. He dodged every question on Russia. And he said that Mike Flynn — who HE fired — didn’t do anything wrong, really. \nThe press conference, it has been reported, was a surprise to Trump’s own staff. So here’s how this went: The president tossed and turned all night, raging internally at the unfairness of it all. And he got up determined to set the world straight. To make sure everyone understood that he’s a good guy getting a bad rap. \nBut really, it was like upside down day. Like opposite day. Trump as the Mad Hatter, spinning an alternative reality without the goggles. \nHe denied that his White House was in chaos, as if he felt compelled to counter, verbatim, the New York Times whose headline said exactly that. \n“There’s zero chaos,” he protested. The administration is a “fine-tuned machine.” Also Read: Trump Fans Want Shepard Smith's Head for Slamming President on Fox News \nIt got nuttier from there. \nOn Flynn: “The leaks are real. The news is fake.” (As others have pointed out, this is not possible. If the leaks are real, then the news they are leaking can’t be fake.”) \n“I’m not a bad person.” \n“I’m actually having a very good time. “ \n“I inherited a mess.” \n“I’m the least anti-Semitic person you’ve ever seen in your entire life.” \nOn Russia: “A nuclear holocaust would be like no other.” \nEvery day in Trump Administration time is like a month for any other presidency I’ve witnessed. \nBut today, our obstreperous and unhinged commander in chief must surely be giving some sleepless nights not to his enemies, but to his Republican friends. \nYou can watch the whole thing here, but remember you don’t get those minutes back: 8 Unflattering Things Late Night Hosts Compared Trump 'Henchman' Stephen Miller To (Photos) \nOver the weekend, Trump adviser Stephen Miller went on Sunday morning shows to push the president's border policies. Late-night hosts were not impressed by his chilly claim that \"the powers of our president to protect our country... will not be questioned,\" and compared him to some unflattering people, places and cartoon characters. For example... \n\"Sméagol in a suit\" - Trevor Noah \nTwo-thirds of Montgomery Burns - Seth Meyers \n(Exact quote: \"That guy is 31 years old and he already looks like he's two-thirds of the way to Montgomery Burns.\") \n\"Young Gargamel\" (you know, from \"The Smurfs\") - Stephen Colbert \n\nSuperman villain General Zod - Stephen Colbert \n(Context: After making the Gargamel comment, Colbert played a video of the previously mentioned Stephen Miller quote. Then Colbert joked that Miller then added, \"I am become death, destroyer of worlds. Kneel before Zod.\" Which is a combo of famous quotes by Robert Oppenheimer and Zod.) \n\"The guy who shows up with a flashlight when teens are getting drunk in a graveyard.\" - Seth Meyers \nA foot - Trevor Noah \n(Exact quote: \"If you're wondering why his face looks familiar, it's probably because you see him every time you take off our socks. Black people, you can ignore that joke.\") \n\"A basic henchman\" - Trevor Noah \n\"A guilty husband who got caught texting with a female co-worker.\" - Seth Meyer \nWe'll keep updating this list as more Stephen Miller insults roll in.
