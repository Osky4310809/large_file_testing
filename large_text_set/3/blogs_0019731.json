Mayor Muriel Bowser at the HEIST pop-up lounge in the WeDC House at SXSW. (HEIST) Hey isn’t that … Muriel Bowser at South by Southwest in Austin?\nThe D.C. mayor stopped by the HEIST pop-up at the WeDC House (the District’s showcase space at the arts, technology and innovation festival series) on Sunday to highlight local entrepreneurs and techies exhibiting there. The mayor ditched her usual business garb in favor of jeans, boots, a black jacket, and a cap with HEIST emblazoned on it, repping the swanky D.C. lounge/event host. DJ Jazzy Jeff provided entertainment for the affair that also drew VIPs such as Wu-Tang Clan.\nWhile visiting the WeDC showcase, Bowser announced the grand opening of D.C.’s “ Inclusive Innovation Incubator ” in April, a community space aimed at spurring tech development.\nOf course, no trip to Texas is complete without some good old-fashioned barbecue, so the mayor made a pit-stop at Austin’s famous Franklin BBQ while also attending the U.S. Conference of Mayors.", "external_links": ["https://www.in3dc.com/"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:36:12.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
