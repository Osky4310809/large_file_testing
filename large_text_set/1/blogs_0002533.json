Hull 0 Chelsea 2, October 1 \nAfter the struggling Tigers held out for an hour, Willian broke the deadlock and Diego Costa quickly added a second to end a three-match winless run. View gallery Chelsea 3 Leicester 0, October 15 \nIt is remarkable to recall now that before this win over the reigning Premier League champions, some bookmakers had suspended betting on manager Antonio Conte to be sacked. Costa scored an early opener, Eden Hazard doubled the lead before half-time and Victor Moses, suddenly a key player as a wing-back in Conte's new formation, rounded off the win. View gallery Chelsea 4 Manchester United 0, October 23 \nPedro's goal after only 30 seconds sparked a statement win, with Gary Cahill doubling the lead before the interval and Hazard and N'Golo Kante piling on the misery for ex-Blues boss Jose Mourinho. View gallery Southampton 0 Chelsea 2, October 30 \nThe run was interrupted by a League Cup exit against West Ham but in the league, goals from Hazard and Costa ensured Conte's side marched on. View gallery Chelsea 5 Everton 0, November 5 \nFive wins, and five goals on November 5. The rejuvenated Hazard was central to the fireworks, scoring the first and fourth with Marcos Alonso, Costa and Pedro also on target.

View gallery Chelsea 2 Tottenham 1, November 26 \nChristian Eriksen's opener was the first goal Chelsea had conceded in the run but Pedro and Moses responded. Spurs will have another chance to halt Chelsea's momentum on Wednesday. View gallery Manchester City 1 Chelsea 3, December 3 \nCahill's own goal left Chelsea with work to do but he redeemed himself with a goal-line clearance before Costa brilliantly equalised, Willian and Hazard sealed victory and a late City meltdown saw Sergio Aguero and Fernandinho sent off. View gallery Chelsea 1 West Brom 0, December 11 \nAlbion defended deep and battled hard but Costa finally broke through in the 76th minute with another excellent finish. View gallery Sunderland 0 Chelsea 1, December 14 \nCesc Fabregas scored the only goal five minutes before half time but it took a brilliant late save by Thibaut Courtois to deny Patrick van Aanholt an equaliser and take the winning sequence into double figures. View gallery Crystal Palace 0 Chelsea 1, December 17 \nThe fixtures were coming thick and fast but Chelsea were not to be derailed as Costa's header clinched three points. View gallery Chelsea 3 Bournemouth 0, December 26 \nPedro scored twice and Hazard won and converted a penalty in a club-record 12th straight Premier League win. View gallery Chelsea 4 Stoke 2, December 31 \nGoals from Cahill and Willian were cancelled out by Bruno Martins Indi and Peter Crouch as Chelsea conceded as many goals as in their previous 12 games. The Brazilian scored again, though, before Costa added a late fourth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T15:59:38.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
