Picture: Michael Klein \n“When you’ve got the likes of a Heppell, a Watson, the guys that play the majority in the midfield, you’ve got young Zach Merrett coming through — I’m not sure where BJ fits into that side right now. \n“I don’t know how long he can play for if he’s constantly getting moved around. \n“I’m not concerned because he is a quality player and a quality person. But yes, I think he needs to find a position that is his again.” \nDal Santo said he watched the Bombers take on Collingwood in the first JLT Community Series game of the season and noticed Goddard was “getting moved around a little bit”. \n“He’s an amazing player, his greatest asset over the years — one has been his skill level, which means he can play in multiple positions,” Dal Santo said. \n“But he does play in multiple positions, he’s been able to fill those gaps — we used to call him Selleys ... because he’d just fill in wherever you needed him.” \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.
