There's been so much chemistry and build-up – it's going to be amazing,\" she added. \nBut her plans may fall short when she learns inmates are not permitted to have sex in prison grounds under the Incentives and Earned Privileges scheme. \nJoey – short for Joseph – has been in jail since 2010 after being convicted of aggravated burglary, kidnap, ABH and possession of a firearm. Joey was jailed for a string of crimes, including possession of a firearm and aggravated burglary (Photo: Internet Unknown) But the reality star claims everyone needs to give him another chance (Photo: Instagram) \nHe and an accomplice were sentenced to 16 years in jail, but it's thought Joey will be released before March 2018 after serving half his term. \nAt the time of his arrest, he was caught with £60,000 worth of cocaine and £10,000 in cash – but Lauren has previously said that she's not bothered by his criminal past. \nOn Channel 5's In Therapy this January, she admitted that her friends have warned her to steer clear of her \"controlling\" boyfriend.
