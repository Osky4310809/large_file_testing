(AP Photo/Seth Perlman) \nFrustrated with the tight labor market in St. Charles, local businesses are sending recruiters 116 miles away to lure workers from small-town America. \nThe city of St. Charles Economic Development office is planning a job fair in Effingham , Ill., a town of 12,000 people, on March 28. \nSt. Charles manufacturers such as Craftsmen Industries, LMI Aerospace, Patriot Machine and Trinity Products hope to hire there. Ameristar Casino, Embassy Suites hotels and the St. Charles Convention Center are also sending recruiters. \nThe St. Louis metro unemployment rate hit 4.3 percent in November, a 15-year low. The rate in St. Charles County was 2.8 percent, not adjusted for seasonal changes. \nSt. Charles businesses are finding it hard to recruit in the metro area, said David Leezer, St. Charles economic development director. Workers are jumping from company to company for better pay, he said, while the supply of trained workers isn’t expanding. \nA recruiting trip to farm country is unusual for metro area employers. “I don’t know of anybody who has done this before. But what we’re doing now is not working,” he said. \nEffingham is known for a 198-foot cross that towers over the town. Leezer is hoping to find millennials bored with small town life who think, “I want to go some place exciting like St. Louis.” Industrial recruiters like “women and men who grew up on farms and can work on anything,” said Leezer. \nEconomic development and St. Charles Chamber of Commerce officials will be on hand to answer questions about living in St. Charles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T08:48:03.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
