Let me start at the beginning, however, with your name, Dom Tullipso, which is not your real name. It’s a fake name, we ran you through law enforcement-level background checks and that name does not exist. So let’s start out with the truth. Tell me what your real name is.” \nOkay, let’s back up a second. \nCarlson invited the man identifying himself as Dom Tullipso on his show to talk about this new group that’s popped up called Demand Protest . It says on the site, “When your strategy demands paid protest, we organize and bring it to life.” \nA few sites picked up on supposed ads this group was passing around reading “Get paid fighting against Trump!” However, it seems pretty clear this is a hoax . \nThe back-and-forth between Carlson and “Tullipso” was kind of amazing, and this was the moment when Carlson realized he was witnessing performance art before his very eyes: \n“We are greatly, greatly supportive of national treasures such as Julian Assange , Edward Snowden , and Peyton Manning , and we really support their efforts to really get the truth out there, and in the case of the current client we have right now, uh, that client is, um, very interested in releasing the Roswell papers.” \nOh, and in case you’re wondering if the reference to Peyton Manning instead of Chelsea was a slip-up, he did it again a bit later, after he actually said, “We shifted from being against Trump to Trump about 30 minutes ago.” \nBut towards the end of the interview, even Carlson’s guest couldn’t help but admit his surprise that he was invited on TV in the first place. After, of course, he said this: \n“We are now supporting Trump in the hope that the Roswell documents from 1947 are finally released and put back into the hands of Fisher Stevens.” \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:54:02.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
