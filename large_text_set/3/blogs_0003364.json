Remy Ma March 4, 2017 | 9:28 AM 63 \nRemy Ma torched the Hip Hop landscape this week with her “SHETHER” and “Another One” diss tracks slathering all sorts of insults on Nicki Minaj. \nHer use of Nas’“Ether” instrumental is debatable , and so is the question of whether Nicki even cares enough to respond to the seven-minute onslaught. \nJudging by Nicki’s Instagram feed since the tracks dropped, she seems to be going about business as usual.

Only time will only tell. But one thing we do know for sure is that numbers don’t lie. Both the Queens rapper and BX Bomber have had various levels of success either commercially or in the streets. Remy Ma is only two years Nicki’s elder (36 vs. 34), although her track record might make her seem more of an OG than her pop-friendly rival. But they have both had significant milestones throughout their careers.
