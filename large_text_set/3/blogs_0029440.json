Obviously, that wasn’t what his many opponents had in mind. After a sustained, multiyear effort, it looks as if they will finally be able to put into action the much better plan they have no doubt spent countless hours crafting, to make things extra excellent because they love us all so much. \nPaul Ryan’s plan is meeting resistance from a lot of places, perhaps some even he didn’t anticipate. \nAnything with numbers and charts quickly goes over my head. It has always been this way. To try to get an understanding of governmental maneuverings in the USA, I always look at the country’s history and its streets instead. \nWhen you look at how the country was founded and quickly rose to top global shot-caller, it is easy to see that there is not going to be a health care system that will deliver on the promises of any president. It would be bad public relations for the slightly nicer Spicer to tell the press corps the truth about health care — that no matter what bills are passed, America is simply not designed for a great majority of the population to be healthy. \nIt sucks that the entire economy is based on dependency, financial insecurity, lifelong debt, incarceration, prolonged global conflicts, bad health, poor personal care and lethal foodstuffs. Remember what all those beansprout eaters were called decades ago? Health food freaks. That’s the gastrointestinal equivalent of “Looks like we got ourselves a reader ...” \nIf America really wanted to lower the cost of health care, it wouldn’t be cheap and it wouldn’t be overnight, but it is possible. It would take a generation or two, but it would be possible to wean the citizens off diets that are hard on the body and give little in return. Michelle Obama tried. Sarah Palin called it a “war on dessert.” \nNothing in this country is easy, besides things like falling into credit card debt or ending up in prison. Good food is expensive. It is, in fact, out of the price range of many families clinging tenaciously to the lower rungs of the middle class. Cheap food is plentiful, but it’s cheap for a reason. Health care, like justice, is for those who can pay for a favorable outcome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:30:36.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
