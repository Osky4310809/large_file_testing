First launched last October, the K1600 B is BMW Motorrad’s take on a bagger-style touring bike, and aimed squarely at the US market. \nDrawn from the Concept 101 prototype and carrying the latest iteration of Motorrad’s inline-six, the K1600 B’s power plant puts out 160 hp at 7,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 175 Nm at 5,250 rpm. The bagger design lowers the silhouette of the original K1600 GT touring bike considerably, with a seat height only 740 mm, a full 70 mm lower that the K1600 GT. \nThe side cases are integrated into the bodywork, and feature side openings for easy loading. This is coupled with a rear mudguard that slides out of the way to allow for easy removal of the rear wheel. \nA full suit of BMW Motorrad’s electronic wizardry comes with the K1600 B, including Dynamic ESA electronically controlled damping with “Road” and “Cruise” modes. Available as ex-works options are a starter-operated reverse function and Shift Assistant Pro for shifting up and down without using the clutch while an electrically adjustable windshield is standard. \nAn extensive range of options is also available for the K1600 B from the official Motorrad catalogue, and we assume the aftermarket will not be far behind in offering their versions of bling for this bagger. No word from BMW Motorrad on what the K1600 B might cost, but with the K1600 GTL retailing for RM167,900 , the K1600 B will definitely not be far behind. Coming with diverse and extensive experience in heavy engineering, Mohan enjoys making anything with wheels go fast, especially motorcycles. His weapon of choice is the Desmoquattro engine, and he has a penchant for anything with a dash of Italian design. Strangely enough, he insists he's a slow rider.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T14:28:30.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
