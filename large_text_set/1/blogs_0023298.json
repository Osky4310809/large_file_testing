Now is the time to speak up for refugees? Now? Where was this cry for justice during the election? Where was the consult from all of the Christians who prayed at president Trump’s inauguration? It’s not like these policies are any surprise! These were solid promises made repeatedly from every stump speech along the campaign trail. Where was the collective Christian concern and outrage over the dying refugee orphans then? \nAccording to Pew Research , President Trump received almost 60% of the Christian vote – more votes than Romney, McCain, or Bush ever received from America’s “Moral Majority!” So, I must ask – how did this refugee ban come to be? Weren’t all of the major Christian leaders crying out for justice for these refugees during the campaign? Weren’t they all questioning the convenient faith of a known charlatan? Oh, that’s right – all of the biggest Christian leaders like Franklin Graham, Timothy Dolan and Jerry Falwell Jr. were busy kissing the ring of their future king, all while folks like Kirk Cameron and Dr. Ben Carson used emotional blackmail to push the MyFaithVotes.org campaign of Christian one-party protectionism. Where were the Christians concerned for the security and well-being of innocent men, women and children then? The simple fact of the matter is that the majority of Christians (who make up the “moral majority” of our country) knowingly voted for this refugee ban to become reality. Period. From a numbers perspective, yes, Christian voters are largely to blame for this problem, so they had better figure out a way to own up to their responsibility and fix it! \nDon’t get me wrong – I know that the refugee community will wholeheartedly accept any help from the Christian community they can get. NOW! So, if you really want to do something to help the most vulnerable and at-risk populations of the world, pick up your phone, call your congressional leaders and demand that they overturn Trump’s “extreme vetting” order – immediately ! It’s easy… just pick up the phone!
