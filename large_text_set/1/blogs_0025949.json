That's why we haven't got one. \n\"Hopefully Reece Oxford will go on loan to Reading today,\" he added, referring to the promising 18-year-old. \n\"The manager there [former Manchester United and Netherlands centre-back Jaap Stam] was really important for me in that decision.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:25:31.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
