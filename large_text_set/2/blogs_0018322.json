This is a great responsibility and an amazing opportunity. I’m looking forward immensely to protecting and serving the people of London and working again with the fabulous women and men of the Met. \n“Thank you so much to everyone who has taught me and supported me along the way.” Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is stepping down at the end of this week (Lucy Young) \nMs Dick, who is highly respected among colleagues, left the Met in 2014 to take up a senior and sensitive role at the Foreign Office after she was moved from her counter terrorism post by Sir Bernard. \nShe beat competition from three shortlisted rivals, the current Met counter terror chief Mark Rowley, Essex chief constable Stephen Kavanagh and Sara Thornton, head of the National Police Chiefs' Council. Cressida Dick profile: High-flier thrust into national spotlight \nMs Dick becomes Met commissioner as the force faces challenges of a new round of £400 million Government spending cuts, the ongoing threat of an Islamist terror attack and rising crime rates. \nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “Cressida Dick will be the first female Commissioner of the Met in its 187-year history, and the most powerful police officer in the land. \n\"She has already had a long and distinguished career, and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process. \n\"On behalf of all Londoners, I warmly welcome Cressida to the role and I very much look forward to working with her to keep our capital safe and protected. \n“This is a historic day for London and a proud day for me as Mayor. \n\"The Metropolitan Police do an incredible job, working hard with enormous dedication every single day to keep Londoners safe, so for me it was absolutely essential that we found the best possible person to take the Met forward over the coming years and I am confident that we have succeeded.” \nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said: “Cressida Dick is an exceptional leader. Cressida now takes on one of the most demanding, high-profile and important jobs in UK policing. \n“She is absolutely the right choice to lead the Metropolitan Police.\" She was appointed ahead of the Met's counter-terror chief Mark Rowley who was also in the running for the post \nOutgoing chief Sir Bernard, who is stepping down at the end of this week after six years in the job, told the Standard last week that the Commissioner may have to introduce NHS-style “rationing” of its services to Londoners and cut thousands of police officers to meet the budget cuts. \nMs Dick, who is single, will take charge of the 32,000 strong Met in the coming weeks. \nHer appointment comes despite objections from the de Menezes family who wrote to Sadiq Khan last week saying she would not “command public confidence” if she got the job. \nDuring a hunt for four suspects of a failed suicide bombing on the London Underground in 2005, armed officers mistook Mr de Menezes for one of the terrorists and shot him while he sat in a Tube carriage at Stockwell underground station. \nOfficers believed he was would-be suicide bomber Hussain Osman who lived in the same block of flats as the Brazilian. When the force was later found guilty of breaching health and safety laws, the jury cleared Ms Dick of blame. \nThe daughter of two Oxford dons she graduated from the university’s Balliol College and briefly worked for an accountancy firm before joining the Met in 1983. \nShe has held a variety of senior positions in the force including heading the Trident gang unit and overseeing the successful re-investigation of the Stephen Lawrence murder. \nHer appointment means that for the first time all three top policing jobs in the UK are held by women: the Met Commissioner, the head of the National Crime Agency and the president of the National Police Chief’s Council.
