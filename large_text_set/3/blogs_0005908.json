Here are some things you should be looking out for, apart from great chemistry, before you take your relationship forward. 1. Communication \nHow well can you communicate with each other is going to be a big driving force in your equation. Make sure you are in a space where you can have open, honest conversations before you get serious. 2. Commitment \nA good relationship needs hard work, and both people involved need to make the same amount of efforts. The relationship cannot survive if one person is more committed to making it work, than the other. 3. Respect \nSure, you get along really well and understand where each one of you comes from, but is there solid respect in the relationship? Ask yourself this question, because you need someone who is going to be proud of who you are, respect your every decision, and not try to change you as a person. 4. Relationship with family and friends \nApart from the two of you getting along, you also need to make sure your significant other makes efforts to gel with the people who are important to you. A relationship is mainly about the two of you, but these are the people who matter to you. And if your partner refuses to make efforts to include them in his/her life, you need a rethink. 5. Compatibility \nPeople often assume that compatibility and chemistry are two interchangeable traits. Compatibility can best be measured by the similarities in both your lives that bring you together, whereas chemistry is more of an emotional bond. At the end of the day you need to make sure that you have similar values, and you both are on the same page in order to make this work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T13:39:26.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
