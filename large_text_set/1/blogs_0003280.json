But funny is funny. So when some people over at Reddit asked what it would look like if historical world leaders had access to social media and tweeted like Donald Trump, I knew I was in for something oddly special. The fact is, Donald loves to Tweet his opinion, and he absolutely gives zero fucks for advisors who ask him to filter what he writes. This makes for a wonderful tapestry of over-the-top and animated tweets from our new president. \nSo now imagine some famous folks throughout history and how they would sound if they Tweeted just as the Donald does. It’s pretty damn funny if you don’t take this too seriously – or politically.
