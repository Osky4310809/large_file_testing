Fellow right-hander Deolis Guerra has been designated for assignment in order to clear a spot on the 40-man roster. \nAdams, 30, has seen action in the past three seasons with Cleveland and was particularly sharp in 2015 when he pitched to a 3.78 ERA with 6.2 K/9, 3.5 BB/9 and a 46.8 percent ground-ball rate. His numbers took a step back across the board in 2016, though, as Adams allowed an unsightly 20 earned runs on 27 hits and seven walks with 17 strikeouts in 18 1/3 innings — a 9.82 ERA on the year. Overall, the former fifth-round pick has a career 6.29 ERA in 58 2/3 Major League innings. \nOn a more positive note, Adams has had plenty of success in Triple-A, where he’s spent parts of three seasons. In that time, he’s tossed 103 2/3 innings of relief, logging a 3.47 ERA with 9.5 K/9 against 2.8 BB/9. He’s also averaged better than 96 mph on his fastball in recent seasons. Adams will join an unsettled bullpen mix with the Halos, where Huston Street , Cam Bedrosian , J.C. Ramirez and Andrew Bailey seem like the only right-handers that have spots locked down at this time. \nThe 27-year-old Guerra had his first extended stint of success in the Majors in 2016, as he logged a 3.21 ERA with 6.1 K/9, 1.2 BB/9 and a 42.2 percent ground-ball rate in 53 1/3 innings with the Halos. Though he showed excellent control, Guerra averaged just over 90 mph on his fastball and didn’t miss many bats in 2016, neither of which helped his cause. His strike-throwing ability could certainly pique the interest of another club, but at this stage of the offseason, but teams have gravitated more and more toward power arms in their bullpens (as this trade/DFA demonstrates), which could allow the Halos to pass Guerra through waivers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:06:06.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
