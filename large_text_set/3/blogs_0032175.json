Koeman has been strongly linked with the Holland job (Photo: Jan Kruger) \nDepay said: \"We have fought for every meter. The game was better than against Bulgaria but it is a very bad week. \n\"There was a lot going on. The resignation of Danny Blind and fierce criticism we've received. \n\"We need to regroup - even in difficult times we must remain close together. Let's stay positive and try to keep the faith.\" poll loading Who should succeed Luis Enrique as Barcelona boss? 3000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:24:57.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
