In the atrium, a new custom-designed chandelier hangs overhead. \nAll cabins onboard were outfitted with new carpet, furniture, flat-screen TVs and headboards with bedside USB charging outlets. Villas, suites and cabins in The Haven , Norwegian's \"ship within a ship\" concept, have new finishes on walls and ceilings, as well as new draperies and flooring. The Haven also features four new cabanas. In all, the ship's staterooms display more than 2,250 pieces of upgraded artwork. \n\"We're thrilled to welcome Norwegian Jade back into the fleet with her new stylish finishes and modernized onboard atmosphere,\" said Andy Stuart, Norwegian Cruise Line president and CEO, in a statement. \nFor the next month, Norwegian Jade will offer its regular winter season itineraries to the Western Caribbean from Tampa. On April 30, the ship will relocate to Europe via a transatlantic voyage, spending its summer sailing to Norway from Southampton and Hamburg. \n--By Ashley Kosciolek, Editor Get expert advice, insider tips and more.
