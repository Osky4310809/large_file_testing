The change is causing some excitement among collectors. \n“Right below the date, you’ll see the letter P ,” said Rich Weaver, the president of the Delaware Valley Rare Coin Company. \nDepartment Of Treasury Unveils 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin \nWeaver says the P has never appeared on one-cent pieces struck in Philadelphia. “You’ve seen D before for Denver, S for San Francisco.
