I’m not sure everyone appreciates how many hours work our volunteers have put in. \n“It has been a huge task. As a club we only have three full time people.” (Photo: REUTERS) (Photo: PA) (Photo: PA) \nArsenal and boss Arsene Wenger will arrive under huge pressure after being thrashed 5-1 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League. \nElliott is daring to dream about heaping more misery on Sutton’s big-name visitors. \nHe joked: “What am I going to do on Tuesday? A holiday sounds quite an attractive proposition – but then we could be planning for the quarter final, couldn’t we?!! Or the replay. Read More When is the FA Cup quarter-final draw? Ball numbers and more ahead of the sixth round \n“We shall know the draw because it is on Sunday, which is quite frightening in itself - we will be in the draw for the quarter finals. \n“My dream draw? Old Trafford. I have always had a soft spot for Manchester United. But let’s not carried away! We can’t think about that. We have to keep our feet on the ground.” poll loading Will Sutton United beat Arsenal? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:26:06.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
