It doesn't look like the owner of this car will be back Credit: News Dog Media \nP hotos show 26 of the fines, which are reportedly for £100 each, posted in rows on the windscreen of the silver vehicle. \nAn employee at a vape shop located in the car park said it had been there for around six months, adding: “I've no idea whose it is … it doesn't look like they're coming back to get it.” \nBirmingham City Council said it was an issue for the owner of the car park. \nL ast year, a Mercedes left in another Birmingham city centre multi-storey car park for three years was finally removed after racking up more than £14,000 in parking tickets. \nAPCOA, the company who owned the car park, finally towed the Mercedes away after receiving permission from Birmingham City Council. \n\"We did not move the car initially because the city council has previously taken responsibility for removing vehicles and, unsurprisingly, we believed this was still the case,” an APCOA spokesperson said at the time. \n\"The car will probably be taken away for scrap. There are no plans to pursue the owner.\" Watch | Motorist uses bricks to level park car in unaccessible spot 01:09", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:13:17.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
