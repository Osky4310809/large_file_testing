The A Seat at the Table- inspired syllabus will tackle five themes, including Resisting Racism, Understanding Gender and Sexuality, The Role of Relationships, Nurturing Ourselves and “A Seat at the Lunch Table.” \n“Solange Knowles’s A Seat at the Table has been one of the most reflective and popular albums produced by a young black woman that speaks to issues of race, womanhood, and equality,” reads the Seatsyllabus website . \n“At the beginning of this new year, and as we witness the inauguration of a new president, we invite young women of color, ages 16-30, to have a seat at the table by helping us collect the texts, music, and visual art that speak to our experiences. If we are to have a democracy in which all of us have a seat at the table, we know that these experiences should be central to the development of America’s practices and policies,” the statement continues. \nAccording to Knowles’ site Saint Heron , writer Melissa Harris-Perry, Wake Forest students and scholars played an integral role in birthing the idea of the syllabus. \nIn October, Knowles scored her first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with A Seat at the Table . \nFor those interested in submitting material, admissions will be accepted until Jan. 31 .
