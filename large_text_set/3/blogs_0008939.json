By: FE Online | Published: March 11, 2017 4:23 PM BJP President Amit Shah today addressed a press conference in his trademark saffron waistcoat but refused to make any aggressive, or arrogant statements to rub his rivals noses in the dirt. (ANI) \nAfter implementing a master strategy during the Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and even Manipur assembly elections, with the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) set to ink a mammoth win in UP and Uttarakhand and probably in the other two states too, party President Amit Shah today addressed a press conference in his trademark saffron waistcoat but refused to make any aggressive, or arrogant statements to rub his rivals noses in the dirt. Instead, he played the role of a statesman to the hilt. After bowing his head in gratitude to the public for its massive support to make these wins possible as well as thanking prime Minister Narendra Modi for his support and providing direction to his strategy, Shah said that the victory was possible because of the BJP’s agenda of development. He was then asked about the general perception of BJP winning because of its hard saffron image, but Shah quickly dashed that line of questioning by saying “India has exited Muslim-Hindu divide. Move past Muslim-Hindu dichotomy, a voter is a voter; politics of development should take place.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T12:55:34.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
