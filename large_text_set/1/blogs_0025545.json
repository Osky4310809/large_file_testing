He’s (only) done about half a pre-season.” \nLyon pointed out Oliver’s debut game last year against the GWS Giants, which earned him the Round 1 Rising Star nomination. He won a game-high seven clearances, including five in a first half that Brownlow medallist Gerard Healy described as the best he’d seen from a debutant. Clayton Oliver won a Rising Star nomination in Round 1, 2016.
