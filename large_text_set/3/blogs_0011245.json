Your family would die for you, your friends would do anything to make you happy, your colleagues respect you and any person you meet can’t forget you, because you’re memorable and you’re smart and you’re warm. Let me remind you that I love you and let me tell you why and show you how. \nLet me remind you that you’re not alone. I’m with you and many people are, all you have to do is ask . You don’t have to face your fears alone, you don’t have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders alone and you don’t have to feel the need to have all the answers, because we all get lost and we all doubt ourselves and we’re all scared of the unknown, but let me remind you that we can get lost together or find our way together and maybe then, we’ll find some answers. \nLet me remind you that you’re talented. You have the passion and the drive to pursue your dreams, you have the ability to make it in the most competitive environments and you have what it takes to make people listen to you, to make them pay attention, to make them stop and watch you. Let me remind you that I’ll never get tired of watching you, even when you mess up, even when you’re struggling to find the right words, even when your clothes are not matching, even when you don’t have anything to say, I’ll still watch you and I’ll be your biggest fan. \nLet me remind you that you don’t have to be perfect, you don’t have to fit in every box, you don’t have to color inside the lines — it’s okay if you’re different, it’s okay if you’re misunderstood, it’s okay if not everyone likes you or even if they like you for a little while before they change their minds. Let me remind that I like you and I always will. I know sometimes you might not think that I’m enough, but I’m the only one who truly matters. \nBecause I am you, the side of you that you sometimes forget, the side of you that you sometimes hate, the side of you that you need when everyone else walks out on you and when you feel like giving up. \nI’m there and I will always be especially on the nights when you can’t sleep because you’re sad or heartbroken or frustrated with your life. I’ll be there, ready to remind you of all the things that you are and all the things that you can be .
