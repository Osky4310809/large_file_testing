(Flickr Photo / Alan48). The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation has awarded the University of Washington a $279 million grant, distributed over the next 10 years, to help researchers study the health of populations around the world.\nThe funds will support UW’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), furthering the work of the Population Health Initiative that launched in May. The grant is the largest private donation in the university’s history.\nThe donation will help IHME continue its work using data and analysis to address the world’s most drastic health concerns and it will fund new initiatives as well. IHME plans to use the 10-year grant to track how healthcare resources are used around the world and identify more effective ways to plan and set health-related priorities in different communities.\n“IHME provides critical data about global health trends that can empower policymakers worldwide to identify better solutions in the fight against disease,” Bill Gates said in a press release. \nThe Gates Foundation has been a big supporter of the IHME since it opened in 2007. In October, the non-profit juggernaut announced a $210 million donation to the UW’s Population Health Initiative, a 25-year effort to improve the health of populations around the globe by taking a broad approach to promoting wellness. Those funds will help UW build a public health hub, housing the IHME, Population Health Initiative, and portions of the School of Public Health.\nWith sustained support from the Gates Foundation, IHME has grown from three employees to 300 over the past nine years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T18:14:53.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
