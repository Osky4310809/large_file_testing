We don't yet know if it's a fully fledged game, if it's Japan-exclusive, if it's an upcoming Virtual Console title, or if it's even real.\nThis is massive for a number of reasons, most notably due to the fact that  Seiken Densetsu 3 has never been localized. Despite that it has a massive worldwide following and many fan translations, so even if it only arrives on the Japanese eShop, everyone could easily access it .\nWhatever the case might be, putting out obscure games like this would show more initiative toward retro preservation than most of the Virtual Console efforts on Wii U. I really hope this new iteration of the service is worthwhile.\nSeiken [Twitter]\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:08:37.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
