You've probably heard of the movie (and seen it), but did you know that much of the movie was shot in San Diego? Some locations are long gone, but others still exist and are revered by the legions of \"Top Gun\" fans. Here is a list of San Diego spots seen in the film, many of which can still be visited around town. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. Timm Ziegenthaler/Stocktrek Images/Getty Images 1. Miramar Air Station \nNow the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, the former Naval Air Station at Miramar was for years known as Fighter Town U.S.A. and the home of the Top Gun training school. The base is not readily accessible to the public, but if you're in the area along Mirarmar Road and I-15, you can see fighter jets doing maneuvers in the sky (but maybe not the F-14s from the movie). The volleyball scene in Top Gun was shot on sand courts on the base. No longer in existence, the courts were located north of barracks 298-300. Hangar three at VF-124 was used for many of the hangar scenes. \ncontinue reading below our video America's Best Foodie Cities 2. Kansas City Barbeque \nTop Gun might have been all about fighter jets and fly boys, but it was the scene where Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards (along with Kelly McGillis and Meg Ryan) bash out \"Great Balls of Fire\" on the piano that sticks in the mind of many viewers. This scene was filmed at the Kansas City Barbeque at 610 W. Market Street in the Gaslamp Quarter . The venerable rib joint became iconic in filmdom because of this scene, and is now a tourist attraction, even after a major fire. According to the owners, a location director was downtown, saw the place and stopped in for a beer. He liked the vibe, told director Tony Scott and Scott asked if they could close for a day of filming. And the rest is film history.

But the scene where Maverick and Charlie are sitting on the patio was actually filmed on the Paramount Studios lot. The house, in need of restoration, is in an area slated for redevelopment, where a resort complex is planned. Because of the house's popularity, the structure is planned to be incorporated into the developer's plans. More » 4. Naval Training Center (now Liberty Station) \nThe former Naval Training Center is now the mixed use development called Liberty Station, but in the Top Gun era, it was still the place where Naval recruits went through boot camp training. Many of the historic buildings along the NTC Promenade on Old Decatur Road are similar -- if not the same -- as some of the exterior scenes from the movie, including the scene where Charlie runs after Maverick to his motorcycle after a classroom briefing. There was also a memorable scene where Cruise follows McGillis into a bathroom at a bar -- this was filmed at NTC in the USO Building (no longer there). More » 5. West Laurel and Union Streets (Banker's Hill) \nThis is the location of the spot in the movie where Charlie (McGillis) chases down Maverick (Cruise) in her Porsche and confronts him. As you go up the hill, there is a big palm tree where the scene was filmed. More » 6. Windsock Bar & Grill \nIn the scene where Maverick is sitting at a bar drinking a glass of water, Charlie finds him and asks \"So, I am too late?\" There's a big picture window with planes on a runway in the background. That scene was shot at the Windsock Bar & Grill, which is located right on the runway of Lindbergh Field at the Jimsair Charter Service.
