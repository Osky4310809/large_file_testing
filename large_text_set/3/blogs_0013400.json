By Scott Mervis / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nBastard Bearded Irishmen didn’t play their annual post-St. Patrick’s Day Parade gig in Market Square last weekend — there was a cover band covering for them — but the Irish punks are back to do the regular rowdy night at the Rex on the South Side, on Friday. Bastard Bearded Irishmen \nWith: Shelf Life String Band, Krank Daddies. \nWhere: Rex Theater, South Side. \nWhen: 8 p.m. Friday. \nTickets: $12-$15; www.rextheater.com. \nBBI was otherwise occupied last Saturday, representing Pittsburgh at the Shamrock Festival in Roanoke, Va., on a bill with the Dropkick Murphys, Carbon Leaf, Street Dogs, House of Pain and Coolio, among others. \nAnd how was it? \n“It was cold,” says bassist Ben Jaber. “When we went on, it was about 35 degrees, and that was the warmest it was all day. Our set was early, but we still had a crowd of about 500 people. Played a fast set and the crowd was into it. Overall, the festival was fun. Tons of people still braved the cold, and that DC crowd was pumped.” \nOne of his favorite acts of the day was a fellow undercard — LA ska punk quartet The Interrupters. \n“So impressed by a four-piece ska band to sound so full. Polished,” he says. “I guess that’s what a few weeks in Europe with Green Day will do to you.” \nBBI did not have to worry about frozen fingers in February on the Sail Across the Sun Cruise from Tampa, Fla., to Costa Maya, Mexico, with Train, Matt Nathanson, Michael Franti & Spearhead, Natasha Bedingfield, Arrested Development and more. \n“The community of those ships is wild,” the bassist says. “You have about 2,500 people, from children to people in their 70s, who love music and just want to have a good time. I mean, everyone wants to party. And it’s strange because our sound doesn’t really fit in with that lineup, but the other bands have become friends, and the people go crazy because we’re the only band like that on the boat. So we closed out two nights and played late another night. Worked perfectly.” \nThey were also the house band for Boozical Chairs, a game of drunken musical chairs where they improvised their way through “La Bamba” and “The Chicken Dance Song”— better them than Train for that — and, Mr. Jaber says, “On our off day, we walked around the whole ship, like an Irish Mariachi band, playing for the crew, in the buffet, in several elevators, people’s cabins, the casino, the tattoo shop.” \nIt was the kind of trip that makes up for all those nights early on, back in 2009-10, when they played clubs for a handful of people. Just to keep it real, though, on the way back from Tampa, their van blew a spark plug at midnight, and they spent two days in a West Virginia motel. \n“It keeps us grounded,” the bassist says. \nMeanwhile, the Bastards’ third album is in the works at the Mr. Smalls studios, and they hope to finish it next month. \n“We’re hoping for a fall release,” Mr. Jaber says, “maybe around halfway to St. Patrick’s Day.” \nScott Mervis: smervis@post-gazette.com; 412-263-2576. \nMore St. Patrick’s Day weekend music \nTHURSDAY \n• Claddagh’s, SouthSide Works: Tullyvcavy (6-8 p.m.); www.claddaghirishpubs.com/pittsburgh. \n• Hotel Indigo, East Liberty: Abbots Cross (7 p.m.); 412-665-0555. \nFRIDAY \n• Claddagh’s, SouthSide Works: Tullycavy (noon-3:30 p.m.), David Backlands Marshall (4-5 p.m.), Abbots Cross (5:30-8:30 p.m.), Hooley (9 p.m.-midnight) and a house DJ (12:30 a.m.-close).
