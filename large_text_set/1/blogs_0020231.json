The company launched the Honor 5X ( review ) budget smartphone last year which besides a few quirks, offered promising features. Now, the company has launched the successor to the smartphone in the form of 6X ( review ), so we decided to compare the two to see what changes the new smartphone brings to the table and if it warrants an upgrade. Design and Display \nThe 6X, like the 5X, can be seen sporting a unibody metal design. Both the smartphones flaunt subtle curves on the back, giving them an ergonomic grip which also paves way for a comfortable one-handed experience. Suffice it to say, Honor has done a great job yet again to mask its budget-oriented 6X as a premium device. Both the smartphones can be seen sporting 5.5-inch full HD IPS displays too, which give them great viewing angles, thereby enriching the media consumption experience. Fingerprint sensors can also be found on the back of both the smartphones, below their respective camera modules. Honor has stuck to the ”if it ain’t broke” philosophy with the 6X, which does little to differentiate itself from its predecessor in terms of design and display. Regardless, the smartphone scores big in our books in both departments. Performance, Storage and Software \nHonor has done a 180 and taken a completely different route in terms of the processing package powering the 6X. While the 5X was powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor, the 6X derives its power from the brand’s in-house Kirin 655 SoC. While both the SoCs come with a mix of performance and battery efficient cores, the cores of the Kirin processor have been clocked much higher at 2.1GHz. Therefore, buyers will definitely find the Honor 6X to perform better than the 5X. For RAM, the Honor 6X gets upto a 100 percent increment and can be seen with either a 3GB unit or a 4GB unit instead of just the 2GB unit found on its predecessor. The 6X gets a bump in its onboard memory too, and now comes with either 32GB or 64GB of storage instead of just 16GB on the Honor 5X. Both the smartphones feature microSD card slots for expansion of storage up to 128GB.While the Honor 5X runs Android Lollipop upon boot, the Honor 6X ships with Android Marshmallow out of the box. Honor loads its smartphones with a custom skin (dubbed EMUI), much like every other Chinese smartphone vendor. Camera, Battery and Connectivity \nThe biggest change that the Honor 6X features from its predecessor is the presence of a dual-camera setup on its back. While the Honor 5X comes with a single 13MP primary sensor, the 6X features a pair of 12MP and 2MP sensors on the back making it a great option for photography nerds. The front facing camera of the device has also seen an upgrade, with the 6X now featuring an 8MP sensor instead of a 5MP shooter. Rest assured, users will find the 6X a much better pocket shooter than the 5X. The Honor 6X gets a boost in the battery department as well and is fuelled by a 3,340mAh battery. The Honor 5X on the other hand, draws its power from a 3,000mAh battery. Both the smartphones come with the standard connectivity options along with support for 4G LTE. So does the Honor 6X come as a worthy upgrade over the 5X? Absolutely. However, with the recent launch of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( review ) and the Coolpad Cool 1 Dual ( first impressions ), the smartphone does have some serious competition to face.
