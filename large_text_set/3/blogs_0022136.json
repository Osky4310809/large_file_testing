If it is passed, an extra 14 million Americans are predicted to be left without health care insurance next year. \nIndependent analysts have also predicted that five million fewer people will be covered by Medicaid by 2018, while Democratic senator Bernie Sanders simply stated that “thousands of Americans will die” if the legislation is passed. \nFor Mr Moss, the problem with the new health care plan is that it will end a policy under Obamacare in a majority of states that saw addiction services covered by Medicaid. \nAddiction is a tough subject for Mr Moss, who found his 24-year-old son dead in bed in 2014. He had died from a heroin overdose. \nMr Moss had believed addiction was an important topic for the president too. During his campaign, Mr Trump had called drug addiction a “tremendous problem” and, at a town hall meeting in Ohio last year, he told supporters: “It’s very hard to get out of the addiction of heroin. We’re going to work with them, we’re going to spend the money, we’re going to get that habit broken,” Business Insider reported. Bernie Sanders grills Tom Price on Trump's health care plans \nMr Trump even addressed his troubadour directly at one rally. Pointing at Mr Moss and addressing the death of the singer’s son, Mr Trump said: “And I know what you went through. He’s a great father, I can see it. And your son is proud of you. Your son is proud of you,” CNN reported. Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:23:34.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
