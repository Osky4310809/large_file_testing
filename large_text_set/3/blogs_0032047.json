And in the process, the Chaebol has ignited the battle for the throne of the best premium flagship smartphone of 2017. Although the smartphone duo come packed with the latest cutting edge innovations, they face stiff competition not only from LG G6 but also from the yet to be announced 10th-gen Apple iPhone, which is rumoured to bring revolutionary features to the table. Join us, as we pit the latest and greatest from the Korean giants in a three-way battle. Design In terms of their physical attributes, the Samsung Galaxy S8+ is the thickest of the lot at 8.1mm girth whereas the LG G6 ( first impressions ) is the sleekest at 7.9mm, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 settling for a spot in between. The Galaxy S8 is also the lightest of the trio at 151g. Build-wise, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are reminiscent of its predecessors – the Galaxy S7 / Galaxy S7 edge ( review ) – for the devices come encased in a glass-metal build which impart a glossy finish to the smartphones. Samsung has chosen to move the fingerprint sensor to the rear as well and it now sits right next to the camera module, which might take some time to get used to. While an iris scanner resides on the front bezel, there’s no trademark physical home button on the fascia, as the company has employed a pressure sensitive display for interaction instead. Moreover, a dedicated button to invoke Samsung’s virtual assistant Bixby has also been added. LG too follows a similar design language with a combination of a metal frame and glass back which lends the LG G6 a premium appeal. The design ethos is minimalistic with the portion above the screen occupied by an earpiece, front-facing snapper and a few sensors. The smartphone banks on software based navigation keys thereby allowing the LG logo to shimmer on the bezel below the display. The rear of the LG G6 has dual camera sensors on either side of a two-tone LED flash. You’ll find the power button that also doubles up as a fingerprint scanner, but thankfully, with a more natural placement below the camera module. The smartphones are susceptible to smudges on the glass back, which has been strengthened by a coating of Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on each. The devices also retain the 3.5mm headphone jack and include a USB Type C port for fast and hassle free connectivity. Needless to say, both the manufacturers have delivered head-turners in slim profiles which really draw the line between the fast diminishing gap between premium flagships and budget powerhouses. The LG G6 will be available in three colours: Mystic White, Astro Black and Ice Platinum, and Samsung offers its flagships in shades of Orchid gray, Midnight Black, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue and Maple Gold. Display All the three devices sport a Quad-HD+ resolution “always-on” display with differences in the screen size and the underlying technology used. While the Samsung devices flaunt the usual Super AMOLED displays, sized 5.8-inches for the S8 and 6.2-inches for the S8+, the LG G6 offers a 5.7-inch IPS LCD FullVision display, making the S8 the sharpest device in terms of the pixel density count (570ppi).Xiaomi kick-started the trend of bezel-less displays with the Mi Mix but its the Korean giants who have dared to globally release flagships with such screens on-board. \nDubbed the Infinity display, the current iteration of the Galaxy S series flagships come with dual-curved screens with a wide aspect ratio of 18.5:9, which is similar to LG’s approach with the G6, which offers a slightly more definite 18:9 or 2:1 aspect ration. The display is seamless along the edges and is also the first to get Mobile HDR Premium certification from UHD alliance. Although some might consider the display to be too big to be used with one hand, the S8+’s impressive screen-to-body ratio has allowed Samsung to cram in a lot more screen real estate. \nThe LG G6 flaunts a gorgeous FullVision display as well and is being touted as the world’s first smartphone to offer support for Dolby Vision HDR standard. The new 18:9 aspect ratio is to thank for the bump in real estate which also allows the phone to sport extremely narrow bezels, which results in a stunning screen-to-body ratio of about 90 percent. While there are no clear winners in this department, we prefer the S8 duo for the added curved-display features and for the fact that the panels are secured by the latest variant of Corning Gorilla Glass. Performance and storage Continuing with its dual processor approach with the Galaxy S8 and S8+, the company will sell the Galaxy S8 duo with the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC in the international market whereas select regions – including India – will get S8 siblings equipped with the octa-core Exynos 8895 chipset. The new 10nm processors are coupled with 4GB of RAM (select markets might receive variants with 6GB of RAM as well) and bring 10 percent more power to the CPU and 21 percent more to the Adreno 540 GPU on-board, giving them a considerable edge over the LG G6 which is powered by the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC and Adreno 530 GPU. The new chipset also makes the Samsung devices the first in the world to feature support for 1 gigabit LTE. It is a closely contested encounter between the Exynos 8895 and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC variants and we reserve our final verdict to our in-depth reviews, although there should not be any major difference between the day-to-day usage performance of either of the devices. As for the internal storage, the duo ship with 64GB (select markets might receive 128GB variants) of memory with a slot for storage expansion via microSD cards. The LG G6 offers two storage variants: 32GB and 64GB, and also supports microSD cards for expanding the storage but theoretically, the LG G6 can support cards up to 2TB capacity, whereas Samsung sets a more realistic 256GB upper limit. Cameras The predecessors to these flagships offered stunning picture quality and it should prove to be a neck-to-neck competition this year as well for both manufacturers have opted to improve on the new camera technologies they adopted last year. The Galaxy S8 siblings come with a few minor tweaks in the camera department and can be seen with the same 12MP f/1.7 sensor rear shooter which is been powered by dual-pixel technology. The camera also comes with multi-frame processing to ensure that the perfect shot isn’t missed. Up front, the smartphone gets an 8MP selfie shooter with autofocus functionality. LG challenged the conventional smartphone camera setups with dual rear cameras with the LG G5 ( review ) last year. This time around, the flagship offering features two 13-megapixel cameras on the back with a dual LED flash, HDR 10, OIS, 4K video recording, 360-degree panorama, square camera grid shots and 125-degree angle of view. For selfies, the LG G6 offers a 5MP sensor. Battery In the battery department, the Galaxy S8+ has the highest battery capacity of the lot with its 3,500mAh battery, followed by the LG G6 with a 3,300mAh battery and the Galaxy S8 with a smaller 3,000mAh battery. We think Samsung has decided not to cram the device with extra juice so as to be cautious this time around, post the Note7 incident. All the batteries are non-removable in nature but support fast charging as well as wireless charging. Software and Connectivity All smartphones run Android 7.1 Nougat, with Samsung’s duo getting an overlay of the custom TouchWiz UI, which has been further streamlined in order to minimize resource consumption. The LG G6 has the LG UX 6.0 overlaying the stock experience. Both the skins should offer similar functionality in most aspects. The LG G6 comes pre-loaded with the Google Assistant, making it the second phone after the Google Pixel to do so. However, Samsung has debuted its new virtual assistant – dubbed Bixby – that is expected to be the common connection between its range of smart devices in the future. With its smart assistant Bixby , Samsung wants consumers to be able to use their handsets in a more efficient manner. What’s more interesting is the fact that Bixby works with Google’s AI Assistant, instead of competing with it. It’ll be a contextual assistant that’s smart enough to understand your intentions, and thus reduces needless touches and swipes. Bixby also has a Vision component that provides you with information when you point your camera to any object.Both the manufacturers have loaded their flagships up to the brim with the latest connectivity options including support for 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC, GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS and BDS amongst others. However, thanks to the new Dual-Audio feature, the Galaxy S8 duo can also connect to two Bluetooth headphones simultaneously. Additional features and accessories Samsung has also introduced a few handy accessories to go along with the latest flagships. One of these is the Samsung Desktop Experience (DeX), which delivers a desktop-like experience for the Galaxy S8 duo. It allows users to use their Galaxy S8 series devices like a computer (much like Microsoft Continuum) by connecting it to an external display, such as a TV monitor, via the DeX Station. The dock offers an HDMI connection at 4K resolution at 30fps, two USB 2.0 ports, an Ethernet port, an embedded cooling fan and a USB Type-C port for your phone. DeX also offers access to suites such as Office and Autodesk through the virtual desktop service. Apart from this, Samsung has also released a wide variety of phone covers for the duo out of which the LED view, external keyboard and clear view standing covers are notable. The trio of devices is impervious to water and dust thanks to the IP68 rating. The LG G6 offers more rigidity in the form of MIL-STD-810G tested shock resistance. It also promises superior sound with an upgraded 32-bit quad-DAC, which was being offered as a separate module attachment last year. Pricing, availability and offers The key factor that might make or break the sales of these smartphones is the pricing and while Samsung has announced the same, we still await these details to be released by LG. It’d be safe to assume that the LG G6 will be priced upwards of Rs 45,000 in India, possibly around Rs 49,990 according to some reports, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ would retail for about Rs 57,000 and Rs 64,000 respectively, but without the official statement from the companies, this should be taken with a pinch of salt. The new Samsung smartphones go on pre-order starting March 30th and will retail in the US from April 21st. Users who pre-order them will get a Gear VR (2017) and a controller, while a limited-edition bundle of $99 would offer AKG Bluetooth headphones along with earphones. LG is yet to unveil the details regarding the G6’s availability in India and there seem to be no special pre-order offers for unlocked LG G6 devices at the moment either. \nFor convenience, we have summarised all the specifications in a comparison format below. In conclusion, these premium flagships have surely improved over their predecessors but at the same time make it a very tough decision to choose between the three by just looking at the bare specifications. The Samsung S8 and S8+ plus offer gorgeous displays encased in a gorgeous shell, and unmatched performance and connectivity options that might give all the other smartphones a run for their money this year. However, the LG G6 should emerge as the more affordable option with great cameras, battery life and better button placement.
