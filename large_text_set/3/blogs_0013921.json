Stacey Kirk \nMaggie Wilkinson tells MPs in Parliament's Social Services Committee of her fight to be reunited with her daughter Vivienne Cory-Wrigh (left), after the Anglican Church - sanctioned by the state at the time - took her at birth and adopted her out. Wilkinson was also supported by her younger daughter Rebecca Wilkinson (right). \nShe and 100 other people who signed the petition also asked that the inquiry \"include and acknowledge the abuse, pain, and suffering caused by the state-sanctioned practice of forced adoption\". \nREAD: * From illegitimacy to understanding \nWilkinson shared her story with the MPs. \nIn an era when women were not yet allowed to seek contraception without first showing the doctor a wedding ring, a 19-year-old Wilkinson received a phone call from her beau. \nHe asked her to return home to him - which she did, and promptly got pregnant. \nWhen he was summoned to hear the news - and, she hoped, to offer marriage - instead he asked her if she was sure the child was his. \nShe was sent to St Mary's home for unwed mothers, in Otahuhu, Auckland. Ad Feedback \nThere, she told MPs, she was left bleeding \"physically and mentally, after her daughter was taken from her at birth. \n\"I no longer existed as my child's mother. Then in a flawed act of supreme judgmental, smiling sentimentality, the abductors handed my child to those they deemed more entitled to parenthood, ignoring the reality of my family, my whanau, our history and biological heritage,\" she said. \n\"My hand on the bible, promising never to find my precious child. No support, no advocacy, my womb emptied of the wanted product - the state sanctified abduction deemed successful.\" \nHer fight to find out what happened was met with roadblocks in the years following. Attempts to gain access to her records held by the Anglican Church of New Zealand - which carried out the adoption - were mostly unsuccessful. \nShe was told one set of records were destroyed in floods, while another set was lost in a fire. \nWilkinson sat in Parliament's select committee room three on Wednesday, flanked by her two daughters Vivienne Cory-Wright and Rebecca Wilkinson. \nWilkinson was reunited with her first-born daughter Cory-Wright in 1980, when the then-17-year-old tracked her mother down. \n\"Losing my daughter to abduction impacted on all of our family - our children who had not been born, when the abduction occurred, it impacted on the man I married because I never got over it. \n\"The depression I suffered impacted on them all with devastating results.\" \nWilkinson had made attempts to commit suicide in the past, and told MPs she was also petitioning them on behalf of many women she knew who had successfully taken their lives. \nHer incident was not a single event. \"It was a nationwide, state-sanctioned, baby-scoop\". \nFellow petitioner Christine Hamilton - who told MPs of her own story of losing a child - estimated thousands of women were involved. \nThe practice - carried out by the Anglican Church - occurred all over the world, and was most famously depicted in the Oscar-nominated film Philomena starring Dame Judi Dench. \nIn 2013, in Australia, former Prime Minister Julia Gillard delivered a historic national apology in Parliament to the thousands of unwed mothers who were forced by government policies to give up their babies for adoption over several decades. \nWilkinson said an apology was not her main aim - \"an apology requested, is not an apology\" - but she wanted the results of an inquiry to be made a matter of public record, so the era was documented. \nThe Anglican Church in New Zealand has offered to open its books for any inquiry that might be held, but Justice Minister Amy Adams said no Government inquiry into past adoption practices was planned. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:07:52.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
