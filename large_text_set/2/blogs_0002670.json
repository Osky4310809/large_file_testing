It can mean a lot of things. It can mean, “I think that was a good tweet” or “Yes, I agree.” It can be used to bookmark a tweet you want to go back to later. \nOr, to hear Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain tell it, it can simply be the result of an accidental tap. \nOxlade-Chamberlain has publicly backpedaled after fans noticed he “liked” a tweet calling for manager Arsene Wenger to be sacked after Arsenal’s loss to Chelsea on Saturday. \nThe disputed “liked” tweet came shortly after Chelsea easily beat Arsenal, 3-1, which of course led to unhappy calling for Wenger to be dismissed on social media. Oxlade-Chamberlain seemed to endorse a message saying “WENGER NEEDS TO GO!!!” from a fan account called Arsenal Fan TV via the “like” button. Oxlade-Chamberlain's recent like 😳😳 pic.twitter.com/BfEY8akEaN \nFans quickly spotted it and the Arsenal midfielder, who started at Stamford Bridge in Saturday’s loss, retracted the “like” and publicly announced that it was merely an accident. I didn't mean to like that post earlier obviously… Didn't even realise I had! \n— Alex Ox-Chamberlain (@Alex_OxChambo) February 4, 2017 \nSome fans are taking him at his word, while others – either due to wishful thinking or genuine skepticism – aren’t. Either way, Saturday wasn’t a great day for the Gunners and Wenger, as they now sit 12 points behind the league-leading Chelsea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:26:49.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
