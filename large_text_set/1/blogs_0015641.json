Subsequently, Betts earned All-Australian selection in the past two consecutive seasons. \nBetts said he was delighted to re-sign with the club, which he believes is heading in an exciting direction. \n“The club is in great shape and we have such a positive environment where everyone works really hard but also knows how to make it enjoyable as well,” Betts said. \n“Playing finals footy is what it is all about and after experiencing that the last couple of years I know this playing group is capable of much more. \n“Everyone at the club has been really good to me and I love our fans too. They have made my family and I feel so welcome from the first day I arrived.” \nBetts has been just as influential off the field — particularly in the indigenous community — by mentoring young Crows players and helping out a few charities, including the Crows Children’s Foundation. \nAdelaide list manager Justin Reid said Betts’ brilliance on the field was matched by his humility off it. \n“Everyone knows that Eddie is a special talent but he also understands and contributes to our team-first approach and culture,” Reid said. \n“His durability is testament to the way he trains and prepares, and he has a clear picture of where we are heading and wants to continue on the journey.” \nMore to come ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:35:03.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
