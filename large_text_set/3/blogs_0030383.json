Screenshots Works well, but two issues by Pjroses This was very helpful at finding duplicate photos, and if I set the slider to a less exact match, it found similar ones. However, there were two issues: First, the instructions of how to delete the duplicates didn't work - simply hitting the delete key appeared to make them go away, but didn't really. (I checked this by going to About This Mac and hitting Storage, and noting the space devoted to photos, which did not go down). I've since read various suggestions on how to really make them go away - right click (on what?), select a marked duplicate photo then Get Info, which brings up a menu including delete (this was on the see detailed instructions online link, on one of the last pages of the app), (command/delete), looking for the \"recently\" deleted \"album\" on Photos and deleting its contents, and, after deleting, restarting the Mac. Second issue, when I was having trouble clearing up the space from the (supposedly) deleted photos, I called the help number listed on the app. The support rep wanted to connect to my computer and show me how to do it. Uh no way! I don't know anything about this company and I am not going to let someone connect to my computer and do who-knows-what, no matter how much he reassures me that they are a reputable company etc etc etc. No thanks, just give me some decent instructions and I'll do it myself. Good at finding duplicates. Could be better at culling them. by neliason This app is very good at finding duplicates or similar photographs. It allows you to adjust the match criteria giving you pretty good flexibility. It displays all the relevant information about a photograph such as capture date, location, camera in a sidebar. It has a very intuitive checkbox interface to allow you to choose which photos to delete. So for a basic duplicate finder it does the job.Where it falls short is in what it could do. The first suggestion is to change the UI to allow you to see the photograph in a larger size. While it does find duplicates the UI doesn’t provide an easy way to really compare the two photos. When I have very similar photos where I only want to keep the best photo the UI is of no help. It just shows a thumbnail. The UI should provide some easy way to see larger version of a duplicate photo group. It should allow you to toggle back and forth between the two. It would be really great if they added a mode where you could go through the groups of duplicates and chose which to delete in this larger view mode.The second suggestion would be not just display the coordinates of the photo but show the point on a map. This is rather trivial compared to the other issue but I think would be easy to do and more useful information is never a bad thing. A note on deleting the duplicated pictures by Pocowok This software provides the user the ability to find and matching the “similar” pictures under the user pre-defined rules. It then groups the similar pictures for you to mark for deletion. You can use the build-in auto marking based on a set of preference to mark the pictures. From there, the sofware will creates a “Duplicate Marked Photos\" album within the Photos app. To complete the deletion process, you can open the Duplicate Marked Photos album and select the pictures you don’t want. NOW, here is the step that may potentially cause some of complaints: To delete the pictures inside the album, one must NOT use the “delete” key on your keyboard. This will not work! You must use the right click on the selected photos to bring out the control icon as depicted in the Duplicate Photo Fixer Pro. For this small subtle difference, I wasted few hours of trying before realize the problem. I hope this would help to clearafy some of the one star reviews. On the other hand, the delete key works when you perform the delete function on all the other albums. It should be a simple fix on the part of developer to include both ways of deleting the pictures…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:10:11.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
