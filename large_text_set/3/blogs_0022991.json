Photo: Courtesy Of Stacy Davis Trial in Dominican Republic for Woodlands man delayed again 1 / 5 Back to Gallery \nA businessman from The Woodlands saw his trial once again postponed in the Dominican Republic, his lawyer said Wednesday. \nLarry Davis, 44, faces drug trafficking charges after he leased his family business' boat to a Honduran fuel trader who Dominican prosecutors say used the boat to smuggle nearly 1,000 kilograms of cocaine. \nThe trial initially was set for March 7, but his defense lawyers arrived to the Dominican court only to find the start date was delayed to March 22. Then, on March 22, officials said the trial was postponed once again, this time by more than a month. The latest start date is April 25. \nSean Buckley, the U.S. defense attorney coordinating Davis' defense, told the Chronicle in an email that Davis was \"devastated\" by the last-minute delay, which means he will return once again to a Dominican jail, where Buckley says safe drinking water is limited and at least one inmate died from a cholera outbreak. \nREAD MORE: Larry Davis' wife prays Dominican Republic 'nightmare' will end with quick exoneration \nBuckley said court officials attribute the delay to \"an error or oversight whereby some of the co-defendants and their lawyers were not present.\" He added that U.S. consular officials said this kind of delay is typical in the Dominican legal system. \nDavis' lawyers and family say he is innocent and had no idea the fuel trader, a member of a prominent Honduran business family, would use the boat for smuggling.
