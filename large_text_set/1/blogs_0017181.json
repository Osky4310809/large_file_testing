Megan Peters Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of \nMarvel fans, you should start bracing yourself now for what Avengers: Infinity War has in store for you. The much-anticipated blockbuster is set to bring together the biggest heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. From the Avengers to Doctor Strange, these superheroes will be pitted against Thanos as the Mad Titan makes his bid for the Earth. And, now, it looks like another star might have just tipped off her involvement with the movie. UP NEXT: Avengers: Infinity War Actors Claim They Still Haven't Seen The Script Yet \nOver on Instagram, Pom Klementieff posted a rather interesting photo that has the Internet buzzing. The actress, who will make her Marvel debut in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , shared a picture of The Avengers #123 comic cover. Since the actress is playing Mantis , the artwork shows the alien heroine as she’s bombarded by heroes like Vision, Iron Man, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and even Black Panther. \nThe actress simply posted the picture with a green heart emoji, but there’s another piece to this puzzle that has fans frantic. Not only is is odd for Klementieff to post a picture of a Mantis-heavy Avengers comic, but she also tagged the photo with a location. And, of course, the geo-tag is sourced to Atlanta, GA. \nFor those of you who don’t know. Avengers: Infinity War will begin filming on Monday in Atlanta. Not long ago, Collider’s Editor-In-Chief confirmed the schedule and said both Infinity War films would be shooting on January 23rd. \nOf course, Klementieff would not be the only star from the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise to appear in the blockbuster. Zoe Saldana has said Gamora will appear in the film, and Vin Diesel said the whole crew would appear in the film. Earlier today, Dave Bautista even tweeted that he begins filming tomorrow for Avengers: Infinity War despite not having seen a script. The timing of Bautista’s note is particularly interesting given Klementieff and her Instagram post; If the actress is part of the movie, she may be sharing some scenes with Drax the Destroyer since Bautista is already on set. \nAside from the MCU’s extraterrestrial characters, fans know that a slew of other actors will be involved with the film. Tom Holland recently confirmed he will have a part in the film, and Peter Dinklage is reportedly set to join the blockbuster. So far, there is no word on who the Game of Thrones star may be playing, but fans are betting the talent star plays MODOK given a recent haircut of his.  A photo posted by Pomin8r (@pomin8r) on Jan 22, 2017 at 5:50pm PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T06:20:01.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
