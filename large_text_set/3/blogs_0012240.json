(Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images) \nOffice of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said on a call with reporters Wednesday that the “America First budget” fulfills key promises the president made on the campaign trail. \n“In fact, we wrote it in the president’s own words,” Mulvaney said. “We went through his speeches, his comments, we talked to him and we wanted to know what his policies were, and we turned those policies into numbers.” \nMulvaney said the budget, which will be submitted to Congress Thursday, uses reductions in specific agencies to justify increases in others.

You’ll see reductions in the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, and in many agencies, as he tries to shrink the role of the federal government.” \n“If he said it on the campaign trail, it’s in the budget.” Mulvaney at a press briefing. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images) \nMulvaney warned there is a “fairly dramatic reduction in State Department” spending. He estimated 28 percent, but could not recall the exact number. Earlier reports suggested State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development budgets would be cut by 37 percent. \n“That is not a commentary on policy,” Mulvaney said. “It’s a commentary on what’s in their budget. We believe we have protected the diplomatic function of State and this is not a reflection of his policies towards State.” \nMulvaney said the proposed budget boosts Pentagon spending by 10 percent and Department of Homeland Security funding by six percent.

We have given [department heads] a tremendous amount of flexibility within their agencies. The actual budget blueprint will hit the highlights. You will not see a spreadsheet that goes line by line through the budget.” \nMulvaney said the budget revolves around the president’s policies —“defense, border enforcement and money for the wall.” \n“This is a budget blueprint,” he warned. “Not a complete budget. You will not see revenue projections or policy statements or mandatory spending. This is discretionary budget only.” \nMulvaney is scheduled to appear with press secretary Sean Spicer at the daily briefing Thursday afternoon at 2 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T06:18:07.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
