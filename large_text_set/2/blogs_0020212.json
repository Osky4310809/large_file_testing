Above we get our first look at some of the key members of the cast.\nThe new Star Wars picture centers around adventures before the events of Star Wars: A New Hope , including early encounters with the other card-playing rogue from a galaxy far, far away, Lando Calrissian.\nThe cast includes Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo, Woody Harrelson , Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian , Thandie Newton, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca, as direction comes from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.\n“Watching such inspired people from all over the world, with such unique voices, come together for the sole purpose of making art, is nothing short of miraculous,” Lord and Miller said. “We can’t think of anything funny to say, because we just feel really moved, and really lucky.”\nThe yet-to-be-titled Han Solo Star Wars film is scheduled to arrive on May 25 of next year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:15:38.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
