Now, they point to recent efforts to confront Republican legislators over attempts to repeal Mr Obama's healthcare reform as signs of life in a dispirited party. \nDemocrats face a tough challenge in the days ahead. They have to settle on a leader for their national committee - resolving an ideological battle between left-wing populists and those who preach continued Obama-style moderation and incrementalism. Media caption Trump inauguration: Children who support the president \nThey need to devise a strategy to win back Congress, complicated by the fact they have to defend 10 Senate seats in states that Donald Trump won in the upcoming 2018 mid-term congressional elections. And, before too long, candidates for the 2020 presidential nomination will begin jockeying for position. \nMore than anything else, however, they need to begin rebuilding their party on the local and state level. Mr Obama's successes glossed over a party that is bereft of young leaders working their way up through the ranks. \nAt the moment, the Democratic Party is a skeleton of its former self. Until they put some meat on its bones, memories of the 2008 hope that Obama ushered in - that they were a party of destiny - will seem to liberals like a cruel joke.
