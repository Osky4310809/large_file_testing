Its share price rose 1.4 percent after the announcement. \n\"Today we have signed a memorandum of understanding between the two companies and we will set up a ... project for the assembly and sales of both passenger and commercial vehicles,\" Nishat Mills company secretary Khalid Chauhan said. \nNishat Mills filed a statement with the Pakistan Stock Exchange saying the deal was \"subject to applicable statutory and regulatory approvals\". \nLast year, French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) agreed to invest in a new factory in Pakistan and South Korean carmaker Kia Motor Co (000270.KS) said it would start assembling cars in a joint venture with Karachi-listed Lucky Cement (LUKC.KA), part of the vast conglomerate Yunus Brothers Group. \nThe government believes increased competition should bring down exceptionally high car prices in Pakistan, and in March it introduced a new auto policy favoring new entrants into the market by offering generous import duties. \nThe incentives have angered existing market players, some of whom have said publicly they should get similar terms. \nPakistan, with a population of nearly 200 million people, is a potentially huge market, but just 180,000 cars were sold in the 2014/2015 fiscal year. That compares with more than 2 million passenger vehicles a year in neighboring India. 0 0 Hyundai to set up car assembly plant in Pakistan was posted in business   Business, Business News, Geo News, Latest Business News, Hyundai, Pakistan.   \"Hyundai to set up car assembly plant in Pakistan\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/129845-Hyundai-to-set-up-car-assembly-plant-in-Pakistan .
