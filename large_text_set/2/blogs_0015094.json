And the winner. \n“It was unbelievable. It was such a tough battle,” Phillips told Fox Footy after the match. \n“Full credit to Carlton, they were just so hard at it and put the pressure on.” Jubilation from the Crows after the final siren.

Last week against the Western Bulldogs, Bec Goddard’s girls only handballed 36 times. \nBut they were forced to go via hand 53 times against Carlton, limiting their trademark run and carry. \nWith their marquee Kellie Gibson taking no part in the match after injuring her right ankle in the first 30 seconds of the first quarter, Adelaide’s forward structure struggled. \nBut through Sarah ‘Tex’ Perkins and Phillips, they were able to get on top in the second half, particularly when Carlton’s Brianna Davey was benched through her own injury. \n“We had a great preseason. We put full trust in our fitness,” Phillips said. \n“We know we’re the best the end of the game. We knew our leg speed and our endurance was going to kick in.” \nPerkins was particularly instrumental in the second and third terms, when Carlton was firmly in control of the match. \nIn the dying minutes of the second quarter, she laid a bone crushing tackle on Lauren Attard — a physical demonstration that she meant business. \nWhen the second half resumed, it was Perkins’ second, third and fourth efforts that trapped the ball in the Crows’ forward 50. \nShe didn’t get credit on the scoreboard, but Perkins was game turning. \n“I’m very proud of the girls today,’ Perkins told Fox Footy . \n”We had to work really hard for it. It was an amazing game of football. \n“They’ve got a very strong backline. I found it tough personally. It was hard to breakaway and play our game of footy, but we got there in the end.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
