Though this was a giant long-awaited victory for animal rights , the fight for circus animals is far from over. Circuses from all around the world continue to abuse and exploit innocent animals for profit. \nSadly, the inhumane practices of the Indonesian circus depicted in the above video is not an isolated case. Circus animals are often beaten into submission and forced to perform unnatural “tricks” for audiences. The quality of life for circus animals is nothing like the fairy tales circuses try to depict. \nIn this Indonesian circus, dolphins are forced to stay out of the water for extended lengths of time for tricks and tourist photographs. Beaching for long periods of time can be extremely dangerous for dolphins as it puts pressure on their internal organs. The suffering does not end with the performance, however. Once they are done with performances, they are then hauled onto trucks and shipped on airplanes while OUT OF WATER. This needs to end now! \nIf you would like to learn more about how you can help stop these circuses and the airlines who ship circus animals, please visit Animal Asia’s website . Also, please remember to share the word and boycott all circuses and the airlines who work with them! Want to read more posts like this?
