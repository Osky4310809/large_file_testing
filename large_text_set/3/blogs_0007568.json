This time around, the streetwear label is focusing on their TYPE-1 and TYPE-3 models, with new versions of black, silver and gold available. As always with the TYPE-1 and TYPE-3, the release sees them donning a look similar to the Rolex Submariner and Daytona models, giving them a dressed-up look.\nThe watches are set to be released on March 11, where you can cop at your local BAPE store or BAPE’s official site. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:02:36.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
