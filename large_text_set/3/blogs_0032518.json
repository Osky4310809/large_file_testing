We’re happy to say that many of these incredible women will be honored at the 2017 Gracie Awards, including America Ferrera , Samantha Bee, Savannah Guthrie, Drew Barrymore, and Mariska Hargitay, since each of them has made significant contributions to media that have a positive influence on women everywhere .\nThe Alliance for Women in Media Foundation (AWMF) is hosting the Gracie Awards on June 6 at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. The goal of the Gracie Awards is to celebrate “female luminaries by recognizing their outstanding achievements across new and traditional media platforms.” We couldn’t think of a better word than “luminaries” to describe powerful women like Ferrera and Barrymore.\nBen Gabbe/Getty Images Sarah Foss, AWMF chair, made an announcement about the event, noting that the Gracie Awards are meant to honor women in media, but also to “take pause and recognize the millions of women who are not able to use their voice and creativity to share their message with the world.” To all those women out there Foss said: “We hear you. We are you. And we stand beside you.”\n“If we learned one thing this year, it is that the strength, courage and contributions of women are crucial and necessary components in moving the world forward,” Foss said. Hear, hear! Ferrera was recently honored for her humanitarian work at the Human Rights Campaign’s Los Angeles Dinner, where she was given the ally for equality award, presented by friend and fellow feminist activist Lena Dunham .\nChristopher Polk/Getty Images There’s no doubt Ferrera, Barrymore, and all the other women listed above deserve to be recognized at the Gracie Awards. Because without them, our world would be lacking some fierce women’s rights warriors.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:12:54.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
