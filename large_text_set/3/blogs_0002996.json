The FC crew acknowledge Luis Enrique's strong record at Barca, but question if he is among the top managers in the world. \nReading the Barcelona press in the days after Luis Enrique announced he would leave the club at the end of the season, it would not be unreasonable to think that the coach divides opinion in Catalonia, in spite of the glut of trophies he has won in under three years in charge -- La Liga (2), Copa del Rey (2), Champions League, Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup (all 1). \nBut listening to a bouncing Camp Nou roar the coach's name during the 5-0 win against Celta Vigo, the first game since the announcement, painted a very different picture as loud chants of \"Luis Enrique we love you, please don't leave,\" echoed around the 99,354 capacity stadium \nThe coach has not always enjoyed unanimous support in the plebiscite of the Camp Nou, though. Just two weeks earlier, loud whistles and boos were heard when the most vocal section of the stadium chanted his name as the team struggled to a 2-1 win over Leganes, just days after the 4-0 thrashing by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. \nSo what exactly will Luis Enrique's legacy be when he leaves the club after three trophy-laden seasons in the summer? \n\"Luis Enrique is one of the best coaches Barca has ever had,\" Carles Ordiales, president of fans group Seguiment, tells ESPN FC. \"He's won eight out of 10 trophies, but it's not just what he has won, fans also love his character and his identification with the club.\" Seguiment is the umbrella group which created the Grada de Animacion , a singing section in the Gol Nord end of the Camp Nou which has transformed the atmosphere inside the stadium since its creation at the start of this season. \n\"Since he arrived he has had a great relationship with the fans because they are very grateful for what he did as a player. He formed a bond with us and has always supported the Grada de Animacion . He salutes the supporters after each game and has praised us publically, so we're indebted to him, and it's a real shame he's leaving,\" adds Ordiales. \n\"It's true that during the Leganes game a section of the crowd showed their disapproval, but that's because they people are very demanding fans and it was their way of criticising the performance against PSG. It was just a criticism of that game and wasn't a protest against Luis Enrique in general, just look at the reaction of the entire stadium against Celta, everyone was chanting his name.\" \nThe discrepancy between the backing Luis Enrique gets from supporters and the lukewarm reception he receives in the media is easy to explain, according to Helena Condis, who covers Barca for radio station Cadena COPE. \"He doesn't have the same respect among the press as with the fans because he's always shown hostility towards us [the press], he hasn't built any relationships and he's been distant, so in difficult moments he hasn't received much backing in the media,\" she says. \nThere has also been plenty of discussion about Luis Enrique's relationship with the Barca players, which is reported to be distant. His lack of understanding with Lionel Messi came to the fore just a few months into his reign when he left the talismanic Argentine out of the starting line-up in a 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad in January 2015. \n\"He started out trying to impose his personality on the dressing room, stating he was the leader and the boss, without realizing Messi was used to eating at his own table, so to speak,\" adds Condis. \"After Anoeta [Real Sociedad's home ground] there was a crisis at the club and his relationship with the dressing room heavyweights was fraught. But after that he realised he had to retreat a little and give more freedom to the front three and then the relationship started to improve.\" \nThe underlying tensions that have often bubbled under the surface were brought to light again after the thumping Barca received in Paris, with Sergio Busquets saying the team had not expected Unai Emery's side to play as they did. The FC panel assess Luis Enrique's plans to leave Barcelona and discuss his chances of departing with a La Liga title. \n\"I don't think it's a case of the squad and coach not being able to stand each other, more that the relationship has become strained over time as happens in all walks of life,\" adds Condis. \nThe fact that Barca's players did not post any reaction to Luis Enrique's announcement on social media has been taken by some as another sign of their fractured relationship with the coach. \nEdgar Fornos, who used to work for Barcelona's TV channel and now covers the club for Catalan radio station RAC1, disagrees. \n\"I think that's because he hasn't left yet, there are still three very important months left in the season and it's time to focus on competing for trophies and not farewell speeches,\" he says. \"I think the club have probably told the players that. There will be time for goodbyes at the end of the campaign.\" \nFornos also believes the fact the coach keeps a certain distance between himself and the players does not mean they do not get along. \n\"Luis Enrique is a former footballer and he believes the dressing room is sacred for the players and not somewhere a coach should go,\" he adds. \"[Pep] Guardiola was more the type who would be closer to the players and be ready to put an arm round their shoulder. Luis Enrique is not like that, but it doesn't mean his door is not open to the players.\" \nWhile their personalities may contrast, there are many parallels between Guardiola and Luis Enrique's careers at Barca. \nAs well as having long and successful careers as Barca players, the former teammates had success with the B team before taking charge of the top job. They each won the treble in their first campaign, and, tellingly, also decided to quit after becoming worn out from the job. \nCondis, however, has little doubt over who will be remembered more fondly. \n\"Guardiola changed the history of Barca, of course Luis Enrique won the treble too, but for me, Pep got the team to play the most exciting football we've ever seen,\" she adds. \"But it's not just that, Pep had personality, the players could feel his presence on the pitch. He was the leader of the institution in so many ways. \n\"He will never be forgotten. Luis Enrique may have achieved many great things, but he won't be remembered in the same light as Pep.\" \nRichard Martin covers FC Barcelona for ESPN FC.
