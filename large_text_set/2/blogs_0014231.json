Canada now spends about one per cent and has long been under pressure from the U.S., including long before the start of the Trump era, to boost spending.\nThe government is looking at predictable, planned investments, Sajjan said.\n“We in Canada need to be able to demonstrate a thorough plan and what type of defence investment is needed, because this is significant money that needs to be invested, but the Canadian taxpayer also requires us to make sure that we are efficient with the money.”\nAs well as the NATO talks and a meeting with a counter-ISIL group led by Mattis, Sajjan also had bilateral meetings with the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and ministers from Australia, France, Germany, Portugal, Slovenia and the United Kingdom.\nHe is heading to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where senior decision-makers from around the world will discuss international security challenges.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:35:32.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
