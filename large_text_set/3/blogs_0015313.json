However, she later returned and divided the money with Patrick, whom she settled down with and married in 2004.\nThey ran the B&B together and even fostered a young girl for some time and later ran the Minute Mart together.\nHowever, things would come undone for Patrick and Yolande when Patrick was tempted into a fling with Pat Evans in 2006. When Stacey caught them together, Yolande was devastated and she ended up dishing out a whopper of a slap to Pat.\n(Picture: BBC) Deciding to get her own back on Patrick, she headed to a nightclub to pick up a man for a one night stand but found that she couldn’t go through with it.\nYolande forgave Patrick but he threw her out when he suspected that she had slept with his friend Aubrey. When Aubrey came clean that nothing happened, Patrick and Yolande reconciled again.\n\nIn 2008, Yolande’s exit story unfolded as Patrick caused food poisoning by selling food not properly chilled from the Minute Mart. Head Office were so impressed with Yolande’s methods of dealing with the crisis that they offered her a promotion that would take her to Birmingham.\nYolande accepted but Patrick wasn’t keen on the move so Yolande left alone, with Patrick promising to follow her. As fans know, he didn’t end up going and received his divorce papers in 2009.\n(Picture: BBC) Yolande has recently been mentioned a lot as Denise has been called for a disciplinary at the Minute Mart HQ – with Yolande reappearing to chair the meeting and give Denise a fighting chance – and she is a fierce and fair as we remember her.\n(Picture: BBC) But could she return again – and, if so, how would Patrick react to seeing his ex again?\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Lauren Branning tracks down her admirer but is he part of Max’s revenge? \nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Jay Brown’s underage girlfriend Star is back as part of Bex Fowler’s story ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:45:45.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
