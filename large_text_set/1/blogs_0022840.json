Without them, the web would be overrun by malicious bots and fake accounts — but even they're not perfect. \nYouTuber Matt Unsworth has uploaded a video of a robot that is able to get around them — by taking a particularly unconventional approach. \nThe Captcha the robot fools tracks the user's mouse movements to make sure they're a \"real\" human. So rather than trying to trick it with software — a tactic that can often be detected — it goes down the hardware route. Using a capacitive stylus, the robot physically moves the mouse on the trackpad, as if it were a real human wiggling their finger around. The computer doesn't stand a chance. \nThe robot uprising is right around the corner.
