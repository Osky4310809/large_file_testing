I said in simple jest that the congresswoman’s hair distracted me,” O’Reilly said. Again, as in his previous apology, he called his comments “stupid,” but did go on to say it “is necessary to analyze what’s being said” by Waters. \nOverall, the point of O’Reilly’s segment tonight was not to apologize again or even to focus on the reason he was trending on Twitter all day. Instead of spending much time on what he said about Waters, he defended Trump against   see him ousted as President because of his alleged Russian ties and more. \nHe said it would be good for the congresswoman to come on the Factor to defend her position, but then added that she would not because she didn’t want to be challenged. \n“That’s not patriotism, Madam,” he scolded. “It’s demagoguery.” \nIt was not immediately clear if he had invited her on the show or not. (She did appear on MSNBC with Chris Hayes tonight, which is in the same time slot on MSNBC.) \nWatch above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:18:10.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
