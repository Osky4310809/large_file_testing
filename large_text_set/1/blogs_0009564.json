With just 11 days left before President Obama leaves office, Spotify has gone ahead and posted a new job listing seeking a \"President of Playlists,\" and it appears they're looking for someone with \"presidential experience.\" The position is seeking a person to help in creating new playlist ideas (i.e. Workout Playlists , Summer Playlists etc. ); in addition they'll also \"attend daily briefings\" and the ideal candidate \"must have at least eight years experience running a highly-regarded nation\" and \"a good team spirit, excellent work ethic, a friendly and warm attitude, and a Nobel Peace Prize.\" Sounds like a role only one person can fill?\nSpotify's CEO Daniel Ek tweeted the job listing directly to President Obama as well:\nHey @BarackObama , I heard you were interested in a role at Spotify.
