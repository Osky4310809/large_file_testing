Inside this backpack were a number of items, including his lucky-MacBook Pro. \nSince I was on the ground like a tortoise you know with the backpack on me. The way that it ricocheted and entered my bag, that would have been my back. \nIt’s unknown if the assailant was actually intentionally aiming at Frappier, or anyone else in that vicinity of the airport, but the witness has shown off that MacBook Pro which has clearly borne the brunt of a stray bullet. The bullet appears to have entered the backpack from the rear, penetrated the MacBook Pro’s display, and carried on through to the side of the machine, eventually exiting through the device’s air vents on the side. \nAccording to official inspection of the MacBook and Frappier’s bag, law enforcement agents have determined that the bullet likely entered the bag through a small opening, making direct contact with the Apple notebook. \nAccording to CNN, the assailant in this instance, Esteban Santiago, had previously been in contact with the FBI claiming to be hearing voices in his head, and was subsequently checked into hospital for a mental health evaluation, of his own accord. Our condolences and deepest sympathies go out to those affected by this tragedy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:01:55.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
