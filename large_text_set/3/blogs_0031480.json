By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 27, 2017 9:52 AM Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked BJP workers not to take any contracts. (Source: PTI) \nIt’s not even been 10 days since Yogi Adityanath took over as the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and he has already thrown so many new surprises. After banning illegal slaughterhouses and asking Babus for work 18 hours in a day, Yogi has now put his own party workers on notice telling them they should not take any thekedari (contract work). This decision was taken after the new CM addressed a gathering in his constituency Gorakhpur. \nMahant Suresh Das of the Digambar Akhara in Ayodhya in presence of Yogi Adityanath said the Ram temple would be built now under the guidance of new Chief Minister. “Ram Janmabhoomi ka nirman hi Uttar Pradesh ka vikas hai. But we have a condition. Only the Ram temple can be built at the Ram Janmabhoomi, no mosque will be built there,” said Das claiming that no other party will have the majority in Rajya Sabha till 2018. He added that the temple can be built with constitutional guidelines under the ‘government of Maharaj ji’. \nYou may also want to watch: \nWhen Adityanath came to speak, he didn’t mention anything about the Ram temple or the Ayodhya issue but focused on a story about Tulsidas and the representative of Emperor Akbar who came with an invitation. When Tulsidas was invited by Akbar’s representative, Yogi said, he replied that he knew only one Raja — Ram. No office-bearer of the party or any public representative should undertake any thekedari. They should rather monitor them. And, if they find any discrepancy, they can inform me, so that action can be taken immediately against the guilty,” he said. \n“Time has come that we work 18-20 hours a day. There no time for any mauj masti. For the past few years, Uttar Pradesh has been defined as a state from whose boundaries begins darkness, from where pot-holed roads begin and the place from where women start to feel insecure. I want to break this mindset. There is no place for those who give patronage to goonda elements, mafia, criminal and other rogue elements. They have the option of leaving UP or else they will land in places designated for them (jails),” he added.
