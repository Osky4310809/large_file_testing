Granted, Clutch was in a large bear suit, but Biles was wearing some pretty tall shoes.\nThis is just something we love to see, athletes as fans. It’s especially great when someone shows up at an event outside the sport with which we normally associate them, like seeing your teacher in the grocery store as a kid. Or seeing Guy Fieri at the NBA All Star Weekend. \nIt may feel weird, but it’s sure as hell fun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:13:21.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
