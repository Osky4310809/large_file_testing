It had a real sense of finality, at least for the character of Sabine Wren, who left the team to go work towards uniting and freeing her people. While Lucasfilm and Disney XD remain mum on any official announcement of Star Wars Rebels Season 4, the show continuing on for at least one more year is likely. After a critically-acclaimed direct connection to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story , and some teased cameos and story ideas that have been talked about for some time, plus showrunner Dave Filoni teasing that Sabine will return before everything is all said and done, we should get a season 4 official announcement any day now. Until then, however, Filoni was able to address the sense of finality in this episode, and how he and his team are trying to bring this season to a close. \n\"I give a pretty good eye to that because I like where we got the end of last year, and it really shook things up,\" Filoni told ComicBook.com. \"Last season ending with kind of a dividing line between who the characters were and what they need to evolve into being, and I feel very good that this season drives us to a point where you can actually look and see these arcs within this season of where, say Kanan and Ezra, everyone started and where they end, and what the future may or may not hold for them. Imagining they survive, what's about to happen?\" \nIt's something Filoni focuses on at the end of each season now more than ever before, due to his experiences with Star Wars: The Clone Wars , the first animated series he showran for Lucasfilm, which ended abruptly. \n\"You always have an eye on it, and it's tricky. I have to be honest. It's tricky in TV having worked on a series that frankly didn't really have an all-out end like we had planned it. I'm always a bit wary. I'm thinking, 'Okay, where do we need this to go?'\" he said. \"Because I want to make sure that we take the audience in these Star Wars stories, I think, on this really, I hope, interesting and entertaining journey, and I want them to feel that they get a complete payoff for it, and that it's the story that we intended.\" \nAnd while he wouldn't budge on any kind of sudden official announcement, he did imply heavily that the story they intended has more story to tell beyond season 3. \n\"From the very beginning, Simon and I, working with the writers and story group have had a goal in mind of where we would like to get to with this, and we've been taking steps towards it along the way, and some surprising twists and turns even to us, but we always have a goal in mind of where we want to be,\" Filoni said. \"So, I think we have taken some strong steps towards that with always an eye on 'Does the adventure continue?' So we'll have to see. For Sabine, hopefully the adventure will continue. That would be great because then we can change her hair again. People love that,\" he said with a laugh. \nYes, people do, and hopefully we'll see her with an all new look next year in season four. \nStar Wars Rebels airs Saturdays at 8:30 p.m. ET/PT on Disney XD, and you can catch up anytime on demand or the WatchDisneyXD site and app. (Photo: Lucasfilm Animation)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:07:16.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
