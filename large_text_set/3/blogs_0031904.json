Luckily, Allison Kimmey, a mom and body-positivity advocate, has shown us how it’s done after she told her daughter that her stretch marks are called “glitter stripes,” and that they’re something a woman earns with age .\nCan we get an amen?! Kimmey wrote about the important body-positivity lesson in a Facebook post (that included an adorable photo of herself and her daughter, Cambelle).\n& Today while I was laying at the pool with my daughter: Her: \"Why is your tummy big mama?\"Me: \"What do you mean baby?\"...\nPosted by Allison Kimmey on  Monday, March 20, 2017 After Cambelle asked her mommy where her stretch marks came from, Kimmey responded by saying, “Well when I was a little older than you, I got some stripes when I grew really fast! And some of these stripes are from when I had you growing in my tummy…They are shiny and sparkly, aren’t they pretty?” \nAfter her daughter adorably responded with, “Yes, I like this one the best, it’s so glittery. When can I get some?” Kimmey continued her lesson in Loving Oneself 101, saying, “Oh you will get your glitter stripes when you get a little bit older baby!” \nAnd with that beautiful interaction, stretch marks have a fabulous new name.\nThe truth is that Kimmey is right , Cambelle probably will get glitter stripes when she’s older because even supermodels like Chrissy Teigen have them (and love them!) . So why would we ever feel bad about them? (Oh right, that little thing called the patriarchy…)\nAfter her original glitter stripes post went viral, Allison posted a follow-up message on Facebook about talking to children about their bodies.\n& Cambelle and I are just tickled pink that you all enjoyed our Glitter Stripes story so much! Talking to our children...\nPosted by Allison Kimmey on  Friday, March 24, 2017 She says, “It will never, ever be wrong to encourage a young person to love their body, even when t hat body doesn’t match society standards, even when you think that body might yield some bullying, self hate is never the answer. Teaching them to see the good in themselves and equipping them with strong beliefs that every body is a good body will speak volumes as they grow older and will create a new fierce, loving generation with humility and that is the best gift we can all give.” \nImagine a world full of kids like Cambelle who grow up into adults who believe — scratch that — know that “every body is a good body!” We could live in a wonderful land of self-love and lots and lots of pizza.\nWe love Allison’s lesson for Cambelle and all of us, really, because we’ll never disparage our glitter stripes by calling them stretch marks again.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:18:56.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
