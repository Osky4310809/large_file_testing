Dillard , whose directorial feature debut Sleight was one of the big buzz films of the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, is in talks to direct and co-write a remake of David Cronenberg ‘s classic horror film The Fly . Learn the details, after the jump.\n\nDillard will develop a screenplay with his writing partner Alex Theurer for 20th Century Fox, according to Deadline . The duo make Sleight together and are about to begin filming a horror/thriller called Sweetheart for Blumhouse starring Kiersey Clemons. I’m a fan of Dillard’s debut film, and noted in my Sundance review that he may have a big career ahead of him:\nDillard is a refreshing new filmmaker who is certainly one to watch. This may be his first feature film, but Dillard has directed some music videos and is also developing a film project for Bad Robot and Paramount Pictures (the details on this project are unknown). When I saw Safety Not Guaranteed at Sundance a few years back, I knew that Colin Trevorrow was about to be tapped for much bigger films (but even I wouldn’t have predicted Star Wars and Jurassic Park sequels). I think its easy to see Dillard will probably also capture the attention of Hollywood genre films — I could definitely see him at the helm of a future Marvel movie.\n\nThe official synopsis for Cronenberg’s The Fly follows:\nSeth Brundle ( Jeff Goldblum ) is a research scientist, employed by Bartok Sciences, who has invented ‘Telepods’ two matter transmission pods that teleports any object through space from one ‘Telepod’ to the other ‘Telepod.’ But, it is until Seth meets journalist Veronica Quaife ( Geena Davis ) who inspires Seth to correct the system, that Seth achieves successful teleportation. But something goes horribly wrong, when Seth uses himself as a guinea-pig in a matter transmission experiment, as he teleports himself, unaware his genes have been fused with a house fly that was trapped in the telepod with him. Seth, now finds himself slowly transforming into a terrifying mutant creature known as ‘Brundlefly’ as he finds himself in a fierce battle as his mutated genes begins to take over.\nI’m not as big of a fan of The Fly as most film fanatics, but I do think there is an opportunity to do something fun and different considering visual effects have progressed quite a bit in the last three decades. /Film managing editor Jacob Hall thinks both the original and the remake are masterpieces in their own right, so why not for a third time.\nCronenberg’s film was actually a remake of a 1958 movie produced and directed by Kurt Neumann and based on a short story of the same name by George Langelaan. The Fly had a sequel in 1989 starring Eric Stoltz and Curse of the Fly. Cronenberg had been rather vocal detractor to any proposed remake but in 2009 was considering remaking the film himself in 3D .\nThe post ‘The Fly’ Remake: ‘Sleight’ Director J.D.
