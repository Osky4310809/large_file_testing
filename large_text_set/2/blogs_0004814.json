We thought she was a black Labrador.\nGiant 'sea beast' photobombs a couple's romantic snap ‘But when Milly started to lick the placenta off she actually had a green tinge. We were laughing and saying no, this can’t be green.\n‘All the others are golden and this one’s green. It’s to do with the placenta, so it’s a phenomenon, it’s just very rare in dogs.\n(Picture: Ross Parry) (Picture: Ross Parry) ‘We were a bit shocked, then laughed and thought, ‘Oh my, is it ok’.’\nElaine, 56, and 46-year-old Mark are planning to sell the puppies once they’re old enough.\nBosses reveal the worst sickie excuses they've ever heard She added: ‘The colour’s faded now and she’s doing well even though she was the smallest of the litter, she’s so sweet.’\nElaine, who owns a motorhome business, has researched the condition online and has found just two other cases of Labradors born green – on in Spain and the other Clayton-le-Moors, Lancs., in 2012.\nWhile it stains, Fifi’s green tinge is only temporary and she will soon resemble her boisterous brothers.\n(Picture: Ross Parry)  \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:45:15.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
