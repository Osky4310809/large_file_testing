Reassurance: Experts say they hope it will help those unsure about quitting (PA wire) \nPrevious studies which suggested vaping is as harmful as smoking have little in common with real-world experience, it is claimed. \nLead author Dr Lion Shahab, from University College London, said: \"Our study adds to existing evidence showing that e-cigarettes and NRT are far safer than smoking, and suggests that there is a very low risk associated with their long-term use. \n\"We've shown that the levels of toxic chemicals in the body from e-cigarettes are considerably lower than suggested in previous studies using simulated experiments. This means some doubts about the safety of e-cigarettes may be wrong. \n\"Our results also suggest that while e-cigarettes are not only safer, the amount of nicotine they provide is not noticeably different to conventional cigarettes.
