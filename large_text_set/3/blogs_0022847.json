Bears, sea lions, seals, bald eagles and more can be easily spotted when you join us for a wildlife expedition. If you want to see one or more in their native environment, a wildlife tour is for you. Be sure to bring your camera and binoculars!\n\nSpasski River Valley Wildlife and Bear Search – This adventure takes you to the bush country of the Spasski River Valley in search of grizzly bears and other animals. From the viewing platforms overlooking the river, you may be lucky enough to spot bears that flock here all year long, in addition to Sitka black-tailed deer, land otters, salmon and bald eagles. Along the way to the river, an expert guide will talk about the history and culture of the Tlingit settlement.\n\nWhale Watching and Seafood Feast – Onboard a high-speed boat, you’ll cruise the waters of Icy Strait – past the magnificent scenery of Chichagof Island and the distant Glacier Bay – in search of orcas and humpback whales. As your guide describes the diversity of marine life that migrates here during the summer to feed in the nutrient-rich waters, keep your eyes peeled for sea lions, harbor seals, sea otters, porpoise and bald eagles, in addition to whales, of course. Back at Icy Strait Point, complete your adventure with a seafood feast of shrimp, crab, corn on the cob and Andouille sausage.\n\nForest and Nature Tram – Sit back and relax as you watch for deer, bears and eagles on a tram ride through lush, coastal woodlands. This guided tour through the rainforest also includes a stop at a secluded beach where you may catch a glimpse of whales, porpoises, seals and sea lions. No doubt there will be plenty of opportunities to take photographs on this awe-inspiring journey through Alaska’s wilderness. For an added cultural experience, consider joining us for the Forest Tram and Tribal Dance , where you’ll also visit the Native Heritage Center to see a lively Tlingit performance.\nNext up, I’ll give you my suggestions for excursions that emphasize the “adventure” in Port Adventure. Remember, when the ship’s in port, venture ashore!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:03:36.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
