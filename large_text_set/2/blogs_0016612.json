IPAs are so popular that they now account for about 25 percent of all domestic craft beer sales, according to data from Nielsen. Chances are you primarily drink West Coast-style IPAs, which focus heavily on hops and burst with citrusy notes. But it looks like there might be a new IPA sheriff in town: “Hazy” beers have suddenly hit the national beer scene , according to an NPR report. \nNPR traces the roots of the haze craze to 13 years ago in Waterbury, Vermont, where The Alchemist brewed up a thicker-than-usual beer that looked pulpy and opaque, sort of like orange juice. Brewer John Kimmich elected not to filter or pasteurize the beer, per NPR , resulting in the unique appearance and surprisingly delicious taste. The beer’s popularity prompted other East Coast brewers to concoct their own hazy beers over the next decade, but none of them have earned the same mythical status as the original; today, The Alchemist’s Heady Topper is one of the most revered IPAs in America.
