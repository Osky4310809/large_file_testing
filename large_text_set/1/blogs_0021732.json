Theo Wargo/Getty \nActress and political activist Ashley Judd brought the house down at the Women's March on Washington, a rally that drew an estimated 500,000 demonstrators Â in protest of President Donald Trump. \nCrowds went berserk for the big-screen actress as she waxed poetic in R-rated language on women's rights and the perceived threat the new administration poses to those liberties. \nJudd read a poem from 19-year-old spoken word poet, Nina Donovan, from her home state of Tennessee. The actress shared a video of Donovan to her Facebook page late last year. \n\"I am a nasty woman. Not as nasty as a man who looks like he bathes in Cheetoh dust,\" she began, eliciting cheers from the main stage area on Independence Avenue. \nYou can watch the speech below. \nJudd took the main stage while filmmaker Michael Moore still stood at the podium. \n\"My name is Ashley Judd, and I am a feminist,\" she said, as Moore watched on smiling. \nWomen's March on Washington organizers insisted leading up to event â which is expected to draw nearly a quarter of a million people â that the demonstration was more pro-women than anti-Trump. But as Judd recited Donovan's words, it became clear she would not pass on the opportunity to take angled digs at the new administration. \nMuch of the poem played on the theme of what it means to be a nasty woman, in reference to a remark Trump made against Hillary Clinton during the last presidential debate. \n\"I'm not nasty, like the combo of Trump and Pence being served up to me in my voting booth. I'm nasty like the battles my grandmothers fought to get me into that voting booth,\" she said. â Vox (@voxdotcom) January 21, 2017 \nAnother line called out Trump's unsettling record of comments about the attractiveness of his daughter Ivanka: \"I'm not as nasty as your daughter being your favorite sex symbol.\" \nThe poem hit on why tampons are taxed but Rogaine and Viagra aren't, the pay gap in Hollywood, and sexual harassment. \n\"We are not here to be debunked, we are here to be respected,\" she said. \"We are here to be nasty. I'm nasty, like the blood stains on my bed sheets.\" \nPeople took to social media to express their admiration for Judd. \nIf @AshleyJudd ever runs for anything, she's got my vote. #WomensMarch â Laurie Crosswell đ (@lauriecrosswell) January 21, 2017 \n#WomensMarch @AshleyJudd \"is a nasty woman\" poem so powerful!
