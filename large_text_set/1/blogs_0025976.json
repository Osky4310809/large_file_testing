That's enough. \n“In Spain there is a saying: ' demasiada agua mata la planta '– too much water kills the plant. It's the same with training. \n“The dosage must be right. You can train hard, but you have to give the body the chance to relax.” \n'Good luck passing your medical without a spine, Payet!' \nOne player who will be happy of the additional rest time is one Philipp Lahm, who, at 33, could be gearing up for full retirement. \nAncelotti, however, has made clear his stance of the matter, urging the former Germany captain to emulate an Italian great. \n“It's Philipp's decision, of course,” he said. “But I told him that I want him to continue playing until the end of his contract in 2018. \n“He is fit and has no problems – he could be the next Paolo Maldini.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T07:36:45.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
