Day of the Dead Has Been Celebrated in Mexico for At Least 3,000 Years A couple disguised as dead poses at San Jeronimo Chicahualco cemetery in Metepec, Mexico on November 2, 2013 during the commemoration of the Day of the Dead. (Getty) \nThe Day of the Dead tradition is rooted in Mexican culture and has been celebrated for thousands of years. It was first a part of the Aztec culture, but became mixed with Christian beliefs when the Spaniards came to Mexico, according to the Arizona Republic: \nUnlike the Spaniards, who viewed death as the end of life, the natives viewed it as the continuation of life. Instead of fearing death, they embraced it. To them, life was a dream and only in death did they become truly awake. However, the Spaniards considered the ritual to be sacrilegious. They perceived the indigenous people to be barbaric and pagan. \nIn their attempts to convert them to Catholicism, the Spaniards tried to kill the ritual. But like the old Aztec spirits, the ritual refused to die. To make the ritual more Christian, the Spaniards moved it so it coincided with All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day (Nov. 1 and 2), which is when it is celebrated today. \nAccording to the National Endowment for the Humanities , “The Aztec Festival of the Dead was originally a two-month celebration during which the fall harvest was celebrated, and figures of ‘death’ were personified as well as honored. The festival was presided over by Mictecacíhuatl, Goddess of the Dead and the Underworld, also known to the Aztecs as Mictlán. In the pre-Columbian belief system, Mictlán was not dark or macabre, but rather a peaceful realm where souls rested until the days of visiting the living, or los Días de los Muertos, arrived. Over the course of the festivities, participants place offerings for the dead in front of homemade altars, including special foods, traditional flowers, candles, photographs, and other offerings.” 4. Families Traditionally Visit the Gravesites of Their Loved Ones on Day of the Dead People visit a cemetery in Tlacotepec, Puebla State, Mexico on November 2, 2012 during the commemoration of Mexico’s Day of the Dead.

The family may keep a night-long vigil by eating the foods they have made in preparation for the celebration, visiting with each other, and praying for all the members of the extended family, both living and dead,” the NEH website says. 5. The Holiday Is Also Celebrated in Parts of the United States & Latin America \nThe Day of the Dead holiday is also celebrated in the United States, especially in cities with large populations of people with Mexican ancestry, and parts of Latin America. \nFamilies often build altars in their homes to dedicate to their deceased loved ones, surrounding them with flowers, food and pictures. They also light candles next to the altars. According to the Associated Press , Day of the Dead celebrations are growing across the U.S. Major celebrations are held each year in Texas, New Mexico, California and many other areas. \nVersions of the holiday are also celebrated in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Guatemala.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T02:30:15.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
