Then-soon-to be National Security Adviser General Michael Flynn was an American who was incidentally intercepted during his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. \nA warrant was not necessary to review his conversations because it was a national security matter and Flynn had a security clearance, sources told Circa. \nThe calls and text messages from last December to the ambassador were essentially holiday wishes and condolences for tragedies that had happened in Russia at the time. Another conversation, via text message about talking on the phone, was about sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration in late December. \n“[B]ut the message the American official gave was mostly that a new sheriff was about to take over the White House and Russians shouldn’t react to the new sanctions in a way that would foreclose better dialog in the future under a Trump administration, sources said,” Circa reported. \nWho leaked Flynn’s name to the media? The leaks began in January after   changed a long time executive order that enabled information intercepted from FISA warrants or by the National Security Agency to be pooled out to 16 other federal agencies \nSuch sensitive information is normally given to eight top leaders in Congress, who are regularly briefed by the intelligence community about classified matters. But after president Obama changed the executive order before he left office, a massive number of staff throughout the government had access to the information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:01:17.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
