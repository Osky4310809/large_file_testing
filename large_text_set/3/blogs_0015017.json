By: FE Online | Updated: March 15, 2017 6:04 PM Motorola Moto G5 vs Xiaomi Redmi Note 4: Which smartphones should you buy? \nMotorola, after a long time, has launched a phone in the G series and the Moto G5 is now available on Flipkart . Meanwhile, Xiaomi ’s Redmi Note 4 is a hugely popular phone in India and has witnessed rapid sales. The 3GB RAM variant of the Moto G5 is available at Rs 14,999 and the 4GB RAM version comes with a price tag of Rs 16,999. Meanwhile, the Redmi Note 4 starts from Rs 9,999 which is the basic variant of 2GB RAM. The Redmi Note 4 3GB RAM and 4GB RAM variants costs Rs 10,999 and Rs 12,999 respectively. While both the devices have their pros and cons, the higher price tag for Moto G5 might hurt it a bit as Xiaomi offers almost the same specifications at a much lower price and a bigger battery with a bigger screen. Moto G5, however, appears to have a smoother interface and better camera quality. So, it is up to the user what preferences does the user have while selecting the smartphone as these two devices are the best in the mid-budget segment right now. Here are some of the specifications you should look for before choosing one of these smartphones: \nDisplay \nMoto G5 Plus features a 5.2-inch Full-HD display with Gorilla Glass 3. Meanwhile, Redmi Note 4 comes with a 5.5 inch Full HD display with 2.5D curved glass. Since the display size is relatively bigger in the Redmi Note 4, the difference may be deemed negligible. However, the weight of the device might be an issue as with larger screens the total mass also increases. Redmi Note 4’s screen has a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080p and pixel density of 403ppi, while the Moto G5 Plus screen has a resolution of 1,920×1,080p and pixel density of 424ppi. \nOperating System \nThe Moto G5 Plus runs Android 7.0 (Nougat) out of the box alongside a near stock version of Android UI. Meanwhile, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 runs Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) with its own UI on top. Xiaomi has promised Nougat on the smartphone, though, but it may not be as quick as that of the Motorola device. Both Moto G5 Plus and Redmi Note 4 are driven by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor. \nBattery \nMotorola’s Moto G Plus features a 3,000mAh battery, while Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has a 4,100 battery. But the size of the former is smaller as well as the UI is a lot less cluttered, which means the lifetime of the battery will almost be the same, but Redmi Note 4 still has the edge. \nBuild \nThe Moto G5 has an all metal build which makes it close to the Redmi Note 4 regarding the body quality as well as design. But Moto G5 gets fewer fingerprints on its body and also has a water repellant build because of a nano-coating, which scores above the Xiaomi device. The Moto phone weighs 155g, a bit lesser than Redmi Note 4 at 175g. \nCamera \nThe Motorola Moto G5 Plus has a 12-megapixel rear camera with f/1.7 aperture, dual-LED flash, AutoFoucs and 4K video recording. The Redmi Note 4 contains a 13 megapixel CMOS camera with f/2.0, dual-tone LED flash and Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF). On the front, it has a 5-megapixel camera alongside f/2.0 aperture and HD video recording. The phone features a 5-megapixel camera with a f/2.2 aperture on a front. In terms of video recording, both the smartphones offer it in 1080p at 30fps.
