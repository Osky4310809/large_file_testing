Then you’ll totally understand this funny Wheel of Fortune viral fail , which had Twitter buzzing last night.\nThe category was “Title,” and the contestants were just one letter away from the final answer . For those of you who love literature, the puzzle seemed pretty obvious at this point. On the board, the contestants were just one letter away from A Streetcar Named Desire , which is an incredibly popular book by Tennessee Williams.\nBut, a contestant named Kevin must have never read it. In fact, it sounded like he had something else on his mind entirely. And for the win... @WheelofFortune #wheeloffortune #lol pic.twitter.com/ICBeU51GmU \n— Jamie Hawryliak (@jamiehawryliak) March 21, 2017 It seems like even Pat Sajak, who has likely heard everything by this point, was even a little bit confused by this one.\nAfter the funny fail, Twitter couldn’t help but poke a little bit of fun at him. We mean, he did just say “naked desire” on television.\nFeeling for \"Streetcar Naked Desire\" guy tonight on @WheelofFortune . The real life Joey: pic.twitter.com/p0uezhtvMX \n— S.E. Cupp (@secupp) March 21, 2017 A \"k\"? Really? Pat's \"n \" is amazing. #wheeloffortune pic.twitter.com/ylfUxwRulo \n— Sarah VanMetre (@sarahvan24) March 21, 2017 Never really was a fan of A Streetcar Named Desire, but I might be now #WheelOfFortune \n— Jess (@jetski85) March 22, 2017 I'm eagerly waiting the Broadway production of \"A Streetcar Naked Desire\" to come to Canada #WheelOfFortune #NakedStreetcar \n— Tim Parent (@timparent) March 22, 2017 This guy on wheel of fortune just guessed \"A Streetcar Naked Desire\" I'm so done pic.twitter.com/ZsYdc3BmAA \n— Emily Weiss (@emily_weiss28) March 21, 2017 Poor Kevin. Poor, poor Kevin.\nSajak made a light joke about the mistake, which surely will be plaguing Kevin for quite some time. According to the Wheel of Fortune YouTube account , another moment was a little more shareable — contestant Lisa’s mighty scream over winning big during one particular round.\nThey even went so far as to make “#SquealOfFortune” a legit hashtag — but, sadly, nothing will totally take away from the attention of Kevin, whose moment was much more memorable.\nKeep in mind that contestants on both Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy have to go through pretty extensive testing before making it on air. That means that Kevin is obviously a smart guy who understands how the game works — he just probably had the most unfortunate mental lapse in recent game show history.\nWe wouldn’t be surprised if sales for A Streetcar Named Desire happened to rise after this little snafu!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:12:20.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
