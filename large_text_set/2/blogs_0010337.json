Sue Bamblett's letter to her tragic grandsons \nDear Jacob and George \nI didn’t get to see you in your school nativity - George, such a serious Innkeeper, and Jacob fidgety in a scratchy shepherd’s costume. I chose Christmas presents for you – I popped them in the Salvation Army collection box. \nI can't believe you are five already. Izzie and Poppy sang Happy Birthday and blew out your candles. You sent me a double rainbow, soaring high above my neighbours rooftops. \nLast June, when my buddleia came into bloom, I watched as you played tag around the bush, tumbling and frolicking in the sunshine. \nEvery summer I gather pebbles and shells for your sandcastles, and each autumn I fill my pockets with conkers - burnished brown like grandad’s polished brogues \nJacob, I see you when Cousin Josh kicks a ball, and I glimpse you in Poppy's cheeky grin. George, I hear you in Izzie’s giggle, and see you in Cousin Eloise's funny frown. I feel you both as the sun warms my face, but when my other grandkids are chasing around the garden, two of the gang are missing. Sue, from East Sussex, tells her grandsons: \"I won't ever forget you – I carry you with me always and forever\" (Photo: tamba) \nIzzie tells me you are stars in the sky, but she wishes you’d come down and play. I wish that too. \nJacob, in one breath we said hello and goodbye. I watched your little face - eyes tightly closed. A flutter of life as an angel tickled your nose – I wish my gentle breath could have filled your lungs with oxygen… I rocked you gently, and told you how much we all love you – Mummy, Daddy, your brother George - such a big loving family. You left us with an ache in our arms, and a gaping hole in our hearts. \nGeorge, as I cradled you, you reminded me of my dad – arms folded and slightly irritated as if someone had disturbed you - long fingers and your mummy's rosebud lips. Poor little soldier, you’d been through such a battle… You are Jacob’s big little brother - now you must look after each other. \nMy darling grandsons, I wish you’d had more time with your mummy and daddy, because your mummy and daddy are truly amazing. \nI won't ever forget you – I carry you with me always and forever. I’m so grateful I had the chance to hold you and tell you how much you mean to me. \nAll my love. \nSue Bamblett, from Crowborough, East Sussex A midwife's letter to a new mum \nDear Sophie, \nOn Valentine’s Day and I want to share a few things with you. \nI remember meeting you in Fetal Medicine after you had been seen for TTTS (twin to twin transfusion syndrome) and had laser surgery, only to then be diagnosed with IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction). \nStaff members were not very optimistic about the chances of one of your twin girls surviving the pregnancy. You were so upbeat and hopeful and happy. \nThat really touched me profoundly. In the midst of your dark cloud, you had this wonderful sunny disposition. Sandra Bosman has written a moving letter to an \"upbeat\" and \"happy\" new mum (Photo: tamba) \nBy this time I saw you had booked onto my one of the antenatal classes. I reluctantly left a message on your answerphone telling you not to come to the classes because it was a bit too early to attend. You did not get the message and I saw you and your partner there. I was a bit taken aback but said nothing. \nYou and another mum clicked immediately and the two of you made the most noise in the class, creating a lovely atmosphere for everyone. You never mentioned or let on what your situation was and therefore did not alarm anyone. \nAgain, this was so commendable because you had a potentially big audience with lots of sympathy available. \nThen you delivered one day. It all happened very fast, as we had anticipated. I saw you on the ward and the babies were transferred out to a hospital south from here. Totally expecting a stressed out mother in a heap of panic and worry, I found you in your bed smiling, positive and cheerful. I have been doing this job for some years now and I am used to seeing people cry and wiping their tears but there were none. Your mum sat beside your bed, so proud of you for being brave and amazing. I always have something to say, but this time I was lost for words. The midwife, pictured cradling three other babies, specialises in multiple birth pregnancies (Photo: tamba) \nYou struck me as the most amazing, incredible woman I have ever met. You were so brave and positive. \nThat little girl of yours is still in the special care baby unit growing and I have no doubt that you have brought lots of sunshine into the life of this hospital. \nI am in awe of your resilience and admire you greatly, you are strong and brave and amazing. I rejoice with you in the very amazing and happy ending. \nYou will be a wonderful mother. \nSandra BosmanMidwife for Multiple Birth Pregnancies Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust A mum's letter to her twin daughters \nDear Alice and Beatrice, \nNo one told me what to expect. How can you put it into words? I never thought to explore what was going to be expected of me when the time came. \nI just focussed on one stage at a time, whilst you were inside me, a stage I embraced whole-heartedly and loved. I felt connected to the two of you but somehow out of the club. I was and am cool with that status, I love the bond that you two have and hope never to challenge or compete with it. \nNo one told me to prepare myself to fall in love with two people at the same time. It took me a while, I won’t lie, and at times I found that nature took over and my love would sway towards one of you more than the other. \nIt took everything from me to fall in love with both of you. I gave it willingly, unconditionally and solidly but I think it was the most challenging thing I’ve ever done. I am pleased to say I got there. We stay there and remain there forever. Beatrice (left) and Alice are pictured with their parents at a younger age (Photo: tamba) \nNo one told me that you would be called “the twins” by people that love you, that know you and by people that are passing through our lives. \nThat’s not how I see you. I never use that title unless it’s to justify my stretch marks or my lack of sleep in the early days. Admittedly, I sometimes call you my chalk and cheese, I love that you are so different and share some similarities. \nI see you as two sisters that just so happened to be born at the same time, two best friends that happen to be sisters. You two are so lucky to have each other. When I’m gone I know not to worry, your love for each other is the strongest kind of love. \nNo one told me that having two babies, two toddlers, two soon-to-be teenagers changes everything. It creates an instant family - there is no dress rehearsal, no easing you in……overnight we became a family of four. Emmy says: \"No one told me that having two babies, two toddlers, two soon-to-be teenagers changes everything\" (Photo: tamba) \nFor us, Mummy and Daddy, that was perfect, it was equal, there was no arguing about who had done what, when and how little sleep was had like our peers were doing. We were both in deep, stayed focussed and kept strong. \nYou did that, you made that bond between us and thanks to you and all your challenges no one can take that away from us. \nNo one told me that having you would make me whole, complete my life and purpose - anything extra is a bonus. Making you two so perfectly and beautifully blows my mind. How did we do that and so well? \nHand on my heart, you two are my best creation ever! The proud mum adds: \"Hand on my heart, you two are my best creation ever!\" (Photo: tamba) \nNo one told me that I would experience love and strength like this, thank you for giving that to me - that has to be the best gift ever. \nI’m going to tell you to stay there my loves, remain there forever. \nLove Mummy x Emmy Scarterfield, North London A teen's letter to her triplet sisters \nTo my darling triplet sisters, \nYou stand by me day by day whenever I need support and to have that unconditional bond is more special than people imagine. \nThere is something I would like to say to you and although you will probably groan and say it’s cheesy, I feel that it is important. \nKelsey, although you’re younger by a minute, you have taught me things beyond your years. I am now calm in situations that I would have been angry in and I have learnt from you that life is not a simple ride up an escalator but a difficult climb that we all need to take at our own pace. Charlotte Elliott is pictured with her sisters, with whom she has an \"unconditional bond\" (Photo: tamba) \nPhoebe, you’re the old bean, although again by only a minute. Your quirky sense of humour and dazzling smile radiate off you to cheer up everyone around. You need to understand that we are all with you for whatever comes and you have absolutely nothing to fear from the future. \nWoman who suffered miscarriage sacked on 'health and safety grounds' after asking to miss meeting with pregnant colleague \nBoth of you make up my entire life and I just want you to know that even when our lives take us in different directions, whether that be due to University or taking new steps in our lives, we will always be close in heart and you can talk to me at any point. I don’t want there to be silence when our own families begin to grow, I want and need us to be as strong as we are now forever and always. \nWe have many memories together and although not all of them are good it doesn’t take away how genuine I am being when I say that I love you both, more than either of you can imagine. Stay With me forever. <3 \nCharlotte xx Charlotte Elliott, 16, from near Peterborough To find out more about Tamba, a UK-wide charity supporting multiple birth families, click here .
