As Ben Mee lunged a foot out to clear an Alexis Sanchez service, the Burnley defender caught Laurent Koscielny in the face — giving Arsenal a penalty of its own. #ICYMI Alexis Sanchez bails 10-man Arsenal out with stoppage-time penalty kick #PLonNBC pic.twitter.com/A4zwzZkBVj — NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) January 22, 2017 \nSanchez calmly chipped down the middle as Tom Heaton dived to his right, launching Arsenal into second place in the Premier League with a heart-stopping victory.
