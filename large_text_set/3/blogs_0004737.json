Trump’s tweets followed Levin and others in the conservative media who alleged that federal agencies had been seeking to conduct surveillance of Trump Tower since last June. The reports suggested that the initial surveillance target was a Russian bank communicating with a server in Trump Tower. \nAlthough Trump’s tweets have been roundly criticized by former Obama administration officials and the mainstream media, reports by the New York Times and other media beginning in January indicate wiretap information was being used by someone within the Obama administration.   Anthony Shaffer: Allegations Of Obama Wiretapping Represent ‘Soviet-Dictator Level Wrongdoing’ \nLevin noted the fact that since Trump’s claims can be buttressed by reports by the media, many media organizations are unsettled. \n“The media is very confounded right now,” Levin said during an appearance on Hannity . “They’re very confused. They don’t know whether to trash themselves, trash their colleagues, or what. You asked the question, you said ‘what did Obama know?’ We know he knows this much – everything you just read, he knew, because it’s in the newspapers. That’s pretty big.” \nSpeaking on Hannity Monday night, Levin said that accounts of the surveillance indicate what took place would not have happened without Obama being informed.   \n“… we know that if a FISA warrant was secured, it’s very likely, in his daily intelligence briefing or a call from the attorney general, or the director of the FBI, the president would be given a heads up. There’s nothing illegal about it. But he’d be given a heads up,” Levin said. \nLevin said that given the likelihood that multiple agencies were investigating, it strains credulity to believe former President Barack Obama was totally in the dark. \n“There’s all kinds of, based on these reports, investigative activities going on. Y’know McClatchy reported the agencies involved, the FBI, CIA, the National Security Agency, Justice Department, Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. I assume Obama knew something,” he said.   Gowdy: Evidence So Far Lacking To Support Trump’s Wiretap Claim \nLevin said the surveillance conducted was not one small, rogue operation, but what he termed “police state tactics.” \n“The reason I got fed up with this last week is I’m a constitutional conservative ,” Levin said. “We have a runaway executive branch. I don’t know who knows what, and as of today, the media don’t appear to know who knows what, which is exactly why I’ve been calling for a congressional investigation.” \nLevin ridiculed the denial of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who has sought to rebut Trump’s claims. \n“Why all the investigations?” Levin asked. “Was there evidence – a scintilla of evidence at all – that Trump, his campaign advisers, and his transition team were on the take?” \n“None,” host Sean Hannity replied. \n“OK, then, why are six federal departments and agencies involved in an investigation and now Clapper says he doesn’t know anything?” Levin responded. \nLevin said there is currently a flood of information, but few answers. \n“We have a real problem right now,” Levin said. “The media’s turning on the media, we have leaks coming out that are felonies, we have stories about six federal departments and agencies – intelligence and law enforcement – that were investigating something, somebody, somehow. So what’s the answer?” \nLevin noted that the mainstream media is a major part of the story. \n”… the news media reported the leaks. The news media reported the surveillance. The news media reported it repeatedly. This is the mainstream media. As far as I know they’ve never retracted the story. And everybody knew about it, it was not something that was hidden. Now in fact, Donald Trump somehow mentions that in fact it happened, and somehow this is a ‘oh my gosh, this is outrageous.’ What do we, how do we definitively find out that in June and again in October there were attempt to surveil the then-candidate of the opposition party by the current administration at the time, the Obama administration?” he said. \nLevin called for two actions to take place. \n“Number one, the FISA applications … should be released. That’s number one,” he said, referring to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act documents that are required to be submitted when an agency wishes to conduct surveillance on a U.S. citizen. \nFurther release of other information is also essential, he said. \n“The warrant that was supposedly secured, in October, should be released. The other thing that needs to be done is these daily presidential briefings that the president received that the intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies coordinate on and prepare. The intelligence committee chairman, needs to read them. And now we’ll get to the bottom of this,” he said, adding, “Let Congress finally step up and do its job. They have Oversight Committees, we pay these people to do their jobs.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
