Thanks for your reaction Don’t forget to share this with your friends! ← Use Arrows Keys → 1 Gigi Hadid Hooked Up Zayn Malik's New Design Gig, but He's Already a Pro on His Own \nDonatella Versace decided Zayn Malik was the perfect rockstar to front her label, Versus, when she saw how he treated Gigi. \"The way he treats Gigi, like a gentleman: you don't see this anymore . . . I just saw them together. I went for dinner and I was impressed how mature he was,\" the designer explained to Vogue in an exclusive interview about the new partnership. \nNot only will Zayn be releasing his first collection in May (a portion of the proceeds will go to charity), but he'll also star in campaigns for the fashion house, just like his girlfriend has . Donatella, who consistently embraces the edgy and bold when it comes to both her labels, hinted at future collaborations with musicians. But for now, Zayn is her man. \nThe former One Direction member counts Prince in his iconic red suit as one of the most memorable Versace moments, but read on to see a few of Zayn's, all of which make him the right dude to take on such an honorable role.
