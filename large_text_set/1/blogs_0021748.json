The siblings grew up together in California but later drifted apart over the years. \nTom hit the headlines last week when he was accused of fighting with partner Darlene during a drunken row at their home.

Their relationship has been going from strength to strength and this drama is the last thing I wanted to happen. \n“I want to tell Meghan I am truly sorry from the bottom of my heart. The last thing I would ever want to do is put a black mark on her situation with the royals.” Meghan is best known for her role in legal show Suits (Photo: Getty Images North America) \nTom’s partner Darlene added she’s also keen for a wedding invite, should Harry pop the question to his actress girlfriend. \n“I would love to meet the royals,” she said. “I’d buy the prettiest dress if Tom and I can go to Meghan’s wedding.” \nTom was arrested by sheriff's officers in the US state of Oregon and charged with a number of gun offences earlier this month, after he was accused of holding a gun to partner Darlene's head. \nHowever, he has categorically denied holding the gun to her head.

I am seeking help and I promise I will be the best person I can be going forward. Thank you for understanding.” \nWhile his 24-year-old son Tyler added to The Sun: “He knows it is an embarrassment to Meghan and the family. He is very sorry and is apologising to everyone. He just needs some time to heal and reflect on life. But he wants to apologise for everything. He is in the spotlight now and everyone gets to see his flaws.\" \nTom was arrested at a home in Grants Pass, Oregon, and booked into Josephine County Jail on three charges.

He will be going to court for it.\" \nMs Dooley said Tom used to be very close to his sister Meghan but \"there has been some separation over the years\". \nShe added: \"I don’t want this to be embarrassing for Meghan. Tom has had a little fame and publicity since Meghan started dating Prince Harry. He wants what’s best for her. He is so happy and proud for her.\" Will Harry pop the question to Meghan? (Photo: AFP) \nMs Dooley said her ex-husband has alcohol issues, sharing: \"I hope this incident helps him get the help he needs to deal with alcohol issues he might have. All of his family love and support him and are very concerned about him. He needs to recognise if he has a problem and seek the help he needs.\" \nTom previously said his father was \"proud\" of Meghan's relationship with the royal and claimed the 72-year-old had met the Prince in Toronto where Meghan lives. \n\"My dad knew about [the relationship] from the start,\" he told DailyMail.com. \nMeghan and Harry have been pictured together in London several times since he confirmed they were dating and were recently rumoured to have enjoyed their first holiday together.
