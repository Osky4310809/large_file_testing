The time of year when the world comes together to celebrate the continually uniting and unanimously adored world of music, melody and, of course, cleavage. \nStars TURNED UP AND TURNED OUT this year and so did their number one (and two) ladies. \nHey, if you’ve got it — flaunt it.That’s what I ALWAYS say. \nOK, you caught me; that’s me and my dog, not a celebrity. \nHere are the celebrities. Let’s start with the OG queen of pop, the one, the only — Ms. Britney Spears. REX/Shutterstock \nHALLO LADY(s)! \nBritney (bitch) hit the carpet in a jaw-dropping sheer mini dress, and no one was mad. “Confident” singer Demi Lovato also arrived, bringing her amazing chest — we mean — confidence with her. REX/Shutterstock \nIn an otherwise fairly modest long-sleeved, slim-fitting gown, Demi decided to accentuate her toned, contoured cleavage — and, like, not that I would ever tell this bad-ass lady what to do, but I am just going to say SHE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. \n— Elite Daily (@EliteDaily) February 13, 2017 Next, we have the always fearless, endlessly inspiring and terrifying (in a good way) Lady Gaga.

Inside boob isn’t what the kids are calling it these days? “Closer” singer Halsey had us all wanting to get closer to her.

Red Carpet couldn’t help but get an eyeful of Tinashe and her fashion wonder. REX/Shutterstock \nAnd to her, we say, bravo, babe. BRAVO. \nIf you need me, I’ll be over here watching the rest of the evening dipping french fries in frosting thinking about buying a push-up bra on Amazon. \nHappy Grammying! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
