Although, we're also hearing Paul's planning on rewriting the lyrics to more closely resemble Donald's demeanor .\nMay we suggest, Mein Way ??\nHowever, in typical Trump fashion, the source close to Paul's production actually insulted other A-Listers who've refused to perform so far, saying:\n\"Paul was asked by the members of the Trump inauguration committee and he was only too happy to do it for his longtime friend. While everyone else was running scared from performing at the inauguration, Paul stood fast. He wasn't about to be intimated by anyone.\"\nYeah… Standing up to an open racist/sexist/all around bigot is definitely the definition of \"running scared.\"\nBut in all seriousness, Paul and the president-elect are longtime friends outside of politics — so if anyone was going to have to shower the new POTUS with song, we're glad it's someone voluntarily doing so.\nDo U think Paul Anka is the right choice for Donald Trump's inauguration??\n[ Image via Apega/Dennis Van Tine/Future Image/ WENN .] \nTags: canadialand , donald trump , inauguration , mormon tabernacle choir , music minute , paul anka , politik , super seniors , the rockettes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:52:49.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
