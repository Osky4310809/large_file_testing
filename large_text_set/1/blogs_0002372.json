An AFC executive told Breer he's the best receiver in the 2017 draft class. \nIf the redshirt junior comes out, as expected . Jamie Squire/Getty Images Williams can't quite reach a pass against Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl. \nBefore we go further, let's stick with the here and now, and the immediate future of Monday's College Football Playoff National Championship. The one thing Alabama doesn't do so well (cover in the secondary) leaves the Crimson Tide open to the one thing Clemson did better than any Power Five school over the last four months: pitch and catch. \nThis season, Williams has caught 90 passes for 1,267 yards and 10 touchdowns, many of which were worthy of one or more of his multiple highlight reels . On 3rd-and-4 or longer , he has 21 catches for 366 yards, a 17.4-yard average, with 15 first downs and three touchdowns. \nThe best indicator of just how important he is to the Tigers: In Clemson's offense, the boundary receiver is the most important spot in the passing game, co-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott said. He has to catch 80 to 90 percent of balls thrown his way. Williams has never dipped below the high-80s all season. \nThat Williams is even here to play at all, a year after he was pushed head-first into a goal post as he caught a touchdown pass in the 2015 season opener, breaking a bone in his neck, is where this story begins. \nYou don't leap in the air for a ball and come down just short of the goal post, with nowhere to go but head-first into the dark uncertainty of a neck injury, then spend a few weeks in rehab and jump right back into it. \n\"You're not outworking that injury,\" Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney said. \"You're praying and hoping and doing everything the doctor says and hoping to get a second chance.\" \nWell, sort of. Share \nIf you're Williams, and you grew up a two-sport star in Vance, and literally (not figuratively) everyone knows you and you know everyone, and they've seen you walk off the basketball court with an ankle that swelled to the size of your knee seconds after the ankle bone touched the floor, there's no way you're sitting and waiting and hoping. \nPraying, yes—but even the healer Himself needs a nudge every once in a while. \n\"I probably shouldn't say this because no one knows this; I've never told anyone,\" Williams said. \"But I was moving my neck two or three weeks after it happened. It's like when you hurt your ankle and it's tight. You're just moving it slowly because it's stiff. Just trying to work it out.\" \nSo there's Williams, not even a month from an injury that could prevent him from ever playing again, forced to wear a large, hard neck brace for 24 hours a day—not one of those soft, cushioned braces that immediately comes to mind—gradually moving his neck on his own. \nNot while others were around, when he had to turn his entire body to look left and right and to see and speak. And not when he had to endure the indignity of walking around campus with everyone staring at him, a 6'3\", 225-pound dude with a brace on his neck. \nBut when he was alone. When his mind would replay the injury. When his heart was tortured as he watched his teammates roll through a special 2015 season without him. They'd be practicing, he'd be in the locker room, lightly running back and forth when he wasn't supposed to. Jim Rogash/Getty Images \nThey forged an unbeaten season before losing in the CFP National Championship to Alabama. He counted the days until the Clemson medical staff told him he could play again. \nThe staff that had no idea what he was doing away from their care. \n\"I didn't know that happened until now,\" said Danny Poole, Clemson's director of sports medicine. \"It's certainly not something you like [to hear]. It's not a typical injury. The only way it heals is through time.\" \nThat's the last thing Williams had. Had everything gone as planned in 2015, he would have declared for the NFL draft after the season, and by now he'd be on his way to trying to live up to the Megatron comparisons. \nHad Williams not run head-on into an involuntary, eight-month vacation, Alabama would've had no answer for him last January—and maybe the Tigers would've won their first national title since 1981. It's not hard to do the math. \nClemson's most productive receiver in that 45-40 loss was Hunter Renfrow, a former walk-on quarterback turned wideout. No disrespect to Renfrow, who has developed into a quality option for Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson, but he's no Megatron. \n\"None taken,\" Renfrow laughed. \"Mike is an unbelievable talent. I don't think it's a stretch to say things might have been different\" against Alabama. \nThe obvious next question is: What about now? \nWhat about Clemson adding a player who one scout told Bleacher Report \"might go as high as top five or seven\" in this year's NFL draft if he comes out? A player the scout said he would be \"shocked\" to see on the board after the 10th pick? \nA player who is a matchup nightmare for any defense, much less an Alabama secondary that, when spread out and forced to cover in man, gives ground in individual battles? \nA player who used this past spring and summer to gain weight and increase his speed and explosive ability out of breaks and off the line of scrimmage, and to refine his ability to high-point the ball and make critical catches look easy? 2017 NFL Draft WR rankings:1) Mike Williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T11:12:42.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
