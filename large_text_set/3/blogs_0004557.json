Book Sky Sports Box Office event here \nA social media post revealed that Haye had visited Dr Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, the surgeon who operated on his shoulder in 2013, but the heavyweight has laughed off suggestions about a new injury scuppering Saturday's fight against Tony Bellew. \n\"I popped over to Germany to see my doctor, something I should have done years ago, just for check-ups,\" Haye told Sky Sports at Wednesday's open workouts. I've sent a few red herrings through different people and it's definitely got back to Dave Coldwell and Tony Bellew. David Haye \n\"He's given me the thumbs up, he said I'm better than I've ever been. He said I'm ready to go. The shoulder is better now than before I had the injury. \n\"I've sent a few red herrings through different people and it's definitely got back to Dave Coldwell and Tony Bellew. David Haye works out \n\"When we did the face-to-face, they said: 'We know about your shoulder!' He got the memo I sent. \n\"I feel like the old me. I've had fights where I haven't been myself, but I stand here super-healthy and super-fast and fit. Tony Bellew works out \n\"A lot of the unknowns surrounding me are flashing up in people's minds - I haven't been in the ring in a competitive fight in five years, and that rings bells. In the time I've been out, he's had 12 or 13 fights. \n\"But this is the unveiling of the Hayemaker 2.0. My first two comeback fights were getting into the groove, now I feel ready to make an assault on the heavyweight division.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:21:18.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
