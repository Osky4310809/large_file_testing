The shoe doesn’t appear to feature a Boost sole, but it’s difficult to confirm anything without better imagery and information. As with previous drops from Pharrell and adidas, the Human Race plays out heavily on the sole insert. Pharrell’s signature branding is also featured on the heel.\nHead over to Highsnobiety’s curated shopping channel What Drops Now to shop our favorite releases. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:35:06.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
