The Alpha Chi Omega and Tau Kappa Epsilon army fight for their THON children Emeling Navas \nMembers of Alpha Chi Omega fight 'THON' strong for their Four Diamonds families. \nSporting forest green muscle T-shirts, Alpha Chi Omega and Tau Kappa Epsilon are fighting ‘army strong’ for Ashley, Amber, Clay and Nadine, their THON children. \nAlthough Hanna Beckman (senior- public relations and psychology), Anna Coffey (senior- public relations) and Kristin Bugoni (senior-biobehavioral health) dance for all their THON children, they are especially ‘army strong’ for Ashley who has relapsed. \n“We’re fighting for her,\" Bugoni said. \"We’re her army.” \nThe sisters are also dancing in support of Tally Sepot, an Alpha Chi Omega sister who died in a canning accident in the fall 2015 semester. \nThe sorority recently received a new THON child, Amber, whom they will meet Sunday afternoon for the first time. \nBeckman said that although this is her last year of THON as a student she plans to come back to support the organization after she graduates. \nThe sisters have also built a special relationship with Clay, their 14-year-old THON child, attending birthday parties and playing baseball with him. \n“I love to see how happy the kids are when they are on the floor when they're interacting with us. Hearing the parents' stories of children they've lost reinforces the idea of how important this is,” Coffey said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:42:23.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
