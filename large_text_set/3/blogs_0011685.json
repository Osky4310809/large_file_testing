The launch event poster of the Galaxy S8 was leaked earlier today. Now, stock wallpapers of the upcoming flagship smartphones have surfaced online. \nWe’re not sure if these are actual wallpapers from the S8, so keep in mind that these could be fake. They are also only 1440×2560 pixels in resolution, and going by everything we have seen until now, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are likely to feature a slightly larger display resolution, thanks to the longer displays on-board. In any case, this is all we have at this point, so go ahead and download the images below. \nLet us know what you think of these wallpapers. Don’t forget, you can download stock wallpapers of other Samsung devices from our new Wallpaper Archive .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T09:51:18.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
