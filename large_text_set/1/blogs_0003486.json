The cow also died. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe crash happened at Lwengo along the Masaka-Kampala highway on a stretch of road known locally as the most dangerous in Uganda. \n“The accident took place when a speeding omnibus taxi avoided hitting a cow that was crossing the road, (and) rammed into a bus and a truck,” said Birungi. \n“The vehicles crashed into each other, subsequently killing and injuring people. \n“And the cow was not spared,” he added. \nMore than 200 people had already been killed on the 130km (80 mile) stretch of road from January to September 2016, another traffic police officer, Edith Nanteza had said last year.
