We felt pretty good about our race car in race trim. We didn’t spend a lot of time in qualifying trim.” \nShowing speed throughout the session, Newman qualified second with a lap of 189.870 mph. Kyle Busch, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Brad Keselowski rounded out the top five. \nIt was a stressful time for a number of teams who were in a race against the clock as Friday evening’s qualifying session got underway. \nUnder NASCAR’s new inspection policy, if a car fails any part of the inspection process, they have to go through the entire process again until it’s within the rules. \nBut eventually, all 39 teams made it through inspection in time to make their qualifying runs. \nHarvick’s car spent extra time in the inspection line, but that wasn’t even a concern for him. \n“I just drive, I don’t worry about the rules,” Harvick said. “That’s not my department.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:17:47.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
