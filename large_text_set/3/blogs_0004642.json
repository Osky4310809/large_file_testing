You get constant reminders…the kids, the job itself.” This day, 2 years ago @PhillyPolice Officer Robert Wilson lost his life protecting this city. Today fellow officers pay tribute – @CBSPhilly pic.twitter.com/sR5qJmvrPv \n— Alexandria Hoff (@AlexandriaHoff) March 4, 2017 \nStevenson says his partner of over two years made a big impact on his life: \n“Rob’s last conversation was about life, and what we were going to do in the future, and he didn’t have a chance to fulfill that, I had that chance, so take everything more seriously and more personally.” \nAlso at the vigil were Officer Wilson’s family. His grandmother, Constance Wilson, couldn’t help but smile as she reminisced about her grandson during this somber event. \n“Charming he was,” she says. “I mean he was a lot of fun, always liked to have him around. When he wasn’t at the house you missed him. He was always looking after us and we miss him.” \nAnd she hasn’t stopped missing him since his death in March of 2015. \n“Every morning I get up, you know, I think about him. I think about him all day because I got pictures of him all over the house, so it hurts.” \nThe vigil ended with balloons released into the sky…one balloon for each person on hand.
