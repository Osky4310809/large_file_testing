By: FE Online | Published: February 23, 2017 5:13 PM “Their customers at the bottom end may not create a lot of stickiness because they are not really data users and the game going forward is all about data,” Bharti Airtel’s former CEO Sanjay Kapoor said to ET Now. \nBharti Airtel ’s proposed acquisition of rival Telenor India will benefit it more in terms of getting hold of 4G radio bandwidth rather than adding to its subscriber base, Airtel’s former CEO and consultant Sanjay Kapoor said on Thursday in an interview to ET Now. \n“Their customers at the bottom end may not create a lot of stickiness because they are not really data users and the game going forward is all about data,” Kapoor said to ET Now. \nEarlier today, Bharti Airtel – India’s largest telecom services operator for now – said that it will acquire Telenor India to further augment its customer base and network, amid the ongoing consolidation in the Indian telecom sector after the entry of Reliance Jio with its free voice and data services. \nThe acquisition will add Telenor’s about 44 million subscribers to Bharti Airtel’s existing 266 million mobile users in India, taking the total to about 310 million, and will give it another 43.4 MHz spectrum in the precious 1800 MHz band, which could be used to offer the highly sought after 4G services. Bharti Airtel and other telecom service operators in India have been rolling out and expanding their 4G offerings on the 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz spectrum. \n“We all know that larger blocks of telecom are more potent and effective than smaller blocks of spectrum. So if that is true then spectrum is one of the reasons because Telenor has the better 1800 megahertz spectrum with it,” Kapoor said. “Spectrum is a very important raw material and this industry, which is exceedingly spectrum hungry, needs to be consolidated,” he added.

Telenor India operates in seven circles (service areas) with high population concentration, namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP (East), UP (West) and Assam, which too could boost growth prospects for Bharti Airtel, which is now looking for the next wave of customers from the under-served hinterland. \nIndian telecom sector is seeing major consolidation moves with almost all the telecom service companies in India considering joining hands with one another, as the incumbents look for scale and operational efficiency to take on the onslaught of competition from the giant new entrant Reliance Jio. \nVodafone India – the second-largest telecom operator – is in talks for an all-share merger with Idea Cellular – the third largest – in order to gain the required scale to take on the heightened competition. An announcement to this effect is expected later this week. \nOn the other hand, Tata Teleservices is reportedly in talks with Reliance Communications to merge its operations with the Anil Ambani group-controlled entity to join the proposed R-Comm-Aircel-MTS combine. As is known, Reliance Communications is all set to finalise deals to merge Aircel Ltd into its own wireless telephony business. It is also in the process of finalising a merger of Systema Shyam Teleservices, the owner of MTS services, with itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:48:30.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
