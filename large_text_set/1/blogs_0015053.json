This listing popped up on DirectD website, which is a site of a Malaysian retailer. The phone is priced at RM 1,799 ($402) in Malaysia, and Malaysian consumers can now pre-order the phone, even though Vivo did not officially announce it just yet. \nAccording to the source, the Vivo V5 Plus will be somewhat more powerful than the Vivo V5 which was introduced back in November, and the two phones look very similar, though the Vivo V5 Plus comes with a larger display. The Vivo V5 Plus will feature a 5.5-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) In-Cell display with a 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection, according to the source. The device will pack in 4GB of RAM and 64GB of native storage, while you’ll also be able to find two SIM card slots inside of this phone (2 x nano SIM). Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 625 64-bit octa-core SoC is clocked at 2GHz and it fuels this smartphone, along with the Adreno 506 GPU. The 16-megapixel snapper (f/2.0 aperture, PDAF) will be placed on the back of the Vivo V5 Plus, while there are two cameras up front, a 20-megapixel (Sony’s IMX376 sensor, f/2.0 aperture, 5p lens) and 8-megapixel shooters. The so-called Moonlight Flash is also placed on the front side of the Vivo V5 Plus if the source is to be believed. \nThe 3,160mAh battery will make sure the Vivo V5 Plus doesn’t run out of juice ahead of time, while fast charging will also be included. A fingerprint scanner is placed on the front side of the device, the device’s home button actually serves as a fingerprint scanner. Android 6.0 Marshmallow will come pre-installed on the device with Vivo’s Funtouch OS 3.0 skin, and a 3,5mm headphone jack is located on the top of this smartphone. The Vivo V5 Plus is available in Gold color variant from DirectD, and as already mentioned, it costs RM 1,799 ($402) in Malaysia, but we do not know how much will it cost once it lands in India on January 23rd .
