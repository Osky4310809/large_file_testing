Betsy DeVos on Jan. 17, 2017. (Photo: Erik Lesser, epa) 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIn an historic squeaker, Betsy DeVos just won approval as our education secretary. Now, everyone is braced for what they assume is coming next: Traditional school districts get starved while school choice options flourish. \nActually, just the opposite is likely to play out. \nDeVos presents no threat to traditional schools, especially those beloved suburban schools that parents seek out. But she does present a threat to public charter schools, which have proven to be the first-ever school reform that works at scale for poor kids. \nAllow me to explain. \nEven if DeVos wanted to undermine traditional public schools (which I doubt she does) she lacks the authority. The new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act , is pretty much tamper-proof. Stripping power from any secretary of education was a key feature of the bill. \nVoucherize the $15 billion in federal Title 1 money that targets poor kids? Not doable by executive order. \nThe real reason not to worry comes down to politics. Does anyone really believe that Republican politicians who represent most of those suburban parents are going to lay a hand on their schools? Not a chance. \nSuperintendents everywhere donâ€™t want it see radical reforms. If you represent a red state like Texas those school chiefs, especially in rural areas, are demi-gods. Crossing them could get you yanked back from Washington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:06:49.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
