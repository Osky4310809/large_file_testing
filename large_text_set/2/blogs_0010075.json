Before you get into the spanking itself, Thomas-Hall advises pregaming with some serous eye gazing and breathing exercises. Thomas-Hall believes these practices help bond the spankee with the spanker. But that’s not the only thing that makes it Zen: While BDSM is largely about power dynamics—with the top partner controlling the bottom—the opposite is true for Zen spanking, where the top is supposed to do what the bottom says. \nSo far, so good. We can get behind that. But when the action comes to a close, there’s still some work to be done—and here’s where Thomas-Hall loses us. During the last period of Zen spanking, called “aftercare,” the top partner should hold the bottom like a baby while they reflect on what just went down. It’s supposed to be a sweet end to a spanking good time . . . but bringing the whole baby thing into it just weirds us out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:54:08.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
