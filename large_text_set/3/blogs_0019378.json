Dunkin' is also testing out a few new items that could get a national release this year. \nHere are eight new items from the company to taste this spring: SHARES 47 Mins Ago Frozen Dunkin' Coffee \nJust in time for summer, Dunkin is slated to roll out Frozen Dunkin' Coffee in the next few months. The beverage is reminiscent of the company's Coffee Coolatta, but packs more coffee taste in each sip. \n\"Our Coffee Coolatta isn't good enough,\" Fuqua said. \"This product is way better.\" \nFrozen Dunkin' Coffee is made with Dunkin' coffee extract, blended with ice, liquid cane sugar and dairy. Customers can customize the drink in any way they want, adding additional flavors or picking a different dairy mixer. \n\"You just can't have it black,\" Molly Zimmerman, senior research and development technologist at Dunkin', said. It took Zimmerman four years to bring frozen coffee to fruition.

Nitro Coffee, which was popularized by rival Starbucks , is currently being testing in five restaurants in Boston and Rhode Island, but will likely be headed to national menus soon. \nThe beverage, which is infused with Nitrogen, is a bold and creamy drink that will be poured from a tap in-restaurant.

Starting at the end of March, the company will be selling Monster Energy–infused Strawberry and Blue Raspberry Coolattas. Each drink contains one full can of Monster Energy. \nThe beverage is a \"secret menu item\" loved by staff and customers alike, the culinary team said. Dunkin' Energy Punch is currently available in select markets in the Northeast, West Palm Beach, Florida, and Miami.

The beverage can be customized using any of Dunkin's signature flavors including hazelnut, vanilla and mocha.

The company's culinary team suggests you pair it with Dunkin's Butter Pecan Coffee for the perfect mix of savory and sweet.

At the end of the month, customers will be able to get their hands on the Peanut Butter Delight Croissant Donut. \nThe pastry is a regular glazed croissant doughnut filled with peanut butter buttercream and topped with chocolate icing.
