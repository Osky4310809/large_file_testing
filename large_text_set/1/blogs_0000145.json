At PSG it was amazing, and I came to United and my first six months here have been more than amazing. \n\"I'm super-happy and I feel good. I don't know how many years I have left, but I'm enjoying the football. Every year, they [United] have been calling me and they were not feeling good, so I wanted to come when everyone thought I was over [the hill].\" \nIbrahimovic has the opportunity to add to his tally when United travel to West Ham on Monday.
