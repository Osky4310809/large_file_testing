I knew I was going around the (bullwheel) and then I was backwards and all of the sudden I was blacking out.” \nThe harrowing rescue was recounted to The Denver Post on Thursday by rescuer Mickey Wilson , the man’s friend and a professional slackliner, and confirmed by the resort, which says it is reviewing the incident that occurred about 11 a.m. on the Lenawee Mountain Lift. \nParts of the rescue were captured on video and in still photos. \nApp users: Click here to watch the video Photo provided by Mickey Wilson Mickey Wilson, left, is shown shimming down a lift line to rescue a friend of a friend who was caught in an Arapahoe Basin chairlift chair by his straps and hanging unconscious from his neck Wednesday, Jan 4, 2017. \n“It was one of the most scary things I’ve ever seen, honestly,” Wilson said in an interview. “Just seeing a person get the life sucked out of them. I kind of stopped thinking and just started acting.” \nArapahoe Basin says the tangled man was taken by ambulance to St. Anthony Summit Medical Center and was then transferred to St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood. \nThe man said he escaped the ordeal with little more than a broken rib apparently suffered when he was cut down from the chair after dangling for about five minutes. He said he was evaluated for a traumatic brain injury as well, but was cleared. He agreed to speak to The Denver Post only if his name was not used because he is concerned about his privacy. \n“They put a breathing tube down me pretty quickly,” he recounted Thursday. “I was pretty much unconscious until 6:30 p.m.” \nThe resort says the man was trying to unload from the three-person lift when his backpack — filled with food, water and climbing skins — got caught. The man, still dangling from the chair, was swept around the bullwheel at the top of the lift and back down the mountain, at which point the operator shut down the ride. \nWilson, a part-time A-Basin ski instructor, says he was on a chair behind the man, whom he described as a friend of a friend. \n“Because he was on the outside of the chairlift, he went around the emergency chairlift shutoff (trigger),” said Wilson, 28. “He was not only caught, he was literally being hung by his neck by his backpack. He was hanging 3 feet, 4 feet below the chair. His feet were maybe only about 10 feet off the snow.” \nWilson, who lives in Golden, said he and a few bystanders first tried to create a human pyramid to reach the man, but the group kept tumbling down. \n“That’s when I realized — it all kind of snapped together — that ‘I can climb this tower and get to him,’ ” said Wilson, who competes all over the world in slackline contests and has won Red Bull events. \nWilson says he reached the unconscious man in about four or five minutes. Ski patrollers quickly arrived with a ladder, but upon seeing Wilson, “perfectly tossed me the knife.” \nThe man fell 10 to 15 feet after Wilson cut the straps, the drop of his motionless body captured in a video, with people in the background screaming “Cut him loose!” \nWilson said bystanders were yelling at him not to climb the lift’s ladder, but “I didn’t listen to them.” \nHe said his slacklining experience made the rescue possible. “The only way I was able to get to him so fast was to climb the tower and shimmy down the line to him so fast.” \nWilsons said there wasn’t much the resort could have done to prevent the accident. “Arapahoe Basin did an amazing job of responding to this incident,” Wilson said by phone Thursday as he was driving up for a day of powder skiing at A-Basin. \nWilson says he ended up on the mountain with the man by chance. He was planning to ski alone Wednesday but ran into some pals at the base, leading to them riding together in a group. \n“I was lucky Mickey was there,” the injured skier said. “I’m alive. I get to go ski again someday.” \nThe accident is being investigated by the resort and the U.S. Forest Service, as well as by the Colorado Passenger Tramway Safety Board. \n“The lift is open to the public. It did not malfunction,” said A-Basin spokeswoman Adrienne Saia Isaac, adding, “We’re extending our best wishes to the guest for a quick recovery.” \nA similar incident occurred Monday at Sundance Mountain Resort in Utah, where The Associated Press reported a boy was caught on a lift by his backpack. The child kicked off his skis and threw his poles away as two lift operators propped up a ladder , with one climbing to the chair and pulling the boy to safety. \nThe boy, who was rescued in about seven minutes, was OK. It was the second time in the last three weeks that a kid had become stuck on a lift by a backpack at Sundance, according to The Associated Press. \nIn Colorado last week, a 40-year-old Texas mother died when she and her two young daughters fell about 25 feet from a chairlift at Ski Granby Ranch in Grand County. That incident remains under investigation. Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:02:37.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
