The promoter, whose ticket packages ran from $75 to $5,000 each, said the party was celeb-free due to a bomb threat a few blocks away.\nSources connected to the venue tell us the promoter simply didn't come up with enough scratch to pay the celebs and vendors for the event. Other sources -- close to Snoop, Future and Flo Rida -- tell us they never inked a deal because they never got paid, so they never planned to attend.\nThere really was a bomb threat, but we're told it played no part in the no-shows. \nFloyd did promote the party on social media, but bailed as well. His camp hasn't gotten back to us on whether he got paid.\nAt least in this case ...
