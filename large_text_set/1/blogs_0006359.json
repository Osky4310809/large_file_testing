The first period featured a lot of back-and-forth action, with both teams having multiple scoring chances. The Bâ€™s narrowly edged the Panthers in shots in the period at 13-11. Each team had a pair of power-play opportunities but neither were able to find the back of the net. After a stretch of poor starts in recent games, the Bâ€™s were finally able to get on the board first thanks to a Brad Marchand short-handed goal. \nâ€” Boston Bruins (@NHLBruins) January 8, 2017 \nBRUINS OFFENSE COMES ALIVE The second period was all Bruins. After missing the previous three games due to a concussion, David Backes found the back of the net just over four minutes into the period to give the Bâ€™s a 2-0 lead.

A large part of the Bruins offensive success through the first two periods was their domination in the face-off circle, winning 60 percent of the battles. Rask continued to be solid in net, saving all 19 Panther shot attempts through the first two periods. \nBOSTON SHUTS THE DOOR The third period was equally dominant for the Bruins. Already with a comfortable 3-0 lead, the Bâ€™s added some insurance five minutes into the period via a Riley Nash goal, his second of the season. Boston controlled the puck for the majority of the third period, which was in large part due to their three power-play opportunities. The Bâ€™s domination of puck possession allowed Florida to only get off six shots in the period, which were all denied by Rask. \nUP NEXT The Bruins will be on short rest when they hit the ice in Raleigh to take on the Carolina Hurricanes on Sunday night. Puck drop is set for 5 p.m. ET. \nThumbnail photo via Steve Mitchell/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T14:09:37.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
