New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: The R9 290 -> 290X Unlock Thread WARNING: FLASH AT YOUR OWN RISK Hawaii Info is in the Download Section of the Guide Please read this post first before posting questions about your graphics card (if it unlocks, how to unlock, etc.). There have been a few incidents of having an unstable card after unlocking to a 290x, so tread carefully. If you're just receiving a new 290, hoping to unlock it shortly afterwards, please play around with the card for a couple days so you know how it behaves. Afterwards, you can try flashing. If you notice any symptoms that didn't occur with the stock BIOS, like having lower fps/scores in whatever you're playing/benching, you're unstable, etc., immediately flash the default bios back. Some people have also had more stability and unlock success using a 290x bios matching their AIB 290 card (i.e. Sapphire 290x bios on Sapphire 290). So, if you're experiencing stability issues, and/or your card won't unlock, you may want to try that out if the Asus 290x/PT1/PT3/etc. bios doesn't work right for you. Also , if you're having problems with the drivers installing even though you have an unlockable card, check Techpowerup's BIOS database to find a bios that matches the default bios version on your card (i.e. 015.44.000.007. - use GPU-Z to find your bios version). Just a heads up for everyone, I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk about mining in this thread. There are other threads more appropriate for that topic. Thanks The following threads are more suitable for mining discussion: 3. Checking if your card is Unlockable (Click to show) Run Hawaii Info. If the numbers don't look like either one of these, then your card is locked. Any results other than the results below means your card is locked. Your Hawaii Info results HAS to match either one of these in order for your card to be unlocked to a 290X. More info on Hawaii Info HERE . Code: RA1: F8 5 RA2: F8010000 RB1: F8 5 RB2: F8010000 RC1: F8 5 RC2: F8010000 RD1: F8 5 RD2: F8010000 Code: Extract all of the files Open up the Windows 98 Archive you downloaded and extract it to a folder. Open up the HP Format tool. Make sure you select the drive you want to make bootable, and that FAT32 is checked. Check the \"Create DOS Startup Disk box, and link it to your extracted windows 98 folder. Format the drive. It should be bootable now. 5. Preparing your USB Drive for Flashing (Click to show) Copy ATIFlash.exe to the root directory of your USB Drive. Drag your 290X ROM on the root directory as well. To avoid the Windows 8.3 filename with other roms you might use (i.e. asusflas~1.rom), shorten the name of the rom to like 7 characters. Now, your drive is set up. 6. Preparing your 290 for Flashing (Click to show) Turn off your computer, and switch the BIOS selector on your R9 290 so that it's closest to the power connectors. That's the Uber position (the 290 doesn't have an Uber BIOS, both switch positions are copies of the 290 Quiet BIOS). The Quiet switch position is the one closest to your video connections. Take out all other PCI devices, including multiple R9 290s. We're flashing them one at a time so that if your card bricks up or doesn't respond like it should to the flash, you still have another good card to use. Boot from your USB drive. You shoud get a CLI. Type DIR to verify that ATIFlash and your ROM are on the drive. Use this command to flash: atiflash.exe -f -p 0 romname.rom The flashing process should take around 10sec. Rinse and repeat for any other 290s that you have that you would like to flash (turn off computer, swap out cards, and repeat the process, making sure you have the card on the Uber switch position). When you restart your computer, you may have a low resolution desktop. This is fine. Wait for the drivers to reinstall on your card, and restart the computer again. Open up GPU-Z to see if there are any changes to your shaders and clock speed. To confirm that you successfully flashed your card, run some benchmarks and compare it to your original score. Putting the stock ROM back on (Click to show) If you found out you were unsuccessful in your flash, or you just want to flash it back, here's how you do it. Take your backed-up ROM that you did in Step 1, and transfer it to your bootable USB drive. Turn off your computer, and make sure your 290's switch is in the Uber position. Again, remove any other PCI devices, including multiple 290s. Turn on your computer, and flash the stock rom using this command: atiflash.exe -f -p 0 romname.rom Yup, it's the same one as before. Reboot your computer, and after the drivers reinstall, you should have a completely stock card again! Put the stock rom on your bootable USB drive. Get a spare card, and throw it in the primary PCIe slot in your computer. Put your 290 in another slot, with it switched to the faulty bios. Put your video cables on your backup card and boot from your USB drive Type this in: atiflash.exe -i This will show you what adapter number your card is. It should say Hawaii, along with the card you're using to boot. Whatever your adapter number is, remember it because you'll need it for the following command Now, type in atiflash.exe -f -p x stockrom.rom x will be the adapter number of your card. Give it about 5sec. reboot your computer, switch your 290 back to primary, and you should be good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:17:11.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
