Two days ago we heard that Chelsea are already planning a summer shopping spree (with Costa’s future far from assured), yesterday we heard that Costa might already have an agreement with a Chinese club (which he then firmly denied on Instagram), so now here comes the Álvaro Morata rumor, and not for the first time either.

Chelsea steal a march on Arsenal as Alvaro Morata tells friends he expects Stamford Bridge move @Matt_Law_DT https://t.co/TjPXSNFIMO — Telegraph Football (@TeleFootball) February 3, 2017 Rumors like these often make you wonder just who these chatterbox “friends” are and whether they actually mean nosey agents or other troublemakers. Morata returned to Real this summer from Juventus with the firm intent of displacing Karim Benzema as first choice striker, but while he’s been more successfully at it than, say Michy Batshuayi has been at getting minutes over Costa, he remains the firm second-choice. Morata did recently debunk rumors of leaving Real Madrid , but that’s not something the rumor mill is likely to take too seriously. The biggest trouble with Morata, especially for whatever outrageous price we’d have to pay for him, is that he’s not Romelu Lukaku. Discuss.
