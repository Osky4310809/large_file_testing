But the children who never had a chance at life become so-called medical waste or, alternatively, a commodity to be bartered for.” \nTexas kicked Planned Parenthood out of its Medicaid program Dec. 20, saying the Project Veritas videos were proof of misconduct by the organization for violating state and federal laws regarding abortions. Planned Parenthood sued to block the cut, and Sparks ordered a hearing for mid-January. Tuesday’s ruling was the result of testimony heard in that hearing. \nIn his ruling Tuesday, Sparks said the state had failed to produce evidence that Planned Parenthood had broken federal or state laws, Medicaid provisions, or even medical or ethical standards.
