Could   \nI’ve packed my overnight bag for the trip to Sevilla, I wonder whether Claudio Ranieri will be packing a bit more. \nThe Leicester boss recently received assurances over his future but things have got a lot worse since then. There is no chance that any sensible owner will allow the drift to continue. Even the supportive Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. Ultimately it is too costly. \nRanieri's only win in normal time in 2017 came in the FA Cup against Everton. That's one win in 10, losing the last five in the Premier League. Last year's champions have lost to Burnley, Swansea and now Millwall since New Year’s Eve. \nLets not sugar coat it. Leicester have been awful. \nThey have the fourth-worst attack, the second-worst away form, they are bottom of the form table, and that Jamie Vardy look-a-like seems to have been given the nod ahead of their star striker. Jamie Vardy has been unrecognisable for Leicester this season (Photo: Plumb Images) Leicester's players jetted to Spain on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League game against Sevilla (Photo: Plumb Images) Danny Drinkwater shone last term but hasn't had the same influence this time around (Photo: Plumb Images) \nStatistically they are the worst champions since Manchester City in 1936/37 who were relegated the very next year. If they keep playing like this, Leicester will be relegated. \nThe heart has gone. The indomitable spirit evaporated. For a team that has such huge characters in Kasper Schmeichel, Wes Morgan and Robert Huth, they look leaderless. They went above and beyond last year but they’ve gone below and nowhere near the standards required this. \nThey are not the only overachievers who have subsequently come down to earth with an almighty bang. \nHerfloge BK won the Danish title in 1999/2000 and were relegated the very next year. This though, is a club that have spent most of their life in the regional leagues and funds in the Danish division are minuscule.

The league, football, the country was finding its feet. \nJuventus and Milan have been relegated after winning titles but those situations were related to scandal. \nIn real terms Leicester’s demise is as unprecedented as their rise. \nSo should Ranieri take the blame? He has to take some of it. \nAs Premier League champions, Leicester were rewarded greatly. They received £93 million from the Premier League alone. Ranieri must take some of the blame for Leicester's demise (Photo: Plumb Images) Their title success last season was the stuff of dreams... (Photo: Getty Images) ... but the defence of their crown has been dismal (Photo: Getty) \nCoupled with the £71.6 million received the year before, and their Champions League money they could have bought Paul Pogba twice. \nIf he isn't solely in charge of recruitment Ranieri will at least have had a say. That reflects badly, as does the animosity brewing in the dressing room and the cooling of relationships with certain players. \nThe finger will be pointed at the squad but it is the manager’s job to keep everyone together. As Ranieri did so admirably last season, and let's face it when it comes to the crunch who carries the can nine times out of 10? \nDespite their admirable and principled statement the Thai owners aren't going to fire £200-300 million worth of talent. Ranieri will be canned if he doesn't transform Leicester's fortunes soon (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha will soon run out of patience with the Foxes' Italian manager (Photo: REX) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:33:46.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
