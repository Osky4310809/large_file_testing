The ending that made it into the revival years after the original series aired was always intended to be a cliffhanger, but now it looks like we may actually get to find out what happens after those final four words are spoken.\nAt least, that’s how Netflix’s Ted Sarandos tells it in comments he made over the weekend , saying that the savior of TV shows past is, indeed, in “very preliminary” talks with Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, on the subject of making more episodes. We still don’t know if the Gilmore Girls Twitter account really knew that something was up when they previously taunted fans with what was taken as a hint at future episodes, but The Truth Is Out There.\nIn such early talks, it’s more than possible that those directly involved don’t have any better of an idea than we do, right now, of whether or not more Gilmore Girls will actually come together, with everyone now moved on to different projects. However, Sarandos mentioned that fan enthusiasm was encouraging to Netflix, and though the company’s reluctance to release viewer numbers makes it difficult to know for sure, it certainly seems like the response to the revival was enough to warrant putting some effort into getting everyone back together again.\n(via THR , image via Netflix)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
