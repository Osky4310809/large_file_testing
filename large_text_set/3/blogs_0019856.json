Yesterday, we got a sneak peek of the new product from an unexpected source: Kattan's husband. Christopher Goncalo, who is lovingly known as a silver fox, posted an Instagram picture of himself with the Dubai-based beauty mogul in full lab attire. In the caption, he wrote, \"I am taking full creditðŸ’¯ for the new #hudabeautypalette coming soon.\" As for what the palette will entail, we aren't entirely sure. The adorable couple selfie didn't give any clues. Goncalo later took to another social media platform to drop some more hints. On his Snapchat story, he posted a black-and-white photo of Kattan with the words, \"Prettiest chemist I've ever seen.\" If you look closely at her forearm, you can see multiple swatches. We're guessing it's another eyeshadow palette. Sadly, the filter is making it hard to tell what the color theme will be, but the swatches definitely look dark.

(We're still swooning over some of the pinks and golds.) Maybe the new Huda Beauty palette will include more neutral shades or be geared toward creating the perfect Huda-inspired smoky eye look. We'll have to keep tuning into Huda's husband's Snapchat stories for more sneak peeks. Hopefully, Kattan herself will give us more info on her own social media soon. If that happens, we'll be sure to keep you updated. Loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:45:37.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
