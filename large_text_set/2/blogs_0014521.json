That’s why Billy Flynn Gadbois from Boston knows that the most important thing in a break-up is holding on to certain values for his children. \nBilly recently uploaded an open letter on his Facebook to explain why he went over to his ex-wife’s place on her birthday to give her flowers and cook her breakfast with his children. 2 \nIt reads: \n“It’s my ex-wife’s birthday today so I got up early and brought flowers and cards and a gift over for the kids to give her and helped them make her breakfast. \nPer usual someone asked me why the hell I still do things for her all the time. This annoys me. So ima break it down for you all. \nI’m raising two little men. The example I set for how I treat their mum is going to significantly shape how they see and treat women and affect their perception of relationships. I think even more so in my case because we are divorced. \nSo if you aren’t modelling good relationship behaviour for your kids, get your shit together. Rise above it and be an example. This is bigger than you. \nRaise good men. Raise strong women. Please. The world needs them, now more than ever.” 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:55:49.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
