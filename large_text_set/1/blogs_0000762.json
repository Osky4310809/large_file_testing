You spend weeks crafting the design, sourcing the wood, measuring cuts, and finally building it. But then you figure that the final sanding will take too much time and that your customer won’t notice if you skip that step. But they will. \nThere’s a huge difference between an unfinished table and a carefully crafted and polished piece of furniture. It’s the difference between a raw image and an edited, well-thought out Instagram post. \nIf a picture is worth a thousand words, than an unedited Instagram post might as well be a jumbled alphabet.
