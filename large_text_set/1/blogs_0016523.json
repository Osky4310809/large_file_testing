Not only is her voice unique and strong, but her songs are classic: \"Sweet Love,\" \"Good Love,\" \"Same Ole Love\" -- whatever love you like, she's sung about it in an epic way. And while I wasn't waiting by my streaming service with my fingers crossed for new music from the Toledo, Ohio native, the idea that it actually may not be coming at all is a bit sad. <img src=\"http://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Anita-Baker-PF.jpg\" alt=\"Anita Baker \" width=\"1068\" height=\"601\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782727\" /> While spending her time soaking in the sun at the beach, Baker addressed alleged rumors that she might be putting out new music. According to <em><a href=\"http://singersroom.com/content/2017-01-16/aw-man-anita-baker-hangs-up-the-mic-confirms-retirement-on-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">Singersroom</a></em>, Baker hasn't released anything since 2012's <a href=\"http://madamenoire.com/204145/who-did-it-better-anita-baker-remakes-lately/\">cover of Tyrese's \"Lately\"</a> and a track called \"Sweetest Dreams.\" Both were supposed to be featured on an album called <em>Only Forever </em>that never came to be. In response to questions about future projects, Baker pretty much told fans not to hold their breath in several Twitter posts: <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Lotta rumours out there.

You're a singer, man! You need to sing!'\" And here she is, now set on the idea of hanging up the mic. But can you blame her? There is nothing more alluring than some sun and sand after years of working and working hard (she's been making music since the late '70s by the way). At least we'll always have the classics...   <em>Image via WENN </em>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:31:13.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
