And that’s what I really want to talk about. 10 \nAnd I’m proud of how Team Murray conducted themselves at the tournament. It’s a celebrity pro-am and, without naming names, a lot of celebrities don’t interact with the fans, the people who make their careers. \nWhen we started William Murray Golf Bill said we would abide by the rules of Arnold Palmer: “I was playing with (Arnold) once and he was grinding, getting ready for the senior tour. After the round, Arnie signed autographs for 3 hours straight, I’d never seen anything like it. He had to sit down in a chair at some point but he kept going. I knew if Arnie could do it at that age, I can do it.” Advertisement Advertisement 11 \nTo that end, Pat Perez signs every autograph. He’s often late for dinner with his lovely wife, Ashley (sorry!) but he signs them all. Pat finished in 14th place at Pebble and is currently the #3 ranked player in the world. He’s having the best season in his amazing 19-year career with WMG. 12 \nAnd the biggest celebrity out there? He signs ’em all too. While most celebrities consider themselves ‘inside the ropes’ Bill walks the fairways outside the ropes so he can interact with the fans, maybe give them a moment they will never forget. He’s always willing to have a beer (and a laugh) with them. “Because that,” as Bill says, “Is when you know you’re really living.” \nThat’s not only William Murray Golf, that’s the core ethos of theCHIVE. Just like Mr. Palmer, we are not better than anybody else during the round or at the end of it. We are outside of the ropes, with the people. 13 \nThen things went pear-shaped. How I broke my right leg in 10 places : \nWe were supposed to have dinner Friday night at the house Pat Perez was renting for the week. He had told me to call him when I got there and he’d come and get us. But when we arrived, the towering, 10-foot gate called to half-drunk John. It said, “You don’t need the gate code, John, you got this.” \nI climbed up over the gate despite the protestations of everybody with me in the minivan. I made it onto the top of a support beam on the other side. Easy enough, but when I jumped I felt a snag on my jeans. After that, science pretty much took the wheel. With my momentum, with the inertia of moving forward, the angular velocity built quickly and sought center mass. The fixed axis of rotation would become a space just below my kneecap and with the total generated kinetic energy focused there, my tibia exploded long before I ever impacted the ground. \nWho said it’s not the fall that kills you? 14 \nBut I was still falling fast, headfirst. This is where I truly consider myself the luckiest guy alive. I fell 10 feet onto the cement driveway and landed on my forehead. I hit so my head so hard the lenses in my sunglasses shattered out of their frames. I saw a white flash but never lost consciousness. I immediately counted backwards from 10, recited my first and last name, and the day of the week. \nThen I felt my head. Nothing but a little scratch at the top of my forehead. By all accounts I should have been Humpty Dumpty at that point – concussed at the very least, or a coma at the worst. But no way would I have just a tiny scratch? I was wearing the William Murray ZFG when I fell and I’ve been wearing it ever since, the doctors could only take it off my head for surgery. I know we advertise our clothing is ‘probably bulletproof’ but I thought we were joking? The doctors even admitted the hat may have helped. 15 \nJoel Murray and my brother Leo arrived on the scene. Before anybody moved me, Joel said, “Do you feel nauseous at all? I said I yes. Joel responded, “Ok, that’s your body telling you that something is broken, we don’t move him until we find the broken bone. Which they did and moved me accordingly, preventing further damage. Joel Murray and my brother, Leo, were on point that night. \nJoel was the first person in my hospital room the next morning. Joel is the CEO of William Murray Golf and you simply don’t have better business partners than these guys. Because they put friendship first, always. (Joel’s Instagram ).

Thanks for everything, Brother. 17 \nI loved watching the memes flow in btw. Whichever Chiver made this one deserves some kind of Olympic Medal. 18 GIF \nWe went into a grocery store to get my prescriptions filled when Leo saw a Rascal scooter. I’d never seen him so happy, “Dude we have to go down the soda aisle in case you knock a bunch of stuff over, lemme’ get my camera!” 19 \nToday, for everybody who clicked on this post we are making 100 William Murray ZFG Flexfit hats available, with portion of the proceeds to benefit Bill’s favorite charity, the Mercy Home for Boys and Girls in Chicago. This is the most sought-after hat in the world right now and I ask you please don’t sell it on eBay unless you plan on donating to the Mercy Home as well, deal? The hat is probably bulletproof, after all. \nThe ZFG is available RIGHT HERE ! 20 \nAfter Bill’s final round on Sunday, he left to try and find me at the hospital. Unable to get a hold of me, Brandon or Kerry (they were already on their flights home) Bill just started walking into the local hospitals asking for “The Fence Jumper.” One nurse was amused but wanted clarification on the name. Bill said, “Oh, I’m sorry, full name is Jumper, F. ” \nI still smile so big thinking about Bill Murray aimlessly walking around local hospitals trying to find me, entertaining everybody along the way like the merry prankster he is. When he finally did find my room, he had missed me by a couple hours, I had departed to San Francisco to hop a flight out the next day. When I arrived at my hotel I received this text from Bill: \n“There’s not always a happy ending when a sincere gaze and voice speaks the words, “He’s no longer a patient.” Advertisement Advertisement 21 \nBill’s sage-like philosophy reinforced what I already knew, that this fall could have been much worse. I landed on my head. My ending will be a happy one. I have the best friends a guy could hope for. The Murrays are old school. If somebody is hurt, they show at the hospital. Not out of a sense of obligation, though. it’s just what they do . \nAnd if I’m not there, they entertain the nurses. \nThanks to everybody who sent letters and flowers. Thanks to all the nurses and doctors at the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula for dealing with me. And thanks to Team William Murray, for making Pebble Beach this year the most fun it’s been in a long time, you kept it classy. I am humbled to be a part of all this magic. \nKCCO,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:51:06.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
