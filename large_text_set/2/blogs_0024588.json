By Nelson Pressley By Nelson Pressley February 23 at 12:00 PM Follow @nelsonpressley Brandy Norwood as Roxie Hart with Denny Paschall, left, and Michael Scirrotto in “Chicago.” (Jeremy Daniel) \n“Chicago” has been on the boards for 20 years now, but the vampy John Kander -Fred Ebb musical is not only making its Kennedy Center debut for two weeks starting April 4 — it’s also adding pop to the marquee with R&B star Brandy Norwood joining the cast as Roxie Hart, the center announced Thursday. \n“The show completely changed my life,” Norwood said by phone from Los Angeles. (Her sidekick in Washington will be Terra C. MacLeod, who has frequently taken the stand on Broadway as Velma Kelly.) \nNorwood, 38, has enjoyed star status since she was TV’s teen “ Moesha ” and the title character in the 1997 television version of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Cinderella” with Whitney Houston. Her theatrical stage debut finally came in 2015 when she took on the Broadway “Chicago” as Roxie for a run that lasted several months. She later reprised her turn in Los Angeles. \nBrandy, a star at 17 \nHer eclectic entertainment career has spanned everything from selling millions of records to scripted series and TV competitions, including a stint with her brother Ray J in the current season of the Fox TV cooking show “ My Kitchen Rules .” But as Norwood talks about venturing into “the real show business,” she sounds more like a Broadway baby than you might think. \nHow did you get started with “Chicago”? \nOne day I woke up and felt tired of being tired, and I decided to get my life together: going to the gym, changing my inner dialogue to myself, affirming I was getting ready for something big. Then “Chicago” presented itself. I was nervous. I had never done Broadway before, and I didn’t know the discipline it would take to do eight shows a week. But I was surprisingly equipped for it, and it changed me for the better. It was learning how to trust the moment and trust the work I put into it. I plan to take this with me wherever I go. \nYou’re not joining the ongoing tour; you’re just in for this D.C. stop. \nI’m good friends with the producers, and I made it clear I would love to do Roxie as long as they would have me, for the rest of my career, here and there. I would love for as many people as possible to see me in that role. I’ve already started inviting a lot of people to come. \nHad you seen “Chicago” before? \nI saw it when Usher did it. [Usher played lawyer Billy Flynn on Broadway in 2006.] That was the first time I got the itch. You have to be very brave to do Broadway or a musical. That’s the real show business. You don’t have a lot of tricks. You have to really trust it and bring your best foot forward every night. \nWhy did Roxie seem like a good fit? \nWe were in the same place at the same time with our dreams. We were both visualizing what our life could be if this, that and the third thing happened. We were doing some sort of eclipse with each other – even though she did shoot somebody. I didn’t do all that. But having my own show, what she was singing about, I was doing in my own life. \nDid you have to make adjustments getting into the Broadway routine? \nThe show was all I really focused on, to keep my voice up. I had to pick and choose where to talk, and how to talk to my daughter, sleep a lot. Sleep really brings the clarity in your voice. And just 100 percent give yourself to the moment. You can’t think ahead. All the work ahead would have scared the crap of me if I thought about it while I was singing up on the ladder. \nWatch the video of Brandy’s “Beggin’ and Pleadin’ “ \nYour video for “Beggin’ and Pleadin’ ” is influenced by the blues singer Shug Avery in “The Color Purple,” and it also feels a bit like “Chicago.” Is the Broadway take on jazz and blues a new influence for you? \nThat’s definitely a new influence for me. [She sings] “All that jazz?” Like I said, the musical changed my life, made me feel capable. It influenced me in various ways as a musician; I want to add theater to everything I do. There’s nothing like it. It’s not just about you. It’s about making everyone look good. Everything now is about competition, but theater is more about the story than about the person playing the part. \nWas getting into a musical someday on your mind during “Cinderella”? \nNot necessarily. That gave me a little taste of what it would be like, but Broadway is a completely different beast. But at same time: perfect timing, because I was really ready. I don’t know if I could have put that kind of discipline in at an earlier time. It wouldn’t have been as solid back in the day. Now I have so many dreams for Broadway. \nAre you talking about that with people? \nI’m talking about it. I have this whole thing I want to do on Broadway: I want to be the first black gal to play Annie Oakley, then I want to go on to possibly doing my own thing on Broadway with my own music. It really did something to me. \nRead more :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:29:18.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
