A fully-electric SUV with an expected range of 480 km will be for North America, Europe and Asia. \nThe coming hybrid Mustang is said to offer “V8 power and even more low end torque,” while no mention is made if the electrified iconic model will retain the Coyote V8 or indeed, a V8 at all. Meanwhile, the hybrid F-150 will be built at Ford’s Dearborn Truck Plant. \n“As more and more consumers around the world become interested in electrified vehicles, Ford is committed to being a leader in providing consumers with a broad range of electrified vehicles, services and solutions that make people’s lives better,” said Mark Fields, Ford president and CEO. \nPlans are also afoot for a $700 million (RM3.148 billion) investment towards the expansion of Ford’s Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan, in order to facilitate the building of autonomous and electric vehicles alongside the Mustang and the Lincoln Continental . This move will create 700 direct new jobs, according to Ford. \nThe $700 million investment in the Flat Rock plant comes from a previous $1.6 billion (RM7.19 billion) earmarked for a new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico; plans for that plant have since been cancelled to improve company profitability. \nAn existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico will be where the next-generation Focus will be built, and this move will make way for two new, Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where the current Focus is manufactured.
