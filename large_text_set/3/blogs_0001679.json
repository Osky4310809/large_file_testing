Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum left devastated after three Asda pregnancy tests gave her false positive results was left further enraged when the supermarket suggest she ‘treat herself to some flowers’. \nRebecca Barratt, 31, was left furious after the store’s own-brand digital devices gave her the wrong result. \nAfter discovering online that other women had experienced similar problems, she complained to the store and waited four months for a refund. \nThe Manchester Evening News reports she did eventually receive an apology but was left furious by the \"patronising\" tone of the letter.

I have no intention of ever shopping with Asda again after the way that they have handled this situation.” \nDesigner Rebecca’s Asda ordeal began in November when she took the store’s £9.50 digital test – which comes with a promise of 99 per cent accuracy – when her period was late. \nReceiving a positive result, Rebecca double checked with a First Response test, which came back negative. Left unsure, Rebecca was referred to the early pregnancy unit at Tameside Hospital where a blood test showed her hCG levels – a hormone that spikes during pregnancy – to be very low, meaning she couldn’t be pregnant. \nWhen Rebecca’s period still hadn’t arrived a week later, she did another Asda test, which came back positive. A follow-up Clear Blue test was negative.
