The FE (Future Eco) concept not only previews what its next fuel-cell vehicle could look like, but it also reveals some of the performance improvements that we can expect. \nCompared with the current system used in the Tucson Fuel Cell, the new technology is 20 percent lighter and 10 percent more efficient. The power density of the fuel cell stack has also increased by 30 percen, which will give the next-generation model a much longer driving range to around 500 miles – almost double today’s model. Portable battery packs – charged by the car’s energy output – will power passenger devices. \nRelated: Hyundai foldable electric Ioniq scooter will make your commute awesome \nJust like the Tucson Fuel Cell vehicle, the next-generation system’s only emission will be water. To emphasize this, Hyundai’s designers used inspiration from nature and water to design the FE Fuel Cell concept. The concept’s clean and calm design is meant to emphasize its non-polluting nature. \n“ Hyundai Motor has a heritage of building innovative, fuel-efficient vehicles that advance the automotive industry’s environmental progress,” stated Woong Chul Yang, Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Company. “Our FE Fuel Cell Concept is an important evolution of our pioneering hydrogen leadership, and moves us closer to our vision for a ‘Hydrogen Society’, where transportation is clean, efficient and enhances the lives of our customers.” \nHyundai’s next-generation SUV fuel cell vehicle will arrive in 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T18:55:47.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
