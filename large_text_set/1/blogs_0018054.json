It is not that we don’t want to bring players in. We do. \n“But the thing is, the players we want because we think they help us, the clubs don’t sell. It is not about money in this situation, it is the winter transfer window. \n“Clubs are saying ‘no, we have half a year to go, we cannot find another player like this, we prefer to take money in the summer than a few pounds more in the winter than whatever’. \n“So it is pretty easy. You see the situation. It’s tight, it’s close, we know that, but if the right decision is not possible in signing the right player then you cannot make the wrong transfer.” \nIbrahimovic demands respect for Rooney \nKlopp also admits that the club are finding it difficult to identify players who would improve his squad, such is the strength of depth at his disposal currently. \n“It is not as if there are 20 players out there who could make this team stronger, who are running around and are available,” he added. \n“That is the situation. That is why I say we know the situation, we are prepared to move, but for the right player. We are not the only side who can decide the outcome of that, though, are we? The selling club makes the decision too.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:20:02.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
