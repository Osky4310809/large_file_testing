Speaking about the club he admitted \"they mean a lot to my life.\" Real Madrid players celebrate Copa del Rey glory with Mourinho in 2011 (Photo: Victor Carretero/Real Madrid) \nAfter his second spell in charge, and subsequent sacking, Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge in October and again spoke about his relationship with the club. \nHe said that he would never say a bad word about a former team, but, perhaps aware of managing in the same country, left personal comments out of the press conference.
