Excerpts \nHOW do you feel, not winning the 25million prize? \nI’m a human being. I’m meant to feel a little bit bad but I’m feeling a little bit not good. But all the same, it’s a game. \nWho do you think might win the grand prize? \nI feel everyone is a winner. Whoever the winner may be, I wish the person good luck. I don’t have anyone in mind. I just see everyone as a winner. \nWhat lessons have you learnt about life when you look back at all that have transpired in the BBNaija house? \nI have learnt more about understanding and tolerance. I’ve acquired a little bit of wisdom there because nobody is perfect. Every day, we learn in life. It’s not easy to cope with different characters, and to mingle with them. So, yes, I’ve learnt so many things. \nWhat would you do differently, given another opportunity? \nI think I would actually… hmm. At first, it was a game. I brought so many acting stuffs up. So, I think I would bring lots of me in it if I’m given a second chance and I will try to prove to the viewers that this is me. \nSome people are of the opinion that kissing all the guys in the house made you ‘cheap’. What do you say to that? \nI always say this: It was actually a game plan. So, whoever I kissed, whoever I did something with was part of the game. So, nothing attached actually. I’ve never felt cheap. It wasn’t based on cheapness or anything. It was just based on strategy. I was just acting up. I feel, ‘yeah, it’s a game,’ let’s play it. I wasn’t feeling bad, I wasn’t feeling innocent, I was just feeling, ‘alright, let’s play the game’ because that was part of the plan. \nHow do you feel being tagged the most controversial housemate on the show? \nActually, my game plan was to be controversial and hilarious. So, being controversial was also part of my game plan. So, I feel good. \nTell us one uplifting thing that a family member or friend has said to you since you left the house. \nYesterday (Tuesday), I actually got comments from my friends and they were like, ‘Omo babe, you bad ooo, you get mind ooo,’‘my God, I can’t believe you went to that extent,’‘anyway, I trust you, I know what you can do.’ Crazy stuffs. \nAnd one embarrassing thing that a family member or friend has said to you since you left the house… \nOh no. No embarrassing comments because they actually know who I am and they knew what I can do. Being an actress, we can act whatever needs to be done. They actually trusted my actions and never judged me. \nWhat is the true situation with your accent; make believe too? \nOkay, first of all, I’m actually an actress. So being an actress, you’re meant to bring different characters, you’re meant to make your viewers happy and enjoy your actions. So me being in the house, I felt like I was on set with cameras all around me and everything. And really, this is how I talk. I’m not forming anything. I’m a typical Nigerian, from Anambra State. So, all the different accents and everything was just based on acting. Everything was fake. I was just trying to keep my viewers happy and enjoy watching me. So, as an actress, you need to be gifted, so I made everything up. It was part of my game plan. So, that’s it. \nYou were so excited each time it was either a kissing festival or Truth or Dare game, did you think those daring exercises were what the viewers like? \nEverything based on Big Brother was ‘be crazy’, ‘be mad’, ‘be gaga’. If you want to have sex, do it. So, I think it was part of it. And definitely, I’m sure the viewers also enjoyed it. \nDid it ever bother you how people at home would perceive you? \nActually, for every action that I displayed there, for every word that I spoke there, I ignored whatever word that people might say. I just went ahead and did everything. Everything that I had planned, I just had to display it because definitely, you want something, you ‘gotta’ do whatever it takes. \nWho was your favourite mate in the house? \nMy favourite housemate was actually Miyonse. Miyonse was this kind of innocent-looking calm chef who everybody adores and love. Don’t get it wrong. I love everybody too but definitely, there is going to be your favourite person. Miyonse was my favourite because he was this kind of understanding, calm, reserved, normal fun person to be with. \nWhat is your attachment to shredded jeans? \nOkay, I love shredded jeans so much. It brings out the personality in me. Most of my jeans are actually ripped. \nHow much has Payporte improved your wardrobe? \nPayporte, omo, no be small ooo. Payporte has been the best and would always be the best. In fact, it’s my favourite now and without Payporte, I don’t think my wardrobe will be that exclusive. And I will always use Payporte \nWould you say those clothes you got every week are enough reason to want to go back to the house? \nI don’t mind going back to the house (laughs) because oh boy, I just wish that you guys would feel it but if na because of that, Big Brother, if you dey hear me, I want to come back to the house (laughs). Payporte is the best. I would advise everybody to use Payporte. \nYou apologised for saying you didn’t know Banky W and Falz… Do you think your apologies have been accepted? \nI feel so because Banky actually replied me and he said he knew it was a game. So, he won’t actually take my words so serious. He replied me and said, ‘baby it’s okay, no problem,’ that he understood. But I think I was misunderstood because what I actually meant was that I don’t know Banky one on one, like I don’t know him personally. That was why I had to ask one of my housemate that ‘who is that?’ before they told me that it’s Banky and I said, ‘okay.’ And besides, I’m not the music kind of person. I love working 2-47, going in and out but still the same, I really do apologise. \nYou were said to have walked out of your marriage in less than a year in search of fame. Do you sometimes regret that you took that decision? \nWow, when I first heard that, I was like, ‘what the … Who would say that?’ I was never married, like everything that was said was just rumours. Definitely, I’m an actress, so most of the scenes that I have acted are marriage scenes, giving a drink to an actor, so I think that person that actually posted the picture was trying to make himself or herself famous because they would like to use my identity to make themselves famous and stuffs like that. But whoever that person is, I don’t know. It’s just rumours. \nYou answer to Ebuka on how to achieve fame and power was not properly articulated, could you tell us a more defined approach.? \nWhat I intend to actually do is just applying wisdom in everything in getting it because you can’t just stand and say you want power and fame. You ‘gotta’ work towards getting the power and fame. So, definitely, there are a lot of things involved. \nNow that you don’t seem to be getting any movie roles in Lagos, are you planning on going back to Asaba? \nActing has always been my passion. So, I have made up my mind that wherever I find myself in or wherever I am that I’m being called for a movie, definitely, I’m going to go for it. My location doesn’t matter, my base doesn’t matter. Whenever you need me, whenever you want me, I’m always there for my movies. \nHow did you feel that you were the least talented in the house, in terms of music? \nLike I said, whatever action that was displayed in the house has always been the game plan. \nSome pictures actually linked you to some men, could you tell us your relationship with Flavour and Mr. 2Kay? \nFlavour, I had no relationship with him. I never dated him. I just saw him as a talented musician and I love his songs. And Mr 2Kay is just a very good friend of mine. We were quite close. So, nothing intimate. \nTell us about some of your rough past, including being a hair dresser. \nActually, I wouldn’t want to talk about my past because that’s why it’s called past. Past is gone. And the rumour of me being a hairdresser is wrong. I’ve never been a hairdresser before. \nBut you made the hair of Soma, the hair of Jon in the house so well… \nI think it’ just something I love doing. I love touching people’s hair. I love touching my friends’ hair. I love playing with their hair and all that. Besides, I have a very good talent which is, if you teach me something, I learn it. I’m a quick learner. \nWere you also a victim of domestic abuse as speculated? \nErmm, no actually. \nBecause this was linked to why you left your marriage… \nFirst of all, I have never been married before. It was actually rumours. So, no domestic violence, nothing. \nHow do you feel that BBNaija has revealed some of your best kept secrets? Would you want to attempt such reality shows in the future? \nHmm, how do I feel? Actually I feel good. I feel normal. Definitely, everyone’s secrets are going to come out. So, no big deal about that. And yes, I’d like to be in reality shows in the future. I think I will also have my own reality show but I don’t think I would want to go to any reality show because I’ve gotten what I wanted which was the Big Brother Naija. It’s a very very big platform. I think one of the biggest, so what more am I asking for? What more am I looking for? \nHow was it like spending a month without your phone and social media interactions? \nThe first week, I felt kind of lonely, I felt kind of sad, worried because a lady’s best friend is her mobile phone. So, I felt like, ‘where is my phone? Who’s holding my phone?’ That kind of crazy thoughts. But from the second week, I felt, ‘whatever men,’ I’m here to play a game. I’m here to win N25m. So, let me just focus my mind on the game plan and the money and everything and win everybody’s heart \nApart from losing the prize money, is there a way the game has made you a better person? \nActually, yes. First of all, I feel whatever that happens, God knows why. And it made me open to lots of great opportunities. Yes, it gave me few platforms and stuffs like that, yes, sure. \nWho among the other housemates do you wish to maintain a friendship with after the show? \nFirst is T-Boss, second is Miyonse, actually lastly is Soma. \nWhy? What qualities do they possess? \nNot just the qualities. But because they’re good friends to me. they’ve been quite nice and cool. I kind of observed that from their game plan, they’ve brought nice and little real things about themselves out. So, yes, they’re cool. \nWhere do you go from here? \nWhere do I go from here? To the highest tower in life is where I would go from here, achieve all my dreams, achieve my projects and lay a very strong foundation and make sure that I do the right thing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:46:13.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
