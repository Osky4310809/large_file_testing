The brand is marketing it as a ‘smartphone mate’. It works as a secondary device to make or receive calls via a connected smartphone over Bluetooth. The handset can also work as a standalone feature phone as it comes with a SIM card slot. One of the highlights of the device is its design, which resembles a credit card and weighs just 50 grams. \nThe brand’s press release mentions that the DOEL ET 106 can accept 4G SIM cards as well, which is a first. You will be able to receive calls using a telecom operator’s 4G SIM card on this device, but data or VoLTE can’t be used, so it’s pointless. \nAs far as the other specs go, the DOEL ET 106 features a 1.8-inch TFT display, a touch keypad, FM Radio, Bluetooth v3.0, multi-language support and micro-USB. It is powered by a 500mAh battery, which is rated to deliver four hours of talk time and four days of standby time. \nThe DOEL ET 106 feature phone is officially priced at Rs 3,000. However, the phone is up for grabs on Amazon India for as low as Rs 1,999. We have contacted the company to reveal how the 4G functionality works on this device. We will update you as soon as we get a response from DOEL.
