The scene culminates with multiple leitmotifs representing places, the past, emotions and psychological insight. The necessary balance was achieved, such that these musical representations were each clearly identifiable and helped foreshadow the change Siegfried was about to undergo. In that moment the orchestra took on a character all its own and was no longer merely commenting or supporting the action, but contributing actively to it. \nWith such large orchestral forces deployed, including Wagner tubas and six harps, the singers must not only lend their roles appropriate emotional depth but have the technique to project their voices above those of the instruments. Admittedly Wagner is not always forgiving in this regard, but there were obvious issues with balance at times. The tenor Simon O’Neill, singing the title role, encountered these problems early on, but quickly made the necessary adjustments to find the required projection. The tone that he lent to his characterisation of Siegfried displayed his transformation from naive and carefree boy to conqueror of the gods. \nJaap van Zweden on his musical journey, meeting his wife, and their son’s autism \nOther vocal highlights included a short, but assured turn by soprano Valentina Farcas as the Forest Bird, and David Cangelosi’s emotionally charged characterisation of the manipulative Mime. Cangelosi was suitably cunning in his delivery, carefully oscillating between espousing Mime’s inner thoughts and delivering dialogue with effortless simplicity. \nThe vocal highlight was undoubtedly American soprano Heidi Melton’s realisation of the great Brünnhilde. From the moment she walked on stage (her character technically still asleep at that point) she commanded the auditorium as she brought her vocal gifts to the challenging role. Melton was committed to expressing Brünnhilde’s emotional dilemma: to embrace the advances of Siegfried or to remain alone. Her vocal qualities are staggering – pure in the lower register and breathtakingly powerful in the upper register. \nMelton and O’Neill gave the evening a grand conclusion, physically embracing in the final measures to leave one in no doubt as to the direction Brünnhilde will take in The Ring’s final act, Götterdämmerung . \nFor Jaap van Zweden, Talent Is a Spartan Curse \nThe scene culminates with multiple leitmotifs representing places, the past, emotions and psychological insight.
