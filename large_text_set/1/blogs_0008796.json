They’re always trying increasingly tricky workouts to push their physical limits and test their mental mettle, and the badass results are often Instagram-worthy.

Duke’s fellow athlete, Jessica Vetter, follows the deadlift by completing a single-leg squat with a toe touch on top of Duke, who is just casually holding a plank while she balances on top of him.
