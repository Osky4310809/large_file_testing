If they are able to maintain it, the action would cause a major test for Republicans, who may have to decide whether to exercise the “ nuclear option ” and do away with the filibuster entirely. Now that his party is no longer in power, Schumer thinks that’s a bad idea. \nBut what’s worse than the hypocrisy is Schumer’s alleged reasons for opposing the judge. \n“Judge Gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me that he’d be an independent check on a president who has shown almost no restraint from executive overreach,” Schumer said. “Second, he was unable to convince me that he would be a mainstream justice who could rule free from the biases of politics and ideology.”   \nNever mind the fact that Gorsuch repeated over and over during the confirmation hearings that he is an independent judge with no “political leanings.” The Democrats are just whining about the fact that this is someone who nominated by Trump and Gorsuch is getting the fallout from their bitterness. \nLast March, Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to take over the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s place on the bench during his last year in office. \nRepublicans of the Senate denied Garland even a confirmation hearing because they saw what Obama was doing as a last ditch power move . \nNow Democrats are aiming for payback… but at what cost? The only people who will pay for this is the American people who will be left wondering when the Supreme Court can get back to business with a full team.
