Everything changed when Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea, and since then there has also been significant cash pumped into Manchester City, while Tottenham are also hugely improved.\nAccording to findings by Opta’s Orbinho , Arsenal have actually managed to achieve win percentages up there with the best sides in their history three times in the last four seasons.\nArsenal’s best ever record was 66% all the way back in 1930/31, followed closely by 65% in their double-winning year of 2001/02.\nBest-ever Arsenal win % (all comps) 1930/31 66 2001/02 65 2016/17 (ongoing) 64 1970/71 64 2014/15 63 2013/14 63 2003/04 63 1990/91 62 2007/08 62 Share\n\nHowever, this season’s side is currently on 64% – just one short of that team containing the likes of Thierry Henry and Robert Pires at their peak that is regarded as one of the finest sides in Premier League history.\nNot only that, it’s level with the 1970/71 double winners, and actually ahead of the 63% win percentage achieved by the 2003/04 Invincibles.\nMore: Football Arsenal hero blames Wenger for dismantling one of the club's greatest strengths \nMourinho explains why the goals have dried up for this Man Utd star \nAgent warns suitors Arsenal target now worth £51m after incredible game vs Barca \nArsenal fixtures Bayern Munich – Champions League (A) – Wed 15 Feb\nSutton – FA Cup (A) – weekend of 17/18 Feb\nLiverpool (A) – Sat 4 Mar\nBayern Munich – Champions League (H) – Tue 7 Mar\nLeicester (H) – Sat 11 Mar\nWest Brom (A) – Sat 18 Mar\nManchester City (H) – Sat 1 Apr\nWest Ham (H) – Tue 4 Apr\nOf course, the season is not over yet so the number could go down, but the 2013/14 and 2014/15 sides also achieved a very respectable 63% record, while the class of 2007/08 that narrowly missed out on the title ended with 62%.\nIn short, the standards have been raised and Arsenal can count themselves pretty unlucky to have just come up short so many times. Yes, their big game record could be far better, but there are more big games now than ever before. As well as that, off the pitch there is increased competition in the transfer market, and the Gunners aren’t quite in a position to outspend the likes of Chelsea and City on the players they perhaps would’ve landed in the past.\nIn different eras, they’d have won a great deal more. Time for Arsenal fans to take the work Wenger’s done with a little perspective?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:35:43.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
