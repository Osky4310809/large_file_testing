Researchers haven’t found any other examples of the unusual artifact. \nYad Vashem say they believe the pendant belonged to Karoline Cohn, a Jewish girl who died at Sobibór. Both Cohn and Frank were born in Frankfurt in 1929, and historians suggest a possible familial connection between the pair of teenagers. Researchers are currently trying to locate relatives of the two families to investigate further.

The Hebrew letter \"ה\" (God's name) as well three Stars of David are on the other side. \nThe personal items were found in the foundations of a building located on the \"Pathway to Heaven,\" the path along which victims were forced to walk to the gas chambers. It’s thought they fell through the floorboards and remained buried in the ground until they were discovered last year. \nREAD MORE: Nazi trail: Duped boot buyer’s swastika facepalm triggers troll fest (PHOTO) \nOther items found in the excavations included a Star of David necklace, a woman's watch and a metal charm covered in glass with an etching of the image of Moses holding the Ten Commandments. \nMore than 200,000 Jews were killed at the camp in Sobibór, which was destroyed by the Nazis following a revolt in October 1943. \n\"The significance of the research and findings at Sobibór grows with every passing season of excavation,” Israel Antiquities Authority archaeologist Yoram Haimi said . “Every time we dig, we reveal another part of the camp, find more personal items, and expand our knowledge about the camp. In spite of attempts by the Nazis and their collaborators to erase traces of their crimes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T02:19:07.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
