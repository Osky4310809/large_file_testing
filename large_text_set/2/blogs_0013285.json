President Trump’s potential Russian ties, coupled with his cavalier and unthinking attitude toward security and our allies, have put the safety of our country in peril. If Congress will not mount a strong independent investigation, I suggest that there are five people whose patriotism is unquestioned, even though I did not vote for all of them. I suggest that former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, the two Bushes and Barack Obama issue a joint bipartisan statement demanding investigation by an independent leader or group. That might convince even some Republican members of Congress about the desperation of our situation. It would certainly awaken the notice of almost every thinking person in this country regardless of political stance. I still believe that is where the true power to fix our course exists. I can only hope that it will be exercised before the cataclysm occurs. JOAN G. HAUSER Oak Ridge, Tenn. To the Editor: The Trump administration is throwing our intelligence agencies into turmoil. One should ask who benefits most when the United States intelligence agencies are impaired in their operations. \nAdvertisement I shudder to think of the answer to that question.
