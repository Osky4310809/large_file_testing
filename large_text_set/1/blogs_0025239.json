As a manager, this is the first time to go and play at Anfield. \n“For sure, it'll be a good experience, a good place to visit and, above all, to play our football. As manager, I'm excited for this experience.

Between some players. I know this. But now it's important, the present. It's important to see the present and have strong players to face this type of game. \n\"I'm sure I have this type of player.” \nIt is also a chance for Chelsea to prove how far they have come since the reverse fixture. \nThey suffered their first defeat under the Italian against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in September, and then lost badly at Arsenal the following weekend.

To find the right solution. To adapt better. Me, with the players and the players with me.
