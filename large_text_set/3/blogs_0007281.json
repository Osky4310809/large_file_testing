One such attempt at damage control came from Utah Representative Jason Chaffetz who visited CNN’s New Day Tuesday morning to discuss the plan with anchor Alisyn Camerota, but only succeeded in demonstrating just how woefully out of touch top Republicans are when it comes to the healthcare needs of millions of Americans.\nIn an astounding soundbite, Chaffetz compared healthcare coverage to getting a new iPhone, telling Camerota, “So maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care. They’ve got to make those decisions themselves.”\nAh, yes. Indeed. Really, it just boils down to people choosing between smartphones and doctors. So simple when you put it that way. Except that Chaffetz’s analogy is anything but simple, and aside the rich irony of him uploading a photo from his appearance to his “Jason in the House” Instagram account , Twitter was quick to jump on him to point out the flaws in his logic.\n\nI get a new iPhone every few years when my plan allows an upgrade. 20 minute doc appt for my husband last week cost a few hundred more.\n— Kat Kinsman (@kittenwithawhip) March 7, 2017 \nHow many cell phones do you buy in a year, Jason Chaffetz?
