The wait is over 2 hours long even with a appointment. Also, the office is very dirty Less than a year ago by a Verified Patient Bedside Manner Wait Time The office manager should address the patients being rude to the nurses they are mad because of the wait but the nurses should not be disrespcted by the patients....that really needs to be addressed Less than a year ago by a Verified Patient Bedside Manner Wait Time I really like Dr. Sarfo. He has a much better bedside manner than pretty much all the other doctors I've seen in this town. He actually lets you speak and listens! However, I don't love the office. I don't love that your vitals and personal information is discussed in a corridor while other patients are in exam rooms, doors open. That is very uncomfortable and makes me hesitant to return.
