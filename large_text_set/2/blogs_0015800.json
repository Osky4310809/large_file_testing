The rules require consumers to opt in before a broadband provider can sell their web-browsing and other information to advertisers and other third parties, and they require that users be notified when user data is breached by hackers. \nThe rules in question were passed in October. Sophos Home Learn More \nThe ISPs – including companies such as AT&T and Verizon – have lobbied hard against the privacy rules, which impose tougher privacy standards on them than on sites such as Google and Facebook. Such internet giants are governed by Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations. \nOne industry voice – Scott Cleland, chairman of NetCompetition, a pro-competition e-forum supported by broadband interests – described the privacy rules as the outcome of a turf war between the two federal agencies: \nPresident Obama’s Federal Communications Commission took a federal consumer privacy regulation situation that wasn’t broken, self-servingly broke it with Title II, and left it broken for over a year. Two weeks before the election, the agency finally advanced a “fix” that made most everything worse for everyone but the FCC. \nThe weapon that Republicans plan to wield to kill the privacy rules – the CRA – enables Congress to eliminate agency rules with a simple majority vote. It also bars an agency from reissuing the regulation at any point. \nSources told Politico that Senator Flake had about 12 co-sponsors lined up as of two weeks ago. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce’s technology subcommittee, has said that she was speaking with colleagues in the Senate “daily” about how to best use the CRA to undo the broadband privacy rules.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:02:42.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
