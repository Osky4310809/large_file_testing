Trudeau’s “disapproval” rating on economic policy is 41 per cent while Trump’s disapproval on this issue is just 22 per cent.\nCanadians surveyed by Mainstreet gave Trump 51-per-cent approval and 39-per-cent disapproval on the U.S. president’s approach to national security. Trudeau, by contrast had the approval of just 39 per cent of Canadians and the disapproval of 37 per cent.\nRelated Canadians not so ‘exceptional’ when it comes to immigration and refugee views, new study finds Stephen Gordon: Whatever Trump metes out, Canada will have to stomach Michael Den Tand: Trudeau ’s fine line on Trump has roots in Mulroney-Reagan diplomacy “For now, we could say Trump’s weaknesses are accentuating Trudeau’s strengths, but the tables could turn and it’s possible success for Trump in economic policy could create a negative contrast for Trudeau in Canada,” said Quito Maggi, Mainstreet’s president.\nBut on the three other policy areas Mainstreet asked about, it was all Trudeau. On immigration policy, health care policy, and his approach to foreign affairs, Trudeau’s approval rating was more than twice Trump’s approvals on the same issues.\nOn immigration, for example, just 17 per cent of Canadians approve of what Trump is doing versus 56 per cent approving of Trudeau’s approach.\nMainstreet’s poll was in the field before Trump issued his executive order temporarily halting all refugee arrivals in the U.S. and banning other immigration from a handful of Muslim-majority countries.\nDuring the 10-day survey period, Trump’s overall approval rating among Canadian voters peaked at 28 per cent and bottomed out, on Jan. 29, at 15 per cent.\nTrump’s net approval rating on Jan. 29 was -69 per cent.\nTrudeau’s net approval rating was +8 per cent, with 52 per cent of Canadians giving him a thumbs up for the job he is doing and 44 per cent giving him a thumbs down.\nFor now, we could say Trump’s weaknesses are accentuating Trudeau’s strengths, but the tables could turn.\nMainstreet also put seven descriptions of personal character before survey respondents, asking how many might be applied to each leader.\nTrump did not best Trudeau on any single characteristic but came close on “strong,” an adjective 48 per cent of Canadians would use about Trump but an adjective 52 per cent surveyed would use about Trudeau.\nJust 13 per cent would describe Trump as ‘compassionate’ while 65 per cent would describe Trudeau that way. Trudeau also scored high as “inspirational” (63 per cent).\nTrump’s lowest rating among the seven descriptions offered was ‘honest.’ Just 16 per cent of Canadians surveyed would use that word about Trump while 58 per cent called Trudeau honest.\nFor its survey, Mainstreet contacted 500 Canadians per day from Jan. 18 to Jan. 29. To track overall approval ratings, it used a rolling 1,500-person sample through that period. To gauge opinions on Trump versus Trudeau, it used results from the 1,500 people surveyed from Jan. 18-20.\nThe poll was conducted via random-digit dialling to landline and mobile phones. The pollster says its results are accurate to within 2.53 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.\n• Email: dakin@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidakin \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:24:07.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
