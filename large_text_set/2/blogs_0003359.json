When planning for retirement, you'll need to consider a variety of factors, such as when you'll retire, where you'll live and what you'll do. Keep in mind with each additional year you hope to retire early, your investment needs greatly increase. Also consider the difference in cost of living among cities, or even among neighboring ZIP codes. Add on daily expenses, medical expenses, vacations and emergencies, and you begin to see how the costs of retirement add up. \nYour retirement goals will depend largely on the income you can expect during your retirement and will likely evolve as your plans, risk tolerance and investment horizon change. While specific investing “rule of thumb” guidelines (like “You need 20 times your gross annual income to retire” or “Save and invest 10% of your pre-tax income) are helpful, it’s important to step back and look at the big picture. Consider these six essential rules for truly smart retirement investing. 1. Understand Your Retirement Investment Options \nYou can save for retirement in a variety of tax-deferred vehicles, some offered by your employer and others available via a brokerage firm or bank. It's important to take advantage of all your options, including investigating what kind of retirement benefits your employer may offer; some employers still offer defined benefit pensions , which is a big bonus during a time of volatility in the stock market. \nWhen building your portfolio in a retirement account, it's important to understand the risk/reward relationship when choosing your investments. Younger investors may focus on higher risk/higher reward investments, such as stocks, because they have decades left to recover from losses. People nearing retirement, however, are less able to recover and therefore tend to shift their portfolios toward a higher proportion of lower risk/lower reward investments, such as bonds (see Retirement Strategy: Should You Be Buying More Stocks? ). Retirement vehicles and common portfolio investments include: \nRetirement Vehicles 401(k)s and Company Plans – Employer-sponsored plans, including 401(k)s, that provide employees with automatic savings, tax incentives and (in some cases) matching contributions . Defined Benefit Plans – An employer-sponsored retirement plan in which employee benefits paid during retirement are based on a formula using factors such as salary history and duration of employment. Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) – Individual savings accounts that allow individuals to direct pretax income, up to annual limits, toward investments that can grow tax-deferred. Roth IRA – An individual retirement plan that bears many similarities to the traditional IRA, but contributions are not tax deductible and qualified distributions are tax free. SEP – A retirement plan that an employer or self-employed individual can establish. Contributions to SEP IRAs are immediately 100% vested, and the IRA owner directs the investments. SIMPLE IRAs – A retirement plan that can be used by most small businesses with 100 or fewer employees. \nPortfolio Investments Annuities – Insurance products that provide a source of monthly, quarterly, annual or lump-sum income during retirement. Mutual Funds – Professionally managed pools of stocks, bonds and/or other instruments that are divided into shares and sold to investors. Stocks – Securities that represent ownership in the corporation that issued the stock. Bonds – Debt securities in which you lend money to an issuer (such as a government or corporation) in exchange for interest payments and the future repayment of the bond’s face value. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) – Uniquely structured investment funds that trade like stocks on regulated exchanges that track broad-based or sector indexes, commodities and baskets of assets. Cash Investments – Low-risk, short-term obligations that provide returns in the form of interest payments (for example, CDs and money market deposit accounts ). Direct Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs) – Plans offered by corporations that allow you to reinvest cash dividends by purchasing additional shares or fractional shares on the dividend payment date. 2. Start Early \nNo matter what you read about retirement investing, one piece of advice stays the same: Start early . Why? Barring a major loss, more years saving means more money by the time you retire. You gain more experience and develop expertise in a wider variety of investment options. You have more time to survive losses, which increases your ability to recover from major hits and gives you more freedom to try higher risk/higher reward investments. You make saving and investing a habit. You can take advantage of the power of compounding – reinvesting your earnings to create a snowball effect with your gains. \nRemember that compounding is most successful over longer periods of time. Here’s an example to illustrate: Assume you make a single $10,000 investment when you are 20 years old and it grows at 5% each year until you retire at age 65. If you reinvest your gains (this is the compounding), your investment would be worth $89,850.08. \nNow imagine you didn't invest the $10,000 until you were 40. With only 25 years to compound, your investment would be worth only $33,863.55. Wait until you're 50 and your investment would be valued at just $20,789.28. This is, of course, an overly simplified example that assumes a constant 5% rate without taking taxes or inflation into consideration. It’s easy to see, however, that the longer you can put your money to work, the better. Starting early is one of the easiest ways to ensure a comfortable retirement. 3. Do the Math \nYou make money, you spend money. For many, this is about as deep as their understanding of cash flow gets. Instead of making guesses about where your money goes, you can calculate your net worth . Your net worth is the difference between what you own (your assets) and what you owe (your liabilities). Assets typically include cash and cash equivalents (for example, savings accounts, Treasury bills , certificates of deposit ), investments, real property (your home and any rental properties or a second home), and personal property (such as boats, collectibles, jewelry, vehicles and household furnishings). Liabilities include debts such as mortgages, automobile loans, credit card debt, medical bills and student loans. Adding up all of your assets and subtracting the sum of your liabilities leaves you with the total amount of money you truly possess (your net worth), and a clear view of how much money you'll need to earn to reach your goals. \nAs soon as you have assets and liabilities, it’s a good time to start calculating your net worth on a regular basis (yearly works well for most people). Since your net worth represents where you are now , it’s beneficial to compare these figures over time. Doing so can help you recognize your financial strengths and weaknesses, allowing you to make better financial decisions in the future. \nIt’s often said that you can’t reach a goal you never set, and this holds true for retirement planning. If you fail to establish specific goals, it’s difficult to find the incentive to save, invest and put in the time and effort to ensure you are making the best decisions. Specific and written goals can provide the motivation you need. Examples of written retirement goals: I want to retire when I’m 65. I want move to a small house near the kids. I want to travel internationally 12 weeks each year. I’ll need $48,000 each year to do these things. To retire at 65 and spend $48,000 for the following 20 years, I'll need a minimum net worth of $960,000 (a simplified figure that does not take into consideration taxes, inflation, changes to Social Security benefits, changes to investment earning rates, etc.). 4. Keep Your Emotions in Check \nInvestments can be influenced by your emotions far more easily than you might realize. Here's the typical pattern of emotional investment behavior: \nWhen investments perform well", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:55:13.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
