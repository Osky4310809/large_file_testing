You have my word that flyers of this nature will not be distributed home in the future.” \nFFRF is elated about the assurance. \n“It is always delightful to see a school district taking swift action to protect its young students,” says FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor. “We can only wish that other school districts were so promptly and fully responsive.” \nLook at that. No anger. No money involved. No lawsuits. Just a warning, followed by an apology. It would be better if this never happened in the first place, but after it did, this was the proper way to handle it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:59:10.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
