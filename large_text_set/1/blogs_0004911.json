At least one of the assailants can be heard saying “f— white people” and tells the victim to say “f— Donald Trump.” \nAccording to police, the 18-year-old victim was tied up and tormented for as long as five hours. He is now at home with his parents and expected to fully recover. Both the victim’s race and mental health factored into the decision to file hate crime charges against the four alleged assailants. \n“Let me be very clear: the actions in that video are reprehensible,” said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.

The two then traveled to the home of sisters Brittany and Tanishia Covington, where the torture was filmed. \nOfficers found the victim disoriented on the street, later connecting him to the video, which went viral earlier this week. \nThe incident has been referred to online as the #BLMKidnapping, though no evidence suggests the attack had any connection to the Black Lives Matter movement. \nPresident Obama said in a Thursday interview with Chicago’s WBBM that the attack was a “despicable sort” of hate crime. He went on to say that the public is highly sensitive to racial incidents now “in part because we see visuals of racial tensions, violence and so forth because of smart phones and the Internet.” \nWatch the full Chicago Police news conference below: CPD Arrested and Charged all four offenders with Hate Crime, as well as other charges. https://t.co/tqNH9eBISY \n— Chicago Police (@Chicago_Police) January 5, 2017 CPD Arrested and Charged all four offenders with Hate Crime, as well as other charges, from West Side kidnapping and attack.
