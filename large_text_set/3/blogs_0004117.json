Following a disappointing meeting with Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner last week to talk about education funding in Chicago, yesterday the recent Grammy winner held a press conference to announce he would be donating $1 million to Chicago Public Schools, which is facing a shortened school year due to budget issues. “Our kids should not be held hostage because of political positions,” he said, calling for others to join him in donating. \nNot only did Chance’s actions force Rauner to release his own statement ahead of the conference, but it inspired many in and beyond the city. Yesterday evening, Michelle Obama, a Chicago native who’s been known to spit her own verses —on the value of education, no less—thanked Chance in a tweet, calling him “an example of the power of arts education”: Thanks @chancetherapper for giving back to the Chicago community, which gave us so much. You are an example of the power of arts education. — Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) March 6, 2017 \nWatch the entire press conference, in which Chance flat-out tells Rauner to “do his job,” below. — Lil Chano From 79th (@chancetherapper) March 6, 2017 \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:09:19.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
