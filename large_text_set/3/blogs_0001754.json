To mark their anniversary, Facebook's released new data on Reactions use , noting that Reactions have been used 300 billion times in total since launch. That sounds like a lot, but for context, Facebook reportedly generates around 4 million Likes per minute . As such, Reactions are only contributing a very small amount of overall user response activity. \nBut even with their low usage rate, Facebook says that Reactions are a strong indicator of interest, and will be now be weighted more heavily by the News Feed. \nAs per Facebook (via Mashable ): \n\"Over the past year we've found that if people leave a Reaction on a post, it's an even stronger signal that they'd want to see that type of post than if they left a Like on the post, so we are updating News Feed to weigh reactions a little more than Likes when taking into account how relevant the story is to each person.\" \nSo Reactions are more powerful than Likes - but strangely, Facebook also says that all Reactions will be weighted the same. That means that whether you select 'Sad' or 'Angry' or 'Love' on a post, they'll all send a signal to Facebook that you want to see more of that type of content. It makes sense in that if you've actually gone to the effort to use a Reaction you must have felt strongly enough about the topic, but still, it seems like they could have used the specific Reaction data as more indicative individual measures. \nOr maybe there's not enough use of each to generate strong enough signals to point to subsequent user intent and interest. \nAlso, it could mean we see a heap more of these poll type posts in the near future. \nIn terms of specific use, Facebook says the ‘Love’ Reaction has been the most used, accounting for more than half of total Reactions – which is both somewhat surprising and kind of expected. \nIt’s surprising in that people had been calling for a 'dislike' option for so long that you’d expect some of the more negative responses would see more use – I mean, really, the ‘Love’ heart isn’t a heap different, in terms of response, to the traditional Like. \nBut at the same time, the ‘Heart’ emoji has always been popular – a study by Quintly last May showed that the ‘Love’ Reaction was already the most used on Facebook by far at that stage. \nIt's popular on other platforms too - Twitter, for example, changed their Favorite ‘Star’ to a heart partly in response to the rising use of the use of the heart emoji on their platform, and even checking emojitracker right now you can see that the heart is the second most used emoji on Twitter of all-time. \nBut it does seem like a bit of a waste. As noted, people wanted a negative response option, and while Facebook hasn’t provided an actual ‘dislike’ button, the hope of Reactions was that it would give people more ways to express themselves more easily, which would in-turn provide Facebook (and marketers) with more data. \nIn fact, that’s what we speculated would happen on launch - that eventually, Reactions data could provide a whole new range of emotional insights and tools which would enable better content targeting and creation. We’d be able to learn, for example, how posts that inspired the ‘Sad’ Reaction resulted in subsequent click-throughs, versus ‘Haha’ or ‘Wow’. \nFacebook even built this into the Insights tab - but with most of the Reactions response graphs looking like this: \nAnd with the adoption of Reactions being so low overall, they haven’t really been able to deliver any significant insights. \nIt seems that most people just want to be able to respond with a quick tap – maybe if Reactions were on screen all the time, as opposed to coming up when you hover over the ‘Thumbs up’ icon, that could increase their use. \nFacebook has also reported that Christmas Day last year saw the highest peak of Reactions use thus far - with ‘Love’ again leading the way - while the top ten nations, in terms of Reactions adoption, are: Mexico", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:15:40.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
