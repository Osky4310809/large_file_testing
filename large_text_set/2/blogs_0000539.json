So much so that if you've lived with an animal once, you can't ever live without one. That's because these fur balls make us happy. But, how many of us know exactly how they cast their spell? According to research , pets help reduce stress. Bonding with a pet releases the hormone oxytocin, which reduces blood pressure, and cortisol levels in the body. This directly counters the hazardous effects of stress, and works even when the owner has a poor lifestyle. Pets also keep you active. Walking or playing with your fur baby keeps you moving, and we all know of the wonderful benefits of exercise. It releases endorphins, which are the hormones responsible for making us happy and calming our nerves. Speaking of calming our nerves, the sheer act of petting a dog or a cat does the job quite well. Connecting with a pet also curbs loneliness. The archetype of the crazy cat lady, the older, single woman, who lives with a bunch of cats, is actually rooted in reality. Except the \"crazy\" bit. Pets provide company, and make being alone tolerable. But, that's not all. They also teach us patience, and compassion. Having a pet is like having a toddler for about fifteen years or so. They are always dependent on you, don't speak your language, but need a whole lot of love and care from you. You learn to communicate across barriers of language, and that's the most beautiful thing. A pet owner can tell what their baby wants from the look in their eyes, or the tone of their woof or meow. A pet can help you disconnect from all that stresses you, that's either in the past, or in the future. They can help you come into the present moment, and simply be in their company for some time. This skill, to be able to be in the now, has immense benefits both in the short and the long term. Pet therapy is, in fact, now an established sub-field of psychotherapy. And it's not just dogs and cats that play doctor. Horses, rabbits, and even dolphins come to heal humans. Called animal-assisted therapy, it is used to treat not only psychological issues like depression and anxiety, but also speed up recovery from heart diseases, and even cancer. In our narcissism, we forget that all life is powerful. It doesn't matter whether you speak or purr or neigh. Being around a pet is a humble reminder that life is larger than us!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:47:07.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
