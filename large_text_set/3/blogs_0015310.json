It will air on Vanderpump Rules, and then after the show, Katie and Tom are going to be on a new episode of Watch What Happens Live . The rumors have been flying that Tom and Katie might have a baby on the way and a post that Tom made on Snapchat today has everyone thinking that they are about to announce a pregnancy. Image By Tom Schwartz/Snapchat \nAs you can see in the post above, Katie Maloney looks like she could have on a maternity outfit. She is also pointing at the word “bump.” It really does appear that Tom Schwartz is hinting that Katie might be pregnant, but they aren’t sharing just yet. Fans are speculating that they might reveal it tonight on the new episode of Watch What Happens Live or it could be on the Vanderpump Rules reunion show. With this hint today, it wouldn’t be surprising if Tom made the announcement pretty soon. You know that everyone will be watching to see if she is drinking tonight on WWHL . Everyone is used to seeing a lot of shots, etc. on this show. \nKatie and Tom have been dealing with these pregnancy rumors for years, but now that they are married it is more likely that a baby is on the way. Also, the fact that Tom is teasing it so much might mean that is true. \nPeople shared that even though Katie Maloney isn’t speaking out about if she is pregnant or not, she is talking about finding her wedding dress and how it felt to her. Katie went to Kleinfeld Bridal store in N.Y.C. to find her dress. This is the store that is featured on Say Yes to the Dress . It only took her six dresses to find the perfect one. Katie shared how it made her feel when she found it. \n“The minute I put it on there were goosebumps all over. I thought, ‘This is it. This is the dress I’m going to marry Tom in.’ You just know. I had such a visceral reaction it was awesome. The lace and the detail was so perfect,” she says. “It felt like it was vintage, unique and special.” \nKatie Maloney found the perfect dress and everyone will get to see it when she marries Tom Schwartz on the show tonight. Lisa Vanderpump is actually the one who will be seen officiating their wedding. She also shared saying, “Tom likes my hair up so I wanted to wear my hair up and have it loose and ethereal so it would match with the vibe of the dress and the vibe of the wedding.” #PumpRules star @MusicKillsKate got goosebumps when she tried on her $15,000 Zuhair Murad wedding dress https://t.co/PvJBTW1fhR pic.twitter.com/lBa9dCBIVg \n— PeopleStyle (@peoplestyle) March 20, 2017 \nTom Schwartz and Katie Maloney have denied the pregnancy rumors for years, but now it just might be time for them to stop denying it and admit that a baby is on the way. If not, Tom Schwartz has a bit of explaining to do since the fans want to know what that new post he put up today means. If Katie has a baby on the way, that does mean that we won’t be seeing Tequila Katie anymore at least for a while. This might really help her marriage to Schwartz too considering they fight a lot when alcohol is involved. \nDo you think that Tom Schwartz and Katie Maloney have a baby on the way? Do you feel like they will announce it tonight? Don’t miss new episodes of Vanderpump Rules on Monday nights and also Tom and Katie tonight on Watch What Happens Live . \n[Featured Image By Jesse Grant/Getty Images for iHeartMedia]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:08:29.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
