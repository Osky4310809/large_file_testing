Huawei also joined the bandwagon and announced its successor to the P9 from last year: the P10 and P10 Plus. \nThe regular P9 comes with a 5.1-inch display while the P10 Plus features a larger 5.5-inch QHD display. Both phones are powered by Huawei’s own Kirin 960 chipset. The smaller handset features a 3200mAh battery, while the P10 Plus comes with a 3750mAh battery. Both devices also support Huawei’s Super Charge technology. \nThe P10 and P10 Plus are less than 7mm thin and are the world’s first smartphones to support 4.5G LTE. This essentially means that the handsets have a 4×4 MIMO antenna design that helps improve network reception and download speeds. \nDesign wise, while the P10 and P10 Plus look similar to the P9 from last year, Huawei will be launching the phones in 8 different colors and finishes. This includes Graphite Black, Rose Gold, Green, Silver, Blue, and Black. There is a new hyper diamond cut finish on the black and some other colors of the phone that is fingerprint and scratch resistant. \nThe P10 Plus sports a 20MP monochrome sensor that is paired with a bigger 12MP RGB sensor with OIS and. Both camera sensors make use of Leica’s SUMMILUX-H f/1.8 aperture lens and feature 4-in-1 hybrid autofocus that makes use of laserAF sensor as well. They also feature Huawei’s own custom hybrid zoom technology. The P10 also features the same 12/20MP camera setup but with a f/2.2 lens. Taking advantage of the 20/12MP camera setup, Huawei is also offering a ‘Portrait’ mode like feature in its camera app that helps in blurring the background behind the subject for a DSLR-like bokeh effect. \nHuawei’s excellent manual camera mode is available on both devices, and they also record 4K videos using H.265 codec for a 50 percent reduction in space. Taking advantage of its partnership with Leica, the P10 and P10 Plus come with Leica’s Portraiture mode. \nThe selfie camera now also features a Leica lens and is now paired with a sensor that is twice as bright as before. It now features an 8MP sensor with a f/1.8 lens. \nOn the software front, the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus run on Huawei’s latest Emotion UI — v5.1 — that is now based on Android 7.0 Nougat. Huawei has tweaked every aspect of its skin and OS to improve app loading times by as much as 30 percent. The new highlights feature in the Gallery app of the P10 is powered by GoPro and offers similar functionality as HTC’s Zoe and Google Photos’ automatic video creation. \nThere is no word on the US launch of the handset, but they will be launching in certain parts of Europe and the UK in March for €649 and €699, respectively.
