Some videos have been incorrectly labeled and that’s not right. We’re on it! More to come. \n— YouTube Creators (@YTCreators) March 20, 2017 A message to our community … pic.twitter.com/oHNiiI7CVs \n— YouTube Creators (@YTCreators) March 20, 2017 \nSome of YouTube’s more famous personalities weren’t too pleased with the language of the statement. \nJenna Marbles, who boasts over 17 million subscribers, said the apology was of dubious genuineness. @YTCreators @YouTube If they’re a tiny subset then why are you catering your platform to them. I’m sorry dad but this is not only vague but seems like a lie. \n— Jenna Marbles (@Jenna_Marbles) March 20, 2017 \nThe Twitter hashtag #YouTubeIsOverParty was trending on the social media platform for some time over the weekend.
