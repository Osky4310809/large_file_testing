Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nArsene Wenger has warned his Arsenal players they need to start showing up in big games. \nIncredibly, Arsenal have managed just two wins from their last 18 away games at their top six rivals Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea. \nAnd both of those wins - at Tottenham and Manchester City - came when Mesut Ozil was not playing with the Germany midfielder also a big doubt for the trip to Anfield because of illness. \nOzil, who was struggling with a cold, missed training this week and Wenger admitted he is unsure he will be fit. But Ozil was injured for the win at Tottenham in March 2014 and an unused substitute at City in January 2015.

If you play for Arsenal, you always owe us a performance. You cannot say you want to play for Arsenal and not perform. Everybody wants to perform of course. \n“What is linked many times with belief is being in a passive mode and not being proactive, you have to make things happen.
