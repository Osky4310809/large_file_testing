One sign held by a young child said: \"Don't Ban My Grandma and Grandpa.\" \nAnother protester took direct aim at Trump with a sign that read: \"Your comb-over doesn't cover your xenophobia.\" \nAttendees included U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh. \nWalsh said in a tweet that the city is standing strong \"to support & protect ALL of our people & we will not back down.\" Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:19:36.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
