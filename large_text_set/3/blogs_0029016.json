Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com) | Updated March 24, 2017 - 10:44am Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach during a recent event in Bonifacio Global City. Philstar.com/Deni Rose M. Afinidad-Bernardo \nMANILA, Philippines — After seeing the candidates for the upcoming Binibining Pilipinas 2017 pageant, Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach said, “madaming magaganda!” \n“Now that we’ve seen the new format of Miss Universe, we now know that Q&A is going to be pretty tough, so, I’m excited to see if Binibini will change its format as well. I think they should,” she told the press in an interview for a recent Downy Parfum event in Bonifacio Global City. \n“Binibini should focus more on the question and answer, because with what we remember, 10 percent lang ng judging ang Q&A. Pero ‘pag nanood tayo ng Miss Universe, minsan, ‘yun na ang make or break na eh. So, I was hoping to have it changed a little bit and focus more on the question and answer.” \nShe believes that just as Miss Universe has been evolving, so should Binibini, too. “It’s time for Miss Universe to become more relatable, more approachable, become more real.” \nThis summer, her plan is to raise funds for her hometown. “My friends tease me that I hoard clothes, but I don’t. The clothes that I wore in Miss Universe, inipon ko sila, and I had them put in boxes and sent to the Philippines because I’m planning to do like a garage sale or an auction…and all the proceeds, I’m planning to donate to Cagayan de Oro because I never had the chance to do a homecoming there. It’s my way of giving back.” \nBesides acting, the beauty queen is open to promoting advocacies for free. She is currently on the crusade to increase awareness for HIV/AIDS and children with cleft lip or palate.
