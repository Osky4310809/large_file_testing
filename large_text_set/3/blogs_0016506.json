David Perkins revealed that a US ally took down an adversary’s off-the-shelf quad-copter with a Patriot missile.\nThe skirmish, which ultimately cost the country millions and the attacker only a few hundred dollars, makes a case for laser lovers. Proponents of the tech, according to the Washington Post , suggest it would be cheaper and more efficient than munition systems.\nThe proof is in the pudding: In 2015, Lockheed used a 30 kW fiber laser weapon, known as ATHENA, to disable a truck from a mile away. Just imagine what 60 kW could do.\nAccording to the company, this machine is capable of translating more than 43 percent of its electricity directly into the beam it emits.", "external_links": ["http://lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do/aerospace-defense/directed-energy.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v7nfB5bV3E", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/03/16/lockheed-martin-says-it-is-ready-to-hand-over-laser-weapon-to-u-s-army-for-testing/?utm_term=.23ee0d8f06ac", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lockheed-martin-to-deliver-world-record-setting-60kw-laser-to-us-army-300424870.html"], "published": "2017-03-20T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:06:26.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
