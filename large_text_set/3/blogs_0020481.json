These drills are regarded as a rehearsal for invasion by North Korea. Earlier this month, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles into the sea off Japan’s northwest coast, and conducted rocket-engine function tests that Seoul said showed “meaningful progress.”\nAs a counter-measure to North Korea’s nuclear and missile threat, Reuters reported Monday that the Trump administration was considering imposing deeper sanctions that would freeze Pyongyang out of the global financial system.\nHowever, in an interview with the news agency the following day a North Korean envoy said that the country would pursue the “acceleration” of its nuclear and missile programs — including developing “pre-emptive first strike capability” — regardless of the threat of further sanctions.\nReferring to the reported sanctions, Choe Myong Nam, deputy ambassador at the North Korean mission to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters, “I think this is stemming from the visit by the Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson] to Japan, South Korea and China … We of course are not afraid of any act like that.”\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:31:33.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
