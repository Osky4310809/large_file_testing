After witnessing and being a part of the masses who came together for the Women’s March on Washington, as well as so many other marches around the world, we felt the need to continue doing anything we can to help the cause.\nAs of right now, Planned Parenthood is in danger, due to the new administration. Therefore, affordable access to women’s health services and education is also in danger, and those services are things women cannot afford to lose . We’ve compiled a list of online shops and fundraising campaigns that are donating some or all of their profits to Planned Parenthood. By shopping on these sites, not only are you getting some really cool feminist merchandise, but your money is going to help your sisters who rely so much on Planned Parenthood.\n1. Omaze — Lena Dunham’s “Don’t Hang Up The Gloves” shirts ($27) If you’re not familiar with Omaze, it’s a pretty Omaze-ing website (sorry).

Writer and actress, Lena Dunham, teamed up with Omaze to raise money for the Planned Parenthood Education Fund by selling these very cool feminist t-shirts.\nSubtle rainbow to keep up the theme Don’t hang up your gloves!
