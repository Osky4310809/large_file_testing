My own husband doesn’t always agree with me. My own family doesn’t always agree with me.” \nHer primary objective in For The Record , which premieres Monday at 6 p.m. ET, will be to “do a really good job for the viewers and voters at home, because these are very, very serious times.” \nThe show will replace rebroadcasts of Bloomberg’s With All Due Respect , which ceased production late last year. \nAs Maddow pointed out during the interview, Van Susteren, who rose to prominence during her coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder trial for CNN, will soon become one the few broadcasters to have “had careers at all three of the major competing cable news outlets.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
