Teresa, given your work at the Ms. Foundation, I'm wondering if you could help us to tie that together? Teresa Younger: There is so much of what we see and what we don't see, and how if you can't see it, you can't be it—and yet if you let your imagination go, you can see so much. At the Ms. Foundation I think that's exactly what happens. We see and trust that women actually have the answers to direct their lives. They knew what they needed to do. They needed to continue to stand together and, for me, the scene where Mary is talking to her husband and she tells him there are other ways to fight in the civil rights war—that conversation reminds me of so many women we work with, who are doing it their own way. There is no wrong way to fight for equality. You have to figure out what fulfils your dream, and you have to step forward and do it, and not let anybody stop you in the process. On the importance of telling stories Harris-Perry: Kaitlyn, I've been thinking about this recovery of stories that are lost or buried, submerged in our history, and I often hear the idea that we can't be what we can't see. Then I think of the black imagination as a whole—in certain ways it is part of our extraordinary gift to the American project, that we are constantly able to do things that we have never seen. So the stories that you tell as a novelist, as a creator, are certainly rooted in us but are also created. Talk to me about how you tell us stories and how that is also a part of this.

Kaitlyn Greenidge: Probably everyone in this room can agree that stories are really magical things, that they can help us figure out ways to respond to problems in our own lives and help us imagine solutions to problems in our own lives. So I think that when we have stories like this, like Hidden Figures , you can learn or imagine different ways to be, which is why it's so important to have just a proliferation of stories like this. One of the things that I really loved about this movie, is that we see people working within the system and out of the system—people deciding when they need to break the rules and when they need to follow them. Oftentimes, the stories that we tell ourselves about progress are that there is only one way, or that there are wrong ways and that what we're doing is not going to work out. In this movie, we see that all these ways of moving forward are happening all at the same time. It opens up the stories that we can tell ourselves about how we're going to survive and thrive in the coming years. 20th Century Fox Janelle Monáe on playing Mary Jackson \"I just want to say it's a complete honor to portray such a genius. The exciting thing about this film is that I get to portray someone that was not going to sit back idly and allow discrimination to stand in the way of her dreams. She was not going to allow sexism and racism to get in the way of her dream of becoming an engineer. She was an incredible mathematician but she knew that she had something else to offer and she changed the face of what it meant to be an engineer at NASA and became the first African-American woman [to become one]. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below So when you think about what it means to be the first, as someone who works in the music industry as well, there were a lot of things that I wanted to do when I got involved with that. One was redefining what it meant to be sexy, what it meant to create music as a young African-American woman in the music industry. I love telling stories and so as someone who wants to tell these untold, universal, unique stories in unforgettable ways about the uncelebrated, the other, that person who is oftentimes discriminated against whether it's for gender or sexual orientation or for race—she embodied everything. She wasn't going to play the victim. She was a fighter and she was not just fighting for herself, but for her community. She knew that fighting and seeking justice to become the first to do something was a scary road. I had to pull out those moments where I was told no, those moments where I was told my dreams were not valid. I had to connect with those moments and, so, combined with my own experiences throughout my life as a young woman and research, I was able to tap into her magic.\" Most Popular On multidimensional, nuanced black female characters Harris-Perry: How much did everyone appreciate—I know I did—that these women are ultimately not put in a position of having to choose between being geniuses and nerds and being loved? Being loved romantically, being loved by their families, being loved by their children—and they get to come home late at night and still be loved by their children. \nThe great thing about this movie is that it highlights our nuances as women. We're complicated, we're complex, we're complete human beings—and oftentimes we're played as one-dimensional characters. Monáe: The great thing about this movie is that it highlights our nuances as women. We're complicated, we're complex, we're complete human beings—and oftentimes we're played as one-dimensional characters, you know. We can do both, we can do it all, and that's the exciting thing: Finally not only are we celebrated for being moms or being beautiful, but we're not going to be celebrated for being objects. We're subjects to study until the end of time. On the importance of black women being protagonists Murray: Very rarely do you see a black woman on a movie poster. Usually it's been Zoe Saldana who has been in Guardians of the Galaxy , so, as an alien; there is The Help , but it was shared with white people—no offense, shout out to the white people. But what I love—they made this movie before the book was even out. That's rare and amazing, so I hope that this will prove—and I think we all need to go out and support this movie when it comes out—that black women can open up a movie, that it can open up and have a great movie weekend. In a way it's political, because it needs to show Hollywood that it will not be #oscarssowhite this season. \nVery rarely do you see a black woman on a movie poster. Shetterly: One of the things that was really important for me is that they were protagonists. It has been very rare is to see a black woman as a protagonist. And also as three-dimensional people—mathematicians, mothers, wives, complicated people, not perfect. All of these women were that in real life and Mary Jackson, in particular. She tapped out in her career as an engineer. She reached the point where she couldn't go anymore. She made the decision to take a demotion, leave the engineering track, and move into human resources because she felt like her job was to really advocate for other women, and that's what she did. She was also a real bridge-builder, and she found allies in many white women, and they worked together to advance the cause of all of the women. On how the historical context of 'Hidden Figures' is still relevant today Shetterly: These women were dealing with Jim Crow. At this time, black women didn't have the opportunity to have a say-so in their democracy—they couldn't even vote. So they got through it. They sent the first Americans into space. They did not allow race or gender to get in the way of making that happen because genius has no race. I think if we can look at the racial tension and the divisive tactics that were happening during that era, and they made it through that and achieved the extraordinary—if we did it back then, we can do it now. So I just hope that people leave feeling a deeper sense of commitment to humanity and coming together and setting aside our differences, and not allowing those things to get in the way of us moving forward as a country.
