But I don’t understand. I feel like if Kaden had just had the medication he needed earlier he would be here today.\n‘He had been so unwell for so long he never even complained from the pain, but he needed help. I was taking him to school – he was sitting through it and not complaining.\nDoctors first sent him home with Calpol and Ibuprofen and his family said it took two years for doctors to diagnose him (Picture: MEN) ‘It took two years to get Kaden an appointment at Alder Hey, they diagnosed him straight away but it was too late.’\nThe family’s ordeal began two years ago, when Kaden woke up one day with pain in one of his ankles, which a GP diagnosed as a sprain.\nBut the pain grew worse, and 18 months ago later when it moved to his other ankle, Caitlin took him to Blackpool Victoria Hospital’s A&E.\nSomeone egged Nigel Farage in the street Blood tests showed him to have a vitamin D deficiency and anaemia.\nIn hospital for a week, he was discharged with a bottle of Calpol and Ibuprofen as well as vitamin D and iron tablets.\nThe pain spread to Kaden’s knees then all his joints.\nReferred to Rheumatology at Blackpool, Caitlin claims they gave him more Calpol despite an ultrasound showing tissue damage.\nCaitlin added: ‘It was worse in the morning, he couldn’t walk, he couldn’t even scratch his own nose his hands were so swollen and stiff.\n‘We got referred to a physio – the therapist said I was doing too much for Kaden and that’s why he wasn’t able to do things himself. I felt like I was banging my head against a brick wall.’\nDrunk man who was filmed racially abusing bus passenger is jailed At Blackpool Hospital, blood tests showed again showed that he was anaemic, despite the iron tablets.\nFinally, after months of delays, Kaden got an appointment at Alder Hey Hospital, where doctors were so shocked they suspected leukaemia.\nThey diagnosed systemic onset juvenile arthritis and started a course of steroids – which immediately began to ease his pain.\nBut the arthritis was already attacking Kaden’s joints and organs and he was placed on a high dependency unit.\nAfter six weeks in hospital, he finally turned a corner and his family celebrated with the nurses as he took his first steps in months.\nMan's racist rant was so bad it made a girl, 12, vomit But the next day, Kaden complained of a ‘stabbing pain’ in his stomach and he was taken to intensive care where his heart stopped.\nCaitlin added: ‘They had all these wires on him, they had to open his chest, I could see his heart and his lungs. They were trying to stop him bleeding but it was just pouring from him.\n‘I knew he was going and there was nothing they could do. I was just screaming at them to try.’\nKaden died the following day and doctors told the family it was caused by sepsis as a result of his arthritis.\nCaitlin, who is training to be a social worker, added: ‘I want to know exactly what happened.\n‘I want everyone to know. How can a healthy boy go from having a sore ankle two years ago to being gone?\n‘I’m training to be a social worker, I know what the standards should be.\nWhy did it take so long to get a diagnosis?\nDescribing Kaden as loving, kind and caring, she added: ‘If he was in pain he would just entertain himself, play on his computer. When his friends came round Sometimes he was too weak to\nplay with them. ‘I had to take him to school in a pram in the end, he didn’t like it, he said everyone would think he was a baby.\n‘He was in agony every day and he never moaned. Everyone who ever met him loved him.’\nA spokesman for Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘Our thoughts are with Kaden’s family at this sad time. Upon hearing of his death the trust initiated a case review\nwhich is ongoing and is standard procedure in all children’s deaths.’\nA spokeswoman for Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘Our thoughts remain with the family at this extremely difficult time.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:03:18.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
