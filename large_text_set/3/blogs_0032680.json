Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. \nAny devoted Game of Thrones fan , whether they also read the books or are show-only fans, is also up on the most relevant theories about the characters. While you might not subscribe to each and every crazy theory out there, it's gotten to the point that if you don't know the most basic theories, you're way out of the loop. One of these theories was the long-held R + L = J theory , which was confirmed at the end of season six. \nNow, with season seven on the horizon, and certain characters getting more focus in the previews than others, it's time we talk about another longtime theory that was kicked off at the very beginning of the book series. It's about the end of the show and, essentially, who ultimately wins in the titular game of thrones — so if you don't want to know, turn back now. The Theory: A Song of Ice and Fire Gives the Ending Away \nThe title Game of Thrones is the name of the TV series but not George R. R. Martin's book series. The first book is called A Game of Thrones , but the whole book series , comprising the already-published five books (and the two still to come), is called A Song of Ice and Fire . A lovely name, to be sure, but what if it's more than that? ADVERTISEMENT What If Ice and Fire Signify Certain People? \nWhat if this epic \"song\" is about how two characters — symbolized by ice and fire — come together in the end? The obvious characters are: Jon Snow = Ice \nJon has pretty much been living in the icy cold of the Wall and beyond for six seasons. Daenerys Targaryen = Fire \nThere has been tons of fire imagery associated with Daenerys on the show, including her own \"rebirth\" in the first season in a funeral pyre for Khal Drogo, her dragons breathing fire, and of course, that badass walk through fire in Vaes Dothrak . Also: the Targaryen words are \"Fire and Blood.\" Therefore, A Song of Ice and Fire = A Song of Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen \nA stretch? Could be, but consider the two characters who fans have an undying love for and who both seem destined for something more. There's also the fact that Jon's resurrection is not just a major indication of his destiny, but also a distinct parallel to Daenerys's similar immunity to certain death in the same season. Thus, we could be watching the story of how the Seven Kingdoms are destined for two rulers, not just one, and the Iron Throne will be cozily shared by Jon and Daenerys. Also, since Jon is a Targaryen, you might be pointing out that that makes him and Daenerys related (technically, she'd be his aunt), but marrying within the family has always been a Targaryen custom. \nAnd though I suppose other characters could fulfill the ice and fire symbols, it's almost too obvious. Also, consider those Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke poses for Entertainment Weekly that preceded season three (interesting for characters who have never yet shared a frame on the show) and the three heads of the dragon theory that is also gaining traction. What's more, the closer we get to season seven, the more we see how Jon and Daenerys are going to be together somehow in the new season, whether that's as allies or enemies. But it's undeniable: the end has to be all about these two. \nHonestly, this \"theory\" doesn't feel so much like a spoiler but the kind of ending that feels right, in a show that often disappoints you with its character deaths and tragedies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:10:48.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
