Scott has apparently been working on Astroworld , and is heading out on the road for his Bird’s Eye View tour throughout the spring. \nAnother noticeable feature of the tweet is that it doesn’t necessarily refer to an album, leaving the message open for interpretation that the two might just drop a track or a mixtape together. \nThe two just appeared as features on Drake’s More Life track “Portland” and released “Go Off” with Lil Uzi Vert for the Fate Of The Furious soundtrack earlier this month. \nThis wasn’t the only moment of excitement on Scott’s Twitter this weekend: the rapper also revealed that his mom had begun dragging him over his appalling spelling on social media. After he had coined the word “happynes” in an earlier tweet, he shared a text from his mom setting him straight. \n“Baby it’s spelt happiness u know we raised you better than that!!” \n— TRAVIS SCOTT (@trvisXX) March 17, 2017 \nLuckily for Scott, he had the perfect response in store… \n— TRAVIS SCOTT (@trvisXX) March 17, 2017 Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
