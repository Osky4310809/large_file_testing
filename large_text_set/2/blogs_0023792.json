At only 39 light-years away, scientists say the nearby system is our best bet for finding life beyond our solar system .

Trappist-1e, f and g are thought to have the best chance of supporting life.

All the planets found around Trappist-1 are of similar size to the Earth. Photo by: ESO/O. Furtak 7 Earth-like planets could be best bet to find alien life Two systems compared \nThis chart compares the seven Trappist-1 planets with the planets of our inner solar system. Researchers first spotted exoplanets around the dim dwarf star in 2016, but recently discovered it's orbited by more Earth-like planets than originally thought.

All the planets found around Trappist-1orbit much closer to their star than Mercury is to the sun, but as their star is far fainter, they are exposed to similar levels of irradiation as Venus, Earth and Mars in the Solar System.

The planet orbits in the habitable zone and is Earth-sized and probably rocky like our world. The side of the planet that permanently faces Trappist-1 could be covered by a large liquid ocean that might even support life.
