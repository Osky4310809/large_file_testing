He not only has a brilliant legal mind, but has both the experience and the temperament needed to serve on our nation’s highest court. Judge Gorsuch’s deep understanding and reverence of the law will serve him and the American people well.” \nU.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Arvada : “While I have not had a chance to review Judge Neil Gorsuch’s record, I know Neil to be an honest and intelligent Coloradan. However, I will remain vigilant against any Supreme Court decision that turns back the clock on issues of liberty, equality and opportunity for all Americans.” \nU.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Denver : “President Trump has repeatedly promised that his nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court would be someone who supports overturning Roe v. Wade. We have no reason to believe he has changed his mind. That’s what makes this nomination especially troubling for women all across the country. Judge Gorsuch needs to clarify his position on women’s right to access and determine their own reproductive health care at a time when seven in 10 Americans support a woman’s constitutionally-protected right to choose.” \nU.S. Reps. Scott Tipton, Ken Buck, Doug Lamborn and Mike Coffman, Republicans : “The nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court is welcome news. Judge Gorsuch’s record on the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit shows that he will defend the original intent of our Founding Fathers and preserve the fundamental rights of Americans protected by the Constitution. It will be great to see a Coloradan serve on the country’s highest court, and considering he was confirmed for his current position by voice vote in the U.S. Senate, we encourage our Colorado colleagues in the U.S. Senate to support Judge Gorsuch’s swift confirmation.” \nProgressNow Colorado Executive Director Ian Silverii : “Neil Gorsuch is just the latest in a series of horrible choices by Donald Trump. Gorsuch’s fringe views on health care and contraception make him an enemy of Colorado women. On the Supreme Court, Gorsuch would be a vote to roll back women’s rights, environmental protections, and hard-won protections against discrimination in the workplace. …The simple fact is that this Supreme Court appointment was stolen from President Obama last year in a shameful act of Republican treachery. No Democrat should in any way cooperate with or otherwise enable Gorsuch’s Supreme Court nomination, including Colorado Democrats. To do so would only hand Trump another undeserved victory.” \nJudicial Crisis Network Chief Counsel Carrie Severino : “Neil Gorsuch is exceptionally qualified — a fair and independent judge who bases his decisions on the Constitution, and he is widely respected on both sides of the aisle. He was confirmed unanimously to one of our highest courts in 2006, and I am confident he will receive bipartisan support again this time. Some Democrats may be tempted to obstruct his nomination, but we have already launched a robust campaign in key states, and we will ultimately force vulnerable Senators to choose between obstructing and keeping their Senate seats.” \nFreedom for All Americans Executive Director Matt McTighe : “Religious freedom is a value that all Americans respect and which has been enshrined for centuries in our Constitution. Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch has exhibited a dangerous history of prioritizing religious beliefs over equal protection and equal treatment for all people. … With a record of defending religious liberty at the cost of infringing on individual liberties, Gorsuch’s confirmation could mean the rollback of basic freedoms and crucial protections for vulnerable LGBT people across America.” \nColorado Republican Party State Chairman Steve House : “Tonight, President Trump fulfilled one of his biggest campaign promises to the American people by selecting federal appeals court Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, a mainstream conservative to serve on the United States Supreme Court. I am confident Neil Gorsuch will faithfully uphold the Constitution, protect our individual rights, and preserve the idea of limited government.” \nNARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue : “With Judge Neil Gorsuch, the stakes couldn’t be higher when it comes to women and our lives. Gorsuch represents an existential threat to legal abortion in the United States and must never wear the robes of a Supreme Court justice.” \nColorado State Senate President Kevin Grantham, R-Canon City : “Coloradans of all parties and persuasions can be proud tonight to see Colorado-born U.S. Circuit Court Judge Neil Gorsuch nominated by the President of the United States to fill the current vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. … If confirmed, he will make an outstanding addition to the Court, and I invite all Coloradans to join me in applauding this outstanding nomination.” \nLIBRE Initiative President Daniel Garza : “Judge Gorsuch believes judges should interpret laws based on their text, has served in the Justice Department, clerked for two Supreme Court justices, and is an excellent, competent candidate to fill the seat. We believe that with this pick, Judge Gorsuch will help ensure that our constitutional rights are protected, while advancing the foundations of a free society through the rule of law.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:16:03.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
