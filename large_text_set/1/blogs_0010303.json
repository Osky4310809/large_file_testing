According to a report from The Investor , Samsung wants to ship 60 million units of its flagship device in 2017, a big step up from the previous Galaxy S generations.\nSamsung shipped 45 million units of the Galaxy S6 and 48 million Galaxy S7 devices. Increasing shipment by 25 percent to 60 million units means that the upcoming flagship will have to bring quite a few new and interesting features to the table that will spark consumer interest. Especially after the whole Note 7 fiasco , which didn’t do the company’s reputation any good.\nThe report also states that the rumors claiming the Galaxy S8 will be released a month later than its predecessor are true. The tech giant will start manufacturing the device in March and begin shipping it to retailers in mid-April.\nSee also: Samsung estimates highest Q4 profit in 3 years despite Note 7 cancellation 3 days ago Some market analysts don’t believe that Samsung will be able to achieve its ambitious goal of shipping 60 million units of its flagship device this year. The high-end smartphone market is getting more and more competitive, as we have seen a lot of great devices, like the OnePlus 3T , that offer a better price-performance ratio than Samsung’s Galaxy S series. The South Korean company is already taking a beating in India, where it’s losing ground against Chinese brands .\nKeep in mind that these is just speculation for now. Samsung has proven many times that it knows how to make great phones that sell extremely well on the market. The Galaxy S8 just might surprise market analysts and achieve or even surpass its goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T13:03:57.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
