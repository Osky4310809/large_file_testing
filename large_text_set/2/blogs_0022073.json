Which is why we’re loving Pink’s latest post about her post-baby weight loss .\nPink has been very open in the past about not giving into pressure to conform to any specific body type after pregnancy (she proudly declared that she hadn’t lost any weight six weeks after giving birth, because, “I’m normal.”) And now, she just shared this pic on her Insta account:\nCommitment #5down30togo \nA post shared by P!NK (@pink) on Feb 22, 2017 at 10:31am PST \nThat’s right. A makeupless selfie that simply says, “Commitment #5down30togo .” And this comes several weeks after she posted this snap with her personal trainer on her first day getting back to the gym.\nDay 1 Lets do this @msjeanettejenkins (week 6 post baby and I haven't lost ANY WEIGHT YET!!!!) yaye me I'm normal! \nA post shared by P!NK (@pink) on Feb 6, 2017 at 11:03am PST \nThere is no smoke and mirrors here. Pink (a self-proclaimed fitness enthusiast ) isn’t donning the cover of a glamorous magazine a mere few weeks after creating life to show the world her once-again “perfect” physique (again, whatever the EF that means). She’s slowly but surely sweating it out at the gym after allowing her body some necessary recovery time.\nTHIS is the reality of working towards a fitness goal after pregnancy. It’s not especially glamorous, and it’s rough, and it’s TOTALLY AND PERFECTLY NORMAL to not be running to the gym the second you give birth.\nThanks, Pink, for keeping it real and reminding us that fitness is a journey, and that rushing it is not healthy or normal. Because sometimes it can be all too easy to forget.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:05:41.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
