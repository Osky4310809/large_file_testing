By Erin Strout Friday, March 3, 2017, 12:43 pm After running a personal best at the 2017 Boston University Last Chance indoor meet, Johnny Gregorek (left) and his father, John (right, competing for Georgetown University in the early 1980s), are currently the fastest father-son duo in the mile. Photo Run/AP \nJohnny Gregorek, a member of the New Jersey-New York Track Club, knew the indoor mile race at Boston University last Saturday would result in a fast time—reliable pacing was set up, two of his teammates were racing, and Edward Cheserek was going for an NCAA record. \nWhat he didn’t realize that another record was his for the taking.

Cheserek, finishing in 3:52:01, won and set the new collegiate mark. Kyle Merber, Gregorek’s teammate, was right on Cheserek’s heels in a best time of 3:52.22. Then Gregorek crossed the line in 3:53.15—also a personal record. \nIt wasn’t until later that Gregorek, 25, found out that his race result also meant he and his dad, John Gregorek, 56, are now the fastest father-son duo. It’s an unofficial mark, but only 10 such dads and sons have ever broken the four-minute-mile barrier . The senior Gregorek competed for Georgetown University and twice made the U.S. Olympic team in the 3,000-meter steeplechase (1980 and 1984). He also ran a 3:51.34 mile in 1982. \n“Once I was done with the race, my dad was really pumped up about it and joking around that I was getting way too close to his mile PR,” the younger Gregorek said during a phone interview with Runner’s World on Thursday. “When we found out we got the fastest combination we were kind of laughing about it—it’s a fun bragging rights thing.” \nThe Gregoreks’ fastest mile times now average 3:52.25. Next on the list are Kip and Martin Keino, from Kenya, with a 3:52.72 (both are retired). Then comes the Centrowitz family, with an average of 3:52.74— Matthew is the 2016 Olympic 1500-meter champion with a mile PR of 3:50.53 and his dad, Matt, a two-time Olympian (1976 and 1980) clocked a 3:54.94 back in his day. \n“Maybe Centro will answer back with another PR and we’ll have to battle back-and-forth for the title,” Gregorek said. \nAlthough the record isn’t an official one—the full list is kept by the Bring Back the Mile organization—it holds some sentimental meaning for at least one son who carries on the speedy traits of his father. \n“It’s nice to be able to share this with my dad, somebody I look up to,” Gregorek said. “The whole family was pretty excited about it. I hear about all the great things my dad did before I was born and when I was young and it’s cool to add to his legacy and maybe start one of my own at the same time.” \nNext up, the junior Gregorek is racing the mile again at the USATF Indoor Championships, which begin on Friday in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \n“We’re prepared for anything as a team,” he said. “We’re all looking for top three places. We’re gonna go for it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:38:20.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
