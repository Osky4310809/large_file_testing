Afterwards, the participants’ penises slowly rebounded. By the time they reached the 12-month benchmark, their penis lengths were not significantly different from before they had their prostatectomies. (Find out the average penis size for men .) \nPreviously, animal studies suggested that the penis shortening could be due to damage to the cavernosal nerve in the penis, or structural alterations as a result of oxygen deficiencies during the procedure, the researchers wrote. \nBut now, they think something else might be playing a role in the penis shortening. MRI tests showed that the end of the participants’ urethras actually moved inward to the pelvis after the prostate removal. This takes the bulb, or the base of the penis, along with it, causing it to appear shorter. \nOver the course of the year, though, the connective tissue holding the pelvic organs in place begins to loosen. As a result, the urethra—and the base of the penis—return to their original position. And that’s likely why penis lengths don’t seem to be any shorter one year after the procedure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:39:43.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
