Azuka, you are in truly sparkling form this morning hammerhouseofhorror \nJonathan has never and can never lay claim to a “Mandela Momentum”. Jonathan’s Momentum is in the Reverse Order. His movement is permanently on the reverse gear. Gboye \nI want to believe that our president was then a student without shoes. He had no knowledge of all this you are saying. The cowboys around him are as well clueless. \nI hope uncle Jona will learn a lesson from this event. seni \nvery well said, only if people like linda ikeji could even post this types of things on her blog , to be of more use to the Nigerian youth……smh Ezeh Princewill \nMandela died ….so the response by Nigerian government is a yardstick to blame GEJ… Must you turn everything to politics???will that put food on the table of common man?where are your senses you this azuka boy? is it by wearing suit and posing on newspaper? please blame on something more meaningful to the development of all Nigerians including you .No disrespect to great Madiba ! Easy \nHi Princewill, I’m sure if you read this set piece slowly with a positive attitude, you will definitely understand it much better. The writer isn’t talking politics, rather he emphasize on taking opportunity when it arises. Common man you talk about can’t leave by food alone ok. \nDid you ask yourself while the U.S. delegates attending the ceremony include President Barack Obama along with 26 Congress members and with every living U.S. president with the sole exception of George H W Bush? and the Canadian delegates including Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, along with former Canadian Prime Ministers Kim Campbell, Jean Chretien and Brian Mulroney. Joe Clark, another ex PM of Canada, joining the Canadian delegation from the Ivory Coast where he has been on a mission promoting democracy? Mandela isn’t an ordinarily man, and if he is, he definitely stays in the kitchen when the pressure was high. So with due respect to your opinion this type of memorial comes once in a decade, and every words from the writer is absolutely right. We need a positive attitude from every Nigerian to get it working in the right paths. Cheers. delemayo \nThis is what I posted on my twitter handle immediately Obama finished addressing the media.” Bamidele OJO, FCA [email protected] Dec Where is GEJ the President of the most populous black Nation to address Nigerians and Africa on the demise of Great Nelson “Madiba” Mandela” Alex \nAzuka, brilliant piece as usual. These sorts of events keep exposing how shallow-brained our current leaders are. It is just amazing that no one is government (as many as they are), think along these lines! If they cannot, what the heck are they doing there? Imagine if Mandela’s death occurred during the Murtala/Obasanjo regime, the whole world would have thought that Mandela was Nigerian going by what the Nigerian government would have done. Ezeh Princewill \nJames and azuka equals rubbish..you have an agenda.of what good is ur callous actions.think of your 6feet? it come one day steve \nNah wah o, how did we end up like this? Jojo \nWords fail me in efforts to express d lack of wisdom and diplomacy of the Nigerian leadership. Azuka u are on point. Thank u very much. I just hope they will learn Tanko \nThis is the rubbish fresh air, the president is highly confused, however some nonesense, who are by far worst than him, keep on encouraging him and telling him he is always right. Look at this mumu Sambo! They are dumb and brainless people. But most people dont like the bitter truth. Quasim Ademola \nAbati is one of the enemies of mr,president. Sad Nigerian \nThis is the best article i have read this year. Every line of this article is a conversation i have had with South Africans or fellow Nigerians. Thank you for speaking my mind. I feel like i wrote this piece myself. Except of course, i am not as good s writer as you. Thank you for reminding us of how our influence has waned in every aspect, particularly on the global scene. farooq \n“Sadly, Jonathan lost the Mandela momentum” \ndid he even have it in the first place? \nyou don’t loose what you don’t have .. m \nWhat’s the point in this article in relation to Nigeria being prepared for a man to die before we prove our-self… does it mean that those that were prepared wanted him to die or that they want to use it to prove their assertiveness? tonireal \nGoodluck Jonathan and his drunkard friends know next to nothing about governmance.
