This story was no different. The petty animosity between Lucas and Daisy was hilarious and addictive to read about, knowing both characters were incredibly attracted to one another. Their banter and insults thrown at one another as they both try to rise to the top of a doctor‚Äôs practice in their hometown completely sucked me in. Yet again, R.S. Grey wrote another novel full of angst The hate-to-love trope in romance novels is my favorite plot device, and I will never get tired of it being used. This story was no different. The petty animosity between Lucas and Daisy was hilarious and addictive to read about, knowing both characters were incredibly attracted to one another. Their banter and insults thrown at one another as they both try to rise to the top of a doctor‚Äôs practice in their hometown completely sucked me in. Yet again, R.S. Grey wrote another novel full of angst that I devoured in one day. One major thing that jumped out to me from the beginning was how much I loved Daisy‚Äôs internal monologue. R.S. Grey is always flawless at creating such a conversational and relatable narrator that helped me fall into the lives of Daisy and Lucas. While I liked Daisy and her quirky Ravenclaw-esque personality, I adored Lucas who was such a sweet love interest that I wished had a larger POV in the story. The story would have felt much more complete and could have held more depth if Lucas‚Äô POV was offered. It felt like the story was one sided, only seeing it from Daisy‚Äôs eyes, and I wished Lucas was able to offer more of their history they shared together. He was such a heartwarming character, and I wanted him to have more time to share his side of the story and his love for Daisy. Daisy‚Äôs relationship with Lucas was such a fun aspect of the book that I loved. Their tension and chemistry flowed off the pages and kept me glued to the book in hopes of them getting together soon. I was obsessed with their dialogue and interactions and the glimpses into their past that was shown through their discussions and recollections that side characters offered. The thing that really kept me from truly loving this story was how immature and stubborn Daisy was at times. I wanted to shake her and yell, ‚ÄúKiss him!‚Äù every time she spoke to Lucas because it was so clear that she loved him and refused to admit it. At times her dislike for him irked me, but her character development towards the end of the novel made up for that flaw a bit. While it seemed a bit rushed, her realization of the mistakes she made helped resolve the issues I had with her character majority of the time. As always, I loved R.S. Grey‚Äôs newest romance story. She always creates such funny characters and plot lines that suck me in and help me lose myself in the romances she creates. This story was no different. While I didn‚Äôt enjoy Daisy‚Äôs character as much and wished that Lucas offered more to the story, I still enjoyed reading it. This is the perfect weekend romance that you can finish in a day or two because it‚Äôs such a lovely hate-to-love novel. ...more Feb 02, 2017 Vanessa (nessreads) rated it really liked it *ARC received for an honest review*4.5 stars!Anything You Can Do was exactly the book I needed at exactly the right time.

Humorous, witty, enemies-to-lovers. Just an all-around enjoyable book.\"Roses are red. Daisy is you. I heard you came back, and I did too.\"Daisy, a doctor, returns home to Hamilton to start a new job. She's surprised to know that her arch nemesis, Lucas Thatcher, also a doctor has come home too. Daisy is taken aback when she finds out that her enemy will also be working at the same place she is. \"You haven‚Äôt changed one bit,\" he finally says. \"Really? Because you‚Äôve gotten much worse.\" \"You're probably right.\" It's no secret that Daisy and Lucas don't like each other. Any chance they get they do what they can to get on each other's nerves. The banter between these two is hilarious and their comebacks are just laugh-out-loud funny. And don't even get me started on the tension that is downright obvious. It's not a question of IF they, but it's definitely WHEN will they give-in.\"Can you kill someone with a kiss?

He made me swoon and sigh so many times. Forget Dr. McDreamy and McSteamy, if ever I need mouth-to-mouth I want Dr. Tall NiceAss. *wink*\"I love you, which seems crazy because up until about four days ago, I really thought I hated you. But when you think about it, love and hate aren‚Äôt so very different, right? To love someone is to strive to be a better person for them, and isn‚Äôt that what our hateful little competition has been about the whole time?\"R.S. Grey knows how to write romantic comedies and she does it to a T. She has a talent of making you laugh hysterically and at the same time swoon and smile big that make your cheeks hurt. R.S. is and will always be one of favorite authors. There isn't a book of hers I've read that I didn't like and no matter what she writes I'm positive I'll enjoy. Anything You Can Do is no different, it was such a fun book to read. I highly recommend it. ...more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:58:57.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
