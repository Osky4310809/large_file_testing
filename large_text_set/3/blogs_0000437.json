Beauty and destruction: the Amazon rainforest – in pictures Read more \nLocal farmers carried out the forest-burning to grow soybeans for Burger King’s suppliers Cargill and Bunge, the only two agricultural traders known to be operating in the area. \nGlenn Hurowitz, Mighty Earth ’s CEO, said: “The connections are quite clear. Bunge and Cargill supply Burger King and other big meat sellers with grain. McDonald’s , Subway and KFC are not perfect but they’re doing a hell of a lot more to protect the forests. If Burger King does not respond immediately to people who want to know where their food comes from, then people should shop elsewhere.” \nThe destruction of tropical forest and savannah land highlighted in the report is concentrated in Bolivia’s lowland forests and in the Brazilian Cerrado , where the pace of deforestation is now outstripping that of the Amazon. \nOne of Burger King’s suppliers buys soy from Bunge that originates in the Brazilian Cerrado, according to commodities data provided by the Stockholm Enterprise Institute. \nCargill has also sponsored Burger King’s annual convention in 2015, and donated a five-figure sum to the Burger King McLamore Foundation in 2014. \nLast year, nearly 2m hectares of land was deforested in Brazil – up from 1.5m in 2015 – while an estimated 865,000 hectares of forest was cleared in Bolivia , compared to 667,000 a year in the 2000s.

The fast food giant needs to follow its competitors like McDonald’s and demand that its suppliers are not destroying tropical forests as part of their business model.” \nThe fast food giant, which operates at least one joint venture with Cargill, declined to respond to requests for comment. Will McDonald's ‘sustainable beef’ burgers really be any better?

Today, we are working with more than 15,000 soy farmers and collaborating with governments, NGOs and partners to implement the Brazilian forest code and advance forest protection.” \nCampaigners counter that Cargill has refused to extend the soy moratorium beyond the Amazon, with its trade association citing the lack of a “crisis situation”. \nBurge also did not respond to requests for comment. \nMore than half of the Cerrado’s natural vegetation has already been cleared, compared to 25% of the Amazon’s. \nInvestors representing $617bn of assets on Tuesday sent a letter to Cargill, Bunge and several burger chains, in which they “demand that companies reaffirm and extend zero deforestation commitments specific to Latin America”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:25:24.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
