Under their contracts, they had to wait until a replacement member was found. They would then receive their membership deposits back. Until then, they were still obligated to pay dues but had access to the club.\nTrump demanded they still pay dues but denied them access.\nHis organization released a statement saying it disagrees with the ruling and plans to appeal.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:56:24.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
