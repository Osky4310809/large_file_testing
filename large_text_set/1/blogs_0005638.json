The 6-foot-6 senior led his team with three 3-pointers. \n“I’ve been shooting that in AAU since about my sophomore year. I just never had to shoot it because we always had shooters on the team,” Bohannon said. \nBohannon’s first three of the game sparked a 12-2 run in the first quarter to give Lorain the lead for good. \nNo. 13 Maple Heights (7-2, 1-1) cut the deficit to one in the second quarter but couldn't draw even. The Titans pushed the tempo and tried to wear down the Mustangs. \n“I thought we came out a little slow to start the game,” Rositano said. “We forced them into a lot of very difficult shots. And that’s what very good defensive teams do is force the other team’s players into difficult shots. And they make guys that normally don’t score start shooting the basketball. I thought that’s what happened as the game wore on.” \nSophomore guard Devone Grant provided a major boost off the bench for Lorain with 18 points, seven rebounds and a blocked shot. Grant, who had 17 points earlier this season against Oberlin, has relied on the support of the upperclassmen on the team while he finds his role. \n“They’ve just boosted me up and just kept me going, and keep my confidence high,” Grant said. “I also just keep that in my mind as well to just stay positive.” \nLorain’s win came three days after the Titans held off No. 4 Garfield Heights, 66-64 . Lorain prevented Garfield Heights from attempting a game-winning shot at the buzzer. \n“I’ll be honest. We were concerned,” Rositano said. “It took a lot out of both teams I think, the energy, the emotion. It was a concern coming back against a really good team. Like I said, after we settled into the game in the first three or four minutes, I thought we did a good job of getting that energy back and took out a very, really good Maple Heights team.” \nFonse Hale led Maple Heights with 19 points, but had only six in the second half. \nLorain travels to Warrensville Heights on Jan. 13, and Maple Heights will play at Youngstown Cardinal Mooney on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:09:12.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
