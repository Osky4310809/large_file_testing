She said her mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in January and recently had surgery, she’s been recovering at home ever since. 2 \nHer parents, Jim and Laura have been married for 26 years, but Jim wanted to do something extra special for his wife. He proposed to her for a second time to remind her he’s with her through the good and bad, in sickness and in health. \nChristin said her mom was so surprised and happy she started crying every time she looked at her new ring. Her new wedding ring still has the diamonds from her original band. \nAfter the proposal Christin’s mom said, “This is what true love really is, even when I look like this he still loves me. As unattractive as I feel right now I can’t believe I deserve something so beautiful.” \nChristin posted a few pictures of her parents on Twitter after the proposal and people loved it. 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:10:58.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
