Announced on Wednesday, the charges of wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft could carry a sentence of 20 years in prison.

They then sent phishing emails to representatives of the major tech firms, which regularly “conducted multimillion dollar transactions” with the manufacturer. The American firms followed the email instructions and wired tens of millions of dollars to bank accounts in Lithuania , Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Hungary and Hong Kong. \nRimasauskas also forged letters, invoices, corporate stamps and contracts in the name of executives of his target companies, and tried to disguise the flow of money through bank accounts in the United States, according to prosecutors. His fraudulent company, authorities said, had a board of directors that consisted of one man: Rimasauskas. \n“This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies – even the most sophisticated – that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cyber criminals,” acting US attorney Joon Kim said in a statement. \nIn its court documents, prosecutors did not name either the “victim companies” or the manufacturer that Rimasauskas allegedly impersonated. That company was “established in or about the late 1980s”, prosecutors said, and provides “goods and services to various technology companies around the world”. \nOne of the American victim companies was described as a “multinational technology company, specializing in internet-related services and products”. The second was described as “a multinational corporation providing online social media and networking services”. Both “regularly engaged in multimillion dollar transactions” with the Asian manufacturer, authorities said.

But Rimasauskas left a “footprint”, Sweeney said, that “would eventually lead investigators to the truth”. \nThe justice department did not comment on possible extradition, but said the case had been assigned to a US district judge.
