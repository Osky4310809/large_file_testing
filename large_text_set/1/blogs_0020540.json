It had previously teased the fix via a beta release, regaining Consumer Reports ' seal of approval .\nSEE ALSO: Apple's software has been anything but 'magical' lately\nThis isn't the first macOS update Apple has released since the company unveiled the new laptop. An update in December saw the removal of the \"time remaining\" estimates for the battery. Their reasonings behind getting rid of this feature remains unclear, though some sources suspected that it was because their time predictions were inaccurate.\nAlso included in today's update: improved automatic graphics switching on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which will put the discrete graphics on ice when you're not fragging zombies, this saving power. Specifically, the update also \"resolved graphic issues while encoding Adobe Premiere Pro Projects\" on the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro with TouchBar.\nApple may have escaped the Consumer Reports blacklist, but it's doubtful today's tweaks will put an end to complaining about the MacBook Pro. For now though, Apple has made at least some users happy .\nBONUS: Castle 3-D printed in concrete spells new era in architecture", "external_links": ["http://www.techradar.com/news/apple-macbook-pro-earns-consumer-reports-recommendation-after-battery-bug-fix", "https://9to5mac.com/2016/12/13/why-apple-is-removing-time-remaining-battery-life-estimates-macbook-pro/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/5Jom6Qqk.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/5Jom6Qqk.m3u8", "https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5h0kjh/2016_macbook_pro_battery_complaints_grow_for_both/"], "published": "2017-01-25T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:37:01.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
