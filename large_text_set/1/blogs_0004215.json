CES 2017: Xiaomi introduces a white variant of the bezel-less Mi MIX smartphone By - January 6, 2017 “The innovative Mi MIX flagship will now be available in black and white hues in China” \nIn October last year, Xiaomi introduced the Mi MIX , a powerful smartphone with an almost bezel-less design, an all-ceramic body, and a 91.3 percent screen-to-body ratio. Designed by popular designer Philippe Starck, the Mi MIX was only available in a single black hue since launch. However, at CES in Las Vegas, the company has introduced a new white variant of the device. \nXiaomi’s Global VP Hugo Barra unveiled the new white Mi MIX, and said that the phone will be available in China later this year. The company didn’t announce the pricing of the new variant, but we expect it to be priced the same as the black model. Apart from a new white hue, the design and features of the new model are similar to the black edition. \nFor the uninitiated, the Xiaomi Mi MIX features a 6.4-inch display with a resolution of 2,040 x 1,080 pixels. The device is powered by a 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, mated to 4GB or 6GB of RAM. It comes with a 16MP rear snapper with PDAF and a dual-tone LED flash, and a 5MP selfie shooter. Its other specs include a beefy 4,400mAh battery with fast charging support, 128GB of storage, a fingerprint sensor, a USB Type-C port, 4G LTE, and Android Marshmallow.
