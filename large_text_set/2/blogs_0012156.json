And, as he's also discovered, they bite.\nThe debacle over national security advisor Michael Flynn's sudden departure over his ill-advised contacts with Russian government officials shows that the Democrats in Congress and the bureaucrats that work with them mean to take as many scalps and do as much damage possible to Trump's barely 3-weeks-old presidency.\nIf they can fatally damage him early in his first term, all the better.\nAnd they have help. The media have been slobbering at the chance to slip their chains and take a bite out of Trump, who has so far bested them in Twitter battles and, worse, made them irrelevant to a large segment of the population.\nMeanwhile, federal bureaucrats, fearing Trump's vow to shrink big government and root out corruption, are digging in as if fighting for their very lives. That's why intelligence \"sources,\" as the media call them, are willing to break the law to subvert Trump's administration. They have too much to lose if he wins.\nThat's why Flynn's resignation was like red meat to both the politicians and the progressive-left mainstream media. Already, Trump's foes in politics and the media are calling for a \"bipartisan 9/11 style\" investigation, and likening it to past heinous political crimes. Claims made by unnamed intelligence sources that not only Flynn but other Trump campaign aides and officials had numerous contacts with Russian officials have led to not-so-subtle suggestions of criminal behavior.\nAnd, with their constant references to Watergate, Trump's foes are singing from the same hymnal.\n\"This is bigger than Watergate,\" according to a release from the Democratic National Committee.\n\"The parallels here to Watergate are eerie,\" asserted former Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook.\n\"Watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime, until maybe now,\" former CBS anchor Dan Rather wrote on his Facebook page.\n\"In the end, Nixon had to quit. I believe Trump will meet a similar fate ,\" said liberal Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen, also likening Trump's situation to Richard Nixon's Watergate travails.\nBut wait, as they say in late-night infomercials, there's more.\n\"This is already bigger than Watergate,\" said Zac Petkanas, a former Clinton campaign official in a statement.\nBigger than Watergate? Trump's adversaries are saying, without any evidence that the law was broken, that it's worse than Watergate, one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. No one quite knows what these contacts were, but even the New York Times admitted there was no evidence of a crime.\nAnd aren't these the same people who couldn't be bothered by one of the biggest political scandals ever — the IRS' targeting of Tea Party groups, using taxpayer money to subvert American democracy? What about Fast and Furious, the ATF's scheme to let thousands of weapons to be sold illegally to the drug cartels? Those weapons ended up killing innocent people, including U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Or the Veterans Affairs scandal and cover-up of thousands of veterans suffering from inadequate care or dying, because they were put on interminable waiting lists in our one true nationalized health care system?\nBy the way, those going after Trump seem ready to break the law if necessary to do the job. Publicly revealing official U.S. signals intelligence, lefty journalist Glenn Greenwald reminds us, \" is one of the most serious felonies \" involving classified information. And Greenwald, quoting the Washington Post, notes that no fewer than nine \"current and former officials at multiple agencies at the time of the calls\" helped spread the information.\nThese are real crimes — not imaginary ones.\nTalk of Watergate-style crimes is way overblown, but that doesn't mean it will blow over. The so-called Deep State, the semi-permanent class of politicians, bureaucrats, lobbyists and contractors who make a grand living off the taxpayers, have a vested interest in taking down Trump. He's the real enemy, not the Russians. And, even if it means breaking the law, that's just what these Swamp People mean to do.\nRELATED: \nWhat Should Trump Do?
