This is why we positively melted at Jamie Lynn Spears’s Valentine’s pic of her daughter Maddie , who was in the news recently after a devastating ATV accident .\nThe photo shows Maddie smiling, displaying some chocolate bars wrapped in homemade, custom wrappers that she passed out to classmates. Jamie Lynn escorted her 8-year-old daughter to school to hand them out, seeing as Maddie will not actually attend her classes for a little while longer. After the accident left Maddie in a coma for two days, seeing her happy smile is the sweetest Valentine yet.\nWe’ve officially decided that we firmly believe that Mother/Daughter Valentines are the best of all. Maddie isn't quite ready to return to school, but her doctors did clear her to bring in her Valentine's Day treats to her class today. Thanks to @avery and @hersheycompany for making these treats for her to pass out, since I didn't have the time to make any myself this year. It made her so happy to see her friends, and be able to give them such cute treats. It was a great moment for us after everything that has happened. We are so thankful to celebrate Valentine's Day with the ones we love, and we don't take a second of it for granted ❤️Happy Valentine's Day❤️ \nA post shared by Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) on Feb 14, 2017 at 12:50pm PST \n“Maddie isn’t quite ready to return to school, but her doctors did clear her to bring in her Valentine’s Day treats to her class today.” Jamie Lynn captioned the pic of her daughter in a fuzzy pink sweater (remember Aunt Britney’s fuzzy pink pigtail pompoms in “…Baby One More Time”? Do you think they were, ahem, cut from the same cloth ?).\n“We are so thankful to celebrate Valentine’s Day with the ones we love, and we don’t take a second of it for granted,” said the young mom, who obviously is over the moon with her daughter’s recovery. With some time and rest, we’re positive Maddie will be back in school in no time.\nJamie Lynn posted this thankful post during the more hopeful days following her daughter’s serious accident: February 11th #JesusAlways \nA post shared by Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) on Feb 11, 2017 at 11:25am PST \nAccording to the police report obtained by People , “Maddie was driving an ATV within view of Spears, 25, and her husband Jamie Watson when she took a hard right to avoid running over a nearby drainage ditch, causing the vehicle to ‘ enter [ a] pond’,” where Maddie was submerged under water and held down by the seatbelt of the vehicle. She was shortly rescued by the Acadian Ambulance Services.\nThanks to the amazing first responders, and medical teams at University and Children's Hospital in New Orleans, LA, we are headed home with our baby girl as she continues to recover. Above all else we are so thankful for each and every prayer, because we know that is what truly made the difference. Thank you again to everyone. We are truly blessed \nA post shared by Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) on Feb 10, 2017 at 11:28am PST \nOur thoughts are with Maddie and family as she recovers. More smiling Instagrams, please! We love knowing that her life will soon be back to normal!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:25:31.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
