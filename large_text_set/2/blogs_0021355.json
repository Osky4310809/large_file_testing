Ryan Blaney finished second, followed by AJ Allmendinger, Aric Almirola and Paul Menard.\nBusch passed Kyle Larson with two laps remaining to score his first victory in NASCAR”s biggest race. It was the first Daytona 500 win for the 2004 Cup Series champion and the first for car owner Tony Stewart, who retired after the 2016 season following an illustrious career but never having won the Daytona 500 in 17 attempts.\nA succession of multi-car accidents just past halfway sent several contenders to the garage early, and changed the complexion of the race. \nThe carnage began when Kyle Busch’s blown right-front tire sent him spinning into Matt Kenseth and Erik Jones, and left Dale Earnhardt Jr. with no path to avoid the trio. All four drivers retired and were released from the infield care center after undergoing a medical evaluation.\nThirteen laps after Busch’s tire sent him spinning, a 16-car accident further whittled down the field . This time the carnage started when Jamie McMurray turned defending Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson entering Turn 3, blocking the track and causing the field to pileup.
