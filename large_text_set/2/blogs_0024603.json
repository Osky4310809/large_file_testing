This young man’s first name was Obu. His last name was Obu. And his middle name? You guessed it, Obu. Not only that, but the Obu family were singers, and sang Harvey a song about being on Feud . It was Celebrity Charity Week on The Price Is Right , and the week kicked off with the best “come on down” moment in recent memory when Jack Black made an appearance. Black completed his epic entrance by hugging and kissing a gentleman in the front row. Also on The Price Is Right , a contestant was about 10 years late guessing the price of an item when she said, “Two thousand, Bob.” The current host, Drew Carey, then introduced himself to the young lady. And on Jeopardy! , Alex Trebek once again showed off his rapping skills, which only seem to get better every time he demonstrates them.
