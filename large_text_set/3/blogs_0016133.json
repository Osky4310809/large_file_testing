The artist took his current boo, Selena Gomez, to his hometown of Toronto, where the couple spent their date night at Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada. \nThe Weeknd took to Instagram to document his adventure, posting photos and videos on his timeline as well as on his story. Who is that spinning in a glass enclosure? Selena, of course! How about that small human sitting in front of a wall of jellyfish? Also Selena!\n[New | Video]: Selena in The Weeknd’s Instagram Story. pic.twitter.com/zgYqZpP8oD \n— Selena Gomez News (@LifeWithSelG) March 19, 2017 Selena hasn’t posted anything on her Instagram about the aquarium, but we’re sure she was enjoying herself. After all, the aquarium boasts everything from a “dangerous lagoon” where you can walk under a dome of glass that separates you from sharks, fish, and stingrays, to a “rainbow reef” that features over 100 species of fish.\n\nA post shared by The Weeknd (@theweeknd) on Mar 19, 2017 at 1:25pm PDT \nAlthough this date seems original, we have to be the bearer of bad news and say Drake did it first! And at the same exact aquarium! Drake took Rihanna to the aquarium last fall; apparently he booked out the place Sunday night, which meant personalized aquarium fun until the early hours of the morning. Regardless, we’re still hype for The Weeknd and Selena.\nA post shared by @rebeccajamesdsm on Mar 20, 2017 at 2:52pm PDT \nThe date was their first after returning home from Europe, where The Weekend had a few shows (which Selena attended in the name of love and support). We’re crossing our fingers that there are more envy-worthy dates for us to lust over in the near future.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:50:32.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
