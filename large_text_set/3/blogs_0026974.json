Chicago, which inked Mike Glennon to a three-year, $43.5 million contract two weeks ago, now has the veteran Sanchez to back him up after letting eight-year starter Jay Cutler walk this offseason.\nSanchez adds to a largely underwhelming Bears depth chart. Glennon is expected to take over the starting job after playing only 21 games in his career and compiling a 5-13 record over 18 starts. Sanchez, who began his NFL career with the Jets, has played just 15 games since 2014 while bouncing between the Eagles, Broncos and Cowboys. Second-year quarterback Conor Shaw and practice-squad mainstay David Fales round out the Bears’ options.\nSanchez, 30, may be on his last leg in the league after another season marred by turnovers. Appearing in two games with the Cowboys in 2016, Sanchez completed 10 of 18 passes and threw two interceptions.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:53:09.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
