While many gravitate toward King’s “I Have a Dream” speech in order to highlight his hopes, his “Letter From a Birmingham Jail” feels more applicable to the way things are right now, especially in light of the incoming U.S. Presidential administration. I came across this awesome reading of King’s letter by staff at The Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University that really brings home the power and purpose of King’s message. That yes, he believed in non-violent action, but he also understood that politeness and “waiting for the right time” were things that were never going to work for the black community, or any community that is oppressed. He wrote: \n“I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can’t agree with your methods of direct action’; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ‘more convenient season.’ Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.” \nLet’s remember this today, tomorrow, and beyond. \nAlso worth checking out: In totally appropriate fashion, Hidden Figures dominated the box office on this Martin Luther King, Jr. Day weekend.
