He generally hasn’t gotten involved publicly with politics. \nBut like everyone else, Wilson had an opinion on President Donald Trump. Wilson, in a Facebook Live video as he got his hair cut (h/t to @hwkbgr for tweeting it), said he voted for Hillary Clinton but added that no matter who you voted for people should be questioning Trump’s actions as president. \n“This thing is getting out of hand … It’s only been what, two weeks? Or even less than that?” Wilson said. “We have to attack this issue here. \n“It’s already affecting people’s hearts and souls and lives, in such a negative way in my opinion,” Wilson said. “You go to LAX airport and there’s people all over the place fighting for their lives and protesting and all of that … All the protests that have gone on through African-American communities, and Muslim communities too.
