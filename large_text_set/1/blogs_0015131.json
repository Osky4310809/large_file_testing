Picture Chris Pavlich \nShe would seem like a breath of fresh air after “Casino Mike” spent the past years losing his popularity, lambasted for curtailing Sydney’s night-life and for the heavily criticised light rail, WestConnex and Sydney Metro projects. \nAs transport minister, Ms Berejiklian spoke out against the government’s handling of trains, buses and ferries and was behind the introduction of the Opal card. \nShe has a graduate diploma in international studies from the University of Sydney and a Masters in Commerce from the University of New South Wales. media_camera NSW Premier Mike Baird is quitting politics after a tricky year. \n“Serving as premier of NSW has been a tremendous honour, but I have made clear from the beginning that I was in politics to make a difference, and then move on. After 10 years in public life, this moment for me has arrived,” he said in a statement. \n“Next week there will be a Liberal Party room meeting and a spill of leadership positions. Following that meeting, I will resign from parliament, effective immediately. \n“I am immensely proud of what Barry O’Farrell and I — together with Andrew Stoner, Troy Grant, John Barilaro and our teams — have achieved over the past six years,” he said. \nMr Baird will hold a media conference in Sydney at 10am. \n— With wires", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:07:33.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
