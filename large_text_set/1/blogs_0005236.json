The moment she heard her name called as a winner, she was clinging to her handler as she was also waiting to be called to do a production number during the awards night. \n“I was jumping and shouting and they told me, go out there and accept your trophy,” Phoebe recalled in our interview the other day at Starbuck’s Coffee of Imperial Palace Hotel in Quezon City. \n“I am so happy with the win. But I was shocked. I didn’t expect it. I sent Direk Erik a message with a picture of me holding the trophy and told him this award would not have been possible if not for his trust in me. Direk Erik said he was proud of me and he hopes to see me when he gets back from his New York trip next week. That will be the first time we will be seeing each other after I won.” \nPhoebe says she was already so thrilled when she heard her name called as one of the nominees. She quietly told herself she had a chance but she did not really entertain thoughts of winning. That was why when she accepted her trophy, she just sort of blabbered in her speech. And she was not even wearing her gown as she was set to do a production number. \n“When Christian Bables (Best Supporting Actor winner for ‘Die Beautiful’) became emotional in his speech, I told myself na in case manalo ako, I don’t want to cry. Nakakahiya. Siya na lang ang umiyak for both of us in case I win. I wanted to dedicate the moment to those people who helped me achieve that win but just the same, I forgot to dedicate my award to my family. Oh my gosh!,” she says, laughing. \nHas she recovered from the euphoria of winning? “Hindi pa rin. In the morning of the awards night, I was feeling kind of nervous but I didn’t know where it was coming from. Siguro dahil sa mga nababasa ko na I might win an award because they thought I did well in my role. They said I deserve a recognition. So I said baka my chance so Lord baka ibigay mo sa akin ito. Sobrang magandang blessing. When I woke up the next day, I had many supporters online congratulating me. Pati parents ko abroad, they were so happy,” said Phoebe as her voice cracked and her eyes turned misty. Freeman ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: \n“It was such a huge blessing. It is my first festival movie, my first nomination and then I won,” added Phoebe who just renewed her contract with Viva Entertainment for five years even before she won her first award. \nShe is aware that people will be more critical of her now that she won but Phoebe vows to work even harder in improving her craft as she wants to stay long in the business. *** \nAt the presscon of “Mang Kepweng Returns,” Vhong Navarro was asked if he has plans of settling down with his longtime partner. After all, some of his co-hosts in “It’s Showtime” had just gotten engaged. \nBut Vhong says he was the very first among his peers to have tied the knot when he was only 21 to former actress Bianca Lapuz. That marriage is already annulled and Vhong is free to marry his longtime partner. He said he is just taking care of some matters but he is surely marrying his partner soon. \n“I don’t want to get married in haste. I want to plan my marriage carefully. The woman whom I am with now loved me with her heart and soul, unconditionally and I want to give her the most beautiful wedding possible,” he said. \nVhong added that his partner had stood by him in all of his trials. Whatever he wants to do, his partner supports him wholeheartedly. That is why he wants to marry her in style. \n“I don’t want to rush into marriage just because my friends are doing so. Ayoko lang nung dahil uso, gumaya tayo. There is a right timing for everything. I don’t know yet if we will get married this year or next year. There will be a wedding and since this is my second marriage, I want everything to be proper and in place. I really want to give my partner the best wedding that I can give her.” \nHe said many of today’s comedians are hoping to play roles popularized by Papang Chiquito and he considers himself fortunate to have been chosen to play Mang Kepweng in the retelling of one of the country’s iconic screen characters. He said it would have been better if “Mang Kepweng Returns” made it to the MMFF but Vhong is still thankful that the movie’s opening day coincided with his birthday. \nAlthough he didn’t have the chance to work with Chiquito in the past, through the aid of technology, he got to interact with Chiquito onscreen in one of the scenes in the movie. \nVhong also says that he hopes to have approximated the kind of acting that Chiquito did as Mang Kepweng. “Sabi nila Direk nagawa ko naman daw,” he added. *** \nAppearing as guests in “Bubble Gang” tonight are Carla Abellana and Jackie Woo. Featured segments are Duguan sa Pinto gags, Big Time Extra (Bitoy plays a well-known talent “extra” acting like a diva on the set of a new film), Center Island (a group of people fighting over a property), PWD sa Ilong (Betong confronts Bitoy for parking his car at the handicapped parking spot), My Husband’s Dubber (Valeen Montenegro introduces her Japanese husband to her friend), Balitang Ina (Chariz Solomon and Valeen host a show tackling motherhood) and Sick Senses (Bitoy explains the side effects of eye surgery to Jackie Woo).
