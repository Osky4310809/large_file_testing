Rangy and gravel-voiced, with a Harvard law degree, a telecommunications fortune and a stately suburban home in the Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria, Va., Mr. Warner reached the governor’s mansion in 2002 as a pro-business Democrat who found unlikely success with the kinds of rural voters who last year elevated Mr. Trump. He sponsored a local Nascar team, dabbled in turkey hunting and added a bluegrass campaign theme song . “Get ready to shout it from the coal mines to the stills,” the lyrics went. “Here comes Mark Warner, the hero of the hills.” \nAdvertisement   After a popular term as governor, a possible 2008 presidential run was aborted before it began, punctured by some halting moments on the precampaign circuit. (If a cellphone went off in the crowd while he was speaking, Mr. Warner, a co-founder of the company that became Nextel, would joke that all he heard was “ka-ching, ka-ching.”) Since then, after a landslide Senate victory in 2008, he has slogged through life in the Senate with few signature achievements, never quite finding his moment. \nAdvertisement Persistent vice-presidential speculation amounted to little, with Mr. Kaine instead getting the most recent call to round out a Democratic ticket. \nAdvertisement   By the time Mr. Warner came up for re-election to the Senate in 2014, he eked out a victory by less than a point. Months before the vote, he was asked at a county fair how he was doing. His response: “You know where I work.” \nAdvertisement   Now given a task befitting his ambitions, Mr. Warner is plainly relishing the role, suggesting his profile as a moderate — Mr. Warner once had an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association — was at last serving a political purpose on the national stage. “There have been some times when I’ve been put in kind of ‘timeout’ for being too bipartisan,” he said during a 40-minute interview last week in his Senate office, sipping acai-blueberry pomegranate Vitaminwater from a plastic cup. “Man alive, you cannot make this partisan.” Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
