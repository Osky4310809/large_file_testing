ID: 10266546 I wish The Boondocks was still around to make a parody episode of this whole soulja boy situation.\n— Favriel (@foreignhoney) ID: 102 4. We’ll quickly catch you up on this “Soulja Boy situation” if you haven’t been following. Like all great sagas, it started with an Instagram like. Maury Phillips / Getty Images\nPascal Le Segretain / Getty Images\n On Monday, Soulja Boy claimed that Chris Brown ragged on him for “liking” one of Karrueche’s Instagram photos , which sparked a very strange, but impassioned, beef between the two that exhaustedly played out all over social media.\nBut then, one day later, as Soulja Boy hosted an Instagram Live video in Compton, a heated exchange between a resident and the rapper was captured when the resident accused him of not being “from the hood.” Soulja’s phone was eventually knocked to the ground. More footage that surfaced from the altercation showed him trying to square off with the local residents and retrieve his phone back.\nOf course, Chris Brown took this opportunity to clown his opponent . But by Wednesday, it seemed Soulja Boy was ready to toss in the towel. He posted an apology on Twitter, and said his mom was the one who encouraged him to say sorry.\nBut then , in devastatingly sad timing, pro boxer Adrien Broner posted a flyer on Instagram announcing that Soulja and Brown were going to literally box this out .\nID: 10266810 5. Oh, and amid his apology, people couldn’t stop laughing at Soulja for saying his mom has been with him “since [he] was born.” Soulja boy say \"my mom been with me since I was born\". Lmao shittt me too bro\n— LUCKI (@LUCKI6BELOW) ID: 10267076 @souljaboy \"She always been there since I've been born\"\n— ♛ (@LAKE ) ID: 10267085 7. This is all to say that it has been a deeply, deeply unfortunate start to the new year for our friend. Still, people couldn’t help but be entertained. I don't wanna hear nothin Soulja boy got to say for the rest of the year 😂😂\n— Mo Bands™ (@NikesN_Chixks) ID: 10267095 Soulja boy vs the entire rap community\n— Shishou 🌐 (@OmonaKami) (Oh yeah, a bunch of rappers also couldn’t help themselves from laughing at the mess.)\nID: 10267112 you ever feel like ur having a bad day, then you think to yourself it could be worse, I could be soulja boy\n— ㅤ (@TrapHouseFu) ID: 10267142 Soulja Boy just broke the world record for most consecutive Ls in 24 hours and he's still going.
