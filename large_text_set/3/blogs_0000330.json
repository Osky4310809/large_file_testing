(Photo: LM Otero, AP) 252   \nNo matter what side of the DeMarcus Cousins debate you were on in Sacramento, there was always one indisputable reality about his six-plus season tenure with the Kings: It was exhausting. \nFrom the day he stepped foot in California’s Capitol as a 19-year-old and started clashing with then-coach Paul Westphal to the rainy night when he held back tears and said goodbye to a room full of supporters inside a sushi restaurant just outside the city limits, the Cousins experience was always an emotional roller coaster. \nFans who loved him despite his mercurial ways were never truly rewarded. Cousins’ monstrous individual production always came amid abject failure and dysfunction (a 35.3 winning percentage in his time there, with one ownership change, five coaching changes, and two front-office overhauls). Those who grew tired of his act, who objected to the outbursts and the obstinence and the unhealthy way in which the Kings always seemed to give in to his domineering ways, would wonder aloud in their homes and on local sports talk radio about whether he could truly lead them back to prominence. \nThere was perhaps no better example of Cousins’ divisive powers than the reaction of two prominent radio personalities on the Sacramento sports station, KHTK. Grant Napear, the afternoon host who has been a traveling television announcer for the Kings since 1988, lambasted Cousins on Twitter in the days following the move and celebrated his departure. Meanwhile, fellow radio man Dave Weiglein, aka Carmichael Dave, wrote a 2,826-word column explaining his respect and admiration for the complicated Cousins. \nMORE NBA: 76ers announce star center Joel Embiid out indefinitely with knee swelling \nSo with the Kings three games into life without Cousins, with that trade that sent him to the New Orleans Pelicans on Feb. 19 growing smaller by the day in the Kings’ rear view mirror, it came as no surprise that many of the main characters in his Sacramento story weren’t eager to relive this ride. \nWestphal, who once revealed a Cousins trade demand by way of an official team statement just days before he was fired in early Jan. 2012, didn’t return a call for comment. Current Kings president of basketball operations Vlade Divac, who granted a detailed interview with The Sacramento Bee last weekend to explain the move and declared that “it was time to start over,” politely declined to discuss it all again. \nWhat’s done is done, they all said in their own kind of way, no matter how badly the Kings were hammered by Cousins’ decimated market. They were fleeced, of course, in part because of the red flags surrounding Cousins and also because the scare tactics employed around the league by his agents worked (they were pushing for the five-year, $207 million extension this summer that only the Kings could provide, and it ultimately backfired on both sides). But no matter the haul – in this case Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, a first- and second-round draft pick in 2017 – this was a basketball divorce a long time in the making. \nGALLERY: DEMARCUS COUSINS THROUGH THE YEARS Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
