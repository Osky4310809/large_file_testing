PPD, File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte is open to amending the labor department’s order prohibiting “endo” or end of contract and other “labor only” contracting practices, Malacañang said Wednesday. \nThe issue was discussed during the president’s meeting with labor groups last Monday. \nCiting a statement by labor group Partido ng Manggagawa , presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said workers welcomed Duterte’s stand that contractualization should be totally prohibited. \n“After decades of consistent struggle against the epidemic of contractualization, workers may finally get their demand for its total prohibition, as the President in his first audience with worker groups Monday evening left no doubt that he is not only targeting endo but indeed wants to categorically end all forms of contractualization involving middlemen agencies,” Abella said. \nWhen asked if the labor department’s order on contractualization would be amended, Abella replied: “It’s being facilitated and there will be a few adjustments.” \n“It needs to go through due process,” he added.   \nLast December, the labor department released an order banning endo and labor only contracting schemes. \nThe order bars the termination of the service of a worker after his service agreement with his employer expires. The capital requirement for enterprises involved in permissible contracting arrangements was also increased to P5 million from P3 million \nTo ensure that workers are paid despite collection problems, contractors are now required to maintain a working capital requirement equivalent to 50 percent of its employees’ total salary. Employers who violate the new order would be slapped with fines ranging from P10,000 to P50,000 and would lose their registration. \nSome labor groups have rejected the order, saying it did not address security of tenure issues. They also claimed that the fines and higher capital requirements would not eliminate contractualization. \nLabor groups have urged the president to disregard the labor department’s regulations and to come up with a new executive order that would completely prohibit endo. \nAbella said Duterte was also inclined to honor the request of labor groups to certify House bill no. 4444 or the Security of Tenure Act as an urgent measure. \nAbella said the author of the bill, Trade Union Congress of the Philippines Rep. Raymond Mendoza, lauded Duterte for his stance on contractualization. \n“We were heartened by the pro-poor, pro-worker thinking of the President. We have not had this kind of bold dramatic leadership in previous --- in any previous administration before,” Mendoza was quoted by Abella as saying. \n“The President was playing hard ball and for keeps, when he instructed the DOLE (Department of Labor and Employment) to issue a department order consistent with the agreements of the meeting and his directives at the policy is prohibition of both endo and agency contractualization and the restoration of direct hiring as the employment norm.
