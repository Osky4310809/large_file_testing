On social media people are marking themselves safe and posting prayers, hashtags and memorial updates. Here's one from Ohio:\nSeveral places named Bowling Green are seeing people joining in on the online joke. Just some of the spots where people are checking in as safe and sending sarcastic posts include: Bowling Green, Kentucky; Bowling Green, Ohio; Bowling Green park in New York City; and Bowling Green State University in Ohio.\nThe fictional event quickly garnered its own ribbon and a tagline: \"Never Remember.\" An entire Wikipedia page has even been set up, detailing how this has spiraled beyond a misstated word.\nA fake national park account is even poking fun at Conway's expense with the #NeverRemember hashtag. (You won't find a Bowling Green National Park in America, but there is a Bowling Green Bay National Park in Australia.)\nDo you remember where you were during the #BowlingGreenMasacre ?
