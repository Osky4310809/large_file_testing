The Ned mirrors that of the ever-exclusive Soho House – part club, part hotel and numerous restaurants in the heart of London. The Ned will take over the former Midland Bank building and will host nine different restaurants, 252 hotel rooms, and Ned’s Club.\nThe 252 hotel rooms will be inspired by the 1920s, with vintage pieces and rainforest showers. To really channel the early 20th century, brass and mahogany furniture and chandeliers will adorn each room.\nThe most intriguing feature of this property is the club that mirrors that of Soho House. The Ned Club is available to hotel guests and members and features a rooftop with a 360 view of London, a pool, Canopy Bar and Restaurant and Princes Street and Poultry Domes. The Ned will transform the bank vault into Ned’s Club Downstairs and the Vault Room lounge bar. Members can lounge around within the 3,000 stainless steel deposit boxes that inspired the design of Fort Knox in the 1964 film, Goldfinger.\nFurthermore, Ned Club Active is the members-only fitness center with a yoga studio, Pilates, a spin room and boxing gym amongst the training equipment. Then members can head to Ned Club Relax that contains a 20 meter swimming pool, hamam, sauna and steam room.\nSet to open in Spring 2017, The Ned is currently accepting applications.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T12:14:45.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
