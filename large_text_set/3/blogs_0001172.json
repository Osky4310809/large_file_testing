The film, which is up for an April 14, 2017 release will see its much awaited trailer release soon. The film delves into the grim history of partition. It is the story of a brothel housing 11 women and how their lives change post partition. \nWhile we’ll get to see the film on April 14. Here are five reasons why we are excited for its trailer: \nVidya Balan \nAfter mesmerising us with the sequel to Kahaani, Kahaani 2, Vidya Balan is back on the silver screen with yet another strong character. In fact, talking about the role, Vidya had stated, “I am glad that Srijit (director) decided to come back to me. It is feminine power in full glory. You see the charm, the sensuality, the compassion, but you also see the wrath of an angry woman. I think it is also giving vent to a lot of my angst.” When it comes to deliver hard hitting performances at the box office, no one can match Vidya Balan. \nRemake of bengali film Rajkahini \nThe original film saw Rituparna Sengupta in the lead. The original was based in Bengal instead of Punjab and was one of the most loved films of 2015. It even won several awards at various international film festivals. The film marks the debut of the director of Rajkahini, Srijit Mukherji, in Hindi cinema. All those who have witnessed that hard hitting piece of cinema, should already be excited about this one. \nChunky Pandey as a baddie with a menacing look \nI know when you think of Chunky Pandey the first imagery that’ll come to your mind will be his antics as Aakhri Pasta of the Housefull franchise or his various other comic roles. But all that is set to change with this one. He, in a twist of epic proportions, will be playing a baddie, who, in his own words, is scary. Talking about the role he had stated, “The ADs were in splits because they had seen Housefull 3 just the previous night and didn’t think I could play anyone so evil and gut-wrenchingly ugly. I did the audition without much hope of bagging the role but a few days later, I was called over by Srijit.” He further added that the director took him to a barber shop. He said, “He marched me into a barber’s shop. I came out bald and when I reached home my wife (Bhavna) screamed and ordered me out of our bedroom for the next two weeks. She wouldn’t even look at me till I looked like the normal Chunky”. \nHe also added that there is a scene in the film where his villainous character kills Begum’s pet dog and has it served to the ladies of the brothel who even savour it till they learn the truth. “That’s definitely going to alienate my daughter, who’s a complete dog-lover. But it’s a side to my acting, no one has seen before.” Check out his look here . \nPeriod setting of 1947 \nWhile several movies have been made on the partition of 1947, this is going to be as fresh as it gets. Not once have we seen a film which tells the story of how the partition affected common people and how it affected their day to day life. \nThe strong supporting cast \nWhile Vidya Balan is in the lead, there are a plethora of power packed performers who’ll be seen as the supporting cast. The cast includes the likes of Naseeruddin Shah, Gauhar Khan, Ridhima Tiwari, Pallavi Sharda, Ila Arun, Rajit Kapoor, Pitobash, Nassar, Ashish Vidyarthi, Chunky Pandey etc. Rest assured one thing where the film’s going to score high is performances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T06:17:08.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
