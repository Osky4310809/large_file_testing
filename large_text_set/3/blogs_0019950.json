It seems that, once again, Ryan Reynolds has gotten himself in trouble with Blake Lively, and this time it’s over who is a better cook — his wife or his BFF Jake Gyllenhaal.\nThe whole thing started when Reynolds sat down with Good Morning America where he not only hilariously talked about not wanting to fly with his kids , but also spoke about how Gyllenhaal was “a little bit better” a cook than Lively.\n“Blake, my wife, is very good at cooking, and Jake might be just a little bit better,” he revealed. “He can throw down. It gets very competitive between the two.” \nWATCH: \"Blake my wife is very good at cooking and Jake (Gyllenhaal) might just be little bit better.\" @VancityReynolds pic.twitter.com/GoLPR0vbKo \n— Good Morning America (@GMA) March 16, 2017 Well, it seems that Ryan Reynolds is now officially “in the dog house” over his comments on the morning TV show. Speaking to E! News , Reynolds was quizzed about his statement, and it seems that Blake Lively didn’t take too kindly to missing out on the top spot to Gyllenhaal.\n“Funny enough, I’m actually living right now in an actual dog house,” he joked. “Baxter is usually staying in there, but he’s moved out for now. He’s been upgraded to the main bed.” \nContinuing, he said that both Lively and Gyllenhaal get competitive when it comes to cooking, noting that, “ They’re both incredibly accomplished chefs.” \nOf course, this brought up the inevitable comparisons to reality TV show Chopped. \nWhen quizzed further about what makes Gyllenhaal’s cooking so great, Reynolds said that he did simple food the best (much to the chagrin of his co-star).\n“I’m serious,” he continued. “You’ve made salmon and steak. Those things are really good. I’m simple; like bowls of cereal I’ll do really well. He’s very good at the staples.” \nHmmm…we’re not sure you’re going to get out of it that quickly, Ryan.\nMeanwhile, it was revealed that Reynolds and Gyllenhaal’s on set antics while filming their latest movie Life actually cost producers loads of money. \n“When we would cut, we just couldn’t stop laughing and joking. We wasted so much money,” Gyllenhaal said while appearing on Jimmy Fallon’s late night show. “The producers brought us to the side, and they took us in the corner, and they were like, ‘We need to talk to Ryan and Jake…you guys need to cut it out. We are wasting so much money.’” \nFor now, however, it seems that the ball is firmly in Blake Lively’s corner. In fact, we’d totally tune into a Chopped- style cook off between Gyllenhaal and Lively. Someone needs to set that ASAP.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:31:43.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
