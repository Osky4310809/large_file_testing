With six seconds left on the clock, faced with fourth-and-2 the Packers had time for one last shot into the end zone.\nAaron Rodgers wound up and threw an absolute rainbow that seemed like it was never going to come down.\nRandall Cobb got behind the pack that had gathered on both E’s in Green Bay’s end zone, and waited on the ball to make its landing right into his hands. He got both feet in, and the Packers took a 14-6 lead into the locker room.\nThe play might seem awfully familiar for fans of both franchises, or even Packers season ticket holders, particularly in that end zone. The last time the Packers and Giants met in the postseason, that same play happened in that same end zone.\nNear the end of the first half of the NFC Divisional Round in January 2012, the Giants had the ball — just like the Packers on Sunday -- with six seconds left on the clock. The Giants were going to the same end zone that the Packers were in Sunday, and Eli Manning completed a Hail Mary to Hakeem Nicks .\nThe Giants ended up winning that game, 37-20, and would go on to win the Super Bowl that season over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots .\nBoth plays were spectacular, but it’s an amazing coincidence that they happened under identical circumstances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:23:31.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
