Otherwise, Gabriel, a centre-half, will be asked to deputise. \nBellerin has been away from the first-team in training for the first two days of this week, being monitored closely by the club's medical staff, as they seek to ensure that Bellerin is not suffering from a concussion. \nClub doctor Gary O'Driscoll, formerly of the British and Irish rugby teams, is currently in charge of assessing Bellerin and has campaigned for greater care when it comes to head injuries, and in particular concussion. \nHe is also chairman of the Premier League club doctors' group, the panel that announced new rules regarding head injuries back in 2014. \nMRI scans have given Bellerin the all-clear and according to FA guidelines club doctors have the final say on his return to training.

While this normally takes 14 days, the FA's rules state that if the player is in an enhanced care setting and as long as they pass all the necessary tests, they can return after six days. \n\"If the player shows any signs or symptoms of concussion during this time, they will have to begin the process again. \n\"Of course, regardless of how many days have passed, we would always advise the safety-first approach and recommend players do not return to play unless they are medically assessed as being fully fit to do so.\" Jeff Astle, whose death was down to injuries caused by heading old heavy footballs (Photo: Mirrorpix) Read More Sol Campbell says Arsenal lack leaders as former side look to have blown title chances \nDawn Astle - the daughter of West Brom legend Jeff Astle, who died due to brain trauma injuries at 59, caused by heading footballs - believes Arsenal cannot afford to take any chances with Bellerin. \n\"There is no room for error,\" she told the Daily Mail. \"There is no room for risks. No risks should be taken at all. It's better to err on the side of caution. \n\"I've watched the clip again. He's just out. People think of concussion, it is a bit of a wishy-washy word but it is a brain injury. \n\"If his arm had been broken, people can see that. But you can't see what's happening to the most fragile, complex organ in the body that once it is damaged doesn't repair itself. It's so important.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:23:46.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
