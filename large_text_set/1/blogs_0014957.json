They were also able to practise various defensive driving techniques such as quick obstacle avoidance in a safe, controlled environment. \n“Road safety is a very serious matter and highly relevant to our business. The aim of the defensive driving course is to help raise awareness of safe driving practices and techniques, especially among the increasing number of young drivers in the country, to help reduce fatalities and injuries caused by traffic accidents,” said Kuan. \nMeanwhile, 25 owners of Renault Sport vehicles got the chance to put their track driving skills to the test during the Renault Track Day event, with instructors on hand to coach first timers on how to wring out the most performance from their RS vehicles. \nBy the end of the event, the best recorded lap time around the circut among the owners was 2:33.527, a testament to Renault Sport’s racing DNA. As for those looking to dive into RS ownership, taxi rides around the circuit were also available, with professional drivers behind the wheel. \n“The Track Day sessions have been well received by Renault Sport owners. Now with an expanding line-up of mainstream Renault vehicles, we wanted to engage with customers of these models as well and enhance their ownership experience,” he added. \nTCEC intends to organise the Renault Driving Experience on a yearly basis to offer track day sessions as well as defensive driving courses for Renault Sport and Renault owners in Malaysia.
