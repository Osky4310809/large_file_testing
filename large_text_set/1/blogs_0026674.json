Kennedy International Airport on January 28, 2017 in New York City. Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images \nA daily roundup of the biggest stories in right-wing media. \nConservative media continued its aggressive defense of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. The move caused global chaos , sparked protests in dozens of U.S. airports , and prompted a series of judicial actions to block parts of the order. Advertisement \nThe right-wing website the Blaze mocked backlash to the order writing , “You have to be suicidal, an idiot, or a liar to act like Trump has committed some kind of atrocity simply because he wants to ensure that we’re being extremely careful when we open our doors to people from nests of global jihadism.” The site also argued against the idea that the ban may inspire some foreign radicals to act, writing, “If Islam isn’t to blame for terrorism, why are you so worried about turning Muslims into terrorists?” \nBreitbart seized on the same concern, calling Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer a “fear monger” for asserting that Trump’s order would “encourage lone wolves in America.” Meanwhile, another Breitbart post titled “Islamic State Supporters React Angrily to Trump’s Temporary Refugee Halt,” contained “exclusive” messages from alleged ISIS terrorists, which it claimed to have obtained from the Telegram app. One such alleged terrorist sympathizer said: The madman Trump is still ignorant of politics, science and culture. That Islam-hating Crusader prevents Muslims from entering America. That failed Nazi thinks that this will stop the mujahedeen from striking his country. Doesn’t he understand that his country will implode? When that happens, he’ll panic and backpedal on his Islam-hating policies. \nAccording to Breitbart , the message-writer “offered no explanation as to how the U.S. will purportedly implode from implementing stricter security screening procedures aimed at keeping terrorists out of the country.” \nIn responding to American outrage over the order, Sean Hannity and Breitbart cited a poll saying 57 percent of U.S. voter favored a temporary ban on refugees from some countries. The posts then note that the survey was conducted prior to Trump’s order. \nIn a piece headlined “Trump’s Order on Refugees: Mostly Right on Substance, Wrong on Rollout,” the National Review ’s editorial board defended the core of the action while scolding the “amateurism” of its implementation. \nSeveral sites also continued to repeat Trump’s explanation for the ban. Trump said Obama had done the same thing in 2011, a claim that was debunked by the Washington Post fact checker as mostly false. \nLaura Wagner is a reporter in Washington.
