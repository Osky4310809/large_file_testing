Touted as a “lifestyle-utility” transport solution, the Ego Solariz joins Yamaha’s Malaysian “Ego” range of scooters – the Avantiz, Ego S and Ego LC – as well as the 150 cc Yamaha NMax. \nCarrying a 125 cc, air-cooled, SOHC, single-cylinder power plant, the new Solariz puts out 9.38 hp at 8,000 rpm and 9.6 Nm of torque at 5,500 rpm. The engine drives a CVT gearbox with V-belt final drive and starting is with either electric push-button or kick. \nWith a wet weight of 94 kg, fuel for this scooter is carried in a 4.2-litre tank, and there is a 10-litre underseat storage compartment. Seat height is set at a low 750 mm, with ground clearance at 135 mm, making the Solariz suitable for all riders. \nBraking at the front is with a single disc brake, with telescopic front forks, while the rear uses a drum, with monoshock suspension on the integrated engine/swing-arm assembly. \nThe Ego Solariz is targetted towards the young urban commuter or student, and comes in four colour choices – Popular Red, Iconic Blue, Classic-Sport Brown and Trendy Magenta. \nPriced at RM5,548, including GST, the 2017 Yamaha Ego Solariz will be available at Yamaha dealers from January.
