James Milner gave the visitors the lead with a controversial penalty early in the second half, after City had a spot-kick of their own turned down before the break. Sergio Aguero tied things up with 20 minutes left to play, and despite several great late chances, neither team could find a winner. Per City's official Twitter account, the hosts kept Bacary Sagna on the bench: Manchester City @ManCity City XI | Caballero, Fernandinho, Stones, Otamendi, Clichy, Yaya Touré, Sané, De Bruyne, Silva (C), Sterling, Agüero #cityvlfc #mcfc Liverpool opted for Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane, Georginio Wijnaldum and Philippe Coutinho in attack, leaving Divock Origi with a spot on the bench: Liverpool FC @LFC Confirmed #LFC team to face @ManCity: Mignolet, Clyne, Matip, Klavan, Milner, Can, Wijnaldum, Lallana, Mane, Coutinho, Firmino. 3/19/2017, 3:28:58 PM From the opening minute, tackles were flying, with both teams taking advantage of the slick playing surface at the Etihad Stadium . Nicolas Otamendi took out Mane early, and the Argentinian could have been booked. Emre Can should have seen yellow for a blatant foul on Kevin De Bruyne, but somehow, he escaped a booking. Firmino wasn't so lucky after 16 minutes, however, as he was punished for a foul on David Silva. The Spaniard fired a great chance wide before Yaya Toure joined Firmino in the referee's notes for a dreadful tackle on Can. Nick Akerman of Bleacher Report UK predicted bad things for the Ivorian: Nick Akerman @Nakerman Yaya's going to overstretch and get sent off. Being on a booking in a Michael Oliver game is as good as being off. Mane wanted a penalty shortly after, but referee Michael Oliver didn't see enough in the tackle from Otamendi to warrant a foul. OLI SCARFF/Getty Images The Citizens took more and more control as the half wore on, with Leroy Sane and Nathaniel Clyne serving up a duel for the ages. The number of chances increased dramatically toward the end of the half, with both Simon Mignolet and Willy Caballero kept busy. Joel Matip headed wide before Raheem Sterling missed a huge chance, as Silva played the winger in perfectly and Milner intervened in the nick of time. Pundits were unsure whether the former City star fouled Sterling, however, per James Robson of the Manchester Evening News : James Robson @JamesRobsonMEN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T02:07:29.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
