We’re guessing it’s for the more lighthearted side of the aforementioned epic minds.\nThe designs mix brights and pastels in an appealing way and feature sayings and prints of sports equipment. We can totally see these items making appearances in any Wes Anderson movie. The tennis racquet designs bring to mind forlorn tennis star Richie Tenenbaum; his adopted sister Margot might scribble down ideas for plays in any of the notebooks.\nHadron Epoch Actress/model/singer Hannah McCloud collaborated with the brand on the collection and models in the campaign.\nHadron Epoch In case you were wondering, the company was named for the period that occurred in the microseconds after the Big Bang, when the universe was born.
