Here are some of his most memorable strikes for the Gunners. The guys answer your tweets on odd bench activity, Arsenal club legends returning, and Atletico v Leverkusen UCL favourites. \nThe FA Cup has saved Arsene Wenger before. Back in 2014, his reign as Arsenal manager appeared to be on the verge of ending. Arsenal had endured difficult campaigns in the Premier League and Champions League and fan discontent was mounting just as the boss' contract was approaching expiry. However, Arsenal managed to find some salvation in the form of Wembley triumph and their first trophy win in nine years. \nThe subsequent outpouring of relief and revelry granted Wenger the opportunity to extend his stay in north London by a further three seasons. Now, the cup appears to be opening up for Arsenal once again. \nThere's no doubt that Arsenal have been the beneficiaries of some kind draws down the years. The Gunners lifted the FA Cup in both 2014 and 2015, and while there were some marquee wins along the way -- the 2-1 win at Old Trafford in March 2015 immediately springs to mind -- there were also a good proportion of decidedly winnable home ties. Fate has favoured Wenger in this competition. \nTwo years ago, Arsenal faced Championship side Wigan in the semifinal before taking on Hull in the final. Twelve months later, the formula was remarkably similar -- it was another lower-league side in Reading followed by relegated Aston Villa. \nThis season, they've found themselves pitted against two non-league teams in succession. After dispatching Sutton United on Monday , Arsenal can look forward to another David vs. Goliath clash with Lincoln City at the Emirates Stadium. Facing that level of opponent brings its own unique challenges, but Wenger will nevertheless be delighted with the draw. Beating Lincoln would take Arsenal into the semifinals and back to Wembley. Suddenly, the Gunners would be just two wins from silverware. \nThat's where Arsenal's luck runs dry. The last four could be fiercely competitive. Right now, it's possible that there will be two showpiece semifinals between four of Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham, Manchester City and Arsenal. It would be fitting if Arsene Wenger capped his career with another big day at Wembley, but it probably won't save his job. \nWenger will cross that bridge when he comes to it. If he can navigate his side through that daunting selection of sides and bring the trophy back to the Emirates Stadium, it would certainly put a positive spin on a largely underwhelming campaign. A disappointing 2016-17 could yet have a delightful denouement. \nThe question is, would winning the cup be enough to keep Wenger in his job? It would certainly help the boss mount a case for staying, especially if he can also keep Arsenal in the top four amid similarly stiff competition. Three trophies in four years is a creditable record for any manager and Wenger would doubtless cite the silverware as a potential platform for Premier League success. \nThe problem is that 2014's cup win was supposed to be that springboard -- as was that of 2015. Arsenal fans hoped success in the FA Cup would precipitate challenging for more exalted trophies, but this hasn't proved to be the case. The worry is that while Wenger seems capable of leading his team through the six fixtures required to win the cup, a more sustained campaign -- as is required in the Premier League or Champions League -- remains beyond him. \nThree years ago, FA cup success made it seem like Arsenal had turned a corner. Another success in that competition would be welcome, but might also feel a little like going round in circles. As a club, they must aspire to more than being a good cup team. \nWenger has won the FA Cup on six separate occasions. In the history of the competition, only legendary Aston Villa manager George Ramsey can rival his glorious affinity with the trophy. It would be fitting if he capped his career with another big day at Wembley. However, while a cup win could yet save Arsenal's season, it will probably not be enough to save Wenger's job. It would make for a fantastic farewell, but is unlikely to pacify a fan base who understandably demand more. \nJames McNicholas is one of ESPN FC's Arsenal bloggers.
