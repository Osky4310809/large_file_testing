Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nBrexit campaigner Gina Miller has revealed vile death threats could force her to leave the UK. \nPolice are probing at least 22 cases of intimidation – including a £5,000 bounty on her head. \nMrs Miller, 51, who has now won her legal battle with the Government, said: “We’ve had graphic letters where they’ve taken the time to cut and paste images of me being shot, beheaded, gang raped. \n“They send very long messages on email or through LinkedIn. One person put a £5,000 bounty on my head for me to be run over.

People pick up the phone and actually shout and scream at us. These are genuine threats. These are people who know where my office is and can see me walk in in the morning.” \nShe has also been warned she will be the “next Jo Cox” – the MP who was shot and stabbed to death – and will have acid thrown in her face.

The businesswoman was one of several campaigners whose challenge was upheld by the Supreme Court last week. \nBut now she fears she may have to move abroad to escape her vicious trolls.

That’s the thing that upsets me most, the idea my security could be so at risk that I would have to leave the UK. \n“I don’t want to leave my home, my friends, my family. I’ve been here since I was 10. Why would I want to do that?” \nThe Guyanese-born fund manager added tearfully: “I don’t want to leave the UK. But the choice would have to be Britain, or my children and my family’s safety.” Gina Miller speaks outside the Supreme Court (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nPanic buttons have been installed in her home, a protection team has been hired to work with the police, and cyber security has been stepped up amid attempts to hack her websites. \nEight cease and desist letters have been issued through the Met Police , two arrests have been made and at least 12 other inquiries are ongoing. \nShe no longer uses public transport and spends weekends locked in her London home with husband Alan and their family.

But she added: “My son was walking past my laptop when I was working one day. He saw an email and got very concerned. \n“I thought my daughter was coping, but one Sunday we’d run out of food. I needed to nip to the end of the road and said I’d be five or 10 minutes. But it was obviously too long – she had a complete meltdown. Simply going to the shops causes stress for her family (Photo: Ian Vogler/Daily Mirror) \n“She was screaming at my husband, ‘You’ve got to go and get Mummy. Something has happened to Mummy.’” \nShe said: “I’m frightened, fearful and I’m always looking over my shoulder. That’s how we’re living our lives every day.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T20:43:37.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
