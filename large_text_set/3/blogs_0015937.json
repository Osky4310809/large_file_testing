Android Police broke the story, citing an independent source, with images that are in keeping with a render leak we saw in February .\nZTE appears to be keeping a “no frills” approach with regards to the Quartz design: it looks like a plain, metal timepiece, with notches at the hour marks, and plastic wristband (though it likely comes with a choice of straps).\n\nThe Quartz features a crown on the top right-hand side, but lacks NFC, a heart-rate monitor, and LTE according to Android Police . Wireless charging also looks absent (it’s pictured with a four-pin charge cradle), however, it does have 3G support. More specific specs information wasn’t disclosed.\nIt’s possible that ZTE is focusing more on features than sex appeal with the Quartz (even the watch face looks drab). There are plenty of watches coming out which focus on the “fashion accessory” aspect of the device rather than function. But without NFC, a heart-rate monitor, or rotating bezel, it doesn’t exactly appear “feature-rich” either. Who knows where this one’s headed.\n\nThe ZTE Quartz will launch with Android Wear 2.0 , but price and availability details are still unknown. That said, products generally don’t leak in such detail until late in their development, so we’ll likely here more soon.\nWhat are your early thoughts on the ZTE Quartz?
