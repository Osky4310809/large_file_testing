construction, completion and rehabilitation of federal secretariats, N5.379 billion; Zik Mausoleum and Prototype Housing Scheme, N1.325 billion and Projects and Programmes under PPP, N3.367 billion. \nOthers are Cadastral URD and Lands, N3 billion; URD/Special Projects, N2.140 billion; payment of outstanding local debts, N1.2 billion; and Constituency Outreach Intervention Projects, N1.69 billion etc. \nThe committee asked the Minister to forward a written request through the Ministries of Finance and Budget and National Planning. \nThere was, however, disagreement between the two parties when the seemingly moribund status of the Federal Housing Authority, FHA, was raised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T11:12:05.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
