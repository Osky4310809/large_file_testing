He explained Friday that he wants more time to prepare for what he believes is a once in a lifetime experience. \n“Long season,” Williams said, via ESPN.com. “[I] haven’t had much time to prepare for it , so I’m going to take this week and next week to prepare for it and run it at my pro day. … You only run the 40 once, ever, in your life. You always be running routes. I was just focusing on what I’m going to be doing for a long time.” \nWilliams was measured at just under 6’4″ in Indianapolis and weighs 218 pounds, which makes his size a major calling card for NFL teams. If he turns in a time on March 16 that matches well with that frame, Williams will likely be hearing his name early on the first night of the draft.
