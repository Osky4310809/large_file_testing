Not only did she perform during the Bee Gees tribute , the “Confident” singer was also nominated for her first ever award in the Best Pop Vocal Album category. She ultimately lost out to Adele, a move the Disney alum says she saw coming. “My mom was like, ‘You know that Adele’s going to win this?’ I was like, ‘Thanks, Mom! Way to stay positive,’” she quipped during Wednesday’s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Though she assumed Adele would win, Lovato admits that a tiny part of her held out hope. “Hey, listen, elections are crazy, so I thought, ‘Maybe I have a shot!’” she joked. “I was praying that the Russians were going to pull through for me.” She even showed off her daring side on the red carpet, rocking a crocheted Julien Macdonald gown. “It was completely see-through,” the 24-year-old admitted. “At first I tried on the dress, and I was like, ‘I’m not wearing this. It’s see through!’ Then my stylist was like, ‘But it looks amazing!’ and everyone was like, ‘It looks amazing!’ And I convinced myself. But I was actually on the red carpet with my dad and that was awkward.” Photo: Getty Images Her dad told her he “approved,” but she then caved, saying, “I don’t know! We didn’t talk about it!” One man who definitely approves of her style is her boyfriend, Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos, who has been training her in MMA fighting.
