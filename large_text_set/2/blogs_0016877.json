Other benefits included potential cost reductions and the hope that it could drive innovation. Going green often required significant shifts in how companies do business. \nTrying to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by using green energy often does more harm to the environment than good, according to other research. \nGreen mandates to build solar panels have actually temporarily increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to how much energy is used in their construction, a study by Utrecht University concluded . \nStoring solar energy in batteries for nighttime use actually increases both energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to a study by the University of Texas Energy Institute . Researchers concluded that homes that used battery storage ended up consuming between 8 percent and 14 percent more electricity than homes that didn’t. \nBurning natural gas for electricity will generally result in lower pollution and fewer CO2 emissions than trying to store green energy in batteries — largely because batteries waste a lot of power charging themselves. Storing enough electricity in batteries to support wind and solar power also face enormous physical problems, which could make it economically impossible, according to another study published in June by chemists at Texas A&M . \nSome environmental groups already oppose solar and wind power project due to other environmental impacts. The Center For Biological Diversity (CBD) has pursued legal action to block the creation of solar-farms out of fear that they would encroach on 32 endangered desert tortoises and that sunlight-concentrating panels act like super-heated death-rays for birds, killing tens of thousands of them per year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:45:41.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
