Trump and Vladimir Putin to hold summit 'within weeks' Read more \nEighteen House Democrats , including civil rights leader John Lewis and John Conyers, the longest serving congressman currently in office, have said they will not attend Friday’s inauguration, marking a significant break from the tradition of witnessing the peaceful transition of power. \nGeorgia congressman Lewis, who was arrested numerous times in the 1960s civil rights campaigns and was beaten during the historic march over the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama in 1965, said on Friday he would not attend the ceremony due to concerns over Russian interference in the 2016 election. \n“I don’t see this president-elect as a legitimate president,” Lewis told NBC’s Meet the Press, citing a consensus in the US intelligence community that Russian hackers infiltrated the emails of a top Clinton aide and leaked thousands of embarrassing documents to destabilise the election. \n“I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.” \nOver the weekend, which marked the start of the Martin Luther King Jr Day public holiday, the president-elect used Twitter to lambast the 76-year-old African American, whom he said “should spend more time fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. \n“All talk, talk, talk – no action or results. Sad!” \nOn Sunday, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough told CNN’s State of the Union he believed Lewis’s concerns were “by no means trivial” but argued Obama believed that Trump was the “freely elected president”.

Their efforts to divide us, to weaken us, to advance their own interests at the expense of ours, are going to fail.” \nIn an interview with Fox News Sunday, vice-president elect Mike Pence indicated such an act of reconciliation would be unlikely, saying he was “deeply disappointed” by Lewis’s comments. \nLewis too seemed not to be in conciliatory mood, telling NBC that if Trump were to ask him to work with him, “I would say, ‘Mr President, Mr Trump, it’s going to be hard. It’s going to be tough.’” \nPence also offered the frankest denial yet of any contact between the Trump campaign and Russian authorities during the election, as was described in an explosive but unverified dossier authored by a former MI6 agent and published by BuzzFeed earlier in the week. \nPressed repeatedly, Pence eventually said: “Of course not, why would there be any contacts between the campaign?” \nHe added: “This is all a distraction, and it’s all part of a narrative to delegitimize the election. The American people see right through it.” \nPence had earlier caveated his response by stating he had only been part of the Trump campaign since July last year. \n“I joined this campaign in the summer and I can tell you that all the contact by the Trump campaign and associates was with the American people,” he said. \nThe former Indiana governor also denied that phone calls between Trump’s incoming national security adviser Mike Flynn and Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, involved discussions related to President Obama’s sanctions against the Russian regime in response its interference in the election. \n“I talked to General Flynn yesterday, and the conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to new US sanctions against Russia and the expulsion of diplomats,” Pence said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T19:04:52.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
