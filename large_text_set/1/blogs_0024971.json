Also Read: Trump's Muslim Ban Is 'Both Unconstitutional and Deeply Wrong,' Says Writers Guild of America \nTrump’s executive order, signed Friday, ended refugee entry into the United States for 120 days, and barred all citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations from entering the U.S. for the next three months. \nThe order set off confusion and chaos at airports worldwide as officials seemed unclear how to implement it. White House senior advisor Reince Preibus said those holding so-called green cards as permanent U.S. residents should not be subject to the order.

The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong – they are sadly weak on immigration. The two… \n— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 Every 'SNL' Alec Baldwin Donald Trump Cold Open Ranked, From Least to Most Retweetable (Photos) \nWe’re in for at least (probably) four years of Donald Trump as President of the United States. That means lots of bad things and one particularly great thing: We’re in for a lot more Alec Baldwin impersonations of Trump on “Saturday Night Live.” From the often ridiculous phrases to the weird outbursts, “SNL” has captured all of it. In fact, the sketches often seem to struggle to surpass reality in terms of absurdity. But they get there. Here’s a list of every Baldwin-as-Trump “SNL” sketch, ranked from least to most hilarious, with links to the sketches. NBC \n9. Trump’s Classroom Cold Open (Dec. 3) Trump retweets ridiculous people, like a 16-year-old and a white supremacist. This one’s sadder than it is funny, though, because most of it doesn’t even require jokes. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n8. Donald Trump Prepares Cold Open (Nov. 19) Fresh off winning the election, Trump’s completely unprepared. We already know that Mike Pence will do everything, but good effort, “SNL.” You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n7. Trump’s Christmas Cold Open (Dec. 17) Vladimir Putin and Rex Tillerson drop by Trump Tower for Christmas. This one definitely brings to mind the phrase, “No puppet, no puppet.” It's also, perhaps, the most outright terrifying of all of these. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n6. Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton — Debate Three Cold Open (Oct. 22) Trump is winning “every single poll taken outside a Cracker Barrel,” but it’s Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton who steals this one — kind of like in real life. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n5. Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton — Debate 1 Cold Open (Oct. 1) The first debate really found Baldwin hitting the Trump stride. It’s mostly just him shouting “Gina” in a very insistent tone (his weird pronunciation of \"China\"). “Yuge Gina” gets a lot of mileage though. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n4. VP Debate Cold Open (Oct. 8) Trump nabs the spotlight from the vice presidential debate and realizes he needs to be a lot more careful about talking about sexually assaulting people while wearing hot mics. Describing himself as a gross groping hurricane is hilariously cringe-worthy. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n3. Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump Cold Open (Nov. 5) CNN doesn’t care that Trump literally kisses the FBI, Putin and the KKK, instead pestering Hillary about emails. Alec and Kate heartwarming run through Times Square is the real sweet spot of the sketch. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n2. Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton Town Hall Debate Cold Open (Oct. 15) Of all the debates, the second was the funniest. Trump lurking in the background and slipping past Hillary like he’s the shark in a “Jaws” movie completely captures the awkwardness of the real event. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n1. Donald Trump Press Conference Cold Open (Jan. 14) It might be the lowest-brow of the sketches, but Trump accidentally talking about urine throughout his press conference is bested only by the line, “I’m not talking about the pee-pee, because it didn’t happen and it wasn’t as cool as it sounds.” You can watch that sketch here.
