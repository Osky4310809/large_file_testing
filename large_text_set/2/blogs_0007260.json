Kohn , an expert on civil-military relations and professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina. “But leading off with the election, attacking the press and talking about endorsements is a clear attempt to politicize the military and invite their partisanship. In rhetoric and style, his words mimicked a campaign rally.” George C. Marshall, the five-star general who also led the State Department and the Pentagon, once observed that he was so determined to avoid the appearance of being political that he did not vote. That legacy has continued, and is honored by a number of military officers who have pinned stars on their shoulders. During the election season, there was considerable debate about whether it was appropriate for retired generals like Michael T. Flynn (for Mr. Trump) or John R. Allen (for Hillary Clinton) to endorse candidates. But there was no question that active-duty officers were to stay far away from politics. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Gen. David L. Goldfein , the Air Force chief of staff, told reporters on Tuesday that military leaders had an obligation to “speak truth to power regardless of party.” He declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks. Peter D. Feaver , a political science professor at Duke University who served on the staff of the National Security Council under Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, said that Mr. Trump was right to try to build a relationship with the military he now commands. But he said it was a mistake for the president to speculate about its voting behavior. “The military, the intelligence community and the foreign service jealously guard their professional identity of being nonpartisan and apolitical,” Mr. Feaver said. “Thus it is counterproductive to try to connect with them by appealing to a supposed partisan identity.” Mr. Trump’s trip to MacDill follows similar appearances at the Pentagon and the C.I.A., both of which the president used as a backdrop for comments that veered into politics With Defense Secretary Jim Mattis at this side, Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month restricting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The signing was conducted in the Pentagon’s Hall of Heroes, which is dedicated to the more than 3,460 recipients of the Medal of Honor, the military’s highest decoration. Mr. Mattis did not know that the order was to be signed until shortly before that event, and he had no input in its formulation. “This is part of a pattern,” said Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger officer who held a senior policy position in the Defense Department on Middle East issues during the Obama administration. “Whether it is the Memorial Wall at the C.I.A., or the Hall of Heroes at the Pentagon, he is using institutions that have previously been walled off from politics to generate political support for some of his more contentious policies.” “If the military is seen as a Donald Trump institution, that’s dangerous as well,” Mr. Exum added. “It could create the impression among young Americans that the military is a political institution.” \nFollow The New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:52:33.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
