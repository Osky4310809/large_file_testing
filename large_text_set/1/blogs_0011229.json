Located in Norfolk near the North Sea, the estate was given to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge by Queen Elizabeth II as a wedding gift. But living in the countryside is somewhat of an unusual choice for a future King of England. It has, however, provided the young family with a certain degree of privacy. \nThe hall is roughly 120 miles from London’s Kensington Palace, which is technically the Duke and Duchess’s official residence. Anmer Hall is located on the Sandringham Estate, about three miles from the Queen’s own Norfolk residence. (So when the Duke and Duchess celebrate Christmas with the royal family, they have a quick trip over to Grandma’s house .) Prince William and Prince Harry have been going to Sandringham Estate for weekends since they were children, so Anmer Hall wasn’t exactly foreign territory for the Duke. And through his work as an air ambulance pilot, for which he is stationed at an air base in Cambridge, it makes for a good work commute. But before the couple were able to move into the hall, a few renovations were needed. \nA brick Georgian manor, Anmer Hall was built over 200 years ago in 1802. It has 10 bedrooms, as well as a swimming pool and a tennis court. The property likely now has its fair share of security, and is protected by a no-fly zone. Guarded, yes, but not removed from the rhythms of normal life. Prince George attends a nearby Montessori school in East Walton, and the Duke and Duchess are frequently seen in town. A happy country life and a happy country home to match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:29:16.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
