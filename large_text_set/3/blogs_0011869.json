I had an unfortunate incident with a minor brain hemorrhage which means I’ll be in rehabilitation for a while. But I’m excited about trying to get past this speed bump. I’m improving every day.” \nRobinson spent 17 years in the NBA – eight in Portland – and was a key member of the Blazers during the ’90s. He was named to the All-Star team during the 1993-94 season, averaging 20.1 points and 6.7 rebounds. He averaged more than 20 points three times in his career, which came to an end in 2007.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T01:42:52.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
