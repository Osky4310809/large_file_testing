A video taken by a customer, Arpan Verma, in Jaipur shows that there were cockroaches breeding in the refrigerated counter at the outlet. When he filmed the unhygienic food counter along with showing the faces of the staff who weren't paying any heed to the issues, a female member of the staff, who was filming HIM in return came over and slapped him. \nYes that happened. \nMr. Verma used no foul language in the video and he was simply recording what he saw along with recording the staff members because they were taking no action to rectify the situation. Why the hell did he get slapped then? \nThere seem to be no answer from either the lady or the CCD outlet. Despite tweeting to them, CCD didn't care to respond and instead kept tweeting about their \"refreshing drinks\". \nWhen Story Pick got in touch with CCD they finally gave them an official response, saying, \"The incident had been brought to our notice and has been escalated. Our corporate affairs team is in talks with the consumer and the internal cafe team to ascertain facts.\" Verma followed up by writing a note on the whole matter as well. \nThis is extremely disturbing. The fact that the staff member thought that it was okay to slap a customer and later justify it by asking him \"how dare he take her picture?\" (as he mentioned in his full complaint) is ridiculous. The customer has every right to click a video of a counter full of cockroaches and the staff who still continues to serve food from the same fridge. \nGetting slapped for complaining is insane and just because it was a woman slapping a man, it doesn't make the whole thing okay.
