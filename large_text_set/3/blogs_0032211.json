One of those games is StarCraft released in 1998, and Blizzard is set to remaster it ahead of the game's 20th anniversary next year. \nFor anyone who played the original, the good news is Blizzard will not be messing with the gameplay or balance. However, according to Kotaku , everything else is receiving a major upgrade. The graphics are being updated to support resolutions up to 4K, the game audio and dialogue is being revised, and \"race-themed comic book interludes\" are being created to tell the original story, but with \"a fresh coat of paint.\" \nThe newly detailed visuals have allowed Blizzard to implement a zoom feature allowing you to zoom in and look at the detail on every unit, or zoom out for \"a Battlecruiser's view of the battlefield.\" This should be especially enjoyable to use on a large 4K monitor . Related Blizzard Won't Remaster Warcraft Because It Isn't Fun Anymore \nAs for multiplayer, Blizzard will be adding support for the Blizzard app, formerly known as Battle.net . This will allow for easy matchmaking and interaction with your StarCraft-playing friends around the world. \nThe upgraded game will be called StarCraft: Remastered and will include both the original game and the StarCraft: Brood War expansion, which added new campaigns, maps, units, and upgrade advancements. Both the original game and the expansion were hugely popular on release and have sold around 10 million copies worldwide. Blizzard will be hoping for millions more now. \nBlizzard isn't specifying a release date beyond stating it will be out on PC in Summer 2017. There's also no price information, but we should expect a full priced game and then be surprised if it isn't. I'd also be surprised if there wasn't a collector's edition offered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:32:48.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
