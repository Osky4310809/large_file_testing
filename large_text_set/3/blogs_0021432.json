I assumed it was just an accident. \n“Fairly shortly after I heard some shots. I thought then that something was going on. \n“As I went over to see what was going on they were starting to move people back. \n“I think I saw a couple of bodies on the ground.

I was on the opposite side of Westminster Bridge as the car ran over everyone on the sidewalk. Holy s***. \nThe car is believed to have eventually crashed into the railings of Parliament at the end of Westminster Bridge. \nChristopher Hope, a journalist at the Daily Telegraph, witnessed part of the Westminster Bridge attack. \nSteve Boulton and his wife Karen, from Caversham in Reading, had travelled to Parliament to watch Prime Minister’s Questions as a treat for his 50 th birthday. \nThe couple were having lunch in a nearby restaurant when they heard “some muffled bangs in the distance”. A pedestrian is looked after by members of the public (Toby Melville /Reuters) \nMrs Boulton said: “We came out of the restaurant and hit this horde of people coming the other way. \n“We got a little way along Westminster Bridge when someone said you have to go back and it was a terrorist incident. \n“We saw two bodies in the road. It was really frightening.” \nHe told BBC Radio 5 live: “There was a loud bang on Westminster bridge opposite the pub there, the Westminster Tavern I think it’s called, next to Boots. \n“Then there was screaming and shouting and I saw about 100 people running from the bridge across down towards Westminster Abbey. \n“And then as they were running it was clear something was going on because people were looking where the bang was and it sounded maybe like an explosion or maybe a car hit some railings or maybe someone was hit by a car but it was a big bang and then there was shooting several shots were fired and there were two individuals lying outside Westminster Hall on the road being treated by medics and an ambulance had just pulled up.” Eyewitness describes what he saw \nTourist Bradford Buck was outside Parliament when the attack happened and said he saw a victim “curled up on the ground” following the attack. \nIn a video clip posted on Twitter by journalist Jim Waterson, Mr Buck said: “We came up from the Westminster Underground and we saw a car crashed into the gate, the fence around the Parliament. \n“There was a man lying on the ground and then the police officers were running with machine guns so the first thing I said to my wife and friend is get behind the concrete and we were all kind of watching, everybody’s in a little bit of shock. \n“Then pretty quickly the London police were here just shooing everybody out of here. \n“There was a person on the ground. It was a regular civilian, somebody on the ground. They looked pretty bad. They weren’t moving too much. They were kind of curled up on the ground.” \nThe bridge has been cordoned off while paramedics treat the injured. \nVauxhall to Embankment has also been closed \"as part of the security response\", according to the Port of London Authority.
