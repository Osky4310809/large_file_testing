Not that it had gone anywhere, but the underrated classic has made a power-shoulder-strong appearance in celebrity outfits. In 2017, the humble white shirt ain’t the wardrobe underdog. If anything, it’s the self-sustaining hero of outfits. And, it can be worn to the most unexpected places. We chalked out these celebrity outfits to inspire you to get your white shirt out. To Work \nAnushka Sharma’s asymmetrical shirt, by Kanikal Goyal, is easily a boardroom winner. Pair the style with formal-looking sweatpants, and pull off the best illusion of all times.

The introduction of a metallic skirt was all the motivation that her not-so-humble shirt needed, to shine.

Wear this look to your bestie’s wedding, and with mucho gusto. A photo posted by @afashionistasdiaries on Dec 29, 2016 at 1:18am PST To A Glamorous Evening \nNeha Dhupia makes a resounding case for the white shirt with her offbeat Chola outfit. Together, with maximal bow and a rebellious hemline, the shirt acts as the perfect separate with the volumious skirt. A photo posted by Sohaya (@chola_the_label) on Jan 14, 2017 at 11:16am PST To A Retro-Themed Party \nSonakshi Sinha is one pair of thigh-high boots away from being crowned the best dressed at a 70s themed party. Her white shirt, tucked in an ultra-mini skirt, (both by Zara) should be reserved for groovy nights.
