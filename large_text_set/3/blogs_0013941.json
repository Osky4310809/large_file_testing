Henry Speight of the Brumbies is tackled by Brynard Stander of the Force. Source: AAP \nThe Force have never made the playoffs but are showing some signs of life this season under bright new coach Dave Wessels. \nThe Brumbies have had off-field troubles in recent times but on the park they are Australia’s most successful franchise and have won two Super Rugby titles. \nThe privately owned Rebels, meanwhile, have made an atrocious start to the 2017 season, suffering humiliating losses to the Blues and Hurricanes. \nThe Rebels have also never made the playoffs. \nBut club owner Andrew Cox has expressed extreme confidence that the Melbourne side was safe from any potential cull. \nFormer Wallaby Glen Ella, meanwhile, has argued in favour of a reduction to four Australian teams, with the Brumbies and Rebels then merging. Hunt mic'd up 2:48 \nThe competition was particularly lopsided last season, with Kiwi teams dominating, and the same trend is continuing after three rounds in 2017. \n“Following two days of robust discussion there are a number of tournament considerations that now require further discussion and consultation,” SANZAAR’s South African chief executive Andy Marinos said in a statement on Saturday. \n“SANZAAR will make a formal statement on the future of the organisation, Super Rugby and the tournament format in the coming days once these further meetings have been concluded.” \nThe Daily Telegraph reported that broadcasters in the four member nations (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina), including Fox Sports, were reviewing the proposal and would meet relevant rugby bosses later this week to discuss any overhaul.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T02:53:15.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
