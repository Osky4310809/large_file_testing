In addition to using more accurate imagery and listing the drink’s ingredients in order of prominence, revisions include clear text that states whether the product is a \"Fruit Juice,\" \"Fruit & Veggie Juice,\" or a smoothie and reduced text font for the bottles’ \"100% Juice\" and “No Sugar Added” claims. Naked Juice will also have to include an asterisked statement saying that the product is “not a low-calorie food.\"\nThe lawsuit was filed on Oct. 4 by Dina Lipkind, Lyle Takeshita and Chad Fenwick and was settled on Feb. 14.
