Realtime video processing, elaborate noise correction, visual effects and renders are all hard on the graphics card, which makes it well worth replacing regularly for post professionalsâ€”or really, anyone working with a lot of video. While there is always a temptation to splurge for a high end card like the Titan, which can run over $1000 and is targeted for scientific and AI applications, most filmmakers are well served with a top-of-the line gaming card which will offer a lot of bang for a much smaller price. \nNVIDIA' s new GeForce GTX 1080 Ti comes in at just slightly more than half the price of the Titan-X ($699 vs $1200), but according to NVIDIA, is even faster than the larger card in certain applications. The Ti offers 35% more performance than the previous 1080 card, which has proved itself popular with filmmakers and gamers. With 11GB of onboard GDDR5 memory (sometimes referred to as VRAM), the card is designed for and equipped to handle high resolution, stereoscopic and VR imagery with ease.

Not to be outdone, NVIDIA's main competitor AMD has announced their comparable Vega line of cards that will be available later this spring. \nAvailable from NVIDIA partners worldwide on March 10th for a recommended retail price of $699.
