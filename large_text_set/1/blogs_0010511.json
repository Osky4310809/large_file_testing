They know their style of play well, with and without the ball. \n\"We knew about the difficulty of the game against Villarreal, but we deserved to win. I have nothing more to say to my players, we played a great game. \n\"The same feelings that I had in Bilbao, [we played] even better in fact. We created many chances against the team who has conceded the fewest goals in La Liga, although we were not as accurate as we could have been in the final metres.\" \nThird-placed Barca now sit five points adrift of leaders Real Madrid, who have a game in hand. \n\"There is plenty of the league still to play, we will definitely be fighting for it,\" added Luis Enrique. \"We must continue improving and be even stronger to fix this form. \n\"The hardest thing in football is to score goals.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:48:10.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
