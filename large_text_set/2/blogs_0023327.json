Today’s recipe: yogurt-spiced chicken and preserved lemon skewers with asparagus spears. \nIn this easy dish, skewered chicken cubes and asparagus are cooked on the same baking sheet, making prep and cleanup a breeze. If you can’t find preserved lemons in the specialty foods aisle of your grocery store, simply roast slices of raw lemons alongside the chicken. For this recipe you will need 8 to 10 wooden skewers, each 7 inches (18 cm) or longer and soaked in water for at least an hour before using. \n\nYogurt-Spiced Chicken and Preserved Lemon Skewers \n\n3/4 cup (6 oz./185 g) plain whole-milk yogurt \n1 tsp. ground cumin \nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper \n1 1/2 lb. (750 g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts \n1 1/2 lb. (750 g) asparagus, ends trimmed \n2 Tbs. olive oil \n2 preserved lemons, drained, preserving liquid reserved \n\nIn a large, nonreactive bowl, stir together the yogurt, cumin, turmeric, paprika, saffron, cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. \n\nCut the chicken into 1 1/2-inch (4-cm) cubes. Add the chicken to the bowl and toss to coat well. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours. \n\nPreheat an oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. \n\nIn a large bowl, toss the asparagus with the olive oil and the reserved preserved lemon liquid (about 1 Tbs.). Set aside. Cut the lemons into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. \n\nDrain the skewers and thread them with chicken and lemons. Place the skewers in a single layer on half of the baking sheet. Bake until the chicken is opaque throughout, about 15 minutes. Using tongs, flip the skewers over. Spread the asparagus in a single layer next to the skewers on the baking sheet. Cook until the chicken is roasted throughout and the asparagus is fork-tender, about 12 minutes. Serve immediately.
