There was a worry that they had met up and he wasn’t being truthful to her. \n“Kylie has ditched her ring. She just wants to move on.” \nBut Spanish actress Marta is believed to be devastated at the accusations. \nShe spent last weekend being consoled by her close friend Karolina Wydra in New York. \nPosting on Instragram, she wrote: “Thank you for hugging me all weekend Karolina. I don’t know what I would do without you.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Kylie Minogue on the red carpet with Joshua Sasse Share this video Watch Next \nMarta is currently holed up with pals in Los Angeles. \nA friend added: “Marta wouldn’t want to get caught up in something like this, she is very upset by the whole thing.” \nJoshua met Marta while making the show No Tomorrow in Vancouver. \nFilming started in August and ended in December. \nA source who worked on it said it was “well known” on set that he and Marta were close. \nBut her brother Alfonso said he had “no idea at all” about any liaison. \nIronically in Marta’s 2010 showreel, the first scene is taken from a short film titled Scandal in which she has been thrust into the limelight after a sex tape leak. \nShe can be seen shouting: “Everything thinks I’m a whore.” \nMeanwhile Joshua has been staying at his parents’ house in Herefordshire. He refused to comment yesterday. \nEarlier this week Kylie confirmed the split with an emotive image of a sunrise over calm waters on Instagram. \nShe captioned the picture: “We wish only the best for each other as we venture towards new horizons.” \nJoshua met Kylie in summer 2015 on the set of musical ­comedy Galavant. \nAfter their engagement last February, there were rumours that they had married in secret last summer. \nIn October they announced they wouldn’t wed until Australia legalises gay marriage. \nIn an ­interview in August, Joshua said: “She is just the most unbelievable bundle of joy. It’s magic, it’s ­excitement and joy and sex.” \nPals of Kylie, who is planning to make a new album, say she had a “lucky escape” from Joshua. \nHer previous boyfriends ­include Neighbours co-star Jason Donovan, INXS singer Michael Hutchence, fellow rocker Lenny Kravitz, French actor Olivier Martinez and Spanish model Andres Velencoso. \nJust weeks ago, Kylie hinted she had no plans to marry Joshua, saying: “Mum isn’t buying a hat.” \nLater she posted online: “Thank you now for your love and understanding with the news that Josh and I have decided to go our separate ways.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:13:40.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
