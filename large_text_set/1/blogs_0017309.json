Roadworks, including for the cycle superhighways, are also a factor. \nTransport committee chair Caroline Pidgeon said: “Something dramatic has to be done about the enormous congestion problem on London’s roads. The issue is costing our city money and costing Londoners their health and wellbeing. A quarter of London traffic was at a complete halt during Tube strike \n“TfL is doing a lot to tackle congestion, but not enough. Road pricing would be a fairer approach as road users would pay according to how much they contribute to congestion. \n“Gridlocked London needs to start moving again and tinkering here and there is not going to achieve that. The time has come for the Mayor to take a look at road pricing before things get any worse.” \nThe report, London Stalling, said that planned new charges for emissions, proposed road tolls and vehicle excise duty should be integrated into one single road pricing scheme. \nMinicabs, which are exempt from the C-charge, should also be included. \nThe committee admitted the proposal would not be universally popular but published research showing that half of motorists would back it, with just a fifth against. \nThe poll also found it had the potential to change driver behaviour by encouraging them to drive at less congested times or switch to public transport, cycling and walking. \nOther recommendations included reducing restrictions on night-time deliveries, bringing in a workplace parking levy and considering a ban on personal deliveries for staff at their workplace. \nThe report said TfL should reconsider “click and collect” for online shopping at Tube and rail stations. \nIt suggested more could be done to reduce the impact of roadworks, many of which were caused by TfL itself as it modernised the roads network. \nBusiness groups welcomed the road pricing proposal, with some caveats. \nColin Stanbridge of the London Chamber of Commerce said: “The congestion charge no longer serves the purpose for which it was created and we would not oppose targeted charging in principle. \n“However our concern would be that businesses are not used as a money-spinner and any new scheme takes into account the economic value of a journey. \n“Excessive new congestion charging on delivery vehicles will end up reflected in prices that customers will pay”.
