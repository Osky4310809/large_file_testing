While they have made the right noises about wanting him to return, Timmons should find plenty of teams interested in his services. Expected to command a salary in the region of $6 million to $8 million a year, Timmons could easily receive offers outside the range the Steelers are willing to pay.\nA significant part of the Steelers defense for the last 10 years, Timmons will be 31 years old when training camp begins and the signs of a long career are already beginning to show. Even though the linebacker looks to have a few years left in him, extending aging veterans has not always worked out well for the Steelers. Ultimately, Pittsburgh might be better served moving on from him this offseason and looking for a younger option in free agency.\nRelated: DeAngelo Williams and Roosevelt Nix having fun on vacation in Finland \nWith the 49ers looking to switch to a 4-3 defense in 2017, inside linebacker Gerald Hodges becomes surplus to requirements and could be the ideal replacement for Timmons. Selected in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings, Hodges was traded to the San Francisco in 2015 for center Nick Easton and a sixth-round draft pick following something of a breakout season the year before. Filling in for an injured Anthony Barr, Hodges was able to prove himself among a deep linebackers group making him valuable trade bait when the Vikings found themselves in need of a center after an injury to their starter.\nConsidered more of a coverage linebacker coming out of Penn State, Hodges has shown this is a strength of his game since being in the league. At 26 years old, he is entering his prime and is coming off his best season as a professional. A year in which he recorded 83 tackles, three sacks, and two interceptions.\n\nAt 6-foot-2 and 236-pounds, Hodges offers similar size to Timmons, but in a younger, faster package. His skills against the run are not at the level of Timmons, but he offers better talent in the passing game. There are some questions to be answered about a violation of team rules that saw him made inactive for one game late last year, but his coaches have spoken highly of his contributions.\nKnown as something of a high energy guy with a relentless motor, Hodges looks to be capable of being a three-down player for the Steelers. Pro Football Focus gave him a grade of 82.4 for last season, Timmons, by comparison, was given a grade of 48.4. Hodges enters free agency somewhat under the radar coming from one of the worst defenses in football last year. Consequently, Pittsburgh may well be able to sign him for a contract that averages significantly less than the $6 million a year Timmons looks set to earn, yet have much more upside to him.\nSteeler Nation may want to see number 94 retire as a Steeler, but the front office might do well to put emotion aside and make a change to a younger model this offseason.\nRelated: Bruce Arians believes Ben Roethlisberger will play in 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:40:14.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
