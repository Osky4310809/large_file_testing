Two popular gaming forums have been hacked, and the account data for 2.5 million users has been released.\nAccording to security expert, Troy Hunt’s Have I Been Pwned data tracking website, the Xbox360 and PSP ISOs were hacked back in September of 2015. Even though this incident happened nearly two years ago, it is just now coming to light. The data is composed of email addresses, account passwords, and IP addresses. Even if users didn’t have any of their financial data stored on the sites, the information could still be used to log into other sites if they used the same password on them.\n“Often people using seemingly low-security websites don’t enforce good password security because it’s not a financial target,” said IT Security Specialist at ESET, Mark James. “but all data has a value and will be reused for other purposes. Every website should be treated as unique and require different passwords with a mix of usernames if possible.”\n“Breach after breach has shown that using the same username and password for multiple sites is a bad idea,” according to security expert Jonathan Sander of Lieberman Software. “If the Xbox and PSP crew haven’t learned that they can’t use the same email and password on every service by now, then likely it is game over for their personal data.”\nIf you are or were a member of either site, you should definitely change your passwords as soon as possible. Also, it might be a wise idea to stay away from sites where you can illegally download games. As the security experts pointed out, these sort of sites don’t have great password security so avoiding them entirely might be the best course of action. Seriously, though, please buy games and don’t steal them.
