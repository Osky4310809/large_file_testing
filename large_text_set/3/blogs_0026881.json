Earnest served as former President Barack Obama’s third press secretary, after Robert Gibbs and Jay Carney. \nCo-host Savannah Guthrie joked while welcoming Earnest, “Now you have to wear your analyst hat, not your Democrat hat.” \nEarnest’s first opportunity came moments later when Guthrie and co-host Matt Lauer quizzed him over the Republicans’ failure to repeal and replace Obamacare with the American Health Care Act. \n“This is so unfair to do to you on your first day,” Lauer quipped at one point. \nNBC News President Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC President Phil Griffin confirmed Earnest’s new role in a memo sent out Monday. \nJosh recently completed a ten-year run with President Obama, most recently serving as White House Press Secretary from 2014-17. A native of Kansas City, Josh graduated from Rice University with a degree in political science and policy studies. With his wealth of experience and insight, Josh will be a great addition to our roster of contributors and will be an asset for our two networks as we continue to cover the White House, Congress and politics beyond the Beltway. \nEarnest joins many of his predecessors in making the jump from the White House to cable or network news. \nCarney joined CNN after leaving the White House while Gibbs went to work for MSNBC. Dana Perino, former press secretary under President George W. Bush, was hired by Fox News and former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer worked for CNN from 2011-2013. Tony Snow, who also served as press secretary under George W. Bush, joined CNN in 2007, about a year before succumbing to cancer. \nEarnest will be based in NBC News’ Washington, D.C., bureau, according to The Hill .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:47:09.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
