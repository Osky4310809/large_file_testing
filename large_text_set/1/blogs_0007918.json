It doesn’t bother me,” the Planned Parenthood executive said, according to the panel’s report. \nIt’s none of her concern … classy. You’d think the sale of body parts of innocents would concern people in general but apparently this is one instance of capitalism that the Lefties approve. \nOther disturbing findings from the House Panel’s Planned Parenthood findings (via The Daily Signal ): \nSeveral Planned Parenthood affiliates made a profit from the transfer of aborted body parts and other fetal tissue, in violation of federal law prohibiting that. \nPlanned Parenthood abortion doctors would huddle with a tissue procurement technician from Novogenix to learn what aborted body parts that outside person was searching for that day. \nPlanned Parenthood doctors appear to have altered their techniques to increase the chances of success in harvesting tissue from abortions that day. \nGhouls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T04:29:21.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
