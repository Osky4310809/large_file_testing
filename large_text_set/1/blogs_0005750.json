However he hasn't been able to find his form since, not scoring in 22 league appearances with the Dynamo. \nA loan move to Cruz Azul this year also proved unsuccessful as he managed just three appearances for the Liga MX side, not scoring a goal. \nNow back with Houston, Torres is looking to rediscover the form he had with Chivas USA and Cabrera, who was his head coach with the now-defunct MLS franchise in 2014, is hopeful he’ll be able to help him do just that. \n“I’m going to try to help him, with his teammates, to explode his talent,” Cabrera told MLSsoccer.com . “That’s something that is not going to change from me from what we did in Chivas (USA).” \nThe key, according to Cabrera, is for Torres, who is still just 23 years old, to actually find the back of the net with the Dynamo. Once that happens, the Dynamo boss believes things will fall into place. \n“He needs to bring his confidence back,” Cabrera said. “How? By every day working in practice and scoring some goals. When he scores one goal, everything is going to change for him. He just needs to score one goal.” \nTorres will have his work cut out for him to earn a place in the lineup. Even though he remains a designated player for the Dynamo, Houston revamped its attacking force early in the offseason, bringing in Honduran internationals Alberth Elis and Romell Quioto, while 21-year-old Mauro Manotas finally broke through last season for the squad, scoring six times in 22 games. \nHowever, Torres will have a chance to show he belongs as Dynamo general manager Matt Jordan insists all spots will be open for competition in a squad which finished bottom of the Western Conference in 2016. \n“For all of our players, it’s a clean slate and a fresh start,” said Jordan. “And it’s going to be an open competition, and what’s important is that internal competition to help raise the level of the team.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:48:09.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
