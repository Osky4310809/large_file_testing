It’s clean, that monitor is well mounted to the wall, and oh hey—the PC is actually built into the desk . Here are some more photos. Advertisement \nThe Dell U3415W ultrawide being mounted to the wall is already a great start, but beyond that the desk is made from reclaimed wood, and a completely DIY job. Just for reference, zbeegniev is also YetAnotherTechChannel on YouTube, and he posted this build video for the desk itself: \nHere’s a good shot of the computer, built into a drawer of the desk, pulled out so you can see all of the components: \nAnd here’s another one, closer up on the components that power that PC, including its water cooling rig and the Core i7 6700K that’s at the core of the system: \nNow that the whole thing is put together though, here’s another shot, top down of the work surface itself: \nAnd here’s a close-up shot of that Creative amp over on the side that’s connected to the speakers on either side of the setup: \nThere are a ton more photos at the link below, including shots around the office, of the NAS and other storage devices zbeegniev is using in the setup, and a few more of the desk and the desk-built PC, if you’re eager to take a peek. Hit the links below, and then check out the full thread at Reddit for more. If you head over there, let him know how much we like the workspace, and give him your upvotes while you’re at it!

Make sure any photos you include are at least 1280x720. Keeping them to 16:9helps, too! Include a little text about the stuff you used, how you came up with the design, and any other relevant details. If your clever organization and good design sense catch our eye, you might be the next featured workspace!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:11:08.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
