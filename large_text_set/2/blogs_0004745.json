Both will want excellent displays, great performance, sturdy build and good cameras in their next smartphone. However, while a premium smartphone mostly guarantees all the bells and whistles you could possibly think of, the same is not the case with budget smartphones. More often than not, buyers have to compromise on performance when buying a budget device. That is until Honor launched the successor to the 5X, dubbed the Honor 6X . Powered by a homebred Kirin SoC, the 6X definitely packs a punch, which is why we decided to test the smartphone and give you a detailed insight on its capabilities. Before we run any benchmarks on the Honor 6X, let’s get its specs out of the way as it lives up to its tag of the “Swag Phone” . The Honor 6X flaunts a unibody metal design and is powered by a Kirin 655 octa-core processor. Four of the eight available cores have been clocked at 2.1GHz, while the remaining four are clocked at 1.7GHz. A Mali-T830 MP2 GPU has been tasked with handling the graphics with the smartphone shipping with 3GB or 4GB of RAM for multi-tasking. For the purpose of this article, we’ll be using the 3GB RAM variant. A fingerprint sensor can be found on the back, below the smartphone’s dual camera setup, which features a pair of 12MP and 2MP sensors. The device is fuelled by a 3,340mAh battery and runs Android Marshmallow. \nNow that we have the basics out of the way, let’s see if the Kirin processor on the Honor 6X can compete with the likes of a Qualcomm Snapdragon. Starting off with the AnTuTu benchmark, the smartphone scored an impressive total score of 56,759 on the app. What’s interesting is that the CPU score of the Honor 6X is higher than Xiaomi Redmi Note 4’s CPU score, which runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor. Moving on to GeekBench, the Honor 6X scored 780 on the single-core test and 3,330 on the multi-core test. To give you a better picture, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 scored 813 in the single-core test and just 2,921 on the multi-core test. Therefore, while the Redmi Note 4 is marginally better in single-core performance, the Honor 6X has an edge when it comes to multi-core tests.Even the quadrant benchmark painted a similar picture, where Honor’s 6X scored 17,699 compared to Xiaomi Redmi Note 4’s overall score of 16,246. Since benchmarks quite often don’t paint the complete picture, we tested the Honor 6X with some intensive games. Prospective buyers will be glad to hear that the smartphone offered good frame rates with every single game we played on it. Be it car crashes on Asphalt 8 or the intensive gun fights on Modern Combat 5 , we didn’t come across any major lag or stutter. In conclusion, the Honor 6X is not just a great pocket-shooter or a stylish device, but also an excellent gaming companion with great battery life. If you were on the fence about buying the smartphone, we hope this performance overview clears some of your doubts. Register yourselves for the next sale of the 6X on Honor’s e-commerce site .
