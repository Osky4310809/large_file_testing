Our CEO Rajeev Suri said it loud and clear to all present at Mobile World Congress 2017 in his keynote speech . It starts with developing technologies that deliver social progress, more efficient industries for a more sustainable planet. But we are also convinced that business can reach its full potential for innovation and success when it creates shared value for communities, for our company business and employees and for our stakeholders. That makes me even prouder to be part of Nokia. \nBuilding on our corporate community investment approach, we aim to put technology to good use for communities around the world and the planet. We decided to focus on sustainability challenges where Nokia can make a real difference with the greatest positive impact on communities, in full alignment with our business drivers. Connecting the unconnected, empowering women, saving lives \nThree main themes drive our efforts – to connect the unconnected, to empower women and to save lives. Wherever possible we use our technology and know-how to do this. Our vision to expand the human possibilities of the connected world is not just a slogan, it’s part of our company’s DNA, and our way to create shared value. \nThese three themes are also aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and will help us to contribute to many of them, including partnering for the goals, better access to education, gender equality, reducing inequality, more sustainable communities and improved health. \nWe know we cannot reach these SDG goals alone. Driving our social investment forward in 2017, we are delighted to initiate new collaboration with key NGOs. Together we’ll deliver 7 new programs in 2017 with positive impacts for communities all around the world. Diversity is strength \nWomen and girls make up at least 50% of the world’s population but are still heavily under-represented in business, especially in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. Firstly, we are supporting the following four new projects that aim to encourage young people – particularly girls – into STEM based careers: \ngreenlight for girls helps inspire young women in science. The aim is to engage participants aged 11 – 15 from local schools, ideally with at least 20% coming from less advantaged communities, with hands-on Science & Technology workshops and activities run by role-model professionals. In 2017, we aim to create initiatives for girls in 11 countries spanning the regions where we operate. \nCodebus Africa runs 1-day creative coding workshops for youth – especially girls – in 10 African countries during spring 2017. It brings the power of Finland’s Aalto University, Mehackit, Finnish embassies and several African tech hubs, schools and private companies. \nRails Girls Summer of Code is a global fellowship program aimed at bringing more diversity into Open Source. Successful applicants are paid a monthly stipend, from July-September, to work on selected Open Source projects \nAnita Borg Institute connects, inspires and guides women in computing and organizations around the world that view technology innovation as an imperative. As an ABI partner, we take part in programming that helps our women technologists thrive at all levels of our company. \nFollow the CodeBus journey through Africa this Spring on Facebook : Nurturing young people \nWe are also sponsoring the HundrED education initiative that seeks the most inspiring innovations in education practices and creates a global sharing platform for teachers around the world. During 2017 the project focuses on finding hundred exciting educational practices from around the world. \nJA Worldwide (Junior Achievement) is partnering with Nokia to provide STEM Innovation Camps, an intensive 1-2 day competitive experience for students aged 15-18. Under the guidance of Nokia volunteers, young people will develop idea-generation and collaboration techniques, while developing a business plan in response to a given STEM challenge. The 2017 initiative will launch in 5 key countries across North & South America, and Europe. Saving and improving lives \nWe will support UNICEF during the next 2.5 years on their mHealth project in Indonesia for better health and nutrition in the country. The objective of this pilot project is to strengthen community capacity to take appropriate actions to safeguard the nutritional and health status of families and children under five. \nWe genuinely look forward to delivering on our promise with these great initiatives and with our partners, dedicated to making a positive change happen for people and communities worldwide.
