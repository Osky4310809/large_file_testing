Massive flaws in the reporting quickly became clear, however, as the sole source for the story told The Daily Caller his words were taken out of context, and journalists quickly dug up a statement from Perry on his nomination that explicitly mentions the nuclear arsenal.

They harshly criticized the paper in the meantime. \n“I officially retract my snarky Rick Perry tweet c/o the NYT,” writer Andrew Heaton tweeted. “I stand by my snarky Dancing with the Stars tweets.” Asked why he was retracting in a reply to his tweet, he added: “It appears the NYT had a pre-existing opinion and then slopped some dubious reporting on top to confirm.” \n“Im retracting last 2 tweets,” Vanity Fair editor and Newsweek senior writer Kurt Eichenwald tweeted. “Someone pointed out there are now questions if NYT allegations on Rick Perry are true.” \n“Since I tweeted the NYTimes story, I’ll tweet this repudiation from their source,” Huffington Post reporter Natalie Jackson tweeted. “Deleting my initial tweet.” \n“I still think experts are far better for running technical depts like Energy, though, but apologize for spreading bad story,” she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T21:39:11.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
