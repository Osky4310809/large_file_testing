Nigel Kinrade/LAT Photo USA 10 AJ Allmendinger \nThe ‘Dinger scored his first and only Premier Series victory at Watkins Glen in 2014. Along with the win, the driver of the No. 47 JTG Daugherty Racing Chevy has also earned 10 top fives and 48 top-10 finishes in 303 total races. 9 Robby Gordon \nWith three victories, 16 top fives and 39 top-10 results in 396 races at NASCAR’s highest level, Gordon ranks just ahead of Allmendinger. Getty Images Getty Images 8 Kyle Larson \nThe Chip Ganassi Racing driver earned his first career Monster Energy Series victory at Michigan International Speedway in August 2016. He’s currently on a streak of five consecutive runner-up finishes dating back to the 2016 season finale at Homestead. \nIf Larson continues on the road he's on, he'll move up on this list in no time. The Enthusiast Network The Enthusiast Network 7 Dan Gurney \nAlthough Gurney never participated in a full-time Premier Series season, he earned five victories, eight top fives and 10 top-10 finishes in just 16 races over 10 years. 6 Dick Rathman \nFrom 1951 through 1955, Rathman participated in 129 Premier Series events, scoring 13 wins, 69 top fives and 79 top-10 finishes.

Thacker/LAT Photo USA Matthew T. Thacker 3 Kevin Harvick \nFollowing Dale Earnhardt’s death in 2001, Harvick took over the No. 3 Richard Childress Racing Chevy and scored his first career Cup win at Atlanta in just his third race. \nSince then, the Bakersfield native has earned one championship (2014), 35 total wins, 154 top fives and 286 top 10s. Getty Images Jonathan Moore 2 Jeff Gordon \nThe four-time Cup champion and current FOX NASCAR analyst claims two different hometowns – Vallejo, California and Pittsboro, Indiana. \nAfter starting in quarter-midgets in California, Gordon moved to the Hoosier State to move his way up the open-wheel sprint car ranks. \nSince his first full-time Premier Series season in 1993, Gordon racked up an incredible 93 career wins, 325 top fives, 477 top-10 finishes and 81 poles. \nHe retired from full-time competition in 2015, earning his final victory at Martinsville that fall. \nGordon falls a close second to the driver of the car he co-owns. Getty Images Chris Trotman 1 Jimmie Johnson \nAfter Johnson tied Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt with a remarkable seven Premier Series championship, he solidified his case for being at the top of this list. \nJohnson earned his first career Cup victory in his home state after winning at Auto Club Speedway in 2002. \nSince then, he and longtime crew chief Chad Knaus have earned 80 victories, 218 top fives and 331 top-10 finishes. \nIf Johnson can score a record eighth championship before it's all said and done, the debate of whether or not he's NASCAR's G.O.A.T. will officially be laid to rest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:59:45.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
