Shoppers just order online from AmazonFresh’s selection, pick a time slot (as soon as 15 minutes after you make your order), and then drive to an AmazonFresh Pickup location and pull into a parking space, where your groceries will be loaded directly into your car by a service agent within a few minutes. \nThe service is bundled as a free addition for Amazon Prime subscribers, adding a significant new feature to the company’s existing list of Prime features. There’s also no minimum order, so if you want to pick up just a tube of toothpaste – well, you do you. \nAvailable items include fresh produce, meats, brea, dairy and a range of household items, among others. The Program is actually limited to Amazon employees only for now, since it’s in beta, but once it’s open for a broader audience it’ll be available to all Prime members. There’s also a geographic limitation, which means only those located near Seattle’s SODO and Ballard neighbourhoods, where the company’s two current AmazonFresh Pickup locations reside, can participate. \nAmazon has been exploring a range of different ways to rethink grocery shopping, and this looks like another interesting experiment blending traditional shopping with its own ecommerce model. AmazonFresh has been slow to expand geographically, but if this proves promising, it might help with those efforts to grow that aspect of the business. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T17:18:29.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
