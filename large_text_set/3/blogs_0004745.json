Alhaji Sulaiman Ririwai, Commissioner for Water Resources and Rural Development, made this known in Kano that the project had commenced in Doguwa Local Government Area. Ririwai said the state also planned to rehabilitate some dams to complement the existing 20 dams in enhancing irrigation and providing drinking water for animals in the rural areas. “Kano State as a whole has ground water problem and that is why the first governor of the state, Alhaji Audu Bako, constructed the 20 dams,’’ the commissioner said. He said the state government had started construction of 5, 000 hand pump and motorised boreholes across the 44 local governments to provide potable water for rural dwellers. “As I am talking to you now, over 1, 500 of such boreholes have been completed while about 2, 000 would be completed before the end of the year,’’ Ririwai. According to him, the state government will soon supply water to Rano from Tiga Dam in order to end the perennial water scarcity in the ancient town. “To address the Rano water problem, the government is planning to lay 42-kilometre pipe from Tiga Dam to the town. “By the time the project is completed, the problem of water in Rano will be history,” the commissioner said. On roads, Ririwai said the state government had started constructing 52 rural roads totalling 500 kilometres in each of the three senatorial districts under its rural access mobility programme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:32:56.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
