And since the show will be concluding after its eighth season (airing in 2018), Williams is savoring these moments and beginning to wonder what her life will be like without its job security to fall back on. \"It has been my security blanket and it's been a safety net,\" Williams told ET . \"If I haven't worked, or if I haven't landed a role, I never beat myself up too much, because I've always got Game of Thrones . To not have that around is going to be really strange, but it's also really exciting. It means I can now shape my career and I'm not tied down to anything, and I can really make bold decisions.\" And how is she approaching Arya Stark's final scenes? \"I'm just trying to do the last few scenes that I have justice,\" she explained. \"I'm just trying to shape Arya the way that I have been so far, and give her a nice arc to end with, and hope the people are happy with it.\" \nGame of Thrones is currently filming its penultimate seventh season. The new season will consist of seven episodes. \nGame of Thrones returns to HBO in summer 2017.
