You get defensive every time you like someone. Because you’re guarded or you don’t want to get hurt so your body enters into defensive mode blocking you from being approachable, soft or vulnerable. \n2. You think everyone is like your ex. You think everyone is going to treat you the way your ex treated you or they will eventually turn out to be the same person. This mentality subconsciously stops you from giving someone a fair chance because in the back of your mind, you think that it’s only a matter of time before they break your heart.\n3. You still can’t get over your heartbreak. When you’re still hurting, you’re not going to be as giving or as loving as you normally would be because you’re still trying to mend the broken pieces of your heart. Take the time to heal before you start dating again.\n4. You’re using work as an excuse. You’re working too hard or too much to keep yourself busy so you don’t think about it or feel like you’re missing out on love. But sometimes when you shut yourself off and focus on only one aspect of your life, you lose balance and it causes even more problems.\n5. You’re only attracted to a certain type of people. Who are probably also emotionally unavailable because that’s what you’re used to. If you start breaking that habit and letting go of the type that never works for you, you might give yourself a chance to experience love in a different, better way.\n6. You’re indecisive. One day you love being single, one day you hate it. One day you like someone, the next day you change your mind. When you’re not sure about what you’re looking for in a partner, you’ll likely make wrong decisions. Take the time to really think about the qualities you need and the kind of relationship you want to be in.\n7. You’re not thinking about the future. You date people you don’t see a future with or people you know are wrong for you, just for the sake of dating which makes you stay with people you shouldn’t be with.\n8. You’re acting out of loneliness not out of love. You date people because you’re lonely not because you’re really interested in them. Loneliness is dangerous because it can cloud your judgment and make you believe that you’re compatible with someone when you’re not. Let your intuition guide you in these situations.\n9. You don’t want to take a risk. If someone doesn’t approach you, you never will. If someone doesn’t tell you that they like you, you won’t say anything. You’re playing it too safe and that can push some people away because they’re going to think you’re indifferent or you don’t even care.\n10. You think you’re ‘cursed.’ Even though you say it jokingly, when you subconsciously think that you’re cursed when it comes to love, you may be speaking it into existence. Maybe it’s just not the right time and you haven’t found the right person yet, but this is not a curse, this is simply dating in the 21st century. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T21:04:35.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
