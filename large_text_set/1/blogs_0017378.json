Did you know that Ariana Grande has an actual twin , but they’re not related?! What we mean is, Grande has a doppelgänger, reported E! News, and we can’t believe they’re not twins IRL.\nWho is the alleged twin? Twenty-year-old Jacky Vasquez. Judging by all her Instagram followers, all 211,000 of them, you’d think she’s a superstar singer , too. (Though, tbh, Grande has 94.5 million Insta followers rn, so there’s a bit of a difference.)\nIn the comments of Vasquez’s posts, many people have noticed the resemblance between her and Grande. Sometimes, Vasquez does her makeup and poses like Grande , too, so it is pretty convincing. Take a look for yourself.\nHere’s Ariana Grande. baby don't you know, all of them tears gon come and go ♡ \nA photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jan 13, 2017 at 9:16pm PST \nHere’s Jacky Vasquez. My bday is in 17 days and idk how I wanna look thinking bout changing my hair color but I'm not sure 🤔 #ombre #brunnette or #redhair \nA photo posted by Jacky Vasquez (@jackyvasquez) on Dec 17, 2016 at 11:32am PST \nA -mazing, right?! Our minds are ~blown~.\nLet’s look at a few more.\nHere’s Grande with her renowned ponytail.\ni think you're sw lll #goclovers \nA photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Dec 10, 2016 at 10:29am PST \nAnd here’s Vasquez in a ponytail.\nA photo posted by Jacky Vasquez (@jackyvasquez) on Dec 2, 2016 at 2:10pm PST \nAnd here’s Grande as a cat (of course).\n♡ \nA photo posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Dec 25, 2016 at 9:56am PST \nAnd here’s Vasquez as a cat.\n\nA photo posted by Jacky Vasquez (@jackyvasquez) on Jan 20, 2017 at 1:23pm PST \nCr zy.\n“I honestly never thought I looked like Ariana,” Vasquez told E! News. “I would see a little resemblance in pictures and videos, but that wasn’t until people would point it out… She’s so beautiful, so it kinda boosts my self-esteem when people tell me that. I honestly don’t know she feels about the comparisons but to me, it’s a huge compliment!” We’d take it as a huge compliment, too. Though the two women do look alike, they have some differences. For instance, Vasquez is based in Virginia and works as a waitress — sometimes, customers make the you-look-like-Ariana-Grande connection, too, according to Vasquez’s Instagram.\nAlthough some people online are nice to Vasquez about the resemblance — and seemingly stunned, judging by Insta comments — others are not.\n“I’ve gotten so much hate from her fans, it’s unbelievable,” Vasquez told E! News. “Half of her fandom are very sweet and nice to me but the other half are the meanest people I’ve ever seen online.” Ahhh, internet trolls at it again. (Why, trolls, why?!) However, some people truly embrace Vasquez’s Grande look.\n“I remember I got mistaken in Washington D.C. because she was at the Verizon Center that day and I dressed up like her since she was in town,” Vasquez said in an interview with Sweety High. “People asked me to take pictures with them that day, it was so fun!” We’ll leave you with one final pic of the two women.\nLate post but I seriously didn't have time yesterday. Just wanted to wish @arianagrande a happy 23rd birthday!!! She's my girl, my bad bitch, my favorite! I haven't met her yet but damn, when that day comes ima shit my pants lol hope she had a great birthday, I love her like a sis ❤️ #happybirthdayariana #arianagrande \nA photo posted by Jacky Vasquez (@jackyvasquez) on Jun 27, 2016 at 11:40am PDT \nW-o-w! We’re still amazed at how much Vasquez looks like Grande and curious if Grande knows she has a twin. We’re also in the mood to listen to some Ariana Grande right now.
