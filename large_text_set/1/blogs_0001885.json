Junior hockey, grown up hockey, college football, basketball — there’s no shortage of games to watch as we gleefully kick 2016 to the curb. Can’t get any better than that, right? Hahaha WRONG. \nAfter what we’ll say is overwhelming demand, it was decided that Minnie the Corgi would take over the Sacramento Kings’ Twitter account during their final game of the year:\nIf this gets 1,000 RTs Minnie the Corgi will take over our Twitter for today's game! \nDeMarcus Cousins #NBAVote pic.twitter.com/J8owZdBpi6 \n— Sacramento Kings (@SacramentoKings) December 31, 2016 \n\nYeah yeah, I know what you’re saying. Danielle, come on, corgis have those stumpy little legs and no opposable thumbs, how is she going to tweet? And to that I say literally who cares . She wears a tiny dog jersey, makes puns, and is a very good sports dog. And we all know there’s nothing Uproxx Sports loves more than a good sports dog . Minnie is arguably the greatest basketball communications specialist of our time.

What is happening in California? \n\nMinnie also got some face time with Slamson, the Kings’ mascot who looks like Mr. Mistoffelees got stung by a bee on a day he didn’t have his EpiPen with him:\n. @SlamsonTheLion and I are going to get this rally started!
