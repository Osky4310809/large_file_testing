If we factor in high-powered women in Europe as well, such as Angela Merkel, it seems we are witnessing a seismic shift for women to accede to high-level positions in politics and society,\" he said.\n“I welcome these signs of women’s liberation. But there may still be a gap between those women achieving high public status and those in the private sector.\"\nThen Morgan asked Hawking if he was a feminist. The scientist replied:\n\"Yes, I have always supported women’s rights. I moved the admission of women to my college, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The results were wholly good.\"\nWATCH: Stephen Hawking, Russian billionaire launch $100 million search for extraterrestrial life", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/843754934340390912", "https://twitter.com/GMB", "https://t.co/sSQamLgrae", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/WF9CrBoC.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/WF9CrBoC.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-20T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T13:19:11.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
