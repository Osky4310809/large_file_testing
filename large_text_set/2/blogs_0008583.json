Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Burnley may be disappointing on a certain level, but it’s also a point gained away from the Bridge and at one of the tougher places to play this season. Only Spurs and Chelsea have won more home games than Burnley, while the 9 wins also match Arsenal’s home total. Chelsea have lost both away at Spurs and away at Arsenal this season and without even scoring a goal. “Apart from one they've got all of their points at home so they're a really difficult side to play against away. The pitch wasn't good, obviously it was very cold so it wasn't the ideal situation but I think we started very well and we scored.” “We then conceded the free-kick and with the quality of Robbie Brady you knew it could be a goal. He shot it very well and then we couldn't repeat our game from the first 15-20 minutes. We couldn't create chances and I don't think we had a big chance in the second half. In the end maybe we can be happy with a point but we always want to win.” Maybe we can, though in the end what will matter is the next game and the next game and the game after that. Chelsea remain firmly in control of our destiny and with a nice cushion to spare. No problemo. “We just take it game by game and we don't look at who is behind us. We just try to win our games and we will see. The Premier League is very hard with away games against teams like Burnley.” “We still have to go to West Ham and Stoke, they're always hard, but we have to work like we have been doing for the past months and we will be fine.” -Thibaut Courtois; source: Chelsea FC Chelsea have six away games left: West Ham, Stoke, Bournemouth, Manchester United, Everton, West Bromwich Albion. The home schedule looks markedly easier, with only Manchester City possibly posing a significant danger. So, if we assume that we win all seven of the remaining home games — Chelsea have won 11 of 12 at home, losing just the once to Liverpool — we’d need about 10 points from the six away games to guarantee a title. That may not be an exact total, but it’s in the ballpark. So that’s three wins and a draw or two wins and four draws. Doable, even if somebody in the chasing pack decides to go on and match Chelsea’s 13-match winning streak from earlier in the season. We will be fine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:13:04.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
