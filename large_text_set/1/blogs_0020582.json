Fuoco / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nWith every new glance, the enduring desert drama begins anew. \nThe ferocity of the lunging male Barbary lion in mid-attack. The assaulted camel, its leg clawed and bloodied, bellowing in pain and terror. The fear and fight of the sabre-wielding, North African courier atop the dromedary. And all of that violence juxtaposed by the silent stillness of a female lion, fatally felled. \nFor more than a century, the striking tableau depicted in the diorama “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” has intrigued, captivated and enthralled visitors at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. \nWhy has this iconic exhibit so fascinated and stirred the imagination of everyone who gazes upon it? Is it the primal story of man vs. beast? Is it that the story’s ending is unknown? Is it the intensity of the action and sounds conjured by a creation that is motionless and mute? Is it all of that and more? \nWhatever it is, generations of Pittsburghers and other visitors to the museum have been so enamored of the diorama, known until this year as “Arab Courier Attacked by Lions,” that it is the museum’s most beloved and famous exhibit next to Dippy, its huge Diplodocus dinosaur. \nGiven that, and the 150-year anniversary of the exhibit’s creation by French naturalist and taxidermist Edouard Verreaux for the Paris Exposition of 1867, the diorama has been researched, restored, reinterpreted and relocated to a new display in a more prominent location — the first-floor foyer shared by the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History near the Carriage Drive entrance. It had previously been displayed on the second floor near the African Wildlife Hall. \nThe new title for the diorama is a translation of its original French name, Lion Attaquant un Dromadaire . \nThe redisplayed, restored and reinterpreted exhibit will be unveiled Saturday at noon during a free, daylong symposium sponsored by the museum and the University of Pittsburgh. Scholars and staff from the Carnegie Museums of Natural History and Art and from Pitt will discuss the historical and intellectual contexts of the piece in the morning and the museum process for reinterpretation and reinstallation in the afternoon. \nRegistration for the symposium, which includes free museum admission, can be made here . \nEric Dorfman, the natural history museum director, said it is fitting and symbolic to move and redisplay such an important piece at the intersection of the Museums of Art and Natural History. \n“It’s as much a 19th century piece of art as it is a piece of natural history,” said Mr. Dorfman, who holds a Ph.D. in ecology. “Why not put it in a place where more people can come and engage with it? \n“I have grandparents telling me they looked at the object when they were tiny children. It’s very special to Pittsburgh, very exciting. To me, bringing out stories and making it more prominent is exactly the thing we are trying to do throughout the Museum of Natural History.” \nAnd, boy, does this natural history/taxidermy art exhibit have stories to tell, with more and more uncovered as research continues on a piece that excites and intrigues museum scholars as much as museumgoers. \nTake, for example, the recent discovery via a CT scan that the courier’s head contains an entire human skull. Museum officials had known for years that human teeth were in the courier’s mouth but did not know about the skull. For decades, an urban legend circulated about other human remains in the mannequin. \nX-rays of the entire exhibit using new technology provided by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s office showed there are no other human remains in the mannequin but bones are present in the animals, whose skins are real. The Barbary lion is now extinct. \nAs for the human skull, Erin Peters, the museum’s assistant curator of science and research, said that normally the museum would discuss repatriation, or returning human remains to their native land, but there is no way to document where it is from. \nMoreover, Gretchen E. Anderson, who heads the museum’s conservation section, said removing the skull would destroy the mannequin’s head because it is sculpted directly to it. \nMs. Peters, who holds a Ph.D. in art history and also is a Pitt lecturer in History of Art and Architecture, said her research discovered a stereoscopic image of the exhibit from the Paris exhibition, where it was considered a masterwork, as it is today. The image shows the rider in a more upright, commanding position than its current position of being slumped over in the saddle. Why and where this was done is unknown. \nThe photograph also provided proper credit for the diorama to Edouard Verreaux instead of his brother, Jules, also a taxidermist. For more than a century, the museum believed Jules Verreaux had created the piece. \nTwo years after the Paris Exposition, the piece was purchased by the American Museum of Natural History in New York where it remained in storage for three decades. The museum came to believe the piece too theatrical, too gauche, and thus not scientifically worthy of museum display. \nIn 1896, two years after it opened, the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh purchased it for only $50 — and had to pay $45 to have it shipped by rail here where it has been displayed ever since. \nMs. Peters said new labeling for the exhibit — as well as discussions during the symposium Saturday — will provide insight into the exhibit’s depiction of the courier in the context of 1867 Parisian interpretation of North African culture. Its artistic style was typical in the late 19th century but is now viewed as a stereotyped, colonialist misrepresentation of North Africa and the Middle East. \nThe symposium will culminate with a response and community discussion led by the outreach coordinator for the Muslim Association of Greater Pittsburgh. \nMichael A.
