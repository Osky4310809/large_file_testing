Ford CEO Mark Fields wants the robotic car done by 2021, writing in a statement that the company believes “Argo AI will create significant value” for shareholders. \nThe $1 billion investment in Argo will be spread over a five-year period. \nThis news follows Pittsburgh being named by the U.S. Department of Transportation as one of 10 testing grounds nationwide of autonomous vehicles, Uber’s world-wide debut of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh and the Department of Defense investing $250 million in a Carnegie-Mellon advanced robotics manufacturing institute in the city. \nMayor William Peduto praised Ford for the decision. \n“Pittsburgh continues to make global headlines on this growing industry, which stems from the hard work and brainpower of our friends at Carnegie Mellon, and the many industries they continue to seed and grow throughout our region,” Peduto said. “I want to thank Ford for banking on all Pittsburgh has to offer.” \nThis is a developing story, watch Jon Delano’s report in the 6 p.m. news for more information. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
