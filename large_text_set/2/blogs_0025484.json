What happens if Geert Wilders wins the Dutch election 2017? GEERT Wilders appears on track to win the Dutch election as anti-EU populism continues to sweep across Europe. But what happens if he wins? PUBLISHED: 15:26, Sun, Feb 26, 2017 | UPDATED: 15:45, Sun, Feb 26, 2017 \nThe anti-Islam leader of the Dutch far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) is leading in the polls ahead of the election next month. \nHis election would mark Europe’s first political earthquake of the year ahead of the important French and German elections later in 2017.

Key dates, Netherlands election explained \nMr Wilders has seized on the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s victory to further his own attempts to overturn the political status quo. \nThe far-right politician pledges to‘de-islamise’ the country by closing its borders, banning Islamic headscarves, closing mosques and banning the Koran. Getty What happens if Geert Wilders wins the Dutch election 2017? \nHe has vowed to take the Netherlands out of the EU as well stopping public money going towards development aid, windmills, the arts, innovation and broadcasting. \nBut what will really happens if Mr Wilders triumphs in the election next month? \nAlthough Mr Wilders is projected to get the most votes in the election, the PVV will not be able to form a Government on its own. \nUnlike Britain, the Netherlands is always ruled by a coalition of political parties due to the fragmented nature of Dutch politics. \nWinning the most seats does not automatically make Mr Wilders Prime Minister because the top job goes to the leader with the most seats in the coalition. Getty What would Geert Wilder's victory mean for German and French elections? \nThe latest weekly poll predicts that the PVV will win 29 of the 76 seats needed to form a coalition in the House of Representatives in the Netherlands. \nThe current ruling party, the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), looks likely to get the second largest number of seats in March. \nBut Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has already ruled out a coalition between VVD and the PVV if Mr Wilders wins the election as expected. \nOther Dutch parties are also unwilling to form a coalition with him, according to Rem Korteweg, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform (CER). \n“The result of that is going to be a political mess after the election,” Mr Korteweg said, noting that there could be political stalemate. \n“Wilders will claim that he has the will of the people. But there are very few - if any parties - that will go into Parliament with him.” Who is Geert Wilders?
