The latest such release for Android in the Google Play Store is Wolf of the BF:Commando, which is better known in the US simply as Commando.\nSee also: Best arcade games for Android July 11, 2016 The top-down vertical scrolling shooter features you as a Rambo or, yes, a Commando type of soldier (by the way, this game has no connection to the classic Arnold Schwarzenegger Commando movie). He’s a one-man army who can take out tons of troops with just one machine gun and a few grenades. \\\nThis new mobile version has two different modes of play. If you want to experience the gameplay as it was first created, you switch onto Classic Mode, but be prepared because it will be much harder to play. However, if you just want to have some fun, the new Casual Mode may be for you. It dumbs down the gameplay and you will likely have a more enjoyable experience while shooting through the waves of enemies.\n\nThe game also features global leaderboards, so you can compare your kill ratios with other players around the world, along with achievements to unlock. These last two features will require a Google account. Wolf of the BF:Commando Mobile is normally priced at $1.99, but for its launch you can purchase and download the game for just $0.99 from the Google Play Store for a limited time. The game also does not have any in-app purchases.\nGet it at Google Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:57:52.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
