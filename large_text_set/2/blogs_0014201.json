Asamoah Gyan \nIndividual match referees judge whether players’ haircuts are appropriate. \nSome match officials in the United Arab Emirates enforce the rules because they are concerned about children copying the styles. \nSimilar guidelines have been enforced in neighbouring countries. In 2012, Saudi Arabia goalkeeper Waleed Abdullah was told to cut his “un-Islamic” hair by the referee before playing for his club side Al Shabab. \nThe UAEFA sends a player’s club a warning letter in the first instance, with punishments escalating to a fine and then a suspension if he does not comply. \nGyan is one of 46 players at the warning letter stage. \nSource: BBC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:15:58.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
