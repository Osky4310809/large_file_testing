This inappropriate advertisement is airing during primetime when children are likely watching. It is extremely destructive and damaging to impressionable children viewing the commercial. \nGot that everyone? \nOne Million Moms ( Facebook Likes : 88,085) is telling parents not to take their kids to church. Gotta keep kids away from the concept of Hell… and even if that’s not their intention, it’s ridiculous that they’re freaking out over the far less offensive use of the word. \nMeanwhile, OMM’s parent company, American Family Association, is a group that actively promotes the pussy-grabbing President whose daily actions are far worse than anything Taco Bell has ever done.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:26:25.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
