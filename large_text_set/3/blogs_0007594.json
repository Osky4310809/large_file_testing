What is National Insurance? National Insurance contributions go into a fund that pays for the state pension and some other benefits They also help pay for the NHS National Insurance is deducted automatically from employees' salaries There are different classes of National Insurance payments, depending on people's employment status and how much they earn The self-employed currently pay a lower rate than those in employment The government says this was traditionally down to a lesser entitlement to benefits and pensions, but that these disparities have mostly been removed, so the difference in rates is unfair But critics say it is justified because self-employed people are not entitled to things like paid holiday and sickness leave \nThe prime minister defended the plans for National Insurance, saying the measures would ensure the tax system was fair, narrowing the gap between what employed and self-employed people paid. \nAt a press conference at the EU summit in Brussels, Mrs May said: \"People will be able to look at the government paper when we produce it, showing all our changes and take a judgment in the round. \n\"Of course the chancellor will be speaking - as will his ministers - to MPs, business people and others to listen to the concerns. \n\"But this is a change that leaves lower-paid self-employed workers better off, it's accompanied by more rights and protections for self-employed workers and it reforms the system of National Insurance to make it simpler, to make it fairer and to make it more progressive.\" Media caption Theresa May says the rise in National Insurance for the self-employed will make things fairer \nMore than a dozen Conservative MPs have criticised the Â£2bn National Insurance hit, including Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood, Anna Soubry and Dominic Raab. \nThe Conservatives' last general election manifesto explicitly ruled out rises in National Insurance, VAT and income tax during the lifetime of the current Parliament. \nWales Office minister Guto Bebb told BBC Radio Cymru: \"I believe we should apologise.\" \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron suggested the prime minister was worried about elections in May. \n\"Kicking the can down the road for a few weeks shows that the Conservatives are still planning to hit hard-working self-employed people but that they haven't the courage to say so this side of the local elections,\" he said. \nIn the wake of Mr Hammond's Budget announcement, ministers argued that legislation enshrining the manifesto commitment in law - approved by Parliament in 2015 - only referred to National Insurance contributions paid directly by employers and their employees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T07:24:42.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
