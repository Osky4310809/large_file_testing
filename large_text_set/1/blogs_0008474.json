Nissan says that it signals the company’s future sedan design direction and “Intelligent Mobility” technology. \nThe Vmotion 2.0 is the evolution of the “V-motion” front design signature seen on many of today’s Nissan cars. Vmotion 2.0 takes the look a step further by forming a 3D shape to create the volume and architecture of the vehicle. In this concept, the V-grille becomes the main fuselage, allowing for sharp yet expressive surface language, accented by crisp character lines throughout the body. \nThe car’s silhouette is characterized by a “floating roof,” with a line flowing seamlessly from the steeply-raked A-pillars to the trunk lip. A unique carbon finisher with thin silver threads accents the roof line. An extended wheelbase shows off the car’s generous cabin, while the distinctive body surface is defined by Nissan’s “Emotional Geometry” design language. \nAt the back, the boomerang-style taillights emphasise the width of the vehicle. Similar to the grille, the rear diffuser glows when the car operates in ProPILOT mode. \nThe front and rear doors swing outward, creating a large pillar-less open space. The dashboard continues the “Gliding Wing” design theme, which integrates the instrument panel and infotainment system for both the driver and passenger. The single continuous horizontal display integrates the ProPILOT graphic user interface (GUI). For rear passengers, the centre console features a smaller screen, which can serve as an extension of the main display. \nHighlights in the cabin include leather with a unique threadless quilting on the inserts that gives the “look of an exquisite handbag.” The steering wheel is designed to allow the driver and passenger to clearly see all the display infotainment without any interruption. The centre console’s simple layout includes a multi-function touchpad to operate the infotainment system. Natural Zebra Wood is applied on the floor and doors. \nBose UltraNearfield speakers including new sound management technology is built into the Vmotion 2.0’s seats. This technology increases situational awareness for drivers as it can control the direction and distance of sound to generate a 360-degree sound field around a driver. \nNissan Intelligent Mobility is the company’s roadmap to achieve zero emissions and zero fatalities. The lighting around the front Nissan emblem glows to indicate when the vehicle is in ProPILOT mode, which is envisioned to provide autonomous driving support tech on urban roads and at intersections. The wraparound rear glass and floating C-pillars also provide an impression of intelligent and efficient aerodynamics. \nFor our part of the world, the autonomous driving bits showcased here may be further in the horizon compared to the sharp design of the Vmotion 2.0. Never mind the second phase, because Nissan’s current look for its ASEAN cars is at odds with the V-motion design already present in the West. The USDM Maxima and the new March supermini are examples of dynamic Nissans that are alien to us in these parts. Time for some harmony perhaps?
