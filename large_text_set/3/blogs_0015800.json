Period. Hang out with two people in love, and you'll most probably come back with a resolve to never be in a relationship space like them because everything they do seems weird. But guess what, that's all relationships. We all do some really freaky and weird shit together, and so does every one else! If you are freaking out about your relationship habits, here are five crazy things all couples are guilty of indulging in. 1. Dividing the bed in two \nYes this happens all the time. While you may not go to the extreme and bring out the marker, but an invisible line is always out there and you can legit lose your shit if the line is crossed. Bed space is a very serious issues, and fighting over encroachment is not a petty argument at all. 2. Netflix wars \nIf your partner is skipping ahead and watching an extra episode, or if he or she is hogging the account and not letting you watch what you want, it is cause for concern. Plus everyone else is doing it too, just so you know. 3. Passive aggressive victories \nHiding your partner's socks, not handing him his towel, refusing to help him pack his bags, and then feeling a sense of happiness, is pretty normal too. Small victories like these is what makes coupling fun, sometimes. 4. Tickle torture \nThere is no explanation for this, but putting your partner through tickle torture is one of the best and most consistent things to irk them, ever. Every couple does it, and it's super satisfying and fun. It mostly involves grabbing hold of a sleeping partners leg (that one leg that is always out of the blanket), and mercilessly ticking it till they wake up... super fun! 5. Not locking the shower \nIt's not because you want your partner to bust in and have wild sex with you, but because you tend to forget. And while you might think that peeing with the door half open is the grossest thing in the universe - which it is by the way - not locking it also means that you have now moved from relationship, to the long term relationship category.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T10:25:47.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
