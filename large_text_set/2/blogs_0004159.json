Man with dogs in his pockets walking his duck, which has shoes on pic.twitter.com/DnMC01JNvX \n— Santero (@djsantero) February 2, 2017 A few days ago, someone posted a photo of a person walking their pet. No big deal, right? There was a cute dog in the picture and everything. But it wasn’t the dog that was going for a walk. The dog was snuggled by its owner in a pocket. \nInstead, it was a duck that was going for a stroll. And from there, i have no idea whats going on. I have so many questions about this photo. For one, the duck is on a leash and its wearing shoes. Was this duck raised thinking it was a dog? Because that plausible considering that it probably lives within close proximity of that pocket dog. \nBut then there’s the question of whether these two pets get along with each other. Is the dog not walking with the duck because they don’t get along and need some separation? How does the owner maintain the peace at home? \nAlso, why does the duck have shoes that fully cover its feet while the owner is wearing sandals? Where does one even buy duck shoes (On the web. I’m sorry)? This has me scratching my head. How does any of this, let alone the absurd combination of these things, happen? \nI’m so perplexed that I’m even questioning whether that sandwich is for the owner, the duck, or the dog. Anyway, I want to be this human. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:35:33.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
