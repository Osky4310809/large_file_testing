Credit Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency An 82-year-old reputed mob figure who was acquitted in connection with the storied 1978 Lufthansa heist in 2015 was indicted again on Wednesday, this time along with John Gotti’s grandson, accused of conduct as petulant and petty as the $6 million robbery of the terminal at Kennedy Airport was grand: setting fire to the car of a motorist who had cut him off on the streets of Queens. And if the indignity of being charged in such a scheme wasn’t bad enough, court papers describe its execution as so clumsy that had the elder John Gotti, a crime figure once known as the Teflon Don, not died in prison after a 1992 conviction he might well die now of shame. To make matters worse, one of two federal indictments unsealed in the case on Wednesday also charged the young mob scion, John J. Gotti, 23, and two other men with a bank robbery that appears on its face to be less than well thought through: The younger Mr. Gotti’s girlfriend, according to the court papers, worked as a teller at the bank branch. The three men, along with the aging, irascible Vincent Asaro, were all charged in United States District Court in Brooklyn with arson and arson conspiracy for setting fire to the car after the road rage episode in April 2012. Prosecutors from the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, who announced the case along with the F.B.I., identified Mr. Asaro as a powerful member of the Bonanno crime family for more than 30 years who they said has served in various leadership positions.

Credit United States Attorney Eastern District of New York A separate federal indictment charges three other men, one of whom prosecutors say is an associate of the Bonanno family, in a home invasion robbery and several jewelry store robberies. Mr. Gotti was sentenced earlier this month to eight years in prison on state drug charges for selling Oxycodone in the Queens neighborhoods of Ozone Park and Howard Beach, from what had been the home of his grandfather, where he lives with his parents and grandmother. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Asaro, who has a lengthy criminal history dating back to 1957, won a stunning courtroom victory in the Lufthansa case in November 2015, when a jury acquitted him of racketeering and other charges. That robbery figured prominently in the plot of the 1990 Martin Scorsese film “Goodfellas.” Elizabeth E. Macedonio, one of the lawyers who represented him in the 2015 trial, cited it when asked about the new charges. \nAdvertisement “He’s faced a series of unfounded charges before and was vindicated, and he will do the same this time,” she said.

A detention memo filed in the case against Mr. Asaro, Mr. Gotti and the two other men said that the older man “became enraged at another motorist who switched lanes in front of Asaro at a traffic light” in Howard Beach. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Asaro chased the other vehicle for a period of time at a high rate of speed,” the detention memo said. Later, Mr. Asaro sought the help of a mob associate in order to get the driver’s address, then directed another to set fire to the motorists car, the memo said.
