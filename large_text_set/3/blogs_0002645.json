Peers are expected to vote for major changes to the Article 50 Bill \nAn amendment by Conservative MP Heidi Allen calls on ministers to find out from local authorities how many children they can help before unilaterally closing the scheme. \nMs Allen believes she could have the support of as many as 31 Tory MPs, enough if combined with Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs to inflict a defeat. \nThe Lords is looking to add two amendments to the Article 50 Bil l as it goes through its report stage today. \nOne will demand ministers give regular updates to Parliament on the progress of the Brexit negotiations and the other will demand Parliament gets a meaningful vote on whatever deal the Prime Minister comes back with. \nAt the moment ministers have promised MPs and peers they will have the chance to approve any “new treaty we agree with the EU” but not if Mrs May carries out her threat to walk away if she cannot achieve a favourable agreement. \nDowning Street argues that giving MPs the chance to send Mrs May back to the negotiating table would play into the hands of the EU negotiators. Stephen Hawking has called for Jeremy Corbyn to quit as leader (Photo: Getty) \n“We should not commit to any process that would incentivise the EU to offer us a bad deal,” No 10 said. \nNo 10 may not wish to read today’s report by the International Trade select committee which says that the ‘no deal’ option should be discounted entirely. \nThe committee says it would mean falling back on World Trade Organisation rules that would saddle businesses with punitive tariffs on imports and exports. \nA better option, it suggests, is for the UK to join the European Free Trade Association along with Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. \nIn the Telegraph today William Hague calls for an early election to give Mrs May the mandate she needs as the Government tries to implement Brexit. \nLabour’s weakness at the moment will also be a factor in Hague’s thinking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T12:03:23.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
