Whitmarsh is Formula 1 should embrace its change of management as fresh ideas will help the sport grow in the future, according to former McLaren boss Martin Whitmarsh. \nBernie Ecclestone relinquished his CEO title after 40 years in charge when Liberty Media completed their $6billion takeover, with the company already laying out long-term plans to improve F1. \nEcclestone's successor Chase Carey, along with Ross Brawn and Sean Bratches, head up the new-look management structure and Whitmarsh believes a different blueprint was necessary for the sport. A collection of Bernie Ecclestone's best sound bites from his Sky Sports F1 interviews in recent years \n\"It's a new era but it's been a long time coming,\" Whitmarsh, who was McLaren CEO until 2013, told Sky Sports News HQ . \n\"There comes a time in any enterprising sport where it's time for fresh ideas and fresh views and I think Formula 1 has probably come to that point. \nFormula 1's new era: An essential Q&A \n\"I'm a Formula 1 fan still and I loved it, I was in it for 25 years but it's nice watching it from afar and I intend to continue to do that. But it's going to grow, live sporting content is so valuable.\" \nWhitmarsh is now the chief of of America's Cup team Land Rover BAR but has fond memories of his time in F1, and reserved praise for the sport's new chairman emeritus Ecclestone. \n\"You've got to give Bernie lots of credit because he was really the driving force in the early days of Formula 1,\" he continued. \n\"He's got that twinkle of charm about him. I was one of his biggest enemies on lots of occasions but you can't help but like the guy. You've got to give him lots of credit for what Formula 1 is today.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T11:46:50.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
