Mennie was taken to the hospital initially after getting hit on the side of the head during a Sydney Sixers training session on Monday (January 23) but was discharged later in the evening. \nThe 28-year-old has been readmitted though as a precautionary measure after scans revealed that he has suffered a serious injury. \"After being struck on the head by a ball at training on Monday, Joe was transported to a hospital in Brisbane where he underwent a series of check-ups before being discharged later that evening,\" Cricket Australia chief medical officer John Orchard said. \n\"Joe was reviewed by a Cricket Australia doctor on Tuesday and had some scans performed that revealed a small fracture and associated minor brain bleed. Whilst this is a serious injury, Joe is feeling well. \n\"We believe that this is a stable injury and will not require surgery. As a precautionary measure, Joe has been admitted to hospital for observation and will continue to be assessed by a neurosurgeon to determine best course of action,\" he further added. \nFormer Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Brad Haddin, who is a part of the Sixers squad, described it as a 'scary incident' while talking to Sky Sports radio. \"It was a bit of a scary incident actually,\" Haddin said. \"He was bowling in the nets and Michael Lumb got hold of one straight back and he's followed through and got him in the head. It was a bit uncomfortable for a couple of minutes.\" \nMennie has featured in two Big Bash League games this season for the Sixers picking up two wickets but has now been ruled out of their semifinal clash against Brisbane Heat on Wednesday (January 25). He has played two One-Day Internationals and one Test so far for Australia. While he played the ODIs in South Africa during the October tour, the Test debut came against the same opposition in Hobart during the summer. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:38:15.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
