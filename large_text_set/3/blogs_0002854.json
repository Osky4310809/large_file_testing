Arguably could have done more to deny Sigurdsson’s equaliser. 2/22 Fernandinho – 6 out of 10 \nMade a number of crucial interceptions and blocks to deflate Swansea moves. 3/22 John Stones – 6 out of 10 \nA textbook performance – solid at the back and held the line well. 4/22 Aleksandar Kolarov – 6 out of 10 \nHis decision making was faultless and he looked confident in possession. 5/22 Gael Clichy – 5 out of 10 \nShould have done more to deny Narsingh in the build-up to Swansea’s equaliser. 6/22 Kevin De Bruyne – 6 out of 10 \nA disciplined display – was a key element to almost every City move. 7/22 Yaya Toure - 6 out of 10 \nHad one tremendous free kick denied by the woodwork. Faultless work rate. 8/22 David Silva – 7 out of 10 \nAssisted Jesus’s goals and continued to begin City moves throughout. Solid performance. 9/22 Raheem Sterling - 6 out of 10 \nCrossed the ball well and ran up and down the flanks relentlessly. Booked unworthily for diving. 10/22 Gabriel Jesus – 10 out of 10 \nTwo goals to win his side the three points and all around terrific display. His movement off the ball is phenomenal, he’s quick and reads the game very well. 11/22 Leroy Sane – 7 out of 10 \nContinued to pump balls into the path of Jesus and made a nuisance of himself throughout. 12/22 Lukasz Fabianski – 6 out of 10 \nMade a handful of important saves but beaten twice by Jesus. 13/22 Kyle Naughton – 5 out of 10 \nWas a victim of City’s speedy strikeforce – looked lost at times. 14/22 Federico Fernandez – 5 out of 10 \nWas beaten by Silva for the first goal. Made a number of unnecessary fouls. 15/22 Alfie Mawson – 7 out of 10 \nSwansea’s best defender, made a number of crucial tackles and clearances to deny City going forward. 16/22 Martin Olsson – 6 out of 10 \nLooked confident on the ball and caused City a problem when he ran at them with the ball. 17/22 Leroy Fer – 6 out of 10 \nBroke a down a number of City attacks and won a majority of the headers. 18/22 Jack Cork – 5 out of 10 \nStruggled to keep up with the pace of City going forward – outclassed at times. 19/22 Tom Carroll – 5 out of 10 \nGave possession away cheaply and against a club of such ability, that’s dangerous. 20/22 Wayne Routledge – 5 out of 10 \nFailed to make a real impact on the game, but showed glimpses of brilliance when in possession. 21/22 Fernando Llorente – 5 out of 10 \nSaw very little of the ball, but that was due to a lack of service. Was also unnecessarily clumsy in challenges. 22/22 Gylfi Sigurdsson – 8 out of 10 \nHunted possession relentlessly, rattled the woodwork with a free kick and scored the equaliser. Top display. \n\"I would like to have English players but they are so expensive,\" he said at his weekly press conference ahead of the midweek clash with Stoke. \n\"They feel something special but sometimes it’s not possible \n\"The market is the market and that’s why the club is working for a long period on the academy.\" \nGuardiola also revealed that Vincent Kompany is back in training after over three months out through injury. \nThe City skipper has been out of action since November with a knee injury but despite nearing a return to fitness the Belgian won't be risked against Stoke on Wednesday evening. \n“No [new injuries],” he added. “[Some] people tired, the rest are okay. \n“Vincent has started training regularly. He made a training session yesterday with the group that didn’t play [at Sunderland] and today he trained.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:53:48.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
