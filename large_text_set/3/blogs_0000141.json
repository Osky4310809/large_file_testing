The original version of the order affected current visa holders as well as people seeking new visas. \nThe Journal described the version that exempted existing visa holders as a \"late draft\" that could change before Trump signs the official order. \nThe White House says the policy seeks to prevent immigration from countries that pose possible terror risks. Some critics like civil rights groups and Democrats have claimed the measure has religious motives due to Trump's previous call for a temporary \"shutdown\" on Muslims entering the country, arguing it could prove counterproductive in fighting terrorism. \nThe Trump administration wants the new order to better stand up to legal scrutiny than the first measure, which Trump signed in late January. The White House has pledged to keep fighting for it in court. \nThe new draft would also not apply to legal permanent residents or green card holders, according to the report. \nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request to comment on this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:39:20.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
