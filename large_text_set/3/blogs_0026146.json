Hughley just solidified why he is a former CNN host: he’s a terrible pundit. Care for an example? Keep reading. \nWhen TMZ cameras caught up to Hughley in the baggage claim of LAX, he rambled on about how racist President Trump is and then actually suggested he work with a magician to make all the black people disappear — an obvious goal of Donald Trump: \n“The thing about this cat, is, you know, he talks to rappers and actors and comedians pretending to give a shit about the problems in the black community. Why doesn’t he just talk to David Copperfield, a magician, so he can make them all go away?” \n“He’s been disrespectful to just about everybody,” Hughley added. “Except the white supremacists who serve him.” \nTMZ also asked about Steve Harvey’s meeting with Trump and how he recently told Snoop Dogg and Bow Wow to be more respectful of the president. Hugely made it quite clear that he doesn’t agree with his fellow comedian: \n“I think if the president were respect worthy, you should do it. But… just this week, he’s accusing a former president of a felony, he’s insulted our allies, he’s lied. A liar doesn’t deserve respect like that. We have two intelligence agencies investigating what he knows is a lie because he thinks he can lie on a black man. F*** your respect. \n“I love Steve… I do not agree. I think… respect is a two way street. I give it to you because I got it.” \nTypical liberal: only giving when he gets. \nClick CONTINUE to watch the footage yourself:  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:15:47.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
