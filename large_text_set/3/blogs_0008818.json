Donald Trump's ambitious plan to build a giant wall on the border with Mexico is stirring up a range of emotions among voters who live there with some saying it would divide the two countries and others who say nothing short of a wall will fix the illegal immigration and drug smuggling problems. Chilton supports the wall and doesn't go anywhere on his ranch without his guns at the ready in case he encounters armed smugglers.
