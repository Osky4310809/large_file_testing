The suit also seeks compensation to employees for lost pay and benefits.\nOracle, one of the world’s largest business software companies, strenuously disputed the allegations.\n“The complaint is politically motivated, based on false allegations, and wholly without merit,” Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger said in a statement.\n“Oracle values diversity and inclusion, and is a responsible equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. Our hiring and pay decisions are non-discriminatory and made based on legitimate business factors including experience and merit,” Hellinger said.\nOracle has 45,000 employees in the U.S., including more than 7,000 in Redwood Shores, according to the department.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:27:57.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
