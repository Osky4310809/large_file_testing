They find themselves in sixth place in the Premier League table, six points behind fourth-placed Liverpool, albeit with two games in hand, after a run of form which has seen them lose four of their last five league games. \nThe pressure has been mounting on Wenger with his side losing six of their last nine games in all competitions and speculation continues to surround the Frenchman's future at the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal's players face the challenge of their lives, according to Neville \nBanners were flown over the Hawthorns by supporters both for and against Wenger, and Neville, speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast , described the current situation at the club as painful to watch. \n\"We love football and respect longevity - we hate the fact managers get sacked after winning the league and doing great jobs,\" Neville said. West Brom 3-1 Arsenal \n\"Then you see what Wenger has done at Arsenal and the situation there at the moment, which I believe goes above and beyond. There is a discord within the fan groups and it's tough to watch. \n\"The players need to stand up,\" he added. \"We've always questioned their character and mentality but they've always delivered of finishing in the top four. These Arsenal players have got the challenge of their lives in the next few weeks. \nWhen asked about the banners flown over the Hawthorns, Neville said: \"I hate the planes that fly the messages across the ground. I hate the banners. Ultimately, fans can say what they want but I don't have to sit here and like it. Arsenal fans protest against Arsene Wenger by flying a plane over the Hawthorns during their match with West Brom. \n\"There is a line. I think all managers and players should be open to criticism. It happened at Manchester United with David Moyes and I didn't like that. You might not what him to be the manager - but really? \n\"It's becoming a bit of a culture that's coming in now. 'What's the most shocking thing we can do to get a manager sacked?' or make a stance against people. There's a point where it goes too far, especially against a man of such distinction like Wenger. Alyson Rudd and Jack Pitt-Brooke believe a good solution to the Wenger situation at Arsenal would be to stay on for another year \n\"He's the most successful Arsenal manager - that shouldn't mean he's above criticism but it should raise him above the low criticism we're seeing for him at the moment. I understand the Arsenal fans' frustrations but it's painful for football people to watch what's going on there.\" Arsenal fans hold up anti-Wenger signs after the match at West Brom \nIn a week where Aitor Karanka lost his job at Middlesbrough , Martin Tyler, who was co-commentating on Man City's draw with Liverpool alongside Neville, asked the former Manchester United defender whether a transfer window for managers should be introduced. \nSwansea, Crystal Palace, Hull and Leicester have all changed their managers and have seen an upturn in fortunes, but Neville would support the idea where team could not sack a manager during the season. Aitor Karanka lost his job at Middlesbrough last week \nNeville said: \"I would support completely the idea that managers can't be sacked during the season. \n\"When you set off at the start of the season with a manager then he has to be your manager for the entire season. Football would support it, in terms of the professional side - I'm not sure whether the owners would. But it would mean the players would know you're going to be the manager until the end of the season, they'd have to get on with it. Marco Silva took charge at Hull in January \n\"Teams are making changes at the bottom of the league and I'm almost sitting there thinking 'I wish this doesn't work' because when it does, it gives others the confidence to change their manager,\" he added. \n\"There have been examples where it's worked when managers are sacked and where it hasn't. I'm not sure there is a distinction between either. It seems to be more the done thing where you do sack the manager at the earliest point as the players respond. \n\"We've seen that at Leicester - what an incredible bounce they've had. It's happened at Swansea and Hull.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:11:28.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
