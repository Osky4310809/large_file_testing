Sen. Chuck Schumer cast in lead role for remake of “Boys Don’t Cry.”\n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) February 5, 2017 \n\nNot only does this play into gross patriarchal ideas about whether men should cry in public, but it makes light of the Holocaust and mocks a film based on the real-life murder of a transgender man, Brandon Teena. Disgusted by Huckabee’s tweet, comedian Cameron Esposito responded by kicking off a series of donations to Trans Lifeline in Brandon Teena’s name. Many others joined her, and as of about an hour ago, Esposito said the campaign has raised $15,000. (Via LGBTQNation )\n. @GovMikeHuckabee : you made an awful joke. We turned it into over $15k for @Translifeline in 24hrs.\nhttps://t.co/ds26GeAfvC pic.twitter.com/i5IWpt6tsz \n— Cameron Esposito (@cameronesposito) February 5, 2017 \n\n \nRaoul Peck’s Oscar-nominated documentary on race in America, I Am Not Your Negro , packed the theaters where it opened this weekend, and Magnolia Pictures intends to “aggressively” expand its distribution. I Am Not Your Negro reeled in a very promising $790,000 from 43 theaters. (For context, wide releases like Split or Hidden Figures are playing in 3,000-3,400 theaters.)

(via io9 ) The Lego Batman Movie has been everywhere, since it hits theaters so soon, but there’s also another Lego movie coming out in September: The Lego Ninjago Movie . USA Today shared some promotional pics from the film, in advance of the trailer that will air when The Lego Batman Movie is released.
