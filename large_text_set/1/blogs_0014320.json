I want my wife back.\" \nMeanwhile, when asked about his last memory before waking up in hospital, Lamar explains: \"Being in that damn brothel and thinking I was going to just rest a little bit. \n\"I wasn't in a good place mentally, especially mentally, before that incident happened.' \n\"Me and my wife at the time were going through some things. I was in a dark place.\" Tears spring to Lamar's eyes as he talks about the night he could have died (Photo: The Doctors) \nThe former NBA star woke up in hospital with then-wife Khloe by his side. \nNow that he's on the road to recovery, Lamar is trying to find some good in the horrible incident. \nHe says: “I guess they say everything happens for a reason. I guess the reason is I’m here. I can tell the story.” Lamar Odom speaks to Dr Travis Stork (Photo: The Doctors) \nThe overdose left Odom in a coma for several days. \nHe tells of his horror at finding out what had happened when he woke up and saw his wife at his bedside. \nHe says: “I didn’t know until Khloe told me that I was in a coma. \n\"I couldn’t even speak at the time. I couldn’t talk. \nNothing would come out of my mouth, so I was scared.” Lamar understandably gets emotional during the interview (Photo: The Doctors) \nKhloe originally filed for divorce from Odom in December 2013, but withdrew the papers to serve as his caretaker while he recuperated. \nThe couple's divorce was finalised in October this year. \nThe interview was conducted before the star checked himself into rehab earlier this week.
