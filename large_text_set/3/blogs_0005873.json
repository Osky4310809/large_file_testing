But when the Cavs needed a big last-minute bucket, Kyrie Irving blew by the Little Ticket and hit this circus shot to tie it: Your Browser does not support iFrames. \nHowever, when the Cavs needed another game-tying shot from Kyrie in the final seconds, Avery Bradley made sure he wasn’t gonna hit it: Your Browser does not support iFrames. \nThe loose-ball rebound ended up in the hands of LeBron James, who got a good look at a go-ahead three but passed it up to give Deron Williams an equally good look, which he missed, and the Celts salted away a 103-99 win — their first in three tries against the Cavs this season. \nAfterward, LeBron passing up the shot was the big story for Cavs critics: LeBron HAS TO take that last shot, off the offensive rebound. Drive it! Get to the free throw line! Don't kick it to poor Derrick Williams. \n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) March 2, 2017 \nBut for the Celtics, Bradley’s defense was the difference maker. Brad Stevens says he purposely saved Avery Bradley's final minutes of playing time until the end of the 4Q, and that was a critical decision \n— Boston Celtics (@celtics) March 2, 2017 How important was it to have Avery Bradley available to defend Kyrie Irving? Brad Stevens says, \"I think it’s a necessity.\" \n— Boston Celtics (@celtics) March 2, 2017 Avery Bradley on his D: \"It's something I take pride in. I love going up against the Kyries, the Russell Westbrooks, all of those guys.\" \n— Brian Robb (@CelticsHub) March 2, 2017 A couple of summers ago Kyrie Irving told kids at his basketball camp that Avery Bradley guards him better than anyone else in the NBA \n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) March 2, 2017 \nCheck out all the clutch plays in this game, which we hope is a playoff preview: All the clutch plays from a thriller in Boston! pic.twitter.com/OHFJ1fgsNV", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:07:37.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
