Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) today introduced a resolution objecting to the UNSC action \"and to all efforts that undermine direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians for a secure and peaceful settlement.\"\nIt calls the veto \"inconsistent with long-standing United States policy and makes direct negotiations more, not less, challenging,\" and calls for the resolution \"to be repealed or fundamentally altered so that it is no longer one-sided and allows all final status issues toward a two-state solution to be resolved through direct bilateral negotiations between the parties.\"\nIt also \"demands that the United States ensure that no action is taken at the Paris Conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict scheduled for January 15, 2017, that imposes an agreement or parameters on the parties.\"\nCo-sponsors are Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), and Todd Young (R-Ind.).\n“Since the days of ‘Zionism is racism,’ the U.N. has been a fervently anti-Israel body and, unfortunately, that bias has never diminished. Knowing this, past administrations – both Democrat and Republican – have protected Israel from the vagaries of this biased institution,” Schumer said. “Unfortunately, by abstaining on United Nations Resolutions 2334, this administration has not followed in that path.\"\nA House vote is scheduled for Thursday on a similar resolution introduced by Rep. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.).\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) said in a joint statement announcing the vote that the lower chamber \"will not abstain from its responsibility and will vote on a bipartisan resolution reaffirming our longstanding policy in the region and support of Israel.\"\nAnd House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a statement today that he's on board -- particularly in the hope that \"strong, bipartisan support for this House resolution will send a message to deter any last-ditch efforts that might further undermine Israel’s position, particularly with regard to the conference to be held in Paris later this month.\"\nHoyer noted that before the Dec. 23 abstention at the UNSC by the United States, he had \"urged\" President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to use the country's veto power, but instead the administration \"sent the wrong signal to our ally Israel, to Israel's enemies, and to the world.\"\nhttps://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2017/01/04/first-resolutions-of-new-congress-backing-israel-get-strong-bipartisan-support/\nload more View as single page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:50:38.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
