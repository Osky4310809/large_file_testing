The GOP has majorities in both the House and Senate.\n“Perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today because we’ll end up with a truly great health care bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes,” Trump said Friday afternoon, speaking from the Oval Office.\n\nHe predicted that Democrats would look to work with Republicans on health care reform in the future, even as Democratic lawmakers celebrated the failure of the Republican plan.\n“Whenever they’re ready, we’re ready,” Trump said, repeatedly arguing that “w ith no Democrat support, we couldn’t quite get there.” \nThe bill also faced opposition from many Republicans and health organizations.\nIn an earlier press conference on Friday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan explained that the GOP-controlled House was unable to reach consensus on the controversial bill. “ This is a setback — no two ways about it — but it is not the end of this story,” Ryan said. \nTrump said he still had confidence in Ryan and refrained from casting blame on Republicans who had withheld their support.\n“A lot of people don’t realize don’t how good our bill was,” Trump said, arguing that when taken as a three-phase plan, “it became a great bill.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:41:13.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
