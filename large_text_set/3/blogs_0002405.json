Gordon and Carter Page met with and spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a conference that was connected to the Republican National Committee. It was previously noted that this was one of the times Sessions met with Kislyak. \nIt’s unknown what the Trump campaign officials who spoke with the ambassador – J.D. Gordon and Carter Page – discussed with him. Those who took part in the events in Cleveland said it is not unusual for presidential campaign teams to interact with diplomats. \nHowever, the newly-revealed communications further contradict months of repeated denials by Trump officials that his campaign had contact with officials representing the Russian government. \nGordon, who was the Trump campaign’s director of national security, told USA Today that it wasn’t unusual for campaigns to speak with diplomats and described the conversation as “informal.” \nMeanwhile, Page said “confidentiality rules” prevented him from discussing his conversations with Kisylak, though he did say it was not “substantive.” Page left the campaign over the summer and he has been the subject of previous reports regarding campaign communications with Russia. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:35:13.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
