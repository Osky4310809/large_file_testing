The director, testifying before a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, also said that the agency was probing whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The US intelligence community has suggested that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee during the election to embarrass Trump's presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\"I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counter-intelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russiaâ€™s efforts. As with any counter-intelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed,\" Comey said.\nMoments later, in response to a question about Trump's claims on Twitter earlier this month that he was wiretapped by Obama during the election, Comey responded: \"The department has no information that supports those tweets.\"\nOn March 4, in a surprise tweet , Trump claimed: \"How low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\" The president later followed up with other tweets saying the same thing.\nComey and Mike Rogers, the National Security Agency director, both testified that there was no evidence that Russian hacking intruded into US voting machines to change the outcome of the presidential election\nAdam Schiff, an Intelligence Committee member and Democrat from California, said that \"if the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it aided or abetted the Russians, it would not only be a serious crime, it would also represent one of the most shocking betrayals of democracy in history.\" He said that the hack into the Democratic National Committee was used \"to help Donald Trump and harm Hillary Clinton.\"\n( This story is developing and will be updated .)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:25:10.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
