You can choose to buy the new flagship from either one of those carriers or wait until May for the unlocked units to arrive. \nIf you have no issues with buying a carrier-locked handset then perhaps you should go the Best Buy route. If you pre-order Galaxy S8 from Best Buy you stand to save quite a bit of money. It’s offering customers up to $100 off the Galaxy S8+ and $50 off the Galaxy S8 when they pre-order the handset via BestBuy.com or their local retail store. \nPre-order customers will receive a free Gear VR with Controller headset and the Oculus content bundle over and above this discount which can also be clubbed with select details available for Verizon, AT&T and Sprint customers. \nBest Buy starts taking pre-orders for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ tomorrow. It will be released on April 21 . Customers can put money down for the new flagship at Best Buy stores, including the Samsung Experience Shops inside Best Buy outlets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:49:47.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
