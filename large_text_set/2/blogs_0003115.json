Because Insta stories disappear after 24 hours, the Twitter page Selena Gomez News captured the snippets, posting both bits of the song. \nThe unconfirmed title track’s first tease features a half profile of Gomez with a black X over her mouth, with the lyrics, “I had a dream / we were back to 17 / summer nights and liberties / never growing up,” while part two shows off a very Kygo-esque beat. \n— Selena Gomez News (@SelenaHQ) February 3, 2017 \nWhile it appears the singer is making new music, she is also busy as executive producer of the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why , an adaptation of the best-selling young adult novel, which hits the streaming service March 31.
