Jones , USA TODAY Published 10:10 a.m. ET Jan. 31, 2017 | Updated 2 hours ago Kal Penn arrives at CBS's 1st National TV Dinner Night at the CBS Radford Studios in Los Angeles. (Photo: Matt Sayles, Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) \nDesignated Survivor star Kal Penn translated an act of hate into love — and more than three-quarters of a million dollars. \nSpurred by a bigoted social media user who told him \"you don’t belong in this country,\" the actor, who was born in Montclair, N.J., to immigrant parents, launched a crowdfunding campaign Saturday in support of Syrian refugees, who are indefinitely barred from entry into the U.S. under President Trump’s executive order on immigration . \nThe page raised $30,000 on its start date and had amassed more than $760,000 at press time. Donations will go to International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian aid organization dedicated to providing financial support and primary, reproductive and trauma care to families in Syria. \nPenn dedicated the online fundraiser to the unnamed user, noting on his Crowdrise page that he hopes the campaign proves \"we are better than the hateful people who tell us we don't belong in our own country, that America can't be a beacon of freedom and hope for refugees from around the world.\" A definitive list of celebrity stances on Trump's controversial immigration order \nThe actor also went on CNN Monday to discuss his efforts, which far exceeded his initial expectations. \"I'm a pretty privileged guy. What about the 14-year-old me or the kids who look like me who don't have the luxury of this platform?\" he said. \"Maybe we can raise $25,000 and show guys like that that we're better than this.\" \n\"All I did was set up a page,\" he maintained. \"It just speaks to the tens of thousands of people who felt the same way I did who said, 'Let's help some refugees out.'\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jQlaSi NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
