I’ve assumed that it was some variation of “LOOK OVER HERE!” and “YOU LOOK GREAT/UGLY/PERFECT,” but apparently, if you’re Chrissy Teigen, it’s occasionally racist, vile, trash directed at your husband, John Legend.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nAs she is wont to do , Teigen was merrily tweeting her way through her flight to New York, commenting on plane food and her very wise decision to avoid the shrimp toast first thing in the morning when she also tweeted some shit a pap decided to say to her about her husband: “If we evolved from monkeys, why is John Legend still around?”\n\nHer husband was standing next to her. Cool. This inquiry came in the middle of what I assume were some inane questions about Cravings , probably asked at first to partially to exploit the fact that she really does seem like one of the nicest and more genuine celebrities around. \n\nBecause casually insulting the husband of the person you’re trying to make money off of wasn’t enough, the pap also felt it necessary to tackle this anti-Semitic question for the ages:\n\nThat is...quite the transition and also remarkably inappropriate. Nice try, unnamed racist paparazzo, but what made you think Chrissy Teigen would fall for your shit?\nAdvertisement \n\nAdvertisement \n\n[ Cosmopolitan ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T03:57:02.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
