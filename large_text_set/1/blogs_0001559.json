Feelers from Sunday Scoop ’s snooping around indicate that estranged lovebirds, singer, Tiwa Savage, and her former manager cum husband, Tunji Balogun aka Teebillz are back in each other’s arms. It will be recalled that the once lovey-dovey couple washed their dirty linen in public sometime in April 2016, when the couple fell out big time. Teebillz, who claimed to be the brains behind Tiwa’s music fortunes, accused the singer of cheating on him with several artistes including Don Jazzy, 2face and Dr. Sid. He also blamed Tiwa’s mum for fuelling the crisis in their marriage. Of course, Tiwa did not just debunk the allegations, she also accused of Teebillz of being a habitual user of drugs , stealing her money and engaging in extra-marital affairs. However, a lot of water has passed under the bridge since then, and it seems the couple has finally put the squabble behind them. According to a source close to the couple, family members from both sides have intervened in the dispute and have successfully brought about reconciliation. The hitherto estranged lovebirds have now buried the hatchet but not before Teebillz travelled out of the country where he underwent rehabilitation to help with his drug addiction. He returned to the country recently, and has been spending time with his son, Jamal. Also, he and Tiwa are back to living together. At media personality, Stephanie Coker and Olumide Aderinokun’s wedding, Tiwa and Teebillz were the centre of attention.Their first public appearance together since their well-publicised break-up, the duo only had eyes for each other. A besotted Teebillz could not keep his hands away from his wife’s waist. Our source also disclosed that the couple had been advised to keep their relationship off social media, and from the prying eyes of third parties. It was also learnt that while the couple was apart, Tiwa, reportedly purchased a house in Jos, Plateau State, where she went to cool off, at the peak of her marriage crisis. She fell in love with the cold and cosy environment in Jos and shelled out several millions of naira to purchase a house in a highbrow area of the Tin City. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Fatai Ibrahim gh \nCrazy! I was curious to read how many this robber killed while reading. Only to be disappointed that he killed no one, at least according to this article. This is in no way a support for robbery but one could see the connection between the judgement and the fact that his robbery was taken to the judges quarters. What about hundreds that have been killef because someone entrusted with a public office is only concerned about looting and purchase of bullet proof cars? It is high time we looked seriously into the Nigerian Law of steal a goat get 2yrs, kill hundreds and pay a fine at worst. Omotolaaraujo \nArmed robbery is a death sentence. That seems extreme when no one was injured in the robbery. Dejandon \nIts death sentence once arms are involved, whether used or unused. The judge simply upheld the dictates of the law in this instance. Fire \nIt’s because he robbed a high profile person, stupid country. The people stealing our money with pen are still roaming about freely. This country makes me sick! larry \nit so stupid for Nigeria judges to deliver harsh judgement on citizens, this sound so nasty that even a blind man can not do it. why can’t those who steals billions of naria every blessed day face hanging by death rather poor man face harsh justice El realista \nIt is stupid to think that the Judiciary makes these Laws when their duty is jsut to interprete the Laws. Armed robbery is quite different from ursurping public funds, and carries a separate sentence. You should speak to your lawmakers to prescribe stiffer penalties for corruption. Jojo \nIt is very sad that our country’s judicial system has become a travesty. U can imagine that the court will take such a decision, but they will never make laws applicable to the political thieves that steal the wealth of its nation’s present and future generations. Let them take examples from China that gives life imprisonment to the likes of Bo Xilai, and even nearby Ghana that terminates appoinments of its ministers for mere statement that just portray proclivities, before they come to the ordinary citizen. Jojo \nI wish to expressly state that the judge, by virtue of his sentence, is guilty and should be charged for incompetence (inability to administer fair judgement) and attempted murder of our fellow citizen by misinterpretation of the law and ill-judgement. How would you pass a death sentence on someone who never killed anyone? I am forced to question the sanity of the judge here. Are we beginning to have blood-thirsty judges now? SHOULD THAT BOY BE HANGED O JUSTICE ONUM ADAM, MAY GOD ASK BACK FOR THE BLOOD OF THAT BOY WHO NEVER KILLED ANYONE FROM YOU AND FROM YOUR GENERATIONS TO COME. YOU SHALL KNOW NO PEACE. Go and judge the corrupt leaders who are the root cause of this man going to rob to make a living before you come to judge he himself. Tayo \nYou have showed a lack of basic legal understanding. The law of Nigeria says once you are convicted of armed robbery you should face the death penalty, the Judge does not have a choice but to uphold the law once the case has been established. why are you cursing the messenger ? if you have issues take it up with the Nigerian law, ask your rep for review, not heap blames on an innocent judge. Jojo \ntell me: where is that same law in the case of Oduah? Where is that same law ind case of politicians who loot and launder? let d curse go out to those who make d law to shield their crimes Latest Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T03:07:37.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
