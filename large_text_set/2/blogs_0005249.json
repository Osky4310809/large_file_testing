Scottie Thompson sparks Ginebra in the third quarter and they force a rubber match for a semis slot against Alaska. Photo from PBA Images \nMANILA, Philippines – It's not over yet. \nBarangay Ginebra San Miguel bucked early offensive struggles, coming alive in the third quarter to come back from 17 points down and defeat the twice-to-beat Alaska Aces, 85-81, in the 2017 PBA Philippine Cup on Sunday, February 5 at the Ynares Center in Antipolo. \nNeeding two wins to reach the semifinals, the Gin Kings forced the do-or-die quarterfinals contest against the second seed Aces after a spirited 29-4 run to overturn the deficit and finish the third quarter up by 8. \nThe physical contest saw Alaska coming to within a point with under 5 minutes remaining as veteran marksmen from both sides buried one big shot after another. \nBut 23-year-old Scottie Thompson, who sparked that third quarter rally, connected on a trey for the 4-point cushion, 80-76, as Ginebra held on for another \"Never Say Die\" kind of victory. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
