Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical reported the situation is \"complicated\" because of Ewing's close relationship with John Thompson, the father of former Georgetown coach John Thompson III . The elder Thompson was Ewing's coach when he played at Georgetown in the 1980s. Ewing, 54, has been an NBA assistant since 2002 but has never received a head coaching job. Resistant to college jobs in the past, Ewing could be tempted by the allure of bringing his alma mater back to prominence. Thompson III was fired Thursday after a 13-year run as head coach. The Hoyas went 14-18 this past season, their second straight losing campaign. They had not been under .500 in consecutive years since 1972-73 and 1973-74, the elder Thompson's first two seasons at the university. Wojnarowski reported Ewing was \"emotional\" regarding Thompson III's firing. While respect ran high for the younger Thompson within Georgetown circles, it was Big John's presence that really has caused some hesitation. \"Everyone knows a change needs to be made,\" one former player told ESPN's Jeff Goodman . \"But no one will dare stand up and say it.\" Goodman highlighted Thompson's presence as something that could \"scare\" potential coaches away from taking the vacancy. He has remained close to the program in the nearly two decades since leaving the school and only expanded his relationship with the university during his son's tenure.
