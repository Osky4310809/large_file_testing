Also joining them for the ride this time is TDE all-star Kendrick Lamar. \nThe combo of Slim Jxmmi, Swae Lee, Gucci Mane and Mike WiLL Made-It made “Black Beatles” one of 2016’s biggest hits (along with some help from the #MannequinChallenge ), and adding Kendrick into the mix can only help to draw more ears to the new song. \n“Can we drop one more new Rae Sremmurd song?” Slim Jxmmi asked the Lucerna Velky Sal crowd in Prague, Czech Republic at the February 2 concert, to a cheer of approval from fans. “This song is Rae, Gucci Mane and Kendrick Lamar.” \nListen to the clip above, but be warned that the DJ cuts the record before K. Dot’s verse. Sorry. \nBased on a tweet from January 28, the track comes from Mike WiLL Made-It’s long-awaited Ransom 2 project. Ever wonder what A Gucci x Rae Sremmurd x Kendrick Lamar track would sound like make sure you get that Ransom 2 \nRansom 2 was originally scheduled to come out in January of 2016 but was delayed partly because the producer wanted Gucci Mane (who was behind bars at the time) to host the project. \n“Coming very very very soon,” the “First Day Out Tha Feds” beatmaker tweeted nearly a year ago. \nWith Gucci a free man now, it might only be a matter of time before more news of the album starts bubbling up again. \nThe SremmLife team has a handful of remaining dates on their European tour, which ends February 10 in Oslo, Norway.
