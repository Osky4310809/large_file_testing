Brook returned to welterweight to defend IBF belt after loss to Gennady Golovkin \n\"It's not something I just go for,\" Spence Jr told Behind The Gloves . \"We just wait on it and if it happens, or he shows me something that he's hurt, I'm going to jump on him and stop him.\" \nThe 27-year-old believes Brook will be \"favoured\" as the hometown fighter, but is still confident he can capture the Sheffield man's IBF belt with a convincing victory. The American is not concerned about travelling to Britain for Brook fight \n\"He's definitely going to be favoured, because it's in the UK, but I don't feel the need to have to go there and stop him,\" said Spence Jr. \n\"I'm not going to put that pressure on myself. That's when it don't happen, or you look sloppy, and end up losing some other way. . @SpecialKBrook looking đŞđ˝ already!
