So, why not take a tip from British body-positive model Megan Jayne Crabbe and do a “bopo wardrobe blitz” (AKA body-positive wardrobe blitz). In a post on her @bodyposipanda Instagram account, the always inspirational Crabbe noted how you don’t need clothes that change the shape of your body — especially your tummy — since you may be more happy when your body is free.\nLike many of us, Crabbe used to squeeze into shapewear before she would wear a dress. Yet, she is now working on accepting her body after suffering from anorexia, and this body positive icon made the excellent point that she shouldn’t have had to torture herself to dress up. She wrote:\n“I wish I could have realised that it was okay to just wear the damn dress and let my stomach be free!” So yesterday I did a bopo wardrobe blitz. I got rid of everything that no longer fits because of this beautiful bit of extra chub I'm rocking lately. I didn't vow to diet myself back into the clothes like I used to. My peace of mind is way more important than any piece of fabric! During the clear out I found these - my old Spanx. I used to squeeze myself into them every single time I wore a dress, because I bought into the idea that if my stomach wasn't flat, I wasn't worthy of being seen. I'd go hungry all day, sweat my life away, and take a million trips to the bathroom just to roll them back up. I wish I could have realised that it was okay to just wear the damn dress and let my stomach be free! I didn't need to look as toned as possible to deserve going out. I didn't need to live in fear of being caught at the wrong angle and someone seeing that *GASP* MOST TUMMIES ARE NOT COMPLETELY FLAT. And I seriously could have saved myself from so much dehydration. So the Spanx were the final thing on the clear out pile. And if you're still holding onto items of clothing that only serve to make you uncomfortable and look smaller than you are, take this as your permission to get rid of them. Sure, if they bring you joy, keep them, but if they don't, let them go. And let those glorious tummies be free!

I didn’t need to live in fear of being caught at the wrong angle and someone seeing that *GASP* MOST TUMMIES ARE NOT COMPLETELY FLAT. And I seriously could have saved myself from so much dehydration.” Just a little reminder that YOU are the only person with the power to decide how you feel about your body. UR CUTE IF YOU DECIDE UR CUTE!

But if it’s causing you more anguish than anything else, Crabbe has provided a powerful reminder that it’s a not requirement since you should love your stomach the way it is — and in the words of Crabbe, “Let those glorious tummies be free!”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:54:09.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
