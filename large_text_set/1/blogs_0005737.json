But what he wants to do is grow the economy, help shore up Medicare and Social Security for future generations.” \nMr. Trump said frequently during the 2016 campaign that he didn’t plan to touch entitlement spending , including Medicare and Social Security. However, congressional Republicans -- including House Speaker Paul Ryan -- have long favored restructuring both programs. \nAnd as Republicans strategize about how best to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act ( better known as Obamacare ), Priebus said it would be “ideal” to repeal the law and implement an alternative all at once -- but indicated that might not be possible. \n“It would be ideal if we could do it all in one big action,” he said. “But look, it may take time to get all the elements of the ‘replace’ in place.” \nHe said some aspects of the repeal can be done through reconciliation, which requires just 50 votes in the Senate -- but that others will need a 60-vote majority to be implemented, which could be tougher to do as an “instantaneous action.” \n“I mean, if you can get 60 votes within a few weeks and get all those elements of [Sen.] Rand Paul’s votes into place that would be great,” he said. “But I think we all understand that things sometimes do take some time and the full repeal and replace may take a little bit more time.” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
