Science Says Girls as Young as 5 Think Men Are Smarter Than Women Sarah Cottrell Image Source: Thinkstock \nWhen I was in 4th grade, our teacher taught us how to debate by breaking up the 20 or so kids into a few small groups and giving us each controversial issues to argue. I was teamed up with a group of boys and no other girls. Our teacher asked us to come up with a list of reasons why women should not be allowed to play in the NBA — a hot-button issue at the time, and one that we would debate with another group of students in class. \nI still remembering citing long nails, periods, and distracting hair styles as reasons for why women couldn’t possibly be able to play basketball professionally. \nAny guess where I heard those ones? Hmmm? \nAny girl can count on her hand the many ways in which she is perceived as inferior to boys. For us females, it’s really no big mystery, as young girls are sent gender-biased messages left and right from the media, their own toys, and even adults. \nBut research studies — which, as a reminder, are still mostly conducted by men — are trying to decode the gender gap in STEM fields. And to do that, they are looking specifically at how girls perceive their intellectual abilities as compared to boys. \nThe hope is that by understanding why girls tend to defer to boys in areas of science, technology, engineering, and math, we will be able to find new and innovative ways to draw more girls into STEM fields.

In an experiment that looked at how gender affects the perception of intellectual brilliance, study authors say that kids were “told a brief story about a person who was ‘really, really smart.'” They weren’t given any hints that would identify that protagonist’s gender, and once the story was over, they were shown four adults (two men, and two women), and asked to guess which of the might be the protagonist. \nThe results spoke volumes about how girls see themselves by the tender age of 5, 6, and 7. Girls were overwhelmingly more likely to assume that the “really really smart” person was a dude. \nHonestly? I’m not shocked by this report’s findings, and chances are, neither are you. The sciences have been traditionally male, with women still breaking glass ceilings in STEM fields left and right. Any quick peek into history — even as recently as 1983, when Sally Ride became the first American woman in space — would show that women are still making firsts among the tracks of men. \nSo where do we go from here? Undoing the stereotypes ingrained in us over generations ain’t easy. But girls need to be taught to assert their ideas and voices as strongly as boys are taught; and we need to start this early.

It signaled to young females everywhere that we are entering a new era in which girls will finally be permitted to demonstrate their tenacity, brilliance, and grit. Science is finally asking the important questions about gender inequality in STEM fields, because, GIRLS! \nWe may have come a ways from debating the merits of having an all-female NBA (thank God), but we are still living in a world in which girls cannot see themselves in power positions. They cannot see themselves as scientists, politicians, or even CEOs — at least not as easily as boys. But imagine, if you can, a world where none of our girls second-guess their potential, or give up on something they’re interested in, simply because they don’t believe they’re smart enough. \nThat is the future that I want to see for my kids, and I’m just so glad the science is finally there to help us better understand the gender gap — as well as how we can close it for good.
