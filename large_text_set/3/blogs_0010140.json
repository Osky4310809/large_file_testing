The first time the man who made for compelling theater with his thick forearms, whirlybird follow-through and go-for-broke bravado that earned him 62 PGA Tour titles including seven majors, won’t be here. \nThe first time the man who connected with the masses, from children to captains of industry to Presidents, won’t be here. The first time the gentle soul who spent countless hours signing autographs, posing for pictures and raising money for charity won’t be here. \n“Arnold was a force of nature, on and off the course,” 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell said. “ ... Obviously, we got to know him as a golfer, but the person was even more special. You only had to spend a few minutes in his company to understand why he touched so many people the way he did. From his signature on every autograph that he ever signed, to just the way he touched people and the way he gave back, he really was just one of the most rounded athletes that we can think of. His personality was bigger than his golf in so many ways, and he was as great a role model as we can think of in the game of golf.” \nMORE GOLF: Tiger Woods says there's no timetable for return to PGA Tour \nThe void this week will be filled not with mourning for Palmer, who passed away in September at 87, but with celebration, honor and a few thousand stories all triggering good thoughts. While everyone will miss seeing Palmer crisscrossing fairways in his golf cart to catch up with a friend, or standing off to the side of the 18th green on Sunday waiting to say thank you, all will gaze over the fairways thinking of the man that made them feel so good. \nMcDowell will be joined by former PGA Tour stars Curtis Strange and Peter Jacobsen, LPGA icon Annika Sorenstam and former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge as co-hosts this week. The five will help with a variety of roles traditionally held by Palmer, including hosting pro-am parties and the trophy presentation. \n“I did a lot of things with Arnold, had a chance to compete with him a lot in best-ball events and exhibition events, and it is going to be a sad week,” Jacobsen said. “But it’s also going to be a fun week. I know that being involved in the tournament, if Arnold were still here, Arnold would want everyone to have a good time. He would want everyone to be enjoying the game of golf, the love of the game, and I think he’d also like us to remember the lessons that he passed along to us.” \nWhile some of the game’s best aren’t playing this week, including world No. 1 Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Adam Scott, Phil Mickelson and Justin Thomas, four of the top 10 in the world are here — defending champion Jason Day, four-time major winner Rory McIlroy, reigning British Open champion Henrik Stenson and Hideki Matsuyama. No. 9 Rickie Fowler, No. 13 Justin Rose, reigning Masters champion Danny Willett, two-time Masters winner Bubba Watson, two-time major champion Martin Kaymer and World Golf Hall of Fame members Ernie Els and Vijay Singh are in the field. As is John Daly. \nStenson is making his ninth start in the event. It’s always been special for Stenson; two of his three children were born at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies in Orlando. And he’s played well here, with five top-15 finishes in his last five starts. He finished second in 2015 and after the tough loss, he received consolation from Palmer as the two walked off the green. \n“I would have liked to have seen that memory being a little bit different than getting a pat on my shoulder,” Stenson said. “ ... Seeing him briefly every year here at the tournament was special. When I won the Open (last year at Royal Troon) and I had a close look at the Claret jug, I saw obviously that he won at Troon in 1962. And I would have liked to have tried to meet up for lunch here and share some memories from the wins. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. ... \n“It’s a very different week with Arnold not being here with us. He’s meant so much to the game of golf, of course, to this being his own tournament on his own golf course. So he will be dearly missed and we will do our best to make it a very successful week without him and pay tribute to him, to his career and everything that he’s done for the game.” \nLouis Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open winner, circled this week on his calendar when he made his schedule. He finished tied for ninth in 2015 and tied for 64th in 2009 in his only other appearances. \n“I think it will be a great way to say thank you to Mr. Palmer for what he has done for golf,” Oosthuizen said. “I just think it’s a tournament that if you can you should play.” \nOosthuizen said when he was growing up, he watched loads of video clips of Palmer. When Oosthuizen won the Open at St. Andrews, he received a letter from Palmer. And he’ll never forget the first time he met Palmer. \n“It was in 2009 and I was playing with Charl Schwartzel at Bay Hill and Mr. Palmer was on the buggy out there and he came up to the two of us on the 18th hole,” Oosthuizen said. “Charl was taking a few practice swings and looked up and Mr. Palmer said, ‘Hit it close, young man,’ and all of a sudden Charl had a little bit more pressure on him. You remember those moments. ... \n“You don’t forget a man like Mr. Palmer.\" \nPHOTOS: 2016-17 TOURNAMENT WINNERS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:25:29.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
