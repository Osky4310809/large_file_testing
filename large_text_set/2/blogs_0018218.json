Even though Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is done and over with , and I no longer need to comb the internet for Gilmore Girls hints and clues anymore , I still do. It’s a habit, I guess. And besides, there are worse things I could Google every single day of my life, you know?\nAnyway. I’m telling you this because once again, I found myself Googling Gilmore Girls earlier today, and that’s when I noticed that the ~official~ Gilmore Girls Facebook page had updated their main image. A year ago, this kind of change would send me and literally everyone else on the internet into a TAILSPIN because A . But a year later, four months after A Year in the Life hit Netflix, this subtle change probably doesn’t mean anything.\nOR DOES IT?\nOkay, let’s take a little trip down Gilmore Girls main image history lane. The page was created back 2011, and from 2012-2016 this is the image proudly displayed:\n& Posted by Gilmore Girls on  Wednesday, December 5, 2012 With the upcoming release of A Year in the Life, Gilmore Girls changed their picture to just this cute coffee cup (from the ~official~ Year in the Life promotional posters).\n& Posted by Gilmore Girls on  Tuesday, June 21, 2016 But then today, after almost 9 months of this coffee cup, Gilmore Girls reverted back to an early image of Lorelai and Rory — and one that appears to be a picture from “The Lorelais’ First Day At Chilton.” & Posted by Gilmore Girls on  Thursday, February 23, 2017 Well. Now seems like kinda an odd time to just up and change your profile picture, Gilmore Girls . I checked all of GG’s other social accounts (you’re welcome) and nothing there has changed. Their Twitter is still as-is, as is their Instagram, and there’s nothing new on the TownofStarsHollow.com . Or the Netflix press site. I checked it ALL.\nDoes this subtle profile picture change mean anything? From the bottom of my heart, I wish I could say yes. But…probably not, and that’s a bummer. Also, hope for A Year in the Life Season 2 diminished a little bit today, since Lauren Graham just signed onto a brand new network sitcom and this means she’s a lot busier than she was before. Hate to say it, but we’re probably not going to get more Year in the Life this year…or maybe even next year.\nHowever, it sure is fun to live life looking for every little Gilmore Girls thing out there, and I will continue to do this until the end of time because it keeps me busy! And sometimes it gets Netflix’s attention ☺️!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:51:34.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
