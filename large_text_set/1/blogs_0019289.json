And no, it’s not sightseeing in Europe or soaking up sun on an island — it’s visiting a cookie dough café in New York City . The new store from DŌ , Cookie Dough Confections, is opening up on Wednesday, January 25th at 1 p.m. ET in Greenwich Village and you should probably already be salivating at the mere idea of this magical eatery.\nWhile the company DŌ isn’t new , its storefront will be a gift to dessert lovers everywhere. DŌ was created by Kristen Tomlan and focuses exclusively on cookie dough products that can be safely consumed raw. Although you could order these delicious-looking desserts online already, seeing them in person might actually make you swoon.\nFriday feels thanks to @grubstreet and @melissa_hom. The new shop is opening next week! Who else could use one of these today?? #cookiedough #cookies #baking #nutella #opening #newshop #yummy #foodie #nyc #greenwichvillage #desserts #sweettooth #yum #stuffed #foodstagram #love #cookie \nA photo posted by DŌ, Cookie Dough Confections™ (@cookiedonyc) on Jan 20, 2017 at 8:24am PST \nLike many of us, Tomlan is a sucker for cookie dough, so she came up with the idea of using a pasteurized egg product and heat-treated, ready-to-eat flour in her cookie dough so there is no risk of food-borne illnesses like salmonella. That means you can eat all the raw cookie dough you want!\nWhile that doesn’t necessarily make her yummy products completely guilt-free, it definitely adds to their allure. Just look at these cookie dough tubs!
