REUTERS \nSimilar to humans, going on dates and matching with a complete dud is a waste of time. Scientists hope that this breeding program will lead to a higher success rate when it comes to matching up cute, little orangutans. \n“Often animals have to be taken back to the zoo they came from without mating,” said the Dutch zoo’s behavioral biologist Thomas Bionda. “Things don’t always go well when a male and female first meet.” Tinder Headshots: Photographer Offering To Help Users Get Laid To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSo far, the experiment has been going fairly well, with a few bumps here and there. \nA previous test involving chimpanzees and bonobos proved the animals were extremely responsive when presented with photos of their own species mating or grooming others. \nBut, as orangutans are less superficial than us human folk, they sometimes need more than a pretty picture to find the perfect partner. \n“Usually, smell plays an important role too,” Bionda said of orangutan’s matchmaking criteria. “But with the orangutans, it will be what you see is what you get.” Giphy \nCurrently, scientists are trying to design a strong enough screen that will keep the orangutans from damaging the touchscreen. \nEven with a steel support frame, the tablet didn’t survive long in the hands of Samboja, according to The Guardian . Clearly, any orangutan whose mother has the nickname “Demolition Woman” should be monitored at all times. \nIt’ll be pretty interesting to see how this plays out over the next few years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:51:28.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
