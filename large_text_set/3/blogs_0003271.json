Photo: Mike Mozart/ Flickr \nThe days of placing your order with a person at McDonald’s is about to come to an end. McDonalds revealed today at its investor meeting that it is finally ready to embrace the digital age by adding support for mobile ordering and delivery at nearly all of its locations across the U.S.\nMore than 14,000 US stores will have mobile order and pay by the end of autumn 2017, according to McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook. \n“Through enhanced technology to elevate and modernize the customer experience, a focus on the quality and value of our food and redefined convenience through delivery, we have a bold vision for the future and the urgency to act on it,” said Easterbrook during McDonald’s annual investors day. \nMcDonald’s has experienced four straight years of traffic declines. About 500 million transactions have been lost since 2012 as patrons have decided to opt for other fast food chains that provide a more modern experience. To win back customers, McDonald’s plans to speed up the order process. By ordering through the McDonald’s mobile app, customers will be able to pick up orders at drive-thru windows, or designated curbside delivery spots. You can also pick orders up inside the restaurant. \nAlong with the new app experience, McDonald’s plans to create 2,500 “Experience of the Future” restaurants. The revamped shops will offer self-service kiosks, table service and reconfigured kitchens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:48:58.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
