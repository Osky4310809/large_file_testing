When is Onam in 2017, 2018, and 2019? \nOnam is celebrated in the beginning of the month of Chingam, the first month of the solar Malayalam calendar (Kollavarsham). It falls in August or September each year. There are four main days of Onam. The most important day of Onam (known as Thiru Onam or Thiruvonam, meaning \"Sacred Onam Day\") is the second day. In 2017, Thiru Onam is on September 4. In 2018 , Thiru Onam is on August 24. In 2019, Thiru Onam is on September 11. Onam Dates Detailed Information \nFestivities actually commence 10 days before Thiru Onam, on Atham. As per the Malayalam calendar , the dates for 2017 and their significance are as follows: Atham (August 25, 2017) -- is when mythical King Mahabali is believed to have started preparing to come back and visit his kingdom. People begin the day with an early bath, followed by prayers, and the creation of floral arrangements (pookalam) on the ground in front of homes to welcome him. Traditionally, the pookalams are completed with ten rings, each representing a Hindu god. The colors are chosen to please each god, and only yellow flowers are used on Atham for the first layer of the pookalam. However, these days, more importance is given to how elaborate and striking the design is. A grand procession, Athachamyam , marks the start of Onam celebrations near Kochi. \ncontinue reading below our video Tips for Taking Better Travel Photos Chithira (August 26, 2017) -- two more layers are added to the pookalams , using mostly orange and creamy yellow flowers.

Third Onam/Avvittom (September 5, 2017) -- preparations are undertaken for King Mahabali's departure . Onathappan statues are immersed in the sea or river, and pookalams are cleared and removed.
