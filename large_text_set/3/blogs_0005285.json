Trampoline dunks, popcorn fights, even the inflatable ones. I’ve never seen a mascot I didn’t like. Okay, no. The New Orleans Pelicans have some bad ones . But. This. I have never seen anything as great as this. The Phoenix Suns Gorilla just dove onto the court during the middle of play to save a drum stick.\nson. How the drum stick got out there, we’ll never know but the dedication from the mascot to make this save is A+ work. He went into the line of fire to save the team and his reputation. This is the hustle and drive that every mascot should strive to have.\nWhat this doesn’t explain though is that someone playing NBA 2k experienced this before. This is weird.\n@SBNationNBA @SunsGorilla this happened to me like 2 years ago in 2K pic.twitter.com/DF5dYsZss4 \n— Henry Bennett (@henry_bennett3) March 8, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:46:33.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
