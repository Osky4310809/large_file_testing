New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: FAQ: Recommended Power Supplies I was doing it before it was cool Joined: Sep 2012 Warning: Read this before continuing! (Click to show) \nTo be able to view the below tables correctly, you must have the \"View Forums Full Width\" option enabled within your Preferences. It will be mostly functional without doing this, but a portion of the \"Review\" column will be chopped off which is not ideal! \n\nHow do I do this? \n\n1. Hover over your username in the top right of the screen, a pop-up menu will appear. Click \"Preferences\". \n\n\n2. Under the \"Forums\" section of your Preferences, you will see an option called \"View Forums Full Width\". Tick it and click Save! You're done, everything should look as intended. \n\n\nWhat we have here is an extensive, but not exhaustive, list of quality, reliable power supplies. It's a constantly updating resource that will be amended as new relevant products reach the market or current ones end their production cycles. \n\nThe list is mostly comprised of high availability units offered by global brands, if your current power supply isn't among those listed you shouldn't automatically assume it's an inferior, non-recommendable product, there are many other good-to-excellent PSUs sold under a variety of local or regional brands, if you're uncertain about the quality and/or reliability of your PSU just ask, either here or by creating a dedicated thread. \n\nI assume, since you're reading this, that you're aware of the importance of buying and using a quality power supply, so without being a bore I'll just say this: it will allow your hardware to function properly, it will not negatively impact its lifespan and it provides critical electrical protections. \n\nYou can access the manufacturer's product page of each and every unit listed below by clicking directly on it, green units are yet to be released and orange units are new and may not be readily available, links to relevant reviews are also included. Many of the power supplies listed below share the same internals, so for units that lack competent reviews but have mirror products in the list that do have such reviews you'll be forwarded to the respective mirror product's review, these reviews are marked with an asterix*. \n\nFor a proper, comprehensive review database I suggest you visit RealHardTechX , an extensive, easy to navigate and up to date resource. Try to stick to reputable, competent reviewers when doing such research, I'd recommend JonnyGURU , TechPowerUp , Hardware Secrets , HardOCP , PC Perspective , KitGuru and for a touch of exotism IT OCP and Playwares . \n\nOne last thing, before buying anything, do your homework, size your PSU properly and keep an eye on value as well. \n\nLast update: 25 August 2014", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:10:10.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
