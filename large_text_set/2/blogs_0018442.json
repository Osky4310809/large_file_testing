Advertisement \nThe AP reports that most protestors left the camp Wednesday ahead of the evacuation deadline and that their departure was peaceful. During the day Wednesday, the handful of protestors set some of the wooden structures of the camp on fire as part of a leaving ceremony. As the deadline drew near, 75 protestors who remained began to taunt law enforcement, who showed up with five vans as a precautionary measure. Ten protestors were arrested for refusing to heed orders. \nAs night fell on the camp, CNN reports that about 50 to 75 protestors remained in the camp and plans on how and when to remove them have not been made. Protestors who left the camp during the day were bused to Bismarck and provided with fresh clothing, bus tickets home and vouchers for food and hotels.

Phyllis Young, one of the leaders of the camp, told the AP “The camps will continue. Freedom is in our DNA, and we have no choice but to continue the struggle.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:17:46.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
