It’s a privacy violation. What if your mint username is your real name and you don’t want to expose that to irc, which is logged and posted on the web, publicly linking your real name (or at least your Mint login) with your IP address. \nSome users use their real name as their computer login name, and they may want to keep that private and use aliases online. The auto connect and join gives the user no chance to change their nickname or even realize that HexChat somehow has their nickname already set to their mint login name – something that is unexpected. Being pre-configured to autojoin is also unexpected. \nIdeally, have it preloaded with just “new user”, “_newuser” etc, and on first run of hexchat, before connecting, you could prompt the user for a nickname.

I own a Windows 10 and Windows XP license but Mint is what I use.
