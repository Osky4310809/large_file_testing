The book in question, aptly titled What The (Bleep) Just Happened , argues that Barack Obama was a terrible president in his first term. Crowley will serve as Trump’s senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council.

It’s one of those details one would hope a giant publishing house or perhaps a book reviewer would notice, but at least CNN is finally on it. \nCrowley’s intellectual thievery is mostly egregious and includes copying several phrases word-for-word from Politico, the Wall Street Journal , the New York Post , the Associated Press, the New York Times , and Yahoo News.

Many of the instances were copied wholesale from a conservative list of pork barrel spending, with some items dating back to the 1990s. Most of the copied instances were listed on a website for a podiatrist dating back to 2004. \nTrump’s transition team told CNN they are standing by Crowley: \n“Monica’s exceptional insight and thoughtful work on how to turn this country around is exactly why she will be serving in the Administration. HarperCollins—one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world—published her book which has become a national best-seller. Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country.” \nHarperCollins and Crowley did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
