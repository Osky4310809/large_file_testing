This 3,700-square-foot house does have a lot of features we don’t normally see, and we appreciate the excitement over it. It’s listing for $425,000. The five bedroom, three and a half bath house has some updated details, like the kitchen and bathrooms, but we wish they would have spent some time reconfiguring the kitchen. It looks so small, comparatively. There’s a big bar and rec room in the basement, and that media room with a big screen is sure to be a big selling point. There’s nice brick work on the exterior, very shiny wood floors inside, and a hot tub room with skylights. According to the listing, it has, “all of the greatness that you have dreamed about.” K.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:06:04.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
