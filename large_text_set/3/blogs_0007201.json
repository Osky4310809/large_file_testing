When @iamsambee makes fun of your brother for having \"Nazi hair.\" He actually has stage 4 brain cancer, but whatever floats your boat. pic.twitter.com/ULJC8nA3IX — Megan Coddington (@meg_kelly16) March 9, 2017 \nKyle himself tweeted that while other people might have chosen their haircut in homage to the Third Reich, he received his due to cancer. According to OUTSET , where Kyle is a contributor, he recently finished his first round of radiation and chemotherapy. @iamsambee Also, it's not a Nazi haircut. Richard Spencer's is, but mine's from cancer. — Kyle (@_that_kyle) March 9, 2017 \nBee and the show both apologized to Kyle for \"offending\" him, and said that they have removed the clip from the video. @meg_kelly16 We deeply apologize for offending you and @_that_kyle . We only learned of his condition today & have removed him from the piece — Samantha Bee (@iamsambee) March 9, 2017 We deeply apologize for offending @_that_kyle in our CPAC segment. We only learned of his condition today & have removed him from the piece. — Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) March 9, 2017 \nBut...come on. They're only apologizing that they offended him, not for calling him a freaking Nazi. It's not nice to call someone a Nazi for sporting what's (bizarrely, in my opinion) a pretty popular hairstyle . Further, isn't the \"Republicans-are-Nazis-LOL\" trope kind of tired by this point? Full Frontal needs to find another joke, and this time they should try to not insult someone with brain cancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:09:38.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
