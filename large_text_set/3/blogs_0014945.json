Going forward more, that kind of thing, his style suits me more.

The former Liverpool defender revealed he \"loves\" Guardiola (Photo: Getty) \nNeither side did enough to win the game, but City would have felt aggrieved not to have been awarded a penalty for a Milner foul on Raheem Sterling in the area. poll loading Who is the best manager in the Premier League? 5000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:31:57.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
