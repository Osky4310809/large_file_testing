Ghost Recon: Wildlands takes place in a Bolivian landmass where four players comprise a military taskforce sent to disrupt a drug cartel and the government it’s aligned with. While players may have a specific missions—whether it’s to steal some intel or kidnap an informant—how they choose to tackle it is up to them. Guns blazing? Stealth ? Or, as often happens, failed stealth that leads to guns blazing? \nThe open world—the first in Ghost Recon’s ten-game history—promises diverse environments like mountains, forests, and deserts, explorable by ground vehicles, helicopters, and parachutes. The setting is close to modern day, so weapons and gear aren’t as futuristic as they have been in earlier Recon games. Ubisoft is also promising that player choice will affect the world, and that non-violent interactions with NPCs like rebels and civilians can have an impact on missions and goals. And, if your pals aren’t around, you’ll be able to play solo using AI teammates in place of real ones.
