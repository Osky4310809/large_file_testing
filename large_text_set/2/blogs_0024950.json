He will arrive as a nonroster player. The Cardinals expect to formally present Garcia’s deal Saturday, shortly before the Cardinals play their first exhibition game of spring. Garcia received a $2.5-million bonus from the Cardinals. \nGarcia, 24, is a speedy Cuban outfielder who played briefly in Japan last year and was declared a free agent by Major League Baseball in December. \nHe does not count against the Cardinals’ international spending limit, so they will not pay a dollar-for-dollar tax on his contract. The Cardinals have long since blown past their MLB-imposed spending cap on international prospects, and they continue to make a play for some of the market’s highest-end talents. Their international spending has not been curtailed, and that will help the club compensate for the draft picks surrendered to Houston as a penalty for the hacking scandal. \nGarcia is the younger brother of Atlanta third baseman Adonis. The young Garcia was the 2016 MVP of Cuba’s national league, the highest level in the country. The righthanded-hitting outfielder batted .315 with a .395 on-base percentage and a .517 slugging percentage. He hit .322 the previous season. \nBaseball America rated him as the 20th-best Cuban prospect available to a major-league team after he was able to establish residency in a third country. He was described as “one of the most tooled-up players in Cuba.” He has above-average speed and a plus arm, he’s played right field in Serie Nacional, and he’s been utilized in center field during international tournaments. He is viewed as playable in center at the major-league level. As a free-swinger, he connected for 14 homers in his MVP season and struck out 59 times in 380 plate appearances.
