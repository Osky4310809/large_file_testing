The question North Korea watchers are asking: How long will Kim keep his missile program grounded? Some analysts expect testing to resume soon. \"They have a wonderful tradition of greeting every new US President with a bit of fireworks, sometimes a nuclear test, sometimes ICBM launch and they're not going to break this tradition,\" Korean studies professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul told CNN. But Bruce Bennett of the Rand Corporation think tank said Kim's testing hiatus is focused not on Washington, but on Seoul and the impeachment in December of President Park Geun-hye in a corruption scandal. Her fate is now before South Korea's Constitutional Court. A decision against her could trigger elections earlier than the mandated December 20 deadline. \"I believe that North Korea's number one objective between now and the ROK presidential election is to ensure that the new South Korean President will be a progressive, and certainly not a conservative,\" Bennett said, using the acronym for the Republic of Korea. \"But any provocations that it commits would give support to conservative candidates,\" said the senior defense analyst.
