The coroner‚Äôs office revealed that the cause of death is heart disease, with obesity as a contributing factor. \nParamedics were called when the 43-year-old digital media pioneer was found unresponsive, but they were unable to revive him and he was pronounced dead around 5:30 p.m. \nA source also told TMZ that Q had been pushing himself hard at the gym to lose weight ahead of the scheduled February 3 premiere of WorldStar TV , the upcoming MTV2 show where comedians and Hip Hop personalities provide commentary on videos from the site. \nWorldStar posted tributes to O‚ÄôDenat on their social accounts after news of his death went public. \n‚ÄúQ was a brilliant businessman who championed urban culture, ultimately creating the largest hiphop website in the world,‚Äù one tweet said. ‚ÄúBut more than that, he was a devoted father and one of the nicest, most generous persons to ever grace this planet.‚Äù We ask that you remember Q in your prayers and raise a toast to the sky in his name.
