There’s only one problem: Mykhailiuk pretty clearly traveled, but the refs never called it.\nCount the steps: 1, 2, 3. \nKansas State won’t be happy about this, but Bruce Weber’s team certainly played a great game at Allen Fieldhouse. K-State will get another shot at the Jayhawks on Feb. 6, this time at their house.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:34:40.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
