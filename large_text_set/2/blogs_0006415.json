But at $700 a pop, it’s an easy enough urge suppress. The nice thing about the internet, however, is that we can often count on someone else to do our dirty work for us. \nBay Area-based engineering company Mind Tribe tore into a pair of the Back to the Future -inspired sneaks to find out what drives their relatively compact auto-tightening system, no doubt to the chagrin of the innovation team at Nike. \nThe teardown reveals a few interesting tidbits about the system, including a “peripheral connector, which has several unpopulated pins, and even a 3-pin header coming off of it with nothing connected to the other end.” The company suggests this could point to a modular system with peripherals being rolled out for later. \nThe easy money points to a pedometer for future Nike+ integration – something the company told us it had considered in an interview around the shoes’ release. A slightly more far out idea suggests a kinetic-powered system that uses steps to power the shoes’ batteries. \nThe teardown also revealed an ARM Cortex M4, a mobile processor that seems like a lot of firepower for a self-lacing shoe and again, could point to something larger down the road. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:05:21.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
