Day Theresa May’s Budget boob-boosting bra sparked Twitter meltdown 2016 Budget highlight! Day Theresa May’s Budget boob-boosting bra sparked Twitter meltdown BUDGET’S are rarely memorable nor likely to spark social media meltdown – but one year ago today Theresa May’s low cut top and push-up bra combo sparked an internet frenzy! PUBLISHED: 05:18, Wed, Mar 8, 2017 | UPDATED: 07:52, Wed, Mar 8, 2017 IG Theresa May's ample cleavage has caused quite a storm Chancellors come and chancellors go reeling off dubious facts and figures all seemingly designed to make life a little bit harder and budgets blur into one – but 2016 continues to fuel internet memes even today. Mrs May was then a mere Home Secretary but she chose to don a smart red dress suit and spiral necklace - with an impressive helping of cleavage - for the sombre Budget announcement. Eagle-eyed spectators queried whether she was attempting to show her support for austerity measures after wearing the same suit as last year. And they were also quick to notice her lacy red bra peeking out from behind her dress, enhancing her ample chest. Parliament TV Theresa May in the same outfit at last year's Budget announcement Even back in 2015, the outfit caused a storm on social media, with many saying the top Tory politicians’ outfit was a bid to distract from George Osborne’s Budget announcement! Twitter reacted in exactly the same way last year, with many saying they wish Mrs May would “put her boobs away” as it was distracting them from the Budget. The ‘cleavagegate’ debate continued to dominate the headlines for days – but it remains to be seen whether the now promoted Prime Minister will be wheeling out the figure-hugging red combo again today.
