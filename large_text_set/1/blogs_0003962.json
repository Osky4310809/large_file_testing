Giphy \nThere are a few pretty decent clues that are leading people to believe that Zuckerberg is considering a run for president — or at least some sort of government work. \nThe biggest clue is that this past year, Zuckerberg fought to make sure that he could work in the government and still retain his power in the Facebook company, Wired pointed out . \nThe company had a restructuring of its stock in 2016, which made sure Zuckerberg would still be the majority owner of Facebook, should they create more shares of the stock. \nBut one of the updates to the stock is if he owns more than 30 percent of Facebook shares, he can serve in government. \nIf he owns less than that, he needs board approval to serve.
