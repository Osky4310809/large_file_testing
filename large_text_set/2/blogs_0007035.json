You might remember similar events around Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.\nSEE ALSO: Someone built a 60-hour 'Pokémon' game into 'Minecraft' and it's beautiful\nThe Valentine's Day event kicks off at 11 a.m. PT on Feb. 8 and ends at the same time on Feb. 15. Since the big day falls on a Tuesday, running things through the weekend gives trainers a better chance to take advantage.\nDuring the event, all players will receive double the amount of candy when catching, hatching and transferring Pokémon. Buddy Pokémon will also find candy at twice the rate that they normally do.\nIn addition to all of that, players will have an increased chance of catching pink-colored Pokémon during the event. They'll also hatch from eggs in greater numbers.\nFor more information, you can check out the official announce from Niantic right here .\nBONUS: How crazy your office gets when 'Pokémon Go' crashes", "external_links": ["http://pokemongolive.com/en/post/valentines2017", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/eYUYGOVE.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/eYUYGOVE.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-08T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:42:27.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
