Yes, according to some mental health professionals. John Gartner Ph.D, who practices psychology in Maryland, started a Change.org petition on Friday to declare Trump unfit to serve. \n\"We, the undersigned mental health professionals (please state your degree), believe in our professional judgment that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. And we respectfully request he be removed from office, according to article 3 of the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which states that the president will be replaced if he is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” \nIt now has over 24,000 signatures. Some of the signers explained their reasons for supporting the petition. \n\"Clearly we have a malignant narcissist who lives in his own reality and suffers extreme narcissistic injury when his 'reality' is opposed.\" \n\"I am a clinical psychologist and I am concerned about the modeling of bullying, harassment and lying that is being present by our now president.\" \n\"He's a nut job.\" \nDid a similar petition surface after President Obama claimed there were 57 states? Or perhaps when he traded five dangerous Guantanamo Bay prisoners for Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who had abandoned his post and was taken hostage by the Taliban? Nope. They didn't question him because he was President Obama. \nBut, Trump takes a few jabs at the press and he's \"unfit to serve.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:54:26.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
