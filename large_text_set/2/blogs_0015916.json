Excellent storytelling, a bit far fetched at times but at least it was more dominated with legal drama than, well, drama. Thanks for saving my favorite series on TV. I was fearful. Relationship Driven Drama by catcarter Suits never fails to show that relationship is the most important element of drama. The characters are beautifully written, as the actors wonderfully and precisely portray their roles. Each duo, Mike/Harvey, Rachael/Donna, Jessica/Harvey and other combos are rich in friendship, camaraderie, conflict and resolution. The clothing is incredible fashion and each actor carries their own style with stunning finesse. The guest actors are fascinating as they foil and toy with the main characters. Each cast addition enriches an already incredible ensemble. Why aren't you all watching this show? Thanks. SUITS!!! Never enough by Eddie W8 This show has been the best I've seen, from Season 1 to the current Season 6 and beyond I'm sure. Seriously, if you are here and you believe in this show and the cast, you are TRUE SUITS LOVERS. The only thing I'd like to add, is it WOULD be nice to see people Laughing and Smiling more like they did in the Pilot Episode, but I'm sure that will come in time. Let's play this out and see how much better it gets. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:36:52.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
