grenades   06:33   Online \nGunmen, including at least one dressed as a doctor, have attacked a military hospital close to the US embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul and are engaging security forces inside the building, officials and witnesses said. \nA security official said the attack began with an explosion at the rear of the 400-bed Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan hospital and three to five attackers with automatic weapons and hand grenades entered the complex. \nHe said they had taken position on the third and fourth floors of the hospital and were engaging special forces units which had been sent to the scene. Read more Gunmen attack American University in Kabul \nThe attack on the hospital, across the road from the heavily fortified US embassy, underlines warnings by government officials that high profile attacks in Kabul are likely to escalate this year as the Taliban step up their insurgency. \nOne worker at the hospital, Abdul Qadir, told Reuters that he saw one gunman, dressed in a white doctor's coat, take out a concealed AK-47 assault rifle and open fire, killing at least one patient and one hospital worker. \nHe also heard firing from several other points of the hospital, which treats military casualties from around Afghanistan. \nThe area around the hospital, near a busy traffic intersection, was blocked off by security forces.
