(Photo: Oli Scarff, Getty Images) \nSome of the posts tell users to say \"108\" to Siri, then close their eyes. When a user says \"108\" to Siri, it automatically dials local emergency services. The posts ask users to close their eyes because there is a five-second window where a user can press cancel, in case a call was placed accidentally. \nThe prank has prompted police departments to post warnings on Facebook and Twitter urging iPhone owners not to fall for it. There's a social media prank floating around telling people to say, \"Hey Siri, 108\" to their iPhone. Here's why you shouldn't fall for it... pic.twitter.com/Z9pkvqTwxk — DENTON POLICE DEPT (@DENTONPD) March 22, 2017 Don't fall for this #Siri prank! It ties up valuable #911 lines https://t.co/GCwDzDpbaq — NRH Police (@NRHPD) March 21, 2017 There is a online prank going around where people are being told to say \"Hey Siri 108\" into their iPhone.... https://t.co/IPydWfVuJJ — Lewistown Police (@lewistownpolice) March 20, 2017 \nThe number \"108\" is used to dial emergency services in India. It's equivalent to saying \"911\" to Siri in the U.S. It's a feature allowing iPhone users to call emergency services using the digital voice assistant. \n\"If 9-1-1 operators are trying to answer these calls, that means that a real emergency call might not be answered as quickly as it needs to be answered,\" reads a post from the Facebook page for the police department in Lewistown, Pa . \nApple had no comment. \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .
