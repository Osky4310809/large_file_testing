Serving up karaage burgers ($15) and cups of coffee ($4), Kindness On-The-Go food trucks will be visiting business districts to feed the hungry lunch crowds (and give you a chance to do a good deed). \nFor every purchase, you'll be paying it forward and contributing towards meals for migrant workers over Lunar New Year. And since the food trucks are organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement , if you say 'please' and 'thank you' while you're served, you'll get $1 off your order. \nKindness On-The-Go Food Trucks will be at Ocean Financial Centre on Jan 4 & 6, and Entrance of Matrix Building (in front of Starbucks) on Jan 5, 11am-2pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T08:57:29.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
