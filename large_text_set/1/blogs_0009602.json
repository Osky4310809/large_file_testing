Frisno Boström, File BAGUIO CITY — Temperatures in Baguio City has dipped to 11°C early Monday morning, the lowest so far since December 2016. The temperature is expected to further go down until February, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said. Meanwhile, in upland northern Benguet towns like Atok, Mankayan and Kibungan, residents have reported frost in their vast highland vegetable plantations. Agot Balanoy, speaking on behalf of the Benguet Farmers Marketing Cooperative said there were also reports of frost developing in Madaymen in Kibungan, Cada in Mankayan and Paoay in Atok for three days now.Benguet Farmers Marketing Cooperative said there were also reports of frost developing in Madaymen in Kibungan, Cada in Mankayan and Paoay in Atok for three days now. Temperatures in northern Benguet towns are usually 2°C lower than in Baguio City. Frost wilts leafy vegetables, turning them into second class produce at the market, Balanoy explained. Although frost cannot injure maturing vegetables much and they can still harvest it, those planted in the latter part might just wilt, she added. Authorities have yet to release the estimated damage caused by the frost. In December 2016, PAGASA recorded the lowest temperature drop last year at 13.6°C. Kabayan town’s Mt. Pulag, the second highest peak in the country at over 2,900 above sea level, usually records lower temperatures even that of Atok and Baguio City. Baguio recorded its lowest chill at 6.3°C on Jan. 19, 1961. — Artemio Dumlao Nation ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T12:39:49.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
