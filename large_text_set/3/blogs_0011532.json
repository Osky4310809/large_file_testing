House Taken off Field in Ambulance After Being Hit in Head by Line Drive John Raoux/Associated Press Adam Wells Featured Columnist March 10, 2017 Toronto Blue Jays pitcher T.J. House had to be taken off the field in an ambulance during Friday's spring training game against the Detroit Tigers when a comebacker hit him in the head. Per Craig Calcaterra of NBC Sports, Tigers catcher John Hicks hit a line drive that hit off House in the \" head/facial area and caromed 30 feet in the air,\" but he was able to give a thumbs up to the crowd as the paramedics were loading him into the ambulance. Tom Young of the Blue Jays Radio Network tweeted out a picture of the ambulance on the field with Blue Jays coaches and umpires surrounding the area: Tomyoung590 @tomyoung590 Just after being strapped to a stretcher & then put into ambulance #BlueJays TJ House signalled crowd with thumbs up https://t.co/69l3SNoIKd House came on to pitch the bottom of the ninth inning for the Blue Jays. He gave up one hit and recorded one out before getting hit with the liner from Hicks. Per Jason Beck of MLB.com, the decision was made to call the game after House went down. House, a 27-year-old left-hander, was originally drafted by the Cleveland Indians in 2008. He made his MLB debut in 2014 and spent parts of three seasons with the team before becoming a free agent after last season. The Blue Jays signed House to a minor league deal in December. He is competing for a spot in Toronto's bullpen this spring.
