Leila de Lima will be arraigned today at the Quezon City court for disobedience to the summons of Congress over drug-related charges. AP/Bullit Marquez \n  Sen. Leila de Lima will be arraigned today at the Quezon City court for disobedience to the summons of Congress over drug-related charges. \nMeanwhile, the Office of the Solicitor General is preparing for oral arguments tomorrow on why the Supreme Court should reject De Lima’s plea to be released from detention. \nThe arraignment before the Quezon City Metropolitan Trial Court Branch 34 is based on charges filed by Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas, and House committee on justice chairman Reynaldo Umali against De Lima for alleged violation of Article 150 of the Revised Penal Code or “disobedience to summons” by the national assembly or by its committees or subcommittees. \nThe House leaders also accused De Lima of instructing her former driver and lover Ronnie Dayan of ignoring the summons of the House committee on justice, which was investigating the proliferation of illegal drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) when De Lima was justice secretary. \nRagos said he delivered the money to De Lima’s residence in Parañaque City where it was received by Dayan. \nThe violation for disobedience to summons is punishable by one month up to six months imprisonment.   \nDe Lima described the congressional inquiry last year as a “kangaroo court” that secured testimonies of drug convicts just to falsely implicate her on the drug trade at the NBP.
