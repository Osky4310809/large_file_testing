British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson echoed his Saudi counterpart, telling me he thinks Trump will muddle through the chaos of his early days in office. In the long game they may be right. In the short term, Putin is in no mood to wait, and that became clear in the time that we were in Munich. Last week, a watershed was reached, and Putin's patience with Trump fell a foul of pragmatic Washington politics. Embracing the bear, for now, seems out of the question. Ousted national security adviser Mike Flynn's apparently unauthorized flirtation with Moscow proved too toxic for all but the most blinkered of Republicans. So while the Munich conference was still underway, Putin pulled the pin on his own piece of explosive foreign policy. The Russian President signed an executive order and authorized the recognition of documents in the pro-Russian breakaway region of Luhansk and Donetsk -- in effect taking a step closer to recognizing the pro-Russian separatist region. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced a Ukrainian ceasefire, but it appeared to mask Putin's real play: to take another step toward making Russia's role inside Ukraine even more permanent. Formal recognition of breakaway documents is in many diplomats' eyes another step in the direction of formal recognition of the breakaway government. Lawmaker: Trump lawyer pushed Ukraine deal So Putin waiting for Trump to put his house in order with regard to Syria seems unlikely. Which right now is a bit of a problem. By the time delegations arrived in Geneva, Switzerland, for the Syria peace talks, the 30-day deadline Trump gave his defense chief to come up with a new policy to tackle ISIS was already uncomfortably close. The executive order explicitly authorizes the former general, whom Trump still likes to call \"Mad Dog Mattis,\" to find new partners for the United States in the fight against ISIS. At the time the order was written, it seemed the perfect opener for tighter ties with Putin. With Putin looking less like an ally, where that leaves Trump's policy on Syria now is anyone's guess: No doubt it's one of several priorities for Flynn's replacement, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. And with all these foreign policy issues stacking up, what does Trump do? Makes a statement about a terror attack in Sweden that didn't actually happen, leading to a week of confusion and confirming American allies' worst fears about the chaos blizzard currently blowing through the White House. On Sunday, Trump tried to correct himself, tweeting he'd seen a story on Fox News about \"immigrants and Sweden.\" The next day he was backtracking further: \"(M)edia is trying to say that large scale immigration is working out just beautifully. Not!\" In Sweden, tensions temper pride over refugee policy Irrespective of what he intended, Trump's comments fuel the very fears that undermine his pro-NATO message -- that he sent Pence all the way to Europe to deliver. Sweden has not been without serious issues from imported Muslim crime gangs, but Trump's characterization of the country's problems triggered a global backlash, lampooning him for his crass and ill-informed comments -- with suggestions of erecting an IKEA \"border wall\" to recalling ABBA to \"stand guard.\" But the most cutting comment came from former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, whom I first met in Bosnia in the early '90s when he was the European Union's special envoy there. He was then and is today a pragmatic and patient diplomat. He responded to Trump's comments with a clarity revealing the American President's falsehoods: \"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?\" Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Bildt's strong words in the days after the Munich Security Conference were a resounding echo of the sentiments and skepticism I heard about Trump while I was there. With so much on his foreign policy plate, Trump has little time to create more confusion -- such is the mood around the world. The United States is entering an era where losing friends may become far easier than making new ones. In diplomacy that is not usually the chosen path.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:02:43.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
