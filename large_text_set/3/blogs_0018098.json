I think they’re prepared to do more to fight terrorism, to be more engaged. \n[…] \nI don’t think now the public opinion, especially in the U.S. and in other places, would encourage sending troops in large numbers. So I think terrorism — you don’t defeat it by military force only. There are better ways for defeating terrorism, and I think we can do it. \nThe Shiite PM conceded that he had not seen the Trump administration’s specific plan to wipe out ISIS. \n“To be honest, I haven’t seen a full plan. I know there’s a plan,” said Abadi, adding that Iraq has its own strategy. \nNevertheless, he said the entire Middle East “region must have a plan to wipe out terrorism.” \nThe Iraqi leader pointed out that the various Muslim-majority countries, including some covered by Trump’s revised executive order (EO) restricting immigration , are a hotbed for terrorist activities. “In our world, in the region, there are many terrorist activities… in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Libya, and other areas. Yemen as well. So I think we have to stay focused on this,” he told the audience at the USIP event Monday. \n“In our world, in the region, there are many terrorist activities… in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Libya, and other areas. Yemen as well. So I think we have to stay focused on this,” he told the audience at the USIP event Monday. \nPresident Trump’s EO limits immigration from six terror-linked countries — Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. \n“We have to remove terrorism from being used in the region of conflict,” proclaimed PM Abadi, adding, “Daesh [ISIS] was not spontaneous. It was not just born overnight” in Iraq and Syria. \nThe Iraqi prime minister said that the U.S.-backed local forces in Iraq are close to pushing ISIS out of the country, particularly from the Nineveh province’s city of Mosul, believed to be the group’s last remaining stronghold in the nation. \n“We are at the last stage of liberating the whole of Nineveh and after that liberating the whole of Iraq from Daesh [ISIS],” said Abadi. \nAlthough ISIS is close to defeat, ISIS is still receiving funds and foreign fighters, warned the prime minister.
