(Niantic) \nThe new Pokemon Go buddy system is expected to launch today or tomorrow, and trainers everywhere are already preparing to welcome their brand new partner in the game. Although we’ll know more once the feature goes online, new information has emerged regarding which Pokemon will be the most effective buddies. \nPokemon Go Hub took a look at information regarding various species’ spawn rate, the amount of candy needed to evolve them, and the amount of candy gained per kilometer traveled. This was to determine which Pokemon you can evolve most easily just by walking with them as your buddy. They placed Pokemon in five tiers, with the top being the best and the bottom being the worst. \nOf course, you can make any Pokemon your buddy for any reason you choose. But the idea is that it’s a good use of your time to select a Pokemon that will evolve into something relatively rare or that is relatively rare itself, as you may otherwise not be able to catch that creature and gain its candy through regular gameplay. \nThe most efficient Pokemon to use as buddies are evidently Charmeleon, Grimer, Dragonair, Kadabra, and Wartortle. Charmeleon is at the very top of the list; you will reportedly receive one candy for every two kilometers you walk with it, and it will take 100 candies to evolve it into a Charizard. \nThe next most efficient are Machoke, Kabuto, Ivysaur, Metapod, Charmander, Omanyte and Haunter. Kabuto in particular is a pretty good one; it does take three kilometers to get a single candy, but it also will only cost you 50 candies to evolve it into Kabutops. \nHere is Pokemon Go Hub’s ranking of the most effective buddy Pokemon, listed in descending order from most effective to least effective. For detailed information about how they determined their rankings, check out the original post on their website . \nBest Pokemon Go Buddy Pokemon Charmeleon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:06:11.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
