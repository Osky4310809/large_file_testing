Making a whole human being is some complicated sh*t, and it’s incredible that so many moms are so bomb at it . And great TV moms are great too, even if there aren't a lot of them — it’s rare for moms to feel like both like real moms and full, complete people in their own right. There’s something so comforting about watching a TV mom that feels as loving, protective, and genuine as your own. And so, here are eight TV moms that feel like your real mom. 1. Lorelai Gilmore – Gilmore Girls \nNo, nobody’s mom could actually eat that much junk food and stay thin. Lorelai is cool and funny in the way that lots of our moms actually are, even if we don’t realize it when we’re kids. Lorelai is a mom who isn’t just a mom, and the connection between her and Rory is why Gilmore Girls is such a classic. 2. Olivia Benson - SVU \nThe weird thing is that Benson is not a mom. But she is! She doesn’t have any kids, but she’s so maternal towards the victims she helps. I watched SVU reruns all the time my freshman year of college because Benson made me feel comforted. She’s like your mom, but even better at fighting crime. 3. Carol Brady – The Brady Bunch \nIt doesn’t matter that The Brady Bunch is 40 years old, because moms like Carol Brady are timeless. She’s doting, concerned, loving, and always ready with good mom advice. And that hair! What amazing mom hair. 4. Lois – Malcolm in the Middle \nMy mom is usually sweet, patient, and loving, but when you push her too hard, Lois comes out. Usually, Lois was probably a sweet, wonderful woman before she brought her children into the world. This is what happens when people with latent anger issues have crazy kids. 5. Tami Taylor – Friday Night Lights \nTami Taylor isn’t just a mom to Julie and freaky baby Gracie (sorry, I still don’t know why they cast such an ugly baby), but a mom all the students. Tami helps both the over- and under-achievers of Dillon, Texas pursue their dreams. Plus, she plays good cop to Coach Taylor’s bad cop when his players f*ck up. 6. Karen Roe – One Tree Hill \nKaren is either the mom you have or the mom you wish you had. She’s loving, caring, and sweet — a mix between a friend and a mom. 7. Claire Huxtable – The Cosby Show \nClaire is the mix of sweet and sharp that makes a real mom. She loves her family, but she’s willing to rip into them if need be. 8. Elizabeth Jennings – The Americans \nStay with me. Does Elizabeth remind me of my mom in that my mom is a Russian sleeper cell super spy? No. But that’s what makes it even more incredible that Elizabeth is just such a good mom to her kids. She’s just another dorky, sweet, loving, sometimes exasperated working mother. Her kids would never suspect in a million years that she’s a Soviet agent. Which means... any of our moms could secretly be spying for Russia. \nWhich TV moms remind you of your mom?
