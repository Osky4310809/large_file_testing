Instead, the order will be argued on its merits before the Ninth Circuit. \n“The Trump administration as well as the Department of Justice has been weighing the options,” Pamela Brown from CNN reported, “and we have learned from sources that the Department of Justice will not immediately appeal the travel ban ruling to the Supreme Court as of now. \nThe White House, apparently, doesn’t want to take the risk of losing an appeal on the temporary restraining order because of the fear of a four-four split at the Supreme Court, which would leave the Ninth Circuit’s recent ruling in place. That ruling kept the travel ban on hold, of course as you know, that came down yesterday. But they’re still considering reissuing a new re-worked executive order. The source I spoked with cautioned though that a new order risks making the current lawsuit moot, which the administration may not want to do because it believes it could ultimately win the case on the merits. #BreakingNews video: Citing sources, @NBCNews reports that the Trump @WhiteHouse won't appeal travel ban to SCOTUS pic.twitter.com/DhUFLnKdKw \n— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) February 10, 2017 \nArgue away. \nLet’s get this done. \nTrump was well within his right as chief executive of this nation to do what he did. Should be a slam dunk. \nShould be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:07:18.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
