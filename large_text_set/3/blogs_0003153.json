Her voice, oh my god, her voice is amazing. Her song writing is beautiful and totally relatable, she knows exactly what I’m going through. She is who she is as an artist. I cannot wait for the entire world to get a load of her vision. She’s who I want to be when I grow up, and that’s saying a lot because she’s a lot younger than me. So get ready, everybody, because 2017 is about to be Noah’s year. Tonight, she is joined by the incredibly talented Labrinth, give it up for my favorite person in the entire world, my little sister Noah Cyrus.
