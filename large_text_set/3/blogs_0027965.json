Now it’s ‘murder’ Christie Blatchford: Mother displays strange egoism, entitlement as facts of son Alex Radita’s death laid out ‘He was a skeleton’: ‘No excuse’ for 15-year-old’s death, investigator tells trial of parents charged with murder Defence lawyers Jim Lutz and Andrea Serink had sought convictions for manslaughter, arguing the parents incompetently managed their son’s diabetes and were unable to ascertain the significant risk his illness caused him.\nBut Horner said the parents’ conduct amounted to much more.\n“The Raditas were well aware how ill Alex was and still refused to treat his medical condition with proper insulin protocol and medical care,” she said.\n“They knew he was dying.”\nThe couple were aware death would be the ultimate consequence of their refusal to get him proper medical care.\n“Alex’s extremely emaciated state was clearly, common sensibly, the result of a prolonged period of malnutrition,” Horner said.\nThe boy was “emaciated to the point where he appeared mummified” when found dead.\nShe described the scene which greeted paramedic Deborah Baumback when she arrived at the Raditas’ Citadel home.\n“His face had no visible flesh left as she could see every bone in his face,” the judge said.\n“There was nothing left of his stomach as he was just so skinny.”\nFollowing the verdict, Crown prosecutor Susan Pepper lamented that Alexandru “lived and died very much alone.”\nPepper said the fact there was no one there for the teenage to speak about the impact of his death, save for a social worker who dealt with him eight years earlier, spoke volumes about his loneliness.\n“It really highlights the degree of isolation that Alex lived in — he had no friends, or teachers, or support people, or doctors, or anyone,” Pepper said.\nEmil Radita has not yet filed an appeal.\nLeah Hennel/Postmedia News Emil Radita, left, and his wife, Rodica Radita, were convicted of the first-degree murder of their 15-year-old son Alex in Calgary on May 7, 2013.
