Cory Booker after Newark diss Updated: March 24, 2017 — 2:17 PM EDT 367 Share \nNick Vadala writes about food and entertainment for Philly.com. More by Nick Vadala Arrow icon \nNewark is for lovers. Or, at least it might be when actress Mindy Kaling and Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) paint the town red on an agreed-upon dinner date that resulted from a dig at the city on The Mindy Project this week. \nThis week’s episode of the show had Kaling’s fictional counterpart, Mindy Lahiri, surprised that the New Jersey senator agreed to attend a colleague’s event on the show. \n“Cory Booker? I can’t believe he came,” Kaling-as-Lahiri said on the show. “I guess anything to get out of Newark, huh?” \nBooker took notice of the joke, tweeting at the actress on Thursday that he disagrees with the character’s take on the city, but still loves Kaling’s work. He also posted a link to a recent Vogue article that explores Newark’s revitalization from the perspective of the fusion restaurants that have popped up in the city. \nOuch! �� @MindyKaling , heard Dr. Lahiri dissed Newark last night ��... @VogueMagazine & I disagree ✌��: https://t.co/2wP7ZqJKQd (I still ❤️U!) pic.twitter.com/FSwfkxenQJ \n— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) March 23, 2017 \nKaling, meanwhile, noted that if Lahiri doesn’t like something, it almost certainly means that that thing is cool. \nSenator, if Mindy Lahiri shades it, it means we know it's cool. Thanks for the ❤. It's mutual! https://t.co/KW2ibviREc \n— Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) March 23, 2017 \nBooker then heated things up with a dinner-date invitation for Kaling, asking her to have a night out in Newark with him. \nYou are making my day! Thanks for the clarification. And If the ❤️is really mutual... Come have dinner with me in Newark? #PleaseSayYes ���� https://t.co/fI9IYJYZEX \n— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) March 23, 2017 \nThe Project actress accepted Booker’s invitation, and told him she needed to check the PATH train schedule. (The PATH is the rail line that runs into Jersey from New York City.) \n@CoryBooker yes. Now let me get the PATH train schedule. \n— Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) March 23, 2017 \nBooker, however, really turned up the romance after that point, telling Kaling that she is “Lyft worthy,” and that he would make sure she had transportation door-to-door. \n�� ��Thank you! PATH train is awesome when you are Jersey bound. But you are @Lyft worthy! I will send one to you for the door to door. https://t.co/hTHqqyXLZn \n— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) March 23, 2017 \nWhen and where exactly the two will dine, however, wasn’t discussed, at least in public. Newark residents will just have to keep an eye out.
