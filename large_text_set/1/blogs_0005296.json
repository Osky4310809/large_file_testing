I feel like I’m watching the Paramount Pictures title sequence (you know, the one with the stars and the snowy mountain) come to life. Or, like, the opening sequence to a huge blockbuster movie right before it kicks off its first action scene.

Of course, you’d probably need some drone flying skills, too, because otherwise you’d probably end up crashing it on the side of the mountain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:45:57.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
