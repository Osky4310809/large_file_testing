First, it’s the dream-like outfit, its many accomplices but, disappointingly, jewellery is relegated to the final leg. Seldom do we hear a story where the jewellery, alone, inspires the entire shindig. Well, it’s time that we hold our bridal baubles in equal reverence as our wedding outfits, if not more. Let’s make a pact to look beyond the signature kundans and polkis. And, finally, let’s all commit to have fun. Your jewellery has all the makings of a showstopper. Here’s how you can get your bling game to inspire the lives of your wedding attendees. Vacate The Neck \nSkip on the customary necklace and, instead, sport statement-makers elsewhere. Take the load off your neck on the day of your mehendi. A cool-girl mathapatti, thrown in with photogenic chandbaalis, should serve the brief.

Take liberties with your layered pieces; use the longer necklaces to introduce colour. White-wearing brides have the spectrum to choose from, while the bright colour endorsers can front a complimenting shade (think green if you have chosen a bright red). A photo posted by Pooja Joseph Photography (@poojajosephphotography) on Jan 7, 2017 at 11:52pm PST Embrace Colour \nStep away from the one-toned kundan jewellery, and find ways to infuse colour. Much like print on print, pick on your outfit’s embroidery and channel those details in your bridal pieces… or as a point of reference, use a dominating hue. Either way, do invest in colourful jewellery while doing something different. A photo posted by Anjie Gogna-Dhawan (@anjiegogna) on Jan 4, 2017 at 6:58pm PST Reinvent Layering \nThere is more to the art of layering than hanging the choker-long strings combo. Build your personalised pack by pairing (and contrasting) individual pieces. That way, rather than burning all your dough on a consuming neckpiece, you can develop a fairly wearable collection with easy-to-style pieces. Black and White Films Take A Traditional Leap Let your culture inspire your jewellery choices. Like this south Indian bride, whose Kasulaperu (coin necklace) is the real MVP of her bridal outfit. Whether it’s a Punjabi maang-tikka or a Rajasthani nath, you will be pleasantly surprised in the number of ways your roots can elevate your big-day statement.
