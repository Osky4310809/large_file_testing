They have also proven to be savvy entrepreneurs creating a jingle -- \"Dab Of Ranch\" -- to go along their special flavor of Rap Snacks potato chips. \nIndeed, Offset is so fond of the product that he bought out a convenience store's stock of Migos-flavored Rap Snacks. The ATL rapper carted away all the \"Dab Of Ranch\" potato chips and left the other flavors on the shelves. A video has been circulating online showing Offset's extravagant purchase. \n\"You got to buy your own product when you see it in the store,\" he says in the video, flashing a large wad of money while he dances. \nThe group has become a true phenomenon since Culture dropped a few weeks ago. No doubt, they want to inspire the new generation in more ways than just a dance and a few songs. \nWatch the video below to see why Offset carries so much money on him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:57:54.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
