Northwestern made the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history this season, and it beat Vanderbilt 68-66 in a thrilling contest that came down to the final seconds. Bryant McIntosh drilled two free throws to take the lead after Vanderbilt's Matthew Fisher-Davis committed an inexcusable foul in the backcourt with his team leading by one. Riley LaChance then missed a three for Vanderbilt, and the Wildcats clinched their first NCAA tournament win after Vanderbilt's desperation heave didn't fall. LaChance made a layup to give the Commodores the lead with less than 20 seconds left, but Fisher-Davis didn't realize the game situation, as he fouled McIntosh even though Northwestern was in the bonus. The 86.1 percent free-throw shooter calmly drilled the freebies to end a sequence that lived up to the March Madness moniker: Bleacher Report @BleacherReport 3/16/2017, 10:41:27 PM Joseph Goodman of AL.com tweeted, \"That Vandy kid is going to be voted into the Northwestern Sports Hall of Fame.\" Northwestern head coach Chris Collins will go down in school history as the first to lead the Wildcats to an NCAA tournament win. It is a reward for the gradual improvement he has demonstrated after going 14-19 in his first season with the team, 15-17 in his second, 20-12 in his third and now leading the team to the Big Dance. He made his father and former NBA coach and player Doug Collins sweat Thursday: Bleacher Report @BleacherReport", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:46:56.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
