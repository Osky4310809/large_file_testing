While Hennessey was still on campus, the university announced that women’s hockey would be among the sports cut after the 2016-17 academic year.

From the Grand Forks Herald : Advertisement \n“This puts me in a very tough situation,” Hennessey said. “My dream of playing Division I hockey is now slim-to-none.” \nThe current players had to wait to find out the official news, too, although the school will reportedly honor the athletic scholarships for the discontinued sports. \nWith this decision, North Dakota will be eliminating an excellent source of talent for national teams. Eight current or former Fighting Hawks were picked for team rosters for the 2017 IIHF Women’s World Championship, and the program has produced Olympians, including Americans Jocelyne and Monique Lamoureux, who were both pissed off: \nSenior Halli Krzyzaniak was also furious, particularly by how the team was informed: \nThe elimination of women’s hockey will save UND $1.9 million, according to records.
