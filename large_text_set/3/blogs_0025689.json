Juncker says BRITISH politicians caused Brexit by encouraging immigration 'Not OUR fault!' Juncker says BRITISH politicians caused Brexit by encouraging immigration JEAN-CLAUDE Juncker today took a swipe at successive British governments as he accused them of causing Brexit by wrongly blaming Brussels for their own open door migration policies. PUBLISHED: 15:12,   15:46, Fri, Mar 24, 2017 GETTY Jean-Claude Juncker said British politicians are to blame for Brexit \nIn candid remarks the EU Commission chief said UK ministers had repeatedly pointed the finger at Europe as a way of covering up for their unpopular decisions and mistakes. \nIn particular he said the reason EU migration is such a big issue in Britain compared to other member states was because politicians here had actively encouraged people to come in large numbers.

EbS The EU Commission chief said the UK had encouraged migration GETTY But Brussels was obstinate on some issues too, such as David Cameron's migrant benefit reforms \nAnd he did not mince his words in his assessment of how senior British politicians have acted over recent decades, saying they are largely responsible for the growth in euroscepticism. \nHe wrote: “For too long there has been a gap between what people expect and what Europe is able to deliver. \n“We should not pretend Europe can solve all problems. ‘Brussels’ should not have been constantly blamed in British political discourse for things the EU is not responsible for - we now know the result of such rhetoric.” \nHe pointed out that the EU has virtually no influence over the spheres of healthcare, education and welfare policy which are often so contentious in UK elections. \nIn reality Brussels does hold significant sway over the latter of those three, as David Cameron discovered when he tried and failed to gain minor concessions over migrants’ access to benefits. ‘Brussels’ should not have been constantly blamed in British political discourse for things the EU is not responsible for Jean-Claude Juncker \nThe EU also enforces a strict free movement policy which technically means, as many Leave supporters pointed out, that the Government cannot control numbers arriving from Europe. \nHowever, Mr Juncker’s assertion that Britain has actively encouraged EU migration and in particular an influx of cheap, low-skilled labour from Eastern Europe will resonate. \nUnder Tony Blair the UK was the only major nation not to impose transitional controls when the eastern bloc entered the club in 2004, whereas France and Germany both put up barriers for eight years. \nBritain also does not implement many of the control measures it is legally allowed to by Brussels, such as requiring people from other EU countries to register with authorities so that accurate numbers can be determined. \nOn top of that, Government statistics show that immigration from the rest of Europe still makes up less half of people coming to the UK every year, although it has grown substantially over the past decade. Brexit: Results of how the UK voted Mon, March 20, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland Getty Images 1 of 8 GREAT YARMOUTH: The town of Great Yarmouth on the East Coast of England voted by 72% to leave the European Union. \nThe EU boss wrote: “On the fourth – immigration – free movement is integral to the EU’s single market, which the UK has always strongly supported, and which is a right with clear limits. \n“Furthermore, most immigration to Britain comes from outside the EU, where policy is made by the UK alone. \n“It is also the UK that decides on the structural economic issues that have led to high demand from British employers for migrant labour.” \nEU leaders are congregating in Rome today for a crucial summit to mark the 60th birthday of the bloc, at which they hope to agree on a way forward post-Brexit. \nMr Juncker has drawn up five “pathways” he believes European leaders can choose from, although he has personally admitted he thinks a sixth option “designed by the people” will be the best route to success.
