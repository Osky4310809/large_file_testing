Cron crushes a solo home run over the wall in center field to tie the game at 5 in the top of the 6th inning By Adam McCalvy / MLB.com | @AdamMcCalvy | + 0 COMMENTS \nPHOENIX -- Carlos Perez doubled home two of the Angels' four runs in the first inning, and C.J. Cron and Ryan LaMarre homered in a four-run sixth on the way to an 8-6 win over the Brewers on Wednesday at Maryvale Baseball Park. \nIn the finale of both teams' Arizona slates, the Brewers tallied 15 hits, including home runs by Jesus Aguilar and Travis Shaw . Shaw's two-run shot in the fifth was his fourth of Spring Training, and briefly gave the Brewers a 5-4 lead. But he was just as eager to marvel at Aguilar's scorching spring, which included seven homers, and was good enough to earn the slugger a spot on Milwaukee's bench. \n\"I've never seen a spring like this. Never,\" Shaw said. \"And it's not just ambushing first pitches, either. He's getting into counts, hitting the ball the other way.\" Aguilar's solo home run LAA@MIL: Aguilar launches a solo home run to left Jesus Aguilar crushes a home run over the left-field wall to cut the Brewers' deficit to 4-2 in the bottom of the 2nd inning \nFor the Angels, Matt Shoemaker closed out his spring by giving up three runs and nine hits in four innings. \n\"Just maybe a little off, which is good to recognize when you're out there, and make adjustments,\" said Shoemaker, who is in line to be the Angels' Opening Day starter, though the team has yet to announce its rotation. \"I'm ready to go. It's exciting. Everybody's ready to go.\" Shoemaker induces double play LAA@MIL: Halos turn double play behind Shoemaker Matt Shoemaker gets Jett Bandy to ground into a 5-4-3 double play for the first two outs in the bottom of the 4th inning \nZach Davies started for Milwaukee and bounced back from the Angels' four-run opening inning to pitch three scoreless frames in his final tuneup for a start in the Brewers' second game of the season. \n\"I was happy with being able to get back into a groove in a couple of those innings,\" Davies said. \"I'm ready for the season to start. I think everybody's ready to go.\" LaMarre's two-run home run LAA@MIL: LaMarre launches a two-run shot to center Ryan LaMarre crushes a two-run home run to deep center field, extending the Angels' lead to 8-5 in the top of the 6th inning \nAngels Up Next: The Angels open a three-game exhibition Freeway Series against the Dodgers at 7:07 p.m. PT on Thursday, which will be live on MLB.TV . Yusmeiro Petit will start opposite Kenta Maeda . The first two games in the series will be at Angel Stadium, while the third is set for Dodger Stadium. \nBrewers Up Next: Ryan Braun and the Brewers broke camp Wednesday afternoon and headed north to Milwaukee, where they will host the White Sox for the first of two exhibition games at at 7:10 p.m. CT on Friday. Matt Garza gets the start in a game set to air exclusively via Brewers.com webcast. Braun did not play Wednesday's Arizona finale, so he's a good bet to play Friday night along with the rest of the regulars. \nWatch every out-of-market regular-season game live on MLB.TV . has covered the Brewers for MLB.com since 2001.
