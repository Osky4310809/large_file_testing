Five are dead , and many more injured. Advertisement \nAccording to the Guardian, approximately 40 people were inside the mosque during the attack. The mosque’s president, Mohamed Yangui, was not present, but received panicked calls alerting him to the shooting. He confirmed the death toll, but because the injured were taken to various hospitals in Québec City, is unsure of their number. \n“Why is this happening here? This is barbaric,” he said to the Guardian. Advertisement \nThe mosque has been targeted before, though the circumstances were far less deadly — but nonetheless grotesque. In June, during Ramadan, a pig’s head was left at the building. \nReports indicate that tonight’s shooting will be treated as an act of terrorism. A police spokesperson says that two arrests have already been made. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued a statement via Twitter. \nAnd Ralph Goodale, Canada’s publics safety minister, tells the Guardian that he “is deeply saddened” by the bloodshed.
