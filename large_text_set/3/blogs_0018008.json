Ellen Page will return as Juno, the pregnant teen, and Jennifer Garner will reprise her role as Vanessa, the adoptive mother — but the roles played in the film by Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, and J.K. Simmons will all be filled by women at the live read. The full cast will be announced on Twitter by director Jason Reitman days before the show. \"Considering how much this election has done against women and what Planned Parenthood has done for women I thought it would be cool to hear this script with an all-female voice,\" Reitman told Entertainment Weekly . \nThe Juno live-read will sell original artwork and signed memorabilia from the film, and the proceeds, along with ticket sales , will all be donated to Planned Parenthood. The organization is currently at risk of being defunded, with Republicans citing its abortion services as the impetus for slashing federal funding. However, only 3% of Planned Parenthood's many reproductive health services — which include cancer screenings, pregnancy tests, STD treatment, and birth control — are dedicated to ending pregnancies. \n\"Like many other people, I felt like I wanted to do something. I wanted to find a way to contribute to the causes that have never felt more important,\" Reitman told EW . \"It occurred to me that I have this show that could be used as a tool to not only raise money for causes that need the help, but could serve as an opportunity for a group like Planned Parenthood to connect with an audience who can be presented with new ideas, or even an action item.\" \nReitman adds: \"If there was any confusion about whether Juno was pro-choice or pro-life, this should settle that. Juno had a choice, and that was the most important part.\" \nThe Juno live-read will mark the return of Reitman's live script-reading series, which ran for five seasons but was retired last April. The 2016 election inspired Reitman to revive it, and Juno will be the first show of many in his \"Resistance-inspired lineup,\" which promise to touch on other hot-button topics, such as immigration and the fake-news epidemic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:59:10.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
