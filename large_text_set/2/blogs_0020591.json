The map was created by Molly Roy with help from the ELA, and also shows libraries, museums, and other linguistic centers. \n\"The capital of linguistic diversity, not just for the five boroughs, but for the human species, is Queens,\" Solnit and Jelly-Schapiro write. \nThe five miles from Astoria to Forest Hills have a dense progression of languages: Greek, Filipino, Urdu, Indonesian, Russian, Japanese, Lithuanian, and others, including more obscure ones like Chavacano, Waray-Waray, Minangkabau, and Bukharian. Here’s a close-up: Image: Business Insider \nOne limit of the map is that every language shows up only once, when in fact many show up throughout the borough. Mandarin, for instance, is listed in Flushing, which is Queens' original Chinatown, but not in Elmhurst, which also has a prominent Chinese community. \nFlushing also has pockets of Cantonese, Shanghainese, Taishanese, Sichuanese, and other dialects. Korean and Mongolian are nearby, too. A close-up: Image: Business Insider \nSolnit has also published atlases of San Francisco and New Orleans .
