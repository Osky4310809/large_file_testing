I felt good today,’’ said Carter who singled in four at-bats.\nSince it was learned Didi Gregorius would be out until at least the early part of May with a right shoulder injury Girardi has started Ronald Torreyes, Tyler Wade and Pete Kozma at short.\nSEE ALSO \nYankees expect Didi Gregorius to be out until May 0:0 TAMPA — Don’t look for Didi Gregorius at shortstop until the... That leaves Ruben Tejada and second baseman Starlin Castro as the only two names mentioned as possible replacements for Gregorius who haven’t started a game at short this spring. \nGirardi said he plans on giving Tejada time at short and might use Castro on the other side of the bag just to be prepared if he needs him there.\n“We are going to talk. I am not sure who is scheduled there. Castro going over there really depends who we take, but it is probably worth getting him over there,’’ Girardi said of his most experienced shortstop on the roster. “I don’t think it’s such a big deal for him.’’\nTorreyes, who can play second, short and third, started at third Thursday and went 2-for-3 with a towering homer to left.\nThe right-field competition between Aaron Judge and Aaron Hicks might go to the day before Opening Day and each outfielder had a solid game Thursday.\nSEE ALSO \nYankees may not start Aaron Judge in right field after all 0:0 CLEARWATER, Fla. — Forget five pitchers fighting for two rotation... Judge went 2-for-3 with a double and an RBI. Hicks had one hit in two at-bats and drove in a run with a double. He also made a sliding catch on Mallex Smith’s fly ball in the third inning.\n“Both had good days and that is a good thing. We will figure that out, too,’’ said Girardi, who also is looking for a fourth starter and Gregorius’ replacement.\nGirardi said he wasn’t surprised to hear Masahiro Tanaka thought he “was all over the place’’ Wednesday after shutting out the Phillies across 5 ¹/₃ innings.\n“We all have gotten accustomed to that. He expects perfection and he is going to strive for it every time he goes out. He could find something wrong in a perfect game,’’ Girardi said of his Opening Day starter who is 3-0 this spring and hasn’t allowed a run in 18 ²/₃ innings. “I know he made some mistakes with the fastball that he is working on, but I was happy with it, I didn’t have a whole lot of complaints.’’\nTorreyes was knocked down by a 95-mph pitch over his head from the Rays’ Jumbo Diaz in the fifth inning in Port Charlotte, Fla., and the diminutive infielder responded with a single to right-center. \nA Yankees run in the ninth tied the score, 5-5, and set up the possibility of extra innings, which should be banned in spring training games. Luckily the game ended in a tie and in nine frames.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T12:22:07.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
