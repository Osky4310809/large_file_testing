One of the Federal Security Service officers detained has been accused of providing information to the United States, according to Novaya Gazeta, a Russian opposition newspaper. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The United States and Europe have imposed an array of sanctions on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine and for human rights abuses at home. Before leaving office, Mr. Obama imposed additional sanctions and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for that country’s interference in American elections. Lifting them, critics said, would cause a rift between the United States and Europe. “That’s going to lead to disunity and exactly what Putin wants,” said Michael McFaul, who served as ambassador to Russia under Mr. Obama. “What could be better for him? Not only the act of sanctions’ being lifted but the process of disunity and disarray within the European Union. That’s a giant gift to him.” Senate Republicans may have slowed Mr. Trump on sanctions after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, said he would favor bipartisan legislation requiring that sanctions stay in place. Mr. Trump tried to play down the prospect at a news conference with Mrs. May on Friday, saying it was “very early to be talking about” sanctions relief. But he did not disavow it, and government officials said there had been discussion of what to do on sanctions since Mr. Trump’s team took over. Joining Mr. Trump in the Oval Office for his phone call with Mr. Putin was Vice President Mike Pence ; Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist; Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary; and Mr. Flynn. The Kremlin said the two leaders talked about the Middle East, including the Syrian civil war; the Islamic State ; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; and Iran’s nuclear program , although it gave no specifics. North Korea and strategic nuclear arms came up, as did “key aspects of the Ukraine crisis,” the statement said. “It was agreed to cooperate on these and other issues,” the Russian statement said, “but the priority was placed on uniting forces in the fight against the main threat — international terrorism.” But an American official, who was briefed on the call but not authorized to discuss it publicly, said Ukraine did not come up in any real detail, and sanctions did not come up at all. Still, a leading member of Russia’s Parliament, Dmitri Novikov, said that mention of bolstering trade ties suggested that sanctions relief was coming. “To fully develop economic ties, it’s necessary to create the right climate and legal conditions, and that requires canceling sanctions,” he told the Interfax news agency. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Others seemed to be expecting the same. Soon after the call, a Russian government investment fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, announced it had arranged more than 10 projects it hoped could draw American investment to Russia, and that it planned to open an office in New York in May. “Focus on recovery of Russia-U.S. trade and economic ties is very important,” the organization’s chief executive officer, Kirill Dmitriev, said in a statement. “The outcome of the first phone conversation between presidents of Russia and the U.S.A. is a positive signal for business.” Mr. Trump also spoke on Saturday with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan . He invited Mr. Abe to visit the White House on Feb. 10. “President Trump affirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to ensuring the security of Japan,” the administration said in a statement, a commitment that had been in doubt among some in Tokyo after some of Mr. Trump’s statements during the campaign. \nPeter Baker reported from Washington, and Andrew E.
