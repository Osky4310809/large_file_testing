Biggest Change \nThe most significant change is that as of 3/29, shoppers can no longer combine a raincheck with a paper coupon. As we all know, this is one of the ways couponers are able to get the best deals when the store is out of stock. \nWith some of the fabulous sales, the stock is depleted in hours and the stores are not always able to get sufficient stock before the sale ends. When shoppers can get a raincheck and use it to get the sale price the next week when the shelves are restocked, being able to use a coupon with the raincheck means that they can get the good deal they had planned to get the previous week when the store was out of the sale item. \nWith this new policy, shoppers will only be able to get the sale price. They will not be able to get the sale price and use a coupon, as they could have done during the week the sale was valid (but the store was out of stock). \nThis will also change the entire dynamic of Super Doubles because some of the best deals were found using rainchecks and coupons combined. That will no longer be an option. \nIf Harris Teeter is looking to send a clear message to couponers, their mission has been accomplished. Expiration Date \nThe other change to the policy is that rainchecks now expire in 60 days. Until now, there was no expiration date. \nWill these changes influence your Harris Teeter shopping habits? Leave a comment in the Comments section with your thoughts. \nBelow is the policy that has been updated at HarrisTeeter.com. Raincheck Policy **** Rainchecks expire 60 days from date of issue and are accepted at any Harris Teeter store. * effective 3/29/2017 (this is new to the policy) **** Rainchecks cannot be combined with any paper coupon for the same item. *effective 3/29/2017 (this is new to the policy) Rainchecks can be issued for items out of stock during coupon promotions for the sale price of the item only. We reserve the right to limit raincheck quantities based on product availability and advertised limits. Rainchecks can be written for a limit of three or three “deals” unless otherwise stated in the ad. We do not reissue rainchecks for quantities not purchased at time of redemption. For deals where the pricing may vary, the customer must pay the highest of the amounts. Rainchecks cannot be combined with current sale price. \nAccording to a local store manager, unredeemed existing rainchecks will expire May 31, 2017.
