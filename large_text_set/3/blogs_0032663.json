Lack of access disproportionately affects low-income groups, the disabled, and the elderly. \n“The Mayor needs to ensure new developments have access to free cash, and encourage public buildings to include free cash machines.” \nThere are already approximately 120 free-to-use cash machines at more than 60 stations on the Tube network, according to figures provided by the Mayor’s office. Transport for London are said to be working to identify new locations for free ATMs. \nDespite the number of free cash machines across the country nearly doubling since 2007, there were 84 million withdrawals from fee-paying machines last year, out of a total 2.8 billion cash withdrawals. \nThis year is the 50th anniversary of London’s first automatic teller machine, which was installed at the Enfield branch of Barclays in June 1967. Major banks prepare to shift operations away from London after Brexit \nHowever, technological shifts have signalled an exodus of bank branches from the high street, with another 22 slated to close in London by the end of the year, according to This Is Money. \nMr Bailey said: “With bank branches closing and fee-charging machines becoming the norm it is no surprise Londoners are spending £18million on cash withdrawals.” \nA spokesman from Sadiq Khan’s office said City Hall would consider encouraging public buildings to install ATMs, but said planning regulations could not dictate they must be free to use. \nHe added: “While Sadiq acknowledges that the availability of free cash points is important, he also recognises that issues of financial inclusion run far deeper and that some individuals need more help to manage their own finances competently. \n“In addition, he is aware that some Londoners still do not have bank accounts, the ability to save and do not insure their homes and belongings against the risk of fire or theft. Combined, these are significant symptoms and causes of social inequality and need to be tackled strategically.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:03:36.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
