By Karan Shah | Published: February 25, 2017 11:03 am In Focus: Kareena Kapoor spotted in Dubai! \nWe revealed to you a few days back how Konkana Sen Sharma ‘s next film – Lipstick Under My Burkha was denied certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). In their letter to the makers, the CBFC mentioned the reasons why they had denied certification and we have to say they were quite clearly shocking. After the letter hit the internet, the Twitterati and many celebs from the industry slammed this decision. And now Konkana Sen Sharma has come out and slammed the board and questioned how we as a country be so intolerant? \nAs Konkona Sen Sharma mentioned to Bombay Times, “How can CBFC not certify the film at all? This is ridiculous. Is the film being rejected just because it deals with female fantasies? Most Indian films are about male fantasies, what about them? Now, if a film is made on women’s sexuality, it is refused to be certified! It’s a film for adults, and it should get an A certificate. We are not asking children to watch it. What I can’t understand is its out right rejection. It is sad how adults have the right to vote, but not watch a film of their choice.” \nAfter being denied certification, Prakash Jha (producer) is now planning to approach the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal(FCAT). However, Konkana is not that hopeful. As she added, “Any film that is not aspirational and deals with a part of dark reality is not approved by the board. Lipstick Under My Burkha is about four women from Bhopal and the strict codes of behaviour that they are supposed to follow. How are we supposed to portray these, if not the way we have shown in the film? Why are we becoming such an intolerant country? A peaceful seminar in Delhi University is opposed; a film that is slightly different from the usual is refused to be certified. Isn’t this zor-zabardasti?” ALSO READ – Shocking! CBFC rejects certification of Prakash Jha’s next as it challenges patriarchy? \nObviously, the heat will be on Pahlaj Nihalani and CBFC once again. But will a permanent solution ever come out? Well time will tell. Just to recap a bit, as per the letter from the CBFC, the reasons for denying certification to Lipstick Under My Burkha were –“The story is lady-oriented, their fantasy, above life. There are contentious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society.” ALSO READ – Twitterati slams CBFC for denying the certification of Lipstick Under My Burkha – check tweets \nDo you think these reason are justified?
