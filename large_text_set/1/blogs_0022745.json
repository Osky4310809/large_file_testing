Trade Union Congress, TUC; National Union of Electricity Employees, NUEE and Senior Staff Association of Electricity and Allied Companies, SSAEAC, moved around the major streets of Enugu metropolis before stopping at the EEDC office, Okoara Avenue, Abakaliki Road, Enugu. \nSome of the placards read: “We say no to indiscriminate sacking of workers, arbitrary and crazy billing, poor working condition, ritual of burning live cows, high bill, more darkness, no metre for customers,” among others. \nReacting to the protest march, Head of Communication of the company, EEDC, Emeka Eze, condemned the protest, saying they should have embarked on dialogue rather than take the fight to the streets. \nLeader of National Union of Electricity Employees, NUEE, Mr Joe Ajaero, who spoke on behalf of the protesting workers, said the union was on picketing exercise against EEDC for arbitrary sacking of staff. \nAjaero said that the union had met with the required rules before embarking on the picketing. \nEEDC, last week, sacked no fewer than 400 staff and replaced them with alleged compromised new staff. \nEEDC reacts \nBut in a reaction, the leader of Senior Staff Association of Electricity and Applied Company, SSAEAC, Christian Okonkwo, lamented the poor management of the company, saying the sacked staff were not qualified to handle the company. \n“They were not qualified to manage the company. They were just collecting money from people without service,” Okonkwo said. \n“EEDC embarked on a restructuring exercise last year. This was brought to the attention of representatives of the union at some of our sessions last year. After this exercise, some job positions were abolished as they were no longer relevant; staff were assessed and some of them that could not defend their positions/jobs were eventually disengaged; while we also hired additional staff to beef up our technical and customer service team. \n“The decision of the management was in the interest of the organisation and was not in any way meant to witch-hunt any staff; the process was transparent and fair.” \nEBSU students, consumers protest in Ebonyi \nSimilarly, no fewer than 50 electricity consumers and students of Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki, yesterday, embarked on a peaceful protest to drive home their demand for effective power generation and distribution across the state. \nThe protest paralysed business operations at the branch headquarters of EDDC in Ebonyi State for over two hours. \nVanguard gathered that the protesters shut offices of the company and barricaded all roads leading in and out of the headquarters in Abakaliki. \nThe protesters, who were later joined by the students of Ebonyi State University, carried placards with various inscriptions such as: “EDDC stop Arbitrary Billing”, “Stop load rejection”, “Provide metres to consumers” and “Stop operating without condition of service.” \nAddressing newsmen, their representative, Mr. Sampson Uneke, expressed dissatisfaction over alleged fraudulent services being rendered by EDDC. \nAnother protester called on the distribution company to provide consumers in the state with prepaid metres and upgrade its distribution infrastructure to improve electricity supply.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T10:51:15.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
