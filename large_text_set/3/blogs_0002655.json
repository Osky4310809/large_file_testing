Things happen, but I'm showing now that there's nothing to it. \n\"I'm playing and scoring goals, and that's the important thing. Everyone knows that anything I say has bigger repercussions than what it was. \n\"The manager is someone who works us really hard in training. He's got his personality just like I've got mine and others have theirs, but the important thing is to show your personality in a way that benefits the team. \n\"This is what's happening. Everyone is on the same page and that's the way we have to go.\" Diego Costa scored his 17th goal of the season in Chelsea's win at West Ham. \nCosta said the win at West Ham had revealed the difference in playing the East London side since their move to the London Stadium from Upton Park at the start of this season. \nThe Spain international added: \"They were always a difficult team to play in their old ground. \n\"It was always a tough game. When they come to a bigger pitch, with the crowd further from the players, maybe they don't feel the same heat from the crowd. \n\"For us or other teams that come here it's almost like coming to a neutral ground, because no one's used to be playing here. It's more equal.\" \nChelsea's victory restored their 10-point lead at the top of the Premier League with 11 matches remaining, but Costa was adamant that there would be no complacency. \n\"We can't go onto the pitch with the mindset of thinking we're champions already, that we have the title wrapped up,\" he said. \n\"There's still a long way to go. We do have a good advantage but we have to keep doing what we're doing. We just have to try and keep winning and take it one step at a time.\" \nLiam is ESPN FC's Chelsea correspondent.
