This regulation states that “contacting Academy members by telephone to promote a film or achievement is expressly forbidden, even if such contact is in the guise of checking to make sure a screener or other mailing was received.” \nAlthough Russell remains winless after 17 sound nominations, Sunday’s awards did put an Oscar in the hands of another long-time nominee who had never won before. \n“I can’t even tell you the experience it was for me,” said sound mixer Kevin O’Connell , who was one of the four men honored for their work on Hacksaw Ridge and who had been nominated 20 times without winning. “As much as I thought I knew what it would feel like [to win], I didn’t. It was the greatest feeling in my entire life.” Advertisement - story continues below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:08:14.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
