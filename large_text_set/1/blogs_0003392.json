If something happens down there, is the City of Pittsburgh responsible? We’re not. Are we paying any of the bill, we are not,” Councilman Corey O’Connor said. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \nGillman weighed in on the concerns, too. \n“It’s concerning to send officers to another city, under someone else’s command, into a situation that at least has the potential to be a hotbed of confrontation,” said Gilman. \nPittsburgh City Council says the move represents an opportunity for the city to contribute to a large event, and one day, we might find ourselves – like when the G20 Summit came to town – in need of having the favor returned. \nO’Connor says it is like an investment. \n“As you know, there has been talk about us hosting bigger events, hosting a convention, or a possible Super Bowl. We’re going to need other partners in other cities to help us as well,” O’Connor said.
