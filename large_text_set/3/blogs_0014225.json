With an emotional Senior Day and one big victory after another, one dominant performance followed by another one.\nFor so long, though, it didn’t seem possible.\nHis career at Rhode Island started with a lot of losing, and the tail end of it was besieged by one hard-luck injury after another, a badly sprained ankle then a stress fracture in his knee. The last one, a torn quad in early December of his senior year, finally made the Staten Island native question if that fairy-tale ending was still possible.\n“Who wouldn’t after everything that happened?” the 6-foot-7 shot-blocking dynamo said in a phone interview this week, as 11th-seeded Rhode Island prepared to face No. 6 Creighton in an NCAA Tournament South Region first-round game in Sacramento, Calif., the Rams’ first trip to the dance since 1999, when another New Yorker, Lamar Odom, led them there.\nYet, whenever those doubts crept it, Martin knocked on his coach’s door, and left believing everything was still possible.\n“He wore our trainers out doing anything he could to get back on the court,” Rhode Island assistant Jimmy Carr said.\nMartin listened because Danny Hurley had never steered him wrong before. He was the first coach to see this potential in him, back early in his high-school career at Curtis, when Hurley was coaching Wagner College and Martin had just quit football, putting everything into basketball. The bond started then.\nMartin and Danny Hurley after the A-10 title. Getty Images The summer after his junior year, following his first year on the AAU circuit, Martin was beginning to blow up. Had he waited, power-conference schools would have come pounding on his door. But Martin, one of seven siblings raised by his mother, Sharice, a former corrections officer at New York’s famed Rikers Island, and father Kareem Sr., didn’t need to feed his ego.\nHurley sat him down in his office and told him everything they could accomplish together — turning Rhode Island from an Atlantic 10 doormat into an NCAA Tournament team, developing Martin into one of the best forwards in the conference, setting him up for the future, on and off the court. Hurley painted him a picture four years down the road. He could create a legacy in Kingston, instead of merely helping a basketball powerhouse to further success. Four years later, they achieved it together.\n“To put Rhode Island on the map again, it’s just crazy,” said Martin, a 3.0 student majoring in communications. “All the hard work from the past four years is all showing up now.”\n“He’s really like a generational player for us,” Carr said. “He put a huge stamp on this program.”\nChris Alesi, Martin’s AAU coach who has known Hurley for years, saw the connection immediately. Two egoless and relentless workers, two like-minded individuals. Hurley never balked at Rhode Island even as Rutgers came calling twice. Martin never considered leaving during difficult times. Martin described his coach as a “parental figure,” he was there for him so frequently, and Hurley got choked up when taking about what it means to get to the tournament Martin’s final year.

It’s a special bond and a great story.”\nMartin became one of the nation’s premier shot-blockers the past two years — his 2.56 rejections per game this season was 14th in the nation — winning back-to-back A-10 Defensive Player of the Year honors, and made the conference’s second team this year despite missing five games and being physically limited for many more. He developed more than just a back-to-the-basket game on the offensive end, comfortable now shooting from the perimeter. Martin, the backbone to Rhode Island’s trademark pressure defense, will have a chance to play at the next level because of his defensive prowess and could be a second-round pick, one NBA scout said.\n\nWhen it mattered most, when his legacy was on the line, when his only shot at an NCAA Tournament looked bleak, he played the best basketball of his career. Over his past 17 games — 14 Rhode Island victories — Martin averaged 14.5 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocked shots. In arguably the two biggest regular-season wins of the year — the two biggest in years in Kingston — over Davidson and VCU, he tallied 19 points and 17.5 rebounds, owning the paint, willing the Rams to victories that made this run possible.\n“He needed to play an NCAA Tournament for me to feel whole, for the program to feel whole,” Hurley said. “We couldn’t let him walk out the door, walk across that graduation stage — a guy of his character, a guy of his greatness — [without it].\n“He would’ve been the [Atlantic 10] Player of the Year if he didn’t get hurt, but I’m sure he’ll take the consolation prize, which is a chance to be a part of March Madness.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T03:41:43.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
