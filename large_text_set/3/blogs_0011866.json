Nigerian Police \nAkeredolu had intervened by meeting separately with the two factions emphasising the need for genuine reconciliation. \nInformation reportedly filtered to the other 13 lawmakers led by the Speaker Jumoke Akindele and they also mobilized to storm the chambers. \nSecurity report of a possible break down of law and order reached the governor who directed the Police commissioner, Hilda Harrison, to foil the attempt and beef up security at the assembly. \nUnknown to the Malachi faction, on getting to the assembly, they reportedly met police resistance. \nMeanwhile, the Akindele faction has withdrawn its case challenging her sack, from High Court, Akure, as part of the reconciliation move by the governor.
