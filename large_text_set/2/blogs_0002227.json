The model first appeared in SI in 2010, wearing a striking blue bikini while sitting in the Maldivian sand. That year Teigen earned the Swimsuit Issue’s “Rookie of the Year” honors and immediately became an integral part of each subsequent edition, eventually gracing the 50th anniversary cover in 2014 alongside Nina Agdal and Lily Aldridge. She even appeared in the 2016 Issue while pregnant—and this year, after giving birth to daughter Luna last April, Teigen is back showing off her incredible post-baby body. That’s her 2017 shoot in the photo above. \n“It’s been a while since I’ve done anything swimsuit,” Teigen said in a clip previewing the Swimsuit Issue that’s airing on DIRECTV NOW. “I haven’t shot since baby. But of course you know that [SI Swimsuit editor] MJ [Day] and everyone at Sports Illustrated in general is going to embrace your body no matter what’s happening, and embrace the changes.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:36:42.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
