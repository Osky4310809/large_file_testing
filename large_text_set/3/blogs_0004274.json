Ho was required to train his replacement as a condition of getting his severance pay.\nFurther Reading Trump may soon sign executive order revamping H-1B visa program In its statement on the matter, UCSF says that it was pushed to hire outside contractors due to \"increased demand for information technology and escalating costs for these services.\" The university says it will save more than $30 million by hiring HCL, after seeing IT costs nearly triple between 2011 and 2016, \"driven by the introduction of the electronic medical record and increased digital connectivity.\"\nThe university says 49 UCSF employees were laid off, and it will eliminate another 48 jobs that are currently vacant or filled by contractors. \"UCSF will not replace UCSF IT employees with H-1B visa holders, nor will HCL,\" the university wrote in a statement e-mailed to Ars.\nOf the 49 laid off UCSF employees, 34 have either secured other employment or are retiring, the university said.\nThe university's decision to hire HCL has been controversial for months, and has drawn fire from politicians. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), who has submitted a bill meant to curb abuses of the H-1B program, sent a letter to UC President Janet Napolitano in November asking her to reverse its plan to outsource IT staff. Senator Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) sent a similar letter , reminding Napolitano that the UC system gets about $8.5 billion in federal support. House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), whose district encompasses most of San Francisco including UCSF, also asked the UC President reverse herself later in the month.\nThat led to some changes in UCSF's plan. According to a January story in the Los Angeles Times , the university told Feinstein's office that of the 27 HCL employees assigned to UCSF during the transition, eight had H-1B visas. The university assured her office that all the H-1B visa holders were moved elsewhere and won't be working at UCSF after all.\nAnother laid-off UCSF IT worker. IDG News Ho, who earns about $100,000, told the LA Times that he spent two days training his replacement in a process that UCSF called \"knowledge transfer.\"\n\"He told me he would go back to India and train his team, and would be sending me e-mails with questions,\" Ho said.\nAudrey Hatten-Milholin, who earned $127,000 at her job, says other replacements were around for two weeks. \"What was shocking is that the system is so complex there’s no way you can learn it in two weeks,\" she said.\nThirteen of the workers are considering filing a lawsuit, saying the way they were fired amounts to discrimination, Computerworld reported.\nThere have been reports that the Trump Administration is considering changes to the H-1B visa program , and there are at least two bills pending in Congress asking for reforms to the H-1B system, which is meant to allow for hiring of high-skilled employees from abroad. No movement has happened on those proposals yet, however.\n\"There’s talk about fixing things, and no [one] has done it yet,” laid-off worker Bizhan Tabatabaian told Computerworld. \"And I’m the proof.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T16:11:55.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
