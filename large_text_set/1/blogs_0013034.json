The honor was apparently a surprise to Biden, who broke into tears when the award was announced. From CNN :\nPresident Barack Obama surprised an emotional Vice President Joe Biden Thursday by presenting him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, during a White House ceremony.\n“For your faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of country and for your lifetime of service that will endure through the generations, I’d like to ask the military aide to join us on stage,” Obama said in the ceremony. “For my final time as President, I am pleased to award our nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.” When Obama mentioned the Medal of Freedom Biden did appear surprised. He turned away from the audience and wiped tears from his eyes. Biden struggled to keep his emotions in check throughout the rest of the ceremony. After being given the medal Biden stepped up to the podium and said, “Ricchetti, you’re fired.” Steve Ricchetti is Biden’s Chief of Staff who apparently helped the President mislead the VP about the purpose of the meeting. “I had no inkling,” Biden added. Biden went on to say, “This honor is not only well beyond what I deserve, but it’s a reflection of the extent and generosity of your spirit The full event was about 40 minutes long. You can watch it here if you’re so inclined.
