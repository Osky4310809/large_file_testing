The CGI was engulfed in these condemnations, with critics saying that wealthy foreign donors could influence Hillary Clinton and the government through their contributions. \nClinton’s team argued that the Foundation contributed to a variety of international charity projects, though it remained a subject of criticism throughout the election. \nAccording to The Daily Caller , it was announced back in September that the CGI would start laying off a number of staffers. Separately, the New York Observer reported that the CGI has seen a decrease in foreign donations while suggesting that contributors were more interested in Clinton access than charity. \nIt is worth noting that the Observer is owned by Jared Kushner , who is both son-in-law and upcoming senior adviser to President-Elect Donald Trump . \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T17:37:31.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
