Robert Harward said thanks, but no thanks to becoming President Donald Trump's next national security adviser , the administration is still mulling over a list of four. \nAmong the contenders: the current acting national security adviser, retired Army Gen. Keith Kellogg. \nTrump tweeted Friday morning that Kellogg, \"who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA — as are three others.\" General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \nThe president didn't name the other three, but at least one candidate being floated is former CIA Director David Petraeus, senior administration officials told NBC News. \nTrump in November tweeted that he was \"very impressed\" by Petraeus after meeting with him. But the retired four-star general would be a potentially explosive choice after a scandal in which he pleaded guilty in 2015 to mishandling classified information. \nTrump is in need of a new adviser after retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn resigned Monday over phone calls with Russia's ambassador to the United States. \nWhomever he taps will be a key confidant on sensitive security issues.
