Showcase products \nWhether you choose to show off several different products or highlight features of a single product, the albums format is a great way to tell people about what you offer. 2. Tell a story \nIf a picture’s worth a thousand words, then what are 10 photos and videos worth? So. Much. More. \nAlbums give brands the opportunity to explore new creative avenues for storytelling, breaking stories down into multiple parts to make them even more engaging for the audience. 3. Explain how to do something \nThe ability to easily pull together multiple elements into one single posts makes albums the perfect place to share a how-to. Write instructions on individual photos, have someone explain what’s happening in a video—the sky’s the limit. 4. Break a larger image into multiple parts \nLots of brands have happily embraced the #triplegram—a tactic that involves posting three related images, or one image cropped into three, in succession. With albums, this process is even easier. \nCrop a panorama into several pieces to show off details. Then, get creative with other functionality, like zoom , to engage your audience. 5. Share an event without spamming \nHave you ever held an event and wanted to share, well, everything? But Instagram etiquette—and the desire not to spam your followers—kept you to an agonizingly chosen one or two images? No more. \nNow you can carefully curate the best of the best photos or videos from an event and share them in a grouping that gives them added context—and prevents your audience from hitting the unfollow button.

Image via Instagram Blog . \nWhile you have the ability to edit the caption or location of your album, you cannot reorder, edit, or delete parts of your post or change accounts you’ve tagged.
