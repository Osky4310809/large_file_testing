Each team plays a home and away with its three division opponents.\nThere are four games against teams in another division within the same conference, on a three-year rotating cycle.\nThe league schedules four games from a division in the other conference, on a four-year rotating cycle.\nThere are two intraconference games based on the previous season’s standings. These games match a first-place team against the first-place teams in the two same-conference divisions that the team is not scheduled to play that season. The second-place, third-place, and fourth-place teams in a conference are matched in the same way each year.\nHere are the Broncos’ home and away games.
