But now that the 22-year-old rapper has found fame, and love, what else does he want?\nIn a new interview with The FADER , the burgeoning Philly-born artist dishes on what it’s like being a rapper, being forced to provide for his family, leaving Philadelphia for Atlanta, and his relationship with Brittany Byrd .\nBelow we have provided some key excerpts from Uzi’s conversation with The FADER , as you can then follow on over to their website for the entire interview.\nOn dedicating himself to music by getting a face tattoo: \n“I had a job for fucking four days. I couldn’t do it. I’m not normal. I was in there just thinking, Why am I doing this? It was like, If I get this face tattoo, I got to focus. I can’t go in nobody’s office with a suit on with this shit on my face. I got to focus on what I want to do.”\nOn leaving Philadelphia for Atlanta: \n“I really realize, the world is bigger than motherfuckers that’s around you. The world is bigger than that neighborhood, bro. That’s what I realized. I said, ‘Hold on, if y’all do this, y’all keep doing this, right? Y’all keep doing the same thing, your whole lifestyle: eating the same, thinking the same, doing the same activities, doing it everyday. It becomes a cycle. If it becomes a cycle, what are you learning now? Nothing.’”\nOn the obligation of being a working artist: \n“You wanna know what the curse is? I gotta take care of my family. That’s the curse right there. I gotta take care of my whole family. That’s why I can’t stop. If I ain’t have to take care of nobody, best believe I’d be regular as fuck.”\nOn his public relationship with Brittany Byrd: \n“I’m a rapper, bro. It’s fucked up. Our relationship is fucked up. But, you know, I love her for her and she loves me for me. So, you know. It’s always gon be good.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:59:22.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
