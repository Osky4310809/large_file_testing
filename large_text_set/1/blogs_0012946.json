He loved the company culture, but the work wasn't a fit. As he searched for something more fulfilling to do, he noticed that the major business magazines, of which he was a fan, were difficult for him to relate to. His life wasn't like the lives of the people on a Forbes billionaire list.\n\nNathan started his magazine with about $3,000 and a goal of filling the gap between major business magazine content and entrepreneurs like himself. He wanted to speak to aspiring young entrepreneurs (he was 26 years old at the time) and provide in-depth content about what it takes to build a successful business.\n\nNathan says that podcasts inspired this vision for his magazine, too. Podcasts were becoming increasingly popular, featured stories about relatable people, and could cover a topic in depth.\n\n\n\nFour months into producing the magazine, Nathan and his startup magazine faced a major roadblock. A large business magazine sued Nathan's startup magazine for trademark infringement. Luckily, Nathan says, the rebranding of the magazine resulted in the name Foundr, which is a better fit.\n\nListen to the show to learn more about how Nathan responded to the lawsuit by improving the magazine's branding.\n\nThe Business Model\n\nFoundr has three main sources of revenue: magazine subscriptions, the membership site, and courses. The magazine subscription is $2.99/month or $21.99/year and is available through the iTunes and Google Play stores. Across monthly and yearly subscriptions, Foundr has 20,000 monthly readers.\n\nOn the Foundr membership site, subscribers have access to premium content, an online community, and exclusive training. In addition to the main revenue sources, Foundr includes a bit of sponsorship and advertising.\n\nListen to the show to discover the similarities between what Nathan and I do.\n\nNathan's Interviewing Process\n\nNathan has interviewed successful entrepreneurs including Richard Branson, founder of Virgin; Steve Case, founder of AOL; Arianna Huffington, founder of Huffington Post; Gary Vaynerchuk; Barbara Corcoran; Tim Ferriss; Robert Herjavec; Jessica Livingston, founder of Y Combinator; and others.\n\nMuch of Nathan's interview preparation involves his day-to-day reading about and listening to the topics, brands, and people Foundr covers.
