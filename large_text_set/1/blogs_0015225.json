The game will come to Google Play on Feb. 2 and later for iOS devices. Players will “call upon Fire Emblem heroes throughout history,” including characters from Fire Emblem Awakening and Fire Emblem Fates , in turn-based battles. Those battles will take place on an 8x6 grid designed to fit on smartphones, Nintendo said.
