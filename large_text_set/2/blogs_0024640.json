That may be the issue at stake in a recent Arkansas murder trial. \nAmazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) is pleading First Amendment rights for its automated speaker Alexa in the trial. Prosecutors have requested that the court order Amazon to hand over recordings made by an Echo Dot, a miniature version of the company's smart speaker, in a 48-hour period during which the murder was committed. Even when it is not processing commands, Amazon's speaker constantly records surrounding sounds to listen for its trigger word, Alexa. However, Amazon is resisting the order. (See also: Alexa, Who Won CES This Year? ) \nThe company argues that there are \"important First Amendment and privacy implications\" at stake in the case. According to Amazon's filing, requests made by a user to the company's home assistant reveal information about his or her personality and interests. Handing over these data to federal officials would be tantamount to Amazon violating customer privacy. Furthermore, user requests are free speech and are protected under the First Amendment. In the same vein, Alexa's responses may also reveal user interests and are reflective of Amazon's speech. Hence, they should also be protected under the First Amendment.

(See also: Integrating Phone Calls Into Smart Speakers .) \nA law professor interviewed by Forbes said Amazon's case was \"surprisingly plausible.\" In a paper that she co-authored, the professor wrote that the law for cases involving robot free speech \"hinges more on pragmatism and on expression's informational value than on any philosophical purity about speaker personhood or rights.\" In addition, Alexa can be categorized as an embodiment of Amazon. But the professor also told Forbes that just because something is covered under the First Amendment does not guarantee that it is protected.
