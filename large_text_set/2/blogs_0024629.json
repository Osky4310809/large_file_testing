But that still won’t be enough.\nThe Celtics and Pacers are engaging in early dialogue on a possible Paul George trade, and Boston seems willing to include the swap rights on the Nets ’ 2017 first-round pick in the package, according to Yahoo! Sports’ Adrian Wojnarowski . However, the Pacers are still asking for more.\nThe Celtics are also embroiled in a similar staring match with talks involving Chicago All-Star Jimmy Butler , though the sticking point in that deal reportedly is Jae Crowder . As always, it’s unclear if the Bulls and Pacers are even seriously putting their stars on the table or if they are just soliciting offers without any intention of moving them.\nBoston has a treasure trove of assets to include in any deal for a superstar, but it’s unclear if they’ll throw any of their prized future first-round picks onto the table. The Nets currently have the league’s worst record, so there’s a 25 percent chance that 2017 pick will be No. 1 overall. Boston also has Brooklyn’s 2018 first-round pick outright, as well as future draft picks from the Grizzlies and Clippers . \nPlus, Boston has a number of solid rotation players to include in the deal (Crowder, Avery Bradley , Marcus Smart ) and a couple expiring contracts to make the money work ( Amir Johnson and Tyler Zeller ). Will that be enough to actually get a deal done? Time will tell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:36:47.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
