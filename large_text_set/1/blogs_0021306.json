DONALD TRUMP: Ultimately it [payment for the wall] will come out of what is happening with Mexico. We are going to be starting those negotiations relatively soon, and we will be paid back, in a form, reimbursed by Mexico. DAVID MUIR: So they'll pay us back? TRUMP: Yes. Absolutely. 100%. MUIR: So the American taxpayer will pay for the wall, at first. TRUMP: All it is, is we will be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico. MUIR: Mexico's president said in recent days that Mexico absolutely will not pay, adding that it goes against our dignity as a country, \"our dignity as Mexicans.\" TRUMP: He has to say that. I'm just telling you, there will be a payment, it will be in a form. Perhaps a complicated form... We want to have a very stable, very solid Mexico. MUIR: When does construction begin? TRUMP: Very soon, as soon as we can physically do it. MUIR: Months? TRUMP: I would say in months, planning is starting immediately.
