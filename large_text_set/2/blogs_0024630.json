Opening Hours \n9am until sunset (around 5.30 p.m.). The Ajanta caves are closed on Mondays, and the Ellora caves are closed on Tuesdays. Both caves are open on national holidays. However, try to avoid visiting them then (as well as on weekends) as the crowds can be overwhelming and you won't have a peaceful experience. Entrance Fees and Charges \nVisiting both the Ajanta and Ellora caves is costly for foreigners. The sites require separate tickets and the price has been increased to 500 rupees per ticket, effective from April 2016. Indians pay only 30 rupees per ticket at each site. Children younger than 15 years are free at both places. Where to Stay \nHotel Kailas ( read reviews ) is located right opposite the Ellora caves. It's a relaxing, tranquil place with stone walls and a scenic landscape, albeit simply furnished accommodations. Rates are 2,000 rupees for a non air-conditioned room, 3,000 rupees for an air-conditioned cottage, and 3,500 rupees for an air-conditioned cottage facing the caves. The hotel has plenty of amenities for guests including a restaurant, internet access, a library and games. You can also go paragliding. \nQuality accommodations at Ajanta are limited so if you need to stay in the area, it's best to head to the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation's Ajanta T Junction Guest House (2,000 rupees per night) or Ajanta Tourist Resort in nearby Fardapur (1,700 rupees per night). \nIf you prefer to stay in Aurangabad, check out these current special hotel deals on Tripadvisor. Travel Tips \nThe most incredible thing about the caves is that they were crafted by hand, with only a hammer and chisel. While the Ajanta caves are rich in paintings and sculpture, the Ellora caves are renowned for their extraordinary architecture. You can get an excellent view and perspective of inside the Kailasa temple by climbing up the hill around it. Its immense size covers twice the area of the Pantheon in Athens and is one and a half times as high! Bring a torch with you to the caves as many of them are quite dark and lighting is poor. \nTry to reach the caves before 11 a.m. to beat the crowds. Most tour buses don't arrive until noon. Should You Visit Ajanta or Ellora? \nDon't have time or money to visit both caves? Ellora receives about three times as many tourists as Ajanta, as it's more accessible. If your itinerary forces you to choose, the architecture at Ellora is more impressive. However, Ajanta has an outstanding setting overlooking a gorge and is more enjoyable to explore. The Japanese government funds the maintenance of the Buddhist Ajanta caves, so they're in noticeably better condition than sadly neglected Ellora. This definitely makes Ajanta more appealing. Dangers and Annoyances \nThe Ellora caves are particularly popular with domestic tourists, and facilities are inadequate to cope with the droves that descend there on weekends and public holidays. The car park gets extremely congested and garbage is also a problem. Females should note that sexual harassment from groups of young Indian guys has become quite prevalent at Ellora in recent years, although measures (including the deployment of special police safety squads) have been taken to remedy this. Nevertheless, anyone with white skin is likely to be pestered to pose for \"one photo\", which becomes annoying. Hawkers and touts commonly overcharge foreign tourists and are to be avoided. Festivals \nA three-day Ellora Ajanta International Festival , organized by the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, will be held at the Ellora caves and in Aurangabad from October 14-16, 2016. It features some of India's most distinguished musicians and and dancers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:48.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
