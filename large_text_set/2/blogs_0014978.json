You look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden, they took in large numbers, they are having problems like they never thought possible,\" Trump said at the rally.\n\"You look at what's happening Brussels, you look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice, take a look at Paris,\" he continued.\n\nThe allegation sent pundits and political observers scrambling to find evidence of any such incident in Sweden â€” and they came up empty. Swedish foreign ministry spokeswoman Catarina Axelsson said her office contacted the US state department for clarification. Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt even chimed in, mocking Trump's dubious claim on Twitter.\n\"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound,\" Bildt said .\nSEE ALSO: Trump's defense chief says has no problems with media \nThe FOX News segment Trump was referring to was an interview between host Tucker Carlson and documentarian and media personality Ami Horowitz that aired Friday night. Horowitz presented a clip from a film documenting alleged violence committed by refugees in Sweden, and the segment went on extensively about an alleged crime surge in Sweden and its links to immigrants.\nIn fact, a 2016 crime survey found crime rates in Sweden have stayed relatively stable over the past decade.\nThe president's comments drew immediate comparisons to a gaffe committed earlier this month by Trump surrogate Kellyanne Conway, who referenced the fictional \"Bowling Green Massacre\" as justification for Trump's controversial immigration order in interviews with multiple media outlets .\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer similarly blundered this month when he referred multiple times to a terrorist attack in Atlanta that never happened. Spicer later said he \"clearly meant Orlando,\" the site of a mass nightclub shooting in June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:44:03.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
