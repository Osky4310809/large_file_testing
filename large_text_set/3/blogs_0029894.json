After consulting with his video assistant, however, referee Felix Zwayer waved the goal off after replays showed Kurzawa had drifted behind the Spain defence. \nWith Spain up 1-0 in the 77th minute, Gerard Deulofeu scored for La Roja off a low Jordi Alba cross. The goal was initially waved off by the linesman for offside but following a brief review, the Milan attacker's strike was correctly given. \nMessi given four-match ban \nThe match at the Stade de France was part of a replay trial that was approved prior to the encounter by the French and Spanish associations, as well as by Fifa president Gianni Infantino. \nReferees were given four main areas to focus on for video replays: deciding on whether or not a goal should count, penalty decisions, direct red cards, and correcting the identity of a penalised player. \nReplay officials were stationed in a van parked outside the stadium. Based on the outcome Tuesday, there will very likely be more matches decided in this fashion moving forward.
