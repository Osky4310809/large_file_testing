Unfortunately, he’s earned the titles of “irrational” and “volatile” as he once again leads the league in technical fouls, now just one away from receiving his second suspension of the 2016-2017 campaign for going over the NBA’s season limit of 16. \nHowever, Cousins’ reputations does not define him as a player (or as a human for that matter). Whether it’s the millions of dollars he’s donated to charities without parading the act as a publicity stunt, or his relentless involvement within the Sacramento community throughout his tenure with the franchise, Cousins is more than the hothead he may appear on the court.
