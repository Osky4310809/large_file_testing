He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come,\" Apple’s current CEO, Tim Cook, said in the press release. \"The workspaces and parklands are designed to inspire our team as well as benefit the environment. We’ve achieved one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world and the campus will run entirely on renewable energy.\"\nThe Steve Jobs Theater on Apple Park's campus.\nImage: apple\nThe Steve Jobs Theater, a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder complete with a metallic carbon-fiber roof, will seat up to 1,000 and honor the business leader's \"memory and his enduring influence on Apple and the world.\"\n\"Steve was exhilarated, and inspired, by the California landscape, by its light and its expansiveness. It was his favorite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well,\" added Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs' widow. \"He would have flourished, as the people of Apple surely will, on this luminously designed campus.”\nThough the campus will officially open in April, it's expected to take more than six months to move the 12,000+ employees onto the campus and get them situated in the 2.8 million-square-foot main building.\nDuring that time, construction of the buildings and surrounding parklands will continue. By the time it's complete, it will include a visitors center featuring an Apple Store and cafe open to the public, a massive fitness center for employees and more.\nRead more about the details of Apple's new campus by revisiting our first look at construction in 2016 .\nBONUS: Steve Jobs White House ad", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VJOBAfo5gWCZPit4t5HE_9ULu6U=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F391370%2F9d83e669-7e59-4660-a1c7-1fd548e78dca.jpg", "https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/02/apple-park-opens-to-employees-in-april.html", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/f2nyTRPC.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DJmxZnhp5yU59Dp_JYb09syE8r4=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F391377%2F0b208b73-fab5-40cf-a899-746d56c077ba.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BRVAl0kgmZDazeVm5PWnANLGexI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F391370%2F9d83e669-7e59-4660-a1c7-1fd548e78dca.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TB7k-8hE8HyGqPLli--oB7TgzrI=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F391377%2F0b208b73-fab5-40cf-a899-746d56c077ba.jpg", "http://www.apple.com/newsroom/embed/videos/?embedvideoid=1487723199912", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/f2nyTRPC.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-22T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:34:35.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
