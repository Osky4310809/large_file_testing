Theresa Maycan't hide her mirth (Photo: Reuters) \nMr Hammond didn’t mention Brexit once and there was no talk of handing the £350million a week saved by leaving the EU to the NHS. \nHe stumped up just £2.4billion over three years to ease the crisis in social care – dismissed as a drop in the ocean by campaigners. \nThe Chancellor announced his raid on self-employed taxes will help pay for the Tories’ beloved free schools programme. Many will be selective, making them grammar schools. The Tory pledge (Photo: Conservatives) \nMr Hammond hiked up the price of beer, cider wines and spirits – the first time in 25 years all booze has risen in a Budget. That will hurt public sector workers as he refused to lift their 1% pay rise cap. \nAnd the Office for Budget Responsibility warned the party is to fall short on its pledge to raise the national minimum wage to £9 an hour by 2020. There was nothing to help Theresa May’s “Just About Managing ­families”. \nAnd with inflation forecast to hit 2.4% this year, ­households will struggle further. Philip Hammond with his Budget red box (Photo: Getty) \nEnd Child Poverty branded the Budget “disappointing”. Chair Sam Royston said: “Instead of using it to help disadvantaged families, the Chancellor has left them out in the cold.” \nDespite Tory claims the economy is thriving, experts warned Britain’s £1.7trillion debt could soar – ­shattering another manifesto pledge to bring it under control by 2025. \nThere was better news for small businesses as Mr Hammond offered measures to combat the rates rises which had been set to clobber many firms.
