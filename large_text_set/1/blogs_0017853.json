They suspect Hernandez saw the opening, and walked right in. \nShortly after 10:00 p.m, he pushed his way inside, locked the door behind him and told Blanchette he was “hiding from police,” sources said. \nPolice say he struck her in the face with a vase and smashed a mirror over her head, slashing her with the broken glass. A neighbor on the floor below heard the commotion and called 911. \n“For the fact this neighbor stepped up to the plate, could have saved this lady’s life and probably did,” neighbor Debbie Stevens told CBS2’s Dave Carlin. \nWhen police arrived, they say they found the suspect still beating the 70-year-old woman. \nBlanchette’s neighbor tells 1010 WINS’ Roger Stern that he saw responding officers break down the victim’s door. \n“I just saw them open the door, kicking the door,” he said. \nPolice say an officer applied a “quick-clot” medicated rag to the woman’s head and neck, potentially saving her life. She was taken to Lutheran Medical Center where she received 30 stitches and is currently stable. \nSources tell CBS2 police used a taser to subdue Hernandez. \nHe was taken into custody at the scene and has been charged with assault and burglary, according to sources. He admitted he was in the building, but denied the assault. \nBlanchette, a native of Sweden, has lived in the apartment for decades. Neighbors said in days gone by many tenants left their front doors open, but added that no one should be that trusting anymore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T05:13:08.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
