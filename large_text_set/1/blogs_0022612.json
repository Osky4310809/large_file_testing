Rodrigo Caio, though, lunges in ahead of Torres and kills the move dead. Good defending again, but Brazil need to keep the ball better when they go forward or they will be punished eventually. 21' CHALLENGE! Unbelievable play all round! Torres threads a stunning pass in behind for Gutierrez, leaving Rodrigo Caio completely lost. However, if the defender was caught napping by the original delivery, he recovered well, snapping at the forward's heels to snuff out the opportunity. 20' The game has just settled down again after that flurry of attacking intent. Colombia are keeping the ball from their hosts rather well at present. 18' A few jeers for Borja as he goes down on the edge of the Brazil area. The referee is not impressed, and neither are the home supporters. 16' Colombia are more methodical in their approach, with Macnelly Torres and Teofilo Gutierrez combining nicely while lacking the punch of their opposite numbers. 14' CHANCE! Lucas Lima and Robinho are linking up beautifully. The former tees up the latter to cross, with the ball finally dropping for Willian Arao. Falling onto his left, though, the Brazil midfielder cannot keep his shot down. 11' CHALLENGE! Superb defending to keep Dudu at bay. Lucas Lima's bite in the tackle and fine, threaded pass had set Diego Souza away, and he in turn slipped in his fellow forward. Just as Dudu was lining up the shot, though, William Tesillo came storming back to get something on the ball. 9' After Brazil's early manipulation of the ball, it now appears they are the side looking to counter on Colombia's carefully constructed attacks. Robinho has led a yellow charge on a couple of occasions already. 7' SAVE! There's the first opening! Robinho and Lucas Lima swap passes in fine style, but the move swiftly comes to an end with Willian Arao's slack pass and Colombia break. Miguel Borja runs in behind and drags a finish towards the corner, with Weverton just getting something on the shot to turn it around the post. Close. 6' A first ball into the box, from Colombia and Daniel Bocanegra, is easily dealt with. Brazil come again, but Fagner is offside on the right. Both sides look happy to slowly settle into this game. 4' It's a slow start so far, here. The hosts are happy to keep the ball, with Walace and Lucas Lima getting plenty of touches in the middle of the field. 2' Brazil quickly win the ball and build in possession, but the forward pass from debutant Fagner is easily picked up by a Colombian defender. 1' KICK-OFF: The visitors get us under way! An emotional rendition of the Brazilian national anthem brings the pre-match preparations to an end, and, after a minute's applause, we'll be ready for the off... And here come the players! Robinho leads out the hosts in their famous yellow shirts, while Colombia adorn a change blue strip. As the players prepare, there have been a number of presentations taking place on the pitch, with Chapecoense's crest displayed in the middle of the field and the survivors of the tragic crash in attendance. Colombia: Gonzalez, Bocanegra, Felipe Aguilar, Tesillo, Diaz, Torres, Abel Aguilar, Uribe, Copete, Gutierrez, Borja. Brazil: Weverton, Fagner, Geromel, Rodrigo Caio, Fabio Santos, Willian Arao, Walace, Lucas Lima, Robinho, Diego Souza, Dudu. With the fixture falling outside of FIFA's international window - and the European leagues in full swing - only South American-based players have been called upon for this one. This match has been organised to raise funds for Chapecoense, the Brazilian club who had players, backroom staff and directors among the 71 people to tragically lose their lives in a plane crash in November. The team had been travelling to face Colombia's Atletico Nacional in the Copa Sudamericana final.
