Senator Chuck Schumer .\nThe president tweeted on Tuesday morning (January 31) at 6:21am that “Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!”\nAmy took to Instagram to defend her cousin for being a “genuine” person while slamming Trump ‘s “awful” decisions.\nClick inside to read what Amy Schumer wrote in her post… \n“This is what he was thinking about at 621am. This was his tweet after his first soldier died. Also 8 Yemeni women and 7 children died and trump called the raid ‘successful,’” Amy wrote. “Also I know chuck Schumer and HE CANNOT act trust me. He can barely smile on cue. He can’t help but be transparent and genuine. He was hurt for those people and all the people facing such unconstitutional injustice.” \n“Trump is about to bombard us with so many awful decisions. His Supreme Court pick will be terrifying and he will try and stop same sex adoption and all our other nightmares,” she continued. “We can’t get burnt out or overwhelmed and distracted. We need to stay focused and organized. Tell your friends who say ‘I’m just not political’ that that doesn’t cut it anymore. We need people alert and fighting for each other’s rights.” \n“Tell your sheltered friends to wake up and help,” Amy added. “If you live somewhere where youve never even met a Muslim person and it feels like this doesn’t really affect you. It does. A Muslim ban is so unconstitutional and cruel. They are good, hard working people and a refugee from the countries he isn’t letting people in from have never committed any acts of terrorism on US soil. Never. We need to fight this now and together. Call congress. Call the senate. We need to wake up and rise up together. People need our help.”\nA photo posted by @amyschumer on Jan 31, 2017 at 8:04am PST \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:01:12.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
