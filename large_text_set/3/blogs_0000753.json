But it was my own decision.” \nThe 37-year-old, who brought the curtain down on his career in 2015 after a spell at Shamrock Rovers, has also revealed that he also had several opportunities to join Liverpool. \nHe added: “I came close [to joining Liverpool] two or three times. \n“The first was a year or two before I signed for Chelsea [in 2003]. I would have gone there, but Blackburn wanted a big fee so not too many clubs could afford to buy me back then! \n“Then when I was leaving Chelsea, the same move nearly happened again.” \nDuff retired having made well over 600 club appearances and with 100 caps for his country. He is now working as a first-team coach at Shamrock Rovers.
