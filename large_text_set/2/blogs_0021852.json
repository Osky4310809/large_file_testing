She’s delivered hits after hits over the years with Highway , Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania , Kapoor and Sons , and more recently, Dear Zindagi . While it’s only fair for her to attribute her success to her choices and her talent, a lot of people think otherwise. People have constantly accused her mentor, Karan Johar , of favouring her over every other heroine and of aggressively putting in a word for Alia to other filmmakers too. \nKangana Ranaut too, who was on Koffee With Karan last week, accused Karan of nepotism. While she didn’t blatantly any names, one would think of Alia Bhatt and Kareena Kapoor Khan – his two favourites. This isn’t the first time Alia has heard something like this. But, at a recent event, she was asked about the issue and here’s what she said. \nI think a star kid can get that first film due to nepotism. But to constantly get films just because you belong to a filmi family, is not possible. I don’t want to take any names, but there have been many examples of sons and daughters of lineage who have come and gone without achieving anything. What about that? Eventually, people come to see you as an actor and not because your family is famous, and you can’t fool them. Talking about her journey, she added. I am aware people do struggle to make a mark in the industry, but it’s not right to blame nepotism. I didn’t plan my birth in the Bhatt family. I can’t change that and today, I am successful not just because my family is famous, but also because I have worked hard and you can’t take it away from me. Damn straight, Alia! However she may have got her first film, you can’t deny that this 23 year old is filled with oodles of talent, which is out there for the world to see. Keep slayin’, you! 11", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:37:21.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
