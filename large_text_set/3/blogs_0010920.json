Compiled by The Runner's World Editors   7:00 pm At 85, Ed Whitlock sets another age-group world record, running 3:56:33 last October at the Toronto Marathon. Andrew McClanahan/Photo Run \nRunners across the globe expressed shock and sadness Monday at the death of Canadian masters champion Ed Whitlock , 86. He set his most recent record less than five months ago, when he ran 3:56:33 at the Toronto Marathon, taking more than 28 minutes off the previous record for men older than 85. \n  \nAs news of Whitlock’s death spread, athletes and others in the running community shared their memories with Runner’s World via phone and email and on social media. Alan Brookes, race director of the Toronto Waterfront Marathon \nEd and I went many miles together. One year we went to a Runner’s World presentation together in New York City. Ed was receiving an award. I remember Ed got up to speak—all 110 pounds of him—and in his typical modest style he said, “I don’t really know what to say. I don’t have a coach. I don’t have a manger or an agent. I don’t have any commercial endorsements. I don’t really have a training program. I just like to go out to run.” \nThe room erupted. Everyone loved this man who ran around a cemetery for three hours every day, who ran in 20-year-old running shoes and a 30-year-old running vest. \nHe was extremely modest and he was a little uncomfortable with so many people saying that he was their inspiration. He thought he was just a guy, just a guy who loved to run. \nEd for sure will be up there with Terry Fox as a Canadian running legend. When he was in his 70s, all the young bucks who were trying to break three hours in the marathon would gather around Ed during a race. You would have 25-year-olds trying to hang on with this granddad who had long white hair. Many couldn’t. A post shared by Sheila Reid (@shewolfruns) on Mar 13, 2017 at 2:45pm PDT \nPaul Gains, journalist and publicist for the Canada Running Series, which includes the Toronto Marathon \nThe last time I saw him was at a press conference after Toronto (in October). He had everyone in stitches talking about training in shoes that were 20 years old. \nHe never understood what the fuss was about with him breaking records. He was a very humble man, a lovely gentleman. \nIn the buildup to the Toronto marathon, he didn’t get full training in. At that time, he didn’t know whether he was going to run the half marathon or the marathon. He thought if he had he been able to train fully, he could have run about 3:40. \nHe was a very funny guy. He was always dressed in a suit and tie when he wasn’t running. All the elite athletes would be in their gear. He would show up, always well dressed, prim and proper. A celebration for him was opening up a bottle of wine and having a dinner of sole with his wife. \nHe was one of those guys you’d think would be here forever. He’ll be setting another record. When Alan [Brookes] told me the news, it was stunning. He just seemed to be someone who could go through anything. Eighty-six years old, that’s old. But he didn’t convey old age. \nYou’d see him at the race. There was always a crowd wanting to speak with him. He took time for everyone. There was never a matter of him being in a rush. \nAt the Toronto marathon, in 2011, I was sitting with the elite athletes, in a postrace room, and everyone is having snacks. A couple of the Kenyan runners are sitting there—Kenneth Mungara, Jafred Chirchir, Daniel Rono, and Nixon Machichim. I remember pointing Ed out to them. He had run 3:15:54. And they’re nodding. And they looking at me, why should they be impressed? When did he run 3:15? They’re thinking it was 60 years ago. I told them it was today. They start speaking in Swahili. One guy was lying on a cot. He sat up to take a better look. \nLanni Marchant, Canadian marathon record holder and Olympian \nI first heard of Ed when I was living in the U.S. and getting into longer distance running, probably around 2011. Some American masters men found out I was Canadian and asked me if I knew this man who was setting all the these records and running insanely fast times. I had no idea who they were talking about. \nThen I went to Toronto [in 2013] to run the marathon and that’s when I set the Canadian record. He also set a record that day [3:41:58 at age 82]. We both had these outstanding performances and I finally put a face to the name of this legend. He was so humble and awe-inspiring. He ran simply, just lap after lap after lap in the cemetery. \nAt a time when everybody makes so much out of technology or shoes that will break two hours and all of that, he just ran his laps and lined up to run his races. That’s what made him so good. When I get caught up in splits and workouts, I take a step back and remember it’s just running—it’s just one foot in front of the other, like Ed did. \nI’m shocked and a little stunned. His last marathon was just this fall and I was there to be a commentator. We made sure to have a camera on him the whole time. ‘Don’t limit yourself’ - Ed Whitlock, 2:54:49 marathon at age 73 #RIPEdWhitlock pic.twitter.com/SsQLjJLd5j \n— Athletics Canada (@AthleticsCanada) March 13, 2017 \nBen Kaplan, general manager of iRun , a Canadian running publication: Certain people you tend to gravitate towards—the ones that make you feel something, who offer something more. Ed had an unmistakable grace. So much of this culture is about the latest newfangled piece of gear and so much of it is about marketing, and he had something else—authenticity, soul, heart. I was just watching a video I made with him and he’s wearing a suit. Who wears a suit to a running expo? He’s smiling the whole time. He was a gentleman. He had this little house, he kept his clippings in a photo album. He got a kick out of seeing his running exploits reported. He kept his memorabilia. He had these leather cleats that he wore from the ’40s. The looked like they belonged in the Smithsonian. But he was approachable. I’ve probably been to his house four or five times. When you go to his house, he takes you to the cemetery, you do the jog. He was a frail-looking guy. I’d think there’s no way that this guy is in shape to run a marathon. In October he just did not look like a man who was going to run a marathon, but he did it. He had this no B.S. about him—he just trotted ahead and kept it simple. I just like that image of him in his suit at the race expo, this dignified old man who you did not suspect was the greatest runner in the room. He just refused to take himself too seriously. He didn’t even have a sneaker contract, you know? And God bless him, because everybody needs to make every dollar they can, especially in Canada where Olympians have day jobs. He wore 10-year-old sneakers and didn’t play that game. It’s come as a complete shock. Who runs the marathon at the end of October and is dead the beginning of March? He lived his life. He seemed happy and he seemed to enjoy his life. He seemed to be having the time of his life. He didn’t carry himself like the belle of the ball—he carried himself like he was happy to be invited to the party. Ed Whitlock in the cemetery where he did his training runs. K.C. Armstrong Wendell Lafave, co-race director of the Great Raisin River Footrace in Williamstown, Ontario \nHe had a tremendous character. He was humble and gracious. The running is certainly one great thing about Ed, but the personality of the man is another. \nWhen you watched Ed run it was a piece of beauty. I have watched a lot of runners–elite runners—and I have never seen the form, the style, or the kick of Ed. It was poetry. \nSheila Lafave, co-race director of the Great Raisin River Footrace in Williamstown, Ontario, via email A few years ago we were going to change the 11K to a 10K (took the river crossing out of the picture). Ed said he wanted us to keep the 11K because it was a unique distance, special to our race. As a result, the 11K is known as the Ed Whitlock 11K in his honour. He would help us out in any way he could, including setup of the race the day before, and we always enjoyed supper at the local pub afterwards. He loved his fish and chips. Bill Rodgers spoke highly of Ed and said how he marvelled at this lanky older fella with the flowing white hair going by him. He was a real admirer of him. Reid Coolsaet, two-time Olympic marathoner for Canada I first heard about Ed when he did the Scotia Bank Waterfront Marathon, before I was running marathons. When I started running them in 2009, we’d run into each other at the press conferences off and on for the next six years. He was always interested in what we were doing. He was a fan of elite sport and would keep up with our times, but at the same time what struck me with Ed was that he kept everything really simple. He just ran for time usually—his long runs were two hours or three hours and he didn’t have a GPS. He could have gotten sponsored, I’m guessing. He was quite popular. He just chose to stick with his old running gear and keep things simple. It was refreshing. And he always came to the press conferences dressed well, too. I’d be in my New Balance sweatshirt and jeans and he’d be in a suit and tie. He was really soft-spoken but always interested in what races we had coming up and stuff like that. He was supportive of other runners. A lot of people would ask him questions at the press conferences, other masters runners asking for advice. He took everything very lightly. He knew that he didn’t think about things too much and got away with running marathons late into his life. I’m guessing he had some genetic luck, but I also think the way he approached running carefree and simply allowed him to hit his goals and do things that other 70-year-olds and 80-year-olds weren’t doing. It was really refreshing how simple he kept things. It’s easy to get caught up in all the gadgets and splits and chasing sponsors and promoting stuff, but he just did what he wanted to do and stuck to it. Robert Moore, a longtime friend and fellow Canadian masters runner who wrote the following for Canadian Masters Athletics \nWhen we met at races we exchanged ideas. He was laconic, always his own man who knew what worked for him, and he did not deviate from this. Once he was injured during an Ontario Masters Cross Country race. He vowed never to run cross country races again, and this he kept to. \nEd began to appear frequently as a contender in my own record of road and track races in the mid 1990s. By then he was rewriting the masters record book as a 60-year-old. \nSome of the most memorable races that I ran with Ed from the 1980s on were several Jaspar to Banff and Cape Breton road relays. Our team at the later event was called Mad Dogs and Englishmen in his honour, I believe. Ed would run an awe-inspiring stage or two and then help the rest of us achieve our best. \nA book could and should be written of his athletic achievements over a long lifetime but his pure enjoyment of competition without malice will remain with me as long as I last. Ed Whitlock. RIP. Easily one of the ten greatest runners of all time. Faster in his seventies than most runners in their twenties. https://t.co/2prijtV1nU", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T09:03:19.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
