Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \niOS saw continued growth in almost every market around the world last quarter, according to the latest data, while iPhone 7 remains a top seller in key countries. \nAndroid also achieved market share increases in every region but the U.S., while BlackBerry, Windows, and other mobile operating systems continue to die out. \nIt’s been a two-horse race between iOS and Android for years now, and with BlackBerry having already given up on its own platform in favor of Google’s, it seems like it’s just a matter of time before Microsoft is forced to rethink its smartphone business. \nIn the three months leading up to January 2017, iOS saw continued growth throughout every region except for Japan, Spain, and urban China, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech . Android’s share also grew in every market but the U.S. \nGoogle saw its share of smartphone sales fall 1.8 percent to 56.4 percent on its home turf. The iPhone accounted for 42 percent of sales, up 2.9 percent year-on-year. “Seventy percent of the US domestic market is dominated by Apple and Samsung, and the third largest manufacturer, LG, accounted for an additional 11.1% of sales in the three months ending January 2017,” explains Kantar.\n“While the G6 [announced at Mobile World Congress last month] will be welcomed in the US, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on LG’s market share.” \nIn Europe’s biggest markets, Android bagged 74.3 percent of all sales, up from 72.9 percent during the same quarter last year. However, iPhone 7 remains the top-selling handset in the U.K., France, and Germany, helping Apple grab 22.7 percent of sales. \nIt’s thought Nokia’s new handsets will help boost Android growth even more next quarter, with Western European markets being historically loyal to the Finnish brand. \niPhone 7 is also the top-selling smartphone in urban China, despite Android grabbing 83.2 percent of all sales last quarter — an increase of 9.3 percent. Apple managed to grab 16.6 percent of sales, while Huawei shifted the most devices to grab a 26.6 percent share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T17:27:14.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
