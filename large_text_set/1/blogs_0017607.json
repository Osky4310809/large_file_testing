In that time, he has greeted and taken photos with countless tourists. He was even featured in a documentary, “Confessions of a Superhero.”\n“It made me feel amazing,” he said. “I was superman.”\nBut his career was quickly derailed about six months ago when he says he was attacked by a mugger while walking home from work.\n“He beat me down with golf clubs, knocking out my teeth and swinging it like a baseball bat,” Dennis said.\nThe mugger also took Dennis’ costume, laptop and more than $900 in cash. The attack left the performer deeply demoralized and directionless.\n“I felt like I died,” Dennis said. “Because for me, that was my livelihood.”\nSoon after, Dennis began living on the streets, begging for change.\n“I had to come up with a new way to come up with some kind of income to be able to survive,” he said.\nHe also struggled with drug abuse.\nBut Dennis’ luck began to change recently when a friend suggested he create a fundraising page to raise money for a new Superman costume.\nAt first, the money was slow to roll in. But the campaign soon gained traction on social media and the donations easily beat the campaign’s $1,000 goal.\nThe page has now raised more than $7,000 for Dennis’ cause. It has also helped restore Dennis’ faith in others.\n“I started losing faith in humanity,” he said. “These people who donated have shown me there is humanity and people do care.”\nWhat’s more, Local costume designers have offered to make Dennis a new costume for free so the performer can use the crowdfunding money to pay rent on a new apartment.\nDennis is currently staying at a clean living facility and working on his sobriety.\nWithin weeks, however, he expects to return to his place of business, donning a new cape.\n“I won’t be the same, but I’ll be a new man out there,” he said. “As soon as I get the outfits in the mail, I am going to be out there immediately.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T03:39:42.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
