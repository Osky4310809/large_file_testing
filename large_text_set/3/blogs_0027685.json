Voters opposed cutting federal funding to the health care program for the poor by 74 to 22 percent. One recent version of the bill would not allow any more states to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, allow states to require some enrollees work as a condition of getting coverage and begin reducing enrollment through attrition in 2020.\nThe survey of 1,056 voters across the country was conducted on landlines and cell phones from March 16 to 21. It has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:29:46.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
