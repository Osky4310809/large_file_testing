I have respect for the guys, so why would I say the guys are not good?\" \nGuardiola insisted his reputation for success in the game should not absolve him from criticism at the expense of his players. \n\"I don't understand the lack of respect for the professionals when they are amazing players and they are not good enough for me,\" he said. \n\"Maybe I am not good enough for them. \n\"They are Manchester City players, top players, they have a lot of quality. They showed that many times in the past and this season. \n\"I like to work with them and I want to help them and I am going to until my last day here and I want to stay as long as possible, more than ever. \n\"I want to stay and help them and [close] the gap between the top and the excellent teams. \n\"It's hard to achieve to get to the top four, but it's harder to achieve to go from fourth to first. I want to stay here for a long time and help them.\" \nGuardiola's reputation was forged as a developer of youth talent at Barcelona, having helmed the B team at Camp Nou. \nGuardiola impressed by Pochettino's work \nHis reluctance to throw youngsters such as Aleix Garcia and Tosin Adarabioyo into an ageing first team this season has been noted as a contrast, but Guardiola believes reserve teams in England are at a disadvantage when compared with their Spanish counterparts, who play a full part in Spanish football's professional pyramid. \n\"The atmosphere in the [U23s] and the Premier League, why we cannot create Man City or Man United second team and not play in the Championship against Newcastle?\" he added. \n\"They would play the second team for United, City, Tottenham and they compete with Newcastle - playing in front of these huge fans. \n\"That is the future of English football. But they play in this stadium [City's academy ground] and sometimes there is nobody unless it is on a Champions League night.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:49:54.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
