''Kingsglaive'' is set to be featured in both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of the game. − In addition, as part of an article on the reveal by USGamer, Tabata commented on ''XV'' and its expanded media being compared to the ''Fabula Nova Crystallis'' universe. When asked whether Tabata was attempting as smaller-scale version of the subseries with the multimedia approach to ''XV'', he stated: − \"I was personally responsible for one of the games in ''Fabula Nova Crystalis'', so I felt somewhat [unmanageable], yeah. But my focus is more making Final Fantasy XV work in this new era we find outselves in than trying to kind of reinvent ''Fabula Nova Crystallis''.\" − In addition, it has been announced that the game's official theme song will be a modern cover of the 1960s song \"Stand By Me\" by Florence Welch of band Florence & The Machine. A one-of-a-kind model of the Audi R8 inspired by the game is also being produced in collaboration with Audi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T03:31:56.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
