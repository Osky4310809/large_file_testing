And not just because they announced the wrong Best Picture winner. Jimmy Kimmel also had a bunch of fun audience bits, one of which led to a hilarious meme involving whispering Ryan Gosling which won the fake, but prestigious, Meme of the Night award.\nJimmy Kimmel hosted The Oscars ceremony and decided to bring a bunch of tourists into the Dolby Theater under the pretense of viewing old Hollywood Oscar dresses and gowns. Well, they showed up and the dresses were there and there were people wearing them and it was The Oscars!\nIt would be an understatement to say that these people were in shock. They walked across the front row shaking hands with and even hugging (!!!) Meryl Streep. They waved to Denzel. One woman in particular not only got a pair of Jennifer Aniston’s sunglasses but also got up close and personal with Ryan Gosling. He whispered in her ear aka she was living The Dream and became the envy of everyone.\nJimmy Kimmel / ABC The resulting moment became the Meme of the Night and Twitter collectively became hilarious with speculation of what Ryan Gosling could’ve whispered to her to shock her so much. Here’s a collection of some of the best tweets of the night that took a single moment and made it into comedy GOLD:\nThey are going to say La La Land, but Moonlight is actually going to win. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/g33c0gjvLx \n— Joseph Scrimshaw (@JosephScrimshaw) February 27, 2017 \"Bruce Willis was dead the whole time.\" pic.twitter.com/q6naBO4Cgs \n— Zach Braff (@zachbraff) February 27, 2017 \"I switched the 'Best Picture' envelopes.\" #Oscars pic.twitter.com/WeZbvQ91ha \n— Wade Evans (@wadeevans26) February 27, 2017 \"I went to school on a boat\" #Oscars pic.twitter.com/WjWE1iXTkM \n— Natalie Metcalfe (@nanametcalfe) February 27, 2017 \"i actually didn't write allie every day for a year.\" pic.twitter.com/99nyhumiQy \n— Kayla Yandoli (@kaylayandoli) February 27, 2017 GOSLING: Moonlight actually wins. pic.twitter.com/imqqEtvQiq \n— Hazel Hayes (@TheHazelHayes) February 27, 2017 \"Bruce Willis was dead the whole time.\" pic.twitter.com/q6naBO4Cgs \n— Zach Braff (@zachbraff) February 27, 2017 GOSLING: Jar Jar is the best Star Wars character. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/CcHKNEvJKS \n— Death Star PR (@DeathStarPR) February 27, 2017 GOSLING: I saved jazz music. pic.twitter.com/iUWbUqTbjk \n— Jamie Woodham (@jwoodham) February 27, 2017 \"HAIL HYDRA\" pic.twitter.com/giyOvFGJVM \n— Aaron Edwards (@aaronmedwards) February 27, 2017 So The Oscars didn’t run smoothly, but that provided the opportunity for plenty of humor on Twitter. And hey, we got some fun Ryan Gosling jokes out of the whole thing. So can we really complain?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:26:12.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
