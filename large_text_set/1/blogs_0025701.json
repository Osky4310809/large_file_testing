He said that if a week of advance notice was given \"the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week\". \nBut UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said that the ban was \"mean-spirited and wastes resources needed for proper counter-terrorism\". \nMr Trump's executive order halted the entire US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and suspended all nationals from the seven, Muslim-majority, countries. \nThe list does not include Saudi Arabia, where most of the hijackers in the 9/11 attacks came from. Image copyright AFP Image caption Protesters in Brussels took to the streets to denounce the ban \nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which has 57 member states, said the restrictions would only help extremists. \nCountries including Britain and Germany have sought assurances that their citizens with dual nationality will be protected. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel criticised the restrictions again on Monday, saying the fight against terrorism does not justify \"general suspicion against people of a specific faith\". \nSome European politicians, including Czech President Milos Zeman and Dutch anti-immigration firebrand Geert Wilders, have praised the ban. \nIn the US, 16 state attorneys general have said the order is unconstitutional. Several federal judges have temporarily halted the deportation of visa holders. Media caption Donald Trump supporters give their views on the ban from New York's Staten Island \nThree African countries - Somalia, Sudan and Libya - are on the banned list and as a result the African Union (AU) was facing one of its \"greatest tests\", AU commission chief Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has said. \nSpeaking at the pan-African body's annual summit in Ethiopia, she said the world was entering \"very turbulent times\": \n\"For example, the very country to whom our people were taken as slaves during the transatlantic slave trade, has now decided to ban refugees from some of our countries,\" Ms Dlamini-Zuma said. \nTrump ban sparks Middle East anger \nIn Iraq, the government is facing calls from lawmakers to enact a reciprocal ban on US citizens. \nThe foreign ministry called for the White House to review its decision, noting it is an \"allied state linked by strategic partnership with the United States\". Media caption US immigration order: Families split as Trump ban enforced \nIn the UK, more than a million people have signed a petition to stop Donald Trump's planned state visit later this year. Protests in response to the executive order are set to take place in several cities later. Who is affected by the ban? \nAs well as the ban on all refugees, travellers who have nationality or dual nationality of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are not permitted to enter the US for 90 days, or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa. \nThis includes those who share dual nationality with allied countries, including the UK , though there remains much confusion. Click to see content: immigrants_us \nThe UK Foreign Office says that only those dual nationals travelling from one of the blacklisted seven countries would be subject to extra checks. \nBut there have been several reports contradicting that. BBC reporter Ali Hamedani, an Iranian-born British citizen, was detained and had his phone searched when he flew into Chicago from London. \nSome US Green Card holders - legal residents - have been detained since the order came into effect but they are now exempt from the ban, according to the Department of Homeland Security. What does the White House say? \nMr Trump tweeted early on Sunday that the US needed \"extreme vetting, NOW\" but later, in a statement, tried to offer more reassuring words, saying: \"This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. \n\"We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,\" he said. \nIn a tweet on Monday morning, Mr Trump placed the blame for any perceived chaos at the airports on protesters, \"the tears of Senator [Chuck] Schumer\" and Delta Airlines, which had a computer issue on Sunday which led to the cancellation of 170 flights, and another 110 on Monday. \nDelta operates more than 5,400 flights a day. \nMr Trump also said \"only 109 people out of 325,000\" travelling, had been detained for extra questioning. \nA Department of Homeland Security official told ABC News there were 735 \"encounters\" related to the executive order as of Sunday evening.

In other global reaction: Canada is offering temporary residence to those stranded there because of the US order, the immigration minister said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier tweeted that Canada welcomed \"those fleeing persecution, terror and war\" A spokesperson for UK PM Theresa May said she \"did not agree\" with the restrictions, and French independent presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron tweeted: \"I stand with the people fleeing war and persecution.\" Meanwhile, Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull has thanked President Trump after he confirmed that the US would uphold its agreement to accept vulnerable asylum seekers held in Australia's offshore detention centres in Papua New Guinea and Nauru Israel is seeking to clarify whether the ban applies to tens of thousands of elderly Israeli Jews born in Middle Eastern countries \nHave you or your family been affected by the entry restrictions?
