She even held a star studded premiere last night for her industry friends like Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor, Karan Johar among others. While other celebs just made their presence felt for some time, her special friend Ranveer Singh was by her side throughout the event. The actor made sure he was with his lady love. Interestingly, the handsome actor didn't just be with Deepika last night. He also flew down to USA when the gorgeous actress was shooting there. When we asked the film's director DJ Caruso about the meeting he said, \"Ranveer was amazing. He came up for a while and he is so full of positive energy. He came in with a big hug and later we became so friendly. And he probably came in at the right time when she (Deepika) was away from her home. He hung out for few days.\" He added, \"Ranveer would be amazing to work with. Because of his vibrancy and energy.\" Quiz him if he would want to cast both Ranveer and Deepika together in a film and the director states, \"You guys are used to seeing them together. I would surely want to cast them. It would be fantastic and I wouldn't have to worry about the chemistry too.\" Well, we quite agree to that!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:21:00.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
