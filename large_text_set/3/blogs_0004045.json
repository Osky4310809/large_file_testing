Mar 6, 2017 10:58 AM \nmoney is on Tampa Mar 6, 2017 11:00 AM \n“However, don’t discount the quality of the team’s quarterback play.” \nYet Tampa Bay is in play? snakecage says: Mar 6, 2017 11:01 AM \nWouldn’t mind him back as a Redskin as long as we don’t break the bank. We got lucky with the last contract. newmancave2016 says: Mar 6, 2017 11:02 AM \nI have a strange feeling it’s going to be Philly. The media makes it seem less likely, but I think he wants to come back and play with Wentz. The Eagles are good at keeping lid on lately, so we’ll see. edon8334 says: Mar 6, 2017 11:02 AM \nPlease stay in Washington, we’ll get rid of Cousins for you..just please stay.. You Doctson, Reed, Davis…maybe Garcon will want to stay ..we’ll be good with McCoy or Kaep or maybe even Romo jjackwagon says: Mar 6, 2017 11:04 AM \nSince it will be his last chance at big money…expect him to go to the highest bidder. Mar 6, 2017 11:04 AM \n“The team with the better QB will get the nod”…. \nInteresting. Will the Redskins even know who their QB will be in 2017 by Thursday? williamxl22 says: Mar 6, 2017 11:06 AM \nNot a Buccaneers fan, but I can see him signing with them. He would be a great addition for a great, young quarterback who already has a great receiver to throw to. weepingjebus says: Mar 6, 2017 11:09 AM \nHopefully he doesn’t drop the offer before he crosses the line. billco6192012 says: Mar 6, 2017 11:12 AM \nThe big year will take a turn when Jackson trips and falls on a blade of grass and misses 4 four weeks again. Mar 6, 2017 11:13 AM \nSeattle… On to Seattle Mar 6, 2017 11:17 AM \nBest offer. godeepwvu says: Mar 6, 2017 11:17 AM \nIf this clown gets big money, it shows how badly broken the NFL is at that position. richardmswartz says: Mar 6, 2017 11:19 AM \nAn aging undersized speedster? Just because someone’s agent says something doesn’t make it true. Mar 6, 2017 11:22 AM \nOne trick pony. nickbowes80 says: Mar 6, 2017 11:24 AM \nDeSean Jackson would look mighty nice in a Bucs jersey next year lining up opposite of Mike Evans. bleedingfacemask says: Mar 6, 2017 11:26 AM \nSo you’re saying that the 49ers will need to figure out how to pay a gazillion dollars? udkidd says: Mar 6, 2017 11:28 AM \nI bet he signs with Tampa Bay. Good young QB with a strong arm. Great WR in Mike Evans across from him would definitely open up the deep ball. Homerun threat in Jackson. Great weather in TB. Offensive division rivals in ATL and NO. They could definitely use him. Plus TB has a lot of great young defensive players. They could easily compete for the best team in the division this year if/when he signs there. greg3117 says: Mar 6, 2017 11:33 AM \nDude is a merc, but I can’t say I don’t blame him. It’s unlikely he’ll be back in DC on a reasonable deal, but I’d like to have him back for a few more years before his speed takes a turn for the worse. cueghost says: Mar 6, 2017 11:34 AM \nExactly how big of a contract is he expecting? It’s not like we’re talking about a top 5 or even top 10 WR in the NFL… This guys best days are already behind him and he’s never been known as a good locker room guy either. I don’t see him getting big guaranteed money, no way. eazeback says: Mar 6, 2017 11:35 AM \nno way in the world he should get a big payday…he disappears in far too many games and he also has a history of injuries Mar 6, 2017 11:38 AM \n“All things equal, the team with the better quarterback will likely get the nod.” \nThere goes the Viking’s chances, they will have to resort to playing Treadslow. scmems07 says: Mar 6, 2017 11:39 AM \nWould rather have Stills. He’s younger, doesn’t get injured as much and is just as fast if not faster than Jackson. hendawg21 says: Mar 6, 2017 11:41 AM \nAlthough a dynamic threat, I wouldn’t want to throw too much money Jackson’s way, his only threat is the deep ball other than that he’s not going to give much of anything else that would justify the contract he may get. And as a small stature fellow he gets hurt easily and far too often. He is a difference maker, however, again I’m not sure I’d want to give up that much loot to bring him in and at 30 and getting older this deal may be a crap shoot. TheDPR says: Mar 6, 2017 11:42 AM \nI’d offer him vet minimum. A 30 year old who’s a speed guy who hasn’t played a full season since 2013 doesn’t merit a big money contract. That speed could be gone in a moment and then you’re left with a mercenary with a bad ROI. No thanks. Mar 6, 2017 11:50 AM \nFans want Desean more than GMs want Desean, I’m willing to bet… Mar 6, 2017 11:52 AM \n“Jackson? You look like a Jackson.” Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
