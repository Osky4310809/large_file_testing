Mammoth says that’s enough snow to keep the lifts running until at least July 4. \nMore than 20 feet fell during January alone. And more snow is predicted for the weeks to come. \nThe Los Angeles Times says that in 2010-2011, when the resort also stayed open until July 4, snowfall totaled almost 56 feet. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
