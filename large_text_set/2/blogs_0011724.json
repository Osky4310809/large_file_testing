Today's freebies are packed with professional level features and are astonishingly easy to use. \nPerhaps your needs are very basic and you simply want to trim unwanted sections out of a clip. Alternatively, you might want to get more adventurous – splicing clips together, adding transitions and special effects, applying video and audio effects, and using chroma-keying to replace backgrounds. \nWe've got both scenarios covered, and all the video editors featured here are free to download and use. \nHave we missed your favorite? Let us know in the comments below. Lightworks is a superb free video editor trusted by professional filmmakers, and is free to download and use. It's surprisingly intuitive for such powerful software, and you'll achieve brilliant results 1. Lightworks \nPutting professional-quality tools within reach of everyone, Lightworks is the best free video editor \nLightworks is far much more than a simple tool for cutting clips – the pro version has been used to create big-name movies including The King's Speech and Road to Perdition. \nAs you would expect for such a powerful video editor, you won't be able to master it overnight, but that's certainly not something you could hold against it. \nLightworks is described as the professional video editor for everyone, and we reckon that's a fair summary. Despite its power, it will run well on fairly modest hardware, and it handles video capture and advanced editing with aplomb. \nIf you've tried other free video editors you'll probably find that the interface is a little different to anything you're used to, but you can arrange the various controls and windows to create something that suits your way of working. \nDownload here: Lightworks If you've ever used Windows Movie Maker, you'll pick up VideoPad in seconds. Its interface is similar, though it's a much more powerful free video editor 2. VideoPad Video Editor \nSimple to use, even for complete newcomers. Not as feature-packed as Lightworks, but still excellent \nFree video editors have a tendency to be either simple to use and limited in terms of features, or powerful and time-consuming to learn. VideoPad Video Editor does an excellent job of avoiding both pitfalls – a powerful editor that you can easily navigate, even if you've never used anything similar in the past. \nThis ease of use plays a big part in VideoPad's appeal, but it also comes highly recommended because of the sheer range of tools it has on offer. It may not be quite as feature-packed as Lightworks, but it's much easier to just jump straight into. \nYou can work with video footage that's already on your hard drive, or capture from your connected camcorder. You then have access to a plethora of video and audio editing tools (effects, transitions, sequencing and more), the likes of which would not be out of place in a premium video editor. Shotcut offers an array of advanced options for fine-tuning audio and video. Its interface takes some getting used to, but it's worth the effort 3. Shotcut \nIt takes a little time to master Shotcut's unusual interface, but once you do, you'll reap the benefits \nShotcut is another professional-feeling free video editor that requires a little patience if you are achieve the results it is so capable of delivering. The slightly unusual interface can be put down to the fact that this started life as a Linux application, and little has changed in its conversion to Windows. \nTo start with, the interface may seem a little stark. You will need to not only load a video, but also choose which editing mode you would like to work in and which tools you'd like to use. \nThere's no getting away from the fact that Shotcut has a steep learning curve. It's possible to achieve some impressive results by simply applying one of its many filters to your video, but the real rewards will only be reaped by those willing to invest the time and energy in fully getting to grips with what's on offer. \nDownload here: Shotcut VSDC Free Video Editor has recently received a major upgrade, and now boasts a vastly expanded array of editing tools and filters to enhance your clips 4. VSDC Free Video Editor \nA non-linear video editor stacked with tools, VSDC is very impressive and in constant development \nVSDC Free Video Editor provides a huge array of effects and filters to enhance your footage, with both wizards and manual options to suit beginners or more advanced users. \nVSDC is highly capable, and can yield superb results. As a non-linear editor, it works in rather a different way to many other similar tools, letting you position clips and other elements on the timeline wherever you like and edit them there. \nWith the ability to not only work with multiple scenes and transitions, but also to add sprites and text to videos, you can create a professional-quality movie if you're willing to stick with VSDC's slightly odd way of working and unusual interface. For basic editing jobs, Avidemux is ideal. It's uncomplicated and has all the essentials covered 5. Avidemux \nAn accessible free video editor, Avidemux is ideal for small editing tasks and enhancing clips \nOne thing to understand about Avidemux from the outset is that it is not going to help you create the next Star Wars or to become a master movie producer. Rather, it's a set of essential tools for everyday video editing, covering all of the basics such as converting formats, trimming footage, appending one clip to another, and applying filters and effects. \nWhile Avidemux isn't offer the most powerful free video editor, it's not a pared-back Windows Movie Maker style affair either. You might have to go hunting for some of the more advanced options, but spend a little time perusing the menus and you'll be impressed. \nThere's also", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:06:04.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
