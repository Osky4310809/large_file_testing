The drummer's son, Adam, told TMZ that attempts to revive him using CPR and a defibrillator were unsuccessful.\nThe cruise began off the coast of Florida on March 18 and was scheduled to stop in a number of places including Puerto Rico and the Bahamas. TMZ reports that the cruise will continue, with other musicians set to pay tribute to the fallen rock star.\nAccompanying Hashian on the cruise were fellow ex-band member Barry Goudreau, former Foreigner singer Lou Gramm, former Beach Boy David Marks and former Kansas singer John Elefante, according to Ultimate Classic Rock.\nHashian played on Boston's 1976 debut self-titled album -- which included the mega-hit \"More Than A Feeling\" -- as well as the band's 1978 follow-up album \"Don't Look Back.\" He left the group during production of 1986's \"Third Stage,\" Boston's third release. Over the years he continued to record music with his former bandmates, playing drums on guitarist Barry Goudreauâ€™s solo album and occasionally performing alongside bassist Fran Sheehan and singer Brad Delp.\n\nLater in life Hashian pursued a number of business ventures and dabbled in acting. At the time of his death he owned a record store and a network of tanning salons in Boston.\nHashian is survived by his wife and three children. One of his daughters, Lauren, has a child with actor Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and previously appeared on the reality competition show \"R U the Girl.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:03:45.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
