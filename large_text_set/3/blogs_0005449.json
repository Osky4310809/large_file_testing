Now a handful of purported live images of the Korean tech giant’s next flagship have also hit the interwebs. The freshly leaked live images reveal the front, sides, top and bottom part of the device, but miss out on the back. \nThe images posted by BGR reveal that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will flaunt minimal bezels on top and bottom of the edge-to-edge display. The device will not sport a home button and its fingerprint sensor could be placed beside the rear camera. The phone will be rounded on the sides, and will have a speaker grille, a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack at the bottom. \nThe Samsung Galaxy S8+ is expected to offer the same design as the Galaxy S8, but will carry a bigger 6.2-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED screen compared to the 5.8-inch display of the Galaxy S8. The former is also expected to sport a bigger battery. The rest of their specs are expected to be the same. \nThe S8 and S8+ are expected to come with Snapdragon 835 processors (in the US) / Exynos 9 processors (global markets), 4GB of RAM, 64GB to 256GB of expandable storage, 12MP Dual Pixel cameras, Iris scanners, Samsung’s new virtual assistant Bixby, IP68 certification for water resistance and Android Nougat. The company has already announced that the new Galaxy flagship will be unveiled on March 29th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T06:58:34.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
