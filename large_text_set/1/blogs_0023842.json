REUTERS/Dan Balilty/Pool 5449143 \nAt least six out of the seven countries targeted by President Donald Trump’s latest executive order have visa policies that discriminate against Israel. \n  temporarily prohibiting citizens from seven majority Muslim countries — specifically   from entering the U.S. \nOf that group, Iran , Syria , Libya , Yemen , and Sudan all refuse entry to foreign travelers holding passports or travel documents indicating that they have been to or are affiliated in some way with Israel. \nIsraeli nationals are not permitted to transit through Iraq , Iran , Libya , Yemen , Syria , or Sudan , even in situations where the traveler does not intend to leave the aircraft. \nIn Syria, individuals suspected of having affiliations with Israel have been detained for questioning. \nThese discriminatory visa policies are religiously motivated. Some have arrived at similar conclusions about Trump’s latest executive order, declaring the move a “Muslim ban,” but the order only restricts entry for travelers from a few predominantly-Muslim countries, not all of them. \nFor instance, the new policies do not apply to citizens of Indonesia, which has the world’s largest Muslim population. \nThe primary focus of Trump’s policies is combating Islamic terrorism. \n“We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our countries the very threats that our soldiers are fighting overseas,” Trump said Friday. He stressed that his latest order is designed to “keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America” and “to protect the American people.” \nThe order aims to eliminate threats to the American populace. Temporarily restricting travel from certain terror-prone countries gives the administration time to establish an improved screening process, what Trump refers to as “extreme vetting.” \nThe order states that “the United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T01:54:43.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
