Their two major spots appeared disjointed and messy, and the match was nothing special, to say the least. Miz's promo and the beatdown afterward, though, were fantastic. It set the tone for the obvious mixed tag team match that will occur at WrestleMania, though not officially announced, and put heat on Miz and his wife in the process. It made them a threat to the happy union of Cena and Bella, which his exactly what should happen. A quality segment overall, even if the match was essentially an afterthought. Curt Hawkins Calls Out Dean Ambrose 4 of 7 A week ago, Dean Ambrose flattened Curt Hawkins, courtesy of Dirty Deeds. Tuesday, Hawkins took exception to his treatment at the hands of The Lunatic Fringe and called him out. It did not end well for him. Hawkins rushed Ambrose but ate a clothesline. From there, the intercontinental champion called out Baron Corbin. He questioned The Lone Wolf's manhood and reiterated his desire for his rival to come face him. Corbin appeared on the video screen and vowed to take everything from Ambrose, including his title, but he was not going to answer guys who called him out. He does things on his own time. Ambrose decided to take the fight to Corbin, but not before dropping Hawkins with another Dirty Deeds. Once backstage, Ambrose found himself attacked by Corbin, who used a pipe to bash his knee. With Ambrose immobilized, Corbin used a forklift to crush the IC champion's ribs. Agents and officials pulled The Lone Wolf away as Ambrose was left writhing in pain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T14:05:41.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
