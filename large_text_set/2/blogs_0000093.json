The story is the same the next time they visit the grocery store, except the little girl is emboldened by previous victory. Who hasn’t heard such a tale? Apparently not the fashionable American left, who have breathlessly played defense for rioters since they used violence to silence a speaker with dissenting opinions at UC Berkeley on Wednesday night. \nThe riots, which involved making innocent women and beating unconscious people with poles, seems to be a generalization of that trying-to-be-edgy-but-isn’t-really meme about punching Nazis. Nazis are scumbags; this nobody denies. But you can’t trust the radical left to behave honestly with a definition. As soon as it has one in its grasp the meaning becomes unrecognizable, tortured into an alien shape for a political agenda. Violence that was once reserved for Nazis (read: virtually nobody) becomes acceptable against “alt-righters,” and then against Trump supporters, and then against anyone to the right of Hillary Clinton. There’s no limiting principle here. \nMilo Yiannopoulos, who was scheduled to speak at Berkeley before frothing ideologues brutalized the campus into no-platforming him, is essentially a paleoconservative – that is, what a typical American right-winger was before the ascendance of the neoconservatives during the Cold War. Anti-immigration, anti-feminism and criticism of Islam is pretty standard for this perhaps more genuine conservatism, but the media paints Milo as “far-right” or “white nationalist,” with even reputable sources like Reuters trading its credibility for hyberbole in service of wokeness. \nBesides being flamboyantly gay, what distinguishes him from others of that label is the fact that he frames his in deliberately confrontional ways. And who could fault him? His brand is so effective that the mononym “Milo” is virtually at household-levels of recognition, thanks to the media’s reflex of clutching pearls first and asking questions later. Media progressives would throw their clout behind every attempt to censor or bully him, saying that he was committing “hate speech,” despite there being no such legal concept in the United States. \nFor all the left’s mewling about a hatred-inciting boogeyman, all the actual violence became ended up being directed. Reality didn’t fit the narrative. But as ever, there’s a solution: torture definitions into the appropriate shape until you invert reality. In the upside-down space of ideology, Milo and his ilk actually committed violence, we’re supposed to believe, because their bad opinions are violence. Violence, on the other hand, Doesn’t make sense? It isn’t supposed to. It doesn’t have to. This was the original post-truth politics, one whose birth far in 1970s academia long predates the rise of Trump. Facts don’t matter. They are just another tool that’s instrumental to political ends. \nThe problem for anti-fascists is that fascism has been extinct in the wild for the better part of a century. This is pretty obvious to anyone that isn’t delusional. But we live in a society where communism passes the dinner table test, but sober discussion. Only by stoking paranoia about cartoon villains is this sustainable. Violent protesters will continue to act as the enforcers for left-wing media elites who give phoned-in denouncements of riots while simultaneously telling Americans that we should probably shut up and fall in line if we don’t want our heads bashed in. \nThat’s the interesting thing about witch hunts: it’s always the hunters who have the power, and never the witches. If witches were actually had powers that made them worth hunting, why don’t they defend themselves with their awesome power? That’s because witches don’t exist, just like fascists with any sort of meaningful power in contemporary society. But don’t expect facts to stop left-wing violence. It will only end when it ceases to achieve its goal of stamping out dissenting thought.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:51:11.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
