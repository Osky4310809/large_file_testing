We want the modern FCO to reflect the very best of 21st century Britain and encourage applications from all suitably qualified applicants irrespective of background or circumstances. Our Diversity and Equality Report 2016 includes data on the equality impact of the Foreign Office’s employment practices and activities. \nIn return, we guarantee a fascinating, personally rewarding career at the centre of world events. The FCO regularly scores highly in surveys of “employers graduates would most like to work for”. For example, we have moved up to 4th place in The Times Top 100 Graduate Employers 2016-17. Our staff \nThe FCO employs around 14,000 staff around the world. Roughly one third is made up of UK-based British Civil Servants whose careers typically include work in the UK and postings overseas; and around two thirds are employed locally by a British Diplomatic mission overseas (such as an Embassy, High Commission, or Consulate). Applicants for these roles should be based in that country and usually need to be able to work in the main local language. For information on our local staff vacancies, please visit the web page for the country you are interested in working in . Recruitment policy: generalists and specialists \nAll appointments to the FCO are made in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the Civil Service Commission. \nRecruitment into the FCO’s UK-based workforce is normally either as a generalist (i.e. into the Diplomatic or Home Civil Service cadres where staff rotate between a variety of roles, including overseas), or as a specialist (i.e. taking up a specific role requiring specialist skills, eg research analysts, lawyers). \nThe Civil Service-wide recruitment freeze introduced in May 2010 limits new appointments to frontline and business-critical jobs only, which normally means specialist roles. This has generally restricted FCO generalist recruitment permitted under the freeze to the Diplomatic Service Fast Stream . Diplomatic Service Economists are also recruited through the Government Economic Service Fast Stream. Visits to universities \nOur staff will be visiting a number of universities across the UK in 2017 to explain what we do and how rewarding a career in the FCO can be. Please follow our @fcocareers Twitter account (#BeForeignOffice and #FastStream) for the latest information and also look out for details about events taking place close to you from your university careers service. Vacancies Consul General, New York \nTo lead the large, cross-government team in New York to promote the UK’s extensive economic, commercial, political and consular interests in New York and the region. \nThe Consul General’s primary focus is prosperity – advancing the UK’s trade and investment interests, promoting our economic reputation, developing science and innovation links, advocating for free trade and projecting our climate action agenda. However, top level representational and communications work (promoting the UK and its activities), high quality political networking and reporting (New York is Donald Trump’s power base and a political centre in its own right) and careful oversight of a sustained consular workload are also key elements of the role. \nThe Consul General (and DG International Trade) role is hugely rewarding, based in one of the world’s most vibrant cities that is critical to the UK’s economic interests and our reputation as a global player. The US is the UK’s largest bilateral trade and investment partner, accounting for 19% of UK exports and 27% of foreign direct investment. Post-Brexit, the UK’s relationship with the US is arguably even more important. US investment sustains around 1 million jobs in the UK; UK investors employ a similar number of Americans. New York alone is the US’s main financial centre and a global leader in tech, advanced manufacturing and the creative arts. Key roles and responsibilities visible and inspiring leadership of a large, cross-government operation in New York (150 staff; 7+ partners across government, including the Department for International Trade (DIT), UKVI, British Council, Visit Britain, GREAT) strategic leadership of the DIT Network in the US and Canada, which is centred in New York (with an SMS1 director) and leads teams in 9 additional cities across the country, including the Trade Policy team in Washington trade policy: leading the US-based work on market access discussions with the US administration (supported by the team in Washington DC) prosperity: building relationships with senior business and economic leaders with impact on UK prosperity (in New York the financial, creative industries and tech sectors are particularly important) policy: establishing a strong network of political players in New York and the region, both on domestic and foreign policy (New York has long been politically influential but is increasingly important as President Trump’s power base) oversight of a busy consular operation, given the numbers of British residents in New York and the region and the high numbers of UK visitors each year crisis preparedness and leadership in the NY consular district developing and motivating a diverse and energetic team in New York a strong corporate role as a senior leader in the US Network, working with the ambassador and deputy head of mission in Washington, to drive change under the Diplomacy 20:20 agenda \nThe CG will sit on the DIT Executive Committee. \nNew York is a magnet for top level visitors from the UK, each year seeing visits from members of the Royal Family, the Prime Minister and other members of cabinet along with many junior ministers and officials. Putting together imaginative programmes which advance UK interests and hosting the visitors in an important part of the CG role. \nPublic diplomacy and communications work are also a significant part of the job. New York is a vibrant, global player on the media scene and therefore provides a effective platform to promote the UK’s prosperity and wider interests to a large audience. \nThe Consul General has a busy representational role, including making full use of the British Residence in New York to host a wide variety of events and visitors to promote British interests. \nThe jobholder will find him/herself working principally for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Trade. \nSalary to be negotiated. Our expectation is that the successful candidate will be paid between £87,000 and £120,000 depending on experience.

Work experience \nThe FCO aims to recruit a talented and diverse workforce which reflects the society we serve. In order to generate interest in FCO careers from a broader applicant base, the FCO offers a range of work experience opportunities each year. We hope that by giving individuals from a range of backgrounds the opportunity to sample working at the FCO they may consider the FCO as a future employer, as well as gaining beneficial work experience. \nOur work experience opportunities, which are paid, are mainly focused on attracting individuals from backgrounds that are currently under-represented in our workforce, and on those who bring skills which we require to achieve our objectives. All work experience placements are awarded strictly on merit, after a competitive application process. In order to ensure our opportunities are accessible to all those who are eligible, we do not offer any work experience opportunities to individuals on an ad-hoc basis. We do not have the resources to acknowledge or respond to speculative applications. \nAll of our work experience schemes are centrally run by either the FCO or other government departments (such as the Civil Service Fast Stream and the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP) . Our annual programme of schemes is reviewed each year and are published on this page. Please note, the application windows for each of the Government schemes vary and the relevant website should be checked for further details. \nThe recruitment campaigns for our 2016 schemes have now ended. Please see below for details of the schemes we offered. \nYou can also follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Linked In or sign up to our RSS feeds . \nThe FCO’s external recruitment campaigns are run separately from any work experience or internship scheme: work experience does not in any way guarantee future employment with the FCO. Our recruitment for permanent employment is merit-based in strict accordance with the key recruitment principles of the Civil Service Commission. Current or former interns do not receive any preferential treatment in the selection processes. FCO Internship Schemes \nIn 2016 we offered the following work experience schemes: \nThe Civil Service Fast Stream Summer Diversity Internship Programme (SDIP) .
