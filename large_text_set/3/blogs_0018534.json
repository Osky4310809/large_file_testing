The problem is mainly in Lagos, whose light is managed by Tinubu’s distribution company. He is dealing with u, all in the name of politics. Keep voting for trash.

NaijaMindOfChange \nYou probably might be on drugs, 1.5million homes in Nigeria only 1 home have light, is that success sed \nYou must be deranged. That bribe that u collected to make spurious claims here will put you in trouble soon. \nMay be he wants to tell us that he will make provision of generator for all….. NaijaMindOfChange \nGEJ want to tell Nigerians to endure the corruption going on in his administration while he is busy given award to past corrupt leaders moh \nPropagandist government eddy \nIs he going to tell us where our $20billions is? If not then make e no bother. No one is interested in his lies. Tour Planet Lagos \nThe Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative said on Wednesday that a whopping $22.8billion was yet to be declared by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in its alternative funding arrangements with Joint Venture Partners. \nNEITI told the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream) that the findings came out of its audit report on the finances of the oil corporation for 2009 to 2011. \nThe committee, which is headed by Mr. Ajibola Muraina, is investigating the alleged connivance of the NNPC with Swiss oil trading companies to “defraud Nigeria of billions of dollars of crude oil revenue.” \nThe country had reportedly lost about $6.8billion as of 2013 to the connivance, which the ‘Bernes Declaration’ said involved the sale of Nigeria’s crude oil below international prices. \nOnly on Tuesday, the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mr. Andrew Yakubu, had appeared before the committee to deny the Bernes Declaration. yetundeOnigbogi \nNow, I am fully convinced (except Abati made a mistake about the content of the address) that Nigeria has no hope under this government. 43 INNOCENT CHILDREN WERE MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD BY AN UNTAMED SECT AND MR PRESIDENT DID NOT ADDRESS THE NATION TO COMMISERATE WITH THE AFFECTED FAMILIES AND TO REASSURE NIGERIANS, BUT HE CAN COME ON AIR TO TALK ABOUT CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS!!! Nigeria!!!! MY GOD! What a leader we have got!! (I hope this is not true) Stephen \nI watched the the address of the President, but I was disappointed hearing only the common story that we leant in the primary shool in those days when I was very young but I had shoes and the fake promises on how he is willing to tackle the menace of boko haram Insurgency. It is a pity to have such a man like this that should be in charge of big nation like Nigeria, at a time when such huge amount like 20 billion U.S. dollars disappeared into thin air and many people are accusing him of theft of that money that did not even clarify himself before the populace, with this kind of action I AM OF THE OPINION THAT OUR PRESIDENTS HANDS MAY NOT BE CLEAN. OYEDIRAN A. \nYes, i agree with you the address sound common, but tune to bbc now , the world is analysing the address and we are calling it common, God will help me to get there, where every common statement i made would be analys in bbc and other world news channel. sed \nWhat stupid analysis are you talking about and which bbc? You people just keep spreading rubbish deceiving yourselves . \nWe do not have light….. How do want us to watch and listen to you…. Guguru \nThe President will also need to fire the NEITI for disclosing another missing $22 billion in the same vein as he fired Sanusi for disclosing $20 billion. Is the President going to fire Madueke and the GMD of NNPC or not? \n“A fresh $22.8 billion undisclosed proceeds not reflected in the books of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, has been revealed by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. \nThis disclosure was made known on Wednesday at the Hon. Muraino Ajibola- headed House of Representatives joint committee of Petroleum (Upstream), Petroleum (Downstream) and Justice sitting, investigating the allegation by a Swiss- based Non- Governmental and Advocacy organization – Berne Declaration, that two Swiss oil trading companies, Vitol and Trafigura, in connivance with NNPC have skimmed the country off about $6.8 billion in two years.” \nThe Nation newspaper, 26 February, 2013, “Fresh unremitted $22.8bn found in NNPC” \ncaption: Reno Omokri By SaharaReporters, New York Reno Omokri, the outspoken Special Assistant on Social Media to President Goodluck Jonathan, was today unmasked as the brain behind a fraudulent attempt to link Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, the suspended Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), to the recent spike in Boko Haram violence in Borno and Yobe States. In one of the recent attacks, Boko Haram terrorists slaughtered some 60 secondary school students at their boarding house. Posing as “Wendell Simlin,” Mr. Omokri circulated a Word document linking the former CBN Governor to the recent attacks. The ruse was however uncovered when some Internet-savvy Nigerians traced the IP address of the source document and it turned out that it had been authored and circulated by Mr. Omokri. This scandal, the latest in a series of ethical and corruption issues rocking the Jonathan administration, set Twitter on fire today. Outraged Nigerians called for Mr. Omokri’s sack. The timing of Mr. Omokri’s fraudulent act is particularly insensitive, with many commentators questioning why a member of President Jonathan’s inner circle would seek to capitalize on the blood of slaughtered innocent children by forging documents to implicate a perceived “enemy” of the Jonathan administration. Mr. Omokri’s callous forgery began to unfold today at about 11.54 a.m. (Nigerian time) when certain media outlets and editors received an email from one Wendell Simlin ( [email protected] ) with the headline “Increased Tempo of Boko Haram/Terrorist Activity in the Wake of the Sanusi Saga”. The email included a Word document which sought to use spurious circumstantial evidence laced with a heavy dose of innuendo to suggest that the renewed Boko Haram attacks in the Northeast were linked to Mr. Sanusi’s recent suspension as CBN governor. Curiously, the document also contained attacks on Alhaji Umaru Mutallab, the father of the jailed Christmas Day Underwear bomber, Umar Farouk Mutallab. Several tech-savvy individuals tried to ascertain who the author was and why such critical information was emerging from a “strange” and unknown name. The investigations turned up the following evidence: 1. They found a Wendell Simlin on Facebook with only one photo. That photo had Mr. Reno Omokri in it. While the photo has since been deleted, a screenshot was taken before the deletion and it is hereby published. 2. Further circumstantial evidence, such as friendships on Facebook, including ‘liked’ pages, strongly linked the account of Mr. Simlin to Mr Omokri. Some Internet investigators also discovered that there was a lot of interaction linking the “shadowy” Mr. Simlin to Mr Omokri as far back as 2010. 3. A check of the IP address from which the email was sent indicated somewhere around the Kubwa area in Abuja with the IP address of 41.78.81.189. 4. But the most damning evidence was found in the Word document “Simlin” sent out as news, which had the author’s name as Reno Omokri. Those who received the original email have also done a check and confirmed that Mr. Omokri’s name was on it. Investigations further confirmed the person who saved and edited the document to be Mr. Omokri. Both screenshots are reproduced here. Prior to today’s development, Mr. Omokri had already developed a reputation for a pattern of using a variety of identities (aliases and screen names) on the Internet to attack and smear the names of perceived enemies of Mr. Jonathan. Analysts say that, even if Mr. Omokri was acting alone, the fact that he is officially a Special Assistant to the President implicates the Presidency in his callous effort to exploit a shocking tragedy in order to smear the former CBN Governor. The unmasking of Mr. Omokri as the author and mastermind of the grave forgery is likely to dent the Presidency as it sends the message that Mr. Jonathan may secretly encourage the very dirty tactics to which he publicly objects. Reno Omokri’s fake “Wendell Simlin” facebook account now disabledReno Omokri’s Word document properties revealing he created the fake documents linking Sanusi’s sack to increase in Boko Haram attacks Original copies will also be available on Saharareporters fanpage on facebook.
