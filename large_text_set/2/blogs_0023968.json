It will now be up to states and school districts to interpret whether federal sex discrimination law applies to gender identity.\nA letter sent to schools nationwide Wednesday by the Justice and Education departments says the earlier directive caused confusion and lawsuits over how it should be applied. The new letter says the guidance is lifted, but anti-bullying safeguards will not be affected.\nAlthough the Obama guidance was not legally binding, transgender rights advocates say it was necessary to protect students from discrimination. Opponents argued it was federal overreach.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:16.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
