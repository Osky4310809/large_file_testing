The sophisticated gadgets keep tabs on your every move, providing powerful, around-the-clock metrics to help you improve your fitness and achieve other health goals. You’re generally okay with these devices’ inherent creep factor because they’re incredibly useful and only you can see the data. But what if your boss had access to how many steps you took today, or could see just how long you plopped your keister in your desk chair without getting up to move? \nIf that sounds like an invasion of privacy to you, British people beg to differ. In a recent survey by AXA PPP Health Tech & You—which, admittedly, we’ve never heard of, but must be important because of all the letters—researchers found that 57 percent of British workers would be okay with their employers monitoring their fitness activity during work hours, as long as their nosy bosses paid for the tracker. However, just 5 percent of the survey participants said their current employer offers this benefit, so perhaps they were more apt to respond favorably to a hypothetical situation, and would change their tune if they knew their company CEO was creepin’ on their workout stats.
