Guy will have a more in-depth analysis over the media’s spaz attack later. \nI’ll just leave this insufferable exchange between former President Obama and the Chicago Tribune’s Christi Parsons after his 2012 re-elect win (via Newsbusters ): BARACK OBAMA: Christy Parsons? Hey.\nCHRISTI PARSONS (Chicago Tribune): Thank you, Mr. President. And congratulations, by the way. One quick follow-up– \nOBAMA: Thanks. Christi was there when I was running for state senate. \nPARSONS: That's right. I was! \nOBAMA: Christi and I go back a ways. \nPARSONS: I have never seen you lose. I wasn't looking that one time. \nOBAMA: There you go. \nAs Scott Whitlock mentioned, this is fan girl antics. The news media gushed over Obama for eight years, who also routinely ignored conservative news outlets. So, Trump ignores liberals and finally gives conservative ones some oxygen—and my god—they actually have something pertinent to ask. \nI think questions about Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are, well, much better than asking Trump what has enchanted him the most about serving as president. Jeff Zeleny, who was then working for The New York Times , threw that b each ball question at Obama in 2009 . Jeff Zeleny, NYT: During these first 100 days, what has surprised you the most about this office? Enchanted you the most from serving in this office? Humbled you the most? And troubled you the most?\nPresident Obama: \"Now let me write this down,\" the president quipped. He looked down at the podium. \"I've got...\" \nMr. Obama: \"I've got -- what was the first one?\" \nZeleny: \"Surprised.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:30:31.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
