dog who 'stopped mother from drowning her son' saved from being put down by petition \nThe petition to save Buddy secured more than 50,000 signatures Monday 6 March 2017 14:56 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online The council are working to micro chip and register the dog before returning it to the owner Twitter \nA pit bull thought to have saved a nine-year-old boy from drowning has been spared death after a petition went viral. \nThe dog, named Buddy, is believed to have dragged a nine-year-old boy from the Murray River in Australia as a mother allegedly attempted to drown him and his five-year-old brother. \nBut the pet allegedly bit the eldest boy and the mother, and after the confusing melee, was seized by rangers. \nPolice have ordered the dog to be returned to its owners after a GoPetition initiative, to rescue him from the threat of being killed, scooped more than 50,000 signatures. Hero dog saves owner from house fire by protecting woman from flames \n“It is likely that the dog was acting in reasonable defence of the nine-year-old boy that was subsequently hospitalised,” said Murray River Council interim general manager Margot Stork, in a statement. \n“The NSW Police have advised council that they will not be seeking an order to destroy this animal. Our Rangers are passionate about animal welfare and we will always work with residents to ensure their pets are registered, micro-chipped, and provide any advice or assistance.” \nMs Stork also added that the dog has since been micro chipped and that the dog’s owner will work on correctly registering it. 40,000 sign petition for Obama to be next President of France \nThe dog is thought to have intervened as a 27-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly tried to drown the nine-year-old in the Murray River in Moama, on the New South Wales-Victoria border late last week. A few days later the youngest boy’s body was found dead. \nThe woman has since been charged with murder and attempted murder. \nThe grandparents, who had custody of the children for nearly 18-months, have since accused authorities of failing to act since the mother was allegedly released from prison.
