Before the big game, she posted a photo of their daughter in a “Brady’s Little Ladies” shirt that took social media by storm. A photo posted by Gisele Bündchen (@gisele) on Feb 5, 2017 at 6:03am PST \nThe photo, captioned “#daddyslittlegirl,” has earned nearly half a million likes on Instagram in eight hours. \nA few hours later, Bundchen posted another photo of her squad in similar T-shirts. A photo posted by Gisele Bündchen (@gisele) on Feb 5, 2017 at 12:00pm PST \nHopefully for the Patriots, Vivian will prove to be a good luck charm yet again.
