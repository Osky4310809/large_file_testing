The light turned green for me to come this way and he kept going. He didn’t even brake to stop. He just kept going,” said SUV driver Noel Maldonado. “The only choice I had was to go in between those two – the pole and the tree – and I ended up in the store; in the pizza shop.” \n“And I say: ‘He’s going to hit you. He’s going to hit you,’ and he saw that, he said – he zoomed forward,” said passenger Deborah Felix. \nThe pizza parlor was open at the time. Workers inside suffered only minor injuries. \nThe pizza parlor workers were trapped inside briefly, but firefighters were able to get them out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T09:09:38.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
