Amazon has emerged as the central player in this movement after it released its voice-controlled home assistant Echo. And the tech giant made another very smart strategic move: It made the brains behind Echo—the natural-language AI Alexa— available to other companies to build into their products. At this year's CES, those devices and gadgets are everywhere. \nHere’s the full list of Alexa-powered products announced at CES 2017 so far, by category. Smart Home \nLenovo Smart Assistant Speaker \nThis is Lenovo’s version of Amazon’s Echo . Users will be able to use all the commands Echo users do. However, the Lenovo device comes in various colors and features a different microphone array design. Lenovo’s Smart Assistant has eight far-field microphones, compared to the Echo’s seven. \nLG Appliances \nLG said it’s put the Alexa brain inside its new InstaView smart refrigerator . While all Alexa functions will be enabled, users will also be able to use voice commands to re-order foods that are running low in the fridge. \nBelkin’s WeMo Dimmer Switch \nBelkin says users will be able to sync the WeMo Dimmer switch up with Alexa , as well as IFTTT, the Nest Learning Thermostat, and the Google Home smart speaker at its launch later this year. Same goes for the company's new, smaller, switch, the WeMo Mini . \nIncipio CommandKit Wi-Fi Light Switch \nIncipio released a $60 Wi-Fi-enabled light switch that customers can control using Alexa or Siri. \nWhirlpool Appliances \nWhirlpool said many of its smart appliances will respond to Alexa commands starting in \"early 2017.\" \nMattel's Aristotle \nMattel introduced Aristotle, a voice-activated baby monitor that answers both parents’ and kids’ questions. The speaker also comes with a wireless camera that streams 256-bit encrypted video to users’ phones. \nCoway Airmega Smart Air Purifier \nCoway has created an Alexa \"skill\" that allows users to tell the Airmega purifier to turn on, adjust temperature, or announce the air quality in the home. \nLinksys Velop \nVelop is integrating with Alexa to let basic router functions be completed by voice currently limited to turning the guest network on and off. Owners will also be able to ask Alexa to read their Wi-Fi password aloud. \nNightingale Nightingale said its smart sleep-aid system will work with Alexa once it starts shipping in February. Users will be able to tell Alexa to launch a goodnight scene, or adjust the brightness of the built-in nightlight. \nMattel's Aristotle \nMattel introduced Aristotle, a voice-activated baby monitor that answers both parents’ and kids’ questions. The speaker also comes with a wireless camera that streams 256-bit encrypted video to users’ phones. \nCoway Airmega Smart Air Purifier \nCoway has created an Alexa \"skill\" that allows users to tell the Airmega purifier to turn on, adjust temperature, or announce the air quality in the home. Ford offers Amazon Alexa [Photo: courtesy of Ford] In the Car \nFord Motor Co. \nFord is incorporating Alexa into its Ford Sync 3 service , which will allow Echo users to turn on their car with a voice command. They’ll also be able to lock or unlock doors, check fuel levels, and control IoT-enabled devices, such as home lights or a garage door. \nVolkswagen \nVolkswagen said it’s integrating Alexa with its Car-Net connected telematics services. So drivers will be able to speak commands like \"Alexa, ask Volkswagen the way to the nearest flower shop\" or \"Alexa, ask Volkswagen how much gas is left in the tank\" so users can determine if they’ll also need to fuel up along the way. \nINRIX The connected car analytics company INRIX said it will be integrating Alexa into its OpenCar platform . Huawei Mate 9 [Photo: courtesy of Huawei] Smartphone \nHuawei \nHuawei unveiled its Mate 9 smartphone , which it says is the the first to come with Alexa pre-installed. \nSensory \nSensory, the developer behind always-listening tech in devices like Samsung's Galaxy phones, says it’s bringing a new feature to Bluetooth headphones that will allow users to put Alexa in the ear (similar to how Apple has enabled Siri in its AirPod earphones). So users will be able to speak to their earphones to set alarms, make to-do lists, and get news and weather. TV \nDish \nDish said its customers will soon be able to control their TV with voice after pairing a Hopper DVR with the Amazon Echo or Echo Dot. DISH is the first pay TV provider to announce direct compatibility with Alexa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T03:50:29.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
