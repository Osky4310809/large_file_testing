Twitter Demi eventually responded to some of the rude comments, claiming she wasn’t sharing “old” news about her ancestry… Twitter …and she highlighted the fact that she included all of the nationalities in her genetic makeup, not just African. Demi Lovato also took a moment to let all her haters know they were mean AF for ragging on her DNA test results. Twitter Seriously, why does everyone have to be such a damn critic these days. @ddlovato Are people seriously freaking out about her being 1% African? Seriously, who gives a fuck besides people obsessed with race? pic.twitter.com/IeTIaom6UO \n— Mara Miller (@SaltyCLiberal) February 25, 2017 \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
