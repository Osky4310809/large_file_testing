(Representative Image: PTI) \nBSF today shot dead a Pakistani intruder ahead of the B S Fence in Punjab’s Gurdaspur, according to a report. BSF troops of border out post Paharipur thwarted a possible infiltration attempt this morning. The area has been cordoned off and search is on. Earlier in February BSF had shot dead a Pakistani intruder along the Indo-Pak International Border in Bamiyal sector, the same area from where terrorists had infiltrated last year to attack an IAF base. \nOfficials had said the Border Security Force observation post detected suspicious movements of an intruder at around 8:15 AM at about 50 metres from the IB fence. They said the troops challenged the intruder but seeing no response they fired, killing him on the spot. They said the body of the 21-year-old man, retrieved by the BSF after sometime, had no belongings, arms or ID card on it and the deceased wore a pathani suit. \nYou may also like to watch \n“We have handed over the body to local police,” BSF Inspector General (Punjab Frontier) Mukul Goyal said. Officials added the BSF also held a flag meeting with their counterparts Pak Rangers but they refused to accept the body saying the man did not belong to their country. The incident took place at the Simbal border post of the BSF in Bamiyal area of Pathankot. \nIn January last year, terrorists from across the border had infiltrated in the sector and went on to launch an audacious attack on the strategic Indian Air Force (IAF) base. \nLast month, a female Pakistani intruder was shot dead and another was arrested by the BSF when they tried to infiltrate into Indian territory along the International Border (IB) in different sectors of Jammu division. The female intruder was killed in the Pargwal sector of Akhnoor tehsil, a senior BSF officer said. He said the BSF men deployed on the IB challenged her to stop but when she did not pay heed to the warning, she was shot dead by the jawans. A meeting was also held with the Pakistan Rangers where they were shown the pictures of the deceased woman and they agreed to accept the body, the officer said. The body would be handed over to the Rangers. In the second incident, a Pakistani national moving in a suspicious manner near the border fence was arrested by the BSF in Kathua sector. \n(With agency inputs)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:15:09.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
