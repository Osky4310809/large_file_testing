Supposedly, Supreme shop employees were seen with red sportswear boxes from Nike containing red and white Dunk Highs.\nNaturally, a rumor of this sort was nothing new and most Supreme fans wrote it off as mere speculation. The claims were never substantiated by an official photo, only whispers on the web. Many dismissed them as the reported discovery was between seasons.\nSupreme x Nike has enjoyed a strong collaborative history in recent years, sending out remixed versions of everything from the Air Max 98 to the Air Force 1.\nNow, two years after the original rumor circulated, images of a possible sample have surfaced via MRBLD’s twitter , detailing a red and white Dunk High. The detailing reveals a quilted lining and Supreme tags on the uppers, while its red hue does echo the brand’s distinctive shade of red.\nCould they just be samples forwarded to friends and family ahead of a more robust collaboration between Nike and Supreme? Real or fake? Let us know what you think below.\nFor more footwear news, check out the leaked images of Nike’s new flyknit racer .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T10:44:21.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
