The Washington Post / Washington Post/Getty Images Share advertisement \nLong after the last SoundCloud downloads have succumbed to the second law of thermodynamics, and the final music CD has been digested by polycarbonate-eating bacteria, Chuck Berry will still be rocking. \nOr rather, his music will. \"Johnny B. Goode\" is graven onto the Golden Records now being carried ever deeper into the cosmos by the 1970s-era Voyager spacecraft. They only await an alien needle drop. \nYou might wonder why NASA chose to send old-timey analog platters into space. The answer can be learned by going back to 1971, when two employees of the agency, Eric Burgess and Richard Hoagland, noted that the upcoming Pioneer mission to scout out Jupiter and Saturn would send human-made hardware out of the solar system for the first time. \nThe two argued that these robotic emissaries should carry a message. So each was outfitted with a plaque about the size of a license plate, emblazoned with an image of a couple in nature's garb, and additional graphics with a few facts about Earth and its inhabitants. The Pioneer probes carried a gold plaque bearing a message designed by the American astronomer Carl Sagan. Information on the probe's origin and launch date and on human civilization was engraved on it, intended to be seen by beings who may intercept the probe outside the solar system thousands of years from now.

Consequently, when rockets for the Voyager mission were rolled onto Canaveral's concrete aprons in 1977, they too bore messages — this time in the form of analog records. A graphic on the spacecraft showed how to play these disks, lest any aliens were flummoxed by our Paleolithic recording technology. \nAstronomer Frank Drake, a participant in this project, says that grooved records were chosen because of the hostile environment in space. Once beyond Earth, cosmic rays will quickly erase any recording on magnetic tape — the only alternative to disks at the time. \nWhat about the message itself? Drake notes that the teams who selected the Golden Records' content — which included imagery, spoken word, text, sounds from nature, and music — were generally amiable and cooperative. All that is, except those tasked with deciding the music. They made a maddening fuss. Perhaps the musically trained are inherently combative, but it's also possible that our musical tastes are particularly close-held, and as hard to shake as a phone pole. \nIn any event, 26 short selections made the cut, including \"Johnny B. Goode.\" It's hard to know which genre the aliens will prefer (assuming they even know what music is), but one hopes they cotton to Beethoven. Unlike the others, he appears on the records twice.
