Yesterday, Mate 9 broke the Guinness World Record for the most selfies taken with different people in three minutes at the Palace Downtown Dubai. 160 high definition selfies were captured in 180 seconds with the iconic Burj Khalifa as a backdrop, which means nearly one click in one second. This record threw the previous one far away. Only Huawei Mate 9 can reach this speed. \nThe record breaking attempt took place at The Palace Hotel in Downtown Dubai, United Arab Emirates. As per the Guinness World Record guidelines, the image was a selfie taken by an individual using a smartphone or digital camera and was captured in exactly 180 seconds.

We’ve set international standards before and the attainment achieved in UAE makes it even more special for the Region. We’re proud to hold the Guinness World Record title and view this as a testament to the standard-setting work what we do on daily basis.” \nThe previous record held by Donnie Wahlberg and his fans on board the New Kids on the Block Cruise in the Gulf of Mexico featured 122 selfies in October 2016.
