I hope this guy, and we all know who he is, the guy is a just a whiner beyond belief,\" he said. \"You do this kind of stuff and I don't care who you are in the league, I don't care if you're the No. 1 player in the league, you should sit out a long time for this kind of crap. I really do.\" \nMethot's fingertip was chopped off and his entire finger bloodied as part of the gruesome injury, which didn't draw a penalty on Crosby. \nMelnyk added: \"The guy lost the top of his finger? Did you see it? It's ugly. I wouldn't want to show that to anybody under the age of 25.\" \nPierre LeBrun ‏ of ESPN.com reported the league isn't going to look into the incident for potential supplemental discipline either. \nSenators coach Guy Boucher confirmed Methot's finger is \"destroyed. It's shattered, and he's out for weeks,\" according to ESPN.com . The report included postgame comments from Crosby, who said it wasn't an intentional act. \n\"I was just trying to get his stick, and I think I caught his finger, judging by his reaction and their reaction,\" he said. \"I've gotten those before. They don't feel good.\" \nIt marked the second straight game Crosby was involved in a controversial incident. On Tuesday, he was caught on camera spearing the groin of Buffalo Sabres center Ryan O'Reilly from behind during the Pens' 3-1 victory over Buffalo at the First Niagara Center. \nSabres defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen received a three-game suspension for a separate play during the same game. Buffalo goaltender Robin Lehner said Friday \"certain teams in the league get the benefit of the doubt,\" per Heather Prusak of WGRZ: Robin Lehner is never afraid to speak his mind. Hear his thoughts on Rasmus Ristolainen's 3-game suspension. @WGRZ pic.twitter.com/jaQXLhakJc — Heather Prusak (@haprusak) March 24, 2017 \nCrosby, as the face of the NHL, is always going to receive more leeway. \nThat said, the league's decision to look the other way after two recent incidents is a dangerous precedent to set ahead of the more physical playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:58:02.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
