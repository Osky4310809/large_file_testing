Bongiovanni / West Deer tool company owner January 30, 2017 12:00 AM By Janice Crompton / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nFor Carl A. Bongiovanni, a well-lived life included close family ties, plenty of time for golf and sharing intangible life lessons. \nMr. Bongiovanni, a local business owner who “touched the life of everyone he met,” according to his wife, died of a heart attack on Thursday doing what he loved best — spending time with his newborn grandson in New York City. He was 59 and resided in Hampton. \nHe was the second-generation owner and president of Bon Tool Company, a contractor-grade tool manufacturer based in West Deer. \nThe company, with about 60 local employees, was founded by his father, Carl Bongiovanni, in 1958. The younger Carl Bongiovanni’s son, John, will take over operations at Bon Tool, which also has satellite locations in Henderson, Nev., and Chennai, India. \nJohn Bongiovanni, 31, had been serving as vice president of sales for the company, where he and his two younger sisters worked from an early age. His sisters no longer work for Bon Tool and John Bongiovanni thought he would have many more years to spend with his dad. \n“He used to always tell me, ‘Nobody knows this industry as well as I do. I’ve taught you everything you know, but not everything I know,’” John Bongiovanni said. \nCarl Bongiovanni is a 1975 graduate of Fox Chapel Area High School, where he served as quarterback of the football team. He went to college at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics and history in 1979. \nWhen his children were growing up, Mr. Bongiovanni was best known as the neighborhood Santa and the dad who dispensed wisdom from his front porch, where he spent many summer evenings. \n“He was a father figure, not just to his own kids but to his friends’ kids,” said his wife Jean, whom he married on Nov. 3, 1984. “The kids all loved their front porch lectures. He led by example. \n“He was generous, humble, a good listener and he had good advice,” said Mrs. Bongiovanni, who said her husband also valued his hobbies, which included clearing bittersweet vines from the woods near their house. \nHe was so serious about eliminating the invasive vines that choke and kill trees that the family jokingly nicknamed him “machete man,” she said. \n“He would take a machete into the woods and spend hours chopping, even in the winter,” Mrs. Bongiovanni said. “He was there day after day, and he was very proud of the fact that he was saving all those trees.” \nMr. Bongiovanni also cherished walks in the woods with the family’s yellow Labrador retriever, Buoy, who died several months ago, and he was an avid golfer with a five-hole putting green in his basement. \n“The Pittsburgh Field Club was his home away from home,” said Mrs. Bongiovanni, who said her husband also was active at the Duquesne Club and with the Young Presidents’ Organization/​World Presidents’ Organization. \nHis daughter Emily, 23, of Denver said her dad valued the little joys in life, such as identifying birds with his binoculars on the front porch or watching “60 Minutes” every Sunday with his children. \n“My dad wanted to make sure we were the most well-rounded children,” Emily Bongiovanni said. “He was always about expanding your mind and understanding other people.” \nJohn Bongiovanni said he is grateful for all of the lessons he learned from his father and hopes to carry on in his example. \n“In his peculiar way, he prepared me, my mom and my sisters in case a moment like this ever happened,” John Bongiovanni said. “He made us ready for it and now it’s time for us to keep up his legacy and remember everything he’s taught us.” \nMr. Bongiovanni also is survived by his parents, Carl and Natalie Bongiovanni of Oakmont, daughter Dana Werner of New York City, sisters Michele Bender of O’Hara and Paula Wight of Fox Chapel and two grandsons. \nVisitation will be held Thursday from 1-3 and 5-7 p.m. at Neely Funeral Home, 2208 Mount Royal Blvd., Shaler. A Mass of Christian Burial is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Friday at St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church, 2510 Middle Road, Hampton. \nIn lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations to Pittsburgh North Optimist Foundation, 208 9th Street, Aspinwall, Pa. 15215. \nJanice Crompton: jcrompton@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1159 or on Twitter @janicecrompton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T07:23:04.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
