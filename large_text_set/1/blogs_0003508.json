Several Hall of Famers thanked DDP for the program and for him helping them recover from their addiction of all sorts and to get them back in shape and in all-around improved health. Such notable names are Scott Hall and Jake \"the Snake\" Roberts, which both were documented in the Roberts documentary last year. \nDDP's wrestling resume isn't too bad, either. A three-time WCW World Champion, United States Champion, Television Champion, and Tag Team Champion, Page is the fourth WCW Triple Crown Champion (behind the likes of Ric Flair, Lex Luger, and Sting). While his WWE career was cut short in 2002 due to nagging injuries, Page would make sporadic appearances on WWE programs, even appearing at WrestleMania 32 in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royale. \nThough not officially confirmed yet by WWE, they should start rolling out names in the next few weeks or so in time for WrestleMania Weekend and the Hall of Fame ceremony itself. For his work outside the ring being exponentially more important than his in-ring career, Page definitely deserves a place in this professional wrestling pantheon. \n(H/t: PWInsider)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:46:01.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
