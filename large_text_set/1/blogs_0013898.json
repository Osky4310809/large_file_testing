Paper Kite made an offer and sealed the deal a couple of weeks ago. \nWhen her agent set up a call with Paper Kite last month, Poehler was on the line. \"I won't lie - I cried,\" Mathieu said. \"Not on the phone - I kept it together - but I cried after the phone call. She is such an idol of mine.\" \nPoehler, she said, is \"to me, a model of what it means to be a strong, smart creative woman who stands up for other women.\" \nThat's one reason Mathieu is thrilled to have Poehler involved with \"Moxie.\" The book doesn't soft-sell its feminist message. It's set in a Texas high school, where the girls are sick of sexist rules and dress codes, harassment in the hallways and the football players being treated like little kings. Together, they figure out how to stand up for themselves and each other. \n\"I don't write stories to lecture kids,\" Mathieu said, and her books aren't designed to teach lessons. \"But I'd be lying if I didn't also say that I hope this book will serve as an entry point for some young readers to explore the idea of gender equality.\" \nMathieu, 40, drew from some of her own memories of '90s-era Riot Grrrl feminism. \"We were having so much fun and we were so free,\" she said, building fierce friendships and rocking out at Sleater-Kinney concerts. In her early twenties Mathieu published a zine, assembling each issue with clip art and rubber cement and making copies at a Kinko's. \n\"Feminism has brought a lot of joy to my life,\" Mathieu said. \"It's enhanced my relationships, helped me stand up for myself.\" \nNow she sees it as more important than ever. \"The language that was used in the presidential election is just shocking to me,\" Mathieu said, but the problem goes beyond that; language that dismisses, reduces and insults women is \"pervasive in all parts of our culture.\" When she looks at her 15- and 16-year-old students, she said, \"I am so worried that they're going to come of age thinking that that language is in any way normal. It's not normal or OK.\" \nPaper Kite is behind Comedy Central's \"Broad City\" and the Hulu show \"Difficult People.\" \nOn that phone call in December, Poehler was quoting her favorite lines from the manuscript, Mathieu said. \"She really got what I was trying to say with the book, and she kept saying she would want to protect the story.\" \nRoaring Brook Press will publish \"Moxie\" Sept. 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:48:45.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
