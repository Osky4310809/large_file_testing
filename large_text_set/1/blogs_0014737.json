He pointed out he answered a French question in English at a recent town hall meeting in Peterborough, Ont.\nBut Trudeau changed his tune a few minutes later when a reporter revisited the topic.\nAsked whether the English-speaking people in the audience Tuesday night did not deserve to understand him, he replied: “I understand how important it is in these public meetings to be able to answer questions about people’s concerns.\n“So, yes, I maybe could have answered partly in English and partly in French and, on reflection, it would have been a good thing to do,” he said.\nRelated A question in English about service in English in Quebec — and Trudeau replies in French Say that again? Unintended zingers from Trudeau ’s national listening tour About 80 per cent of Quebecers report French as their mother tongue, with most English-speakers concentrated in the Montreal area.\nIt is customary for political speeches in Quebec to be mostly in French, while it is generally accepted that francophone reporters get to ask their questions first at news conferences.\nOther than being briefly booed for speaking English at a Fête nationale celebration in Quebec City last year, the fluently bilingual Trudeau has thus far largely avoided the language controversies that have dogged previous prime ministers, including his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau.\nHis party made strong gains in Quebec in the 2015 election, winning 40 of the province’s 78 seats. Many ridings with a high percentage of French-speaking voters still remain out of reach for the Liberals, who fare well in areas with significant anglophone representation.\nBut on Wednesday, Trudeau faced rare heat from some members of that English-speaking community.\nJudy Ross, the woman who asked Trudeau the question about mental health, said she “felt disrespected” when he explained why he would answer only in French.\n“I was so disappointed that by the time he got through that bit of fantasy land, I really didn’t take in the rest,” Ross said in an interview. “I was too miffed.\n“It (mental health) is a topic that’s very difficult to explain and express in your own language, let alone a second language. Even people who are bilingual prefer to have their services in their mother tongue. And I thought, with his life experience, he would be sensitive to that.”\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during a town hall meeting Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017 in Sherbrooke, Quebec. The president of an association representing anglophones in the province’s Eastern Townships said Trudeau should apologize to the English-speaking community.\nGerald Cutting said the prime minister’s refusal to use both languages undermined the anglophone community’s long struggle to obtain access to services in their own language.\n“There were people in that audience who felt they were demoted to second-class citizens, and that needs to be addressed,” he said in an interview.\nHe said Trudeau’s attempt to moderate his stance Wednesday was insufficient and that he should meet with members of the anglophone community to clarify his remarks.\nAnother organization, the Quebec Community Groups Network, also called for an apology.\n“The QCGN cannot imagine the prime minister or any other bilingual politician replying in English to a French question posed in New Brunswick, Manitoba or any other province where the main language is English,” said president James Shea.\n“Even staunch defenders of the French language like (former Parti Québécois premier) Rene Lévesque would never have made such a misstep.”\nThe prime minister’s actions did find an unlikely defender, however, in the president of the sovereigntist Societe Saint-Jean-Baptiste, who said Trudeau initially showed the right instincts before modifying his position Wednesday.\n“But the prime minister didn’t commit to it all the way, since he backtracked a few hours later.”\n– With files from Vicky Fragasso-Marquis \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T08:30:33.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
