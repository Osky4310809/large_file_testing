The “Jeopardy!”/ “8 Mile” mashup video we’ve waited a millennium for. \nAlex Trebek rapped a few bars of “Famous” by Kanye West on “Jeopardy!” and I am convinced I never want to listen to another chunk of audio ever again. \nIf I had it my way, I would make all music illegal that doesn’t in some way feature T-Money dropping “They mad they ain’t famous / They mad they’re still nameless… But we still hood famous / Yeah we still hood famous” like he was talking about 16th century romance literature. “What is last name ever / First name greatest / Like a sprained ankle boy I ain’t nothing to play with?” Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek raps popular lyrics from Kanye to Drake To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nThat’s all A-Bek The Rapper reading clues off a “Let’s Rap, Kids!” category during Sunday night’s episode, in which he read lyrics from Kendrick Lamar , Drake , Desiigner, Kanye West , Lil Wayne and a few others. Are these videos the best thing on the internet? Here's Alex Trebek rapping Desiigner's \"Panda\" on #Jeopardy tonight hahaha pic.twitter.com/XBeeRGRB25 \n— Matt Zampini (@Matt_Zamp) February 21, 2017 Tre Ball McQuestionnaire saying “6′,7′,8′ bunch Young Money militia and I am the commissioner you don’t want start Weezy, ’cause the F is for Finisher” is all you need to get over this post-Presidents’ Day work week. There's a rap category on Jeopardy, and Alex Trebek's got BARS. pic.twitter.com/W5NGCBREdf \n— Justin Ferguson (@JFergusonAU) February 21, 2017 YESSSS, PRAISE CHRIST THE INTERNET BECAME AWARE OF THIS. I took Alex Trebek rapping on Jeopardy and did the only thing that felt right: Edit it to the music he was quoting.

I’m not too good at it, but I was getting into it. \nThis isn’t the first time Tre-Dawg has gotten behind the mic to spit a little on the “Jeopardy!” stage. \nLast year, he made the entire internet pause and reflect for a few moments when he sang a few bars off “Jumpman” by Drake .

The one saving grace, though, is Lexalicious Trizzle Bizzle is primed and ready for a mixtape to drop any day now. \n  CITATIONS Mashable Mashable", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:34:01.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
