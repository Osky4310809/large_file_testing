Mark Dayton announced Tuesday that he will undergo surgery to remove his prostate next month. \nThe Democratic governor said his prostatectomy is slated for March 2 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Following the operation, Dayton said he will likely spend one night in the hospital before getting back into contact with this staff. \nLast month, Dayton told Minnesotans that he had been recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. The announcement came after he collapsed during his state of the state address. \nIn his Tuesday surgery announcement, which was posted on Facebook, the governor said that recent tests showed no signs that his cancer had spread. \nProstate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, according to the American Cancer Society.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T19:14:48.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
