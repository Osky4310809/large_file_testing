Such payments would include income from Trump hotel guests and office building leases, the report stated. \nHowever, other legal experts have said that a lawsuit of this nature would not amount to a violation of the Constitution as payments made by foreign governments are not paid to President Trump directly but to a corporate entity, the Times said. \nRead the full New York Times report here . \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:42:33.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
