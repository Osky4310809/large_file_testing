Raiders to return south. They’ll stay in Oakland at least through the 2017 season and have another one-year option at the Oakland Coliseum, which could keep them there another year. Owner Mark Davis says that he plans on staying for those two years.

They will share the venue with UNLV. \nThe Raiders have a storied history with Hip Hop, especially when they were in Los Angeles. After winning two Super Bowls in Oakland, the team moved to the City of Angels in 1982 where they won their third title a year later, dividing the country with owner Al Davis, head coach John Madden, running back Marcus Allen and wide receiver Tim Brown. Embed from Getty Images \nDavis’ infamous saying, “Just Win Baby, Win” is used by Snoop Dogg in DJ Khaled’s “All I Do Is Win” and, in the team’s heyday, N.W.A helped unify the Raiders with Hip Hop, wearing the team’s gear and matching the squad’s flagrant attitude. \nEven Jay Z changed the colors of the Nets when the team moved to Brooklyn from red and blue to black and white, acknowledging the power of the colors.
