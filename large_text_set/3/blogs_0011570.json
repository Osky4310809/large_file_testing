The sequel, The Girl in the Spider’s Web , is still in early stages — casting. Obviously, the most important thing to us about this casting process is that they get the right Lisbeth Salander, because she’s a tricky woman to embody . Fede Álvarez, the director tasked with The Girl in the Spider’s Web , recently talked to Variety about his excitement for the project and process.\n“I’m hugely excited and grateful for this opportunity,” Álvarez said. “Sony has become family to me and I can’t think of a more thrilling project to celebrate our relationship. Lisbeth Salander is the kind of character any director dreams of bringing to life. We’ve got a great script and now comes the most fun part — finding our Lisbeth.” According to some mysterious ~insiders~ in the industry, both Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson are in the running. The two previously starred together in another powerful woman-heavy film, The Other Boleyn Girl . Honestly, in a competition between the two, we’re not NEARLY sure who we’d want to win.\nWe’d totally trust Natalie Portman, who only ever turns in performances we love, to become Lisbeth in the sequel. She’s smart, intense, and after watching her kick ass in films like Black Swan and V for Vendetta , we could totally see it.\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin/ Getty Images But we could also see Scarlett Johansson (with her background in Black Widow badassery) killing it, too.
