Starting from the coach, incapable of resolving the team's problems. Luis Enrique did not prepare the game well and didn't have solutions from the bench. The thrashing is one that will be remembered and he is the main one responsible for it as the coach admitted after the game.\" \nAS: A complete write-off. - AS (@diarioas) February 15, 2017 \nAlfredo Relano in his AS column wrote : \"No one could have expected something like this. PSG showed itself finally to be a well constructed team under Emery, formed around a great Rabiot, with energetic, calm, technical, well organised and generous players. Barca, with Busquets and Iniesta out of form and frustrating Andre Gomes, were no match. This time the attack did not save the team, Neymar was the exception and one could say that he played against X. Messi had his worst game at Barca. It was something like the 'St. Valentine slaughter. Barca against the wall and machine-gunned... The four goals was the adequate difference between the two teams, it leaves Barca tumbled and it lifts PSG to title contenders. A glorious night for Unai Emery.\" \nDiario Sport: This is not Barca. - MESSISTATS ���� (@MessiStats_) February 15, 2017 \nToni Frieros wrote on Sport: \"A complete disaster personified by the captain, Andres Iniesta, who had one of his worst games as a Barcelona player. Returning to the starting XI, he did not only not distribute the game that he would have had to but was one of the men that gave the most balls away. His slowness and lack of intensity that Iniesta showed was a rock that weighed too much for the collective play of the team.\" \nEl Mundo Deportivo: Disaster. \nSanti Nolla wrote in El Mundo Deportivo : \"It was a very hard blow for Barca fans that had placed their confidence in extraordinary players. Yesterday, Barca supporters experienced a nightmare that has left them practically out of Europe, waiting for more than a courageous act, a miracle in the return leg at the Camp Nou.\" \nThe French media had fun also. French newspapers this morning. \"Prodigious\" for L'Equipe. \"Magical\" for Le Parisien pic.twitter.com/iNxtNwHcyI \nL'Equipe: Prodigious. \n\"An extraordinary Parisian display yesterday against Barca. PSG, who will travel to Barcelona on March 8, are almost certain of qualifying for the quarter-finals. The Parc des Princes saw everything and even things it would never have dared to think up in its wildest dreams: Kimpembe who extinguished Suarez, Rabiot who walked over Messi for the whole match, Nkunku who allowed himself a double drag back in front of Busquets five minutes after coming on, Pastore who played football again without getting injured and above all Paris Saint-Germain who smacked the Barcelona of the MSN (Messi, Suarez, Neymar) four times and is almost blocking their route to the Champions League quarter-finals, something that has not happened since 2007.\" Fairly confident this is the first time @lequipe has given Messi 2/10 pic.twitter.com/kEemsa1P7k \nLe Parisien: Magic! \n\"Thanks to a perfect match, the Parisians torpedoed the Barcelona armada. The doors to the Champions League quarter-finals are wide open. It's like a dream come true, a Christmas present delivered late, a huge gift which comes to take its place in the legend of a club that wasn't born with Qatar but which had its best match before or after the qualification, 2-2 with 10 men against 11 and during extra-time, against Chelsea in the last 16 in 2015.\" \nAdriana Garcia and Mark Rodden contributed to this report. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:52:10.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
