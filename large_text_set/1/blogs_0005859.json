A few hours after LG announced its own version of the appliance complete with a built-in Alexa voice functionality. \nThis time out, the company is bringing the functionality to a wide range of different fridge configurations, including two, three and four door models, so users looking for the functionality aren’t stuck with a single model. \nThe primary unit features a 21.5-inch LED touchscreen that serves a digital bulletin board for handwritten memos, grocery purchasing through Mastercard and instant recipes via AllRecipes. There’s also built in media streaming courtesy of partnerships with IHeartRadio and Spotify. \nThe 2.0 version features voice commands for some Echo-like functionality like checking the weather an time, though Samsung looks to be working in-house for this one – no big surprise, given the fact that the company is said to be building a custom AI offering for its line of Galaxy products. If it succeeds, it shouldn’t be too long before it arrives on the company’s connected home appliances. \nAs with LG, the company clearly sees these appliances as method for setting the ground work for its own play in the fully connected smart home space. \nPricing and availability is still forthcoming.
