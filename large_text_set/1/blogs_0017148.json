Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nReality stars are on a mission to prove that Jodie Marsh isn't \"classy\" after she made a dig at them online. \nThe former glamour model has been targeted by people like Love Island 's Olivia Buckland and Thomas Powell after she suggested the public was done with reality shows. \nIt all started when Geordie Shore 's Chloe Ferry was evicted from Celebrity Big Brother on Friday night. \nAfter host Emma Willis pointed out that other Geordie Shore stars - Scott Timlin and Charlotte Crosby - had won the Channel 5 show, Jodie took to Twitter to share her views.

Jodie once posed naked in the gym (Photo: jodiemarshtv/instagram) \n\"And as someone who in the past has done a fair few embarrassing things on TV, you know it's not cool when even I can't watch it. \n\"RIP Geordie Shore, Love Island & Ex On the Beach. You had a good run but your time is up. The public have spoken & they want classy!\" \nBut now, a host of reality stars have hit back. \nOlivia Buckland, who appeared on Love Island , quoted one of Jodie's tweet, adding: \"LOL. is someone bitter?\" Olivia Buckland hit out at Jodie (Photo: Hair Rehab London) A host of 'unclassy' pics of Jodie have resurfaced online (Photo: jodiemarshtv/instagram) \nShe added: \"Sitting on your high horse when you have no right to do so. How can you tweet about equality straight after slating others for life choices? \n\"If u choose equality for race & gender u chose it for sexuality, you chose it for people having freedom to be themselves and not be judged.\" \nShe later added that Jodie had blocked both her and her fiancé Alex Bowen. Jodie says she would never have sex on TV (Photo: Instagram/jodiemarshtv) \nShe wrote: \"Ok so me and @ab_bowen07 have just been blocked. @LoveIsland is our baby and I will stick up for it forever. Hey it found me my fiancé! \n\"Not only is @ LoveIsland my Bae. I [heart] reality TV. I love REALNESS. I love raw personalities. I hate judgemental people. Respect the hustle xx\" \nGeordie Shore's Scott ' Scotty T ' Timlin - who has also appeared on Ex On The Beach - also joined the online feud. Scotty T had something to say too (Photo: Splash) She says she isn't ashamed of the skimpy outfits she's worn in the past (Photo: PA/Rex/Shutterstock) \nAlongside a series of pictures of Jodie, he wrote: \"Proper legend.... H Ps what's going on with your toes in the last pic \" \nHe was also later blocked by Jodie. \nLove Island's Thomas Powell tweeted pictures of Jodie, and said: \"Oi reality tv stars.. let's take a leaf out of @JodieMarsh book and keep it classy aye...\" \nHe later tweeted a screenshot showing that Jodie had blocked him. \nGeordie Shore and Ex On The Beach star Aaron Chalmers also joined the argument. Aaron Chalmers got involved too (Photo: ITV) \nHe tweeted Jodie, saying: \"What shows could these be? Like you being a body builder? Or a tattooist? Or finding a man and marrying him? I agree \" \nJodie didn't let them get away with it though. Jodie says you can't undo having sex on TV (Photo: Getty) \nShe hit back at them, writing: \" ps I think I \"may\" have upset some of the people that have had sex on TV \n\"The thing is, once you've been seen shagging on TV, you can never undo that. Your future kids may see it. Your parents have probably seen it \n\"And if you're cool with that, then fine. I just don't think in the long run it'll serve you well. But hey, do what you want \n\"And I speak from experience. I've never had sex on TV but I've defo done things that I'm not proud of. We all have. But SEX ON TV??!! #bad\" \nShe later added: \"W everyone who has ever had sex on TV is coming for me. They are clearly very upset. Listen guys, it's cool. You're unpaid Porn stars!\" Jodie has worn belts for a top a few times (Photo: Rex/Shutterstock) \nShe continued to defend herself online. \nWhen someone tweeted about the time she went out covering her modesty with nothing but a pair of belts, Jodie responded: \"Yes cos going out to a nightclub in a skimpy outfit is EXACTLY the same as having sex on TV for the whole country to see \" \nJodie also said: \"All the geordie people tweeting me pics of me wearing skimpy outfits: carry on!! I'm not ashamed I wore a skimpy outfit or two.... \n\" but mark my words; you WILL one day be ashamed that you had sex on TV.
