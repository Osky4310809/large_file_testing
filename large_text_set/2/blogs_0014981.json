You look at what’s happening … We’ve gotta keep our country safe,” Trump repeated while basking in applause from supporters. “You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Who would believe this?”\n\nWell, not Sweden! Or anyone else who has their guard up after the Trump administration’s Bowling Green Massacre and Atlanta misfires. Carl Bildt, former Prime Minister of Sweden, was quick to chime in.\nSweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound. https://t.co/XWgw8Fz7tj \n— Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) February 19, 2017 \n\nOthers directly fed into the comment, showing just how dangerous it was.\nPresident Trump please build those Safe Zones quickly !! We cannot & will not become Sweden, France etc etc!!! pic.twitter.com/72ejdzMiqo \n— Debbie B. (@mypupcocobear) February 18, 2017 \n\nAnd while there was plenty of harsh criticism thrown Trump’s way, it didn’t take long for the conversation to devolve into Swedish Chef jokes.\nJournalist at one of #Sweden 's newspapers & people in their newsroom have no idea what Trump is talking about.Nothing happened. #TrumpRally https://t.co/8Gnz8oRhGH \n— Wolfgang ️ (@Golden_Gaytime) February 18, 2017 \nConway makes up Bowling Green Massacre. Spicer makes up attack in Atlanta. Trump makes up attack in Sweden.
