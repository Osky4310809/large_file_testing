PUNCH will not stop to amaze people with their undue sensationalism. How many members do we have in the House of Reps. How many are PDP members and how many are APC members?. I do not think that the 37 PDP defected members would make much difference. PDP is a mega party any day, any time and these people defecting now will still return to PDP just like their God-father Atiku is now set to join the APC but will still return after he has lost again. We know them all and their antics are not new. God bless Nigeria \n37 members will make no difference? you are a joker or you typed from india tonto \ndont mind him, na ogogoro talk. Magic \nGoverment in Nigeria is so attractive,and dangerously lucrative ,…the day u become a councilor u turn to a semi god…with this trend,we are going no where as a nation…. Adewale Ogungbe \nOnce upon a time a nation gather to celebrate his independence, everybody were singing and rejoicing infact there was total jubilation, after some years the story turn to war,envy,fight,greediness and the rest. guess what nation is that. I hope the jubilation of the so called PDP moving APC will not soon turn to that. please mr and mrs defectors go out right there and do the purpose of your defection. GOD BLESS NIGERIA AMEN. \nThat is a case of Cry in Freetown which indeed became NOT FREE but Blood Diamond! Tunji Daniels \nwhilst the defections from PDP to APC may be welcomed in some quarters and in the context of Nigerian democracy, a positive news; the politics in Nigeria is not principled based and as such there may still be no progress to the overall civic, social, economic and general good of Nigerians at the street level. \nUntil Nigerian politicians become principle based: left or right on centrist, the political bastardisation will continue, unfortunately. In the same manner a large number of fellow Nigerians are bigots and can’t see beyond tribe, ethnicity and religion as opposed to the common good of all Nigerians. Therefore, most Nigerian politicians find it easier to ride on the back of the bigotry to power and do as they like. \nThe question then is how do we move forward? how do we change from this seemingly never ending loop of bigotry and ineptitude? from the sham of politicians and gullible electorate to a more vibrant, responsible and principles based popular democracy? It wouldn’t be easy and certainly business as usual will not lead the desired changes. Plumsole \nBro, are you high on something? Did you write the first comment or someone else? Because if you are talking of bigots, tribe and ethnicity, and you wrotethe first comment, you need to visit a psychiatrist. Okobi Chika \nLet them defect and jubilate.But we people of the Niger Delta have the real trump card. We have the strings attached to their purses.If these Hausa/Fulani and Yoruba conspiracy against Uncle Joe,the President continues,the boys will return to the creeks and shut down the economic life-line of this fucking moribund country called Nigeria. On circumspection those “one Nigerian” parasites ought to be wary of ruffling the feathers of their golden goose that lays their golden egg. This is 2013 not 1960s and besides neither the British nor the Soviets (which is nomore) will raise their fingers to assist in yet another genocide to keep this Fucking Nigeria, one.Nigeria to the world community is an eye-shore and a disgrace to our entire black race. \nBut then the hands of God seem to be in in play here.The true living God wants us to go our separate ways without blood-shed.The muslim North,the pagan West and the \nrest of Christian East with the Middle Belt must go their separate way now. Beejay \nOkobi, stop deceiving yourself. If you like go and start drinking your oil. You the south south people are the ones that will suffer it most. Let me remind you that before the emegence of oil, Nigeria had been existing and it was even more peaceful. Go and inquire from your uncles who were old enough to know what was happening then. If you seize the oil pipeline, then the country will face Agriculture and it will be better for the country. Good luck to you. Man_Enough \nSHUT DOWN. WE WILL ALL FEEL THE PINCH. Justice \n“PDP, POWER; PDP POWER”. I think the leaders of this Poverty Developing Party are so Power-drunk they cannot see the implication and far-reaching effects of current political developments. Those who crucified Jesus Christ had no idea or understanding of their actions. History is being carved out right before our very eyes and the major players can’t see it. Blinded by their own selfishness and greed. Never in the history of modern Nigeria has five Governors defected from a ruling party. Never has MP’s of a ruling party defected! It should be the other way round in a sane clime. And no one is paying attention, yet! “Let them go, we don’t need them, they are traitors, anyway”. Incredible! Anyone remember the story of the prodigal son? There is no father/leader worth his salt that will allow his son/follower to desert the family. Unless you never loved him. And when some of us say that GEJ is clueless, not intellectually capable of running the affairs of this great nation, some myopic, ignorant people abuse us. I don’t care where you have come from in Nigeria, I just want the best leadership. I have spent 25 years abroad, I just want to return home to my fatherland before I become too old to enjoy what I am missing here. And I cannot do so while these nonentities are ruining the affairs of the nation and plundering our collective wealth. “PDP POWER? Indeed!!!” KJB \nGood luck to Good-luck! the nightmare have gradually become reality. lets see what the trained snipers can do to this our hard fought democracy. Nigeria is on the verge of rescue! casmir imo \nby tomorrow we shall hear from those that will defect from APC to PDP. No celebration yet. JadyPepper \nDream on, Mr Dreamer! Dreams don’t cost you a penny! bakos \nwhy don’t u give us their names (defectors)? bias publisher. PDP will win in 2015 no matter whatever show the vilain will put forth, the hero will always conquer at last. TRUTH MASTER \nYou liken PDP to a hero? Really? What a perversed generation!!! bakos \nYes, perverse, It is only those who don’t have a name and traitors like obj that are perverse. Please try to give u self a name, very very important, brother. TRUTH MASTER \nPlease squeeze out a little change to buy some papers this morning…so you can read the names of the defectors. That is if you did not watch Wednesday’s nightly news. Sam \nI appreciate everyone’s comment. But the question is if a snake changes it’s skin will it not still remain a snake? Let’s see what the end will bring. Greg \nI dont trust all these politicians. They will move back to pdp once they sort out their differences. No ideology in Nigerian politics. Nobody stands for anything. All of them are interested in their personal ambitions otherwise what have they achieved in the house. If they have the country at heart, they should impeach GEJ if he is not performing. Unfortunately the supposed guards of the masses is home of corruption. Is Faruk Lawal among the defectors? Am just worried about my country Babs \nIt is left to be seen whether these defecting Reps shall be returned in the next general elections. Nigerians are wiser now and will not vote those who stole their constituency allowance. I wish APC luck. 100%Iboguy \nSingling out APC defectors is funny. Ahmed \nAPC is joking, Defecting to another party can not cure the Nigerian problems. The question is those that has defected, what impact has they make in that house of reps? The answer is “NO IMPACT” Because defected Reps are just there to answer YES SIR ! YES SIR to their Governers or godfathers. WHAT NIGERIAN NEEDED IS THEIR GOOD IMPACT not this news of defection every way. This man called GEJ still has the power as the president of Nigeria, so their defection make nothing because even if APC has the upper hand in the House, It will be very IMPOSSIBLE to unseat GEJ. If that happen then we see greater problems in Nigeria because what Nigerians need is peace & unity not WAR. Dr Pat Kolawole Awosan \nThe fact is that every political party calves out its own manifesto to present to the populace what it intend to implement,achieve for the masses if voted into public office,as a contract with the people of Nigeria. Whether state governors defected or lawmakers defected from the do-nothing-corruption-ridden,ineptitude and non-focus PDP majority in the senate and house of representatives,the fact is lawmakers and state governors along with the capable,competent and transparent good-thinking president, would work toward implementation and completion of their political party manifesto,,for the good of the people of Nigeria. okey Ezelue \nThis political scenario portrays GEJ as a resolute leader…He believes in himself and have furnish by his maker with most of the tenets of a Democrat.For instance the allowance for a conducive environment for opposition to come up.its healthy and encourages political culture with reference to participation in politics by Nigerians.. GEJ is already a nationalist in the making.Here is what a level playing ground is called though the APC have more crook and desperado to do black magic.. DO NOT BE TOO SURPRISED IN 2015.mind you all is doing his permutation. Kalitaaruku \nI m not ready to judge which party is good or bad, all i am sure of is that a balanced democracy between two strong parties is good for nigeria olaola13 \nThis could be the beginning of a new dawn for Nigeria. If the APC turn out to be as bad as PDP then we can vote them out. Doing the same thing for 14 years and expecting a different result is sheer insanity. It’s time to try a different approach. Another benefit is that having two strong parties will put however is in govt in check and on their toes. The present status of one dominating party is one of the main reasons why PDP think they can do whatever they want and still win. We need serious checks and balances. Caesar \nWell, there is no fuss for now. Most of them are not returning to the house come 2015 and for everyone of them that left PDP, there is equally someone stronger than they are in the PDP in their constituency to wrestle power from them come 2015. BTW, for anyone talking about impeaching the President, I do not think you know how cumbersome it is to impeach the president of this country according to our constitution so chill, no cause for alarm there. It is not even only up to the Rep to even contemplate Guest \nWell, there is no fuss for now.

Very soon the hands will be that of APC but the Voice is that of PDP.Good/bad luck to you. chudi \nSimple mathematics: 37 self-representative members = 37 Votes ivory abiola \nThe constitution is straight on this, they have to go and seek a new mandate from their constituency. The truth also is that 2015 is gping to be a mirage Akaawka \nPlease, someone should tell me the difference between APC and PDP! kingsley \nNot for NIGERIA but for their personal interest. DIKE \nthose house of reps knows that they will not make it in 2015 because PDP will not give them return ticket. defecting to APC is their best option to seek for another term. 100%Iboguy \nI think you are a great thinker to have seen why the move to ACP might have been the most sensible thing to do if your assertion that there is a hidden god in PDP who dishes out return ticket is true. DIKE \nthere is no hidden plan but those people have served more than two term so they have to give other people chance to serve. JJC \nPDP MAY SOON GO TO COURT TO DECLARE THEIR SEAT VACANT IN LINE WITH THE CONSTITUTION. I HOPE THEY ARE READY TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES? \nI ALSO BELIEVE THAT HAVE DEFECTED FROM THE PDP TO APC SO FAR ARE NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE PDP TO LOST IN 2015 UNDER A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION, EXCEPT YOU ARE SAYING THAT APC WILL RIG THE ELECTION. \nIF PDP WINS IN 2015 UNDER A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION, I HOPE MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMENTING WILL NOT CRY OF RIGGING? NOTE ELECTIONS ARE NOT WON ON THE PAGES OF NEWSPAPER AND PROPAGANDA. PDP IS A WELL ORGANIZED AND FORMIDABLE PARTY. YOU WILL REMEMBER I TOLD YOU. Bosso \nYou must be blind not have seen or read the legal backing from the constitution that gave them the authority to switch parties. Are you and your pdp desperadoes going to enact your own laws or simply hire a paid judge to declare their seats vacant ??? Losers. Bosso \nThe list of those to be killed by Jonathan hired killers keeps growing. Get ready to kill everyone until only you and Tukur remain alive. Abacha re-incarnate Edo man \nIf anyone thinks that a party(APC) wooing Atiku is the miracle workering party in the horizon, then they better think again. APC goal is to move to the center and nothing more. Peter \nThank you sir. I share your sentiments. It is time to look beyond these politicians and rebrand our country the way the youth have done in the past 7 years through nollywood and sports. We can do it if we clean up our individual act and create an environment of success for our selves. Mr Igbo Sanity \nA man who CANNOT keep his WORD is a COCKROACH! jona’s failure to keep his WORD to OBJ, to Northern Governors, to Nigeria NOT to seek 3rd term has its CONSEQUENCES! As jona makes his BED so must he lye on it. \nThis is ONLY the beginning! By the time the dust has settled, 108 pdp house of rep members and 40 pdp senators would have dumped the largest FRAUDULENT party in the WORLD, THE pdp! 99% Citizens R Corrupt, +U \nUseless Nigerian politics, no wonder we will remain the way we are…follow follow politicians and supporters. APC busy welcoming the same people they called corrupt few months back….I WANT ALL OF YOU TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, IF GEJ DECIDES TO JOIN APC NOW OR 2015 ON THE CONDITION THAT THEY WILL GIVE HIM THE TICKET, APC WILL ACCEPT……TRUE OR FALSE Bosso \nAPC will not accept. Because of his inability to control corruption. People like Buhari will have nothing to do with a brazen corrupt individual like GEJ. If Tinubu wants gej that will break that alliance. Mr Igbo Sanity \nUntil the APC has run the federal Government for at least 8-14 years, beginning from 2015, NO ONE can judge the APC. period! Idongesit \nChief! Ignorance is a curable disease. Mr Igbo Sanity \nNot sure where you are going, if you can type “ignorance” you can google Nigeria constitution on defection of members of house and senate when their party is FACTIONALIZED! U.I.Y. \nIf I recall correctly, the high court did not declare that there was no division (crisis) in PDP. What the court said was that it could not recognise nPDP as the authentic party against PDP. It was the division that gave rise to going to court in the first instance. So there is division in PDP. All the Principal Officials of the party (including the president and the party chairman) at one time or another attested to this fact. \nINEC could not recognise nPDP because there is a procedure for electing party executives. Constitutionally, If there is crisis in a party, members elected under the platform can defect. There is crisis in PDP? Are the defectors guided by national interest? Mr Igbo Sanity \nNo to WORRY when the npdp FACTION visited the HOUSE AND THE SENATE it was entered on the HOUSE AND SENATE RECORDS THAT A “FACTION OF PDP” VISITED!. That’s all the defecting pdp members need to KEEP their SEATS! Mr Igbo Sanity \nDON’T UNDERESTIMATE the GENENRAL. General BUHARI! Generals are trained to WIN WARS not day to day BATTLES1 May God bless Gen. Buhari, Tinubu, (Okorocha, Onu, Akande, and all APC Chieftains who have been working diligently for nearly a year to wrestle power from the LARGEST CORRUPT AND FRAUDULENT PARTY ON THE PLANET, THE pdp! Segun Abayomi \nI think pdp is still in majority in the house Bosso \nFor now….yes. but watch what will happen from now on. The heavy barrell had been rolled down the slope nobody can stop its momentum. Mr Igbo Sanity \nAccording Senator Adedeye? APC now has commitments that totals 280 HOUSE members and about 75 Senators. That is more than two thirds of both houses, which is a VETO-PROOF MAJORITY, sufficient to THROW OUT the dumbo any time the APC FEELS LIKE IT! \nBut most IMPORTANTLY sufficient to pass any LAW WITHOUT Dumbo’s signature! kenmege \nThey just lost their seats. Their governors just led them to commit political suicide. nomso duke \nThats true,only time will tell as the will cry had i know at last. Bosso \nOnly an ignoramus talks like you. You dont know what you are talking about Mr Igbo Sanity \nNo to WORRY when the npdp FACTION visited the HOUSE AND THE SENATE it was entered on the HOUSE AND SENATE RECORDS THAT A “FACTION OF PDP” VISITED!. That’s all the defecting pdp members need to KEEP their SEATS! \nRead the Constitution on Defection of house and senate members when their party is FACTIONALIZED! pdp is DEAD. UP APC \nNIGERIANS ARE NOT INSANE! INSANITY is defined as voting pdp for 14 years and expecting a DIFFERENT RESULT! Mr Igbo Sanity \nPDP IS DEAD Emeka \nOne thing we can all agree is that there is an unprecedented level of corruption in Nigeria, and that the current president is either unwilling or ineffective at combating it. Now, I’ve got to tell you this: stealing of public funds is the biggest single thing that has stunted Nigeria’s development. Both PDP and APC are comprised of bands of thieves. Merely repainting your damaged-engine, stalled, 20 year-old car, will certainly not be enough to make the car run smoothly. The car will remain stalled until the engine is fixed, or replaced. The core members of both PDP and APC are people with damaged personalities who have made great fortunes by stealing public funds. Bosso \nIt will take just one honest person to clean up the whole.mess. you never know…that person may emerge from ApC. I dont hold much hope for such a person coming out of pdp. Too many egocentric and controlling thieves there esoecially at the top. nomso duke \nU got it right but i believe GEJ will suprise us when the time is right,he need a second chance to pull down and disgrace al this corrupt leaders. TOMMY \nNo, we did not have privileged upbringing but our mother emphasized education and that has been our salvation. Of my mother’s 6 children 4 have PhDs. Of the two without PhD, one has a Master’s and the other is an engineer. They are no slouches. Education provided a way to make our way in the world. \nYou are one of those petty people who think the progress and success of another takes from you. You try to overshadow everyone around you, before you and after you. You are the prototypical “Mr. Know it all”. You’ve never said “I don’t know” on any topic, ever. Of course this means you surround yourself with idiots who will agree with you on anything and need you for financial gain and you need them for your insatiable ego. This your attitude is a reflection of the country. It is not certain which came first, your attitude seeping into the country’s psyche or the country accepting your irresponsible behavior for so long. \nLike you and your minions, it’s a symbiotic relationship. Nigeria has descended into a hellish reality where smart, capable people to “survive” and have their daily bread prostrate to imbeciles. Everybody trying to pull everybody else down with greed and selfishness — the only traits that gets you anywhere. Money must be had and money and power is king. Even the supposed down-trodden agree with this. \nNigeria accused me of fraud with the Ministry of Health. As you yourself know, both in Abeokuta and Abuja I lived in your houses as a Senator. In Lagos, I stayed in my mum’s bungalow which she succeeded in getting from you when you abandoned her with six children to live in Abeokuta with Stella. \nI borrowed against my four-year Senate salary to build the only house I have anywhere in the world in Lagos. I rent out the house for income. I don’t have much in terms of money but I am extremely happy. I tried to contribute my part to the development of my country but the country decided it didn’t need me. Like many educated Nigerians my age, there are countries that actually value people doing their best to contribute to society and as many of them have scattered all over the world so have many of your children. \nI can speak for myself and many of them; what they are running away from is that they can’t even contribute effectively at the same time as they have to deal with constant threats to their lives by miscreants the society failed to educate; deal with lack of electricity and air pollution resulting from each household generating its own electricity, and the lack of quality healthcare or education and a total lack of sense of responsibility of almost every person you meet. Your contribution to this scenario cannot be overestimated. \nYou and your cronies mentioned in your letter have left the country worse than you met it at your births in the 1930’s and 1940’s. Nigeria is not the creation of any of you, and although you feel you own it and are “Mr Nigeria” deciding whether the country stays together or not, and who rules it; you don’t. Nigeria is solely the creation of the British. My dear gone Grandmother whose burial you told people not to attend, was not born a Nigerian but a proud Ijebu-Yoruba woman. Togetherness is a choice and it must serve a purpose. \nAs for Nigerians thinking I have their money, when it was obvious I was part of the Yar’Adua (government’s) anti-Obasanjo phenomenon that was going on at the time. The Ministry of Health and international NGOs paid for a retreat for the Senate Committee on Health. The House Committee on Health was treated exactly the same way. The monies were given to members as estacode and the rest used for accommodation, flights and feeding. While the Senate was on the retreat in Ghana, the EFCC asked the House Committee to return the monies they received for their retreat and asked us in the Senate to return ours on our return which I refused, as it was already used for the purpose it was earmarked for in the budget that year which was to work on the National Health Bill. \nThe House Committee had not gone on their retreat. I did nothing wrong and my colleagues and I on the retreat did our work conscientiously. I asked the EFCC not to drag my colleagues into it and I am proud I suffered alone. As is usual in a society where people who are not progressive but take pleasure in the pain of others, most Nigerians were happy, not looking at the facts of the matter, just the suffering of an Obasanjo. \nAs the people that stole their millions are hailed by them the innocent is punished. When the court case was thrown out because it lacked merit even against the Minister, no newspaper carried the news. The wrongful malicious prosecution of an Obasanjo was not something they wanted to report; just her downfall. But it really wasn’t about me, it was about right and wrong in society and every society gets the fruit of the seeds it sows. \nHow do you think God will provide good leaders to such a people? God helps those who help themselves. I have realized that as an Obasanjo I am not entitled to work in Nigeria in any capacity. I am not entitled to work in health which is my training, or in any field or anywhere in the country or participate in any business. I have learnt this lesson well and there are societies that actually think capable, well-educated people are important to their society’s progress. Apparently, unless I am eating from the dustbin, Nigerians and possibly you will not be satisfied. I thank God it has not come to that based on God-given brains and brawn. \nWhen I left Nigeria in 1989 for graduate studies in America, you promised to pay my school fees and no living expenses. This you did and I am grateful for because, working in the kitchen and then the library at University of California, Davis and later, working on the IT desk and later as a Teaching Assistant at Cornell gave me valuable work ethics for life. I wouldn’t have it any other way. As a black woman in the early 21st century, I have achieved much and done more than most. My wish is that black girls all over the world will have the capacity to create their lives, make mistakes, learn from it and move ahead. \nMoving back to Nigeria, thinking I wanted to serve was obviously a grave mistake but one brought about by the tragic incident of April 20, 2003. This was the day five people were shot dead in my car. The mother of the children was an acquaintance I had met only one day before the incident. \nWe had attended the same high school and university but she was there ten years earlier than I. She had also studied public health in the UK as I had in the US. It was these coincidences that made us connect on our first meeting and then she decided to visit on the Saturday of the election of 2003 when the incident occurred. I am scarred for life by that incident and I know the mother was too as we both looked back to see two men on each side of my car shooting. \nI understand her trauma and her behaviour since then can be judged from that. Nigeria is a nasty place that pushes people to lose their compass. I participated in the campaigns leading to the elections that day, more because this was my first experience of electoral process in Nigeria. Growing up there were no elections and I was too young in the 1979 and 1983 elections. It was interesting to see democracy at work. When Gbenga Daniel who I campaigned for offered me a job, I probably would have declined it, if not for the memory of the dead. \nI felt I had to engage in making the country progress and to avoid such incidences in the future. I don’t need to tell you or anyone what kind of governor and person Gbenga Daniel is. As usual when I found out, you would not listen to my opinion but found out for yourself. I also campaigned for Amosun for the Senate in 2003. I have had some wonderful Nigerians do good to me, I will never forget the then Minister of Women Affairs, who saw me talking in the crowd at a campaign event and was alarmed and said “bad things can happen to you out there, I will give you one of the orderlies assigned to my office to follow you”. This was the police man that died in my car that day. I never really thought bad things would happen to me, I moved around freely in society until that shooting scarred me and I accepted a police detail. I was constantly scared for my life after that. \nYou called me after your vengeful letter as usual, looking out for yourself and thinking you will bribe me by saying the APC will use me for the Senate. Do you really know me and what I want out of life? \nAnyone that knows me knows I am done with anything political or otherwise in Nigeria. I have so much to do and think to make this world a better place than to waste it on fighting with idiots over a political post that does no good to society. That letter you wrote to the President, would you have tolerated such a letter as a sitting President? Don’t do to others what you will not allow to be done to you. The only thing I was using that was yours was the house in Abuja where I left my things when I left the country. I eventually rented it out so that the place would not fall apart but as usual you want to take that as well. You can’t have it without explaining to Nigerians how you came about the house? \nAs I said earlier, this is not about politics but my frustration with you as a father and a human being. I am not involved with what is currently going on in Nigeria, I don’t talk to any Nigerian other than friends on social basis. I am not involved with any political groups or affiliation. You mentioned Governor Osoba when you spoke to me, yes I was walking down the street of Cambridge, Massachussets a few months ago, when I looked up and saw him reading a map trying to cross the street. \nI greeted him warmly and offered to give him a ride to where he was going. This I did not do because I wanted anything from him politically but because that is how I was raised by my mother to treat an adult who I really had no ill-will towards. Some said he was part of the people that manipulated the elections for me to lose in 2011. I don’t have any ill-will to him for that because I think they did me a favour and someone has to win and lose. \nI had told you I wasn’t going to run in 2011 but you manipulated me to run; that was my mistake. Losing was a blessing. As usual you wanted me to run for your self-serving purpose to perpetuate your name in the political realm and as the liar that you are, you later denied that it was you who wanted me to run in 2011. \nIn 2003 I ran because I wanted to and I thought getting to the central government I will be able to contribute more to improving lives and working on legislation that impacts the country. I found that nothing gets done; every public official in Nigeria is working for himself and no one really is serving the public or the country. \nThe whole system, including the public themselves want oppressors, not people working for their collective progress. When no one is planning the future of a country, such a country can have no future. I won’t be your legacy, let your legacy be Nigeria in the fractured state you created because, it was always your way or the highway. \nThis is the end of my communication with you for life. I pray Nigeria survives your continual intervention in its affairs. \nSincerely,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:20:11.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
