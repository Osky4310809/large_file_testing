ESPN said that according to Steelers receiver Cobi Hamilton, 15 Steelers have been affected. \n“We’re not making excuses,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said, according to ESPN. There won’t be. We’ll be there, we’ll be ready to play, this is just part of normal things that happen over the course of a season.” \nThe good news is that the four players who were out on Wednesday – kicker Chris Boswell, center B.J. Finney, receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey and quarterback Zach Mettenberger – all practiced Thursday. But it’s not ideal for multiple Steelers players to be weakened by the flu, especially at the end of a long and grueling season. \nThe Patriots will be tough to beat at home in an AFC championship game. If the Steelers are spending the week trying to get over the flu, it doesn’t make their challenge any easier. View photo .
