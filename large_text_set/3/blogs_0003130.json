Achieving that feat would mean a culmination of a program’s renaissance back to a bonafide big-school hoops power. \nGeorge Washington (24-2), the Denver Prep League champion, took one more step toward cementing that legacy on Saturday night at the Denver Coliseum, earning a wire-to-wire 65-52 victory over No. 11 Fort Collins to advance to the Final Four on Friday. \nDespite the loss, Fort Collins (22-4, Front Range League champions) enters the off-season with momentum following the program’s first Great 8 appearance since 1988. Senior Jacob Pfaffinger paced the Lambkins with 18 points, while senior Damien Murillo added 13 points. Related Articles March 2, 2017 Post Preps Podcast: Class 4A state tournament analysis ft.
