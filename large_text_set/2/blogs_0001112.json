Her bag was searched and N60,000 in different dominations was found. \n“Another N3,000 was found on her, but the accused confessed that she stole it at another wedding before coming to the complainant’s.” \nThe prosecutor told the court that the offence contravened Section 285 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011. \nThe accused may be jailed for three years if found guilty according to the provisions of the said section. \nThe accused, however, pleaded not guilty and was admitted to bail by the Magistrate O.
