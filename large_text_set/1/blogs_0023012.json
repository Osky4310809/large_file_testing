Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Reducing smoking and eating healthily during pregnancy are key factors in infant health \nFor example, in 2014 the UK had a higher infant mortality rate (of 3.9 per 1,000 live births) than nearly all comparable Western European countries. \nInfant mortality ranges from 3.6 in Scotland to 3.9 in England and Wales, and 4.8 in Northern Ireland. \nRates of smoking during pregnancy - an important factor in the health of babies - are higher in the UK than in many European countries, at 11.4% in England and nearly 15% in Scotland. \nSmoking during pregnancy was highest in deprived populations and in mothers under 20 years of age, the report found. Diabetes on the rise \nAccording to the report, there was also evidence that young people in the UK had low wellbeing compared with other comparable countries. \nAnd data shows that type-1 diabetes is an increasingly common condition among children and young people in the UK, making it the sixth top country in the world for new cases diagnosed each year. \nThe report lays out a number of key recommendations for improving the health and wellbeing of the nation's children. \nThese include: each government developing an evidence-based child health and wellbeing strategy ensuring universal early years' public health services, such as health visitors and school nurses, are prioritised and supported promoting good nutrition and exercise before, during and after pregnancy ensuring children who are overweight or obese can access services to help them lose weight introducing statutory and comprehensive personal, social and health education in all schools training all child health professionals so they can deal with children and young people with mental health problems \nThe State of Child Health report emphasised that poverty was at the root of many child health problems, leaving children from deprived backgrounds with far worse health and wellbeing than children growing up in affluent families. \nIn 2015-16, 40% of children in England's most deprived areas were overweight or obese, compared with 27% in the most affluent areas. \nOne in five children in the UK is living in poverty, the report says. 'Invest in child health' \nProf Russell Viner, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: \"The UK is more unequal than many other European countries, and children aren't a priority. \n\"We have some fantastic healthcare in certain institutions in this country, but it is very patchy. \n\"We want to see the NHS focus more on children's health, because they are our future workers and parents.

'Priority' \nAileen Campbell, Public Health Minister in Scotland, said: \"We agree that our children's health should be a priority for all.\" \nShe said the Scottish government had: made progress in reducing the damage done by tobacco increased the proportion of healthy-weight children improved the country's relationship with alcohol \nAnd it would now be focusing on delivering a child health and wellbeing strategy for Scotland. \nA Welsh government spokesman said it would be addressing health inequalities in Wales as part of a new healthy child programme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:28:26.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
