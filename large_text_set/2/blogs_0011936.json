Philip Hammond (Photo: PA) \nNow Labour MPs in former pit constituencies want a halt – and are demanding Mr Hammond gives future windfalls to former miners and their families instead. \nEx-shadow minister Gloria De Piero, who is leading the 22-MP group, accused the Treasury of pocketing an “obscene amount” of cash already and said: “Enough is enough.” \nThe row dates back to 1994, when British Coal was privatised and ministers agreed the Government would act as guarantor for its two pension schemes. \nUnder the deal, any future surplus would be split 50/50 between the Treasury and scheme members. Miners come off the last shift at Kellingley Colliery in Knottingley (Photo: PA) \nThe Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme had 200,000 members and the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme 57,000. \nWhile they were working miners contributed 5.25 per cent of their pay towards pensions. \nIn 1996 it was estimated the funds would generate a £2billion surplus over the next 25 years. \nBut they are doing much better than expected and the Treasury got a total of £10billion to spend on what it liked.

But in next month’s Budget I call on the Tories to put things right by promising future surpluses will go to ex-miners and their widows.” Gloria de Piero (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nMs De Piero has already met Business Secretary Greg Clark to find a solution but got no joy. \nNow she is setting up further talks with the MPS pension trustees to see if a new deal can be hammered out. \nFormer Notts NUM area president Keith Stanley added: “A lot of pensioners are on very, very low pensions whilst the Government has been making billions. \n“If we had run the MPS on our own maybe pensioners would not be on less than £10 a week pensions now. The spirit of the scheme when it was set up was to benefit miners, not governments.” Read More MP slams \"scandalous\"£3bn raid on miners' pension fund \nThe Government has received £3.4billion in its role as guarantor of the MPS and a further £3.1billion from the BCSSS. \nThe investment reserve funds are nearly £2.8billion while the contributions holiday dating back to 1987-94 takes the final sum to more than £10billion. \nThe money the Government has trousered would have been enough to pay for 16 new hospitals, 11,100 MRI scanners or hire 131,000 extra doctors. Coal mining has been going through a steady decline since the 1950s when there were 1,334 deep-mines and 92 surface mines. \nThe last deep mines in the UK, Hatfield and Kellingley, Yorks and Thoresby, Notts, closed in 2015. \nThe Business Department said: “The Government continues to guarantee pensions will be paid. Members have received pensions approximately 30 per cent larger than would have been the case without the guarantee and these will rise with inflation.” \nAccording to official estimates, 4,891 defined benefit schemes were in deficit last year and 1,054 in surplus. Whitehall splurge equals £40,000 for each pensioner Mine workers walk towards the pit head at Kellingley Colliery (Photo: Reuters) \nThe fortune spent by Whitehall is equal to £40,000 for each pensioner. \nAnd if each got a share in the £51million to be taken out for the next three years, it would amount to £600. \nEx-miner Trevor Sowter, 82, of Huthwaite, Notts said: “That would be very useful.” \nTrevor, above, who gets £200 a week, added: “We wanted our pensions protected but we never expected to be robbed later. \n“If we’d known then what we know now we’d never have agreed to the deal.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:02:24.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
