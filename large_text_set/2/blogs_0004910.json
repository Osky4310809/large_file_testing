I can’t really see what it is.” \nWithin seconds calls flood the Frederick County 911 center. \nCaller: “Oh, whoa, whoa! The truck is going to catch on fire any minute.” \nCaller: “I’m in my house in Frederick City and I hear the explosions, two. Boom boom boom boom.” \nFor miles drivers and people in the homes and even nearby schools could see the billowing smoke caused by the deadly accident. \n911 Dispatcher: “How many people are injuried?” \nCaller: “It looks like one car is fully engulfed and some truck hit the guardrail and two other dump trucks, ummm, rear ended each other and they’re all catching fire now.” \nWhile stopped for the motorcade, 46-year-old Jacob Jackson of Gaithersburg was hit from behind by a dump truck, forcing his Nissan Rogue to slam into the dump truck in front of him, crushing his vehicle, and killing Jackson. \nCaller: “I just heard two huge additional explosions.” \nCaller: “They definitely going to need paramedics here.” \nThe question still remains: was the road closure necessary for the motorcade? The motorcade was transporting U.S. Democratic senators from D.C. through Maryland to a luxury retreat in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. \nMaryland State Police are currently conducting this ongoing investigation. U.S. Capitol police have not commented on its decision to close traffic. \nThere was one fatality, and others were injured but they refused medical treatment. \nNames of the senators on the bus still have not been released. The Frederick County Sate’s Attorney’s office are waiting until the full investigation is complete when it comes to any potential charges in this accident. \n  Marcus Washington Marcus Washington   June 2014 as the weekend evening anchor and reporter.
