According to a number of analysts , Apple has scrapped plans to add a curved display to its next flagship phone. Among those analysts is KGI Securities’ Ming Chi-Kuo , who has a strong track record of predicting Apple products.\nThe curved display is one of the hottest rumors circulating about the iPhone 8.\nThe news is a bit disappointing even though it was always a pie in the sky type of rumor. The iPhone 8 is still rumored to include a 5.8-inch OLED flat display with reduced front bezels that will eliminate the home button. If Apple would have included a curved display, it would have been one of the most surprising additions. The new iPhone is still expected to be a big departure from the iPhone 7’s design, which has been the same since the iPhone 6 debuted in 2014. That’s a long time time for an upgrade.\nThe i Phone 8 still feels like the more exciting phone compared to the Galaxy S8, even without the curved display. We’ll keep you posted on any new rumors or leaks pertaining to the iPhone 8.\nCheck out the video above to see Jon’s thoughts on the rumor.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:31:45.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
