Eleven of those cases in the Denver metro area are part of a linked outbreak that health officials are still sorting out, said Rachel Herlihy, the director of the Disease Control and Environmental Epidemiology Division at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. \n“We are actively investigating that outbreak and do expect those numbers to climb,” Herlihy said. \nColorado saw only 17 cases of mumps in all of 2016. Nationally, there were more than 5,300 cases in 2016, a massive increase over the previous five years when annual cases hovered around 1,000.

But vaccination drastically reduced the number of annual cases. People who are vaccinated can still catch mumps if exposed, but it is much less likely.\nHerlihy said the latest outbreak in Colorado is among a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated people. \nMumps spreads through direct contact with an infected person. It causes painful swelling in the glands of the cheek and jaw. More serious problems are possible but rare.
