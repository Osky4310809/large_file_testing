This year the company just slyly dropped the date when the S8 will be revealed.\nThe announcement is just a black back drop with the front and botton white bezels of the expected phone that has the tag line “unbox your phone” in the center. It lines up with all the leaks we’ve seen, confirming that the front home button will be axed. There have been tons of leaks of the phone over the past few weeks, including the full spec list , but now we have a concrete date.\nWhat we know so far The S8 should go on sale some time in April. It will feature a Snapdragon 835 processor, 5.8-inch QHD+ OLED display, 4GB of RAM and a 12MP Dual Pixel camera. Samsung is also expected to announced a S8 Plus variant , but that just speculation at this point.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:47:49.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
