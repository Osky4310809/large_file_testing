The Dorbz received the biggest addition, as along with the regular Spidey a chase Peter Parker unmasked Spidey will also be available, as will a homemade Spider-Man suit version. The homemade Spider-Man suit has also been added to the keychain line. \nThe biggest new addition though will undoubtedly be the casual Tony Stark POP, which has Stark in a suit jacket and Funko Kitty t-shirt. He's rocking his orange tinted specs and of course has his signature goatee. \nHit the next slide to see the new additions up close. The Pint Size Heroes and Plushies line will start hitting stores in May, while the rest of the lin will be hitting retailers in April. \nA young Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who made his sensational debut in Captain America: Civil War, begins to navigate his newfound identity as the web-slinging super hero in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter returns home, where he lives with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.). Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine – distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man – but when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as a new villain, everything that Peter holds most important will be threatened. \nThe cast includes Tom Holland, Michael Keaton, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Tyne Daly, Bokeem Woodbine, with Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. It also includes Jon Favreau, Martin Starr, Kenneth Choi, Michael Mando, Selenis Leyva, Isabella Amara, Jorge Lendeborg, Jr., JJ Totah, Hannibal Buress, and Jacob Batalon. \nSpider-Man: Homecoming will be released on July 7, 2017.
