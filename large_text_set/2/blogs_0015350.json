(Reuters) \nManeka Gandhi, Union Minister for Women and Child Development, is known for not mincing her words on issues that are related to the well being of women. Speaking to Manorama News TV channel at 4 PM today, she stated that there has been a complete breakdown of law and order in Kerala and that there is an urgent need to impose President’s rule in the state. \nManeka Gandhi told reporters, “What is happening in Kerala is not good. We see that women, children and vulnerable sections of the society are targeted by goons. We see that mafia and criminal gangs rule the state. There is no law and order in place. It is time to impose President’s rule in the state.” \nShe further stated, “Kerala has degenerated into a state which is not safe for anyone. There has been a complete breakdown of law and order in the state. Criminals and gangs receive political support. No action is taken against them by the police. No one is listening to the Chief Minister, not even bureaucrats are listening to the Chief Minister. It is time for the Chief Minister to take stock of the situation. Kerala police chief who is trying to take some action is being mocked. This is what is happening in Kerala.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:55:37.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
