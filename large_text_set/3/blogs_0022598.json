Around 90% want free trade, the highest favourability and the narrowest difference on any question between the two groups. It is the single most popular issue, trumping even border controls for Leave voters. With so many Leavers supporting free trade, which Brexit imperils, it seems that when they voted in the referendum they either didn’t understand the implications of their choice, or have now changed their minds. The differences of opinion are starker when “hard” Brexit questions are asked. The gap between Leave and Remain voters was up to a third on the main hard-Brexit issue of immigration controls. Some 86% of Leave voters support strong measures compared with 54% of Remainers. Compared with NatCen’s earlier report in November, this latest survey shows a certain amount of stability in public opinion. It gives a good indication of what British voters want from Brexit, but unfortunately their demands are often unrealistic. Leave voters, especially, want to retain the benefits of membership, but do away with things they dislike. Managing their expectations during the coming negotiation will not be easy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:28:23.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
