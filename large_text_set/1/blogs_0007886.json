Yet I will take away plenty of positives from the match.\" \nGriezmann's second-half goal took his tally to three in as many matches and Simeone said: \"When [Griezmann] scores it looks like he's playing better, but there are some matches where he doesn't score despite also playing better. \n\"Obviously, though, it's better for us if he scores. He opened up the match.\" \nCorrea, who scored after Marko Livaja equalised for Las Palmas on the night, added: \"I'm happy because it's always nice to score and help the team but now we need to continue working for what's coming.\" \nSimeone continued: \"I thought it was a complete performance from the whole team. \n\"[Correa] kept up his improvement, as he always creates chances and is always working towards a goal. He'll be important going forward.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T03:24:26.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
