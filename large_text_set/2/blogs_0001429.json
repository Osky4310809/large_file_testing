It appears that the term ‘privilege’ does not apply to them. Nor do they care to learn what it is.” \nFisher said his white profs “think that by not saying racist comments in class, they are doing good.” But, he said, that “halfhearted attempt further contributes to the oppression that I experience in my predominantly white classrooms.” \nFisher said one prof — a “white man from the suburbs” who “showed images of slaves on plantations” — didn’t acknowledge his “privilege,” which “led to some of the trauma that I experienced in class.” \nIn addition, Fisher said the professor allowed “students to say ignorant comments in class,” and because he “wanted to protect the voices of the white students who benefit from black oppression, the oppression unfortunately continued. It even led to me mentally breaking down in the classroom.” \nDoes it get any more childish than this? \nGrow up, baby. \nDonald Trump is president because the majority of the nation is tired of hearing from whiny little girls like James Fisher. \nDid that hurt your feelings, James? \nGuess what? \nI really don’t care – and neither does anyone else! \nEnough is enough.
