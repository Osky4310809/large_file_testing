As the grey Hyundai 4×4 swerved on to the pavement yesterday afternoon, witnesses said a woman threw herself off Westminster Bridge, plummeting nearly 20 feet into the waters of the Thames.\nThe London Port Authority later confirmed that it had pulled a woman from the river who was still alive but with serious injuries.\nOn the bridge itself carnage ensued as the car repeatedly swerved on to the pavement, leaving more than 40 pedestrians injured and at least two dead in the space of 10 seconds. Another pedestrian was later declared dead.\nIt was the terrorist attack that police and security services always feared, but hoped would never come. A man, dressed all in black, drove a car at 50 mph the full length of Westminster Bridge, aiming deliberately at pedestrians and cyclists.\nThe bodies were scattered in his wake. One woman died after she was hit and thrown under the wheels of a bus; another woman was struck as she walked past a stand selling postcards to tourists. She lay on the ground under the shadow of Big Ben, blood pouring from the wound in her head and seeping into cracks in the pavement.\nJames West via AP People stand near a crashed car and an injured person lying on the ground, right, on Bridge Street near the Houses of Parliament in London, Wednesday, March 22, 2017. The driver of the Hyundai 4×4 then crashed the vehicle into the iron railings that surround the Palace of Westminster, hitting at least two more pedestrians. He leapt from the car and ran around the corner, brandishing a kitchen knife, eight inches long.\nHundreds of tourists and workers, panicked into a “stampede”, ran for their lives while, the attacker ran for Parliament Square. Just within the entrance he slashed and stabbed at an unarmed policeman, who would later die of his wounds.\nIt was only then that the marauder was stopped in his tracks as a plain clothes officer fired two, possibly three, shots into the intruder’s chest.\n“Oh God, it was horrible,” said Robert who was on the top deck of a bus. “All of a sudden I saw two Chelsea boots hit the window on the top deck. I thought someone had chucked their shoes at the window.\n“I jumped up… I heard a scream. Then I looked at the pavement down below and I saw a girl’s legs sticking out of the back of my bus, under the wheel, a woman on the bridge reeling in pain.”\nAP Photo A girl lying on the ground is treated by passers-by on the Embankment near to the Houses of Parliament in London, Wednesday March 22, 2017. Related Five dead and 40 injured in ‘sick and depraved terrorist attack’ outside U.K. Parliament Radek Sikorski, Poland’s former foreign minister and now a senior fellow at the Harvard Centre for European Studies, posted a video on Twitter showing people lying injured. The horrifying images were some of the first posted on the Internet.\n“I heard what I thought was just a collision and then I looked through the window of the taxi and [saw] someone down, obviously in great distress,” said Mr Sikorski. “Then I saw a second person down, and I started filming, then I saw three more people down, one of them bleeding profusely.”\nA car on Westminster Bridge has just mowed down at least 5 people. pic.twitter.com/tdCR9I0NgJ \n— Radosław Sikorski (@sikorskiradek) March 22, 2017 \n\nMichael Adamou, 25, was driving the 453 bus when he said he saw a grey Hyundai 4×4 speeding in the direction of Parliament. He said: “As I turned left out of Whitehall, so turning left to go over the bridge, I saw a car knock two people over.\n“Initially I thought he’s lost control of the car, but then I see quite a few people rushing into Parliament and police trying to stop everyone. After a few seconds I just heard gunshots. Everybody on my bus was panicking.”\nHe stepped off the bus to a scene of devastation. “The first thing I saw was the two people lying lifeless on the floor. They were on the pavement.\n“He must have come down the whole side of the bridge on the pavement. I would say there were at least 15 or 20 people [lying on the pavement].”\nIsmail Hassan, 45, who was riding across Westminster Bridge on his motorbike, watched as the car gradually picked up speed.\n“At first I thought the car had lost balance, but he was going in and coming back in a zig-zag, he did it about three times. The car was hitting people on the pavement. The third time there was a guy who collapsed in the middle of the road. He wasn’t moving at all. At first we didn’t know what was happening, it took less than 10 seconds.”\nStefan Rousseau/PA via AP A body is covered by a sheet outside the Houses of Parliament, London, Wednesday, March 22, 2017. Rob Lyon, a 34-year-old who works in marketing, managed to jump into the road to avoid the car after he heard the “crunch of metal against the curb”.\nHe said: “We had just passed a group of Chinese tourists taking photographs of Big Ben. Suddenly I heard a crunch of metal against the curb. It was the wheel of the car.\n“A colleague said, ’Rob, get out of the way’. I saw people being hit. I jumped from the pavement into the road. I saw people passing me that had been hit. Someone that was hit, certainly a gentleman, was airborne. One lady tragically had gone under the bus, that was on the road. She didn’t look like she had much of a chance.\n“It was almost like the world had slowed down. It was like being in a Hollywood movie instead of real life. I didn’t for a second think that someone was intentionally driving a car at me.”\n“When I was getting everybody off the bus, because they made us leave the bus on the bridge, I heard one guy come running behind me shouting that his wife had jumped into the river to avoid getting knocked down.”\nThe car also hit a group of French pupils on a school trip, with two of them said to be in a critical condition.\n(ITN via AP Emergency personnel gather around a body on the southside of Westminster Bridge that leads to the Houses of Parliament in London, Wednesday, March 23, 2017. According to Le Telegramme, a newspaper in Brittany, the three pupils from the Lycee Saint-Joseph de Concarneau were walking when the car hit them. “One of them ended up on the bonnet of the vehicle”, said one of the classmates who witnessed the scene, it was reported. “We saw the car hit a group. Twenty seconds later, it was us,” said Kilian, one of the pupils, in a text message to his mother, the newspaper reported.\nOne of the teachers said: “Three of us were hit, we don’t know if they are dead or not. I cannot speak anymore, I don’t know what to say.”\nOne of the group of 10 – a young teenage girl – sat and wept openly on a bench a few hundred yards from the scene of devastation and destruction.\nShe was wrapped in a foil blanket and being comforted by fellow pupils.\nSteve Voake, 55, was walking across the bridge towards the South Bank when he saw the aftermath. He said he saw at least two bodies lying on the road and one in the water.\n“I saw a trainer lying in the road and when I looked more closely I saw that there were a couple of bodies the other side of the road,” he said. “And when I looked over the side there was another body lying in the water with blood all around it.”\nAlso among those injured were three police officers who were on their way back from a commendation ceremony.\nThere were distressing scenes on the southern end of Westminster Bridge where a severely injured woman was seen being tended to by passers-by.\n\nIt appears that the injured woman, who had long blonde hair and was wearing black jeans and trainers, later succumbed to her injuries and was covered with a sheet by police.\nAn American student who witnessed the scene said: “It was horrible. She’d been carried down from the bridge to be looked after, but I think she just have died because she was then moved out of sight.”\nEyewitnesses described how the attacker leapt from his car after his deadly drive. But his attack was far from over.\nRick Longley, 50, a health and safety manager from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, recalled: “He got out the car. I was standing next to the policeman right at the entrance where Big Ben is right behind you.\n“There was a car crash and all the crowd surged around the corner. I couldn’t work out why they were surging. But as the crowd surged, this guy with a beard came over my shoulder, brushed me and then he got a huge knife and was plunging it into the policeman. He was literally with a huge knife plunging it into this guy.\n“I’ve never seen anything like it. The policeman was cowering. He didn’t know what to do.”\n– With files from Robert Mendick, The Daily Telegraph \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:03:26.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
