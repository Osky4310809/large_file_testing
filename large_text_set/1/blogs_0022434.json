They should express their strong opinion in opposition to Senators voting to confirm his nominees and that we’re not going away.”\nShe says it’s a moment for the other side to listen closely.\n“They didn’t just have to endure one day of marching. They are going to have to pay attention to us,” said Wasserman Schultz.\nIt’s also a moment for those marchers and supporters, she says.\n“We are going to mobilize and organize and you’ll see many of those women run for office, support candidates, make contributions,” said Wasserman Schultz. “This is a sleeping giant that has been awakened.”\nWatch the full interview on Sunday’s Facing South Florida with Jim DeFede starting at 8:30 a.m. on CBS4.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:43:37.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
