You know, the goddamn X-Men!\nID: 10656019 2. You never get to see Wolverine and Nightcrawler be best friends. View this image ›\nJohn Byrne / Marvel Comics ID: 10656040 3. You never see a “fastball special,” i.e., Colossus throwing Wolverine at a bad guy. View this image ›\nAlan Davis / Marvel Comics ID: 10656069 4. You never see the tortured romance of Colossus and Kitty Pryde. View this image ›\nJohn Cassaday / Marvel Comics Ah, the wonderful metaphor of the man who can cover himself in armor and the girl who can become a ghost.\nID: 10656091 5. You also never meet the teleporting mutant sorceress Illyana Rasputin, who is the younger sister of Colossus. View this image ›\nOlivier Coipel / Marvel Comics Illyana is also the best friend of Kitty Pryde, and someone who has been to hell and back – quite literally.\nID: 10656727 6. You never see Kitty Pryde’s pet dragon Lockheed. View this image ›\nMike Weiringo / Marvel Comics Just want to put it out there that Kitty Pryde had a pet dragon long before Daenerys Targaryen was a thing.\nID: 10657326 7. You never see anything resembling the ’90s lineup either, which everyone knows from the classic animated series and the Jim Lee era of comics. View this image ›\nJim Lee / Marvel Not everyone is in this picture, but that would include Charles Xavier, Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Jean Grey, Beast, Rogue, Gambit, Colossus, Archangel, Psylocke, Iceman, Bishop, and Jubilee.\nID: 10656116 8. You never see the tortured romance of Rogue and Gambit. View this image ›\nAndy Kubert / Marvel The skeevy bad boy falls for the woman who cannot be touched!\nID: 10656136 9. You never see the tortured romance of Archangel and Psylocke. View this image ›\nSteve Epting / Marvel Comics Though, in fairness, they have set up the possibility for this in X-Men: Apocalypse .\nID: 10656762 10. You also never see Rogue’s tortured romance with Magneto. View this image ›\nJim Lee / Marvel Comics U , just try not to think about the age difference there.\nID: 10656575 11. The X-Men never go to space, and never encounter the Shi’Ar Empire. Frank Quitely / Marvel, Dave Cockrum / Marvel Comics The Shi’Ar are a crucial element of X-Men mythology, and are featured in several classic stories including The Dark Phoenix Saga . Princess Lilandra is also Charles Xavier’s primary love interest.\nID: 10656830 12. They also never encounter the creepy, bodysnatching alien race known as the Brood. View this image ›\nPaul Smith / Marvel Comics ID: 10656867 13. You never see the Morlocks, the society of mutant outcasts who live in the sewers below Manhattan rather than in a mansion like the X-Men. View this image ›\nPaul Smith / Marvel Comics An important contrast with the relative privilege the X-Men enjoy, as well as a rejection of Charles Xavier’s belief that mutants should assimilate into human society.\nID: 10656193 14. And you never see Storm become leader of the Morlocks after defeating Callisto in hand-to-hand combat. View this image ›\nPaul Smith / Marvel Comics The rivalry of Callisto and Storm in the ’80s goes beyond a simple “hero vs. villain” dynamic, and pushes Storm to learn lessons from Callisto that help her become a better and more proactive leader for mutants.\nID: 10656228 15. You never see Storm’s infatuation with the Japanese thief Yukio, or how that inspires her to ditch the goddess look in favor of a street punk aesthetic. Paul Smith / Marvel Comics Storm appears in five X-Men movies and you never get even a hint of her fluid sexuality.\nID: 10656394 16. You never see Storm lose her powers, or her tortured romance with Forge, the man who created the machine that robbed her of her connection to the elements. View this image ›\nBarry Windsor-Smith / Marvel Comics Forge, the man who can invent anything he imagines, but has very little imagination. What a perfect metaphor for the type of boyfriend who has all the potential in the world, but no initiative to realize any of it.\nID: 10656380 17. You never see Mystique’s not-so-tortured romance with Destiny. View this image ›\nPaul Smith / Marvel Comics Mystique and Destiny were portrayed as a long-term lesbian couple through most of the ’80s, even if writer Chris Claremont wasn’t allowed to explicitly state that on page at the time. Of course, this relationship ends in tragedy, and Mystique never fully recovers from the loss.\nID: 10656689 18. You never see Genosha, the island nation whose economy thrives as a result of the government brainwashing and enslaving mutants. View this image ›\nRick Leonardi / Marvel Comics The X-Men liberate Genosha, which is an important step in the group’s evolution away from supporting the status quo and towards becoming true revolutionaries.\nID: 10656343 19. You never see the rivalry of Bishop and Gambit. View this image ›\nJim Lee / Marvel Comics Well, you see, Bishop is a mutant policeman from the future and…\nID: 10657312 20. You never see Jason “Mastermind” Wyngarde, the creepy illusion-casting mutant who torments Jean Grey. View this image ›\nStuart Immonen / Marvel Comics Hint: That’s not his real face.\nID: 10657376 21. You never see Mister Sinister, the Machiavellian and ultra-glam geneticist obsessed with Cyclops and Jean Grey’s genes. View this image ›\nEsad Ribic / Marvel Comics Oh, and he’s also a Victorian dandy!\nID: 10656288 22. You never see Cassandra Nova, Charles Xavier’s genocidal non-corporeal twin sister. View this image ›\nFrank Quitely / Marvel Comics She is pure evil and utterly terrifying.\nID: 10656912 23. You never see the malicious telepath Amahl Farouk, a.k.a. the Shadow King. View this image ›\nJohn Byrne / Marvel Comics Magneto may be Xavier’s greatest rival, but Farouk is his ultimate nemesis.\nID: 10657564 24. You never see the tortured romance of Cyclops and Emma Frost after Jean Grey dies. View this image ›\nChris Bachalo / Marvel Comics Scott and Emma’s relationship is arguably the most complex of all X-romances, and pushes Emma further into the role of being hero after years of serving as the White Queen of the Hellfire Club while complicating Scott’s morality and nudging him towards becoming a political radical.\nID: 10656543 25. You never see the X-Men play baseball. View this image ›\nAlan Davis / Marvel Comics This is not a joke; the X-Men play baseball all the time.\nID: 10657149 26. You never see Iceman come out as gay . View this image ›\nMarvel Comics Granted, this is a more recent development.\nID: 10657192 27. You never see Wolverine as Kitty Pryde’s mentor. View this image ›\nAlan Davis / Marvel Comics ID: 10656648 28. Or as Jubilee’s mentor. View this image ›\nJim Lee / Marvel Comics ID: 10656637 29. Or as Armor’s mentor. Wolverine just loves to mentor teen girls, OK? It’s not weird.
