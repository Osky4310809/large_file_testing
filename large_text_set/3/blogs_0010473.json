Close A Trip through the Ghost Towns That Tell Montana's Storied Past UP NEXT VIDEO A Trip through the Ghost Towns That Tell Montana's Storied Past \nTemer surprised Brazilian politics watchers this week with the revelation that he has decamped from the Alvorada Palace and moved with his former beauty queen wife and their seven-year-old son down the road to the smaller vice presidential residence. \nThe modernist Alvorada, which means Dawn and was designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, would be a dream home for many. It has a huge pool, football field, chapel, medical center and vast lawn. \nBut Temer, 76, and his 33-year-old wife Marcela, find the cavernous, glass-fronted building spooky. \n\"I felt something strange there. I wasn't able to sleep right from the first night. The energy wasn't good,\" Temer was quoted as saying by Veja. \n\"Marcela felt the same thing. Only (their son) Michelzinho, who went running from one end to the other, liked it.\" \n\"We even started to wonder: could there be ghosts?\" he reportedly quipped to Veja. \nAccording to a report in Globo newspaper, Marcela Temer brought in a priest to attempt to drive out any evil spirits, but to no avail. \nThe Temers then moved to the still luxurious but smaller Jaburu Palace nearby. \nTemer knows it well: this was his residence when he served as vice president until last year when then president Dilma Rousseff was impeached for breaking budget accounting laws. \nThat automatically put Temer in the top job and in the Alvorada. No one filled his vacant vice presidential post, however, meaning he can now take his pick of palaces. \nThe house moving comes in the middle of a severe political crisis for Brazil, with many of Temer's allies facing potential corruption probes. \nThe president himself is battling a case in the electoral court where he is accused of having benefited from illegal donations when he and Rousseff ran together in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T00:44:27.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
