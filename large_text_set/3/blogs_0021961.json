Yesterday at your drive thru we had a less than cheerful encounter . At no fault of yours, you were out of carriers and said you could not take my empty cup (trash). I was less than understanding and my manner was curt.\nI need to apologize. The thought of leaving a trail of unkindness like that is not the path I want to reflect. Not for you, not for me.\nYou are a young man, clearly working hard to build a future and you should be commended. Keep up your attitude of cheer and hope. Stay hopeful no matter what kind of people cross your path (or drive thru )\nSurely, God has good blessings in store.\nYou taught this ole lady something yesterday about kindness, compassion and staying humble.\nI thank you! Debbie \nA woman came through the drive through yesterday and got a little irritated with me because we didn’t have drink carriers. Today, she came back and handed me this. from pics \n\nThe heartfelt apology came with a $50 bill, and is a sweet reminder to not leave a “trail of unkindness” as we go about our days. Everyone we meet – from the people we work with to the people brewing and serving our coffee – is just trying, like us, to get through the day. We could all use a little push to be kinder to the people we meet and spread a little more positivity through the world.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:02:46.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
