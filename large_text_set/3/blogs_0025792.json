The brewpub with food from ex-Leopold chef Jeffrey Hedin will soft open tonight. It’ll only be open Thursday through Sunday to start before expanding hours and days later this year. It’s been almost two years since Alulu was first announced, as ownership originally wanted to open in late 2015. Besides the craft beers—brewed in house—it’ll also pour a batch of craft sodas which can also be spiked. Alulu is also promising a series of creative cocktails. Chicago firefighter Frank Costanzo is the head brewer. Costanzo is an award-winning home brewer and he’s garnered acclaim for a Russian imperial stout made with Ipsento coffee. Perhaps Alulu can become a real-life Molly’s Bar, the watering hole firefighters frequent on TV’s Chicago Fire. On TV, the bar is portrayed by Lottie’s Pub in Bucktown. \nThis Friday and beyond, come enjoy some #craftbeer, great food and unique cocktails at our #brewpub in #pilsen. Posted by ALULU on Sunday, March 19, 2017 Although it’s opening to the public this week, Alulu’s ownership is releasing details about their brewpub slower than Sean Spicer. There’s no information available about Hedin’s food menu—not even on its website. Over at Leopold, which closed in 2013 in Noble Square, Hedin focused on Belgian food, which would pair well with beer. The only information available right now is via a Facebook post touting the tastiness of the pierogis from a friends and family service. Ownership claims they’ll lift the embargo later this spring. Given that the first day of spring was on Monday, any details would come weeks after opening. Alulu will join Moody Tongue Brewing Co. as places in Pilsen to grab a brewery-fresh beer. It’ll eventually be joined by Low Rez Brewing, which recently completed construction on its own Pilsen taproom. It’s been a long wait for the team at Alulu, so if curious drinkers want to finally taste what Costanzo has been brewing, Alulu opens tonight in Pilsen. Alulu , 2011 S.
