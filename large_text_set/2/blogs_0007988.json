Today it announced it was adding Einstein AI to its Service Cloud customer service platform. \nThe goal is to make life easier for customer service reps and their managers. For the reps, it gives information that is supposed to help them better understand the needs of the customer they’re dealing with. For the managers, it’s been designed to help give deeper insight into their customer service center operation. The ultimate goal is improving the key customer satisfaction metric known as CSAT. \nFor the customer service rep, it starts with how the call gets routed to them. It uses underlying intelligence to route the call to the best available rep based on known information, and it provides the rep with some background before they even interact with the customer. \nAll that should help the CSR do their jobs better and be more efficient with the customer. They also get fed some data on the right side of the customer service window, which the system thinks will help improve the CSAT score. Einstein case management window.

You also have to absorb several data points, which Einstein has determined could be having an impact on the projected score. That’s all well and good, but viewing this data requires taking your attention away from the customer.

All of this is useful in compiling and improving that all important CSAT score. \nSalesforce has been developing its artificial intelligence technology for some time. As I wrote at the time of the announcement in September: \nThe company pulled together 175 data scientists to help create Salesforce Einstein, while leveraging acquisitions such as MetaMind, PredictionIO and RelateIQ. In fact, MetaMind founder Richard Socher, holds the title of Chief Data Scientist at Salesforce now. Salesforce Einstein will touch every one of its products in some way eventually. \nIndeed today’s announcement is a continuation of that original vision, and we can expect that over the coming months and years, additional Salesforce products will get the Einstein treatment.
