Advice here is for informational purposes only and should not be considered final or official advice. See a local attorney for the best answer to your questions. \nSee our list of megathreads before posting your question. \nSee our best posts at /r/bestoflegaladvice ! \n/r/legaladviceofftopic is for chat and discussion about the posts, and discussions on update posts. \nGet answers to our most common questions, pointers to other sites about the law, and information about finding a lawyer of your own at the /r/legaladvice wiki . \nBasic guidelines: \nPlease only use responses as guidelines to better prepare yourself for when you meet with a lawyer. \nLawyers everywhere usually offer low-or-no cost consultations. \nPosting personally identifiable information will get you banned. \nPlease do not delete your post after you've received help. If you're worried about your identity, create a throwaway. We want to help as many people as possible, and that includes those who may stumble upon your post later. \nIf you've posted about the same or a related issue before in this subreddit, please provide a link to your previous post \nAfter you submit your post, please click the \"flair\" button below it and choose the best option. \nUsers with stars have been recognized for consistently strong contributions. Read about them and the guidelines for requesting one here. \nIt's ok to joke around a bit, but it's not ok to ONLY joke around here. Please offer legal information if you have it, and if you don't, keep your comments to yourself. \nPosts containing primarily negative comments, and lacking in advice, will be summarily removed without warning. Users who are consistent problems will be banned. Post to help, not to flame. \nPosts should not advertise, offer or promote any service, legal or otherwise. \nPosts or comments encouraging others to contact the media or to post on social media will be removed. \nPosts should contain a summary of the issue and a direct legal question. Posts containing videos and asking us to analyze will be summarily removed. \nIf you're linking to a reddit post, use NP links ( http://np.reddit.com/... ) \nPlease do not request to be contacted or offer to contact over PM. \nPlease do not post links to videos, including YouTube, in either posts or comments. \nPlease do not offer or request a recommendation for a specific attorney or law firm. \nThe mods have discretion to remove any post or comment they believe to be disruptive, unhelpful, or otherwise detrimental. \nPosting Notes : \nAlways include your location in the title or body of your post. If in the US, include your state; if in Canada, include your province; else, give your country. Laws change dramatically as you cross borders. \nIf your post is an update to a previous post, please use [Update] in the subject line, and include a link to your previous post. Discussion on update posts may take place in our sister subs, /r/legaladviceofftopic or /r/bestoflegaladvice . If you want your update post unlocked because you have further questions, please message the mods. \nHypothetical posts, political posts, law discussions should be posted on /r/legaladviceofftopic . Questions and comments that are substantially political in nature are outside the scope of the sub, and are subject to removal without warning. \nPlease consider posting to /r/LegalAdviceUK with questions from the UK or /r/AusLegal for questions from Australia. You will have a greater chance at someone being familiar with the laws of your area. \nThe spam filter occasionally eats good posts.
