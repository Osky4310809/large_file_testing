The fastfood giant knows a thing or two about making a viral online video. Screenshots from Jollibee/Facebook \nMANILA, Philippines – Days before Valentine's day, Philippine social media was lit up by a string of \"hugot\" advertisements from fastfood giant Jollibee. Since being unleashed on what would've otherwise been an unremarkable Thursday evening in February, the first video (\"Vow\") has since received 13 million views at the time of writing. \nThe succeeding shorties, most likely, elicited booming fistpumps from the ad makers just as well, with \"Crush\" and \"Date\" making it rain with 11 million and 9 million views respectively. \nThe \"Vow\" and \"Crush\" videos topped the previous high for the 'bee: the JolliDance Showdown and its 10 million views. The laggard among the 3, \"Date,\" vaulted over the previous top 2 video, \"Kahera,\" the brand's offering for grandparents' day in September. The clip currently has 7 million views. \nAll the videos mentioned up to this point are some of the brand's biggest hits on Facebook. With numbers like that, it's clear that Jollibee knows a thing or two about effective digital advertising. \nAnd it's not just dumb luck. Founder of e-commerce startup Ava Online Group, Oliver Segovia points out in a blog post that there's a method to the success of the recent online videos: \" Jollibee has been experimenting with videos for a long time. Winning with content takes time and investment to discover what works. This is not a traditional three-month campaign. It takes patience and commitment from brands to stumble upon the winning formula.\" \nCutting out Jollibee's pre-Valentine trio, we've compiled the brand's 10 most viewed Facebook videos. All of them broke the 5-million mark, enough views for the videos to qualify as viral. \n1) \"JolliDance Showdown\" - 297,243 Likes · 10,056,643 viewsReleased: February 27, 2016 \nIto na nga ang moment na pinakahihintay ni Jollibee!

Silipin itong masayang handog mula sa Jollibee! Posted by Jollibee on Saturday, December 10, 2016 \nInterestingly, all the videos are from 2016. For Jollibee, this means that they may have indeed figured out a formula that puts their videos in a position to succeed. Jollibee's 1st video came out in 2011, an ad for a tie-up with Captain America: The First Avenger. It had 81 likes and 12 shares. \nThe rise in views can also be attributed to Facebook's healthy user growth. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the total number of users rose to 1.86 billion, a 17% increase from the past quarter. (Read: Facebook earns $3.7-B in last quarter of 2016 ) \nUS figures reported by Fortune also show that online ad spending is simply growing fast to the tune of $17.6 billion spent in the third quarter of 2016 . That's 20% higher compared to the same period last year, largely attributed to the growth of mobile and video. Facebook, along with Google, accounted for 99% of that growth, effectively making them a duopoly. \nThese growth trends, along with Jollibee's longstanding foray into online videos, have helped buoy the success of their pre-Valentine's ads. \nBeyond Jollibee, the videos also represent a victory for digital media against traditional media such as TV: Online campaigns work and they can get the views at a breakneck pace. \nThe aforementioned Segovia speaks up about this point as well, saying that Jollibee has uncovered \"strategic leverage\" to bring down the cost that traditional media demands. He cited Globe as an example, too, which grew its business even as it shifted its outdoor and print spending to digital. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
