The club believes the new stadium is vital if it is to achieve a sustainable future. \nHowever, there has been some protest. Opponents are to deliver information packs to local residents. \nIn July last year, the Say No To Kingsford Stadium group vowed to continue its campaign despite saying it was facing online abuse . \nAberdeen FC said the club condemned any such abuse. \nThe Dons had been considering a relocation to Loirston, to the south of Aberdeen, but the proposal was marred by planning difficulties. \nChairman Stewart Milne has described Kingsford as \"an ideal location for supporters\".
