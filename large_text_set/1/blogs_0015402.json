Thanks for your reaction Don’t forget to share this with your friends! ← Use Arrows Keys → 1 We Dare You to Find Something Wrong With Joan Smalls's Street Style — It's Impossible \nJoan Smalls doesn't believe in crazy, elaborate model-off-duty style — she's a jeans and t-shirt kind of gal, just like you. Every time we see photos of the Puerto Rican stunner, who has walked the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the past six years , outside of the most exclusive fashion shows in New York City, Milan, and Paris, it's not in crazy expensive and unwalkable heels or dresses worthy of a red carpet. \nSure, the model's closet has plenty of sexy Balmain pieces and skin-showing looks , but Joan always chooses comfy pieces (ripped jeans, combat boots, sweatshirts, sneakers) that you too own and love to wear when not at work. Straight ahead, you'll find some of Joan's most real looks that'll serve plenty of inspiration for your outfit this weekend.
