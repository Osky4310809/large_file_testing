While with Leo Burnett he led the rebranding of Fifth Third Bank and the communication platform development for Sprint’s 4G LTE Network. Before joining Leo Burnett he spent around two and a half years with Digitas as vice president, director of marketing, following two years client-side as director of marketing for Ann Taylor Loft. Before that he served as a management supervisor for Young & Rubicam and then Wunderman. Over the course of his career, he has worked with brands including American Express, AT&T, Sony, Astra Zeneca, Cartier and Kellogg’s. “Adam joins us at an exciting time,” Cossette Chicago managing director Alyssa Huggins said in a statement. “Many marketers want a ‘right-sized’ agency that can work in a consultative fashion on big business challenges, and then solve those challenges with strong strategic thinking and outstanding creative work. This, plus an expectation of agility and transparency – is something we’ve always offered our clients.” She explained that Friedman’s “client-side and agency experience” and “entrepreneurial passion” made him the right fit for the agency. “In the age of big and bigger data, I am always in search of more modern and human ways to uncover what makes consumers tick,” added Friedman. “I gravitated toward the silo-free environment of Cossette where ideas can spread quickly and the team is completely integrated. The model creates a shorter distance between the insight and the idea, and ultimately the work.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:01:24.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
