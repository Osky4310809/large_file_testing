Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus leaked again in renders and 360-degree video By February 7, 2017 “Samsung’s next flagships will feature a metal and glass sandwich design with minimal bezels” \nJust last week, some alleged schematics of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus hit the interwebs, which gave us a close look at their design. Now, a handful of renders and a 360-degree video of the upcoming Samsung flagships have surfaced once again. \nThe fresh renders of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus reveal a design similar to what the earlier leaked images had suggested. As seen in the renders and in the 360-degree video, the Galaxy S8 duo will feature curved displays with minimal bezels on top and bottom. They will not feature a home button, and their fingerprint sensor will be moved to the back panel next to the primary camera. \nThe Galaxy S8 duo will feature a 3.5mm headphone jack, an Iris scanner, an 8mm thin body and a USB Type- port. They will flaunt metal frames and glass back panels. They will also get a physical key on the right side, which is believed to be dedicated for the brand’s new voice assistant, Bixby. \nIn related news, a new report by ETnews, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus’ voice assistant Bixby will have support for up to eight different languages. The report reiterates that the company is going to unveil them at an event in New York on March 29th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:00:31.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
