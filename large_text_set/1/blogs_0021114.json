So far, he has made no mention of cancelling the trip.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido – RTSWLX4 \n“I have said time and again; Mexico won’t pay for any wall. \n“It comes as our country is talking on new rules on cooperation, trade, investment, security and migration in the North American region. \n“As president I assume the complete responsibility to defend the interests of Mexico and Mexicans. \n“Based on a final report by the functionaries in Washington DC and advice from the chamber of commerce, governors, and so on, I will decide the right next steps to take. \n“Mexico offers its friendship to the American people and its willingness to reach accords with their government: agreements that will be in favour of both Mexico and the US.” \nThe barrier is to cost Billions of Dollars and Trump insists Mexico would pay 100 per cent of the cost. \nRecall that during his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along its border with Mexico: a wall stretching over 2000 miles. \n“A nation without borders is not a nation,” he said. “Beginning today the United States gets back control of its borders,” he said. \nHowever approval of the project as well as its funding is subject to congress approval.
