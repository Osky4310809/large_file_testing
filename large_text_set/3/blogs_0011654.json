A popular beauty blogger (she has more than 3 million followers on Instagram alone), Park is known for her ability to use makeup and hair color to transform into different “characters.” Unlike most beauty bloggers, Park rarely sticks to one specific look or vibe, instead changing her appearance on a daily basis: Sometimes she’s a makeup-free, freckled Asian girl; other times she’s a rainbow-haired, glitter-covered vixen. And she nails each look perfectly. You May Also Like Makeup Popular Highlighters on Pinterest You Need What Park is best known for, however, are her celebrity makeovers, in which she uses everyday makeup products to transform into popular celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Taylor Swift. And instead of \"transform\" we should probably say \"become.\" The results are truly uncanny. She posts the completed looks on Instagram and often uploads tutorials to Youtube to show followers exactly how she was able to achieve the brain-bending looks. Park’s best celebrity makeover is, arguably, her Kylie Jenner transformation: It’s spot-on. To achieve the look, she used just ten products (none from Kylie Cosmetics, ironically), including a range of smoky eye-shadow shades by Clio, Innisfree, and Urban Decay, Kat Von D’s Shade + Light Contour palette , and liberal amounts of Chanel Inimitable Extreme Mascara to replicate Jenner’s signature lashes. The result? Well, see for yourself: Loading Park’s Taylor Swift makeover is equally impressive: Loading View on Instagram In addition to her celebrity makeovers, Park has tons of useful tutorials, many of which are specifically tailored to Asian women (her Korean makeup for monolids video is especially popular). Honestly, Park might just be the most talented beauty blogger we’ve come across yet—and that’s saying something.
