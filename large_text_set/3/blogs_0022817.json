I said, 'Because I'm 41.\" \nThe singer also discussed the band's constant desire to experiment, telling Rock Sound : \n\"Starting from [2007's] ' Minutes to Midnight ' on, it's like, 'Let's take some fucking risks.' If the songs are great, that should be all that matters. \n\"We feel like we're pushing ourselves creatively. If we write a bunch of pop songs that suck, we've definitely taken a wrong turn, if we write a bunch of metal songs that suck, we've taken a wrong turn. \n\"It doesn't matter what style we write in, as long as it comes from a pure place and it's something that we pour our hearts and souls into, we can deal with what happens from that point forward and we're pretty confident that even if it may be shocking to some people - or even everybody at first - sometimes for us it was like, 'We know we're going to make a lot of people go, 'What the heck is this? Who is this?'' \"And we also know we're gonna make a lot of people go, 'What the fuck happened to my band?' \n\"I think for us, creativity is way too big to be put in a box, and for us we're not a one-trick pony. We like to really play with our palette and expand our abilities as songwriters and performers, and that's what we did on this record.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T06:27:00.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
