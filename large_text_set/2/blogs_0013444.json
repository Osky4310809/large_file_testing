Directed by documentarian Michael Paul Stephenson ( Best Worst Movie, The American Scream ), the film not only creates the entirely new genre of “greeting card comedy noir,” it’s also got the sort of dark, deadpan vibe that appeals to our sensibilities here at The A.V. Club. \nAnd, in a roundabout way, The A.V. Club helped make the film happen. You see, after reading an interview with Bob Odenkirk published on this very site, Stephenson reached out to him to invite him to the L.A. premiere of The American Scream. After the screening, Odenkirk asked Stephenson if he had ever considered making a narrative feature,beginning the chain of events that ultimately resulted in Girlfriend’s Day. \nThat’s cool, right? We thought so. To celebrate, we’re premiering an exclusive clip from the film below, in which Alex Karpovsky (a.k.a. Ray from Girls ) presents a down and out Odenkirk with an offer he can’t refuse—triple his usual freelance rate to write a greeting card addressed to a beloved girlfriend. Not wife. Not lover. Girlfriend. \nThe cast of Girlfriend’s Day also includes Amber Tamblyn, Natasha Lyonne, Ed Begley Jr., Stacy Keach, Rich Sommer, June Diane Raphael, Andy Richter, Stephanie Courtney, Toby Huss, Stephen Michael Quezada, Derek Waters, and Echo Kellum. The film premieres February 14 (that’s today!) on Netflix. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:22:45.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
