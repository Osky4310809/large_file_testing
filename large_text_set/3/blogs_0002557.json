And it really is as easy as it sounds. Last month, the coffee giant released new menu items , including two secret menu two-toned drinks the internet is dying over, and two new macchiato flavors, an Iced Cinnamon Almond Milk Macchiato and an Iced Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato. This buy one, get one deal is to help promote their two new macchiatos, which will be available year round, and to say we’re excited is a major understatement. Starting March 2nd and ending March 6th, visit a Starbucks and get two macchiatos of any size for the price of one.\nWe'd like to buy a vowel. A hint of caramel, a sprinkle of cinnamon. Introducing the #IcedCinnamonAlmondmilkMacchiato. \nA post shared by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Feb 28, 2017 at 5:01am PST \nSadly, the deal is only available for a limited time, between 2-5 p.m. to be exact. Although it’s only for a limited time, it’s so worth it to treat yourself, and a friend or loved one, to a sweet Starbucks drink to get ready for the beginning of spring. Whether you’re in the mood for something caramely or coconuty, Starbucks has your bases covered. And even if you can’t make it this week, don’t stress, these drinks will be waiting for you whenever you’re ready.\nA post shared by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Aug 15, 2016 at 9:26am PDT \nCheers to that!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:44:16.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
