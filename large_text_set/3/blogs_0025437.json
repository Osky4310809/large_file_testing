(Photo: YouTube/EA SPORTS FIFA) \nThe Arsenal forward finds a loose ball in the box fall behind him, and cleverly improvises with a brilliant scorpion effort. Olivier Giroud eat your heart out. \nBut in true north London rivalry fashion, Spurs can't let Gunners fans or players have it all their own way. (Photo: YouTube/EA SPORTS FIFA) \nApproximately halfway through the video, Eriksen also finds a ball fall behind him in the penalty area. \nBut instead of producing a scorpion kick, Eriksen takes a filthy first touch with his heel to move the ball in front of him. The Spurs midfielder then rifles a volley into the roof of the net. \nOutstanding.
