He’s been suspended six times since March 2011, and two of those suspensions were for slew-footing opponents. The trip of Kronwall isn’t as bad as those slew-footing incidents, but it’s a little surprising to see Marchand get the benefit of the doubt. \nMarchand’s non-suspension is especially good news for the Bruins, who have struggled offensively all season and enter Thursday ranked 23rd in the NHL in goals per game. Marchand, a first-time All-Star , has been an offensive bright spot. He’s scored 19 goals to go along with 28 assists in 51 games, and that includes a two-goal performance in Boston’s overtime win over Detroit. \nThumbnail photo via Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T01:33:15.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
