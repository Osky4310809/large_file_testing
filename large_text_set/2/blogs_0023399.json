For us to never lose sight of who we are as individuals and who we are to each other. \n\"I promise to learn and grow for you, to be the partner that you need and deserve in time. I promise to cherish all the moments that we are blessed with and to keep God at the center of this relationship and this family. And in all the most turbulent times, I promise to hold on and fight just like we both did at the very start. We will keep fighting. And with this union, and God and our family on our side, we will keep winning.
