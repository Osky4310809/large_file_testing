By Christopher Michel   11:32 am Photograph courtesy of Christopher Michel \nI’m not—and I doubt I ever will be—one of those runners who signs up for marathon races every other weekend. I’m impressed by runners who set themselves huge missions—trying to run a marathon in every state, say—or who sign up for wildness like the World Marathon Challenge , and run seven back-to-back races on seven continents in seven days. \nThat’s just not me. Since I started running in 2011, I’ve been a one-marathon-a-year runner. I’ve got a number of reasons for not wanting to do more, but they boil down, basically, to a matter of time and interest. On the one hand, I love training for and running marathons (heck, I just love running ). But I also love leaving my watch behind, and not training for long stretches. And I love not running too—or, rather, I love doing other things beside running. Sixteen weeks a year seems like a good amount of time to dedicate to this kind of a thing.   \nWhen I trained for my first marathon, it was a fall race—the Hartford Marathon in October of 2012. This seemed like a smart choice—I’d have all summer to train, and I could run early in the mornings, when it was cooler out. Plus, I didn’t need a lot of extra gear (which was a good thing—I trained for that race in swimming trunks and a cotton t-shirt). Sure, it was hot. Sure, I threw up a couple times before I figured some stuff out ( hydration is pretty important on a long run, even if carrying that bottle seems annoying, and gummy bears on an empty stomach are not a great idea). And sure, I’ll always now know the feeling of sweat pouring into chafe-wounds , but you suffer for your sport, right? Plus, I figured that the struggle of doing speedwork in the heat was making me stronger so that the cool fall race would be a breeze. You don’t get that during a winter run. \nI had heard about a few really amazing races, including the Big Sur Marathon —and I knew that I’d have to train through a winter if I ever wanted to run them. This did not seem appealing to me. In general, over the last few years, I tend to let my runningslide in the winter. Why go out when it’s so cold? \nThis year, however, I finally decided to run a spring race, so I signed up for Big Sur, and glumly looked at a training plan that started in January. \nTo my surprise, training in the winter has actually been wonderful! Now, you may say that it’s been a mild winter, and you’re right, but I’ve still run in my fair share of 20 degree (or colder) days. But it’s not just about the cold. Here’s why winter training has been so great: \nIt’s Pushing Away the Winter Blahs Call it seasonal affective disorder, or the winter blues, or whatever you like, but usually I start to feel a little down in the fall, and I struggle all winter long. I think it’s the lack of sunlight—going to work and coming home in the dark is not much fun. Then, add to that the fact that it’s cold, and usually all I want to do in the winter is hide beneath a bunch of blankets and drink hot tea. But having a training schedule that gets me out—and gets my blood pumping—has really beat that back this season. I find myself feeling better, taking things less seriously, and generally in a better mood than I would be otherwise. I know that running makes you feel good, but just knowing that doesn’t making getting up and going any easier—but having a goal race on the books certainly gives me a good push. \nI’m Also Not Feeling So Paunchy I hesitate to use the word “weight” here—I’m a small guy, and I don’t weigh myself very often—but when I’m under that blanket with the cup of tea, there’s also usually a bowl of corn chips, or a few chocolate chip cookies, or this little snack I like to make out of corn chips and broken up chocolate chip cookies—you get the idea. Now that I’m burning a few more calories, I actually feel better—more fit and healthy that I usually do in the winter. And that’s helping me to get out of bed early, and to sleep a little better through the night. \nOkay, the Cold Thing—It’s Way Better Than I Feared Here’s the thing about running in the heat: You can’t really make it any cooler out. If you’re down to a tshirt and shorts (or just shorts, if you’re a guy and feel like going that route) you’re basically as cool as you can get. But in the winter, you can dress up. There’s all kinds of great winter gear that can make staying warm a snap and still give you plenty of freedom to stretch your legs. And to top it off, once your heart is racing and your blood is pumping you gain what my brother-in-law likes to call “the magical ability to make it warm out.” Which is to say, that usually about 45 minutes into a good long run and I’m taking my hat and gloves off because I don’t need them, even if it’s 15 degrees out. As an added bonus, all those form-fitting tights and compression-style gear keeps everything pretty locked down, which cuts way down on the chafing (though body glide is still every runner’s friend). \nI’m Going to Kill It This Summer And finally, the last, and possibly the best reason to train for a winter race: as I wrote in my last blog , I’m not planning on trying to PR this spring, though that’s been a goal of mine for almost every marathon I’ve ever lined up at. Instead, I’m just planning to enjoy myself, have a good time, and keep my mileage up so that this summer when I start training for a fall marathon, I don’t have to try to build miles and get faster. I’m pretty sure that’s what caused me to get injured last fall. And so far, so good. Because I’m not pushing myself too hard, this training has been going really well, and I’m having a lot of fun. If all goes well, I’ll be heading into the summer refreshed, with a good race under my belt, and I’ll be really to really start pushing it in the fall. \nMaybe two races a year is the way to go, we’ll see! But if I go back to only doing one race a year, I may start making it a spring race. This winter training is just too good to give up. \n* * * \nChris is training in preparation for the 2017 Big Sur International Marathon with Runner’s World VIP.
