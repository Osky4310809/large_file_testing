Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. \"We don't need anyone to give us a lesson on civilization\" said the Turkish president, attacking the Dutch. Story highlights After 'Nazi' comments Turkish president now attacks over Bosnia massacre Srebrenica was the worst mass killing in Europe since WW2 (CNN) Turkey's president has accused the Dutch of being responsible for the biggest massacre in Europe since World War II in remarks that will escalate tensions further between the two countries. With high-level diplomatic relations between Turkey and the Netherlands already frozen , Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the Dutch for failing to prevent the killing of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims when Bosnian Serb forces overran the town in 1995. In a reference to Dutch United Nations peacekeepers who were on the ground and failed to prevent the mass killing , Erdogan said Tuesday: \"We know the Dutch and the people in Holland from the massacre of Srebrenica. We know them, how they massacred people in Srebrenica full well. We don't need anyone to give us a lesson on civilization.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte responded to the remarks, accusing Erdogan of \"a disgusting falsification of history.\" In an interview with Dutch broadcaster RTL, Rutte said: \"[Erdogan] continues to push the limits. This is of unbelievably low quality and style. We are not going to reduce ourselves to this level. This is very unacceptable and extremely irritating.\" Read More Adding fuel to the fire The Turkish president's incendiary comments -- made during a speech in Ankara -- came amid an escalating row sparked by Turkish officials being blocked from addressing political rallies in the Netherlands. Over the weekend , the Netherlands refused to allow Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to visit Rotterdam for a political rally. Shortly after Cavusoglu was refused entry, the Dutch stopped Turkey's Family Affairs Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya from entering the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam. She was later escorted out of the country. Violent clashes erupted after the action against the two ministers who had hoped to drum up support for an April 16 referendum to give greater powers to Erdogan.
