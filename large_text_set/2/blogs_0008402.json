The Russian government extended his asylum status to at least 2020, saying Snowden would be allowed to remain out of U.S. bounds “a couple more years” before any alternative action was taken. Or at least that was the Russian Foreign Ministry’s position prior to President Donald Trump’s new budding romance with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAccording to NBC News, a senior American intelligence official with knowledge of of the matter claims information obtained from the Russian side of things suggests a Snowden handover to the Trump administration would be a “gift” to “curry favor” with the new president. An additional anonymous source corroborated the intelligence official’s claims with NBC News, adding the information “has been gathered since the inauguration.”\nThe White House provided comment to NBC News. Though Juan Zarate, a former deputy national security adviser under President George W. Bush, suggested the Trump administration remain “cautious” before accepting any such “gift” from Putin’s Russia:\n“For Russia, this would be a win-win. They’ve already extracted what they needed from Edward Snowden in terms of information and they’ve certainly used him to beat the United States over the head in terms of its surveillance and cyber activity,” Zarate said.\n“It would signal warmer relations and some desire for greater cooperation with the new administration, but it would also no doubt stoke controversies and cases in the U.S. around the role of surveillance, the role of the U.S. intelligence community, and the future of privacy and civil liberties in an American context.\n“All of that would perhaps be music to the ears of Putin.”\n\nIn addition, both the Justice Department and a Putin spokesperson responded to NBC News regarding Snowden’s apparent “gift” status. The former said “it would welcome the return of Snowden,” whereas Dmitry Peskov refuted the U.S. intelligence official’s claims as “nonsense.”\nConsidering Trump’s past statements about Snowden, however, such a diplomatic move on the part of Russia wouldn’t be that far-fetched. In 2013, the New York real estate mogul described the former NSA contractor as a “spy who should be executed” on Twitter.”\nObamaCare is a disaster and Snowden is a spy who should be executed-but if it and he could reveal Obama's records,I might become a major fan\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2013 \n\nMonths later, he repeated himself on the same medium.\nSnowden is a spy who has caused great damage to the U.S. A spy in the old days, when our country was respected and strong, would be executed\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2014 \n\nBen Wizner, Snowden’s ACLU lawyer, said they have “received no such signals and has no new reason for concern.” As for Snowden himself, he has yet to comment publicly on the matter on Twitter or elsewhere.\n(Via NBC News )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:00:17.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
