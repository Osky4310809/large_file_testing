By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 27, 2017 5:09 PM Azam Khan has asked Muslims to stop eating beef. (Source: PTI) \nA nine-time MLA and former minister in the Akhilesh Yadav government, Azam Khan has demanded a ban on cow slaughter all across India and has asked Muslims to stop eating beef. Azam Khan gave these statements while talking to CNN News 18 and questioned why cow slaughter is still legal in states like Kerala and West Bengal. “Cow slaughter should be banned across the country. Why is it so that it is legal in states like Kerala and West Bengal but not in other states,” he said. \nAzam Khan’s response came after a large section of meat sellers from UP went on strike against the ban imposed by the Uttar Pradesh government. Azam Khan, however, questioned government’s logic behind the ban by saying, “So it means that it is ok if animals are butchered in legal slaughterhouses and not ok when the meet the same fate in an illegal place. This legal, illegal thing should stop. All slaughterhouses should be shut. No animal should be slaughtered.” \nYou may also want to watch: \nHe added that many people of other religions like Jains don’t eat other animals like chicken and goat due to sensitive issues. Using it as an example, he added that if the Muslims stop eating beef it shouldn’t harm anyone as it is not written anywhere. “Ulema should appeal to the people that they should stop eating meat,” he added. \nAzam Khan who is a senior member of the Samajwadi Party didn’t attend the party’s national executive meeting which was presided over by Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday. Azam Khan is the National General Secretary of the party while Mulayam Singh Yadav who is the national President also gave it a miss, once again fueling the rumours of tension within the party. Mulayam Singh Yadav had also criticised Samajwadi Party’s alliance with Congress after his dispute with son Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the UP assembly elections.
