If fully passed on to the consumer it amounts to $1.44 on a six-pack of 16-ounce bottles. \nThe company’s decision affects sodas including Pepsi and Mountain Dew and other sweetened drinks like Gatorade and Lipton Iced Tea. \nDemocratic Mayor Jim Kenney’s office says the industry was trending toward smaller sizes well before the tax passed. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos Pilots 14-Foot-Tall Robot \nEarlier this month, Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo Inc. cited the tax when announcing layoffs of 80 to 100 workers at distribution plants serving Philadelphia. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
