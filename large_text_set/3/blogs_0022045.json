(Photo: Jimmy Fontaine) 87 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJames Blunt is a master of writing his own punchlines. \nSince soaring to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in 2006 with treacly love song You're Beautiful , the British crooner has stayed front of mind as an improbable Twitter celebrity, often going viral with his sarcastic tweets about his \"one-hit wonder\" label . \n\"On this week, 10 years ago, your music taste sucked (expletive),\" he tweeted in 2015 to his now-1.4 million followers, with a screenshot of You're Beautiful at the top of the British charts. A few months earlier, when one Twitter user wrote that Blunt \"stopped being relevant in 2009,\" the singer quipped, \"2006, actually.\" \n\"I just use (social media) to laugh: not at people posting, but at myself, too, for taking them seriously,\" says Blunt, whose new album, The Afterlove , is out Friday. \"At the end of the day, these people don't work particularly hard to make their criticisms; they don't drive for hours to see a concert and then say, 'I didn't like the concert.' They're normally (people) who are posting in the dark in their rooms with their trousers around their ankles.\" \nBlunt, 43, learned to face his critics on Afterlove , which features songs co-written with OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder and Shape of You hitmaker Ed Sheeran, whom he'll be supporting on his forthcoming North American tour. With the success of his first album, Back to Bedlam , \"came a lot of intrusion into my own life and a lot of quite harsh criticism,\" Blunt says. \"I tended to be closed down after that.\" But working with Sheeran, who's \"quite a direct lyricist,\" inspired him to be more vulnerable in new songs Make Me Better and Time of Our Lives . \"It was quite uncomfortable for me, in a lot of ways, opening up in that way, but it felt sort of special.\" \nThe troubadour has also learned a thing or two about how to craft the perfect tweet. He shares his tips with USA TODAY. \nBe timely. \nBetween Brexit , Donald Trump's election and a seemingly endless string of celebrity deaths, many people both stateside and abroad couldn't wait for last year to be over. Blunt cheekily embraced the dour mood when he teased Afterlove last December, tweeting, \"If you thought 2016 was bad — I'm releasing an album in 2017.\" If you thought 2016 was bad - I'm releasing an album in 2017. — James Blunt (@JamesBlunt) December 13, 2016 \n\"I woke up one morning in London and thought, 'I should probably announce I'm putting an album out next year,' \" Blunt explains. \"It was just when everyone started to say, '2016 has been pretty bad,' so I thought I'd better (warn) them.\" The tweet became his most popular to date, with 153,000 retweets and more than 300,000 favorites (or \"likes\"). \nBe self-deprecating. \nBlunt scored another viral moment earlier this week, when he shared a fake set list with You're Beautiful written a dozen times, earning nearly 52,000 retweets and 168,000 favorites. Anyone want a signed set list of mine from 2006? pic.twitter.com/Z0tmKIpBtN — James Blunt (@JamesBlunt) March 20, 2017 \n\"A guy made that himself in 2006,\" Blunt says. \"Remarkably, he (lined) up outside the venue and asked me to sign it, so I signed it and crossed out a song. I just saw that a couple days ago\" and decided to post it. \nBe personable. \nMany of Blunt's withering retorts are too NSFW to publish here (\"Depending how disgusting or perverse or offensive it is, you can tell how much I might've drunk,\" he says, jokingly). Just that and a few super models. RT @_idkmatilda : has James blunt done anything other than that one song in his whole career — James Blunt (@JamesBlunt) October 8, 2015 \nBut to ensure that no one takes his comebacks too seriously, he often messages online trolls directly on Twitter, telling them, \" 'It's all meant in good humor, and if anyone gives you a hassle, say, 'Hey, look, we met each other and we're friends.' I don't want to be part of that cycle of intimidation or being unkind.\" Yeah, I bought those 20 million albums myself.
