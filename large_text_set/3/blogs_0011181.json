Umji said she shops on her phone while Eunha plays games and Sowon likes to surf the internet. \nIf you could recommend a must-have app to GFRIEND, what would it be?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T14:31:29.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
