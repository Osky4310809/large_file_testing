Well, the bill made it through the House as well and went to the governor’s desk. \nNow, Kentucky’s governor, Matt Bevin has signed the bill into law. \nAccording to The Hill , the bill “would allow student organizations at the commonwealth’s public schools and colleges to bar gays, lesbians and transgender people from joining, opening a new front in a national battle over so-called religious freedom laws.” \nThe law also allows “students to engage in religious activities and to express religious views in public schools and in their assignments. It would also allow teachers to include lessons about the Bible in discussions of religion and history.” \nThis is the kind of “religious freedom” secular activists have been worried about. These laws give preference to religious students and allow them to discriminate against LGBTQ peers by hiding behind their religion. \nWith President Trump in office, local and state governments are free to pass such laws because they don’t have to fear the federal government coming after them. \nThe war on the LGBTQ community has only just begun and as activists, we are going to have to fight hard to protect this already marginalized community even more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:53:30.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
