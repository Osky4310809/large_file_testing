That's easy for them to say when they're out there predicting earthquakes, describing people's auras, and sensing what Madonna is going to do next. \nMe? If I was asked to predict what day it was going to be tomorrow, I'd get it wrong three times out of five. I seem to have no powers of extrasensory perception, telepathy, clairvoyance, or precognition. I can recall only one time that I predicted something correctly. I had just arrived at Penn Station in New York, and a string quartet had set up to play for commuters and arriving and departing passengers. As soon as I saw them I knew they were going to play a certain Mozart piece. Sure enough, of all things, that is indeed what they played. A lucky guess or premonition? \nMost people have probably had such experiences one or more times in their lives. How about you? Would you like to test the power of your psychic mind - to find out, perhaps, just how strong your telepathic abilities are? \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Classic Novels Everyone Should Read There are several interactive online tests that allow you to see how well you do at predicting or influencing randomly chosen events. Here's how I scored on the tests. Try them yourself and let me know how you scored. \nTEST 1 : THE COLOR WHEEL \nThe ESP Test is provided by the Psychics Directory. The test consists of a color wheel on which radiate 10 colors. The computer has chosen one of these colors, and it's your task to click on the one you \"sense\" that it is. Scoring is as follows: 4 points for a correct choice; 3 points for 1 pie away; 2 points for 2 pies away; 1 point for 3 pies away; 0 pts for 4 pies away. \nHere's how I did: Trial 1: I scored 22 points, which they consider the low end of \"some psychic ability\" Trial 2: I scored 19 points - \"weak\" Trial 3: I scored 17 points - \"weak\" \nTEST 2 : THE ZENER CARDS \nUse a computer set of Zener cards -- a set of five cards, each containing a distinctive symbol, often used in tests of ESP. (You might need to install a Java plug-in to run it.) The computer randomly selects one of the cards and you must divine which one it is by clicking on it. You'll need the Java plug-in to run this one. Here's how I scored: Trial 1: I scored 9 hits out of 20 trials - 125% above chance Trial 2: I scored 3 out of 20 - 25% below chance Trial 3: I scored 7 out of 20 - 75% above chance \nHOW TO DO BETTER \nWhat should I do to increase my psychic powers? I could keep trying the above tests. They say that psychic ability , like many other human abilities, strengthens and improves with practice and exercise. Or I could go to: A PSI-Hitting Recipe which reveals the factors for favorable ESP results, including cold readings -- and even making money, they say!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T18:40:19.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
