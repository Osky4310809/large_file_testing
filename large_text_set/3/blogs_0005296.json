By Scott Mervis / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nOn weekend nights, Market Square fills with music emanating from NOLA on the Square, a bar-restaurant that sits on the block that once housed Harper’s Attic. \nAnd that is music to the ears of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, which plans to launch a new initiative to bring more live music into the heart of the city. \nIn a press release Tuesday, the PDP highlighted a recent VisitPITTSBURGH survey of tourists and conference attendees that “identified the music and nightlife scene as the most deficient category compared to very strong responses to every other aspect of their experience.” \nThree years ago, the PDP explored a music initiative and umbrella marketing campaign called The Downtown Beat, but after talking with restaurant and bar owners it determined that it was a premature given other priorities. \nNow, it’s back on the priority list and the PDP’s annual meeting on Wednesday afternoon, at the JLL Center at Tower Two-Sixty, will include a panel discussion on the opportunities and challenges of presenting more live music Downtown. \nThe panel will feature Allison Harnden, nighttime economy coordinator for the City of Pittsburgh; Janis Burley Wilson, vice president of strategic partnership and community engagement and director of jazz programs at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust; promoter and Point Park University professor Ed Traversari; Spirit nightclub general manager Justin Strong; music writer Margaret Welsh; and Russell Howard, vice president of special events and development for the PDP. \nRegistration is closed for the meeting but it will be followed by a live music event at Revel + Roost, 242 Forbes Ave., Downtown, which is open to the public. It runs from 4:30 to 7 p.m. with music by Two Tall Twins, DJ Soy Sos and Beauty Slap. \nScott Mervis: smervis@post-gazette.com; 412-263-2576.
