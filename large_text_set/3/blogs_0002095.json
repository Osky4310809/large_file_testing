Consumer Reports buys, anonymously, all the cars it tests, and drives each for thousands of kilometres as part of their road tests. \nGetting into the list of winners, the first category is for the best subcompact car of 2017, and that honour goes to the Toyota Yaris iA . The car, which was developed by Mazda (it’s essentially the 2 Sedan), launched by Scion, and marketed as a Toyota following Scion’s demise , is described as a “desirable no-excuses budget sedan” by the organisation. \nNext up, the new Chevrolet Cruze is the best compact car of 2017, which impressed CR due to its comfortable ride and roomy interior. The second-generation American C-segment sedan is also available as a hatchback , which made its debut at last year’s Detroit Auto Show. \nIn the compact hybrid segment, the fourth-generation Toyota Prius took home the top prize thanks to its impressive fuel economy – 4.52 l/100 km – as tested by CR. The Prius also boasted excellent levels of reliability as well as a comprehensive suite of safety systems. \nThe Mazda MX-5 is the best sports car of 2017 as it is “the embodiment of driving pleasure,” according to CR. Other words used to describe the roadster include “spellbinding” and “frugal,” pointing towards the MX-5’s unchanged formula of a front-engine, rear-wheel drive setup, lightweight and sharp handling. \nIn the midsized sedan segment, the Kia Optima managed to beat out the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry with a value-laden package that includes features normally found on pricier cars. The Optima’s outstanding reliability and extensive warranty coverage also makes it a highly recommended choice for car buyers in the US as well. \nThe Chevrolet Impala continues to occupy the top spot in the large sedan segment with its roominess and practicality. Despite its large size, CR describes the Impala’s handling as “responsive and secure,” and buyers should consider the car as a competitively priced alternative. \nMoving on to the SUVs, the Subaru Forester , which is also available in Malaysia, is the best small SUV of 2017. CR commended the Forester’s roomy packaging, fuel efficiency, solid reliability, easy access and practicality despite the large windows and boxy shape. \nFor the highly competitive midsized SUV segment, the updated Toyota Highlander – now with more power from its V6 engine, a new gearbox and more standard safety equipment – managed to triumph over the competition. The Highlander also delivered in terms of family-friendly functionality, fuel economy and long-term reliability. \nAudi’s latest Q7 was awarded the best luxury SUV of 2017, with CR saying it “feels more like a luxury sedan than an SUV.” The Q7, which is available in Malaysia, also impressed with its infotainment system and impressive handling. \nFinally, the Honda Ridgeline is the best compact pick-up for 2017, primarily due to its smart design that makes it highly practical. CR also states it “handles far better than any compact or full-sized pickup, and it shames all non-diesel trucks for fuel economy.” \nWe’ve compiled the full list of winners for 2017 below: Subcompact car: Toyota Yaris iA Compact car: Chevrolet Cruze Sports car: Mazda MX-5 Miata Midsized sedan: Kia Optima", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T05:30:12.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
