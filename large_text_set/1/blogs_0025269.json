If this Politico report is true, it helps square the conflicting reports by Congressional Republicans that they had no input on Trump’s disastrous executive order even as White House officials claimed they did. \nSenior staffers on the House Judiciary Committee helped Donald Trump's top aides draft the executive order curbing immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, but the Republican committee chairman and party leadership were not informed, according to multiple sources involved in the process. \nThe news of their involvement helps unlock the mystery of whether the White House consulted Capitol Hill about the executive order, one of many questions raised in the days after it was unveiled on Friday. It confirms that the small group of staffers were among the only people on Capitol Hill who knew of the looming controversial policy. [...] \nThe work of the committee aides began during the transition period after the election and before Donald Trump was sworn in. The staffers signed nondisclosure agreements, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Trump's transition operation forced its staff to sign these agreements, but it would be unusual to extend that requirement to congressional employees. Rexrode declined to comment on the nondisclosure pacts. \nAhh, the nondisclosure agreements. Yes, yes, so that your bosses on the Hill have no idea what you're doing for the White House. That is just jaw-dropping. \nRemember senior administration officials Sunday blaming the ban's language on \"top immigration experts on the Hill\"? \nAnd then this from today: \nAt least a dozen key GOP lawmakers and aides said Trump’s order took them by surprise, even as the White House insisted that it collaborated with Congress. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s political team sought to reassure donors and other supporters that the temporary ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries does not amount to a “religious test.” And a steady stream of Republican lawmakers released carefully tailored written statements expressing concerns about the order. \nSorry Ryan, you backed this and now you own it, as do the rest of Congressional Republicans. Welcome to the administration of popular vote loser Donald Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:28:45.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
