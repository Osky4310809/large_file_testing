We understand how frustrating it can be when you can’t wear your favourite kurti or saree, but your height isn’t really something you can do much about. However, being short isn’t all that bad. After all, all good things do come in small packages! So, stop complaining and try out these amazing kurti styling tips for short women that will make you stand out despite your petite frame. \n1. Pair your kurti with slimmer palazzo pants. Pair your long kurtis with palazzos ‘coz they are the in-thing this season. They look smart, trendy and suit all body types. Medium flare palazzos that end just below the ankle give you a taller appearance. \nOur picks \n2. Keep your kurti and bottoms in the same colour family. We know what you are thinking. Why stick to one colour when you can play with a dozen? We tell you why — Because it’s one of the best ways to create the illusion of height. Solid colour outfits create an illusion of a vertical line, which makes you look taller. Make sure you wear a well-fitted kurti and stick to colours such as black, grey, navy blue, purple and red. \nOur picks \n3. Pair your kurti with medium flared skirts. It might not seem like a good idea, but surprisingly it works wonders for short women. Pair a long, straight kurta with a medium flared skirt that ends just above your ankle. It gives your petite frame an illusion of height, besides adding an edge to your look! \nOur picks \n4. Team your kurti with slim pants. Smart, trendy and crisp, slim pants are a blessing for short women. Team your kurti with a pair of slim pants as it creates a straight line for the silhouette, making you look taller. A straight kurti will be the best choice for this look. \nOur picks \n5. Don’t shy away from wearing heels. This one is a no brainer! While too high heels could kill your feet, a few inches will make you look tall and stylish. A pair of good heels with a straight kurti will work like magic for your frame. If you can’t handle pencil heels, go for platforms or wedges for a comfortably stylish look! \nOur picks \n6. Try a skinny belt to cinch your kurti at the waist. Broad belts divide your body in half, making you look shorter. Opt for skinny belts instead or wear an ultra chic kurti that comes with a tie-up belt. Go for a belt of the same colour as your kurti, as it will define your waist without starkly dividing your body into two halves. Pair it with a knee-length kurti for best results. \nOur picks \n7. Stick to minimal accessories. When it comes to accessories, less is more! Steer clear of chokers, danglers or oversized necklaces. Stick to light jewellery like a sleek chain with a pendant, or jhumkis with a chunky bangle. Pairing your kurti with a pair of studs and an eye-catching clutch bag is another way to nail a casual look. \nOur picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:25:47.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
