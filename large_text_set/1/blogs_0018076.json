The TACC, which adjusts speed based on the vehicle in front of the driver, also has an update, and can be used at a max 75 mph. \nMusk also said some newer vehicles receiving the update will need to have their camera angles adjusted at a Tesla service center. \n\nThe Verge noted that new Teslas receiving the update won’t be equipped with the same safety features that older vehicles have, like automatic emergency breaking. But the rollout includes the Forward Collision Warning feature, which is designed to alert the driver with an audible sound if a collision appears likely with an object in the motorist’s path.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T18:40:43.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
