The time change always starts on the second Sunday in March each year and the clocks should be set to 3 a.m. once 2 a.m. rolls around (technically Saturday night). Cell phones and electronics should automatically reset. Any other clocks will have to be manually set. With the clocks being moved forward, this means that many will lose an hour of sleep. \nThere are several states and areas that do not follow Daylight Saving Time and those include Arizona, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands. The state of Arizona (except for the Navajo Nation in the northern part of Arizona), unlike most of the rest of the United States, doesn’t observe Daylight Savings Time, and hasn’t for about 40 years. \nSo, where does Daylight Saving Time originate from? CNN reported that the government started using “Daylight Saving Time” during World War I to copy the Germans, who were apparently doing it to save on fuel. The notion was pulled and then brought back again with the idea that it would somehow conserve resources. Daylight Saving Time just ended up sticking around after. \nEven so, Huffington Post reports that versions of Daylight Saving Time started back in the 1800s with a New Zealander named George Vernon Hudson. He proposed the idea in 1895, but Germany and Austria-Hungary organized its initial implementation on April 30, 1916. \nIf you go to bed before 2 a.m., you can always change the clocks before you go to sleep tonight to avoid any confusion when you wake. \nFor more Heavy news:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T08:04:47.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
