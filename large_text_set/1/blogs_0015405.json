The former US Army intelligence analyst will be freed on May 17, rather than in 2045 as originally intended by his conviction under the Espionage Act. \nREAD MORE: Obama commutes much of Chelsea Manning’s sentence \nFive days before, Wikileaks tweeted that Assange was willing to make a deal if Manning was granted clemency. \nAssange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012. The Australian has previously fought extradition to Sweden over accusations of rape, which he denies. \nHe has claimed the Swedish effort is a way to have him transferred to the US, which, as of May 2016, was actively investigating WikiLeaks’ activities. \nWikileaks has not released a statement in reaction to the announcement by the Obama administration. \nVia RT .
