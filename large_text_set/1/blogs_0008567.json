Clary / AFP / Getty Images\nID: 10303714 Moscow has rejected unverified claims about President-elect Donald Trump’s ties to the Kremlin that are made in a dossier circulating among US law enforcement agencies and senior politicians, stating that the allegations are intended to damage US and Russian relations.\nThe 25-page document, published on Tuesday night by BuzzFeed News , claims the Russian government has been “cultivating, supporting and assisting” Trump in the years running up to his election. The unsubstantiated memos also claim Russia has potentially embarrassing information about the now–president-elect.\nIn a strongly worded statement on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the document was “an obvious attempt to harm our bilateral relations.”\n“The Kremlin has no compromising dossier on Trump, these allegations are untrue and are totally made up,” Russian news agency TASS reported Peskov as saying Wednesday. “This is called pulp fiction and [such publication] is an obvious attempt to harm our bilateral relations.”\n“The quality of this paper speaks for itself. [It is necessary] to respond to this with a certain sense of humor,” he said. “Although there’s a sad side to this indeed. There are those who escalating the hysteria and who go all out to maintain a state of witch hunt.”\nKremlin spokesman Peskov says the notion that Russia has any kompromat on Trump is \"totally made up.\"\n— max seddon (@maxseddon) ID: 10303637 Trump also dismissed the allegations, calling them a “total political witch hunt” in a tweet shortly after the publication of the dossier.\nFAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ID: 10303704 Nikolay Kovalyov, former director of the Russian security service, the FSB, also rejected reports Russia’s secret service had damaging material on Trump.\n“Of course there’s no kompromat [secret dossier],” Interfax news agency reported Kovalyov as saying. “Collect some dirt on a man who came here and engaged in the production of some kind of beauty contest? Who can be possibly interested in that?”\nKovalyov, who was director of the FSB from July 1996 to July 1998, said that in his experience “there’s no such practice in Russia.”\nAccording to Interfax, he went on to state: “It seems that the Obama administration has pulled all efforts to compromise the winner of the presidential race, and in this struggle they believe that all means are good.”\nThe validity of the documents was criticized by WikiLeaks. The organization tweeted early Wednesday morning that the report’s “style, facts & dates show no credibility.”\nOn Tuesday, CNN reported that both Trump and President Barack Obama received a two-page synopsis of the 35-page dossier.\nDuring an appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers , the president-elect’s former campaign manager and current White House senior staffer Kellyanne Conway said Trump was “not aware” of any briefing on the matter.\nThese Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties To Russia", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/818990655418617856", "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/index.html", "http://www.interfax.ru/russia/544848", "https://sputniknews.com/military/201701111049466401-allegations-compromising-intel-clinton-fake/", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/819108055568760832", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/818990655418617856", "http://www.interfax.com/news.asp", "http://tass.ru/politika/3931834", "https://www.facebook.com/LateNightSeth/videos/798255053658509/", "https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/818992803829137408"], "published": "2017-01-11T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T14:48:50.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
