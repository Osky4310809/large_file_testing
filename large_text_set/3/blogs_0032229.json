The universe is amazing. We’re not worthy. Long Story Short \nScientists from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Arkansas State University-Jonesboro have managed to take a spinach leaf and grow legit, beating heart tissue on it. What have you done this week? Long Story \nRemember that great thing you did at work last week? The one that really impressed your boss? Yeah, well, you can forget all about it now because a team of scientists from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Arkansas State University-Jonesboro have just managed to grow heart tissue on a spinach leaf and our accomplishments have lost all meaning. We can go home now. \nAs the medical world struggles to find an efficient and successful way to repair and regenerate damaged organs and tissues, these revolutionary findings offer a major breakthrough. Up until now, the biggest obstacle in regenerative medicine has been the fact that “current bioengineering techniques, including 3D printing (of human cells) , can’t fabricate the branching network of blood vessels down to the capillary scale that are required to deliver the oxygen, nutrients, and essential molecules required for proper tissue growth.” \nHow did they achieve such a game-changing feat? First up, the team ran a detergent solution through the leaves’ veins to remove all plant cells. That left them with “a framework made primarily of cellulose, a natural substance that is not harmful to people.” \nNext, the researchers \"flowed fluids and microbeads similar in size to human blood cells through the spinach vasculature, and they seeded the spinach veins with human cells that line blood vessels.” The result? They were able to “culture beating human heart cells on spinach leaves that were stripped of plant cells.” \nAnd because they weren't happy running tests solely on Popeye's favorite snack, they also gave parsley, Artemesia annua (sweet wormwood) and peanut hairy roots a go and yup, they worked just as well as the spinach did. Although human testing is still years away, the scientists are moving full steam ahead. Next on the list is researching how human cells will grow while attached to “plant-based scaffolds” and figuring out how to deal with “outflow of blood and fluids”.
