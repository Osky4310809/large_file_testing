The 860 Special Edition refers to the production total for the SE – 860 units in Halo White and another 860 in Supernova Orange. Pictured here, the latter an exclusive 860 Special Edition colour. \nBoth white and orange cars get black racing stripes down the middle, black door mirror caps, a black rear wing and black-chrome finished 17-inch alloys. Inside, the seats are covered in black leather with orange contrast stitching – this combo can also be found on the dashboard, door panels, steering wheel, handbrake and gear gaiter. \nOn the equipment front, the 860 Special Edition introduces push button start, dual-zone auto air con, heated seats and a larger MID screen in the instrument panel, which includes g-meter and lap-timer functions. Might not sound special, but the Toyota 86 carried over the Scion FR-S’ single trim line in the US, and customers there had to make do with a more modestly equipped sports car. The 860 Special Edition brings kit count to the level of the Subaru BRZ Limited. \nNo mechanical changes to the 205 hp, 2.0 litre boxer engined coupe. 860 SE prices start from US$30,040 (RM133,617) for the six-speed manual, rising to US$30,760 (RM136,820) for the six-speed automatic. That’s a premium of slightly below US$3k over the regular car. Meanwhile, we’ll continue to wait for the reunion of The Three Brothers . \nGALLERY: USDM Toyota 86 860 Special Edition GALLERY: JDM Toyota 86 GT Limited facelift Research Toyota Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T06:25:14.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
