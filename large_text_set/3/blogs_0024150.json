And the tight end for that matter (probably). A cornerback may be appealing, but with all that guaranteed money for Gilmore, and with Butler likely (?) under control for another year, spending such a high pick on a corner would really break the Belichick mold. They’re well-stocked at receiver and don’t typically look to the first round for help in such areas. Other than that, it’s reasonable to believe Belichick does not identify any player there who provides more value to the 2017 Patriots than Garoppolo. \nAs we know, Belichick typically thinks one or two or three years down the road. His Jamie Collins trade was the perfect example. He deemed Collins expendable, a player he would lose to free agency in the offseason. He also deemed his defense good enough to exist without Collins. So Belichick traded Collins in the middle of the season for what turned out to be the 103rd overall pick of this year’s draft. Had Collins left via free agency, Belichick may have gotten a similar pick in 2018. \nAnd, because the sun sometimes shines on Belichick, he won the Super Bowl in the middle there. \nThat must be considered when discussing a potential Garoppolo deal. Instead of saying “a first and a second should be enough to make the deal,” it’s now time to deal in specifics. \nIt’s not as if Belichick hasn’t emerged from a draft without making too many additions in past years. In 17 drafts, he’s averaged nine selections per year. That’s ranged from as low as six in 2002 to 12 in 2009 and 2010. (It’s likely no coincidence that Belichick went looking for so much help in those two particular years. The Patriots were not great in ’08 and ’09.) In years following Super Bowl victories, the Patriots drafted six, eight, seven and 11 players in the following drafts. As it stands right now, they own seven picks in the 2017 draft. It wouldn’t be unfathomable for them to stay at that number. \nThis is also almost certainly true: Belichick will not feel an impulse that tells him he has to get high into the first round. He’s picked in the top half of the first round just three times with the Patriots. In five drafts, he’s made his earliest selection after No. 30 overall. Last year he made his first pick at No. 60. In 2013, his highest pick was at No. 52. There will be no panic in Belichick if he ends up making his first 2017 selection at No. 72 overall. \nThe “theory” of No. 12 overall no longer applies. It’s all about the actual players who may or may not be available. While nobody ever really knows what’s going on inside the mind of Bill Belichick, it’s fair to at least ponder the idea that he just doesn’t see the 2017 NFL draft as being particularly talented. \nYou can or find him on Twitter @michaelFhurley .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T05:16:20.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
