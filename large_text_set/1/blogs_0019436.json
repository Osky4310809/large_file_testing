Residents Travel To DC For Inauguration, Protests January 19, 2017 7:03 PM By Beth Germano Filed Under: Beth Germano , Donald Trump , Inauguration , Lisa Hughes \nBOSTON (CBS) – Packed up and headed for D.C., locals across the political divide were stepping on at Boston’s South Station wanting to be part of the protest or the inaugural celebration like Jack Porter, a self- proclaimed liberal turned Trump supporter. \n“Something has to be done; somebody has to change the system,” Porter said. \nTrump may not have won Massachusetts, but one third of the state cast republican ballots. Betty Veneto, owner of Ginger Betty’s bakery in Quincy is already in Washington D.C. spreading her red, white and blue cookies in the Capitol over the next few days to “Make America Sweet Again.” For her, Donald Trump is about jobs. “I think we need some new blood and change,” said Veneto. “He seems like a get it done kind of guy and I’m super excited.” \nFor the Blankespores it’s a family affair, taking their young daughters not to the inauguration but to the Women’s March on Saturday to lend a different voice about issues. “Women’s rights and equal rights. We want to go and be part of the positive vibe that’s down there,” said Lisa Blankespore. \nHer husband Kevin says it’s an important lesson for their 8 and 11 year old daughters. “We’re trying to teach the kids to stand up for what they believe in even if the election doesn’t go your way,” Kevin said. \nWhatever their politics they’re travelling to be a part of history. “I think President Obama said it best during his last press conference when he said he’s a hopeful person. Democracy is never easy,” said Lisa French who is also headed to the Women’s March. \nSome now look to Trump as a unifier, not a divider. “No question he’s going to change the country,” said Porter. \nWBZ-TV’s Lisa Hughes reports \nBill, Debbie and Lauren McCarthy of Worcester were soaking up an atmosphere of celebration in Washington on Thursday. \n“The excitement in the air is unbelievable,” Debbie told WBZ. \nIt’s a moment in history they believed they would see and an experience in the nation’s capital that makes them proud. \n“I have talked to many of my friends and all of them say ‘that’s on my bucket list.’ And to be here as a 23-year-old and for the candidate I supported, it’s a dream come true,” Lauren McCarthy said. \nThe McCarthys have supported Trump from the beginning and WBZ caught up with them at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland where Bill and Debbie were delegates. \nOn Friday, they will be in front of the Capitol for Trump’s swearing in. “We’ve been talking to people from the West Coast, the Midwest, they’re all excited about finding jobs and it’s already started,” Bill McCarthy said. \nThey hope a sense of national healing comes next. “Obama was not my choice,” Debbie McCarthy said. “But he was my president regardless, he was the United States president and I wish people would honor that on the other side and give him a chance.” Beth Germano Follow Follow Beth on Twitter Emmy award-winning Beth Germano is a general assignment reporter for WBZ-TV News.
