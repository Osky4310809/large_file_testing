Janelle Shoihet, in an emailed statement said the national police force is responsible for ensuring the safety of “internationally protected persons,” in conjunction with local police. It will be the Vancouver Police Department’s responsibility for “public order issues” and municipal bylaw infractions.\n“In an event of unlawful acts, including public order issues, police will respond collectively in an appropriate and professional manner,” Shoihet said in the statement.\nVancouver police declined to answer any questions citing that “it would be counterproductive to share our plans in advance of events we may be preparing for,” according to an emailed statement from VPD spokesman Const. Jason Doucette.\nThere are at least two planned protests for the day of the Trump International Hotel & Tower’s grand opening, one by Occupy Vancouver and a Resist 4 Peace march, according to events posted to Facebook, with just over 600 people saying they will attend and another 4,000 clicking on their “interested” button.\nAnd those will likely factor into the risk assessment for the Trumps’ visit, which was probably completed some time ago already, said Leo Knight, a former police officer and security expert.\n“The police and the Secret Service will liaise with each other, they’ll have the latest intelligence analysis and all that stuff,” Knight said. “Then they’ll decide a security level for (the visit). It’s a movable scale, depending the situation.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:44:11.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
