Harry Roque of Kabayan party-list filed another ethics complaint against Sen. Leila De Lima who described it as an effort to score \"cheap brownie points.\" Facebook/Harry Roque \nMANILA, Philippines — Kabayan party-list Rep. Harry Roque filed on Thursday another ethics complaint against Sen. Leila De Lima supposedly for conspiring to oust him from his seat and for her “unparliamentary conduct” due to her illicit relationship with her former body guard. \nIn an interview with reporters after filing the complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee, Roque said that he based his case on the plot of De Lima and Rep. Ron Salo, also of Kabayan, to oust him from the party. \nRoque was among members of the House of Representatives who questioned Ronnie Dayan, former driver and alleged bagman of De Lima, on his past relationship with the former justice secretary. \nHis own party-list launched an investigation against him for his \"indecency\" during a House inquiry into the proliferation of illegal drugs at the National Bilibid Prisons (NBP). \nThe second basis of his complaint, according to Roque, was De Lima’s “unparliamentary conduct” stemming from her liaison with Dayan which enabled her former driver to participate in the illegal drugs trade at the NBP. \n“De Lima and Rep. Ron Salo conspired to oust me from Congress in order to stop me from investigating De Lima’s involvement in the NBP illegal drug trade,” Roque said in his complaint.   \nDe Lima denied knowing Salo and said that she had not worked with him. \n“First of all, I don’t know Mr. Ron Salo, except for what I read in the news. I don’t recall any instance that I have ever worked or dealt with him,” she said in a statement. \nDe Lima also castigated Roque for dragging her name into their intra-party dispute, saying that he should face his legal problems and fight his own battles “honorably.” \n“I'm sorry to hear that he has been expelled from his party. Maybe if he served his party better rather than wasting his time on baseless and inane attacks against me, he wouldn't have lost his constituents,” the former justice secretary said. \nKabayan party-list removed Roque as its first nominee in the House of Representatives in January because of the questions he asked during the House investigation into the drug trade at the NBP. Specifically, the group used the \"vulgar and sexist\" remarks of Roque as basis for his ouster. \nKabayan officials questioned Roque’s behavior because such questions allegedly tarnished the group’s principled advocacies. \nRoque dismissed the ouster as simply a plot for “media mileage, not the interest of the party.” \n“My alleged ouster from my party-list is of no moment, having been done in violation of the constitution and by-laws of the party itself, and by people who have usurped functions of the incumbent executive committee,” Roque said in reaction to his removal. \nREAD: Party-list ousts Roque as representative \nRoque also claimed that De Lima lied to the public by concealing her “romantic relationship” with Dayan. He said that the disclosure of the relationship was important because it showed how the senator operated her “illegal financing activities.” \n“It was through this intimacy that Ronnie Dayan was able to gain access to Respondent De Lima than no other messenger, driver or co-conspirator can, which led to the success of their criminal design,” the complaint read. \nRoque told reporters: “At hindi naman gagawin ni Ronnie Dayan ‘yong pangongolekta ng pera, pag-oorder na mangalakal ng drog sa Muntinlupa kung hindi dahil doon sa domestic relationship nila.” \nREAD: Dayan now in witness protection house \nRoque claimed in his complaint that De Lima and Salo connived to oust him from his seat through BuCor Love Foundation. Salo was elected chairman of the board of trustees of the foundation, the complaint alleged. It also said that Salo was the chairman of the BuCor Love when De Lima was the justice secretary. \nAccording to Roque, BuCor Love Foundation owns the recording studio where inmate Herbert Colanggo held office. This was also where De Lima received money from Colanggo in one instance, Roque claimed. \n“At kung ipagtatagpi-tagpi mo nga ang naging findings ng Camara de Representates, ‘yong papel ni Colanggo, ‘yong kanyang opisina, ‘yong recording studio na inaangkin nitong BuCor Love Foundation, malinaw po na unang-una, mayroong propesyonal na relasyon na hindi po isiniwalat din either sa Camara o sa Senado between ‘yong Salot ng buhay ko [Salo] at ni Senator Leila de Lima,” he said. \nDe Lima branded the complaint as an effort by Roque “to be relevant and be in the news again.” She said that if he wanted this, he should not involve her anymore. \n“I have no interest in meddling with their internal party affairs,” De Lima asserted. \nShe advised Roque: “My advice to him is to focus on working on meaningful legislation rather than politicking. He won't find salvation by trying to score cheap brownie points from the president by attacking me.” \nRoque also expressed his impatience over time the Department of Justice (DOJ) is taking to release its findings on the criminal charges against the senator. \n“Natatagalan ako. Matagal nang dapat nakulong si Leila De Lima,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:26:07.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
