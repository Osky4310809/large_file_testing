I felt like it would be thrilling to build a kiln in, what was at the time much more so than it is now, the hood. So we built this kiln.\" After 48 hours, the kiln produces new objects like these.

Made with two dome like structures at its top, that spew fire and smoke when fully stocked with doors bricked up, a traditional combustion chamber is created, turning any clay object into a brand new ceramic.

It's very hard to say that this is what you're going to get and so you have to sort of submit yourself to the process.\" \nUnlike an electric kiln, where the result is more an industrial process of uniformed pieces, a wood-burning kiln's outcome is unpredictable. Salt is placed inside to assist with production. \n\"So if I don't glaze something in the kiln, the kiln will glaze it for me,\" explains Crissman. Some busts.

Members of the community, some artists and others not, gathered for the firing, returning two days later to collect their pieces. \n\"We're making cups and bowls, everyone knows what those are, so it's this awesome access point,\" says Crissman. \"There's such a spectrum of people that live in this neighborhood. Maybe I don't have so much in common with everyone in terms of my socio-economic background or my interests, but everyone drinks out of a cup or eats off of a plate.\" Perfectly glazed teacup.

Great stories are told around the bonfire, but really great stories are told around the kiln fire.\" An urn for modern times.
