Now, 10 years after her landmark report, she is still fighting to reform women’s prisons Baroness Corston at home in Gloucestershire.

Ten years on, she is dismayed that the conditions she revealed still thrive. \nBaroness Corston, 74, a Labour peer, is self-deprecating, funny and warm. She is also furious at what is happening to prisons in England and Wales: chronically short-staffed, plagued by violence, overcrowding and fear in men’s prisons and by self-harm, addiction and reoffending in the 5% of the prison population that is female; a system conspicuously failing to rehabilitate or deliver justice. \nIn 2006, Corston headed a review of women’s prisons that was triggered after six women in HMP Styal, Cheshire, killed themselves in the space of just 13 months. Last year 12 women killed themselves in prison in England and Wales, double the number when Corston first visited half a dozen women’s prisons, shocked by the scale of mental illness, abuse and deprivation. \nOn the publication of her report on 13 March 2007, she said: “It is timely to bring about a radical change.” \nCorston made 43 recommendations in her report, of which 40 were accepted; it received cross-party support, but Labour rejected her demand that existing women’s prisons be replaced by small custodial units – a policy that was, however, subsequently adopted by the Scottish government. Corston wanted most women prisoners to serve their punishment in the community, and attend centres to address problems such as mental illness, addiction and domestic violence that often led them straight back to prison. Labour invested £15m in a network of 50 women’s centres. Today community punishment is proving more effective in reducing reoffending and the female prison population has been reduced by several hundred. \nHowever, a sentence of a few months is still long enough for a woman to lose her housing, employment and her children into care. Corston is patron of the charity Women in Prison , of which I am chair of trustees. Recently a charity worker spent hours finding a woman, a former addict with mental health issues, somewhere to stay for her first night out of jail. That’s typical. Six out of 10 women come out of prison homeless. Women’s centres are an anchor in chaotic lives. \n“The overwhelming majority of these women are troubled rather than troublesome,” Corston says. “Women’s centres turn lives around, but it is not an easy option. It requires demons to be confronted: many women find it harder than prison.” \nUnder “disastrous” changes introduced by the then justice minister, Chris Grayling, a person is supervised under licence for 12 months on release from a short sentence. As a result, last year more than 1,000 women were recalled to prison for minor infractions such as failing to turn up for a probation appointment. Meanwhile women’s centres are folding for lack of financial support. Styal women’s prison, Cheshire, in 1988.

In the first few years after the report, we made progress. I thought to myself, ‘Now I’m going to do something else with the rest of my life.’” Instead, the battle continues. \nCorston was born Jean Ann Parkin in Hull in 1942. Her upbringing was rooted in socialism. Her father, Laurie, was a skilled glove-cutter, blacklisted for union activism and often out of work. The family moved to Yeovil, Somerset, where Corston passed her 11-plus exam and went to grammar school. “I came from a council estate, so they didn’t treat me well at school. When people go on about how wonderful grammar schools are, I want to explode.” \nHer life has followed a feminist trajectory experienced by many women of her era. In the autobiography she is writing, Corston explains how, when she was 14, her mother, Eileen, 36, had a scandalous affair with a lodger 11 years her junior, got pregnant and left the family. \nThe child born out of that relationship was two when Eileen died of a brain tumour. Corston subsequently discovered that her mother had asked her father many times if she could return, hinting at violence in the relationship. “My dad, sister and I coped. My dad was out of work, so sometimes we shared a tin of soup between three. I left school at 16 to work because we needed my wage.” \nShe married, aged 19, when five months’ pregnant and moved to Nairobi, where her husband Christopher had a job in radio. Corston’s first child was born in January 1962. “I asked the midwife what I’d had. She said: ‘It’s a little girl, but she’s dead.’ I wasn’t allowed to see her. She was put in the sluice. It was as if I’d lost an umbrella.” \nAfter returning to Britain, Corston was a housewife for 11 years, looking after her children. “Like many women, I had little choice. I had no childcare.” Sarah was born in 1963 and David two years later. \nAt the age of 28, Corston took an A-level and began an Open University degree to stave off depression. “It was the first time I’d had a sense of a separate identity,” she says. “First I had been Laurie Parkin’s daughter, then Chris’s wife, and then a mum. It felt like liberation. As a student, I was just Jean.” \nIn 1981, aged 38, Corston became a woman in “a man’s job” in the Labour party. “My colleagues gave me a book inscribed to “Jean Corston on her appointment as south-west regional organiser, whether deserved or not”. \nIn her 40s, Corston became a barrister and also a Labour candidate for Bristol East – a seat she won in 1992, at the age of 50. “I always say to a woman who may be in a dark place: ‘If I can do it, then so can you. I’m ordinary. I just don’t take no for an answer.’” A typical room at Styal prison in 1995. Photograph: PA Archive/PA Images \nCorston, now divorced, met her second husband, sociologist Peter Townsend, a co-founder of the Child Poverty Action Group and the Disability Alliance, in 1980. They married in 1985. Townsend died of a heart attack, aged 81, in 2009. “It had been a glorious June day. He’d eaten a favourite lunch of skate wing and black butter. That night he turned to switch off the bedside light and he died. It was a most beautiful death in bed with the woman he loved, but for me it was the worst day of my life.” The tears aren’t far away. \nTen years ago the Corston report demanded “a visibly-led, strategic, proportionate, holistic woman-integrated approach”. This translated into schemes to divert women from prison. In government, health, employment, education and housing departments worked together to reduce crime and reoffending. Goals were set and the delivery of the joined-up strategy was made accountable to parliament. \nTen years on, Corston is still fighting. Now she is battling for central funding for women’s centres so they can be made secure, and a women’s justice board to drive change. But there are many obstacles. Last year the government closed HMP Holloway and announced the building of five small female community prisons sharing grounds with men’s prisons, at a cost of £50m. In a letter to Liz Truss, the justice secretary, Corston said she was “surprised and horrified” by the proposal. \nHer understanding and empathy for women in jail, often victims themselves, starved of choices, familiar with deprivation and short on luck, came directly from her own experiences. They have also equipped her to give a robust response to critics who ask why women should be treated differently. \nAmong the differences she points out are that emotional, physical and sexual abuse and domestic violence, suicide and self-harm are more common in the female prison population than the male one; many women are sole parents and men coerce some into crime. \nShe says: “Treating men and women the same is not equal treatment. How many men would like to be treated as if they were women? \n“It’s a system that sets fragile women up to fail, and everybody knows it,” Corston says. “If we can create radical change for women, then, eventually, we can overhaul the whole prison estate. Women and men and their victims all deserve a better kind of justice.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:20:35.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
