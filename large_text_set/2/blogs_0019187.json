Could you help me?\" she asked. \n\"What's up?\" asked officer BJ Gruber - potentially regretting it immediately as it was maths, with the added complication of a few brackets. Image copyright Facebook Image caption Unfortunately, Lt Gruber's second answer was less correct \nUnfortunately, after correctly answering the first question, Lt Gruber went a bit wrong in the second - but the Police Department in Marion, Ohio, are still seeing the episode as a win. \n\"We are nailing our goals of increasing trust, transparency & being approachable. Still a work in product on the math skills,\" the force wrote on its Twitter page after Lena's mum Molly uploaded screenshots of the conversation to Facebook, sending it viral. \nAs for Lena, she knows she can't always rely on the police to help her with her homework. But she does have a backup plan. \n\"Well, I'd call Ghostbusters then,\" she told Inside Edition .
