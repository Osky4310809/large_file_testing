Schools, communities, and families can find — and in many cases have found — solutions that protect all students,” she said. \nShe added, “At my direction, the Department's Office for Civil Rights remains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools.” \nNew York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called the decision to rescind the guidelines “yet another cruel move by an administration committed to divisive policies that roll back the clock on civil rights.” \nHe vowed to enforce New York’s guidelines on protecting transgender students. \n“I will do whatever it takes to protect transgender and all LGBTQ New Yorkers, no matter what happens in Washington,” Schneiderman said in a statement. “That's why my office will ensure that Title IX and New York’s own civil rights protections are enforced — because policies that ensure equality also promote safe and inclusive schools, workplaces, and communities, benefiting everyone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:27:47.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
