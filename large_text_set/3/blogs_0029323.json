Source: AFP \nAlthough Glenn Maxwell saw the lighter side of Kohli’s injury, mocking it on day three of the Ranchi Test, former Australia captain Michael Clarke believes the injury is “worse than people know.” \n“I think it’s actually a lot worse than people know or that Virat is leading on,” Clarke, who is commentating the series for Star Sports, told India Today. “I think he’s trying to do everything he can to get out onto the park because he knows how important it is as captain to lead from the front. \nWorryingly for India, Kohli failed to bat in the nets on Thursday. He was restricted to underarm throws during fielding drills. \nFormer Indian opener and cricket analyst Aakash Chopra is optimistic the 28-year-old will play in the decider. \n“If he can walk on one leg, if he can play with one hand, he will be playing there against Australia in the final Test match,” Chopra told NDTV. “He also realises this is the last Test match of this whole long home season and if he’s not there, the Indian team will be a slightly deflated side. \n“The news from Indian dressing room is that there is no tear, there is just a strain. If it’s just a strain it is easily curable, you don’t really need to get a break of three weeks or more.” \nKohli is yet to fire a shot with the bat in the series, but the tourists remain rightly wary about his potential to produce a match-winning innings in the fourth Test. \n“Every time he doesn’t get runs, he’s closer to that big knock, and being a class player it’s going to be at some stage,” paceman Josh Hazlewood said. “Hopefully, it’s not this next game.” \nKohli’s leadership, aggression in the field and tactical mind would also be sorely missed. \nThe top-ranked Test side’s fielding standards and body language noticeably dipped when Ajinkya Rahane was calling the shots in Ranchi, while the vice-captain struggled to come up with fresh ideas as Steve Smith marched to 178 not out. Big Show has dig at Kohli 0:57 \nKohli, who hadn’t tasted defeat at home in his stint as Test captain prior to the series-opening boilover in Pune, would naturally be desperate to play. But he knows Australia will have no hesitation testing out his injury, especially if the Dharamsala pitch offers as much pace and bounce as the curator is predicting. \n“If players have got upper body injuries then sometimes you’re trying to bowl some short balls to them and make them move quickly,” Australia bowling coach David Saker said during the third Test. \nIyer is uncapped at international level but boasts serious form against Australia, having finished 202 not out while batting for India A during the visitors’ only tune-up for the current series. \nThe 22-year-old hammered the first ball he faced, delivered by Nathan Lyon, for six and proceeded to score with minimal fuss and maximum style. Iyer claimed after day two of the three-day game was sledged by David Warner and Matthew Wade during his knock. Pujara backs under fire Kohli 0:39 \n“A bit of sledging keeps happening from behind, so that also keeps playing into your mind. You have to handle all kinds of pressure,” Iyer said. “They keep talking: ‘this guy doesn’t know how to play defensive strokes, he can’t defend the ball’“So I was proving them wrong. I was just focusing on my batting. \n“I’ve been to Australia for India A tour, so I’m quite used to it.” \n– With AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:20:02.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
