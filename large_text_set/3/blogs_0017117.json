The material was previously used for the expensive 1967 musical flop Doctor Dolittle starring Rex Harrison, as well as the looser contemporary 1998 remake starring Eddie Murphy, which spawned a 2001 sequel Doctor Dolittle 2 , as well as several direct-to-video follow-ups starring Kyla Pratt. \nUniversal won the rights to make The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle after a heated bidding war between studios last week. Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum are producing the film for their Roth/Kirschenbaum Films, alongside Susan Downey for Team Downey. \nDowney will next be seen reprising his signature role as Tony Stark/Iron Man in the upcoming Marvel Studios/Sony tentpole Spider-Man: Homecoming , and is currently in the midst of the epic year-long shoot for Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War as well as its sequel. \n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:47:03.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
