Nick had three great dates planned this week, which were basically a wedding, a honeymoon and a breakup. Corinne cemented her villain status, of which her “dad would be proud,” and Liz finally had the conversation with Nick she’d waited nine months for, and it went … well, we’ll get there. \nBefore we do, we need to talk about Nick’s first group date! PHOTOS: 'The Bachelor' Season 21: Meet Nick Viall's Bachelorettes! \nHello, Girls! \nThe date card, addressed to Corinne, Vanessa, Sarah, Alexis, Hailey, Lacey, Brittany, Jasmine, Raven, Danielle L., Taylor and Elizabeth, read, “Always a bridesmaid.” This did not sound promising for a group of women hoping to find their husband, and it wasn’t. Nick took them to a wedding photo shoot, where some were brides and the rest were bridesmaids. \nCorinne was obsessed with kissing Nick again. When she realized every other woman was also kissing Nick during their shoots (“Tastes like Danielle!” Lacey quipped after settling for sloppy seconds), and also that Brittany’s Adam and Eve-themed wedding meant she would be posing topless with Nick, Corinne decided to aim higher.   \nLuckily, Corinne was already in a bikini top for her beach-themed wedding. Once her shoot began, she unbuttoned Nick’s top, then whipped off her own. She turned to face the women, boobs blazing, and told Nick to grab them. And he did. That’s right: Nick and Corinne went to second base in front of everyone. All of the women were horrified and couldn’t look, but also couldn’t stop looking. Corinne later raved, “No one has ever held my boobs like that. No one ever will.” \nThanks to this “daring” move, the photographer deemed Corinne the winner of the date, which meant they got an extra photo shoot. But really, the winner of the date was Alexis, who took her shotgun-themed wedding so seriously that she maintained a hick accent while cradling her fake baby bump throughout the afternoon.

Soon after, Corinne missed Nick, so she interrupted Alexis’ time for round two before all the other women had round one. Then, Corinne took Us into uncharted territory when she stole Nick again — from Taylor — for round three. \nTaylor stole Nick back from Corinne after a few minutes, which Corinne prompted her to coin the term “re-interrupting.” She deemed it pointed and incredibly offensive. \nCorinne confronted Taylor, asking if there was a situation. Taylor said there wasn’t. Corinne replied, “As long as there’s no situation about the situation, we’re OK.” Taylor insisted she was OK, which Corinne said she wanted, but we could tell Corinne definitely didn’t want Taylor to be OK, so Corinne made it not OK by lecturing all the women about being OK. \nRegardless, Nick gave Corinne the rose. It’s too early in the season to lose faith in Nick, so we’ll take comfort in the fact that when Nick watches this episode back, he’ll see that Raven delivered this burn: “If Nick likes someone who is just leading with their sexuality, no wonder it’s his fourth time.” PHOTOS: 10 Times 'The Bachelor' Made Our Heads Explode! \nA Classic Bachelor One-on-One \nWhile Corinne fawned over the idea that Nick actually listens to her, Danielle M. snagged the first one-on-one date with Nick. It all started with a helicopter ride, which led to a yacht in Newport Beach. Nick toasted to not being at the mansion with all his other women, and we can’t think of a more perfect first-date toast. \nThat night, they had a candlelit dinner for two. Danielle M. opened up about her previous engagement five-and-a-half years ago, which ended when she found her fiancé had passed away from a drug overdose. Nick was sympathetic, much to her relief. \nNick gave Danielle M. the rose and then showed off his middle school moves by kissing her on a Ferris wheel. \nMeanwhile, at the Mansion… \nBack at the mansion, Liz couldn’t keep her secret any longer. She told Christen about her and Nick’s past in detail. Liz described her night with Nick as “awkward” and with “intermittent sex and talk.” She didn’t make it sound appealing at all, yet still wanted to see if there was something between them, hence coming on the show. Before she could move on, Liz said she needed to have a conversation with Nick. \nThe scene ended with a shot of a half-deflated flamingo pool float, which could have been a metaphor for a lot of things, to be honest. DANIELLE L., NICK VIALL, LACEY Rick Rowell/ABC \nSomething New: Nick Gets Dumped Over and Over \nThe second group date card, addressed to Christen, Josephine, Astrid, Jaimi, Kristina and Liz, read, “We need to talk.” That’s loaded. \nThe women took a limo to a Hollywood museum full of relics from donors’ past relationships. Nick donated the rose and engagement ring he wanted to give to Kaitlyn Bristowe , which he said makes him feel “hope.” Sure, Nick.
