On a recent episode, Simmons’ former masseuse and friend Mauro Oliveira said Simmons is being controlled by his housekeeper.\nSimmons publicist Tom Estey denied Oliveira’s claims in an interview with People magazine . Estey tells People that Simmons has made a choice “to live a more private life.” He says when Simmons “decides that he wants to come back, that’s when he’ll come back.”\nEstey says he’s not cooperating with Taberski’s podcast.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:37:08.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
