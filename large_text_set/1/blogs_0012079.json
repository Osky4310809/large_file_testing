Even though The Donald won the presidency, G-Eazy (who appeared on the song’s remix) said he was “thankful YG made that record.” \nDespite YG’s performance of “Fuck Donald Trump” at the inauguration having zero chance of happening, the offer has prompted more than a dozen enterprising philanthropists to launch GoFundMe campaigns to crowd-source the $4 million. \nSo far, none of them have raised any money.
