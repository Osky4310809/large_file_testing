(PTI) \nAs the crackdown on illegal and mechanised slaughterhouses intensifies in the state of Uttar Pradesh, meat sellers across the state go on an indefinite strike against the orders of the newly appointed Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Many meat sellers have shut their shops in Lucknow’s Aminabad area as a sign of protest. According to a report, a meat seller said, “Yogi Adityanath should fight for the nation, not for gosht. Many people are dying without food. It has created chaos. We will support Yogi Ji in his fight against Pakistan. If he (Yogi Adityanath) fights for gosht, we will raise our voices.” A worker from Lucknow’s Tunday Kababi said, “When meat is not available how can we make Kebabs? People still come but go back disappointed.” \nEver since CM Aditynath ordered the closing of all illegally run meat shops in the state, owners and workers are facing problems. Another meat seller in UP said, “Someone commits mistake and others pay for it. We have to earn our living. So many families are dependent on this. We all have become jobless now. There should be a solution to this.” Sharfraz who sought for permission to use Beef at his daughter’s engagement function said, “We have got permission for use of Chicken only.” According to the owner of a legal slaughterhouse in West Uttar Pradesh, “Government has asked us to use black film on the windows of our shops in order to continue our work.” \nYou may also want to watch- \nEarlier today, UP Health Minister and BJp spokesperson, Siddharth Nath Singh while addressing the media said, “Action being taken against illegal slaughterhouses only, legal slaughterhouses should continue to follow regulations. No orders were given by the government to close down shops selling Chicken & Eggs. Do not believe news of it going around on social media.” \nAfter taking oath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, the state cabinet on March 22 issued a warning to all licensed slaughterhouses in the state to comply state rules. The warning also said that strict action will be taken against all the illegal meat house in the state.
