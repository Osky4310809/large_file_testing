But without reliable, advanced weather satellites, the Weather Service will find it more difficult to do its job, meteorologists say. Satellites supply about 90 percent of the information that goes into weather forecasting models and are key tools for predicting severe storms like hurricanes and tornadoes.\nConrad Lautenbacher, a retired vice admiral who was the NOAA administrator under President George W. Bush, told the Washington Post that Trump's budget proposal is \"ill-timed, given the needs of society, [the] economy and the military.”\nWith the proposed cuts, \"It will be very hard for NOAA to manage and maintain the kind of services the country requires,\" he told the newspaper.\nThe cuts would hit the agency just as it prepares to put its first of several next-generation, multibillion dollar satellites into service, with GOES-16 slated to go live later this year. If the budget cuts are realized and cause delays in satellite production and deployment, they could cause gaps when current satellites reach the end of their service life, which would make weather forecasts less reliable.\nThe budget blueprint is just the first word on government funding for Fiscal Year 2018, and Congress will have the final say over how deep President Trump's requested cuts actually will go.\nAdditional reporting by Mashable Science Editor Andrew Freedman.\nBONUS: 2016 was Earth's warmest year on record, continuing a three-year streak", "external_links": ["https://t.co/MYS28mM204", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/837303324575662081", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/827237025942269952", "https://t.co/8UcwGv5x1Q", "https://t.co/HdwUOvTyFo", "https://t.co/MxC01vsIfE", "https://t.co/hmjSGco2js", "https://t.co/xSoo95dYQB", "https://twitter.com/NOAAResearch/status/834840716694138884", "https://t.co/m5YhBJPjH3", "https://t.co/ZuCq4LvoAJ", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellitePA/status/838147794502234112", "https://twitter.com/altHouseScience/status/828331254756040707", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/maximums?src=hash", "https://t.co/k68AYcaJ1D", "https://t.co/57pYVDJC17", "https://twitter.com/gregoryfoster/status/833137064870834176", "https://t.co/nSLCmGDsIJ", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/837051903204814862", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/834442305184620544", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ocean?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/NOAAClimate/status/828997521456365569", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/extent?src=hash", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/EDnPnbE2.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/sea?src=hash", "https://t.co/CKPG9NCk5E", "https://t.co/gZSqGlzsqi", "https://t.co/IaOiUR91bQ", "https://twitter.com/universal_sci/status/836598086092931073", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/0L6t5xhM.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateChange?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/NOAAResearch", "https://t.co/f2tKyTmQDg", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/836625600328650752", "https://t.co/i0zAmcVan4", "https://t.co/UMQcW1yFrd", "https://t.co/5Eyuy4YjRH", "https://t.co/b8QmCZhUVN", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/831959902771937290", "https://t.co/okJqAnyVx9", "https://twitter.com/NASA", "https://t.co/uVqdhjt5T5", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/03/03/white-house-proposes-steep-budget-cut-to-leading-climate-science-agency/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_noaa-745pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8f186cc541b5", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NNVL?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/828682227202609152", "https://twitter.com/ericnost/status/833118882307174401", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Washington?src=hash", "https://t.co/o28pnPYKAe", "https://t.co/DMJJUu5C8u", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Olympia?src=hash", "https://t.co/phdURS9ggv", "https://t.co/HrsjcWmY59", "https://t.co/ltIuZ2JdSE", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2017/03/04/four-ways-noaa-benefits-your-life-today/#2846939acab2", "https://t.co/DrvHTGMzB4", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/0L6t5xhM.m3u8", "https://t.co/PkpzaeSM9J", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/EDnPnbE2.jpg", "https://t.co/yTLm7e1gT6", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/836580326713475073", "https://twitter.com/NOAASatellitePA/status/831926300918968320", "https://twitter.com/NOAA", "https://twitter.com/Patriots", "https://t.co/zOqJ0FfRGa", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Arctic?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GOES16?src=hash", "https://t.co/VElf5rWo9h", "https://t.co/W9chx3R0Ij"], "published": "2017-03-06T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T01:01:10.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
