Byrd Pinkerton/Vox Hundreds of thousands of people attended the Women’s March on Washington . I interviewed over 100 of them. A 10-year-old girl in a fuzzy pink face mask, holding a sign but immersed in a book. A woman who’d just celebrated her 70th birthday, who worked at Planned Parenthood in the ’70s and marched then, too. A 58-year-old CFO of a small software company who said it was her first march. A veteran from Nebraska who drove for two days straight to get there. What struck me, though, was that so many of their answers to my questions overlapped or connected to each other. The people I spoke to were focused on different issues, but almost all of them were hopeful, and determined to start — or continue — to write letters to their legislatures or run for local office themselves. Here’s a sample of 50 individual voices, telling me why they came to the march, how they felt, and what they were going to do next. Read more of Vox’s coverage of the march here .
