However, it is fairly possible for women to become pregnant during ongoing menstrual cycle. You will conceive when fertilization (sperm meets the egg) occurs.\nUsually, between 12th-16th days of period cycle, an egg reaches maturity in an ovary. Once the ovary releases a sing egg into the abdomen, it is soon picked up by the fallopian tube. An egg stays in your fallopian tube for approximately 24 hours. If there is any sperm present in the same fallopian tube where the egg lies, both sperm and egg meet each other to promote fertilization. If the egg remains unfertilized, it sheds itself naturally outside your body during periods.\n(Representative Image)\nA woman’s menstrual cycle generally last for 28 days, while few women may have a menstrual cycle as short as 21-22 days. If your menstrual cycle is short than normal, you might ovulate soon after your period gets over. Thereby, as a sperm can survive up to 6 days in your fallopian tube, so if have you get involved in sexual intercourse during this time, there are chances of fertilization to occur.\nSometimes, you may correlate spotting or unexpected bleeding with your normal periods. If you have irregular periods, there are higher chances of your becoming pregnant easily as you are clueless of your ovulation date. This means that when you were having your periods, you might have conceived believing that it was your safe period.\nHow can I confirm whether I am conceived or not?\nThe symptoms of pregnancy are very dynamic in nature. It brings emotional, mental and physical changes in a woman. The foremost symptoms of conception that you experience at the time of conception are as follows:\nImplantation Spotting\nImplantation bleeding is observed as mild bleeding in the form of pink or brown spots, which occurs when the fertilized egg has attached itself to your uterine lining. It occurs within 10-12 days post fertilization.\nBreast Changes\nSoon after you conceive your body’s hormonal balance varies time to time. Such dynamicity may affect your body in several ways. This is a natural way of your body to prepare itself for pregnancy. The most prominent physical change is breast transformations. Your breasts may become heavier, swollen and tender. Also, the areolas (area around nipples) turn darker.\nFatigue\nIf you experience sudden energy loss, inactivity, laziness and tiredness, then you are likely to be pregnant. This happens due to elevated levels of progesterone in your body.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T12:17:07.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
