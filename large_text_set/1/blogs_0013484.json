The 44-year-old told ESPN that at his heaviest, he wrestled at a weight of 537 pounds. \nThe Big Show has been missing from weekly programming for the better part of six months — but he recently returned to Raw looking far slimmer than his old self, and he’s under 400 pounds for the first time in more than two decades. \nThe Big Show recently tweeted a photo from a holiday workout, and he looks incredible. \nAfter Shaq made a surprise appearance at WrestleMania 32, The Big Show challenged him to a match in 2017 at WrestleMania 33. He joked that Shaq better get back in the gym, too. \nVia ESPN: \n“I’m a little worried because I’ve heard that Shaq has got like really fat. If he’s going to go into WrestleMania bigger than me, I’m going to lose my moniker as ‘The World’s Largest Athlete.’ I hope he is well, I hope he is healthy. He might want to lay off the cheeseburgers a little bit and get in the gym because I know that my record at WrestleMania against celebrities isn’t that good, but it would be a shame if he showed up fat and out of shape and took the first loss.” \nThe 44-year-old Big Show has been working relentlessly in the gym during a lengthy absence from WWE, and he seems to be making some incredible progress. Hey @Shaq ...glad your training!! — Big Show (@WWETheBigShow) January 15, 2017 \nHis huge transformation led some fans to dub him a “superhero”. The Big Show is now a superhero. https://t.co/3xpnsRdq4q — Bryan M.
