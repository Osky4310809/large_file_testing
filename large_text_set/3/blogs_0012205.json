It was Ben’s choice to receive treatment,” says a source. “She is happy that he is working on himself.” \n“Earlier last year, Ben was doing great. He was making an effort to stay healthy,” says a source. “But then something happened around the holidays that made him slip.” \nYet throughout Affleck’s ups and downs, “Jen was supportive and understanding,” says the source. \n“I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be, ”Affleck said in his Facebook post. \nThough Affleck and Garner, both 44, announced their separation nearly two years ago, they have remained close, living together much of the time and co-parenting their three kids. They still haven’t filed for divorce, and sources recently told PEOPLE that that continues to be on hold despite recent strains. “They have an amazing friendship and utmost respect and love for each other,” says a source close to the couple. \nFrom Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous \n\nIn February, the couple celebrated their son Sam’s fifth birthday together and also spent the holidays together in Montana. \nAffleck told PEOPLE in January , “I like taking my kids to school in the morning and dropping them off and having them know their dad is there.
