Flights to Appleton, Birmingham, Boise, Colorado Springs, Greensboro, Greenville, Hattiesburg and Ontario will begin on July 5. \nFlights to Bozeman will begin on June 2, and seasonal service to Guatemala City will commence on July 8. \nThe world’s largest airline also announced a slew of other routes that will be launching this summer, including Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) to Amsterdam (AMS) and Rome (FCO). New routes operated by American Airlines, commencing this summer. Image courtesy of AA. \nThe new routes aren’t the only thing American is doing to strengthen its presence in the Windy City. The airline plans on building five new gates on the L concourse at O’Hare. It’s been more than 20 years since the airport has seen any new gates. The Admirals Club lounge between the H and K terminal is undergoing renovations, and a new Admirals Club Flagship lounge will open in the fall. \nUnited is headquartered in Chicago and uses O’Hare as a hub airport, while American considers ORD its third-largest hub. American seems to be pushing back against United’s new efforts, as this expansion comes just two weeks after United announced seven new routes from Chicago and said it was done being a “docile competitor.” \nImage courtesy of John Gress via Getty Images.
