Take those images of him arriving at his £500,000 50th bash as a cross between Louis XIV and the abominable snowman, for example. \nToday, as the iconic singer-songwriter turns 70, one can only wonder what he might have in store for the celebrations. \nWith special guest Lady Gaga – his sons’ godmother – set to perform, and a celebration of Elton’s long partnership with songwriter Bernie Taupin, the event in Los Angeles will be quite a spectacle. \nSpeaking on the eve of his landmark birthday, Sir Elton said this one is about giving back. \n“It’s a great year,” he says. \n“It’s the 25th anniversary of the AIDS Foundation, 50 years of Bernie and me, and 70 years of me. Life is fabulous. Life is fantastic and I like to celebrate things. Read More \n“I intend to celebrate it, and celebrate it with thanks and gratitude because I want to live another 20 years. Some people don’t like birthdays, they don’t want to know about them. I’ve always enjoyed my birthday.” Elton John with Lady Gaga \nSir Elton is most definitely still standing. Like so many of his peers, such as Sir Rod Stewart, Sir Paul McCartney and The Rolling Stones, he continues to perform, but with a relentless frequency which leaves them all lagging behind. \nEven being dad to Zachary, six, and Elijah, four, with David Furnish has not slowed him down. Insiders close to the star say he cannot let go of his superstardom and desperately wants one more hit. There are whispers he needs to work due to his infamous spending habits.

Referred to as Yoko – after John Lennon’s wife Yoko Ono – by those who have seen some of Sir Elton’s closest circle axed, it is said to be husband David, 54, who is keen for the star to regain success. \nAn insider said: “The sales of Elton’s last album were really poor worldwide, he’s just not making the right music. \n“The management are desperate for Elton to have a hit and to keep him relevant, but they haven’t got the right music. How hard can it be? Even Dame Vera Lynn is number three in the charts.” Elton John on holiday \nDespite a past history of drug and drink addiction, and having a pacemaker fitted in 1999, it seems nothing can stop Sir Elton. A quick scan of this year’s tour dates reveals gigs from Rio to Blackburn, plus a tour Down Under in September. \nSir Elton says: “I don’t just do a tour every two to three years. I work all the time because I love to. I’m different from Springsteen and The Stones and that. I don’t go out on tour, I am on tour.” \nThere is an enlightening moment in the 1995 documentary Tantrums and Tiaras, directed by David in which the notoriously fastidious pop legend is filmed poring over a print-out of the Billboard Top 100. \nHe highlights every record which has climbed the chart that week, tracking each artist against his own performance. It was weird to see a global megastar still so consumed with measuring success.

He has a reported £100million fortune. But Sir Elton’s last number one was the 2003 re-release of Are You Ready For Love. Since 2013 there have been no UK hits. \nHis last album Wonderful Crazy Night, released last year, reached number six in the UK, but sold fewer than 200,000 copies. He has brushed it off, saying: “I make an album every year and a half, it’s not an event when I make an album.” \nBut he is clearly aware of his popularity.

And the first record to come in at number one. Those things didn’t make me big-headed. Ed Sheeran’s like that. I helped manage Ed Sheeran, he is the same as I am. \n“He loves the pressure. It’s not really pressure, it’s momentum and it’s the joy of being in that situation where you’re like, ‘Oh I’ll just write this now’.” \nThough the source says: “Elton can’t live off his old songs as he doesn’t own full publication rights, so he has to keep going with new material. His huge outgoings mean he’ll keep performing as that’s a big income for him.” \nBut what Sir Elton says of his love for crazy costumes might sum it up: “That’s what an addict does, takes things too far. I don’t regret it.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:54:17.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
