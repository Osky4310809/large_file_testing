He arrived to back-up and challenge Thibaut Courtois, then was pressed into first-team duty as Courtois spent most of the first half of last season injured, but since the young Belgian’s return to full fitness, Begovic has only had the occasional cup game to keep himself busy. And while he’s as much of a team player and professional as anyone in the squad, at just 29 years of age, he simply wants to play more often — in fact, he was willing to even forgo a chance at lifting the Premier League trophy this season to get that in January. Despite Chelsea’s best efforts, a replacement for Begovic could not be found, and so he stayed. Now that his immediate future is set, Begovic has shifted his narrative from worries over playing time to helping the team wherever and however he can in our quest for a second title in three seasons. We’d expect nothing less from the veteran Bosnian international. \"I think it bugs any professional when you don’t play regularly. What keeps me going is the chance of being able to lift some silverware and be part of a trophy winning side so that’s a big motivation for me.\" \"But, of course, I think it bugs you every time you don’t play and when it carries on for a longer time then it becomes even more difficult.\" \"But in terms of moving clubs that is something that is obviously not an option now. I am fully committed to the cause - I know my role within the team and the leadership I can bring.\" \"I am fully committed to the club and getting us over the line, getting this trophy won this year, and then we’ll take it from there.\" -Asmir Begovic; source: talkSport With Courtois continuing to improve and play well, Begovic is likely to see action only in the FA Cup, however long that run will last. But his presence in the dressing room and on the training ground is a valuable part of our title-challenge and hopefully his patience and professionalism will indeed be rewarded with a shiny winners medal in May.
