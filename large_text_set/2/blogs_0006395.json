Jefferson County man beat girlfriend to death, murder charges say 7 hrs ago ( … ) \nChristopher Buechting , of Jefferson County south of Festus, was charged with murder in the death of Angela McDonald. \nJEFFERSON COUNTY • A Jefferson County man beat his live-in girlfriend to death and told investigators she had intentionally banged her head during an argument, authorities say. \nChristopher B. Buechting, 43, of the 1400 block of Wilderness Acres Lane, was charged Monday with second-degree murder in the death of Angela McDonald, 39. Buechting’s bail was set at $100,000 cash. \nAccording to court documents, Buechting called 911 on the evening of Jan. 22 about a fight with McDonald at their home, but then called back to say even though McDonald had hit him with a brick, that he was fine and had left the home. \nBuechting was gone when a deputy arrived. The deputy saw bruising on McDonald’s face, charges say. McDonald complained of rib pain and believed they were broken, according to court documents. She said Buechting had assaulted her in the past, but not that day. She was “not forthcoming with information,” the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department said. A friend came to pick her up but McDonald ultimately stayed home. \nThe next afternoon, Buechting called 911 to report McDonald unresponsive at the home, charges say. He told dispatchers she had intentionally banged her head on the porch the night before, claiming she was drunk and angry. \nMcDonald was flown to Mercy Hospital St. Louis in Creve Coeur for treatment. Deputies spotted blood on the front porch and spattered on the door frame. She never regained consciousness and died at 9:41 p.m. Jan. 25, charges say. Her cause of death was closed head trauma. \nBuechting texted McDonald’s friend that she had hit her head on some steps. Later he told authorities that the injuries actually came following a fight two nights earlier, after he grabbed her arms and forced her out the door. He told investigators he then heard banging at the door and assumed she was hitting her head. Buechting said he brought her back in, her nose bleeding. He cleaned her up and put her to bed, he told authorities. \nInvestigators found a pool of blood on the front porch, charges say. Deputies also found a blood-stained throw pillow and a large stain on an area rug that had soaked through to the carpet beneath. \nBuechting acknowledged that he and McDonald had a history of domestic abuse. He has a pending assault charge from 2015 that accuses him of hitting McDonald in the back of the head during an argument at their home. \nHis criminal history includes two drunken driving convictions in Ste. Genevieve and Wayne counties and a misdemeanor assault conviction in Jefferson County.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:12:42.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
