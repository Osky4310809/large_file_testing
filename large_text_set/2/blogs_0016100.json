Whether you live in Ijebu-ode or Okitipkupka, you are only answerable to the authority that issue that warrant. Two, the examples you gave are so watering, because Ibori was tried for crimes in UK. Jonathan’s uncle(Alamiesighathief) can not go near British Embassy in Lagos because he knows better than you. Prosper \nBecause he took part of the money to UK for safe keeping and to enjoy with his numerous co-criminials that’s why akara \nlolxxx. You no go school?? Ibori laundered stolen money from Nigeria in the UK and that is a crime in UK law. ROCKSON \n“I dey laugh ooo, Kashamu don buy job, u get issue with OBJ-the one and only ebora owu.” This guy must be joking! Well! Nigerian lawyer will get his share from your resources acquired. Food for thought: Let moral ethics have its say in all your dealings. Papaosun \nYou see, the United States administration is not the type you can outsmart as it is done here in Nigeria. All the rubbish people in government do here are so embarrassing that sometimes you are ashamed of identifying yourself as a Nigerian. When Clinton, as a president had that affair with Monica, it almost threw him out of office if not for his wife Hillary who saved him. A former president of this nation told you in private and publicly that you have a case to answer in US and you are saying a UK court had cleared you of the allegations. How would lawyers eat if they don’t encourage such people to dance around the obvious? Bode \nThis whole issue is a very bad reflection on the integrity of Nigeria judicial system. However i will say this, the moment Goodluck Jonathan is voted out of office Kashamu’s life will never be the same for any incoming government may agree to his being sent back to the US. The ruling of the British court is based on the way evidence was obtained from witnesses and not that the crime was not committed. siddonlook \nGo to America and stop wasting the courts time. You committed the offence in america and you are running to London. It does not work that way my friend, for America to withhold certain evidence, e be like say your case serious be that . Factsay \nUk courts jailed Ibori and we clapped for them. Same UK court has freed someone but hypocrites wont accept that. Sentiments everywhere! Same US and internal investigations fingered Atiku and OBj in Haliburton and siemens bribery cases. But unfirtunately, hypocrites will prefer to stone someone who is wrongly accused of drug trafficking in US to some idiots who steal our public money and deprive us of developments. Like Iyabo Obasanjo rightly said, majority of nigerians are brainwashed by idiots who claim to be their leaders kenny \nDon’t mind all of the hypocrites. Why does he need to go to US? The people that stole money in Nigeria are walking the street freely, Atiku was indicted in US and he is consulting Nigerians today because he wants to become the president, Obasanjo who accused him is there enjoying his loots. So why are they asking him to go to US when he has got no business to transact there. Guguru \nThis is why most Nigerians stay clear of the US for their crimes of impunity. They can do their crimes in the UK an get away with it for the most part. Once they cross into the US, the game changes very dramatically because if they are caught, they will be behind bars for years to come. \nHis crimes in the UK have nothing to do with his crimes in the US. One way or another, the US will demand his extradition, and Jonathan will yield to the request. zygote \nYou are correct my brother. Most of them that did drug and Medicaid fraud here, spend years in jail. While in jail small boys will be using their wives to play koso every night. When they come back after 16 years nothing is left. No money, no family. In fact, their children will start calling them uncle. A country where a governor, Rob Blagojevich, a Democrat who won two terms in the governor’s office, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to trade the Senate seat that became vacant when President Obama went to the White House. Is that not what PDP do everyday-send their brothers to congress even without primaries.
