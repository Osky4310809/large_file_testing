That’s because fiber seems to be a protective factor against type 2 diabetes . \nIn fact, a prior study from the National Cancer Institute discovered that those who ate the most fiber were 22 percent less likely to die from any cause than people who ate the least—and that cereal fiber was even more beneficial than that from fruits and vegetables. \nGluten-free foods often have less dietary fiber and other micronutrients, making them less nutritious, researcher Geng Zong, Ph.D., of Harvard University said in the press release . And that could be contributing to your diabetes risk. \nGluten-free foods are necessary for the 1 percent of the population with the autoimmune condition celiac disease. But lots of people without a medical need to follow the diet are doing so: In fact, the number of people without celiac disease who adhered to a gluten-free diet more than tripled from 2010 to 2014, a study in Jama Internal Medicine found. \nMany of these people follow the gluten-free diet for perceived health reasons, but this study provides more solid evidence that it might not be bringing the benefit many think—and may even be causing harm. \n“People without celiac disease may reconsider limiting their gluten intake for chronic disease prevention, especially for diabetes,” Zong said in the press release .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:57:55.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
