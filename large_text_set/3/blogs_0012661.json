We're here to see how Americans truly feel about something near and dear to all of our hearts, something that has been tearing communities and perhaps even countries apart: Should pineapples be a topping on pizza?\nImage: public policy polling\nWhile it's heartening to see that there are more rational individuals in the country than previously thought (#TeamPineapplePizza), we are also concerned about these results.\nHow is that 20 percent of America is not sure ? That's not an insignificant number. If those 20 percent were to migrate into the \"disapprove\" category, it would be enough to tip the majority. Essentially, those who are \"not sure\" have the power in their hands to completely change America's official view about pineapple pizza.\nThat is a lot of power. If you are one of the \"not sure,\" we implore you to use that power for good and for the good of pineapple pizza.\nIn non-pizza but still food-related news, Public Policy Polling also gathered Americans' views on eating steak with ketchup, as a certain someone we all know is wont to do.\nImage: public policy polling\nWe think the results here speak for themselves.\nWATCH: This is one awkward dining experience no one deserves", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/H4mgtt-EWxuQYlQNWG-V_RyI2aE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F415733%2F9e226ce8-3eb9-4b6c-a903-6da10e2eb882.png", "http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2017/03/only-24-of-voters-support-gop-health-care-plan.html", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6-Q9ZkDKnn3SKRogZYOu6oQPwJU=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F415729%2F04d8903a-70b9-42c3-95da-75baea5ec22b.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SJ1yHN3zjr1kXXDilwAEvGtJr60=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F415733%2F9e226ce8-3eb9-4b6c-a903-6da10e2eb882.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/JZe0BEqq.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/JZe0BEqq.jpg", "http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/D6CBcH7Ssh--3ujFyMnWzzf3FlE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F415729%2F04d8903a-70b9-42c3-95da-75baea5ec22b.png"], "published": "2017-03-16T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:18:08.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
