There’s a reason he’s so exceptionally unpopular. \nBut, it’s arguably very unfair to blame his children for what he does, especially those who aren’t playing any role in his administration. \nIvanka Trump — who is constantly at the White House and is basically the first lady — and her husband, Jared Kushner — who is a close adviser to the president — are a different story. \nIf you have problems with their politics, and the way they’ve sought to benefit from the fact “the Donald” is now president, that’s understandable. \nBut Tiffany can’t help that Donald Trump is her father. People don’t get to choose their parents. \nYes, Tiffany is a very privileged, wealthy young woman with all of the advantages in the world. And, your disdain for her father might make you feel no sympathy for her. \nBut she did not run for office, and, unlike Ivanka, she is not constantly at the White House attempting to impact her father’s policies and interact with foreign leaders while continuing to downplay how much influence she actually has (and treating Americans like they’re stupid in the process).
