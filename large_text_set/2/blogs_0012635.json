AP/File photo \nLA TRINIDAD, Philippines – Government forces said a physician and a nurse were among those wounded in the recent clash in remote Namal, Asipulo, Ifugao where an alleged rebel encampment was overran. \nTaking cues from identification cards left behind by wounded and fleeing rebels after the encounter in Barangay Namal, Aspulo on Sunday night, soldiers named physician Ana Marie Leung and nurse Isabelle Anne Ramos as among those hurt during an hour gunfight. \nLt. Col. Nicolas Quemado, commander of the 54th Infantry Battalion (IB) said they found Leung’s Professional Regulation Commission ID card and two automated teller machine cards, including Ramos’ postal identification card at the rebel camp. \nLeung was believed to be one of those wounded in Sunday’s firefight after a villager reportedly identified her as one of those brought by retreating rebels, the military official said. \nGovernment troops also believed that the troops at Namal, Asipulo are top cadres of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army (CPP-NPA). \n“What we fought are the heads of the Ifugao NPA command,” said Quemado. Nation ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nQuemado made an appeal and said: \"We are open to help their comrades, knowing that the victim is a female and a physician. We need to set aside our differences and help each other to save lives. After all, we are all Filipinos.” \nThe military official also urged the families of Leung and Ramos to communicate with them to claim the identification and ATM cards of their relatives. \nAccording to the 54th IB, pursuit operations against the fleeing rebels are still ongoing. \nQuemado said that they are now coordinating with the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLAC) for the possible freezing of the bank accounts believed as being used by the CPP-NPA Ifugao.
