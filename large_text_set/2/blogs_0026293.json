Serbian defender gets wife's face inked onto his torso… and it's TERRIFYING Given how bad some footballer tattoos can be, this is a bold shout - but we challenge you to find a tat worse than this Share Wait until you see what is now under that shirt… (Photo: Photonews) Share Get daily     \nFootballers and tattoos has long been a bad mix. \nBody ink now seems to be a compulsory part of the unofficial footballer uniform. Whether it be an over-the-top sleeve or a crudely covered torso, there are now countless examples of professional players with truly terrible tats. \nHowever, even in this fiercely competitive field, we are pretty confident that Serbian defender Uros Vitas is now the proud owner of football's worst tattoo.

He wanted a permanent reminder of her beauty. He wanted something that would make her happy for years to come. \nJust one question: why would he assume that a scary face with no edges would do any of those things? Anyone else seeing that image on Vitas' torso and thinking of Homer Simpson's make-up gun?
