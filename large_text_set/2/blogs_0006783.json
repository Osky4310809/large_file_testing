Here are photos from each of the Cup tracks. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR Atlanta Motor Speedway Steve Grissom had a frightening moment in 1997, when he hit the wall at the end of the backstretch, sending his car upside down and tearing the fuel cell out of it. Auto Club Speedway Kyle Larson was just along for the ride in 2016, when his Chip Ganassi Racing Chevrolet lost a tire and went head-on into the backstretch wall. Getty Images Getty Images Bristol Motor Speedway In one of the most savage impacts ever, Michael Waltrip hit a concrete barrier at the old Turn 2 gate in a 1990 XFINITY Series race, basically vaporizing his car. That he survived, let alone walked away, was amazing. Charlotte Motor Speedway In the 2007 Coca-Cola 600, Jeff Gordon got turned around near the start-finish line and went hard headfirst into the outside wall. Chicagoland Speedway In 2010, Bill Elliott spun out in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford only to be clobbered hard by an onrushing Robby Gordon, who barreled into him. Darlington Raceway In 1970, Richard Petty came off of Turn 4, lost control and went head-on into the infield wall, which sent his Plymouth flipping wildly, his arm flailing wildly. It was a scary looking accident.   In the July 2015 Coke Zero 400, Austin Dillon flew into the catchfence, came back down on the track and then was hit at speed by Brad Keselowski. Dillon was uninjured. Dover International Speedway Back in 2009, then-Joe Gibbs Racing driver Joey Logano had a horrible rollover crash on Lap 32. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR Homestead-Miami Speedway With the 2016 NASCAR Premier Series championship on the line, Carl Edwards and Joey Logano made contact going into Turn 1 on a restart, sending Edwards hard into the wall and out of title contention. Getty Images Getty Images Indianapolis Motor Speedway NASCAR restarts are frequently crazy. With 7 laps to go in the 2016 in the Brickyard 400, Carl Edwards appeared to have been turned just after the field took the green, triggering a massive pileup. Getty Images Getty Images Kansas Speedway On the exit of Turn 4 in the fall 2016 race, Brad Keselowski came up in front of Denny Hamlin, got loose and went into the infield, ripping the front end of the Team Penske Ford in spectacular fashion. Getty Images Getty Images Kentucky Speedway OK, it wasn’t a Premier Series race, but Ben Kennedy had a sobering moment in the 2015 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race at Kentucky, when his truck climbed the wall and got into the catchfence. Getty Images Getty Images Las Vegas Motor Speedway Four-time NASCAR Premier Series champion Jeff Gordon went headfirst into an opening in the backstretch wall where there was no SAFER barrier, absorbing a savage impact during the 2008 race. Martinsville Speedway Coming to a green-white-checkered finish in the spring of 2012, Hendrick Motorsports teammates Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson led, but third-place Clint Bowyer nailed Gordon from behind on the restart. Both Hendrick cars spun out, and Ryan Newman stole the victory. (c) Scott R. LePage LAT Photo USA, All Rights Reserved (c)2012 Scott LePage Michigan International Speedway In the 2012 Pure Michigan 400, Mark Martin spun coming out of Turn 4 trying to avoid a wreck in front of him and made a terrifying, lurid slide down pit road in the No. 55 Michael Waltrip Racing Toyota, where he crashed hard into the pit wall. LAT South/LAT Photo USA New Hampshire Motor Speedway On a Lap 175 restart at New Hampshire in 2009, Jeff Gordon got away clean, but behind him, at least 10 cars got piled up after Martin Truex Jr. and Kyle Busch made contact. Getty Images Getty Images Phoenix International Raceway In a terrifying moment, the steering wheel came off of Jimmie Johnson’s Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet during qualifying in the spring 2014 race, sending him head-on into the wall. Pocono Raceway In 2010, contact from Jimmie Johnson sent Kurt Busch on a wild ride, but Elliott Sadler got the worst of it, crashing so violently that the engine was ripped entirely out of his car. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR Richmond International Raceway Frustration between former teammates Tony Stewart and Ryan Newman triggered a huge pileup in the September 2016 race at the Virginia short track. Getty Images Getty Images Sonoma Raceway Derrike Cope and John Krebs both got airborne in a savage crash in the 1994 Save Mart Supermarkets 300. Krebs never raced again in the Premier Series. Talladega Superspeedway Brad Keselowski won his first NASCAR Premier Series race in 2009, when last-lap contact put Carl Edwards first onto Ryan Newman’s hood and then up into the catchfence. Getty Images Getty Images Texas Motor Speedway In 2008, Michael McDowell had a one-car version of “The Big One,” with a spectacular rollover crash that sent parts and pieces flying off of his Michael Waltrip Racing Toyota. Fortunately, he walked away. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR Watkins Glen International Jeff Gordon, Jeff Burton and Sam Hornish Jr. had hard contact in a 2009 race after Hornish got run off course and came back on the track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:17:18.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
