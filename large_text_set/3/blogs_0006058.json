They should be made to feel uncomfortable when they go in and can’t find a size.\" \nJamelia has been silent on the subject, but now she reveals: “I haven’t been formally sacked by Loose Women, as other people have been in the past, so I technically still have a job with them.

It’s a lifestyle channel that includes everything from style and health and beauty to cooking and parenting. \n“My two daughters are heavily involved in the production too.

I’m taking control of what I’m doing, though it is a big challenge! It’s hard work so I think I will have to get a new manager. \n“There wasn’t a big row, it’s just I have been with my management for 15 years. They’ve been fantastic but sometimes when you’re in a long relationship it gets a bit boring and monotonous. \n“It was time to move on.” \nJamelia was speaking at the judging of the Mail’s Pride of Birmingham Awards , in partnership with TSB, which celebrate the region’s remarkable people. \nAn ITV spokesperson told Mirror Online: \"Jamelia remains part of the ITV Daytime family and is currently working on This Morning.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T16:20:28.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
