AP:Associated Press 7 Thierry Henry has begged Mesut Ozil to stay at Arsenal and become a legend \nI rocked up at London Colney excited to see one player above all others doing his thing — Mesut Ozil . \nAnd, boy, I was not disappointed. What a player. \nIn fact, the only disappointing thing was that he wasn’t good for my fitness because he kept pinging the ball straight to my feet! There was no need to run! \nWow! The guy was unreal. It was a pleasure! \nArsene Wenger used to split us up into teams for a game of seven-a-side on a half-pitch and if he put me on the same side as Mesut I thought ‘damn, we are going to play today’! \nWhat Mesut sees is beyond imagining. His calmness on the ball is amazing.

People get confused with thinking he’s lazy or doesn’t care. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nWhich brings me to his contract situation. He has said he wants to know if Arsene is staying beyond the summer. Look, I’m an Arsenal fan. For that reason I’m desperate for him to stay. \nBut I understand his predicament. I was in the same situation in 2007 when I joined Barcelona — with a heavy heart. I didn’t know Arsene’s plans, either, as he was coming to the end of a contract then, too. \nPeople will say it’s all about money for Mesut and that Wenger’s contract is a smokescreen. We don’t know. We have to trust what he says. Respect it. Getty Images 7 Thierry Henry trained with Ozil at Arsenal and was blown away by his talent \nMesut has won the World Cup with Germany. But at club level, he has only one title, with Real Madrid in 2012. He will be desperate for more. \nBut he can do that at the Emirates. \nThat’s why I’d urge him to stay and become an Arsenal legend. \nWin that first title. Be the future of Arsenal. Not just the assist man, but the guy who drives the team forward. He can do that with Alexis Sanchez. \nThey have to be at the top of their game every single match. They can be those guys. They must believe it. \nThis Arsenal side are not far from winning the title. \nThey are not a young team anymore. Mesut, Cech, Nacho, Koscielny, Giroud, Sanchez. All the way down the spine they’re around the 30 mark. News Group Newspapers Ltd 7 Henry joined Arsenal for a short spell during the MLS off season \nIf this team win the league they will go down in history. They will be special. Mesut can be remembered as one of the club’s greatest-ever players. \nThat’s a wonderful thing to look back on when you’ve hung up the boots, believe me. People compare Mesut to Dennis Bergkamp, who was the best I played with. But it’s unfair. \nThey are both amazing with great vision but Dennis was different. He was spikier, had more devil about him. \nPeople misread Mesut and think he’s lazy — he isn’t. \nHis running stats are fine. You can show six clips of anyone and make them look bad. \nI used to frustrate people . . . I’d lose the ball because I had tried something fancy and people would say I wasn’t bothered! I was.
