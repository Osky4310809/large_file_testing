Follow me on Twitter @transscribe Email: katelynburnswrites@gmail.com 3 mins ago Trans Girl Rage NO WE FUCKING WON’T USE YOUR MEN’S ROOM I normally go out of my way not to speak for others but i’m making a distinct exception for this one. I’m talking about your fucking bathroom bills that target my trans sisters specifically. Seven of these so-called bathroom bills have been proposed in seven states in the last few weeks. As trans women, we know we’re the targets of these bills, we’ve been targets for our whole lives. When we were kids we were taunted and called girls. We had the shit kicked out of us for even the slightest effeminate behavior. As kids, you threw your worst against us. We’ve been laughed at, threatened, beaten, sexually assaulted. Wash, rinse, repeat. “Faggot” and “sissy” and “girl”, we’ve heard it all. Maybe back then we weren’t strong enough to take it. We lost many friends along the way. Maybe we faked our way through the closet life to appease your bullying. And yet, fuck you, we’re still here. You got such perverse pleasure calling as girls back in the day and now you’re fucking mad that you’re right? Get. The. Entire. Fuck. Out. Of. Here. Now as adults we’re taunted and called men. It’s as if you’ve somehow grown up and never found originality. You tell us to face reality, as if you hadn’t been calling us girls all along. You coerced us into our assigned sex at birth with violence and now you’re doing the same only new and improved and with government backed approval. Fuck you. You preach biological fact right in our faces and expect us not to remember how you were busy trying to humiliate us in high school biology class. Why are you so obsessed with us? We’re the butt of your jokes, we’re the targets of your hate, we are the straw that broke the camels back, we are the bridge too far and yet we still exist. You tell us to man up and yet we’re still here. You tell us we’re men and yet we’re fucking gorgeous women. You tell us that you hate us and yet you’re still sliding into our DMs with “I’m open minded” (that means you want to suck our dicks) and “I’m curious” (that means you want it inside a different body part). Yeah we know what that means, we aren’t stupid. You blame us for losing an election, you claim we’re pedophiles, you claim we’re a threat, you’ve been targeting us for our entire collective lives. What’s your problem? Maybe just leave us the fuck alone already. We are women. We were women when you called us a “sissy girl” and we’re women now when you call us an “ugly man”. And you know what? We’re done with your shit. Trans women have been using women’s rooms without issue for decades. We are women who will use the women’s room no matter what you say. You’ve insulted us, harassed us, beaten us and yet we still exist. Now you’re going to fine us and throw us in jail. When that doesn’t work, what’s next? You see, your bullying hasn’t gotten rid of us yet and it never will because we’re tough as fucking nails. You wouldn’t last 5 minutes living our lives. You come after us because you know we are tougher than you, we have more courage than you. So no, we will not comply with your bathroom laws. We’re coercively assigned male at birth trans girls and quite frankly, we’re done with your bullshit. We are transgender women and we are women. I’ll say it one more time in case you still don’t get it: TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN AND HAVE ALWAYS AND WILL ALWAYS USE THE WOMEN’S ROOM AND NO LAW WILL EVER STOP US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T03:57:58.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
