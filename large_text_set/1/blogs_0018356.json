(AP Photo) \nThe San Diego — oops, make that the Los Angeles Chargers — held a pep rally in their new home Wednesday, and you won't believe what guest speaker Roger Goodell said. On second thought, maybe you will. \n\"We celebrated the Rams. We celebrated Stan Kroenke's vision,\" the NFL commissioner told the gathering, per the San Diego Union-Tribune. \"Today we celebrate Dean Spanos' vision. . . . We're proud of you.\" \nAs longtime Indianapolis Colts beat writer Mike Chappell reacted on his Twitter account @mchappell51: That loud groan you hear is from St. Louis. And San Diego \nSpanos, of course, is the Chargers owner who has decided to move his franchise north to LA after 56 seasons in San Diego. \nAnd just a note to the Commissioner: No one in St. Louis is celebrating. Not even one year after the Rams' departure. \nRams executive Kevin Demoff was among others who praised Kroenke for his \"vision.\" In fact, it was a recurring theme of the pep rally, held Wednesday afternoon at The Forum in Inglewood. \nEx-Rams tight end has emerged as offensive force in playoffs.
