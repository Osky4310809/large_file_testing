The blearing keyboards and choppy vocals have become something of Cloak’s signature at this point, but the flickering dream-pop flourishes are a welcome addition to the band’s M.O. The song’s oscillating tension never relents, with vocalist Sam Tyndall’s brooding lyrics locking the whole affair in the shadows: “Oh love my love just taste the blood and severing/ Just consider it our wedding ring/ Promise me.” I mean, damn. Yet credit to Cloak for making all this sound not dispiriting, but impossibly empowering. Listen below. \nWe Will All Be Equal Soon is out 5/19. Pre-order it here . The band is playing a record release show May 27th at St. Vitus in Brooklyn alongside Mass Gothic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:46:02.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
