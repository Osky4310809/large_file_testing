I’m not making fun of Hip Hop or being disrespectful. It’s not play rap, it’s as real as anything.” \nMuch of the criticism has come from Yachty being honest about not being familiar with legends including 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G. He explains that every genre, using the example of rock music, has different sounds and layers, so he is confused as to why Hip Hop has to be “hardcore, street, storytelling, the struggle.” \n“People say I’m destroying Hip Hop, and I’m like, there’s so much Hip Hop, and it’s so popular, so I don’t know why I have the power to destroy it,” he says. \nTeenage Emotions will come after Yachty dropped his Lil Boat mixtape in March and then signed to Quality Control .
