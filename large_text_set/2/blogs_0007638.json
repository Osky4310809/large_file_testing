Courtesy of Instagram/ @kyliecosmetics \nBy Marissa Muller. \nLast month, Kylie Jenner finally put that Kylie Cosmetics lawsuit drama to rest, but now, it looks like her brand might be coming under fire once more. Recently, fans began accusing Kylie of repackaging an old Lip Kit and reselling it as a new shade. The color in question is Blitzen, one of the releases in her limited-edition holiday collection . The accusation is that Blitzen is exactly the same as a shade as Spice, which is a color in Kylie's main collection. \nThe possible rebranding of Spice as Blitzen rubs fans the wrong way, not only because it feels deceptive to them, but also because there’s a price difference between the two raspberry-toned plum shades. Spice, which is sold as a lipstick and lip liner duo, retails for $29, while Blitzen, which was sold as a 4-piece matte lipstick kit during the holidays, retailed for $45. While we see the $16 markup as fair considering the holiday kit included twice as much product, Kylie Cosmetics fans are still irked. To many of them, pricey, “limited-edition” products shouldn't already be sitting in their collections. \nHere's what fans had to say on Twitter about the issue as far back as November when the holiday lip kit was first released.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:38:40.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
