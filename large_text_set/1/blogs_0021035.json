The couple is taking over the 35 Downing St. space that is currently home to Blue Ribbon Bakery Kitchen , set to close at the end of January . The square-pizza duo announced the opening earlier today on the restaurant’s Instagram: A photo posted by Emmy Squared ❤️E (@emmysquaredpizza) on Jan 24, 2017 at 12:37pm PST No word yet on how the menu at Emmy Squared West Village will differ from the original, but fans are sure to find pizzas like the namesake Emmy with mozzarella, banana peppers, onions, and ranch or perhaps a version of the Matt Hyland’s popular burger . When Blue Ribbon Bakery Kitchen opened in 1997, brothers Eric and Bruce Bromberg had spent the previous two years restoring a nearly 150-year-old wood fired oven that they found in the basement of this building. For almost two decades, the oven has been cranking out matzoh, rye, and challah breads at Blue Ribbon. Emmy, which notably uses a gas-fired convection oven at the Brooklyn original (allowing for more stable temperatures than wood), will likely inherit the historic oven. Eater has reached out to the Emmy Squared team and will update when more information becomes available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:42:56.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
