After DeMarcus Cousins was traded over the All-Star break, we anointed them as the new favorites to sneak into the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference — because, of course, it wouldn’t be Denver.\nJusuf Nurkic , arriving in Portland from Denver, began playing absolutely inspired basketball which we hadn’t seen all season out of him. With a center who finally seemed worth a damn, and a roster that had snagged the No. 5 seed a season ago, this was the new favorite team. Not the Nuggets .\nMinnesota has been playing basketball that could only be categorized as exceedingly toasty . Man, that was such an obnoxious way for me to say the Timberwolves have been hot. They’ve seen odds mostly go against them this year, frequently losing games by close scores and winning them by large margins.\nMaybe, we speculated, they could finally put it together in the final month of the season and surge back into a playoff team. Someone had to attempt to upset the Warriors in the first round, and maybe this was going to be the team, because surely it wasn’t going to be Denver.\nBut have we considered it might just be that? Because the Nuggets don’t seem too pleased with giving up the No. 8 seed anymore.\nSubscribe to Good Morning It’s Basketball NBA news and links delivered to your inbox each weekday, so you never miss out.\nYour email address Subscribe By signing up you agree to our terms of use . It’s an extreme generalization to say that you , dear reader, thought any of those things about the teams listed above. But it’s fair to say that all three squads — and the Mavericks , too, who have been revitalized since Seth Curry’s entrance into the starting lineup in January — have earned buzz, and that a playoff push into the final spot in the West has been discussed as a possibility.\nSure, it’s possible. But it’s also possible that Denver just won’t give it up, and its win on Thursday — a 129-114 victory against a fellow West playoff team, the Clippers — showed just that.\nFancy rhetoric aside, here’s how the playoff picture really looks.\nDenver sits at 33-35, which is 2.5 games ahead of Portland, 3.5 up on Dallas, and 4.5 in advance of Minnesota. The Pelicans have firmly spun out, not mathematically eliminated but the closest thing to it. Sure, Portland still has a chance. (Dallas has a tough final month of regular season games, and Minnesota would need to make up a lot of ground.) But right now, this is Denver’s spot to lose. The Nuggets don’t seem too interested in doing that.\nThey are a ragtag bunch, and they’re not a traditional playoff team in the sense they’ll probably finish a game or two under .500. That may factor into why some of us never trusted them to hang onto the spot. But right now, with all the evidence we have at hand, you’d be foolish not to trust them with that final spot.\nThe Warriors are back on track, or something like that Briefly, Golden State was tied with San Antonio for the No. 1 seed — which the Spurs own the tiebreaker for now. They were fighting through Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson slumps, and they were struggling to beat even bad teams like Philadelphia.\nApparently, all they needed was a game against Orlando to finally turn that around. Thompson scored 21 points in the first quarter while the Warriors blew the doors off them in a 30-point defeat that wasn’t even as close as the final score would indicate. Like, they probably could have won by 60 if they really wanted to.\nThe Warriors even survived a brief Curry injury scare, which manifested in the form of beat writers saying he had gone down without contact, only for us to collectively exhale when we realized he stepped on someone’s foot. Curry quickly returned from the locker room and no harm was done.\nCleveland gives one up as soon as it gets one back The Cavaliers saw Kevin Love return on Thursday after missing 13 straight games with an arthroscopic knee injury, and for a moment, they were a sore Kyle Korver foot away from being a totally healthy team again.\nUnfortunately, the universe wouldn’t allow that to happen — Iman Shumpert left the game early, and then Kyrie Irving exited with a (hopefully) minor knee injury. We’ll see if either of those linger for the Cavaliers at all this season.\nThursday’s best play: Good lawd, Russ.\nThursday’s final scores Nets 121, Knicks 110 ( Nets Daily recap | Posting & Toasting
