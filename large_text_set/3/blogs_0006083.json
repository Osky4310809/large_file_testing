Why Congress should not ally with AAP in Punjab Hung house on cards? Why Congress should not ally with AAP in Punjab The exit polls for the Punjab elections 2017 predicted a hung assembly yesterday. Should it come to pass, the situation would be dense with both Congress and AAP trying to form a coalition government By: FE Online | Published: March 10, 2017 12:43 PM \nThe exit polls for the Punjab elections 2017 predicted a hung assembly yesterday. Barring the C-Voter Exit Polls , which predicted an AAP victory with 59-67 seats, the all others showed the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress neck to neck in the state assembly elections. Now, exit polls are not always a clear indicator of the things to come, but they do present a general picture of what is likely to happen. The BJP -SAD alliance, as predicted by almost all exit polls, could be taking its last breath. Meanwhile, the competition between the Congress and the AAP is unprecedented and Punjab, as a result, would be a hung assembly unless a coalition government is formed. Congress has been known to make unlikely alliances in the past, the pact with Samajwadi Party after a decade of playing nasty being one of them. So it is quite possible that the Congress might try and form and alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party. \nAnd here’s why it should not: \n1) The Aam Aadmi Party was formed by the members of the Anna Hazare protest, during the fag end of the Congress rule. Kejriwal, along with Anna Hazare had started the fight against ‘corruption of the government.’ \n2) Congress leaders have alleged that the BJP SAD alliance did not want the Aam Aadmi Party to win and considering that they knew their own fate, they had asked people to vote for Congress. \n3) The Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party has been against the decades-long Congress rule in the country, since its inception. It, in fact, formed the foundation that the party was built on. \nAlso watch: \n4) The AAP has been embroiled in too many controversies in the last few years. Whether staged or trapped, the fact of the matter is that the AAP does not have a clean image anymore in the country. Congress’ Captain Amarinder Singh, however, comes on the backdrop of a brilliant electoral campaign and a squeaky clean image. The Capt had repeatedly campaigned against the Badal-government and their corruption and favouritism. Congress should not spoil that image by tying up with a party that had been bad mouthing it since it was born. \n5) This might be Congress’ last chance of saving some face in the country. The grand old party has diminished in its structure since its defeat to the Narendra Modi -led BJP in 2014 and it has been on a downward spiral ever since. The Uttar Pradesh exit polls have also suggested so. So if Congress gets to form a government in the state, it should not take a party like the AAP and share their victory. \nBut of course, the actual poll results are due tomorrow and until then, it would not be wise to form judgements on what party is likely to win what state. But the fact of the matter is, Congress and the AAP are in one of the toughest competitions the state has seen and Congress should keep away from sharing it with the Aam Aadmi Party.
