Full stop,\" said Rachel Tiven, chief executive of Lambda Legal, which defends lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. \nThe federal law in question, known as Title IX, bans sex discrimination in education. But it remains unsettled whether Title IX protections extend to a person's gender identity. The U.S. Supreme Court could settle the issue in a case due to be argued in March . \nThirteen states led by Texas used a states' rights defense in a lawsuit against the Obama administration over its transgender bathroom guidance. That lawsuit would be rendered moot if Trump to were to reverse the Obama policy. \nFollow NBC Out on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .
