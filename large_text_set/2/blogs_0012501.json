The guy who plays Doug Stamper in House of Cards is in it and he looks like he eats nicotine soup for dinner every day. This is how the show portrays the Prince Regent of England: Look, it’s Steve Bannon \n(Tom Hardy still looks pretty good on this show, but there’s nothing anyone can really do about that.) Advertisement Advertisement \nWhy do I appreciate the fact that Taboo has viscerally disgusting characters? Mostly because it reminds me of a very important truth, which is that the past was a fucking nightmare and everything about it sucked. I watch Taboo and I think about the fact that George Washington was a toothless freak who probably smelled like horse piss at all times. I realize that Benjamin Franklin most likely had a dozen venereal diseases and extremely bad skin. I bet Thomas Edison hardly ever wiped and had a butt full of smelly poo most days. \nThese thoughts make me feel better about being alive now and not then, and that’s all anyone can really ask from a TV show in these trying times, you know? I’ll enjoy Taboo while I can, because I’m sure I will change my mind about it after Tom Hardy gets around to fucking his sister. \nAll images via FX", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:14:38.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
