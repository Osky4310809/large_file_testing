One section of the publication that’s directed at “immigration reform” suggests people “call their senators” which is apparently “a quick and effective way to let your voice be heard”.\nIn an effort to fire up existing members and garner new “concerned” recruits, the manual states: If you’re concerned about the status of immigrants and refugees, or maybe you think the travel ban on individuals from seven Muslim-majority nations and the promise to build a wall on our border with Mexico are harmful, discriminatory, and un-American, here’s what you can do. \nBut for now it appears OFA is primarily focusing the brunt of its opposition efforts between now and the 2018 midterms — but make no mistake the relentless group acknowledges it may take “years” if not “decades — of sustained effort” to achieve their goals. \nIn a recent piece published by the New York Post , Paul Sperry explains: The goal is to make Republicans, even from safe districts, second-guess their support for the Trump agenda, and to prime “the ground for the 2018 midterms when Democrats retake power.” \nSperry’s assessment proves the true evolution of OFA and its subtle transformation from Barack Obama’s former campaign into the well-greased political war machine it is today. \nShepard Ambellas is an opinion journalist and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics ( Intellihub.com ).
