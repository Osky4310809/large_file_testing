The official word comes from Lexus International executive vice president Yoshihiro Sawa, who spoke to the Australian publication Motoring at the Geneva auto show last week. The wee UX will slot in below the NX , giving Lexus a more right-sized and right-priced competitor to the likes of the BMW X1 , the Mercedes-Benz GLA-class , and the Audi Q3 . \n-As it stands now, the 182.3-inch-long Lexus NX is a bit larger and more expensive than those diminutive luxo-utes. The 173.2-inch-long UX concept aligns closely size-wise with the Germans and should cost a few thousand dollars less than the NX, which starts at $36,260. The UX concept’s basic dimensions aren’t likely to change much in its transition to production car, but its extreme sci-fi styling may—even if Lexus’s spindle grille sticks around.\n- - Lexus UX Concept: A Preview of the Smallest Lexus SUV - Review: 2017 Lexus NX200t/NX300h - Lexus NX vs. BMW X1, Audi Q3, Infiniti QX30, Mercedes-Benz GLA - -Despite being smaller than the NX, the UX probably will share its powertrains with the larger Lexus SUV. The company already has trademarked UX200, UX250, and UX250h, suggesting a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder as standard and a gasoline-electric hybrid drivetrain as optional. We should find more about the production UX sooner rather than later. As Sawa said, “It’s not so far away.”\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T20:40:30.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
