Bella Hadid did just that by jetting off to Jamaica with a couple of friends and, of course, posting plenty of Instagrams along the way making us wish we were there too. \nThe trip started off in style with the model whisking away her friends to the Caribbean island in a private jet. Then Bella enjoyed what the island had to offer in a beige, barely-there one-piece by Indah, which she paired with orange water shoes. The exact style she wore was the Axel Skimpy One Piece in the color buff. \nCheck out the 'grams for yourself and shop similar styles to Bella's statement-making swimsuit below.
