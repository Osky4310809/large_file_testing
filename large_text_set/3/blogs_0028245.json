(via Twitter/@@khalili26 ) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Saturday, March 25, 2017, 4:18 PM \nOne person was killed and another injured during a bus shooting Saturday outside the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas — leading to standoff with the barricaded shooter on the Strip. \nThe melee began shortly before 11 a.m. local time when shots went off on the bus near the Cosmopolitan and the neighboring Bellagio — where hours earlier a group of burglars tried breaking into a Rolex store. \nDozens of police cars surrounded the double-decker bus, which was wrapped in advertisements. \nTwo blocks of the Las Vegas Strip were shut down, and hotel guests were ordered to stay in their rooms. \nThe suspect was barricaded on the bus, but Las Vegas Metropolitan police said, “There is no active shooter.” The standoff took place outside the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. (George Rose/Getty Images) \nOne victim was brought to University Medical Center of Southern Nevada’s trauma center in an unknown condition, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \nHotel guests along the thoroughfare posted on Twitter that they were ordered to stay inside. \nOne woman — who only identified herself as Anita — said she was walking on a skybridge to the MGM Grand from the Cosmopolitan when she saw the police activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:12:44.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
