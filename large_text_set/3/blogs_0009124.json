The official Girl Scout cookies came from Philadelphia in 1933, and today are manufactured at two facilities in Louisville, Kentucky and Richmond, Virginia. \n\"I love selling Girl Scout cookies because you get to meet new people,\" Nicole Doak, a current Girl Scout in Muskogee, said to NBC News. \nToday there are roughly 2.7 million Girl Scouts: 1.9 million actual scouts and about 800,000 adult members that work primarily as volunteers. \nThe all-time cookie-selling titleholder is 15-year-old Katie Francis of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The high school freshman once sold 22,200 boxes of cookies in a season, roughly three months, which comes out to more than $88,000 worth of cookies. \nFor Francis, she credits her success with keeping a spread sheet detailing previous customers, as well as her ability to work the phones and neighborhoods after school and on weekends. \n\"This year I'm also working towards the career record of 100,100 boxes since it's the 100th anniversary of the cookie sale,\" Francis said. \nWhile the money from the cookie sales is used to fund community projects for the Girl Scouts, there's an added takeaway for the young women who sell them. \n\"I've learned that with a lot of hard work and determination, anybody can achieve anything,\" Francis said. \nFor the Girl Scouts, selling delicious cookies has been a lasting endeavor, serving the community for a century.
