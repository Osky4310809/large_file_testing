Participants were followed for an average of 18.9 years. \nThe researchers note that people who ate hot red chili peppers tended to be “younger, male, white, Mexican-American, married, and to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and consume more vegetables and meats . . . had lower HDL-cholesterol, lower income, and less education,” in comparison to participants who did not consume red chili peppers. \nThough the research is observational, there are some theories why the peppers could help delay death. \nAccording to CBS News, experimental research has suggested that spices and their bioactive ingredient, capsaicin, have anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties. \nThe authors say capsaicin also possesses antimicrobial properties that “may indirectly affect the host by altering the gut microbiota.” \nBut this study doesn’t mean you should rush off to your grocery store. \nPeople with gastrointestinal issues should hold off, experts say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:54:07.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
