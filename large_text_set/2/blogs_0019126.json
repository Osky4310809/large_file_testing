She also apologised to Nigerians and the fans of the two artistes, asking them to see whatever happened while in the house as a game. \nDuring the close to one month that Gifty spent in the house before being evicted, she had said that she didn’t know the artistes. \nHowever, in her apology on Insagram, she said she was rather misconstrued, saying what she meant was that she had never met them in person. Gifty \n“Good evening everyone. First of all I was misunderstood when I said I don’t know Banky, actually what I meant was, ‘I’ve never met him in person.” \n“Banky is an amazing singer no doubt. And right now I want to use this platform to apologise for all the wrong words I said about him. It’s just a game, we say/do things for specific reasons. \n“I was emotional[ly] unstable cos I was up for possible eviction. So to all Banky fans and everyone plz forgive me, Banky I love ur music and you are a talented cute guy. \n“And concerning Falz, I know the song called “soft work” but believe me I had no idea it was FALZ that sang it and also I haven’t met him before..that was why I had to ask ‘who is he’. \n“To everyone out there, I just want to refresh your mindset again that the BIG BROTHER SHOW is always a game that has just one winner and whatever actions u have seen in the house is for a reason so please I beg you all don’t judge by what you have seen or heard,” she concluded.
