It was a totally different world that you lived in and even today when you talk about your school, non-all-girls school goers look at you with total disbelief. If you ever went to a Convent or an all-girls high school, we bet you'll totally relate to these things now. 1. Mean Girls is your favourite movie not just because it's fun, but because it was real life for you. 2. Talking about your period in a roomful of people isn't a big deal. You literally have to stop yourself from screaming across the work desk for a tampon. 3. You realised early on that while female friendships were a lot more dramatic, they were also a lot more rewarding. Nothing beats have a girl's shoulder to cry on in times of trouble. 4. Even today when people make generic assumptions about how women can never be friends, you get angry. Some of your best friends are from school, and yes they are all women. 5. Everyone who says that women dress up to impress boys don't know what they are talking about. There wasn't one boy worth impressing around us back then. For the last time, we dress for ourselves! 6. Biology lessons were a breeze. Maybe that's why you are still so chill while talking about sex, or your vajayjay ... it's no big deal! 7. Changing clothes in front of the roommate ... NBD! You are totally cool with your body. 8. You tend to be a bit too TMI-ey in front of people you've met for the first time. There was nothing like Too Much Information in a girls' school, everything could be discussed ... a habit you are having a hard time letting go of. 9. The moment you meet another all-girls school kid you are over the moon, Finally someone who doesn't think standing in front of the boss with your hands behind your back is weird. 10. You still use \"I am on my period\" as an excuse to get out of things you don't like to do. It worked perfectly during those Physical Training classes. 11. Not having a friend to \"check your skirts for period stains\" is kind of a pain. Now you have to twist your neck while checking your behind for possible stains at work. 12. Despite popular notions, you can get ready in five minutes flat. All those years of rushing to the loo when the final bell rang, putting on your mascara and getting out of school with your skirt rolled slightly higher than the standard approved, has trained you. 13. Adjusting the twins in front of everyone, or pulling your jeans a little higher in public is totally acceptable. Hey, if boys can scratch their you-know-what, why can't you do this? 14. You probably will never have a fight with another girl over a boy. You were in convent school and 75 girls collectively having a crush on one male teacher is pretty normal behaviour for you. 15. Ever today, you don't understand the concept of quietly crying in the loo. Sitting with your gang of girls, right in the middle of the playground, sobbing your heart out and getting such good advice ... that's how you function. 16. Drama ... you thrived on it in school. Anything anyone does, you can totally deal with it like a boss. 17. You will never underestimate another woman. You know how hard they can punch, and how well they can play those mind games. 18. Linking arms with your BFF, giving a warm hug to a colleague, kissing an old friend on the cheeks ... these displays of affection come normally to you. \n19. You are totally okay with same sex relationships. Heck you spent half your life calling some girl or the other a lesbian (despite what her sexual orientation really way). And no, even then you never found it gross ... just kind of interesting. \n20. No one can even come close to being as good friends as your gang of girls in school.
