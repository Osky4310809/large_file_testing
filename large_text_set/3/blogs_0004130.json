Most also believe that the press has assumed the role of the opposition party. \nThe poll also showed the public backs Trump’s ‘Hire American’ immigration policies; \nThe poll found that 57% back Trump’s plan to hire 10,000 more immigration agents; 58% support the deportation of illegal immigrations charged with a crime, even if they haven’t been convicted; 53% back Trump’s call to withhold federal aid to “sanctuary cities.” \nAmid media hostility, Trump’s Feb. 28 successful speech to the joint session of Congress also boosted his support, according to the poll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:44:58.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
