Why should they stop it? Are they not part of us? Do they have special markets? If they want to be overzealous with their job, then we will tell them that we are not joking.” \nSimilarly, the UAD leader and human rights activist, Ebun-Olu Adegoruwa, pointed out that Nigerians do not require police advice to exercise their fundamental rights. \nHe added, “I have read in several news reports, of the statement credited to the Nigeria Police Force, advising that the mass rally against suffering and hunger in Nigeria, slated for Monday should be cancelled, purportedly in the interest of peace and security. The police have no power in law to countermand the lawful directives of the acting President (Yemi Osinbajo), which affirmed our constitutional right to assemble together freely, unhindered and unmolested, for a peaceful protest. \n“So, it is disturbing, alarming and anachronistic, for an institution, such as the police, that was set up to be under the executive, headed by the president or the acting president, to be defying the lawful directives of the acting president, openly and with such brazen impunity.” \nThe activist vowed that the rally would be held and many more would still be organised. He urged Nigerians to join the Monday protest. \n“The people of Nigeria shall hold this (Monday protest) and many more rallies, in the days ahead, until Nigeria is totally rid of bad governance,” Adegboruwa said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:23:08.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
