We do not care about your presidency. We want the ability to determine our future without taking permission from Abuja. Simple – now is it hard to understand? I belong to your constituency – maybe you should consult us before speaking that way.. impossible \nWho will zone iti evil children of biafra. We know What will happen if an evil child if satan full blooded Biafran ever holds real power. The mass murder of Other tribes’ leaders by evil nzeogwu and d mass Murder by evil ojukwu will forever be remembered So how’s it possible for true nga to allow an evil Child if satan full blooded biafran to get there. U Are not nigerians and never will be ; u are all Tolerated squaters in nga. igboham \nI guess we agree. We do not want your presidency and you do not wish to give it to us either. No problem. God night. Synario \nTake your presidency. Your son have ruled for 11yrs, 3ys as Military and 8yrs as civilian which I know you region is not better off. Do you have portable water supply more than other region, Do you have uninterrupted power supply and good road network more than other region,more developed, more educated or richer than other region. If the listed question in no, then why worry about where the presidency comes from. Are the Ijaws where JEG comes from now going on the moon. What about the North that have ruled for 32 yrs, are they better off, No beggars on the street again in their region or are they better educated than other region. \nTake your presidency and stop abusing a tribe you don’t know their destinies. Leave them a lone and think about your own problem .we don’t need it. what we need is Good Governance and good economic environment and leave the rest for a hard working Ibo man we can sort out ourselves. Thank you for the abuse for no justifiable reasons. Punch you allow this post to go through but if it is the other way round, you delete This is not fair. 9jaPolitrickz \nSouth East should prepare because come 2019, Whether born to rule mentality zone likes it or not, the mantle of leadership will fall on them. Coco B \nSenator Chukwumeri,it will b impossible for igbo to produce d president of this country becos by d time u announce to for them to produce a president with their pull him dowm(phd)syndrown,they will so destroyed themselves until outsiders take it away from them and they will forever sing biafra song that has no head,igbo are not good to lead but to betray Goodluck \nThe idea of rotational preidency among the zones is fraudulent, l will expect an intelligent national assembly to beging to look into our laws and practices with a view to removing undemocratic practices. There is nothing as good as having a system where those who wants to be president presents themselves for screening by the various agencies of the state before going to the primaries. If a person wins the primaries through a free, fair and transparent process, so be it. This idea of rotating the presidency has set us backward as a nation, and that is why poverty and unemployment is very high in Nigeria. If rotation is the only basis for ensuring that no region is marginalized, then it is time we adopt a lose federation. What we want is economic development and not an ethnic president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T04:24:34.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
