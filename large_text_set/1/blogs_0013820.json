Oscar played with us, he had a good offer from China and he went. \n“But I don’t see a threat for my players because I think we are a big club and it is a great honour to play for Chelsea. I don’t see a threat for my players. \n“I understand, but the money is not all. When you play for a good team like Chelsea, you must be pleased. \n“The Premier League is really competitive and every player wants to come and play in this league. This league is the first in the world because of a lot of positive things. For this reason, I don’t think these offers are a threat for our league.” Costa has had his head turned by lucrative offers from China (Photo: PA) \nChelsea plan clear-the-air talks with Costa as the first team will return to training on Tuesday and Conte still believes that the bad boy striker can return to the squad this week. \nCosta has been urged to apologise by his team mates who have pleaded with him to stay but the Brazilian-born striker has had his head turned and made no secret he wanted to leave England last summer. \nThat appeared to have been solved after Chelsea’s brilliant start to the campaign until the flare-up with Costa who insists he has a back problem and was angry that fitness coach Julio Tous wanted him to train. The striker has claimed he is injured (Photo: Chelsea Football Club) \nBut the underlying issue is that Chelsea fear that Costa’s agent Jorge Mendes - pictured meeting Tianjin Quanjian chairman Shu Yuhui after the bust-up story broke on Friday - has deliberately undermined their title campaign. \nSuper agent Mendes also represents Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho and knows that the Costa move to China would be the biggest - when fee and wages are added together - in football history. \nThat has enraged Chelsea who fear an agent war between Mendes and Kia Joorabchian is at the heart of the Costa unrest as agents battle for the best deals in China.
