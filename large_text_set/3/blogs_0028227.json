(That would be a new thing for government workers all by itself.) \n“It worked beautifully to transform state government because people knew they had to get to work, even if they had a little sniffle,” Tanner added. \n“A lot of people will say, ‘You have to protect the civil servants,’” he said. “Who gets cut out of the picture when you protect the civil servant? The average citizen dealing with a bunch of bureaucrats.” \nHe couldn’t be more right about that.
