Nicolas Flamel shared the Philosopher's Stone with Perenelle, making them both immortal until the Stone was destroyed in 1992 . They both died sometime after this point. Albus Dumbledore Edit \nAlbus Dumbledore was a close friend to Nicolas. Albus was the one who gave the advice to Nicolas Flamel to put the Stone in Gringotts Wizarding Bank in 1991 . It was also Albus who moved the stone to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for further protection later the same year ( 1991 ). Etymology Edit Nicolas is the French form of the Greek name Nikolaos, meaning \"victory of the people\". The name Flamel means in Old French \"flame\". Such meaning can be associated to Flamel's work as an alchemist. Behind the scenes In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , Flamel's first name is spelt as Nicholas, adding an h in the subtitles and the book Hermione Granger reads. Also in the film, Harry Potter , Ron Weasley , and Hermione Granger discover the link to Nicolas Flamel and the stone through a book, rather than Albus Dumbledore 's Chocolate Frog Card . (In a deleted scene you see them discovering the connection through a chocolate frog card, but it was switched when edited). Nicolas Flamel was a real French Alchemist believed in legend to have created the Philosopher's Stone. He was born about 1330 and died in 1418 . There is no proof that he achieved immortality with his wife Perenelle, but a few have claimed to have seen him throughout the centuries. Some treasure-hunters accidentally dug up his grave and discovered that his tomb was empty. Another goal of Nicolas Flamel was to turn ordinary lead into pure gold. The reference to Flamel marks one of the few occasions in which a real person has been referenced as a character in the Potter books. Nicolas Flamel is the title of chapter 13 in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone . In a deleted first draft of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , Hermione revealed that Nicholas Flamel was spotted in an opera house which was located in Paris in 1762 . [6] Before Horace Slughorn was introduced, there were rumours that Flamel would come to Hogwarts to teach Potions. On an old version of her Website, J. K. Rowling made clear that this rumours were false, and that Flamel had already died. [7] Author's comments Edit \nJ. K. Rowling admitted that several months into the writing of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone she had a highly detailed and exceptionally vivid dream about Flamel, which was like \" a renaissance painting come to life \". Flamel was leading her around his cluttered laboratory, which was bathed in golden light, and showing exactly how to make the Stone.
