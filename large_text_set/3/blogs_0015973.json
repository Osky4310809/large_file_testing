Her makeup line, Huda Beauty, which she introduced in 2013 with a false lashes collection, successfully expanded last year with the addition of hit lip liners, liquid matte lipsticks and an eye shadow palette. Photo Huda Beauty, introduced in 2013 with a false-lashes collection, successfully expanded last year. Sephora, for one, was surprised at how well her lip liners (called Lip Contours because Ms. Kattan uses them to make her lips look bigger, she said) sold. As a category, lip liners are often an afterthought because they were created to support lipsticks. Yet Ms. Kattan’s Lip Contour release last May was “one of the biggest launches in years,” said Artemis Patrick, the senior vice president for merchandising at the retailer. Certainly Sephora is no stranger to makeup lines driven by social media. Anastasia Beverly Hills, Kat Von D and Natasha Denona all wield social media might. But Ms. Kattan is unique for a global reach that spans the United States, the Middle East and beyond. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “It’s rare for one person to be relatable across so many countries and cultures,” Ms. Patrick said. “Obviously, it’s the power of the internet, but it’s a testament to her business acumen that she can translate and harness the power of her followers.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, Huda Beauty continues to be a top makeup brand at Sephora Middle East. And at Harrods in London, there have been lines for Huda Beauty ever since the company set up a counter in August. It’s “one of our fastest growing color makeup brands,” said Annalise Fard, the beauty and home director at the store. Relatable and sometimes giggly, Ms. Kattan is not in the makeup game to make a quick buck. “We’ve had really big brands approach us because they’re interested in investing,” she said. “But we own this, and I’m building a brand.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Though social media fame can seem immediate, it didn’t come overnight for Ms. Kattan. An Iraqi-American who was raised in Cookeville, Tenn., and Boston, she was, like many teenagers, obsessed with beauty products. “We didn’t grow up superwealthy,” Ms. Kattan said, noting that her father was an engineering professor, while her mother stayed home to raise her and four siblings. “D.I.Y. was supercool because it was affordable and you could do it really easily.” (Ms. Kattan is known for some of her zanier D.I.Y. experiments on YouTube, including trying alternative makeup primers — in one video, she found Vagisil superior to KY Jelly and Milk of Magnesia. “I honestly thought the lube was going to be the best primer, but it didn’t work at all,” she said, laughing. “People in the Middle East did not necessarily like it. Ha! Sometimes I get a little chastised.”) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story As for her renowned brow-defining skills, they were cultivated early. “I’m hairy,” she said girlishly. “If you’re hairy, you have to figure out how to do them at a young age.” Her lighthearted approach to beauty later translated to a WordPress blog she started in 2010 at her sister Mona’s urging. Ms. Kattan had taken a makeup course in California and was hoping to build a makeup clientele in Dubai, where she moved after her father took a job teaching at the American University of Sharjah.
