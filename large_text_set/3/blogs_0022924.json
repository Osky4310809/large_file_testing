But here are some things you could do -- You can write your own poetry; You can read poems that you like; You can recite poems; You can ask others to read their favorite poems to you. \nThis day is an initiative of Unesco when people across the world appreciate poetry and poets. \nPoetry is considered to be an emotion and it is said that everyone has a poem that has touched their lives. Here is a compilation of quotes on poetry by famous poets that might help you celebrate this day. \n1. Robert Frost - \"A poem begins as a lump in the throat, a sense of wrong, a homesickness, a lovesickness.\" \n2. William Wordsworth - \"Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.\" \n3. Alice Walker Read - \"Poetry is the lifeblood of rebellion, revolution, and the raising of consciousness.\" \n4. Ezra Pound - \"Use no superfluous word, no adjective, which does not reveal something. Don’t use such an expression as 'dim land of peace.' It dulls the image. It mixes an abstraction with the concrete. It comes from the writer’s not realizing that the natural object is always the adequate symbol. Go in fear of abstractions.\" \nA handwritten manuscript by Scottish poet Robert Burns entitled \"The Death and Dying Words of Poor Maillie\" was displayed at the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock, Scotland, March 25, 2014.

Carol Anne Duffy - \"You can find poetry in your everyday life, your memory, in what people say on the bus, in the news, or just what’s in your heart.\" \n7. Erica Jong - \"What makes you a poet is a gift for language, an ability to see into the heart of things, and an ability to deal with important unconscious material. When all these things come together, you’re a poet. But there isn’t one little gimmick that makes you a poet. There isn’t any formula for it.\" \n8. W.H. Auden - \"A poet must never make a statement simply because it is sounds poetically exciting; he must also believe it to be true.\" \n9. Percy Bysshe Shelley - \"Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar.\" \n10. Henry David Thoreau - \"Poetry is the only life got, the only work done, the only pure product and free labor of man, performed only when he has put all the world under his feet, and conquered the last of his foes.\" Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:11:30.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
