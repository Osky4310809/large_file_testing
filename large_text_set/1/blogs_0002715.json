Not their titles. \n“It’s about being in Europe and over the next decade to be there [in the Champions League] every year. That’s more important to this club than winning one title, believe me, more than that. \n“We have to convince people at this amazing club that they are good. They are good. And the fans as well. \n\"They have to believe they are good, the club is good, the players are good.” \nCity have taken part in the Champions League over the last six seasons including 2016-17, though they are still yet to get their hands on the coveted trophy. \nGuardiola's charges take on Monaco over two legs in the last 16 of this year's tournament, with the ties set to take place in February and March respectively.
