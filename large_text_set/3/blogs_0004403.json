Seriously, Justin Timberlake’s loving words to Jessica Biel on her birthday are worthy of being in a song. On Friday, Biel celebrated her 35th birthday, and of course her amazing husband was ready to gush over her. The Trolls actor took to social media to share the sweetest message to his love. \nWarning: these words might make you fall in love with the singer even more. We know that wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world, but remember he is taken.\n“You make me laugh. You make me smile. You make me LOVE. You make me want to be BETTER,” Timberlake wrote on Instagram. You make me laugh. You make me smile. You make me LOVE. You make me want to be BETTER. Speaking of, it doesn't get any BETTER than you... Now, I know for sure that it's BETTER to be lucky than good. Ask me who the luckiest guy in the world is and I will tell you that you are looking at him. Happy Birthday, my heart. --J \nA post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on Mar 3, 2017 at 4:21pm PST \n“Speaking of, it doesn’t get any BETTER than you…” he continued. “Now, I know for sure that it’s BETTER to be lucky than good. Ask me who the luckiest guy in the world is and I will tell you that you are looking at him.” “Happy Birthday, my heart. — J,” the “Can’t Stop the Feeling” singer concluded.\n“It’s better to be lucky than good” is our new motto for love. Yes, you can now say “awww” because this is such a precious message. While the former NSYNC singer has never been shy about how much he loves Biel, this post just takes the cake.\nThis isn’t the first time however that these two have stolen our hearts . Last week the duo was one of the hottest couples at the Oscars.\nThey laughed, photobombed and of course, posted a hilarious snap at the end of the night. Post Oscars. Pre party. Baby daddy duty. \nA post shared by Jessica Biel (@jessicabiel) on Feb 26, 2017 at 10:55pm PST \nThere was also the time the happy couple played scrabble. It’s the ultimate date night, don’t you think?\nI played 'sardine' and got the 50 bonus points! Guess who is no longer undefeated... #scrabblebrag \nA post shared by Jessica Biel (@jessicabiel) on Oct 13, 2016 at 2:54pm PDT \nLast year Timberlake proved once again that he is the ultimate husband. His message was so sweet back then , and let’s face it we wish he’d just start singing these messages.\nHappy BAE-DAY, baby!! I can't put into words what you mean to me... You are the GREATEST Mommy and Wife a man could ever ask for. I love you to the MOON AND BACK!!! --Your Huz \nA post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on Mar 3, 2016 at 8:21pm PST \nReally, what’s not to love about these two?
