Reap the benefits of cashback websites (Photo: Getty) \nEarn as you spend as well as collecting freebies, by signing up to a free cashback site like - Topcashback or Quidco . \nTopcashback states that their members earn an average of £325 a year - that's an extra £325 you can put back into your pocket. \nHow does it work? Basically, when you buy something online, cashback sites will give you a percentage of that spend back. For example, if you spend £10 on a pack of nappies at Boots and there is 10% cashback, you'll get £1 back. \nInstead of shopping directly through a store online, you access the retailer through a cashback website - like Topcashback or Quidco - who will then get paid (by the brand) for 'referring' you to them. \nYour transaction will continue as normal and your item will still arrive directly from the retailer, but the cashback website will pay you a cut of this payment as a reward for using its services and as an incentive to encourage you to return. How to find the cheapest nappies Whatever your approach, you'll need hundreds of nappies - here's the cheapest places to buy them \nNo matter how much you try to avoid it - you will go through huge amounts of nappies. Stock up on as many free samples as you can, as soon as you find out, such as these free Aldi Mamia nappies and wipes from Net Mums . \nWhen you download the Bounty app you'll also get baby freebies such as vouchers and samples. If you collect yours from Tesco stores you'll get the bumper Bounty mum-to-be pack, which also includes a 25 pack of nappies and a packet of wipes. \nThe BumDeal App lets you find the cheapest nappy in the size and brand you need. \nIt's also worth signing up to every major brand's newsletters to stay up-to-date with their latest offers.

Just put them through the washing machine before you use them and they'll be good as new. \nWhile we strongly recommend never buying a second hand car seat (it may have been weakened over time), you can also get rigorously tested items off the auction site on high street shops' official eBay clearance sections, which include all the usual safety and money-back guarantees - at a significantly cheaper price. \nFor example, Argos' eBay clearance store sells a selection of cheap push chairs , stair gates , car sears , high chairs and baby monitors .
