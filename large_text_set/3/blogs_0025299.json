By Scott Mervis / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nRobert Christgau is known for being something of a crank. So when his first words are that he has a cold and is going without coffee (not sure why), I figure we’re in trouble. \nTwo minutes later, he bristles at a question about his start in journalism, saying, “Scott, you know, this is in my book. Understand?” \nThis interview is wasting valuable record-reviewing time, and, in fact, he’s listening to one as talks on the phone from his home in New York. Because that’s what Robert Christgau does. Since he started covering music in the late ‘60s, the 74-year-old self-proclaimed “dean of rock critics” has reviewed more than 14,000 albums. \nBefore doing his renowned work at Esquire, the Village Voice, Blender and Rolling Stone, the Greenwich Village native and Dartmouth grad, who speaks at the Pittsburgh Humanities Festival on Sunday, was a news reporter at the Newark Star-Ledger, trying to incorporate influences of Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese. \n“My idea about journalism was that I wanted to be a New Journalist, a literary journalist. I wanted to write. I didn’t have the imagination for fiction, so I wanted to write profiles and that sort of thing. I never was terribly good at that,” he says. \nHowever, his story for New York magazine about a woman who died on a macrobiotic diet gave him a good clip, and then one thing led another (it’s all in the book!), and in early 1967, he was invited to take over the “Pop Eye” column at Esquire. Rock criticism was still new. Daily newspapers did a lame job of it, so the action was building publications like Melody Maker and Crawdaddy in ‘66, and then Rolling Stone in late ‘67. \nThe Esquire stint lasted two years. \n“The editor of Esquire, who was an old jazzbo, basically, thought ‘What are we doing this for?’ and fired me. He probably didn’t like my attitude either. Esquire was still pretty buttoned-down in the late ‘60s, and I was not. I looked like a hippie, even though I wasn’t one.” \nBounced from Esquire, he replaced Richard Goldstein as music editor at the Voice —“It was too much for him; it wasn’t as deep in him as it was for me”— where he pioneered a consumer approach to review writing aptly called the Consumer Guide. \n“I did it for two or three reasons. The most important was that I was hearing more music than I had any room to write about. And also because I knew it would [anger] my friends on the left. This was an anti-consumerist moment and,” he says, referring of his then-girlfriend and famed culture writer Ellen Willis, “we were not anti-consumers. We were radicals but we weren’t anti-consumerists, and Willis wrote a great piece in which she made that argument. She had a lot of effect on me.” \n“The early Consumer Guides weren’t much,” he says. “I didn’t work on them hard enough.” But as the ‘70s went on, he was prodded by his wife, author Carola Dibbell (to whom he is still married), to make them better. With his searing wit and dense, often esoteric, style, the dean was able to “make” a record or dispense with it in three sharp sentences, with a tacked-on letter grade that irritated Lou Reed to no end. In his famous rant on the 1978 live album “Take No Prisoners,” the rock legend took on the critic with “Can you imagine working for a [expletive] year, and you get a B+ from some [expletive] in the Village Voice?” \nA few years later, in 1983, Sonic Youth called him out on the song “Kill Yr Idols” (later renamed “I Killed Christgau With My [something unprintable]”), prompting him to dismiss them as “impotent bohos.” \nSomehow, none of that fazed him. He and Sonic Youth warmed to each other over the years, but Mr. Reed? “I had an encounter with him and he treated me like [crap], and that was after I nominated him for a MacArthur. He didn’t know that. Definitely, I rubbed him the wrong way. What can I say?” \nAlong with the Consumer Guide, he launched the Pazz and Jop Poll, a survey of the nation’s critics that has been a Voice signature since 1971. That said, he’s not a fan of best-of lists. \n“When magazines do those Top 50 albums list, they’re not doing them by what is best, they’re trying to create a piece of copy that identifies their brand.” \nHe’s pretty sure that goes for individual critics, as well. \n“As someone who’s looked at tens of thousands of Top 10s, I think a lot of people do the same thing: They’re establishing their brand, they’re touching all the bases. They have not listened back as much as they should, and they’re telling you what they should like rather than what they do like, which I always tell critics is the cardinal sin.” \nIn 2006, amidst the purge by new owners New Times Media, Mr. Christgau was fired by the Voice, then hired as a contributing editor for Rolling Stone, despite the fact that he and Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner “disliked each other intensely.” \n“I think one reason Joe [Levy] got away with hiring me there, I think Jann wanted to own me for a year,” he says. “It was understood that I had my own way of doing things and, of course, there would be adjustments, and Jann, he still goes in and changes people’s grades. I stopped writing freelance reviews in the early aughts because of precisely that kind of thing.” \nBlender hired him in 2007 and went under in 2008. Since then, his consumer guide, retitled Expert Witness, has bounced from MSN to Noisey, and along with being an adjunct professor at New York University, in 2015 he published the aforementioned memoir “Going into the City: Portrait of a Critic as a Young Man.” \nNow, he’s the portrait of an older man who has outlasted contemporaries who were younger than him but either lost interest or got burnt out. \n“My observation as an editor is that it hits people in their late 30s/early 40s and if you get over that hump, usually, then you’re in it. Yes, there is certainly the possibility of turning into a hack having gone over that hump and just phoning it in, but, as I like to say, I don’t bore easily. I find the world an infinitely interesting place.” \nThat’s put him on an insatiable hunt for good music —“I play music essentially all the time”— and he insists that more good stuff is being made now than ever before. His logic? “When I began doing this, what was the population of the United States? 175 million? Now it’s around 320, so...” \nPunk and Senegalese music are his personal sweet spots, but he buys a lot of the hip-hop records, while thinking the mixtape culture dilutes the quality. Asked where the vitality is in music right now, he quickly says, “female country artists.” Not male. “I don’t know of a male country singer that is any good, and that includes Sturgill Simpson and Chris Stapleton.” \nWith so much time spent on new music, he regrets that there is little chance to revisit the classics or old favorites. \n“There are albums that I have given A-’s and even A’s that I will die without ever hearing again. That’s a simple function of how many hours there are in a day and how much longer I have to live.” \nScott Mervis: smervis@post-gazette.com. \nRobert Christgau will appear at the Harris Theater, 809 Liberty Ave., Downtown, as part of the Pittsburgh Humanities Festival at 3 p.m. Sunday.
