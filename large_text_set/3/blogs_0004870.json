Janusz Michallik says that although Man City didn't overpower Sunderland, Sergio Aguero & Co. took their opportunities. \nIt should be the age of great strikers in the Premier League. The firepower available to English football's best teams is arguably as impressive as at any time in the division's modern era. Yet of the top five in the table, only Harry Kane at Tottenham Hotspur has not spent part of the season at loggerheads with his manager. \nDiego Costa has rowed with Antonio Conte at Chelsea. Daniel Sturridge is down the pecking order at Liverpool and has sometimes slipped to third-choice forward under Jurgen Klopp. Alexis Sanchez is under a cloud at Arsenal, even though Arsene Wenger has played down behind-the-scenes friction at the Emirates. The most perplexing case, however, is Sergio Aguero at Manchester City. \nThe Argentinian fell out of favour at the Etihad and was dropped after the January arrival of Gabriel Jesus. Aguero returned to the team only when the newcomer suffered a broken metatarsal, and since his return, Aguero has scored five times in four games. Yet there are persistent suggestions that the 28-year-old does not suit Pep Guardiola's style of play, and it would be no surprise if the striker moved away from City in the summer transfer window. \nBoth player and manager are making soothing noises (especially after Aguero scored twice in his side's 2-0 victory over Sunderland), but questions about the pair's relationship remain. \nOn the face of it, Guardiola's dissatisfaction with his star striker is based on Aguero's work rate. City's style of pressing relies on the front man chasing down defenders as they push the ball across the back line. It also demands that the striker closes down the defence until the ball is played into midfield, which can mean the forward scurrying after as many as three defensive players in succession. In the early part of the season, Guardiola was frustrated that Aguero would make a huge effort to press the first man, pay lip service to close down the second defender and completely ignore his duties in charging after the third ball-carrier. \nCity's style of play, often operating with only two dedicated midfielders, means a huge responsibility is placed on the front four to press the opposition high up the pitch. Aguero, David Silva, Raheem Sterling, Leroy Sane and Kevin De Bruyne are all players whose natural games are based on attacking, but in Guardiola's system, they are required to do some defensive work. \nAs the team's main forward, Aguero might have expected to be spared some of the running that Guardiola's press demands and retain his energy for when goal scoring opportunities occur. When the Catalan is able to put together a more balanced midfield, he might require his main striker to put in less effort in the press. But for the moment, the Argentinian has to accede to his manager's wishes. \nAguero has made a huge effort to comply with Guardiola's needs. Against Sunderland, he ran more than he had all season, covering 10.5 km, according to Premier League tracking data. He made the largest number of sprints for the campaign (81), but many of those were to apply pressure on defenders. It is arguable whether this is the best use of the striker's talents. \nThis might not matter when City are winning, as Guardiola's methods are vindicated by success. But there are deeper concerns for the manager that mean Aguero must bend to the Catalan's will. Aguero, right, hasn't had the easiest time under Guardiola. Will he be a Man City player next season? \nBefore Christmas, especially following defeats by Chelsea and Leicester City, Guardiola felt that his team was not taking his instructions on board. The squad were not listening to their manager, a situation that could not be allowed to continue. If Aguero, the team's biggest star, were allowed to do his own thing, it would send the wrong message to the rest of the squad. Guardiola showed his ruthlessness in sending Joe Hart out on loan to Torino at the beginning of the season, and the 46-year-old has no compunction about showing players who's boss. \nYounger players are easier to manage. They generally take instruction more easily and are less likely to challenge the man in charge. Senior players can have a \"seen-it-all-before\" air about them and are liable to question the manager's decisions. Some coaches consider this disruptive; it's important to City that Aguero, a battle-hardened and seasoned veteran, fall into line. \nGuardiola has since been delighted with Aguero's efforts, calling them \"really brilliant\" after the game at the Stadium of Light. In many ways, the handling of City's best striker has been a masterpiece of management and motivation. Aguero is working harder and scoring goals at an impressive rate (23 in all competitions), thus providing an example to the rest of the team about subverting his own game for the manager's wishes. \nEven so, it would be no surprise if the initial rift between Aguero and Guardiola were wide enough to lead the player to look elsewhere in the summer. He will be 29 in June and might want to save his legs as he heads toward the latter stages of his career. Once, a manager would have built his team around Aguero. At City, the striker has to adapt to suit his boss. \nAguero might not be the only one whose face does not fit in the summer, either. Sanchez could leave the Emirates, Costa's future is still in question, and it would be a shock if Sturridge is still at Anfield next season. In the top five, only Kane is happy and settled. \nThe golden age of front men has lost a little lustre for some of the Premier League's best forwards, but Aguero is rising to the challenge -- at least for now. \nTony Evans has been a sports journalist for more than 20 years.
