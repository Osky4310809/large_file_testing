J.J. Udoedeghe of allegedly committing series of anti-party offences (copy attached as annexture C); \n“And whereas the State Executive Committee from the time of receipt of the said letter and the evidence attacked thereto, up until the time of taking this decision, has not received any letter of appeal from the accused, Sen. John James Akpanudoedeghe, contradicting the allegations made against him; \n“We wish to state that we are convinced based on evidence before us and the concomitant conducts of the accused (Sen. J.J. Udoedeghe), some of which are, but not limited to: \n“Sponsorship of thugs and disgruntled elements on 18th January, 2017, to attack, harass, intimidate and cause grievous bodily harm on staff and executive members of the party at the State Secretariat located on No. 4 Atiku Abubarkar Avenue, Uyo, in contravention of Article 21 A (vii) of the Party’s Constitution; \n“Past and most recent unauthorized publications (copies attached as annexture D) with intention to malign, ridicule, and further cause confusion and disunity within the party, thereby contravening Article 21 A (v) of the party’s constitution, etc; \n“Consequently, Sen. John James Akpanudoedeghe, who until this decision was a member of the State Caucus of the APC, is hereby expelled forthwith from the party in line with Article 13.7 (vi). \n“In transmitting to you, Mr Zonal/ National Chairman and the Zonal Executive Committee of our great party our unanimous resolution and decision, the State Executive Committee wishes to draw your attention to our earlier letters dated 1st September, 2015 in respect to the expelled Sen.
