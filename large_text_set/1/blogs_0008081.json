He was supportive of Mr. Trump’s campaign and often appeared on business news shows to explain Mr. Trump’s positions. \nWorth an estimated $2.9 billion, Ross built his fortune by buying and restructuring distressed industrial businesses, such as steelmaker LTV. Ross might be best known to voters as the owner of Sago Mine, a West Virginia coal mine where a dozen miners lost their lives in a 2006 explosion. \nRoss will certainly get questions about his position on trade deals, since the Trump transition team has indicated that Mr. Trump will put Ross in charge of trade policy. Like Mr. Trump (and unlike most of the Republican Party), Ross favors withdrawing from or renegotiating free trade agreements. \nBEN CARSON (Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) \nCarson, who has never held elected office, is a former 2016 hopeful who dropped out of the race last March and endorsed Mr. Trump shortly thereafter. He’ll appear at a hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. \nThe 65-year-old neurosurgeon, who has no previous policy experience in the field of urban development, speculated to Fox News before Thanksgiving that his upbringing was the reason Mr. Trump was interested in nominating him to the position. \n“I grew up in the inner city and have spent a lot of time there, and have dealt with a lot of patients from that area and recognize that we cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner cities,” he said. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
