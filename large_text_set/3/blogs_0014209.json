Last fall, the New York Times reported that Trump reported a massive $916 million loss in 1995, which enabled him to avoid paying income taxes for decades.\nThe records have become highly sought-after because Trump refused to release his returns during the campaign, breaking a decades-long tradition. He claimed he was under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and said his attorneys had advised against it – though experts and IRS officials said such audits don’t bar taxpayers from releasing their returns.\nThe White House pushed back pre-emptively Tuesday night, saying that publishing those returns would be illegal.\n“You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,” the statement said. It added that Trump, as “one of the most successful businessmen in the world,” paid “no more tax than legally required.”\nRelated A guide to Donald Trump ’s complex, opaque business ties around the world Jack Mintz: How the New York Times got it wrong on Donald Trump’s tax returns The most shocking part of Donald Trump ’s tax records isn’t the $916 million loss everyone’s talking about The statement went on to say: “Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.”\nThe unauthorized release or publishing of federal tax returns is a criminal offence, punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and up to five years in jail. But Maddow argued that MSNBC was exercising its First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest.\nBased on the documents obtained by Johnston, Trump paid $36.5 million in taxes on $153 million in income, for an effective tax rate of around 24 per cent. That percentage is higher than the roughly 10 per cent the average American pays each year — but below the 27.4 per cent that taxpayers earning 1 million dollars a year average, according to data from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\nTrump long insisted the American public wasn’t interested in his returns and said little could be learned from them. But Trump’s full returns would contain key details about things like his charitable giving and how much he made each year.\nThe issue a major point of attack from his rival Hillary Clinton, who suggested Trump had something to hide.\nThe White House has not said whether or not the president plans to release his returns while he’s in office. More than 1 million people have signed a White House petition urging the president to release them.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T04:26:52.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
