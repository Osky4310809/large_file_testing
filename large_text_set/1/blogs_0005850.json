Pricing starts at $25 for 20 hours of play on a GTX 1060 PC, or 10 hours of play on a GTX 1080 PC. A free trial will also be available.\nInterestingly, the new service works like a virtual desktop, with users seeing a full Windows install on logging in. From there, users can load up regular versions of Steam, Battle.net, Origin, Uplay and GOG and download any game they like from their existing library.\nFree-to-play games like World of Tanks will also work with the service. Users just have to download the GeForce Now app to their local machine, which then connects to one of Nvidia's virtual PCs.\nGames played on GeForce work with each service's cloud save functionality, allowing users to pick up where they left off on any readily accessible computer.\nNvidia is pitching the new and improved GeForce now service at integrated graphics users, laptop users, and Mac users that would otherwise be unable to play demanding games. The previous version of GeForce Now was limited to use on Nvidia devices like the Shield Tablet , Shield Android TV , and graphics cards.\nEarly access to the new GeForce Now service is scheduled for March in the US, with a full service slated for the spring. Interested users can sign up now for early access . Availability for the rest of the world has not yet been announced.\nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T06:35:16.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
