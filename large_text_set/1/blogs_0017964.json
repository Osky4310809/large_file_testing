And he wasn’t pleased. \nWhen asked why McCormack missed training, and was subsequently dropped, Bruce snapped: “His gates were stuck.” \nAccording to The Mirror, Bruce was so angry he even took the drastic steps to drive to McCormack’s place, and photographed the fence - just 4ft 6in - to prove he could have actually left the property. \nAlthough Bruce has supported McCormack until now, despite missing training twice for being sick, this excuse infuriated him, sparking this almighty press conference rant. \n“In my opinion he is not fit enough to play and he will not play unless his attitude towards training and missing training improves,” he said after Aston Villa’s 2-2 draw with Preston \n“If that improves then I will reconsider him but if he continues to miss training, as he has done, that will be the situation.

Not in 20 years in management have I ever gone down this route but I feel I have to make a stance because I will not put up with it on my watch. \n“He has decided the team has picked itself. How can I pick him when he doesn’t come into training? \n“His failure to turn up for training has happened more than once. Everyone can have an excuse but when it is more than once I will not accept it.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
