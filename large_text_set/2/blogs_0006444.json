A brief burst of snow in the hours before and around sunrise may be enough for some schools to delay openings on Thursday. [ A Thursday morning snow blitz is forecast to follow today’s 70 degrees ] \nThe best chance for delays will be in jurisdictions north of the District where the changeover to snow will occur earliest and temperatures will be coldest. Montgomery, Frederick, and Howard counties have at least a 50-50 chance of a delayed opening. We could even see Frederick County, where several inches of snow are possible, deciding to close for the day. \nTo the south, the school decision will be a tough one. Around the time schools have to make a call — around 4 a.m., it may well be raining. The changeover to snow could then occur between 5 and 7 a.m. Schools could open on time only to see rain turn to a burst of heavy snow and falling temperatures. However, while any snow burst could lower visibility and cause some slushiness, above freezing road temperatures should prevent widespread iciness. \nThe bottom line is that most schools, except those in our northern areas, should be able to operate normally tomorrow. But, because of that possibility of brief, disruptive burst, parents should closely monitor conditions in the morning. \nNote: We are not issuing FedCast as we do not believe conditions will merit altered Federal government operations. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:42:45.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
