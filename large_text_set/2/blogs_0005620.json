Here's the list the White House sent of attacks they feel \"did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources.\" pic.twitter.com/lj8eOZQfnY — Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) February 7, 2017 \nT he most deadly attack on the list was the bombing of a Russian plane over Egypt in October 2015. All 224 people on board were killed. \nThe second most deadly incident was the Paris attack in November 2015 in which 129 people were killed and hundreds more wounded in several simultaneous attacks across the French capital. \nFrance is the most mentioned country out of the 26 to feature on the list. Thirteen of the 78 listed attacked were in France, followed by the USA in second with 11. \nEurope was the scene of 33 of the 78 incidents, accounting for 334 deaths - the most for any continent. Trump's list has a Western focus \nT he latest edition of the Global Terrorism Index found that the total number of deaths caused by terrorism decreased by 10 per cent to 29,376 in 2015, reversing a four-year upward trend. \nThe five countries with the highest total impact from terrorism were Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria. These five countries accounted for 72 per cent of all deaths from terrorism in 2015, with a total of 21,059 people being killed. \nT rump's list only includes two attacks from these countries: an attack in Karachi, Pakistan, in April 2015 that wounded one, and an attack on the Afghan capital of Kabul in June 2016 that killed 14 people. \nThe list instead focuses on Europe and North America with 46 of the 78 attacks taking place in these two countries. \nWhile it's true that ISIS and its affiliates more than doubled the number of countries in which they were active last year, expanding to 15 more countries including many in Europe, the continent has relatively few terrorism-linked deaths. In 2015, just over 500 people were killed by terrorism in Europe - the majority of which in the Ukraine and France.
