Files Charges Against Activists Who Exposed Planned Parenthood Scheme \"... very, very unpleasant truth ...\" Share on Facebook Share Tweet Email Email Print   \nTwo anti-abortion activists have been charged with violating California’s privacy laws when they exposed Planned Parenthood’s alleged sale of organs harvested from abortions. \nCalifornia’s Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who announced the charges against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, said they invaded the privacy of medical providers by filming without the providers’ consent. Bogus charges. @PPact @CecileRichards said under oath, taped convos NOT \"confidential\"…we call her as 1st witness? https://t.co/0Sfd1zkCEK \n— David Daleiden (@daviddaleiden) March 29, 2017   Beck Suspends Tomi Lahren For Abortion Comments, Criticizes Her Logic \nThe charges relate to filming 14 people between October 2013 and July 2015 with one additional charge of criminal conspiracy to invade privacy. \nThroughout 2015, the Center for Medical Progress released a series of undercover videos revealing the full extent of the massive amounts of money Planned Parenthood makes selling organs from aborted fetuses. CMP statement on the bogus charges for citizen journalism brought by @PPact political cronies against @daviddaleiden https://t.co/0Jff0Dkezj   \n“The bogus charges from Planned Parenthood’s political cronies are fake news,” Daleiden said in a statement. \n“We look forward to showing the entire world what is on our yet-unreleased video tapes of Planned Parenthood’s criminal baby body parts enterprise, in vindication of the First Amendment rights of all,” the statement read \n“The public knows the real criminals are Planned Parenthood and their business partners,” he added. The last time @PPact colluded with political cronies to persecute citizen journalists, both charges AND corrupt DA thrown out! BRING IT ON!! \n— David Daleiden (@daviddaleiden) March 29, 2017  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T21:07:24.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
