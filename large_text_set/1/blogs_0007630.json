Anderson, and Sheryl Lee in the original run of Twin Peaks . ABC/Spelling Ent./CBS Paramount Domestic Television \nAfter a tumultuous development process that included thrills , chills , and a walkout from director David Lynch (who then returned ), Twin Peaks finally has an airdate, Deadline reports . The show, which had a two-season run on ABC from 1990 to 1991, will return to Showtime on May 21 with a two-hour premiere. David Nevins, Showtime’s president, announced the news Monday at the network’s session at the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour, telling attendees, “It’s really happening.” \nThe new season is 18 episodes long, and was envisioned as a “close-ended one-time event,” though Nevins didn’t rule out another season. New episodes will be released weekly, rather than all at once, although Showtime subscribers will be able to stream episodes three and four immediately after the premiere airs.

Asked how he and show co-creator Mark Frost worked so well together, he replied, simply, “Mark is very smart.” Meanwhile, the show’s cast members gave less information using more words: asked if she was playing Diane, the never-seen assistant to Kyle MacLachlan’s Agent Cooper, Laura Dern answered, “I am not at liberty to discuss anything except how incredibly excited I am to join these guys.” \nIn lieu of further Twin Peaks details between now and May 21, here’s one of the Los Angeles weather reports David Lynch used to put on his website, from Halloween 2008. Happy Halloween (2008)! \nMatthew Dessem is Brow Beat’s nights and weekends editor and the author of a biography of screenwriter and director Clyde Bruckman .
