Chelsea vs Manchester United: FA Cup preview \nConte is full of respect for the Special One's achievements during his time at Chelsea and said: \"His history with Chelsea was great. I know very well he's in the heart of Chelsea's fans. \n\"It's great this because he deserves it. For sure, I hope in the future to emulate his wins here.” \nMourinho used to be worshipped by Chelsea's following but has made numerous digs at his former club's expense since moving to Old Trafford last summer. Chelsea v Man United: FA Cup match preview \nBut Conte believes that won't damage his status as a Chelsea legend. \nHe added: \"Jose Mourinho wrote a good part of the history of Chelsea. He won a lot with the players. He did a great job here in Chelsea. It's important, always, not to forget this. \n\"I have great respect for him because he's a winner. I like his mentality. He has a winning mentality. For sure, he's one of the best in the world and, here, he did a great job. I think every single fan must respect him.” Read more Conte plays down Pogba vs Kante battle and warns Chelsea over Utd star \nMourinho has made many negative comments about Chelsea's style of play. Only last month he sneered about the praise the Blues and Conte were getting by saying: \"To be good in counter attack is suddenly art.\" \nBut Conte has revealed that it is a tactic that he hasn't spent any time practising all season and just comes naturally to his players during the 90 minutes. \nHe said: “I have to tell you one thing, not only here... but I never, ever, ever train for the counter-attack. Never prepare for the counter-attack. Never. Chelsea vs Manchester United: Head to head \n\"I think the counter-attack is an option, above all if you have this type of player, players who are very, very fast. \n\"Diego Costa is a counter-attacking man, Eden Hazard, Willian and Pedro. It's normal to have this situation with space, so they know what they can do. \n\"For me, it's important to train the other aspects: when we have the ball, when we stay almost always in our opponents' half, to prepare when we are attacking. It's very difficult to train counter-attacking, but it's not my priority.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T00:36:28.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
