(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) \nWASHINGTON • Workers from AES Electrical apparently went all out to make sure Donald Trump could open his luxury hotel on the day he wanted. \nIn the frenzied final six weeks of work at the hotel, while Trump touted the project on the campaign trail, AES of Laurel, Md., claims it assigned 45 members of its staff to work 12-hour shifts for nearly 50 consecutive days to get the lights, electrical and fire systems prepared on time. \n\"We had people there well over 12 hours a day for weeks because they had a hard opening of Sept. 12 and you can't open if the lights don't work and the fire alarms don't work and the fire marshal can't inspect it,\" said Tim Miller, executive vice president of AES. \"There is a lot of work that went into that hotel, and it didn't happen by accident.\" \nTrump got his wish: The hotel was ready enough that on Sept. 16 he held a campaign event there honoring veterans, which was carried live on national television. He touted the hotel as having been completed \"under budget and ahead of schedule\" and said that when it opened officially the following month it would be \"one of the great hotels anywhere in the world.\" \nBut around the same time, Miller said, the Trump Organization and its construction manager, Lendlease, stopped paying AES. Three days before Christmas, AES filed a mechanic's lien with the D.C. government alleging that it was out almost $2.1 million. \"Merry Christmas and a happy new year to us,\" Miller said. \nThe AES filing brings the total of allegedly unpaid bills on the hotel to more than $5 million. Washington-area plumbing firm Joseph J. Magnolia Inc. and Northern Virginia construction company, A&D Construction, are seeking $2.98 million and $79,700 respectively. \nA representative for Lendlease has referred comment on liens to the Trump Organization. In an emailed statement, the Trump Organization did not address the specifics of the legal action. \n\"In developments of this scale and complexity the filing of nominal liens at the conclusion of construction is not uncommon as part of the close out process,\" a representative for the company wrote. \"In the case of Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C., the Trump Organization has invested over $200 million dollars into the redevelopment of the historic Old Post Office and is incredibly proud of what is now considered to be one the most iconic hotels anywhere in the country.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T05:08:53.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
