When humans appear in Kuno's work, they have the dazed expressions and wide-set, pale faces of medieval paintings . Their environments are clothed in the colorful, yet muted, palette of Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights , and convey the same frenzied, hungry energy that has attracted viewers of the iconic painting for hundreds of years . \nKuno creates this aesthetic with an alchemical mix of graphite, watercolor paint, ink, imitation gold leaf, and paper on wooden panels. \"I mount the paper on the panels, then put the gold leaf on in an asymmetrical organic shape so it looks kind of like a melting or breaking frame,\" The St. Paul, Minnesota artist tells Creators. \"The composition of the figures are based on symbols like swastikas or crosses or stars, then I make up the narratives as I go along and try to improvise as much as I can. Once I have a finished drawing in pencil I'll add layers of watercolor and acrylic paint, then refine it with ink, markers, pastels, or whatever I have laying around. Then I'll seal it with cold wax medium and that gives it kind of a weird effect.\" \nArchenemy Arts recently showed Kuno's latest work at a show called PULP , highlighting artists who work on paper. For the occasion the artist donated the proceeds of a limited run of prints to the ACLU.
