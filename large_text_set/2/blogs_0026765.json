Having just survived the last two cup rounds against Union Berlin and Hertha Berlin in penalty shootouts, the luck of the draw pitted the Ruhr Side against arguably the weakest side of the remaining eight teams, third tier Sportfreunde Lotte. \n\"On paper, they are a third-tier side, but their performance level is equal to a 2. Bundesliga team,\" Tuchel told his news conference on Monday, adding: \"They are a very aggressive and a very emotional side.\" \nIt will be a typical cup scrap in the Sportpark am Lotter Kreuz -- a stadium that fits 10,000, and where none of the four stands looks like the other. The last two home games in the league of Lotte had to be postponed due to the \"unplayable\" condition of the pitch, which should make things more difficult for the favourite to dissect a team that knocked Bundesliga sides Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen, as well as 2. Bundesliga team 1860 Munich out of the competition. \nA quarterfinal in the German Cup is the biggest match in the 88-year-long history of the club from a small town in the Northwest of North-Rhein Westfalia that has about 14,000 inhabitants. It should, of course, be a straightforward win for Black and Yellows, who are back in form after back to back 3-0 wins against VfL Wolfsburg and SC Freiburg in the league. \n\"We continued in Freiburg where we left off against Leipzig, Hertha, Benfica and Wolfsburg. We're on a good way,\" Tuchel said. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is looking to further increase his confidence against Lotte. \nBut Dortmund have made it a habit this season out of showing complacency on the road against inferior opposition. A shocking 2-1 loss in Darmstadt a fortnight ago was already their fourth away loss in the league. The cup game in Lotte will be another litmus test for BVB's attitude in a low-profile match, where they have little to gain but a lot to lose. \nThe match on Tuesday night should be an opportunity for some of the fringe player to make a lasting impression. The Ruhr side will have five matches within 21 days, in which Tuchel will have to make some rotation to have fresh legs on the field. The likes of Shinji Kagawa, Christian Pulisic, Emre Mor and Mikel Merino -- who haven't been starters in recent games -- could find themselves in a rotated starting XI. \nThe Dortmund coach was coy about revealing whether Roman Burki or Roman Weidenfeller will be between the sticks. Weidenfeller has been designated as the \"cup goalkeeper.\" But Tuchel might not want to tinker with his back line too much as centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos will be out due to a suspension (illness would have kept him out either away). Tuchel also mentioned on Monday that winter signing Alexander Isak is ruled out for the game due to muscle problems, which suggest that the 17-year-old striker was about to be included in the squad for the first time since arriving in Dortmund. \nHowever, the game could become a straightforward win if Dortmund finds an early opening, which then would be a good opportunity for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to further increase his confidence. The 27-year-old scored a brace on Saturday against Freiburg, clearing his head from an impressive streak of glaring misses. \nThe Black and Yellows will need their star striker in top form in tricky matches to come against Bayer Leverkusen in the league and the following return leg against Benfica in the Champions League. And, ideally, the Gabon international finds the back of the net another time in Lotte before an early substitution saves some energy for straining weeks to come. \nFor Dortmund, the match in Lotte has little glamour, but it's a key game for them nonetheless to maintain momentum while keeping their hopes of silverware alive. \nStefan Buczko covers Borussia Dortmund for ESPN FC.
