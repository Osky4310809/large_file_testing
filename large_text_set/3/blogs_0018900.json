They should keep me from getting hungry but, more importantly, they need to entertain and distract me from how much I despise flying. Advertisement \nBut packing a good snack bag isn’t as simple as throwing a bunch of your favorite foods into your carry-on. Besides following TSA regulations, I have a few rules of my own: No crumbly, fragile nonsense that can’t survive a stint in my poorly-organized backpack. Priority is given to taste, but there should be some nutrition involved. Flying already makes me feel physically bad, so eating nothing but Snickers bars and Cheetos is a bad plan. Finger foods only. I don’t want to have to ask anyone for anything, like utensils (which they probably won’t have anyway). Nothing offensively smelly because that’s just rude and tacky and I’m not as tacky as I look. I also like things that come in neat little single-serving sizes, but this isn’t crucial because Ziploc bags and bento boxes exist. \nIn my many years of shopping for plane snacks, I’ve found I’m most consistently pleased with the selection at Trader Joe’s. Trader Joe’s isn’t a normal grocery store, it’s a cool grocery store, and their food is just plain (plane) fun. They also, as a company, seem fairly obsessed with snacks, which is my personal aesthetic, and these are my favorites: All of the Dried Fruit \nI have been eating these mango and pineapple slices for as long as they’ve been available for purchase, and their chewy, slightly sour nature is perfect for air-travel. Not only do they keep your jaw moving—and ears popping—but sour things can help with any motion sickness-related nausea. If tropical fruits ain’t yo’ thang, TJ’s has a wide variety of other dried (and freeze-dried) produce, like apples, peaches, apricots, and all kinds of blueberries. Oh, and if you like your dried fruit a little on the juvenile side, there are always these beauties, which are cheap, tasty, and reminiscent of the fruit snacks of my youth. Lotsa Nuts and Mixes of Nuts \nJoe—if such a trader even exists—must be nuts about nuts, because his namesake store is full of raw nuts, roasted nuts, candied nuts, and everything in between. ( Harlan Pepper would love it .) I’m partial to the candied pecans. \nThen there’s the trail mix, a.k.a lots of different nuts mixed together, along with some other stuff. Nuts and trail mixes are great plane food because they’re easy to eat, filling, and (by my standards, at least) pretty good for you. If you want to be virtuous, grab a bag of the Go Raw Trek Mix , which is surprisingly tasty in spite of its lack of salt and chocolate chips, or you could be like me and grab some super sexy Tempting Trek Mix, which comes in convenient little handfuls. I’m a natural at holding these things. Easy Olives \nOlives, with their pits and their brine, don’t seem like a good travel companion at first blush, but TJ’s has removed the pits and packaged them in convenient little brine-less packets. Not only are they a perfect salty snack—especially if you bring a little charcuterie, which we’ll get to in a moment—but you should probably plunk a few in your in-flight Bloody Mary or martini . I love all of the olives. Meats and Cheeses I love a salty stick of meat. \nTrader Joe’s has a pretty decent selection of what I like to call “Lunchables for grownups” and they’re super portable and packable. The little Citterio meat sticks are small, snappy, salty, and addicting; the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella (ahem, string cheese) is all things that are good in one package, and the Genoa salami/provolone combination is a glass of Chianti short of an Italian picnic. You could pack crackers or bread to go with these bits of charcuterie, but crackers can crack, and bread gets smushed, and I don’t like crumbs. Advertisement Advertisement \nIf you don’t eat meat, but would like to get in on that cheese action, TJ’s also has a great variety of portable dairy. I like their Fresh Goat Cheese Medallions , but those can be a little crumbly for traveling, and I absolutely live for their Fresh Mozzarella Sticks, which look like string cheese, but do not string, and taste of fresh, creamy, dreamy mozz. Oh no someone help that cow. Chocolate, Duh These bars are the perfect size. \nA plane ride is not a plane ride without some candy, and Trader Joe’s has really excellent candy. I’m a chocolate-loving individual, but they have a really great selection of gummies and licorice, if that kind of thing is your bag, baby. They have big tubs of peanut butter cups and chocolate covered almonds that you can repackage into smaller, travel-friendly portions, but peep the check-out aisles for little packages of your favorites. \nThe one not-chocolate candy I have to have while traveling is the Ginger People’s Ginger Chews. I have always had motion sickness issues, and these super-gingery candies calm a sickly stomach like you would not believe. Their mascot is a problematic cannibal, but we’ll ignore that. \nThey also require a good bit of chewing, which is great if have ear and sinus pressure issues while in the air. Breath Freshening Agents \nUnless you brought a tiny toothbrush in your carry-on (and used it), your breath will probably be as stale as the cabin air by the time you touch down. Luckily, Trader Joe’s carries my favorite brand of mints (Myntz) which I have only been able to find at TJ’s or online . They’re pretty strong, sugar-free, and are “recommended by dentists,” for what that’s worth. (Like, nothing against dentists, but “four out of five” of them are always recommending something . I want to talk to that fifth dentist; they seem to have very high standards.) Sponsored \nThose are all the tasty reasons I make a pre-plane stop at Trader Joe’s. Can you purchase similar items at other grocery stores? Sure, but I know and love these exact brands, and I know I can get them in one trip. Will that trip be marred by the impossibly poorly-engineered Trader Joe’s parking lot? Yes, but the fact that I’m willing to deal with that should tell you how dedicated I am to these plane snacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:47:16.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
