Scott Mahaskey Schumer blasts Tillerson on Russia sanctions Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday criticized Rex Tillerson's unwillingness to commit to maintaining sanctions against Russia, signaling that Democrats plan to escalate their case against Donald Trump's chosen secretary of state. \nTillerson told senators at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that he would have to examine the slate of current and proposed sanctions before deciding how to proceed, adding that he and Trump have yet to discuss Russia. The former ExxonMobil CEO's answers on sanctions are likely to deepen bipartisan concerns about whether he would be prepared to get tough on Moscow in light of intelligence reports that Vladimir Putin's government orchestrated cyberattacks to disrupt the U.S. election. Story Continued Below \n\"You don't need a classified briefing to know what Russia has done in the past,\" Schumer said of Tillerson in a floor speech. \"To duck the question and refuse to commit to continuing these sanctions is tantamount to sweeping international laws under the rug. It says, 'Go ahead, interfere in our elections again. Nothing will happen to you.'\" By Kaitlyn Burton and Kelsey Tamborrino \nTillerson testified as the president-elect and Republicans grapple with the fallout from explosive reports that U.S. intelligence officials briefed Trump on allegations that Russia had collected damaging material about him. Schumer only subtly broached that topic, calling the reports \"extremely troubling,\" and focused on fomenting bipartisan uncertainty about Tillerson's openness to rapproachment with Russia. \n\"If Mr. Tillerson cannot even say he will support the existing sanctions, what kind of secretary of state will he be? I’m worried,\" Schumer said. \nRepublicans can lose three votes from their side of the aisle without Tillerson's confirmation being threatened, though attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) suggested during Tuesday testimony that he might step aside from voting on other Trump nominees. That would narrow the GOP margin for error on Tillerson to two votes. Some moderate Democrats, however, might back the former ExxonMobil. By Nahal Toosi and Burgess Everett \nSchumer also noted during his speech that Sessions has yet to commit to sanctions against Moscow. Earlier on Wednesday, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) seized on Sessions’ reluctance during Tuesday testimony to recuse himself from any potential probes into Trump advisers’ connections to Russia. \nSessions’ noncommittal stance came before reports that U.S. intelligence officials briefed Trump last week on allegations that Russia may have compromising information about him. \nPrompted by Durbin, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey testified that an attorney general would have the power to stop an investigation underway by the FBI. And the Illinois senator raised questions about whether Sessions — Trump’s first endorser in the Senate — could be sufficiently independent on any Russia probes involving the president-elect. \n“I sense evolving context relative to Russia and the involvement of Russia in the election,” Durbin said during the second day of Sessions’ confirmation hearing, when the Judiciary Committee brings in outside witnesses. \"Now I think there is a growing concern … about his role if he becomes attorney general, vis-à-vis the White House, the president.” \nSeung Min Kim contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T20:49:32.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
