The single first appeared on J. Holiday's Back of My Lac' album and climbed to Number Five on Billboard's Hot 100. The version on West's SoundCloud is unadorned compared to the original, with mostly singing from The-Dream, reverberating bass and simple strings. There are moments when gentle background singing brings the song close to gospel. \"Love is war, I'm your soldier,\" The-Dream croons. West's vocals, meanwhile, are indiscernible. \nThe year that \"Bed\" came out was an important one for The-Dream. Another single he helped write, Rihanna's \"Umbrella,\" became a Number One crossover hit in 2007. The-Dream also released his debut solo album, Love Hate . He later collaborated extensively with West, resulting in Grammy winning tracks like \"All of the Lights\" and \"No Church in the Wild.\" The-Dream is also featured on West's \"Ultralight Beam,\" which was nominated for a 2017 Grammy Award earlier in February \nKanye West has used his Yeezy line fashion shows to debut new music on several occasions: In fall of 2015, those near the runway were entitled to an early taste of \"Fade,\" which later appeared on The Life of Pablo . In 2016, West premiered a version of The Life of Pablo front-to-back during a Yeezy show at Madison Square Garden.
