After all, the animals are from Ocala, FL so this is the first winter they’ve been exposed to snow. \nTheir owner says it wasn’t until 9:00 this morning that he realized they had escaped from the stable. Nasso says a neighbor called him saying the police were looking for his horses. \n“I was concerned they were going to hurt somebody or they could’ve hurt somebody,” he said. So he immediately jumped in his car, noticing less than a half mile down the road that police were protecting his beloved ponies. \n#NOW #ESU #Truck5 assists the @NYPD123Pct in wrangling in these runaway ponies in #StatenIsland .

Luckily for little Julia, both Blondie and Jules will sleep a bit warmer tonight. \n(© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.
