The partner is building a golf course designed by Tiger Woods. \nAs detailed by senior media correspondent Brian Stelter, the tape of Trump’s comments wasn’t via a reporter or news outlet, but from a guest who was in attendance at the event. He also noted that this helps enforce the concerns many have about Trump’s business interests and remaining separate from them in the White House. \n“You can build the highest wall imaginable to restrict Donald Trump from his business interests,” Stelter noted. “And yet he’ll still know what’s on the other side of that wall because he’s had these relationships for years.” \nHe pointed out that the Trump team explained that there was “no business conducted” at the party. Host Erin Burnett said it was interesting that the business partners would travel all the way from Dubai to Mar-a-Lago with their families. \nWatch the clip above to see Trump’s comments, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T03:22:15.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
