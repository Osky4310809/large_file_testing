The system is similar to the one used by Professor Stephen Hawking.

But also for the kids and Liz, [I want them] to hear my voice rather [than] a computer one.\" \nAfter hearing his new voice, he said: \"That's pretty good. It's instantly recognisable. It sounds really good. I know it's me.\" \nThe new voice was developed at a centre in Edinburgh funded by Harry Potter author JK Rowling. \nDr Phillipa Rewaj, a speech and language therapist at the Anne Rowling Clinic, said: \"Your voice is identifiable to other people as your face is. It's very unique to you. So to be able to preserve that is really important for people.\" \nBBC Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire is on Monday at 7.30pm.
