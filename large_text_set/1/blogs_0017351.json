Matthew Mueller Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of \nWhile Paige has been absent from WWE television lately, she's been keeping quite busy alongside her fiance Alberto Del Rio . The two have been appearing all over in recent months, and their most recent engagement was at the Combate Americas weigh-in presentation. \nFor those who don't know, Combate Americas is a newer promotion dedicated to Hispanic mixed martial arts and is run by CEO Campbell McLaren. McLaren is the co-creator of the immensely popular UFC, so he knows a thing or two about this sort of thing. \nIn any case, Alberto El Patron was on hand along with Paige to help with the presentation. Part of that meant posing for pictures, including a few with some very attractive women. Paige shared one of the pictures on Twitter thanks to Alberto looking a bit, well, awkward. \nWhen the Ass kicker is afraid of getting his ass kicked by his fiancée  @VivaDelRio @campbellcombate #AwkwardSmile #StraightArms pic.twitter.com/pMp31d3oIS — PAIGE (@RealPaigeWWE) January 18, 2017 \n\"When the Ass kicker is afraid of getting his ass kicked by his fiancée  @VivaDelRio @campbellcombate #AwkwardSmile #StraightArms\" \nShe was pretty dead on in her analysis of the situation because in another picture he shared on his Twitter account, you can tell he's much more at ease by Paige's side. \nEl Presidente,the First Lady & Campbell !  Combate Americas family !  pic.twitter.com/XnYhQA00J8 — DEL RIO GIRLS (@delrio_girls) January 18, 2017 \nFans who happen to be in San Antonio on Royal Rumble weekend can party with both superstars at the La Cantinita, so even if you can't go to the actual event, getting to watch it with Paige and Alberto is a pretty good consolation prize.
