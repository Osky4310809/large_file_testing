She remains free on $150,000 bail and will be sentenced June 7.\nEmily was accused in a lawsuit by her husband, Kenneth, of trying to execute him with an antique derringer because she “had been having an on-and-off extramarital affair since at least early 2011.”\nShe wanted to take him out of the picture to avoid a “contentious divorce,” according to the suit.\nHer lover, Warren Roudebush, ended his own marriage shortly before the November 2013 shooting and was pressuring Emily to do the same “so that they could be together,” according to the court papers filed in White Plains.\n“With [Kenneth] no longer in the picture, [Emily] could avoid a contentious divorce, keep the marital home and never admit the marriage infidelity to any family and friends,” the suit says.\nThe bullet that struck Kenneth entered at the back of his neck, near the base of his skull, passed underneath his ear canal and lodged in his left cheek. He underwent surgeries to remove the bullet and to repair a severed artery to his brain.\nEmily and Ken Dearden According to Kenneth’s suit, Emily claimed to have been knocked out by an intruder.\nBut cops who responded to Kenneth’s 911 call “seemed skeptical” because there were no signs of forced entry, the home’s burglar alarm wasn’t tripped and the family’s pet Rottweiler didn’t react, the suit says.\nKenneth, a developer and vice chairman of the Yonkers Downtown/Waterfront Business Improvement District, and Emily have two teenage daughters and shared a colonial-style home on Pondfield Road in a posh section of Yonkers.\nEmily, who was hired in 2002, was responsible for evaluating potential NYPD hires.
