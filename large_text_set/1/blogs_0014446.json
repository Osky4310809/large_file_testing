Photo: Bloomberg \nRebecca Ferguson, another British performer, also declined, saying she would perform only if she could sing Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit , a powerful protest against racism and the lynching of African Americans. \nThe big-name line-up, at this stage, is limited to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Radio City Rockettes, classical singer Jackie Evancho who was the 2010 runner-up on NBC's America's Got Talent , rockers 3 Doors Down and country stars Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood. \nTrump has raised a record $US90 million ($120 million) in corporate donations for just three days of celebrations, compared to as many as five days by some of his predecessors – this week there will be just three inauguration balls, compared to 14 for Bill Clinton. \nAnd Trump's traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue will be more of a dash to the White House, taking a planned 90 minutes instead of the more typical four hours of greet and meet. \nEarly plans for a flashier program have been abandoned. They reportedly included a parade on New York's Fifth Avenue, after which Trump was to fly to Washington by helicopter; and what was described as a grand unfurling of ceremonial flags as the Trump procession passed his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. \nRanging from $US25,000 to $US1 million or more for individuals and corporations, donors are to get access to Trump and his inner circle – $US100,000 reportedly buys two tickets for dinner and a policy discussion with select cabinet appointees; $US250,000, gets two tickets to a lunch with women of the first family; and for $1 million, they'll get four tickets to a lunch with cabinet appointees and congressional leaders and four tickets to a dinner with Vice-President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen. \nLast week, Trump promised an inauguration that would be \"very, very special, very beautiful\" and predicted \"massive crowds\".
