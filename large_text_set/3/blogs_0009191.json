David Moyes' team will need a miracle to avoid demotion to the Championship in May. \nMiddlesbrough, who were busy being knocked out of the FA Cup by Man City, also look in major trouble but can put themselves back in the mix by winning the game in hand they hold over Swansea and Hull. After their win against West Ham, Bournemouth will probably need only a couple more wins in their final 10 matches to ensure safety. THE SILVA EFFECT CONTINUES \nIt looked as if Marco Silva's honeymoon at Hull City may have ended last weekend when the Tigers were beaten by a back-in-form Leicester City. That result followed a 1-1 draw at home to Burnley that looked as if it might prove a costly two points dropped as Hull sunk back into the relegation mire. \nBut on Saturday, faced with a must-win match against Swansea City, Silva proved that his team will stick around for the rest of the fight. Hull are still massively at risk, to be sure, but they are giving it more of a go than many thought possible. \nHarry Maguire has emerged as a potential England candidate at centre-back in recent weeks, while Sam Clucas is shining in midfield. Clucas was playing in the third tier as recently as 2014-15, while Maguire had been picked up from the same level just a season earlier. \nAnd perhaps the most unlikely star of all has been Oumar Niasse, who scored two goals off the bench to continue his Premier League rebirth after a miserable spell at Everton. The Senegalese was not given a chance by Ronald Koeman but is now showing why the Toffees saw Â£13.5 million of value in him last February. ALSO OF NOTE... \nAfter netting a hat-trick against West Ham, Josh King has now scored eight goals in his last seven Premier League appearances. He had tallied just three in his first 20 league games this season but ended an eight-game winless run for the Cherries by firing them past the Hammers. \nLukaku hits Premier League best tally \nRomelu Lukaku has now scored four goals in seven league games against West Brom, who he spent a year on loan with from Chelsea. He helped to spoil Tony Pulis' 300th Premier League game, with the manager's record now standing at 95 wins, 87 draws and 118 defeats.
