While he was arguing with them, Chief Ekhator signalled the police men to come over, Chief Isekhure ran inside his room immediately and locked up the door. \nThat infuriated the palace chiefs who then ordered for the demolition of part of the palace. \nExplaining their mission, Chief Ekhator told journalists that “This is the process of ostracizing him (Chief Isekhure). Some of the real power house of the monarchical power of the Oba, are here. Information reaching the palace is that some artifacts are being tampered with. Obviously the Oba is the owner of that building, even though in his magnanimous manner, he kept him there to take care of those things. He is like the sceptre bearer of the Oba, he now wants to take the sceptre and run away instead of keeping it for the Oba. The Oba will look for it. We have had cause to secure artifacts and the shrine and possibly the area they occupy it so that it cannot be broken. \n“This house is the Oba’s house. We are not after the man. The Oba has already told him to take those other extensions he built there. But the original foundation of the palace property should remain where it is. It is a monumental structure which we must fortify.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T08:10:06.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
