Inset shows a mugshot of Lim after his arrest. PAUL JUN ROSAROSO/FREEMAN NEWS SERVICE \nMANILA, Philippines - The Department of Justice (DOJ) issued an immigration lookout bulletin on Monday night against the suspect in a road rage shooting incident in Cebu City. \nDavid Lim Jr., 28, surrendered to Chief Superintendent Noli Taliño, Central Visayas police director, at around 2 a.m. yesterday. \nLim was accompanied by his mother, two relatives and lawyer Jun Salantandre, Taliño said in a text message to special assistant to the president Christopher “Bong” Go. \nLim was charged with frustrated murder and illegal possession of firearms before the Cebu City prosecutor’s office yesterday afternoon. \nHe is being held at the regional intelligence division at Camp Osmeña. \nJustice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II issued the lookout bulletin upon the request of Michael Dino, special assistant to the president for the Visayas.   \n“We issued the lookout bulletin to curtail any effort on the part of Mr. David Lim Jr. or those trying to protect him to evade responsibility for the shooting. If he committed the act… he should squarely face the charges,” Aguirre said. \nUnlike a hold departure order, a lookout bulletin cannot prevent a person from leaving the country, but it requires him to ask permission from the DOJ to ensure his return. No special treatment \nPhilippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa denied claims that Lim is being given special treatment. \n“What kind of special treatment? It is just normal for a mother to ensure the safe surrender of her son,” Dela Rosa said. “If you consider that special treatment, it is to our advantage because the suspect surrendered.” \nTaliño said Dela Rosa asked him to call Go, who in turn told him to coordinate with the mother of Lim for his surrender. No warrant \nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court said no warrant of arrest was issued because no case was filed against Lim before the courts yet. \nThe judges in Cebu City are reportedly afraid to issue a warrant for fear of Lim’s family. The suspect is a nephew of alleged drug trafficker Peter Lim, who remains free although he is in the order of battle of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. \nPeter Lim and his brother supported President Duterte in the election campaign. \nInvestigation showed that Lim shot nurse Ephraim Montalbo, 33, following a traffic altercation on F. Sotto street in Barangay Kamputhaw at around 3 a.m. on Sunday. \nMontalbo was hit in the leg and confined in a hospital. – With Edith Regalado, Evelyn Macairan, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Christell Fatima Tudtud, Dale Israel/Freeman News Service  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T05:17:55.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
