It sure sounds like our country and it sure sounds like Donald Trump .\" \nSpeaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., delivered a toast for Vice President Mike Pence , a former House lawmaker and GOP leader who is poised to play an outsized role as a conduit between the White House and the GOP-led Congress. Ryan recounted the times they were summoned to the speaker's office as young lawmakers who then bucked their own leadership. \n\"There is no one I have served with who brings more belief to his work than Mike Pence ,\" Ryan said. \"No one believes more deeply in our country and our people. He is a happy warrior. The president could not have chosen a better partner for his work than Mike Pence.\" Top Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T04:23:59.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
