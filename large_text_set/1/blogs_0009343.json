So, to surprise Gareth, self-described “nerd” Courtney secretly planned for a special guest to walk with her down the aisle. Posted by Courtney Titchmarsh on Monday, December 12, 2016 \nThat’s right, she had a Stormtrooper as her matrimonial escort and not only that, but it looks like Courtney set her dress for stun…ning. \nBasically, that was my attempt to make a deep “Star Wars” cut while complimenting Courtney and it blew up in my face like the first and second Death Star. \nApparently, Gareth got a real kick out of the imperial companion. Courtney told Daily Mail Australia , \nI thought it would be a really fun surprise. The best part is a charitable organization sent the Stormtrooper for free in exchange for a donation to a charity. Posted by Courtney Titchmarsh on Monday, December 12, 2016 \nNo word yet as to whether or not Courtney walked down the aisle to the “Imperial March” instead of the “Wedding March.” \nThe Stormtrooper was sent courtesy of Outpost 42, which is the New Zealand branch of the global group called the 501st Legion. I’ve got to say this Stormtrooper was a great sport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T03:29:56.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
