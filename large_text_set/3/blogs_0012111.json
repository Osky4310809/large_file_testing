(Reuters) \nA CCTV footage of a naked woman asking for help emerged after two days of her being allegedly raped by 5 men in East Delhi. The video shows her walking on the road, naked, requesting passerby from help. According to IE, the woman, who is also a mother of 2 had to jump from the balcony of a flat in the first floor in Pandav Nagar. The video footage shows the woman talking to three men on the road, while one of them was seen gesturing her to help her come down. Although, when she is seen falling on the ground, getting to the road, the three men are found on the other side. It is seen that the woman stops an auto rickshaw and leaves the place. \nThe police informed IE that it was one of these three men who had made the PCR call, after which they were able to trace the autorickshaw. One of the locals, Munni Devi told the reporters that she saw a naked woman begging for help at 5:40 am in the morning following which she threw a t-shirt and a pair of pyjamas at her. The police then took the woman to the Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, where the treatment for her leg injuries was conducted. \nAlso watch: \nThe woman reportedly recorded her statement before a magistrate on Tuesday. The police further informed that 5 people had been arrested. The joint CP of the eastern range, Ravindra Yadav, said that the woman had arrived at the flat with one of the 5 accused of raping her and the police was looking for them. Incidents such as these only raise the question if women are truly safe in the national capital.
