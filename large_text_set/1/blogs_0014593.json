It is symptomatic of the housing affordability issues in the capital.” \nFive years ago almost half of London’s 649 wards had an average price below £300,000. \nOf the 40 sub-£300,000 areas left, 15 are in Barking and Dagenham, five in Bexley, four in Croydon, three in Havering and the others in Ealing, Merton, Haringey, Enfield, Redbridge, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Greenwich and Newham. \nThe cheapest ward is Thames in Barking and Dagenham, at an average £228,386 last year. Charlton Park Lane, SE7 Was: £249,995 (July 2011) Now: £408,000 (Zoopla value) \nMarkets have stayed strong in many of these once less fashionable areas as buyers and investors shift from expensive central addresses saddled with high stamp duty. \nRecord low mortgage rates and Government-backed schemes such as Help to Buy have stoked already intense demand. Gorseway, Romford RM7: Was: £240,000 (July 2013) Now: £368,000 \nMore than half of London boroughs now do not have a single ward with prices below £300,000, with the most dramatic turnaround in Waltham Forest. \nFive years ago, 19 of its 20 wards were in sub-£300,000 territory, but last year none were. Revealed: the four London boroughs with average prices below £400k \nThe number of wards with prices above £1 million rose slightly from 51 to 52. The most expensive was Knightsbridge and Belgravia in Westminster, at an average of £4.28 million — almost 19 times more than in Thames ward. \nSeb Klier, campaign manager at the Generation Rent group, said: “The £300,000 mark is about the maximum a couple who are both earning average salaries, and have managed to save a substantial deposit, could afford in London. Aveling Close, Purley CR8 Was: £265,000 (October 2014) Now: £336,000 \nWith unstable, expensive renting the only option for most, the Government must give the Mayor powers to regulate the market properly.” \nPaula Higgins, of the HomeOwners Alliance, said: “Without parental support, young Londoners on normal salaries are effectively priced out of over 90 per cent of the capital’s properties.” Pinner Green, Pinner HA5 Was: £285,000 (August 2012) Now: £432,000 \nMayor Sadiq Khan’s deputy for housing, James Murray, said: “The Mayor has been clear that fixing the housing crisis will not happen overnight. \n\"He is introducing planning measures to boost affordable housing and will use funds secured from Government to build 90,000 affordable homes — two thirds for first-time buyers.” \nRoger Harding of housing charity Shelter, said: “It’s crucial he delivers if we are to prevent a generation of Londoners losing all hope of having a place to truly call home.\" \nWards below £300,000", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T14:24:00.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
