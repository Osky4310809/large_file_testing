I might get distracted. That’s why I might miss some of my steps,'” Bolton told PEOPLE of his dance partner after Monday’s show. “She’s obviously beautiful.”\nABC/Craig Sjodin Burgess, 31, couldn’t help but blush while Bonner, 29, gushed.\n“Oh gosh,” she told reporters. “I am a professional. Look, we have a lot of chemistry and we have a lot of fun, but first and foremost we are trying to do a really great job in this competition. I want Bonner to be around until the end and I want to take this man to the finale. That is our priority. Everyone is making a lot of our really obvious chemistry.”\n“I’ll be the first to say that she is as 100 percent a professional as she is beautiful,” echoed Bonner, who previously told PEOPLE it was adoration at first sight for him . “She’s a great teacher. She’s pushing me hard I’m working hard. I just want to make her proud.”\nDancing with the Stars airs Mondays (at 8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T06:53:19.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
