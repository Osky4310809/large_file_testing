We have the absolute sweetest video to share with you. You may remember the rescue of mama pig, Carol , and her piglets by Edgar’s Mission Farm Sanctuary . Carol had given birth to seven tiny piglets in a pound before Edgar’s Mission came to her aid. Now the sweet mother and her babies are safe and sound at the sanctuary. \nThe piglets have even made a new friend since their arrival: Ruby the dog ! In the above video , the piglets and Ruby enjoy some quality play time. As you may be able to notice from her kind and gentle nature, Ruby is the official (and most adorable) Vet Nurse at Edgar’s Mission. This loving pooch is responsible for welcoming new arrivals with a warm wet nose and offering comfort. She takes her job very seriously, as you can see! \nPigs often get a bad reputation as being dirty, stupid animals but in reality, they are incredibly intelligent and emotional beings . Studies have shown that pigs possess the ability to empathize with one another , they can perform tricks just like a dog , and they even come running when they hear their name . Knowing this, the above video carries an even more profound message, these are living, feeling beings. If only everyone knew how wonderful pigs are, the world would be a much kinder place. \nTo keep up with the amazing work Edgar’s Mission does, follow them on Facebook .
