If you had gone on to suggest he would lead a 10 play drive in overtime to win the game with a perfect pass to the corner of the endzone, most would have thought you insane. However, on a bizarre Sunday at Heinz Field, the beleaguered backup quarterback did all that and more.\nRelated: Instant analysis of Steelers' 27-24 win over Browns \nAt the close of the first half, Jones had all of seven completions from 13 attempts for a paltry 62-yards. He was fortunate to have led the Steelers on a scoring drive following a fumble recovery by the defense at the Cleveland 37-yard line, his previous five drives had netted all of two first downs combined and ended with punts. It was business as usual for those who have watched Jones play over the past four years.\nUnfortunately this sums up Landry Jones day… Trips over Gilbert. #Steelers https://t.co/AgtnIF4uJE \n— Blitzburgh (@Steel_Curtain4) January 1, 2017 \nComing out of the break, Jones did little to suggest the fourth quarter performance that was to come. The first two drives ended with yet more punts and just one more first down until Jones threw an inaccurate pass that was intercepted and returned for an apparent touchdown. Miraculously, the Browns defender fumbled into the end zone and Jones might have become the first quarterback to recover a fumble on his own interception for a touchback in Pittsburgh history.\nFrom here, Jones was reborn, leading the offense on an 11-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard run by DeAngelo Williams. On his next possession, the replacement signal caller took the Steelers down the field once again, completing a huge 46-yard pass to Darius Heyward-Bey before finding Demarcus Ayres for his first career touchdown.\nAyers First NFL Touchdown! #Steelers https://t.co/I55C7WCDxE \n— Blitzburgh (@Steel_Curtain4) January 1, 2017 \nNot to be outdone by a late Browns’ rally that saw them tie the game and take a three-point lead in overtime, Jones took charge once again. Our player of the game winner was decisive on a final 10-play drive that covered 75 yards, finishing the game with perhaps the best pass of his four-year career as a Steeler. A beautiful 26-yard scoring pass to Cobi Hamilton that looked like a vintage throw as you might see from Ben Roethlisberger.\nWalk-off. #HereWeGo https://t.co/1zXUKpjc6y \n— Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) January 1, 2017 \nIn what might be his last ever game in a Steelers uniform, barring an injury to Roethlisberger in the playoffs, Jones not only recorded his first real career start, but also his first three touchdown performance in the NFL. His recovery of a fumble in the endzone ultimately resulted in a 14-point swing and in a game when many of his teammates seem unenthused, Jones was a leader refusing to quit.\nOver the years, Pittsburgh’s backup quarterback has been called many things, from a waste of a draft pick to words not safe for family reading. In Week 17 at Heinz Field, Jones was a winner, a hero and more than worthy winner of one of Mike Tomlin’s rare game balls.\nRelated: Steelers to host Dolphins in AFC Wild Card playoffs ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:44:46.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
