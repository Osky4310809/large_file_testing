Here are some highlights from a singular career   10.34 GMT From the book Black and White Dahlov Zorach was born in 1917 in Vermont and was raised by her parents – both artists – in New York City. Growing up in a bohemian atmosphere, she was encouraged to pursue art from an early age.

In 1939, at the age of 22, Ipcar had her first solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Photograph: Dahlov Ipcar/Flying Eye Books From the book Wild and Tame In 1945, she illustrated her first children’s book: The Little Fisherman, a story written by children’s author Margaret Wise Brown . Dahlov would go on to write and illustrate more than 30 children’s books of her own – including Wild and Tame, in 1963.

I Like Animals (1960) focused in on zoo animals.

Photograph: Dahlov Ipcar/Flying Eye Books From the book I Like Animals Ipcar called her own style ‘non-intellectual cubism’. She used four-colour lithography, building up separate layers of colour.

I get within an inch and a half of the canvas. I don’t think I’d stop [painting]. Even if I can’t see anything, it makes me happy.’ Photograph: Dahlov Ipcar/Flying Eye Books Ipcar, pictured in 2007 at an exhibition to celebrate her 90th birthday in Freeport, Maine. She continued working until her death. Her sons said in a statement that she had spent her last day ‘at her easel working on her latest painting’.
