Mondelēz International—corporate owner of Oreo, Cadbury, and Toblerone—is looking for the right person to fill the position of “ chocolate and cocoa beverage taster ”—someone who will provide “objective and honest feedback” on its products. \nThink you’re qualified? Well, you need a “passion for confectionary and taste buds for detection.” The lucky individual who will fill this role will provide feedback in panel discussions of 12 people. Working just seven-and-a-half hours per week, the chocolate taster will work out of a “sensory booth” located at the Mondelēz science park located in Reading, UK. \nThe company won’t say what the salary is, but really—does one need to be paid much for it to be worth it to eat chocolate for seven-and-a-half hours per week?

The company already had 1,500 applicants as of Wednesday, and Mondelēz p lans to stop taking any more once they feel they have received enough. \nIs the job of chocolate taster simply too good to be true? Quite possibly. In a press release, the company said, “We are ‘choc’d’ by the number of applicants we have received for our chocolate taster role in Reading!” \nSo, be warned: Your chocolate allotment may very well come with a helping of bad puns and dad jokes. \nBut it’ll probably be worth it, right? Unless you’re already employed as a Champagne guzzler, sleep-science test subject, or Ben & Jerry’s ice cream namer. If so, let the rest of us have a chance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:21:10.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
