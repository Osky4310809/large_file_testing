It unveiled its new Android-powered flagship tablet – the Galaxy Tab S3 – and now we’re waiting for it to be released. Samsung said that the tablet would be released later in March with prices starting at 670 euro. \nSamsung Germany is offering a good deal to those who pre-order this tablet until March 23rd. Those customers will receive a free Bookcover Keyboard for the Galaxy Tab S3, that’s a 130 euro saving. Samsung announced this accessory with the tablet back at MWC 2017, it adds a robust physical keyboard to the tablet and also doubles as a case. \nThis pre-order deal appears to be limited to customers in Germany at this point in time so it remains to be seen if Samsung will provide a similar pre-order incentive to customers elsewhere around the world. \nUpdate: We’ve heard that this offer has also been extended to pre-order customers in Netherlands and a handful of other markets across Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T14:17:53.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
