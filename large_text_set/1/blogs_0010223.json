Obama Pardons 2016 List By State: Drug Dealers, Gun Offenders Published Updated 8:52 am EST, December 22, 2016 1 Comment By Jessica McBride 8.1k Share Tweet Follow Maurice Cawthon, one of the offenders who received clemency from Obama. (Change.org) \nPresident Barack Obama’s 2016 wave of sentence commutations and pardons has cut short the sentences of career criminals, meth and cocaine dealers, and gun offenders, including some men dubbed the most significant drug dealers in their communities. \nIn some cases, judges had already rejected their bids for sentence reductions, and law enforcement agencies spent years painstakingly building cases against major drug dealers. \nIn other cases, on December 19, Obama commuted the sentences of a series of people imprisoned for life terms over drug offenses because of three-strikes laws, including marijuana dealing, as well as people who demonstrated that they were candidates for a second change. The New York Times described it as “one of the larger uses of the presidential power to show mercy in modern presidential history,” saying Obama has now shown clemency to 1,324 people. \nObama’s pardons went to everyone from a former court staff who took bribes to a former Pittsburgh City Council member, Sala Udin, who was “a onetime Freedom Rider who was beaten up registering voters in 1960s Mississippi.” His offense: “Driving fellow protesters home from the South, he was stopped for speeding in Kentucky and arrested after police found an unloaded shotgun and a jug of moonshine in the car,” said Yahoo News. (Getty) \nThe list so far did not include high-profile possibilities like Hillary Clinton, Bill Cosby, Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Leonard Peltier, each of whom would be a stunning development were it to occur. \nThe White House announced the pardons and commutations in a press release. On December 19, Obama granted “commutation of sentence to 153 individuals and pardons to 78 individuals.” \nHere is a full list broken down by state with some details about what people did: Pardons Taiwan \nCaryn Lynn Camp, fka Caryn Lynn Camp-Kenworthy – Taichung, Taiwan R.O.C.

His father had given him an opportunity for a final spring break. All that was required of Aaron was to drive his father’s friend, Walter, to Florida to look at a potential “flip” house. \nAaron & Walter made it to their hotel late at night and slept late the next morning. Not long after a hot shower and the beginning of a cup of coffee, DEA agents were knocking at the door, throwing Aaron to the ground and questioning him about things of which he knew nothing. What Aaron didn’t know was that the truck he had been driving had a false tank containing $900,000 in cash; cash that was presumed to be used in a drug deal. The truck was also registered in Aaron’s name, though the signature was shown at trial not to be his. \nAfter a mistrial and 2 hung juries, Aaron was found guilty and ultimately sentenced to 30 years in federal prison, where parole is not an option. In 3 of Aaron’s 4 trials Walter testified, for the prosecution, that Aaron was never around drugs or money, or even any conversations dealing with such. His father remained silent in defense of his son for fear of an even larger sentence.” \nOffense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine; Northern District of Florida Sentence: 360 months’ imprisonment; five years’ supervised release (February 17, 2000); amended to 292 months’ imprisonment (November 1, 2015) \nCommutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on April 18, 2017.
