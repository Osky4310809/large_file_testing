England finally got a much-needed first win on the tour in the first game that they dominated completely with both bat and ball. India will have to turn things around quickly to keep this three-match series alive. \nWhile England are expected to go in with the same XI, India might be tempted to make a change or two. Will Mandeep Singh or the young basher Rishabh Pant get a game with KL Rahul failing yet again? Will we see Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the bowling department? Amit Mishra might get a look in too considering the success the other leggie Yuzvendra Chahal had in the first game. \nIndia's focus will lie on making it count at the death. They faltered towards the end of their innings in the first game and they cannot afford a repeat in Nagpur. Welcome to our live blog for the second Twenty20 International.
