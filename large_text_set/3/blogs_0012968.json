Customers in Europe can already pre-order the new tablet for 670 euro and while we can expect the Galaxy Tab S3 to cost around the same in US dollars, the official price hasn’t been confirmed as yet. \nHowever, Best Buy now has a listing for the Galaxy Tab S3 on its website. The retailer’s listing carries a price tag of $599.99 and that seems plausible enough. Pre-orders haven’t been opened as yet, Best Buy’s listing only says that the tablet is “coming soon.” \nSamsung is offering customers in Europe a pre-order incentive. Those who pre-order a Galaxy Tab S3 will receive a free Bookcover Keyboard case . It remains to be seen if this pre-order incentive will be offered to customers in the United States as well. \nThe Galaxy Tab S3 is expected to start shipping across the globe in the coming weeks so Samsung should confirm the official pricing and availability details of the Galaxy Tab S3 for the United States in the very near future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T02:44:16.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
