It is 1943 and World War II is in full swing, as is the Indian struggle for Independence. \nThe cry for freedom is the one that is split into the nonviolent one as propagated by Mahatma Gandhi, and the more violent evolution spearheaded by Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army. \nThe INA is trying to push ahead through Burma and thence to India with the help if the Japanese Army. On the other side are Indian soldiers serving with the British. Kangana Ranaut with Saif Ali Khan in Rangoon. Screengrab from YouTube \nAgainst this backdrop, we're introduced to the three main characters of Rangoon — there's Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), an Indian soldier in the British Army who has spent eight months as a prisoner of the Japanese, first in Burma, then in Singapore. He escapes, earning the respect of his superior officers. \nThen we have Rusi Billimoria (Saif Ali Khan), a studio owner whose career as an action star comes to an untimely end when he loses a hand while performing a stunt. \nAnd then there is Julia (Kangana Ranaut) -- Rusi’s find and muse, leading heroine and darling of the masses. \nThe British Army wants a star to travel to the front lines in Burma to cheer up the Indian soldiers serving there. Rusi is persuaded for business and emotional reasons to send Julia to the front; at the last moment, he is unable to go with her. But the British have promised her every protection, and this she gets in the form of Nawab Malik. \nAs they make their way to the front, the travellers come under enemy fire. Julia and Malik are cast adrift and must make their way back to India against the odds. \nAnd so begins an attraction that perhaps neither has anticipated. But the world, war, Rusi and reality must intrude, and the new lovers must contend with these, in addition to their thwarted passion. \nRight up to the interval, the pace is thrilling. Both the elements that form the mainstay of the story so far — war and love -- are shot at close quarters and in a way that will have you enthralled every step of the way. \nWatch the trailer of Rangoon here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:32:17.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
