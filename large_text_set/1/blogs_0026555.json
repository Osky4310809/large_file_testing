Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nShe will be back with a blast on Monday as loudmouth model Rosie Webster after five years away from the Coronation Street cobbles. \nBut while Rosie is bringing a suitcase filled with trouble for her family, actress Helen Flanagan has grown up and insists becoming a mother to daughter Matilda has changed her for the better. \nIt has also altered her view of her job. “When I left, I wasn’t too sure what I wanted to do. I just knew I wanted to have a break,” Helen says. “I was 21 and I’m 26 now, so it’s completely different. \n“I’ve matured and I’ve got a little girl, which makes you grow up a lot. I see it completely differently now I’ve come back. \n“When I was younger I enjoyed it but didn’t really appreciate what a good job I had. When you go away for a while it can make you really appreciate it.” Read More Corrie's Rosie shows she isn't so dozy as she spots spelling mistake on Cobbles Rosie Webster says her goodbyes (Photo: ITV) \nShe adds: “I think motherhood matures you and makes you a happier person. I absolutely love being a mum, it’s nice to come home from work and see them all excited. \n“I think motherhood gives you a purpose. I’m a lot happier now.” \nSince leaving the ITV soap Helen, who has been with footballer boyfriend Scott Sinclair since 2008, has concentrated chiefly on being mum to baby Matilda, born in June 2015. \nShe took part in I’m A Celebrity in 2012, but since then has chosen to largely avoid the limelight. \nAside from an episode of Holby City in 2015, she has stayed away from acting plus the modelling and partying she was famous for as a wide-eyed youngster. Though one thing hasn’t changed.

In typical soap fashion, things are not straightforward and before long the Websters are joined by the police, who suspect Rosie of drug trafficking. \nIt’s fair to say her modelling career hasn’t gone to plan in American. \nOff-screen Helen also had things to overcome for her return. She says she took acting classes, “to refresh, really”, then faced up to the prospect of being away from Matilda for a whole day for the first time.

But it’s been gradual. \n“I felt like, oh God, this will be a bit strange. You get so used to watching Peppa Pig and things. It was my little girl’s first day at nursery today and I knew I’d cry. \n\"It was fine once I was out the door, I think everybody does that.” Helen also has to juggle learning scripts with her role as mum. She says: “The storylines here can be really full on, but then you could have two or three weeks off. \n“It’s finding the balance. When I was here before I would learn my scripts for the day after as soon as I finished work. \n“Now, there is no time for that. You’ve been working all day and you just want to play with your little girl. Helen Flanagan back on the Corrie set (Photo: Zenpix Ltd) \n“I’ve been learning them here on set, and a lot of the mums learn their scenes here and leave work at work.” \nOfficially, Helen is only due to be back in the show for a few months, but she says she would like to stay longer. \nThe actress also likes the idea of Rosie having a baby in the soap to mirror her own life changes. \nHelen looks relaxed as she chats in the Rovers Return and much calmer than when she faced the media during her previous Corrie stint. \nAssessing her career and life so far, she says: “I don’t think you can regret anything you’ve done because you just learn from everything, but I’m really glad to be back now. \n“I would love to stay for a little bit longer because I am really enjoying it. We’ll see. At the moment I’m really content here. Helen says she is really content to be back (Photo: karis kennedy) \n“It works nicely with being a mum. It would be nice to play Rosie as a mum down the line.” With work going so well, and her mum helping out with Matilda, the only other issue for Helen is finding time to see her boyfriend. \nScott, 27, signed a four-year deal with Celtic in August, meaning he is based in Glasgow for the foreseeable future. \nIt comes after a few years of playing for different clubs, which sometimes left him and Helen living in hotels. \nSo with Helen in Manchester, the actress spends her time away from work travelling to reunite her family. \n“When I get a day off, it’s about getting down to Scotland and spending time with Scott,” she says. \n“It would be different if he didn’t have training every day, but he never gets a day off.” Helen adds: “It’s difficult. This weekend I’ll have my last scene of the day then I’ll be travelling up to Scotland with Matilda, then Scott’s got an away game.

It’s not that far, it’s only three hours’ drive and every weekend I want us to have that, because I think it’s important for us as a family to have those weekends. \n“Me and Scott did go to London at the weekend and it was really nice. It’s important to have that couple time, especially if you’ve been away.” \nDespite the distance, the couple back each other’s jobs. Helen says: “He’s been really supportive because I’ve been really supportive of his career, and it’s actually nice for us to have our own things.” \nThough she admits: “I’m a fan of my boyfriend, I watch his games, but I’m not a football fan.” Helen Flanagan and Brooke Vincent return to Coronation Street on Monday, February 6, on ITV, with episodes at 7.30pm and 8.30pm.
