Mourinho and Wenger also have Manolas on their shopping lists (Photo: Man Utd via Getty) \nBut despite being one of their highly-valued stars, he is reportedly earning only around £25,000-a-week. \nLiverpool could treble that — but they face competition from the still-keen Gunners as well as Manchester United, who also have a long-standing interest in Manolas.
