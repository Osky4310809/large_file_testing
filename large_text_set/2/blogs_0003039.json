They get on really well and are very close. They are virtually inseparable at the moment.” Zoe Ball and Billy Yates (Photo: FameFlynet UK) \nTwo weeks ago the pair were seen kissing after getting out of a taxi in London. They appeared deep in conversation before Zoe hugged her new man, whispered in his ear and repeatedly kissed him. \nOne onlooker said: “They looked like a new couple who are besotted with each other. \n“Zoe couldn’t stop smiling and was very into him, they look great together.” Zoe giving directions during the move (Photo: FameFlynet UK) \nIt is believed the pair met several months ago when they were introduced through mutual friends at the BBC. \nAs well as Antiques Roadshow, Billy has worked on a string of TV shows including ITV’s The Xtra Factor. He runs Billy Yates Media which has just £123 in funds. \nThat is in stark contrast to the fortune of Zoe’s ex Norman, who was once worth an estimated £18million. Norman found fame as bassist with The Housemartins before becoming a megastar as a party DJ. Zoe with the removal truck (Photo: FameFlynet UK) \nOn his Twitter page Billy describes himself as an “award-winning pickled egg scoffer, booze quaffin, part-time lady sniffing, solver of life’s everyday problems.” \nHe doesn’t have children and moved out of his parents house in Darwen, Lancs, in 2004. Zoe split with Norman when it was claimed she tired of the DJ’s teetotal lifestyle. \nThe pair announced “with great sadness” that they were separating in August. Zoe Ball and Billy Yates (Photo: FameFlynet UK) \nThey tweeted: “After many exciting ­adventures we have come to the end of our rainbow. We’re still great friends and will continue to support each other and raise our beautiful children together living next door but one.” \ncracks \nThe couple have two children, 16-year-old Woody and six-year-old Nelly. \nBut cracks in the relationship started to appear when Zoe was snapped snogging 22-year-old boyband singer Tay Tay at a Strictly Come Dancing Christmas party back in December 2015. \nThe singer, who is part of pop group Franklin Lake, claimed his kiss played no part in her marriage split. Zoe Ball and Billy Yates during the move in south London last week (Photo: FameFlynet UK) \nHe said: “Zoe wasn’t happy in her marriage and she decided to cheat. I bet I wasn’t the first or the last. If that drunken kiss was one of the catalysts that ended her marriage then it’s not my issue. \n“She was being a cheat so it’s a good thing for them both to go their separate ways.” \nBut this week Tay Tay told the Sunday Mirror: “I wish Zoe well in her new relationship.” \nFollowing their split it was claimed Norman had been left devastated by the break-up and was hoping for a reconciliation.

Zoe Ball caught chatting on mobile while presenting It Takes Two \nInsiders told how the DJ – who she wed in 1999 at Babington House, Somerset – “adores” Zoe and has always put their “family first”. \nIn 2003 Zoe was forced to admit she was out of control after she was caught cheating on Norman with DJ Dan Peppe. Zoe Ball and Norman Cook (Photo: Getty) \nShe said: “I wasn’t happy. And what I’ve always done in my past when life hit a rocky patch was just run from trouble into the next relationship. \n“I’ve had so many boyfriends and that’s what happened if it ever got difficult.” \nNorman forgave her but it wasn't until 2009 that Zoe put her party days behind her. \nFollowing a three-day New Year’s bender she described as “total carnage”, she cut back on her drinking. \nDespite their split last year Zoe continued living two doors away from Norman. The couple have two properties on a millionaire’s row in Hove. \nThey bought the second from Sir Paul McCartney’s ex-wife Heather Mills, 49, for £2.75million in 2012. Zoe was once known for her hard partying (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nZoe decided to quit drink altogether last year and over Christmas had cause to celebrate after remaining sober for six months. \nShe took to Instagram took to congratulate herself on the milestone, posting an inspiring message aimed at those who pulled her through the tough times. \nShe said: “Not always easy but feels good #gratitude #sobriety #calmness #strength #justfortoday #love. #merrychristmastome. \n“Love & gratitude to some special people who have helped me stay strong.” \nZoe started fronting Strictly Come Dancing’s spin-off show in 2011. \nTaking part as a contestant in the BBC1 show in 2006 is what she says “helped people see me as more of a lady”. \nThough she later admitted the dance show had left her with a “clicky hip”. \nLast night Zoe and Norman refused to comment. \nAnd when asked about her son’s relationship with Zoe Ball, Billy’s mum politely said: “We have nothing to say.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:49:49.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
