When and where is the Inauguration? The inauguration will happen on a massive platform similar to this one (Photo: Getty) \nThe 58th Presidential Inauguration happens at noon local time (5pm GMT) on Friday 20 January. \nThe main ceremonies begin in the morning at the White House and end at a number Inaugural Balls across the city of Washington DC. \nThe most famous bit - Trump's 35-word swearing-in - will happen on a 10,000 square foot specially-built platform in front of the Capitol that holds 1,600 people. \nSome inaugurations have been held at the White House but the modern tradition is to hold them outside the domed home of the US legislature. Who gets to go? Hillary Clinton will be there and we're sure she is thrilled (Photo: AFP) \nThe prime 1,600 guests will include Barack Obama, the Speaker of the House, former Presidents, diplomatic corps, Cabinet members and nominees, Congressmen and women, governors and the joint chiefs of staff. \nSo that'll be George W Bush, who Trump accused of lying about Iraq, and Bill Clinton, who he called \"the worst abuser of women in US political history\". \nThere's also Bill's wife Hillary, who you may remember vaguely from somewhere. \nIt'll be a rare public appearance for former Democratic nominee Mrs Clinton - dubbed \"crooked Hillary\" by Trump during the bitter election campaign - since her defeat in November. \nSince she gave her concession speech it's emerged she beat Trump by a wide margin in the popular vote, even though he won through the electoral college. \nJimmy Carter, 92, is set to go but George H W Bush, also 92, will not attend due to his age. What about celebrities? \nDonald Trump tweeted before Christmas: \"The so-called \"A\" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!\" \nBut it is a modern tradition for musicians to perform as part of the festivities. Beyonce even sang at an inaugural ball in 2009. \nAnd this time it's not been without controversy. \nReports have suggested Team Trump is struggling to find acts that'll perform in his honour after his hard-line statements during the election. \nAmerica's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, 16,will perform the national anthem. Trump's claimed her album sales have \"skyrocketed\" since she was announced. Jackie Evancho, 16, will sing the national anthem \nThe Mormon Tabernacle Choir from Salt Lake City, Utah, is set to perform at its sixth inauguration in a row. But one member quit saying she didn't want to \"endorse tyranny and fascism\". The Mormon Tabernacle Choir will be taking a break from their usual enormous organ (Photo: Getty images) \nSeveral members of the Radio City Rockettes dance troupe will also not perform after the group was signed up, despite Rockette leaders urging them to be \"tolerant of intolerance\". \nSo who else was invited to perform? A few people, it would seem. \nUK X Factor 2010 runner-up Rebecca Ferguson said she was invited, but wouldn't come unless she could sing Strange Fruit - a 1930s anti-racism anthem. \nAnd Charlotte Church says she's been approached by Trump's team - and replied with a strong no. \nShe tweeted: \"Your staff have asked me to sing at your inauguration, a simple Internet search would show I think you're a tyrant. Bye\". \nShe followed her message with four 'pile of poo' emojis. What happens on Inauguration Day? Huge crowds ahead of Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009 (Photo: Getty) \nThere are 9 traditions on the day that are regularly followed. Here they are, courtesy of information provided by the US government. A morning prayer: Franklin D Roosevelt began this tradition for the incoming President in 1933. Presidents Obama, Bush, Bush, Reagan, Truman and Roosevelt all attended theirs at the St John's Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House. The 2 Presidents join forces: The departing and incoming President have a brief meeting at the White House before travelling together for two miles to the Capitol, home of the US legislature and scene of all modern-day inaugurations. Vice President takes the oath: Vice-President-elect Mike Pence will be the first to repeat the oath of office, likely to be read to him by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, on the 'Inaugural platform' outside the Capitol. The President is sworn in: Here's the famous bit. All being well this will be outdoors too - though freezing weather has forced past Presidents indoors as recently as Ronald Reagan in 1985. Trump will likely swear on the Bible. The 35-word oath must be read exactly as in the constitution and in 2009 Obama took it again because a word was in the wrong place. The Inaugural Address: Every President since George Washington has delivered one, ranging from his 135 words to William Henry Harrison's 8,445 words in 1841. ( Expect history to be made. Roosevelt declared in 1933: \"We have nothing to fear but fear itself\". In 1961 John F Kennedy said: \"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\" Everyone say Bye Obama! With that the ex-President usually makes a swift and high-profile exit. Since 1977 this has happened by sending him into a helicopter, but it's also happened by train, car and jet. Time for lunch: A bit like a wedding, the formal bit's now over and gives way to a long afternoon of feasting and partying. The Inaugural Luncheon is held in the Capitol's grand Statuary Hall and includes speeches and food from the President's home state. New York pastrami anyone? The Inaugural Parade: The new President takes up his seat in the Presidential Reviewing Stand (yes, really) to review more than 8,000 ceremonial soldiers, floats and marching bands proceeding down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Think everyone from the Boy Scouts of America to several High School bands. Jimmy Carter broke precedent by joining the parade himself. And finally... Inaugural Balls: Washington DC's high society comes alive with the glitz and glamour of black-tie parties. It's exhausting for the President, who tries to attend every official do. The peak year was 1997, when there were 14 for Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama attended 10 in 2009. The number for Trump is still being worked out.

What is the oath? Barack Obama repeated the oath, 35 words long, after he slightly fluffed the order (Photo: REUTERS) \nFor the President: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" \nFor the Vice President: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T11:38:07.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
