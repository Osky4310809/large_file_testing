Each day, guests will enjoy culinary experiences created for the whole family, including a variety of food, beverage and lifestyle seminars, demonstrations and presentations found throughout Disney California Adventure park. I recently spoke with Linda Votaw, a 44-year cast member who is responsible for special event merchandise at the Disneyland Resort.\n“Designing merchandise for special events is one of the highlights of my role,” she said. “I enjoy visiting locations and seeing guests wearing items I’ve developed. When a guest takes home one of the commemorative products, I know she or he had a wonderful visit to Disneyland Resort.”\nWorking with Disney Design Group artists, Linda and her team found magical inspiration for this year’s commemorative festival products available for purchase at this popular event.\n\n“Mickey Mouse is pictured as a chef to give a nod to the many culinary delights guests will find during the event,” said Linda. “We also incorporated a colorful wine glass to salute California’s rich history of wine.”\nThroughout the festival, guests will find a handful of stylish apparel items for women and men.\n“We looked at popular and trendy silhouettes when designing the apparel,” said Linda. “Guests will find different interpretations of the main Chef Mickey artwork used on the shirts. All of the apparel is connected with the use of wine-inspired colors that really make the artwork pop!”\n\nAs a special treat, several items were made especially for Disneyland Resort Annual Passholders , including an event t-shirt and an oversized, limited-edition pin (edition size of 2,000). Passholders must present a valid Disneyland Resort Annual Passport and government-issued photo I.D. at time of purchase.\n\nLook for select products in locations throughout Disney California Adventure park, including the Studio Store and Stage 17/Festival Gifts; merchandise carts located next to Wine Country Trattoria ; and Seaside Souvenirs . These locations will also carry the Annual Passholder exclusive items.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:12:03.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
