In an age where gender fluidity is not only becoming more prevalent but also recognized, the library employees at the school have started wearing buttons that state, “My pronouns are...” followed by words that they most closely associate with their gender identity. \n\nThe buttons aren’t required by the workplace, but rather are made available to both employees and interested students. Says Rebecca Smith , the KU Libraries director of communications and advancement, “We’ve told all of our front-line employees, if a student asks, give them a button.” \nSigns at the libraries state : \n\"Because gender is, itself, fluid and up to the individual. Each person has the right to identify their own pronouns, and we encourage you to ask before assuming someone's gender. Pronouns matter! Misgendering someone can have lasting consequences, and using the incorrect pronoun can be hurtful, disrespectful, and invalidate someone's identity.\"\nThe accessories and initiative are part of the larger “You Belong Here” campaign for undergrads which aims to create an environment of inclusion for the school’s diverse array of students, including those who identify as gender fluid. The campaign provides signs showing the location of “gender-inclusive” restrooms in the library, as well as directions to reflection rooms and lactation stations, according to the Lawrence Journal-World . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:46:29.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
