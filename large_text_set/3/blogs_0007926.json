This proposal from last night simply does not do that. It does not do the job,\" AFP President Tim Phillips declared.\nPhillips told reporters that AFP has been fighting against Obamacare since the spring of 2009. \"We've spent tens of millions of dollars on television ads, digital ads, radio, hundreds of rallies and events, millions of phone calls and door-to-door knocks,\" he declared. \"We're in this for the long haul.\"\nThe two leaders of AFP came out against the \"Trumpcare\" plan after a \"You Promised\" rally featuring many victims of Obamacare, who gave their remarks and called on Congress to keep their promises and repeal the entirety of Obama's healthcare law.\nAfter his remarks, Hilgemann spoke with PJ Media about what AFP would like to see in an Obamacare \"repeal and replace\" agenda. \"Number one, I think it starts with a full repeal of every word of Obamacare,\" the CEO said. \"That's what they've promised the American people, and anything short of that, in our opinion, is just a non-starter.\"\nBeyond repeal, the AFP CEO said there were many \"good ideas\" proposed by Republicans in Congress, and there should be a debate on which \"replacement\" to go with. \"At the end of the day, if it doesn't incorporate better access with lower cost and better quality of care, then at least for us it's a non-starter.\"\nPresident Trump on 'Obamacare Lite:' There Will Be Multiple 'Phases'\nIndeed, Hilgemann agreed that the term \"replacement\" is a misnomer, since AFP would support a bill that turns health care over to the free market. \"The government-based approach to healthcare isn't working,\" he declared. \"It's failing millions of Americans,\" and they voted for a party which promised to \"get government out of the way.\" Whatever else healthcare legislation should do, \"it should be based on market principles.\"\nAFP President Phillips dismissed the idea that President Trump's declaration of future \"phases\" of the healthcare rollout could help reconcile his organization with the GOP plan, which falls short of full repeal. \"All we can do is look at the language that's been proposed so far, and it's not full repeal of Obamacare,\" Phillips told PJ Media.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/07/americans-for-prosperity-on-trumpcare-this-falls-short-of-republican-promises/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://americansforprosperity.org/tim-phillips/", "https://americansforprosperity.org/luke-hilgemann/"], "published": "2017-03-07T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:40:47.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
