The story was about the fact that she had changed her Twitter avatar, of all things, and the internet was losing its collective mind at how beautiful she was.\nBack then the 19-year-old Hailie said that she was planning to study either psychology or entrepreneurship at Michigan State University. This was just after she graduated with honors from Chippewa Valley High School in Clinton Township, Michigan, was the school’s homecoming queen, in the National Honor Society, Art Club, Key Club, Volleyball and on the Student Council.\nPretty much just what you’d expect from the offspring of Eminem, right? I think we may have just found our new favorite celebrity daughter .\nWell, guess what? She’s now 21, IS attending Michigan State, and yep, she’s still beautiful. Go figure. Also, sadly for all your Spartan bros out there, it appears by her Instagram that she is currently unavailable. \n\n\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t still look though and dream about what it would be like to have Eminem as your girlfriend’s dad, right? (That might actually be a little scary. How about we just stick to looking for now? Probably safer.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH/T FHM \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:17:48.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
