In addition, he said, the proposed legislation has never been communicated to local district superintendents or school boards. \nJamie Baxter, director of legislative policy and advocacy for the Allegheny Intermediate Unit, explained that the latest proposal hasn’t been introduced in the Senate or House yet but senators are working behind the scenes and garnering support for when they introduce it. “It’s really not in any of our best interests for this to move forward,” she said. \nThis is not the first time legislators have tried to pass such a law. During the last session, she said, the move ended in a tie vote with the lieutenant governor breaking the tie to defeat it. Sen. David Argall, R-Schuylkill County, is planning to reintroduce the bill. \nSchool districts will lose all of their ability to govern themselves, Ms. Baxter said. Sales taxes in Allegheny County will rise to 8 percent, with increases in other taxes paid by individuals. In addition, the bill would not eliminate school property taxes. “Folks think they will get no property tax whatsoever. That’s not ture. This bill does not eliminate all property taxes.” \nMr. Freeman concurred, saying districts with any kind of debt would still have to collect property taxes to fund that debt. “This is just a money grab by the state,” he said. “I really do think this is a way to break the teachers’ union too. If they can break the districts, they can break the teachers’ union. I believe that with all my heart.” \nAt a meeting in Peters that included school and township officials on Monday, school board member Lisa Anderson said a fund would be created in the state government with the increased sales and income taxes and then be redistributed to districts. She said the way funding would be determined would be by looking at a district’s previous year’s tax collection, less the district’s debt service. \n“There’s a lot of issues with it,” Ms. Anderson said. “That fund is not guaranteed to increase.” \nThe way it works now is that school districts have the ability to raise taxes to help offset rising expenses. \nAdditionally, Ms. Anderson said if the act passes the district would not see any additional tax money from all of the new commercial and residential developments in the township. \n“Also, what if there’s a recession and personal income and sales tax goes down?” Ms. Anderson said. \n“Right now, funding of schools in Pennsylvania is jointly between residents and businesses,” added township manager Paul Lauer. If the act passes, he said, “As individuals we will take on the entire burden of funding schools.” \nDeana Carpenter contributed.
