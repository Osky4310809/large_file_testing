The claim persists that rather than represent the poor in \"routine\" civil legal matters, that legal services organizations have been diverted to an ideological mission that taxpayers shouldn't have to support. \nAs the executive director of Legal Services Alabama, I know the reality is very different: the real story, versus the \"fake news\", is that we service about eleven thousand clients a year who are a thoroughly representative subsection of ordinary Alabamians. They include veterans who have drifted into homelessness: a few weeks ago, five of our lawyers in Birmingham devoted a day to a clinic for these ex-servicemen who are facing very hard times. The single largest share of our attorney hours are spent on victims of domestic violence, and the largest section of this group is mothers who need court intervention to make their abusers stay away from them and their children. Several of LSA's attorneys focus full-time on elder law, which can mean everything from guardianships to protect the interests of senior citizens to grandfathers who need wills done for them. \nMuch of our caseload involves foreclosures: the Congress I used to serve in never got around to doing much to aid families who couldn't keep up with their house payments when the Great Recession hit. The day that I write this, two of our lawyers are filing a brief with the Alabama Supreme Court arguing that if a mortgage company goes through with a foreclosure, they should have to actually follow the rules outlined in the mortgage: most people would call that basic fairness. \nDoes LSA sue people or companies? Sometimes, the answer is yes, and it had better be. Just as a doctor is obligated to provide the best care for a patient, lawyers are bound by our ethical rules to advance the best arguments and claims available on behalf of our clients. So, when a title pawn company in South Alabama refused to return a senior citizen's car even when the evidence was clear that a dishonest relative had forged her name on a car title loan, we didn't just get the car back, we sued for punitive damages on her behalf. A jury agreed and returned an $80,000 verdict in her favor. \nThe fact is that much of the work we do is never, or seldom, done by the private bar. Even small firms or solo practitioners who \"don't charge unless we win\" usually file only contingency fee cases: they can't afford to fight evictions or foreclosures when there are no fees or damage awards to compensate the lawyers. Most family lawyers shy away from time consuming cases involving domestic violence and live on either uncontested divorces or high income couple custody fights. Our attorneys can steer a client toward Ch. 7 bankruptcy, meant for low income filers, instead of having a private lawyer's incentive to push a poor client into Ch. 13, where the lawyers get paid but the consumer has fewer protections. \nEven the state bar's five volunteer lawyer chapters combined typically handle about a third of LSA's workload: by the way, LSA is the single largest financial supporter of the volunteer program. \nWe hear in today's politics that there is a \"stacked deck\" favoring the connected or entitled. Interesting, that some politicians who lament the stacked deck don't appreciate that its truest form is a courtroom where one side has a lawyer and the other is uncounseled and on her own. If politicians feel the sting of hostile media forces aligning against them, imagine the anxiety of a mother having to face her batterer in court without her own lawyer. \nThankfully, the supporters of legal aid range from 150 national law firms (including Alabama's Balch & Bingham, and Baker Donelson, which has a major presence in Birmingham) to a bipartisan cast of former Attorneys General to all the House Democrats and nearly half the House Republicans when the survival of the Legal Services Corporation was voted on in 2014. These allies know that low income veterans, seniors, and mothers shouldn't be the Americans asked to lead the way in sacrifice.
