The image was captioned, \"#TheNewsIn4Words Unhappily Married to Don.\"\n“She looks miserable,” another user commented on the photo.\n“Yes – and I find it so sad – truly – and his kids – i keep thinking of the madoff saga,” Rosie responded.\nThis isn't the first time Rosie's comments about the President's family landed her in hot water. The comedian had previously shared a YouTube video that suggested Trump's 10-year-old son Barron could have autism.\nThe first lady's attorney Charles Harder ordered for the individual who uploaded the video on YouTube to remove it, and issue a public apology. Harder added that Rosie sharing the video made the rumors worse.\nRosie took to Twitter that time as well to apologize to Melania after hearing about how the rumors impacted her.\n“I apologize to @MELANIATRUMP – i was insensitive in my RT – i am sorry for the pain i caused – it was not my intent – i am truly sorry,\" Rosie tweeted.\nThe feud between Donald Trump and Rosie O’Donnell has been going on for years now, although the president has not mentioned her as much lately.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Fox News reporter Megyn Kelly asked him a question about derogatory statements he's made about women in the past, the Washington Post reported.\n\"Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter,\" Kelly said during one of the debates. \"However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women. You've called women you don't like 'fat pigs,' 'dogs,' 'slobs' and 'disgusting animals.' …\"\nDonald Trump then interrupted Kelly's question, and said \"Only Rosie O’Donnell.\"\nDespite the president's rocky relationship with Rosie, reports about Melania being unhappy with her husband's newly acquired position of power began long before the comedian's retweet.\nIn February, Us Weekly reported that Melania was \"miserable\" as first lady.\n“Melania is unhappy with how her life ended up,” a source close to the family told Us Weekly. “She is miserable.”\n“Don’t let her smile in those photos fool you,” the source added. “She hates this.”\nAnother source dispelled those rumors, saying that Melania “is very happy with her life and supporting her husband and family.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:42:16.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
