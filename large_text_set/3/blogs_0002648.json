The new video, self-directed alongside Nathan R. Smith, resonates with the songs cutting, political lyrics and juxtapose against the song’s slick, mellowed-out production.\nThe visuals contain a lot of strong and evocative imagery. They find Joey in the plains of America, clutching a US flag – with stars and stripes embroidered with paisley to look like a gang bandana – whilst various ethnic minorities are shot by police officers. The video (following a similar theme to Kodak Black’s “Tunnel Vision” visuals last month) ends with a burning cross surrounded by Ku Klux Klan members and people hanging with a noose. Disturbing, yet effective stuff from Bada$$, whose new album All-Amerikkkan Bada$$ drops on April 7th. Watch him talk through the meaning behind they lyrics with Genius, below.\n\nIn other music news, Travis Scott has started his own label, Cactus Jack.
