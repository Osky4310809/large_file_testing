Post to Facebook Tom Brady freaks out after not getting call Calm down, Tom.  //usat.ly/2jKEPQU   Tom Brady freaks out after not getting call Steven Ruiz , USATODAY 10:56 p.m. ET Jan. 14, 2017 4 Shares \nTom Brady didn't get a roughing passer call. He was not happy that he did not get that call and let the referees know that with a pretty intense freak out. \nBrady initially seems to be taking his aggression out on Jadeveon Clowney who continued to tackle Brady after he had let the ball go. It was at the point that Brady probably realized Clowney is 6-foot-6, 267 pounds and decided that go after the old dudes in stripes was a safer option. \nYou have to wonder if another quarterback - say Cam Newton - had reacted similarly, would a flag have been thrown? What do you think?
