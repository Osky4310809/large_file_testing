Unique to the collection is a jigsaw pattern construction, limiting any excess within the pieces. These methods create a clean and considered collection with collapsing volumes and rectilinear silhouettes. Those well-versed in cultural fashion will also notice that the range offers square-cut proportions, a small nod to Japanese influences in details like kimono-style sleeves.\nCheck out the full range above, and let us know if you’ll be picking up anything from the selection.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T10:00:57.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
