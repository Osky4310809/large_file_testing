And today, they’ve unveiled their first song in 22 years, since the release of their final album Pygmalion . The band has signed with Dead Oceans, and they’ve been working on new music. “Star Roving,” the new song, is a grand and sweeping rocker, one with a sleepy-eyed melody but a tremendous guitar sound, and it absolutely recalls the band’s prime. Below, listen to it and read a statement from frontman Neil Halstead. \nHalstead says: \nWhen the band decided to get back together in 2014, we really wanted to make new music. It’s taken us a whole load of shows and a few false starts to get to that point, but it’s with pride and a certain trepidation we unleash “Star Roving.” It’s part of a bunch of new tracks we’ve been working on and it feels as fun, and as relevant playing together now as it did when we first started. We hope folks enjoy it. \n“Star Roving” is out now on Dead Oceans .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T15:42:26.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
