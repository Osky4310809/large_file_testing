'Last Stand is session based and features clear objectives and win conditions, while still incorporating aspects of the Dark Zone such as PvE enemies and Landmarks,' reads the official blurb on Ubisoft's blog detailing the expansion.\nPlayers will need to be at Level 30 to get in on the Last Stand expansion, and the PvP modes will be 4v4 with teams working to control capture points in matches that last a maximum of 20 minutes. The Division's twist on a staple multiplayer mode is that NPC enemies will be patrolling the maps, guarding capture points and awarding points themselves when downed.\nThe expansion will also introduce a new progression system and, of course, new gear.\nUbisoft is yet to put a release date on The Division's Last Stand expansion, but it'll be available soon on the Public Test Servers for Season Pass holders.", "external_links": ["http://tomclancy-thedivision.ubi.com/game/en-US/news/152-282198-16/intelligence-annex-#13-taking-a-stand", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RL6SfE4efy0"], "published": "2017-01-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T14:49:27.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
