Gov. Roy Cooper (D) campaigned on repealing HB2, but is now under fire for supporting a “compromise” that maintains anti-LGBT discrimination. CREDIT: AP Photo/Ben McKeown Late Wednesday night, for the second day in a row , North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore (R) and Senate leader Phil Berger (R) held a press conference announcing that they’d established yet another “compromise” to repeal HB2 with Gov. Roy Cooper (D). They are planning to force it through the legislature on Thursday. The “compromise” is not a clean repeal of the anti-transgender law, HB2. It would maintain much of the discriminatory aspects of the law its replacing.\nThe reason Republican lawmakers are rushing is that the NCAA reportedly set Thursday as a deadline for the state to repeal HB2 or risk losing the opportunity to host any championship games through 2022. This means that Thursday’s “compromise” effort is specifically geared toward making money off all those games, but if the NCAA’s concern was removing discrimination from the law, this effort doesn’t meet the standard.\nThursday’s “compromise” bill actually maintains many aspects of HB2. The law prohibited municipalities from establishing LGBT protections at the local level and mandated that in all public facilities, transgender people could only use facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate. The proposed “compromise” repeals HB2, but then immediately reinstates much of it:\nOnly the state legislature would be able to pass any legislation related to the use of multiple-occupancy bathrooms. Thus, no city or public school could assure trans people that they can use facilities that actually match their gender identity. Municipalities would still be banned from passing any LGBT nondiscrimination protections until December 1, 2020. Cooper agreed to the plan without consulting any LGBT groups. Cooper said he supports the “compromise ,” explaining, “It’s not a perfect deal, but it repeals House Bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation.”\nLGBT group’s anger over the “compromise” has been directed as much at the Democratic governor who promised to repeal HB2 as the Republicans trying to hold onto it.\nThe Human Rights Campaign’s Chad Griffin came out swinging:\nThis \"deal\" does NOT repeal #HB2. It's simply another version of HB2 dressed up in a way desperate lawmakers hope will save state's economy.\n —  @ChadHGriffin \nAny ally of the LGBTQ community cannot support this new version of #HB2. There will be political consequences for those who do, Dem and Rep.\n —  @ChadHGriffin \nGLAAD’s Sarah Kate Ellis similarly called out Cooper for supporting the “compromise”:\nThis is bad, doubles down on discrimination and leaves LGBTQ unprotected @RoyCooperNC we will keep the pressure on - this is wrong. Fix this https://t.co/YS2FlcpLei \n —  @sarahkateellis \nChris Sgro of Equality NC described the proposal as “train wreck that would double down on anti-LGBTQ discrimination,” and the National Center for Transgender Equality’s Mara Keisling called it “a cynical ploy that will continue to hurt North Carolina and transgender people .” She also pointed out , “Gov. Cooper ran his campaign on fully repealing HB 2 and protecting transgender North Carolinians It is an outrageous betrayal that he supports this fake repeal.”\nACLU attorney Chase Strangio, who has been part of the litigation challenging HB2, also highlighted that by continuing to regulate bathroom usage, the “compromise” reinforces the stigma against transgender people.\nDo not be fooled by HB2.0. There is no repeal only the further and insidious targeting of trans people &amp; lives. #RepealHB2 #nofakerepeal\n —  @chasestrangio \nThe reason North Carolina experienced a massive economic blowback is because companies know that discrimination is bad for employees, bad for customers, and overall bad for business. A recent analysis by the AP found that the state stands to lose $3.76 billion in revenue over the next twelve years because of business objections to HB2. That includes lost jobs from companies like PayPal , Deutsche Bank , and CoStar Group that canceled expansions in the state, as well as lost revenue from events like concerts and sporting events.\nSeveral major companies immediately came out against the anti-LGBT “compromise.”\nWe stand w/ @HRC &amp; @EqualityNC in urging North Carolina lawmakers to reject a backroom \"deal\" on anti-#LGBTQ #HB2. #RepealHB2 #ncpol\n —  @LeviStraussCo \nThe economic impact of having legislation that discriminates, $3.76bn over 12yrs. @AP : https://t.co/UjHBWiQGzi Repeal #HB2.\n —  @DowPolicy \n@DowPolicy nice to see you stepping up. #HB2 #discriminates and hurts us all economically https://t.co/lSANpNpweP \n —  @redtrucklabs \nFormer Gov. Pat McCrory (R), who lost reelection and can’t find work because of his adamant defense of HB2, endorsed the compromise, saying it “still respects privacy” — code for the myth that transgender people are dangerous.\nI urge #NCGA &amp; @NC_Governor to finally stick with this deal that still respects privacy and let Supreme Court resolve issue for our nation.\n —  @PatMcCroryNC \nSo far, the NCAA has not issued any comment over the new “compromise.” Earlier this month, however, NCAA President Mark Emmert issued a statement recommitting himself and the NCAA board to “maintaining a college sports experience that is inclusive and fair for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.” He explained that “the bidding process for hosting NCAA events now explicitly asks potential sites how they will provide an environment that is safe, respectful and free of discrimination at the events.”\nIf North Carolina cities are prohibited from passing protections for LGBT people or ensuring transgender people can use the appropriate facilities, then the “compromise” will fall far short of that bar.\nThe Senate is expected to consider the “compromise” first thing Thursday morning, and the House will immediately follow. The last time one of these “compromise” ploys was attempted, back in December, it failed in the Senate .\nNorth Carolina Republicans continue to refuse any consideration of a clean repeal of HB2.\nNorth Carolina attempts bait-and-switch with NCAA, pushes new anti-LGBT bill was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:47:30.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
