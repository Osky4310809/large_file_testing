This far-reaching species soon became a problem for people who feared for their livestock – and so, they began to hunt this wild cat mercilessly, which resulted in an almost complete eradication of this animal from the eastern United States. Only one subspecies was left – the Florida panther . It was one of the very first species that found its way onto the U.S. Endangered Species List in the early 1970s. \nThese beautiful cats are about 6-7 feet long and covered in beige fur with greyish areas on the belly and the chest and black markings on the tip of the tail, on the ears, and around the snout. A characteristic feature of this species is a distinctive patch of fur on the back – the fur there grows in a different direction from the rest of the animal’s coat, which results in a cowlick-like effect. Panthers typically live about twelve years in the wild, normally in warm climates, occupying mainly swamps and wetlands. As a keystone predator , this species plays a vitally important role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. \nToday, the situation of the Florida panther is tragic. There are only 160 Florida panthers left in the entire world and they are located on a piece of land that equals just five percent of their historic range of habitat! They live in southern Florida in such places as the Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress National Preserve. \nThe fact that the Florida panther is so critically endangered makes every threat to the remaining panthers severely dangerous and potentially fatal to the entire species. The threats Florida panthers have to face include loss of habitat, low genetic diversity, feline diseases, and lethal encounters with humans , for instance, the risk of being hit by a car. \nThere is a solution to help save the panther from total extinction, however, the species desperately needs habitat. It is crucial that we help them get a place to live and reproduce – every piece of land that can be conserved for the panthers will make their survival more likely. \nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has protected millions of acres of land, including prime Florida panther habitat, for over fifty years. But that will not continue to happen unless Congress proceeds to fully fund the LWCF. Otherwise, the Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge and Conservation Area and Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge will be unprotected – and the same thing will continue to happen to hundreds of other conservation programs across the country. \nYour support is critical – click here to sign the petition to Congress for full funding for LWCF. It is the only chance to give the panthers the habitat that is imperative for the survival of the species. \n\nImage source: jo Crebbin /Shutterstock Want to read more posts like this?
