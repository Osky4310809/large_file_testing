The controller uses a conductive rubber cord from Adafruit that changes resistance as it’s stretched. This resistance is measured by an Arduino Micro / Leonardo (or a Teensy 3.2), which acts as a USB joystick sending signals to Unity3D. (The game is coded in Unity3D using Spring Joints and Line Renderers.) At this point, the game is a simple prototype where you control the distance of two characters whose arms stretch whenever you stretch the rubber band, throwing little ‘Bleps’ around. You can read more about RubberArms on Baumgarten’s page , as well as his earlier project “Line Wobbler”   , Leonardo , Micro  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:23:18.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
