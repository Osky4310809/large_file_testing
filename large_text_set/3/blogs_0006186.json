(Photo: AFP) \nThe Bayer Leverkusen winger has long been a target for the Liverpool boss and according to the Liverpool Echo he will make the 20-year-old winger a priority. \nBayern Munich and Real Madrid are also keen on the wonderkid, while James Pearce of the Echo told the Anfield Edition : \"I’m not sure if he’s the No.1 target but he’s certainly very high up on Klopp’s summer shopping list.\" \nBrandt said this week he was keen on a move away from Germany and cited Leroy Sane and Julian Draxler as players he's like to emulate. poll loading Will Liverpool finish in the Premier League's top four this season? 5000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T07:14:22.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
