Root has scored 4,594 runs since he made his Test debut in December 2012 \nHe is expected to be presented to the media at Headingley on Wednesday. \nRoot had been Cook's vice-captain since 2015 and was seen as one of three leading candidates to replace the opener, along with Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes. \nCook stepped down on February 6 after thinking about his future as captain in the wake of the 4-0 Test series defeat in India, one he said had left him \"drained\". Alastair Cook says it is the right time for him to step down as England captain, admitting he feels he can no longer commit 100% to the role \nRoot will have time to settle into the role with England concentrating mainly on 50-over cricket until July. \nThey head to the West Indies for three one-day internationals in early March and then play two games against Ireland before the ICC Champions Trophy begins on June 1.
