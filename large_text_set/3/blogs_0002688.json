It also scored just two stars in child occupant protection. \n“We are extremely concerned about the poor result of the Chevrolet Enjoy,” said Global NCAP secretary general David Ward. “There is nothing to enjoy about a zero-star safety score and GM should be embarrassed that it is selling cars with such inadequate levels of occupant protection to Indian consumers. \n“In its 2015 sustainability report, Mary Barra, the chairman and CEO of GM, made a strong commitment that GM will be “an industry leader” in vehicle safety. She also stated that quality and safety for GM “are foundational commitments, never compromised.” Unfortunately, the safety of the Chevrolet Enjoy is clearly compromised and Mary Barra’s call to “Speak Up for Safety” has not yet translated into action in India.” \nMeanwhile, the Ford Figo, tested in Aspire sedan form and with dual airbags as standard, managed three stars in adult occupant protection, although it too received just two stars for child occupant protection. \n“In 2014, our first year of Indian testing, the Ford Figo scored zero stars; this year in our fourth year it has scored three,” said Institute of Road Traffic Education president Rohit Baluja. “Ford has demonstrated that progress is possible and importantly this progress will save lives in India.” \nIn Malaysia, the adoption of UNECE vehicle regulations mean that the base standard for safety is higher than in India, with almost all passenger vehicles sold in Malaysia coming with at least dual airbags. The higher level of standard safety equipment explains the higher base prices of Malaysian-market vehicles compared to their Indian-market counterparts.
