They officially reached peak cuteness that day — with their adorable daughters James and Ines in tow. Or so we thought.\nOn the red carpet of the 74th Annual Golden Globes, the pair reached ACTUAL peak cuteness as the Deadpool actor gushed over his gorgeous wife. “Oh, we’re making her shy now,” he said on the Entertainment Tonight platform , as the camera and all other eyes were on her as she smiled for the paparazzi.\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images She mouthed, “Stop it!” to Reynolds in the playful moment. No seriously: Could they get anymore adorable? And when you look like The Shallows star in a black velvet Atelier Versace gown with gilded gold accents, it isn’t hard to see why Reynolds was head over heels. To be quite honest, we all were.\nSteve Granitz/WireImage/Getty Images With such explosive chemistry and two adorable daughters, one can only wonder whether there will be more children on the way. “I don’t know,” revealed Reynolds. “We’ll see. We’ll definitely have more sex. But we’ll see what happens. It’s not always a guarantee. I’m not a professional athlete, please.”\nThank you to the @hollywoodchamberofcommerce and @20thcenturyfox. This is one of those \"pinch me\" moments. But not in the creepy way my Aunt used to do it. \nA photo posted by Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) on Dec 15, 2016 at 4:57pm PST \nWe’re truly looking forward to seeing these two on the red carpet for the remainder of awards season (and beyond).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:54:14.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
