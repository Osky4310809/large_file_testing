And, my biggest fear is always when I'm not doing it, there's someone else that's doing it. That's my biggest fear in life. When I'm not doing it. When I take a night off for my personal life. When I choose to decompress or relax ... not in the back of my mind, in the front of my mind, my biggest fear is if somebody's not relaxing right now and they're going to stumble upon something. (Photo: Twitter @mashable) \n\"When you get in the studio you have these moments that ultimately propel your career, you have to ask yourself how many of those did I miss by not going in on this given night or that given night. \n\"Because creating music is sometimes all about timing. It's all about me texting this producer at this certain time ... It is truly stars aligning, music is. And It's scary to think of all the (opportunities) you miss because you didn't sit in there. You know? So I try to not let myself have that fear.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T06:25:54.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
