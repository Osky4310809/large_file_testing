By making beauty products inspired by pop culture obsessions like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones , and Hunger Games , the company has tapped into a seemingly unlimited group of savvy and stylish superfans. Now, Storybook Cosmetics is expanding its beauty empire from wand-like tools and magical eye makeup to include liquid lipsticks.\nThe brand recently announced this upcoming launch on Instagram. \"Our first 4 shades are done and in production! They will be available for purchase in the coming weeks (we will not be doing a preorder),\" a caption said. Even better, they're all vegan! Each shade is matte, but two are metallic. You can choose from sparkling pale pink, metallic yellow gold, matte cool greige, and a classic red. We can't wait to hear what inspired these hues.\nKeep reading to see more shots of the new products, then stay tuned! We'll be sharing updates as they become available.\nRelated:\nThis Dreamy Makeup Brush Looks Just Like the \"Enchanted Rose\" From Beauty and the Beast\nPrevious Next", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:50:34.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
