Welcome improvements include more apps, new smart home capabilities from Google Assistant and a better game controller. And now there's even a remote in the box. \nPricing hasn't changed though: the basic Shield with 16GB of onboard storage is $200 and the Shield Pro with 500GB storage is $300. \nI got a full hands-on demo of the new device and software today. Here's what I learned. Sarah Tew/CNET App upgrades: Amazon Video and 360 YouTube \nOne of my biggest complaints about Shield has finally been addressed: there's now an app for Amazon video. It's the latest interface, just like the one found on Roku's new 4K boxes and many Smart TVs , and offers full access to Amazon's vast library of content, including Prime video, a la carte movies and TV shows, and 4K and HDR content (when connected to a compatible TV). \nNow the sole major streaming platform that doesn't have Amazon -- the second-most popular service after Netflix -- is Apple TV . \nThe Shield YouTube app will now work with 360 video. While other devices will also handle YouTube's 360 video, which lets you pan around to get different views of the action, Shield's game controller makes it more natural. I found it much easier to scan around using its thumbsticks than it would be using a standard remote controller. \nSince it launched Shield has added just about every other major app, it often gets the latest and best interfaces, and of course you can cast compatible apps from your phone. Netflix and Amazon offer 4K and HDR at launch, while Google Play Movies and TV and Vudu will have 4K. Nvidia reps told me that when Vudu launches HDR10 support (expected later this year) the Shield will also support its HDR. Shield doesn't handle Dolby Vision , however. Sarah Tew/CNET Smaller box and controller, better gaming \nThe new Shield box has the exact same powerful processing and graphics as the original but is 40 percent smaller. It has all of the same connections (HDMI, two USB) except there's no longer an SD card slot. If you want extra storage you'll have to use USB or a NAS, or buy the 500GB Pro model. \nOn the original Shield the remote control was a $50 option, used a rechargeable battery, and lacked infrared so it couldn't control TV volume directly. The updated one can; it relies on a coin cell battery that lasts a year, and best of all, is now included in the box along with the game controller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T04:11:02.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
