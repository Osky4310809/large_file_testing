Rarely dropping sets to other New England players, he won the New England Invitational, GUTS 4 and nearly every local he entered. His performance on the national level is nothing to scoff at either — with wins over players like The Moon, Zain, dizzkidboogie, Bladewise and Ken, Crush is primed for an even better 2017. \nWritten by: Anokh Palakurthi Rank 48: Ryan Ford © Matt Seal/JuggleGuy \nRating: 6.484 SSBMRank 2015: 51 Other placements: 1st: DreamHack Montreal 2016, 9th: Canada Cup 2016, 17th: EGLX, 1st: Frozen Phoenix, 2nd: LAN WAR X \nAs one of Canada’s veterans, Ryan Ford ’s sturdy style of organized combat contrasts sharply with many new-age Foxes. Nevertheless, his flexible roster and penchant for disciplined play continue to stand the test of time, having granted him wins over Zhu, dizzkidboogie, KJH, DruggedFox and n0ne this year. \nWritten by: David Macdonald Rank 47: Infinite Numbers © Matt Seal/JuggleGuy \nRating: 6.560 Other Placements: 5th: New England Invitational, 2nd: Mega Mass Madness \nOne of the fastest rising stars of 2016, Jason \"Infinite Numbers\" Gauthier exploded onto the national scene at Pound 2016, defeating DJ Nintendo, Alex19, MacD and Mike Haze to secure ninth place. He later finished a respectable Top 48 at Shine 2016, Evo 2016, and The Big House 6. Ranked No. 1 in New Hampshire and No. 4 in all of New England, Infinite Numbers also has wins over Laudandus, The Moon and Westballz, and shows great potential heading into 2017. \nWritten by: Michael Forde Rank 46: Connor © Thomas Tischio \nRating: 6.586 Other placements: 3rd: Super Smash Sundays 49, 4th: NorCal Loves Teams \nArguably the biggest voice in the MIOM conspiracy, Connor \"Connor\" Nguyen had a solid 2016. He performed well on a national level, placing 17th at Genesis 3, but he really shined at locals, where his wins over players like Mike Haze, The Moon and MacD propelled him to seventh on the SoCal Power Rankings. One half of the successful \"SSBM Tutorials\" team on YouTube, Connor continues to push not only his own game, but also the community’s. \nWritten by: Henry Fellner Rank 45: Captain Faceroll © Matt Seal/JuggleGuy \nRating: 6.607 SSBMRank 2015: N/A Other placements: 3rd: OUTFOXX'D, 5th: NorCal Loves Teams, 3rd: Rubicon 11, 2nd: SoCal Colosseum 1, 17th: Smash N' Splash \nGriffin \"Captain Faceroll\" Williams keeps improving, and he's already defeated several of last year's SSBMRank Top 20 in sets. Faceroll’s tank of a Sheik shows fortitude, an unmovable force skyrocketing through the ranks and refusing to stop for anyone. At the beginning of the year, he listed his three future goals: Get ranked at least 10th in SoCal, place in the SSBMRank Top 100 and become the best player in the world. After today, he’s two-thirds of the way there. \nWritten by: Hector Arzola Rank 44: Trifasia © Electric/The Hypest Team \nRating: 6.611 Other placements: 5th: B.E.A.S.T. 6, 5th: Eclipse 2, 5th: Heir 3, 7th: DreamHack Winter \nSpanish smasher and green Peach player Alvaro “Trifasia” Garcia Moral, currently ranked sixth in Europe, makes his debut on SSBMRank this year. Highlights of his year included upset victories over MacD and Abate, along with multiple wins over Amsah and Zgetto. A relative newcomer to international play, Trifasia has seen great improvement from attending many larger events this year, and his 2017 promises more of the same. \nWritten by: Henry Fellner Rank 43: Santiago © Thomas Tischio \nRating: 6.617 Other placements: 1st: Zotsmash Biweekly 21, 4th: Super Smash Sundays 39, 2nd: UCl 24 \nSantiago \"Santiago\" Piñon is a strong Fox main from the powerhouse that is SoCal. Even though he wasn't very active this year, Santiago took out many of the SoCal greats including Westballz, Lucky, MacD and HugS, and placed eighth on the SoCal Spring Power Rankings. He's also well known for his Twitter, where he voices his outrageous opinions on the metagame including his belief that Falco is by far the best character in the game. \nWritten by: Henry Fellner Rank 42: Prince Abu © Thomas Tischio \nRating: 6.699 SSBMRank 2015: 55 Other placements: 9th: Smash N' Splash 2, 13th: WTFox 2, 7th: Canada Cup 2016, 2nd: Kings of the North V, 33rd: CEO 2016 \nKnown across the Melee community for being the go-to Jigglypuff practice partner, Abhishek \"Prince Abu\" Prabhu is often overlooked for his own skill. His 2016 was quiet but consistent; he showed that he's one of the best Jigglypuff mains in the world with Top 32 placings at EGLX 2016, GOML 2016, CEO 2016 and Shine 2016, all while farming wins over players like Professor Pro, Kels and n0ne. As Hax said, Prince Abu may just be the answer to stopping 666XX. \nWritten by: Mitchell Keller Rank 41: Gravy © Thomas Tischio \nRating: 6.788 Other placements: 4th: Battlegrounds 3, 7th: Frame One, 33rd: CEO 2016 \nBest known as one of the pioneers of the 20GX movement, Dustin \"Gravy\" White and his knowledge of frame data have greatly contributed to Captain Falcon's toolkit in the modern era of Smash. After an impressive 17th at Evo 2016, he took a short hiatus from Melee before returning to the game with a new character and a controversial new controller. Look for Gravy and his Smashbox-powered Fox at Genesis 4 in January. \nWritten by: Daniel Lee", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T04:42:26.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
