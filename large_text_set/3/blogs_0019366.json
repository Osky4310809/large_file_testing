Butler/Getty Images Tim Daniels   The Brooklyn Nets have reportedly set their sights on Detroit Pistons shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope , a potential restricted free agent, heading into the offseason. Brian Lewis of the New York Post reported Wednesday that Caldwell-Pope is one of the Nets' \"top targets,\" though their chances of landing him are unclear at this early stage. The 24-year-old Georgia product is averaging 14.2 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.1 three-pointers for the Pistons through 66 games so far this season. The organization originally selected him with the eighth overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft. Caldwell-Pope and Detroit failed to reach an agreement on a long-term extension before the Oct. 31 deadline, which made him eligible to become a restricted free agent this summer. The Nets can offer him a contract worth up to $103 million over four years, according to Lewis. The Pistons will have the opportunity to match any deal, though. In mid-January, Aaron McMann of MLive.com reported the guard will likely ask for \"upwards of $20 million a season\" in his next contract. That's a substantial raise from the nearly $3.7 million he's receiving for the 2016-17 season, per Spotrac . Vince Ellis of the Detroit Free Press passed along comments Caldwell-Pope made about his impending free agency, including the possibility of getting a max contract, in February: \nI see myself as what I'm worth. If they see me as a max player, then that's what I'm worth. If not, then I guess I'm not worth a max player. \nI gotta just go out and prove myself and just show like what I can do on the court, be a great teammate, give great energy each and every night and let them decide if I'm a max player or not. In a league predicated on star power, Caldwell-Pope has flashed enough upside over the last two seasons to believe he could become a key building block. As such, the Nets' interest is no surprise, but they'll likely have plenty of competition if the Pistons aren't prepared to offer KCP a lucrative deal.
