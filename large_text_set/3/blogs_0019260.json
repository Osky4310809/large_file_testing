(The following 10-minute video, of excerpts from the 51 hours, includes him being dragged into the room, his struggles to reach the food and his eventual death.) David L Moss Elliott Williams Cruel And Unusual Punishment Lawsuit Video by KRMGTulsa Mr. Williams, 37, was brought into jail and later charged with obstructing an officer after he had what one of his lawyers, Dan Smolen, termed “a nervous breakdown” because of events in his personal life. It was not clear how his neck was broken at some point after walking into the jail on Oct. 22. Officers subdued him to the ground in a holding cell, though he was seen on video able to move afterward. An inmate said he saw Mr. Williams ram his head into a wall while he was unattended by officers in an area with no video surveillance, according to a police investigation. \nAdvertisement Mr. Williams complained that he had broken his neck, but for 10 and a half hours he was left untreated in a holding cell, where he defecated himself, according to a police investigation. \n  He was placed on a gurney and taken to a medical unit, where a nurse said she thought he was faking and instructed him to “get up,” according to the investigation. A nurse and an officer removed his clothes and put him in a shower, where for at least 90 minutes he was unable to move, according to the investigation. He was sent back to the medical unit, where the medical staff believed he was suffering from “psychosomatic paralysis” and suggested that he be placed in the video-monitored cell. He was not seen by a doctor until Oct. 25, when he was dragged on a blanket into the cell. \n  There, as seen on the video footage, prison staff members tossed Styrofoam containers of food near Mr. Williams, but he was unable to feed himself. He twisted his arms to dab his fingers into the water, struggling to bring drops to his mouth. Throughout the video, his legs remain motionless.
