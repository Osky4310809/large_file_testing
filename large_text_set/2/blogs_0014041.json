The Special One spoke at his press conference after United’s 3-0 win over St. Etienne in the Europa League. Henrikh Mkhitaryan was absent from that victory and Mourinho explained that an illness kept him out of that fixture. \nThe Armenian has been a star for United since overcoming a rocky start to life at Old Trafford. He could miss Sunday’s fixture as could Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney. The veteran pair are suffering from muscular problems. Phil Jones could return to the squad to face his former club after recovering from a foot injury. Mourinho’s love of the FA Cup \nOne point Mourinho reiterated at his press conference was his love and respect for the FA Cup. He spoke with regret about playing a weakened team in the competition during his first season in England. Chelsea went out to Newcastle in the same week as wins in the League Cup final over Liverpool and Champions League against Barcelona: “I gambled too much, I focused too much on Barcelona and Liverpool. It was good because we beat Barcelona and we won the final against Liverpool, but the feeling I threw it away was not good, so I don’t throw it away. If I lose, I lose because the opponent was better or because we didn’t play well, but I’m not going to throw it away.” Winner Betting Odds", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:16:41.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
