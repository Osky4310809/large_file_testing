Advertisement \n“While the city has plenty of celebratory events up its sleeve, we want to hear from residents, businesses, and visitors . . . about your memories of Somerville,” officials said in a statement Monday. “All year long, we’ll collect stories, memories, photos, and anything else you want to share, and will display as many of them as we can during a year-end gala and ‘Storytelling Gallery.’ ” \nA designated page for the milestone has been set up on the city’s website, where longtime residents, or people who have merely passed through the city at some point, can upload images or vignettes about the community. They can also submit an idea for a program or historic material or ask a question about what’s to come, officials said. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Submissions are no longer being accepted, but officials are reviewing the proposals and plan to announce the winner soon. The logo will be used on promotional materials and displayed at various events. \nThe city’s archivist has been posting images of Somerville’s past online, along with a game called “Two Truths and a Lie,” where people are asked to determine which statements about former mayors are real. Advertisement \nA photo exhibit has also been set up at City Hall that displays “throwback” images of what the community once looked like. \nKacey Brister, a spokeswoman for the city, said in an e-mail that the next big event, a “Storytelling Series” at the library, kicks off on Feb. 2. \nThe event will include a presentation on how historians use oral history, along with traditional sources like letters and diaries, to tell a story. \n“We will have some type of event each month throughout 2017 and are working to finalize that schedule,” she said.
