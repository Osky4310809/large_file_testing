But there were people already in the villa. I was beside myself. It has broken me and Mat. \n“I even emailed the firm the day before to check everything was OK and was told it was.” \nOn the second day the firm sent the ­Cardiff family to one room in a budget hotel. \nOn ­Friday, when they still hadn’t got a villa, they contacted the Sunday Mirror. When we told Virgin ­Holidays of the family’s plight they offered them a villa.

Gemma said: “We looked on Trip Advisor and found many people double-booked.” \nIt now has emerged several British tourists have reported the firm to US police. Chris Beard, of Portsmouth, reported Disney And I – another villa firm linked to Kelly Price – after he found his place occupied by the owners. \nIt cost him £1,000 to stay elsewhere. Other fed-up Brits received correspondence from both firms, despite booking with one or the other. \nA Florida police spokesman said yesterday: “We are investigating allegations of fraud, involving Kissimmee properties.” \nThe Sunday Mirror tried to contact Price, Disney Area Villas and Disney and I but received no reply. It’s understood Saera’s £750 deposit is being refunded. \nNone of the firms have any links with the Walt Disney Co .
