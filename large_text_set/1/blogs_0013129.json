When recovering the ball at the beginning of the game we generated chances on goal. \nSecond string step up for Barca & Messi \n\"The defensive work has been wonderful. One of the best performances since I'm here. The reading [of the game] was excellent on a defensive level.\" \nLuis Enrique - whose side are now two points adrift of league leaders Real Madrid, having played two matches more - reserved particular praise for Vidal, who was making just his second La Liga appearance of the campaign. \n\"I believe that the team is strengthened to demonstrate that we need everyone,\" he added. \n\"A player like Aleix, the way he has trained in recent months, is ready to compete. He's played an excellent match. \nSuarez: We are calm on Messi \n\"He is the player who has played the fewest minutes with the exception of [third-choice goalkeeper] Jordi Masip.\" \nAndre Gomes was another player to impress against Las Palmas, with the Portugal international having one of his best games in a Barca shirt after initially struggling since joining from Valencia in the close-season. \nBarca confirm Messi renewal talks \n\"He is young and has everything to be a player in this team,\" Luis Enrique said. \n\"Maybe [against Las Palmas] he had more presence to make two goals, but it is a continuous process and his performance is in line with what we expected.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:55:56.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
