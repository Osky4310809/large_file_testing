PSU won its final nine games of the season, taking down Ohio State and Wisconsin along the way, and has scored 38 or more points in its last six games. The Trojans bounced back from an awful 1-3 start to win eight straight to close the season. They have scored 36 or more points in five of their last six games with the lone exception being a 26-13 road takedown of playoff semifinal loser Washington . Expect lots of points and tons of fun early Monday evening. \nIt all goes down at 5 p.m. ET live from the Rose Bowl. CBS Sports will be with you the entire way with score updates, highlights and commentary from the game.
