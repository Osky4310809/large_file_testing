Amber shared the big news on Instagram , introducing their new daughter to the masses, while also disclosing her name. We think. Maybe? This lil’ Tamblyn-Cross might have the most unique baby name ever…or the Tamblyn-Cross family is seriously messing with us.\nAs Amber wrote on Isntagram, their daughters new name is [deep breath]:\nDauphinoise Petunia Brittany Scheherazade Von Funkinstein Mustard Witch RBG Cross Tamblyn-Bey jr. Well that sure is…interesting.\nDavid and I are proud to announce the birth of our daughter, Dauphinoise Petunia Brittany Scheherazade Von Funkinstein Mustard Witch RBG Cross Tamblyn-Bey jr. #TheFutureIsFemale \nA post shared by Amber Tamblyn (@amberrosetamblyn) on Feb 21, 2017 at 11:45am PST \nWe’re willing to wager that this extensive baby name is not actually the name of their baby daughter. Maybe. IDK. Amber and David are like the epitome of a *cool* couple and they will be nothing short of *cool* parents, so if they want to give their baby 10+ names all strung together, we’re going to let them do it (also, really love the Ruth Bader Ginsburg shoutout, well done).\nHer real name might be hidden in this longer version — like maybe Daphne? Petunia? Brittany? Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Your guess is as good as ours, since Amber and David have not revealed the truth (they are proud new parents now, let’s give them some time). The Sisterhood has also not weighed in yet, so now…we wait.\nIn the meantime, welcome to the world Dauphinoise Petunia Brittany Scheherazade Von Funkinstein Mustard Witch RBG Cross Tamblyn-Bey jr.! The more we think about it, Mustard Witch actually is a pretty cool name.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:14:50.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
