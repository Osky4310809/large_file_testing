Martin Olsson has moved from Norwich to Swansea for £5m (Photo: Michael Regan/Getty) \nAnd the reasoning is very simple: the cost of relegation is actually higher than the rewards of being champions. \nThat is the plain truth of the wealth of the Premier League thanks to huge TV deals and match day revenues and it is why the struggling clubs will gamble big before the window shuts. \nSo far, we’ve seen wheeling and dealing with Crystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce spending a whacking £9m on Jeffrey Schlupp and doubling his wages to £60,000-a-week from what he was on at Leicester. \nSwansea boss Paul Lambert immediately spent big and one of his signings, Martin Olsson , cost £5m from Norwich . \nHull , Burnley , West Ham and Sunderland have also tried to be busy as they fight for survival while the bigger clubs clearly feel they are going well enough already. Chelsea's Nemanja Matic has been a January window success story (Photo: Shaun Botterill) \nIn the past, title chasers have spent big with Chelsea particularly good advocates of the January window as the signings of Nemanja Matic and David Luiz good examples. \nArsenal even bought Jose Antonio Reyes in 2004 and he is often dismissed as a disaster who got homesick but you could argue his arrival in January 2004 gave them a turn boost to the title. \nBut now the big deals are done at the other end and football finance expert Anna Semens, Head of Analytics at HSE Cake, makes it very clear as to why. \nSemens said: “The transfer window so far has been relatively quiet in terms of big deals, but that’s not too surprising and it looks like spending will probably reach a similar level to this time last year overall. \n“While the top teams competing for the title tend to invest heavily in the summer window, January tends to see more action at the lower end, with clubs competing to avoid relegation. TV deals are worth millions more in the Premier League (Photo: Michael Steele) \n“Avoiding relegation is in many ways worth more than actually winning the league, with Premier League status worth around £100m to a club with guaranteed TV revenue as well as a higher level of sponsorship fees - a shirt sponsorship deal for the bottom Premier League clubs could be as much as ten times that of Championship clubs. \n“This window in particular seems to have been characterised by a redistribution of power between players, clubs and agents with rumours of big money moves to China (and elsewhere) testing the resolve of clubs to hold on to their best players. \n“This influx of spending from a new market can create more options for players and in the short term at least, is likely to push up wages of the very best players that clubs don’t want to lose.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:22:22.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
