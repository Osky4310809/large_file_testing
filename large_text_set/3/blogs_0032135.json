Black Praises Trump Admin’s ‘Bold’ Step on Sanctuary Cities, but Congress Not ‘Off the Hook’ Share Share Tweet \nRep Diane Black (R-TN) praised the Trump administration’s recent move to pull billions in funding from sanctuary cities if they remain in noncompliance with immigration laws. Black told Townhall in a statement Tuesday that the actions “are a bold first step towards finally holding these rogue localities accountable.” \nHowever, Black is calling on Congress to take action to defund sanctuary cities as well. \n“I wholeheartedly support their efforts,” she said, “but this doesn’t get Congress off the hook for doing its job as well.” \nRep. Black emphasized that “Common sense and public safety demand that Congress immediately pass meaningful legislation of its own to permanently defund sanctuary cities once and for all.” \n“What can be enacted by administrative action can just as easily be dismantled the same way,” she warned. “What’s more, we know that activist courts will try to put this well-founded directive in legal limbo for as long as they can.” \nBlack is calling on Congress to pass the Stop Dangerous Cities Act , which would “withhold key federal funding streams” from cities that don’t allow law enforcement officers to cooperate with federal immigration officials. \nThe legislation was re-introduced in the House by Rep. Black in January along with companion legislation introduced by Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) in the Senate. \nThe bill would give the Trump administration’s actions against sanctuary cities permanency in law and includes new legal protections from liability for local law enforcement officers who comply with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detainers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:24:44.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
