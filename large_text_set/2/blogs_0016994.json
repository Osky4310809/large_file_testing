The rocket carried a payload of eleven satellites owned by Orbcomm, a New Jersey-based communications company. The first stage returned to land following launch. REUTERS/Joe Skipper This Spectacular Footage Shows SpaceX Landing A Rocket [VIDEO] 5493313 \nSpaceX released drone footage of its flawless rocket landing Saturday, and it’s absolutely stunning. \nThe two-stage Falcon 9 rocket was returning to Earth after putting into space a capsule carrying 5,000 pounds of supplies and scientific equipment to the International Space Station (ISS). The rocket touched down Saturday at SpaceX’s Landing Zone 1 in Cape Canaveral, Fla. \nThe rocket’s capsule will dock with the ISS Wednesday. \nWATCH: \nThis was SpaceX’s second successful launch and landing since a September 2016 explosion destroyed one of its rockets on the launch pad . SpaceX’s business rivals at the defense contractor United Launch Alliance predicted it could take SpaceX up to a year to return to outer space after the explosion. \nSpaceX officials claim the explosion was caused by broken carbon fibers that caused cold oxygen to catch fire and explode. Basically, SpaceX used a risky fueling process that can result in an explosion if the weather is warmer than expected. \nNASA’s Space Station Advisory Committee has serious concerns about the company’s safety standards however, and suggested that SpaceX review its policies even before the explosion. \nSpaceX rockets have previously exploded several times during landing attempts, which Musk called a “huge blow.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:41:57.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
