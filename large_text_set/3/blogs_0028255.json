In a city overrun with overpriced omakase offerings and overindulgent tasting menus, Semilla was a rare bastion of relative affordability and restraint. The price of the ten-course menu is $97. When it opened, it was $75.\nThe restaurant was born out of the roving pop-up dinners that chef-owners Pam Yung and Jose Ramirez-Ruis used to host. But the couple split last year and Yung left Semilla. \nRamirez-Ruis said his decision to close the restaurant was “very personal,” — not related to rent, food costs, or business at the restaurant. “I don’t have any future plans. I just needed time away from the restaurant to recharge and regroup,” he said. “It’s important. . . .to allow yourself some time to breath and grow. This is the year for me.”\nRamirez-Ruis said business did not drop off drastically after Yung left — she was responsible for Semilla’s acclaimed breads and desserts — but he admitted that both January and February were “tough.”\nThe chef first announced the shuttering on Instagram. \n“Semilla has been a dream come true for me, and I want to thank everyone who helped make it possible - from our staff, to good friends, to our regulars and guests who gave us reason to open every day. After building something so beautiful, I have made the hard choice to move on to the next chapter. I am not leaving with any particular plan in mind - simply to recharge and recuperate. While I did make the decision that my time at Semilla was nearing an end, I am saddened by the choice to close the doors so quickly, and regret not being able to offer more of a chance for you to come visit us one last time. It has been such an honor to cook for you, and I cannot wait to do so again .\"\nThis critic awarded four-stars to Semilla less than a year after it opened, calling it New York’s “next great restaurant.” Of the cabbage skin and slaw sandwich I wrote: “Never has a piece of bluefin tuna infected my culinary daydreams to such a degree as this sandwich, which is, for lack of a better term, a humble piece of food waste.”\nLater that year, Eater’s Bill Addison named Semilla one of the country’s 21 best new restaurants , and the famously-stingy Michelin inspectors awarded a coveted star : rare for a debut venue. \nIt’s been a sad winter for lovers of small, innovative, fair-priced, tasting-menu spots in Brooklyn. Earlier this month, the Michelin-starred Take Root, one of the city’s toughest tables, closed as well . It charged $120 and employed just two people: owners Elise Kornack and Anna Hieronimus. Semilla has five employees. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:08:43.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
