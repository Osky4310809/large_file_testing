He died from his injuries days later. \nThe stub is up for auction and at the time of publication only has two bidders, the highest being $8,500. A copy of Cathy Scott’s The Killing of Tupac Shakur book detailing the fateful night is included in the auction lot with the ticket. \nAfter Mike Tyson hit his first round KO, ‘Pac allegedly handed his ticket stub, with his section FLR4 Row E Seat 2 printed on it, to a man and said, “Here you go boy, enjoy this,” TMZ reports. \nSomeone else ended up buying it and is now looking to auction the piece of history off through Goldin Auctions . \nMaybe Martin Shkreli will cop it since he’s into collecting Hip Hop mementos, the latest being the highly anticipated project from Lil Wayne, Tha Carter V . \nThese days, Mike Tyson is done with his own boxing career and is now reportedly training Chris Brown for his fight against Soulja Boy. \nCheck out Tupac’s ticket stub from the Mike Tyson fight in Vegas below.
