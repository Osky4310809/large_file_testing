According to Deadline , Netflix is “in talks” to pick up the project, with Rich Wilkes and Californication creator Tom Kapinos writing the script and Jackass’ Jeff Tremaine directing. \nThe movie will be titled Dirt , and as a Motley Crüe biopic, it will follow the story of the band’s life through all of the crazy ups and horrifying downs—from deadly car crashes and heroin overdoses, to dramatic falling-outs between band members. The Deadline story doesn’t have any casting information, but it should be fun to see who they find to star in this. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T09:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:58:39.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
