Culleoka Unit School student Elizabeth Thomas, who was last seen March 13, is believed to be with her former teacher.\nTennessee Bureau of Investigation officials said Tuesday that Cummins researched teen marriage online eight days before he abducted 15-year-old Thomas. He also searched whether his car had particular features that “could be tracked by law enforcement,” ABC News reported .\nJason Whatley, a lawyer for Thomas’ family, also said Tuesday that the school had been investigating a report that a student saw the pair kiss before they went missing. Cummins and Thomas denied the kiss, but the teacher said she was “a really good friend,” according to the school’s report.\nCummins was eventually suspended over the allegation until he was formally fired the day after he and Thomas disappeared.\n“My client’s position, respectfully, is that Mr. Cummins should have been out the door until the police investigation was completed,” Whatley said.\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has issued an Amber Alert for Thomas. She was last seen around 7:30 a.m. on March 13 at a restaurant in Columbia, Tennessee.\n“We need you home,” Thomas’s sister, Sarah, told ABC News. “Whatever he’s telling you is a lie… just call or text us whenever you can.”\nAMBER ALERT: Here are new pictures of suspect Tad Cummins, captured the week prior to the kidnapping of Elizabeth Thomas.
