By Richard Tanner PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED:   \nJust 48 hours before the EFL Cup final, the Manchester United manager wore the initials “CR” on his top in his press conference yesterday in support of Claudio Ranieri , before launching his scathing attack on the Foxes squad, many of who signed lucrative new contracts after lifting the Premier League championship last season. \nJose Mourinho was sacked by Chelsea in similar circumstances last season amid reports of a players’ revolt but said his experience was “peanuts” compared to Leicester’s treatment of the man who led them to the most unexpected title in football history last season. \nHe said: “Probably the season started with the typical selfishness of others, people thinking about new contracts, people thinking about more money, people thinking about leaving and forgetting who helped them to reach a certain level. \n“This is not just football, it’s a bit of our world.
