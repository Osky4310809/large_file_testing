A letter written by her attorneys states that the pictures were “wrongfully obtained” and leaked to the site and requests that they be removed at once. \nShe wasn’t the only one affected by this recent hack; it seems that “private” photos of Emma Watson were also leaked, though hers are not nudes. “Photos from a clothes fitting Emma had with a stylist a couple of years ago have been stolen. They are not nude photographs,” reads a statement from Watson’s spokesperson, as per the Telegraph. \nAdvertisement \n\nThe photos of Watson reportedly ended up on both Reddit and 4chan and the Telegraph reports that the original poster of the photos alluded to the fact that there could be more photos of other celebrities coming in the future.\nFrom the Telegraph: \n“There may be a few more names added to that list but these are the big two.\n“Don’t want to break any Reddit rules so no links right now but there should be some really good drama over the next few days.”\n“Really good drama” is one way to describe it, but you could also just call it an egregious and gross invasion of privacy. That works just as well and is much more accurate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:37:48.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
