Comment IMAGE Cosmopolitan \nButt plug is not just perfect insult from the '80s, it’s also an anal sex toy shaped like a teardrop. As the name suggests, it’s meant to be placed, or “plugged,” into your butt(hole). The base of a butt plug is specifically designed to be wide so it doesn’t get sucked into and “lost” in your rectum. Now that’s an embarrassing trip to the ER. HOW TO: According to Tristan Taormino , a sex educator and author of The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women , “[A butt plug] is designed to go in your ass and stay there. If you like in-and-out penetration, then you want a dildo.” (It's also worth trying a strap-on, which is a dildo with a harness that you wear around your waist, so the sex toy doesn’t get lost in there.) She says that people experience pleasure in the butt differently—some like a feeling of fullness there, which is what a butt plug accomplishes. When inserting a butt plug into yourself or your partner, always go slow, and ask questions to see if the speed and sensation is doing it for them. Lubing it up isn’t a bad idea either, since butt holes don’t lubricate themselves naturally the way vaginas do. Taormino also explains that some of the nerve endings in the rectum respond to pressure rather than massage. Butt plugs can be used as a “warm-up” for other sorts of anal play like using dildos, larger toys, anal intercourse, or they can be left in while you perform other sex acts. Start out with a smaller plug and work your way up. The Healthy Bear , a gay sex education website, recommends using butt plugs made from silicone, vinyl, or rubber. According to the Healthy Bear, “When buying any sort of anal toys it’s best to avoid cheaper toys as they can be made of low grade materials including petroleum products that can burn the lining of the anal canal.” High-grade silicone is the way to go here.
