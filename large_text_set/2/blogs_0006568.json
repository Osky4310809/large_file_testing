(Photo: Rosie LaVon's Marketplace and Event Space) 23 CONNECT 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nKevin Bacon would not stand for this. \nA businesswoman in the tiny city of Henryetta, Oklahoma, canceled a planned Valentine's Day dance after someone unearthed an old city ordinance that bans dancing within 500 feet of a church or school. It's a predicament reminiscent of the 1984 classic Footloose . \nThe city of about 6,000 people just south of Tulsa has had the law on the books for years. The Henryetta Code Book is pretty clear: \"No public dance hall shall be permitted where the same is located within 500 feet of any church or public school.\" \nSounds just like Rev. Moore. \nBut Henryetta Police Chief Steve Norman said his department hasn't and won't enforce the ordinance, which he called an old law that has \"never been addressed.\" \n\"We've had dances in Henryetta for years,\" he said. \"(The ordinance) pops its head up every few years and people try to make a big deal of it.\" Kevin Bacon schools Millennials on '80s awareness \nThe measure most recently reared its head this week after Joni Insabella decided she'd host a Valentine's Day dance for adults at her business, Rosie LaVon's Marketplace and Event Center. The space is located about 250 feet from a church. Insabella, who launched the business last year, said she wanted to provide a night for residents to spend with their sweethearts. She hired lights and a DJ. \n\"We're just some dancing rebels down here,\" she said. \"It was just going to be a real fun evening.\" \nBut once word spread, there was a complaint she was violating the city's ordinance. The complaint suggested Insabella was getting special treatment because her husband is the city attorney. \n\"It just started a terrible firestorm,\" Insabella said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:34:40.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
