Breaking: Ninth Circuit refuses to lift order blocking Trump travel ban…link to opinion https://t.co/dz8O6JKJwm pic.twitter.com/75xp7RKcRK \n— Jacob Gershman (@jacobgershman) February 9, 2017 The case, State of Washington v. Trump , was decided by a three-judge panel. It was heard after the Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to lift the temporary suspension of Trump’s executive order, which bars people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Thursday’s ruling means that, for now, the ban is still suspended. The three judges appeared to have rejected virtually all of the federal government’s arguments in its decision. Govt: courts cannot meaningfully review executive orders. \nNinth Circuit: this is what democracy looks like. pic.twitter.com/6Inahxt9gF \n— Matthew Segal (@segalmr) February 9, 2017 Ninth Circuit also declines to limit the TRO's scope. pic.twitter.com/CyVLLgJFMM \n— Matt Ford (@fordm) February 9, 2017 The weakness of the Fed's case was not lost on the 9th Cir. pic.twitter.com/8RMPuJLzor \n— Katherine Franke (@ProfKFranke) February 9, 2017 Court is scornful & dismissive of Trump DOJ's claim that ban necessary for security: \"no evidence\" for that at all https://t.co/VTPZKQE0RZ pic.twitter.com/S1V5KInmtq \n— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) February 9, 2017 THIS IS BIG: 9th Circuit judges say Donald Trump's sweeping talk of a \"Muslim ban\" can be used as evidence for discrimination. pic.twitter.com/08vXUIQiN9 \n— Terry Moran (@TerryMoran) February 9, 2017 The next likely stop for the case is the Supreme Court, which is currently evenly split between four liberal and four conservative justices. A 4-4 tie would leave the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in place. Trump responded with typical understatement. SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! \n— Donald J.
