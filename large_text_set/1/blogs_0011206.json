And considering that Snowden is living today in the care of Vladimir Putin’s Russia, it’s a good chance the United States’ main opponents on the world stage are enjoying going to be enjoying the fruits of his espionage for a long time to come. \nBut that horse has left the barn. The issue now, on the cusp of the Trump presidency, is how American intelligence agencies that bet heavily on a Hillary Clinton victory in the November election are prepared to serve the incoming administration. \nAnd according to Greenwald, the answer is a dismal, dismal no. \nIn a lengthy article for The Intercept, Greenwald wrote that the publication of “revelations” about Trump contained in a phony dossier cooked up by a spy employed by Trump’s political opponents are just the latest, most spectacular attack in a fight that’s going to be going on for a long time to come. \nAnd there’s no question which side the mainstream media is taking. \nAs Greenwald wrote: \nAlmost immediately after it was published, the farcical nature of the “dossier” manifested. Not only was its author anonymous, but he was paid by Democrats (and, before that, by Trump’s GOP adversaries) to dig up dirt on Trump. Worse, he himself cited no evidence of any kind but instead relied on a string of other anonymous people in Russia he claims told him these things. Worse still, the document was filled with amateur errors … \nNone of this stopped Democratic operatives and prominent media figures from treating these totally unverified and unvetted allegations as grave revelations. \nGreenwald’s whole piece is lengthy, but it’s well worth the read — all the more so because he’s no fan of Donald Trump as the president. \nAnd the point is one every American – liberal and conservative – should be taking to heart for the foreseeable future. \nThe election of Donald Trump threw a huge monkey wrench into the machinery of Washington power – from the suddenly impotent Democrat Party to the behind the scenes “factions” of unelected intelligence chiefs who were rooting for a Hillary Clinton win. \n(Remember, it was Michael Morell, a former CIA director and vociferous Trump critic who took to the pages of the Democrat-friendly New York Times calling Trump “unqualified” for the job of president.) \nOnce he’s sworn in, there’s no reason to think those “factions” won’t be doing everything they can to constrain the new president – whether out of an honest, deep-seated conviction that Trump positions are mistaken, or for less noble reasons. \nRegardless, a president being attacked by “open warfare” from his own intelligence agencies is going to have to step very carefully when it comes to trusting the information those agencies provide. \nAfter the bull-in-a-china-shop Trump campaign against domestic political opponents, Americans had to expect conflict in a Trump administration with other world powers. And after eight years of Obama Era appeasement to the murderous mullahs of Tehran and Kremlin strongman Vladimir Putin, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. \nBut a White House-intelligence agency war was one most Americans couldn’t have expected.
