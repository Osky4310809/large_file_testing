Gary Stevens/Flickr\nIf there's one thing to learn from watching the \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" movies, it's that the Greeks like food. A lot.\nBut Greek cuisine doesn't end with gyro and Fage yogurt . Greek culture has some of the world's most delicious food, from hearty slow-cooked meat dishes to syrupy, rose-flavored cakes for dessert.\nI tapped into my Greek-Cypriot heritage — and asked my friends and family for their favorite dishes — to put together a list of Greek foods you should try.\nAs my yiayia would say, \"Kopiaste!\" (\"Come and sit, eat!\")\nView As: One Page Slides Papoutsakia carpaumar/iStock Papoutsakia, which translates to \"little shoes,\" are eggplants stuffed with meat cooked in a tomato sauce and covered in bechamel sauce.\nPastitsio blackboard1965/iStock This baked pasta dish — also called macaronia tou fournou — is similar to lasagna. It's made with layers of macaroni, minced pork (or beef) in a tomato sauce seasoned with mint and cinnamon, and topped with creamy bechamel and cheese. It's perfect on its own or paired with salad.\nTaramosalata Robert Kindermann/Wikimedia Commons This fish roe dip, blended with olive oil and either potato or bread, brings a burst of color to the table. It's heavenly spread on pita bread — and though it's high in fat, it's rich in protein and Omega-3 .\nAvgolemono soup Elzbieta Sekowska/Shutterstock This silky chicken broth soup made with whisked eggs, lemon juice, and rice is the best thing to eat during the winter and an excellent cold remedy. Top with shredded chicken and pepper for added flavor.\nHalloumi Stuart Webster/Flickr Made in Cyprus, halloumi is a mild cheese with a slightly salty flavor made with sheep's and goat's milk. It's a versatile cheese that can be eaten on its own, in salads, sandwiches, and even with watermelon. And unlike many other cheeses, it remains intact when grilled, baked, or pan-fried.\nKleftiko Alizada Studios/Shutterstock This slow-cooked lamb dish is typically seasoned with garlic, onion, and oregano, and served over potatoes and vegetables. If it's marinated for long enough and cooked correctly, the meat will easily come apart with a fork, and virtually melt in your mouth.\nKoulouri Nikola Obradovic/Shutterstock No Greek table is set without a basket of koulouri — a sesame-coated bread that's usually baked in a ring shape, and is crunchy on the outside and doughy on the inside. The bread — which can also come with olives or feta inside — is best when still warm.\nKoulourakia Lydia Vero/Shutterstock While these sound similar in their name to koulouri bread, koulourakia are slightly different. These buttery, plait-shaped cookies are smaller, sweeter (there's added sugar), and either crispy or soft inside. And though they are scrumptious year-round, they're traditionally served over Easter.\nGalaktoboureko Jazz Guy/Flickr For dessert, try a slice of this syrupy semolina custard pie, which has a delicate rosewater flavor and a filo pastry shell.\nSpanakopita KarpenkovDenis/iStock Not all Greek pastries are sweet — this delectable savory pie is made up of a spinach and feta mixture sandwiched between sheets of crisp filo pastry.\nKeftedes Fanfo/Shutterstock These crispy fried Greek meatballs are usually made with pork or beef, and seasoned with oregano, onion, garlic, and a pinch of cinnamon.\nTzatziki Klearchos Kapoutsis/Flickr A popular dip on the meze table, tzatziki is made with plain yogurt, mint, cucumber, olive oil, and garlic. It's equally good slathered onto grilled pork or chicken skewers, or scooped up with pita.\nSheftalia Leonid Mamchenkov/Flickr These succulent lamb and pork sausages are a Cypriot specialty. No family barbecue is complete without one.\nKalo Prama ALLEKO/iStock When you try it, you'll understand why kalo prama (which literally translates to \"good thing\") got its name. This fluffy, syrupy semolina cake made with rosewater and almonds makes for a light, sweet dessert.\nKritharaki Dar1930/Shutterstock Made with orzo, tomatoes, and onion, this filling pasta dish can be made on its own or with most kinds of meat — lamb, pork, beef, or chicken all pack extra flavor.\nGemista blackboard1965/iStock Gemista — peppers and tomatoes stuffed with rice, herbs, and, if you like, ground meat — make a satisfying and healthy main or side dish.\nSouvlakia Karl Baron/Flickr Most people know what a gyro is, but have never heard of souvlakia — grilled skewers of meat, usually pork or chicken, cut into chunks and either tucked into a pita with salad or eaten straight off the stick.\nDolmades Geoff Peters/Flickr These hand-rolled parcels of ground pork, rice, and parsley wrapped in vine leaves are somewhat fussy to make, but they're just as good served hot or cold. You can also substitute the meat for peppers for a vegetarian option.\nLoukoumades Gary Stevens/Flickr If you're a fan of doughnuts, then you'll love loukoumades. A popular dessert to pick up on the go, these fried dough balls come served in syrup and with a variety of toppings like nuts and cinnamon.\nAfelia Fanfo/Shutterstock This Cypriot dish of pork marinated in red wine can take hours to make, but the long prep time is worth it for the incredible flavor.\nKourabiedes Bill Anastasiou/Shutterstock Over the holidays, most Greek grandmothers keep these festive walnut and powdered sugar cookies — flavored with a pinch of orange and vanilla — handy for guests. Try one with a cup of Greek coffee \"sketo\" (\"plain,\" without milk) to balance the sweetness.\nMavromatika Paul Cowan/Shutterstock One of the healthier foods on this list, mavromatica is a protein-packed black-eyed bean dish cooked with a tomato sauce.\nMoussaka jules/Flickr Layers of ground meat (usually lamb or beef) cooked in a tomato sauce, eggplant, and bechamel sauce make up this Greek staple.\nLoukaniko Fanfo/Shutterstock Loukaniko is a smoked sausage with an often spicy flavor, infused with fennel, orange, and sometimes chili. It makes a great starter when hot off the barbecue and paired with halloumi in a pita sandwich.\nBaklava Catherine Sharman/Flickr While baklava is also popular in Turkey and the Middle East, it can be found in every Greek patisserie. The pistachio, filo pastry-wrapped treats are typically cut into squares or triangles, and made with honey, lemon juice, and cinnamon.\nRead the original article on INSIDER .
