He knows a lot more from the experience than many of us. \n“Rotational presidency is a Nigerian phenomenon and it is particularly Nigerian. \n“We have seen our heterogeneous composition and we have realised that since power is owned by component groups, to create peace for development, to create inclusiveness, it must be rotated. \n“There is no state in Nigeria, local government or community where rotation is not going on and power not being rotated. So this is the right thing for Nigeria and Obj is clearly right. \n“Also, IBB is also agreeing with that, that he would support Igbos. So, it is very clear that this is the right thing to do and this is what we should do,” Onovo said. \nAccording to him, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) when it was founded in 1999 realised the need for rotation of the presidency in order to ensure peace. \nThe former presidential candidate expressed strong belief that the South East region would overcome the challenges of marginalisation with a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction. \n“Domination cannot be positive in politics, politics is representative, so the South East must be adequately represented in politics of Nigeria otherwise it will become counterproductive for the nation. \n“And that is what Chief Obasanjo and Babangida realised and promoting right now. That is the right thing to do, the Imo born politician stressed. \nHe said that every patriotic Nigerian must support the call in the interest of the nation. \nObasanjo while hosting the Christian Association of Nigeria, Ogun Chapter on Tuesday said that the region, in 57 years of independence of the country, had not produced a democratically-elected president. \nObasanjo said that the problem of marginalisation and injustice had been major source of conflicts in the country. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T13:35:29.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
