Trevor Mann, CEO of Mitsubishi, said this is one way to create synergies between the Alliance and its newest member . \n“Renault is almost non-existent in Southeast Asia. If it made sense for Mitsubishi to cross badge a Renault product in Southeast Asia that could be an interesting discussion,” he said. \nThis isn’t the first time such a move has been suggested either. Back in 2013, Mitsubishi and the then Renault-Nissan Alliance announced a joint intention to explore several projects involving shared products, technology and manufacturing capacity. Mitsubishi and Nissan are also part of a joint venture company (NMKV), which handles product planning and engineering for Kei cars for the Japanese domestic market (JDM). \nCompared to Nissan, Mitsubishi has a stronger presence in the region, with three factories in Thailand having produced more than three million vehicles. By pooling its resources together (either by rebadging or sharing technologies), Mitsubishi could assist its partners such as Nissan and Renault to increase its market share and profits. \nIt was reported earlier that Mitsubishi and Nissan are currently considering a joint development of pick-up trucks , where Mitsubishi will prepare the platforms rather than Nissan. “If you look at our cost performance in that region, we are the benchmark within the alliance. Our cost-base on pickups is better than Nissan’s,” Mann explained.
