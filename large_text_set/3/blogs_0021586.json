This is a gangbuster free update , with the addition of the ability to shoot in LOG mode getting the most attention, and for good reason. You can now shoot b-roll or steal shots on your phone that could be credibly cut in with your A-Cam footage. However, remember that you're still encoding to 8-bit H.264 and using a small sensor. \nThe update also includes some other notable new features. This version adds zebra stripes, focus peaking (accurate on a per pixel level), false color, a waveform and automated focus pulling. They've also added manual arc sliders for focus, ISO and shutter speed making it easier to dial these settings in accurately. Automated Focus Pull Credit: FiLMiC Inc. \nFor an additional $9.99, there is the Cinematographer Kit in-app purchase that adds powerful features like Temporal Noise Reduction and gamma curve presets. Reading the documentation, it is clear that the company has a clear road map and that they are making intelligent choices. For example, the TNR composites three exposures, only working on static parts of the frame, ignoring high noise areas and leaving them for you to deal with in post using spatial noise reduction (generally you want to do TNR before SNR). The kit requires an iPhone 7/7Plus for hardware. Gamma curves Credit: FiLMiC Inc. \nThe gamma presets available are: Natural (rec. 709), Dynamic (higher contrast, higher saturation rec. 709), Flat (what we're used to shooting on DSLR's) and LOG. For LOG, the app works with data from the sensor and applies 10-bit math to it prior to encoding. The bottom line is that you should get an extra stop of exposure without altering the blackpoint/whitepoint. It also means a more complicated post-production pipeline, experimentation on how it works in this implementation, and probably supplemental battery power to feed all this processing. Temporal Noise Reduction Credit: FiLMiC Inc. \nOverall, this is an exciting update for filmmakers, particularly with the LOG shooting. Our guts tell us that there are going to be times that you'll want to shoot flat rather than LOG, depending on conditions. As with any new technology, experimentation (and luck) will yield the best results. Anyone out there have any insights, or footage to share? Let's throw some interesting footage into Resolve and push the pixels around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:24:34.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
