The video contained a plethora of celebrities from all areas of the entertainment world, some from the LGBT community and some not. One thing that they all had in common was an overwhelming sense of gratitude for President Obama. One of Obama’s greatest accomplishments while in office was helping to get same-sex marriage legalized, which occurred on June 26, 2015, when the Supreme Court ruled that state-level bans on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. Jesse Tyler Ferguson of Modern Family , comedians Lily Tomlin and Tig Notaro, Lance Bass, and Ellen DeGeneres’s own wife, Portia de Rossi, all thanked Obama for the opportunity to marry the person they love. On the same day same-sex marriage became legal, so did the right for same-sex couples to adopt children. Neil Patrick Harris appeared with his husband and two children to thank Obama for their ability to bring a family together. Some of the non-LGBT celebrities who thanked Obama included Debra Messing, Drew Barrymore, and rapper Macklemore. Macklemore had a specific reason to thank Obama: “For fighting for a world where I can raise my daughter to love whoever she wants to love.” The video came to an end with several people saying a very heartfelt, and sometimes tearful, thank you.
