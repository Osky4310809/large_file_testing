Blocking your cervix with crocodile poop View this image › \nRyo_stockphoto / Via gettyimages.com Way back in 1850 BCE , Egyptian women would take crocodile dung and insert it up near the cervix before sex to block sperm from entering. They’d usually mix it with honey because it was known for it’s antibacterial properties and it helped the dung stick up near the cervix. \nWhile we aren’t sure how effective this method was, the fact that it was documented well enough to survive in historical records for thousands of years suggests that it probably did an okay job — or at least it was pretty popular. That being said, shoving crocodile poop up your vagina before sex sounds to us like fifty shades of infection.\nID: 10714717 2. Inserting honey “tampons” View this image › \nMarcelc / Via gettyimages.com Ancient Egyptian women were also using some of the earliest barrier methods: vaginal suppositories made out of honey. These were described around 1550 BCE in Ebers Papyrus , one of the oldest medical texts in the world. \nWomen were told to make a mixture of honey and acacia leaves, which they would smear inside the vaginal canal to act as a spermicide or make into a bundle with wool and lint (like an ancient tampon) to place up near the cervix. Unlike the dung method, at least this one probably smelled (and tasted) a lot more pleasant.\nID: 10722852 3. Lodging a piece of stone or bronze into your vagina View this image › \nWellcome Library / wellcomeimages.org / Via commons.wikimedia.org A pessary is essentially an object, device, or suppository inserted into the vagina to block the cervix or kill sperm. It’s similar to a diaphragm or cervical cap, but back in the Roman Empire around 200 BCE, they were made out of hard things like stone and bronze (like the pessary pictured above). \nThe Greek physician Dioscorides described pessaries in his legendary medical text Materia Medica and advised women to soak them in peppermint oil, which might have provided a numbing effect. Because, while the pessaries might have been effective, they were probably very painful for women during sex.\nID: 10731435 4. Downing some mercury after sex View this image › \nMarcelc / Via gettyimages.com It is believed that in Ancient China, prostitutes and concubines were advised to drink liquid mercury or take it in tablet form after sex to avoid getting pregnant, because it prevented ovulation. The effectiveness of mercury at preventing pregnancy is questionable, but we’re guessing it didn’t last very long as a popular contraceptive given the side effects of consuming metallic mercury: tremors, headache, kidney failure, death…\nID: 10722137 5. Squatting and sneezing the sperm out View this image › \nG-stockstudio / Via gettyimages.com The Ancient Roman gynecologist Soranus thought that women should take responsibility for the withdrawal method by doing the following: holding their breath when they believed their parter was ejaculating, then getting up immediately after intercourse to squat and sneeze repeatedly, then washing out their vagina. Because, sure.\nID: 10732234 6. Wrapping the penis in goat bladders View this image › \nBill_anastasiou / Getty Images / Via gettyimages.com Starting around 700 BCE, the ancient Romans would use bladders from goats, sheep, and other animals to wrap around the penis during sexual intercourse. Apparently, the Romans were invested in ideas of public health and created this method to “protect women” and prevent the transmission of venereal diseases like syphilis. \nAlthough these goat bladder condoms were originally intended for protection against venereal diseases, they ended up being a pretty effective contraceptive method and people used them well into the Medieval Period.\nID: 10721644 7. Smearing cedar oil and frankincense in the vagina View this image › \nDenira777 / Getty Images / Via gettyimages.com Although it sounds more like a potpourri or an air freshener, this natural ointment mixture was a popular contraception method around the 4th century in Ancient Greece . Women would smear a mixture of cedar oil, frankincense, and sometimes lead , into their vaginas and around their cervix to prevent pregnancy. It was believed that the oil mixture acted as a spermicide, and it was actually recommended by Aristotle in his early medical texts.\nID: 10721643 8. Putting little silk paper hats on penises View this image › \nThe Yorck Project / Via commons.wikimedia.org Around the 12th century, the Chinese were using something called a “glans condom,” an early predecessor to the first condom that basically only covers the head (glans) of the penis. \nPeople in China used their expertise in silk and paper-making to form silk paper sheaths, which were then soaked in oil for lubrication and spermicidal purposes. They were placed over the top of the penis during sex to catch the sperm and prevent it from entering the uterus. “These oiled paper cones could also act as a kind of a cervical cap,” Minkin says.\nID: 10721785 9. Just straight up putting a tortoise shell on your penis View this image › \nR0m0 / Via gettyimages.com Unlike other early condom-like methods from around the world, the method used in 13th century Japan was a little less… flexible. The Japanese prevented pregnancy using a hard sheath made out of tortoise shell , that was worn on the penis to keep the sperm from entering the woman’s uterus. This method definitely wins a gold star for contraception creativity, but… OUCH.\nID: 10721672 10. Securing linen condoms onto your penis with a little ribbon View this image › \nLund University Historical Museum / User:MatthiasKabel / Via commons.wikimedia.org The first person to actually describe the condom in the sense we know today was Italian anatomist Gabriele Falloppio in the late 14th century, who is best known for first describing the fallopian tubes (which are named after him). \nFalloppio came up with the idea to help prevent the spread of syphilis, which was still ravaging Europe. The condom was basically a sheath made of linen, which you would slip over the head of the penis and tie tightly around the base using a ribbon… like a little penis bonnet. Kind of cute, right?\nID: 10721889 11. Douching with vinegar View this image › \nPat_hastings / Via gettyimages.com Around the 16th century in Elizabethean England, women were advised to wash their genitals and douche using vinegar — like the same kind you clean with. \n“Women sometimes used other harsh astringents in the vagina before sex, because they believed it would kill sperm,” Minkin says. Vinegar-soaked sponges were apparently a popular option for Elizabethan prostitutes.\nID: 10731391 12. Shoving half a squeezed lemon in your vagina View this image › \nMichellegibson / Via gettyimages.com Imagine cutting a lemon in half and juicing it so the rind forms a little cap. Starting around the mid-17th century, women would insert this into their vagina before sex — the idea was that the rind would prevent sperm from entering the uterus through the cervix and the acidic juice would kill sperm, too. \n“The mechanism of the lemon cervical cap, blocking the cervix, is the same idea behind the modern rubber cervical cap invented in 1927, which is still used with spermicide as a contraception today,” Minkin says. \n“Casanova was actually known for using this method with his many lovers,” Minkin says. Giacomo Casanova wrote about using the partially squeezed lemon halves in his famous 18th century memoirs. Whether or not the lemon juice stings the shit out of your vag, well, that’s something we might want to leave behind in history.\nID: 10714718 13. Animal intestines Anastasios_papazachariou / Via gettyimages.com \nThe British Museum / CC / Via britishmuseum.org \n  Yes, animal intestines might sound disgusting — especially in a sexual context — but these were actually a predecessor to the modern condom, folks. It came into use around the Renaissance in Europe to curb venereal diseases and illegitimate children in the royal families. “Before the rubber revolution in the 19th century, people used intestines from fish or sheep to wrap around the penis and catch sperm,” Minkin says. \nWhile the idea of wrapping your peen in animal guts isn’t exactly sexy, the logic behind this method is what led to the creation of the condoms we still rely on for contraception in the 21st century. Plus, people do still use lambskin condoms today as a more natural, latex-free option (although they don’t protect against STIs).\nID: 10723185 So contraception has come a long, long way. View this image › \nFox It’s worth mentioning that many people in the US had to use alternative or outdated methods even up until the 1950s, because the use of modern contraception (like condoms, diaphragms, and pills) was a punishable crime. Actually, birth control was illegal in the US for nearly a century under the Comstock Act passed in 1873. \n“Birth control wasn’t officially legal until 1965 after the Supreme Court ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut, which made it unconstitutional for the government to prohibit married couples from using birth control,” Minkin says. So we’ve technically only had access to safe, effective birth control for about fifty years.\nID: 10732335 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:52:36.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
