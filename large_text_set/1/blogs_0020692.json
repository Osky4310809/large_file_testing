By Danielle Zickl   1:50 pm The Jamaican men's team wins the 2008 Olympic 4x100-meter relay, one of Usain Bolt's (second from right) nine gold medals. But Nesta Carter (second from left) has tested positive for a banned substance and the team has now been stripped of its 2008 title. Photo Run \nNesta Carter, a member of the 2008 Jamaican 4x100 meter gold-medal relay team alongside sprinting star Usain Bolt , has been disqualified from the Beijing Games. Carter tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug, the International Olympics Committee announced on Wednesday, and the team has been stripped of its medals. \nThe IOC began retesting 2008 and 2012 Olympic samples last year to detect banned substances that were not originally identified due to less-advanced technology at the time. Carter tested positive for the stimulant methylhexaneamine, which is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency.   \nCarter has not commented on his case and the IOC has not said whether Carter’s 2012 sample has been retested—he also ran on the 4x100 relay team with Bolt at the London Games. \nThe other members of the 2008 relay team were Asafa Powell and Michael Frater. The team won in a then-world record time of 37.10. \nFor Bolt, who ran the third leg of the relay, Carter’s positive drug test also results in losing the distinction of earning three gold medals at three consecutive Olympics—the “triple triple” in the 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 relay. \n“It’s heartbreaking because over the years you’ve worked hard to accumulate gold medals and work hard to be a champion,” Bolt told the Jamaica Gleaner in June. “When it’s confirmed or whatever, if I need to give back my gold medal I’d have to give it back, it’s not a problem for me.” \nIn 2008, Trinidad & Tobago won silver, Japan won bronze, and Brazil placed fourth in the 4x100 relay. All are likely to be upgraded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T09:17:19.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
