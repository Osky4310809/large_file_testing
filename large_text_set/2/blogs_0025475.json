In the clip above, giants Swizz Beatz and Just Blaze hit the decks to see who could better bring the heat. Moments like these are hard to come by in commercial hip-hop these days, but the battle was very reminiscent of the genre’s early years.\nThey went back and forth, with Swizz stating prior to the battle that there would be no use of pre-made beats. He also played an unreleased song featuring Nas, Jay Z, Jadakiss and DMX. Swizz Beatz is known for crafting the production for hits such as DMX’s “Ruff Ryders Anthem,” and Drake’s “Fancy,” while Just Blaze has been a regular producer for Jay Z, producing his classic “Public Service Announcement (Interlude).”\nBack in 2007, Swizz Beatz took on Kanye West in a beat battle while they were both on stage at Summer Jam . It’s difficult to say who won but the YouTube comments suggest it was closer to a draw.\nIn other music related news, Future earns his fourth consecutive No.1 album with last week’s release of FUTURE. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T15:14:25.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
