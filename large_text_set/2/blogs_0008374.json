He doesn't just learn the script, and make the appropriate expressions. He delves deep into every role that he plays, and goes to the extent of modifying his body. Recently, we saw the Fat to Fit transformation that he went through for Dangal . This wasn't the first time that Khan did something of the sort. For his movie Lagaan , he would walk around in scorching sun, in order to get the perfect tan for his role. Time and again, Aamir Khan has outdone himself. No wonder every time a new film is set for release, we can't wait! His upcoming movie, Thugs of Hindostan , features him and Amitabh Bachchan. We'll admit, this is enough to have us eagerly waiting for its release, which is scheduled for Diwali, 2018. But, wait until you see Aamir Khan's look for the film...
