Messi, meanwhile, simply ran the show, operating a dual role of director and leading star. Luis Enrique was also given the reception he deserved, with one section of fans even chanting for the coach to stay. \nNegatives \nCelta managed to create three clear openings, for Facundo Roncaglia, John Guidetti and Iago Aspas, which all missed the target. It will be forgotten about in the midst of all the praise for the attack but quality sides, starting with PSG, are unlikely to waste such opportunities. \nManager rating out of 10 \n8 -- Luis Enrique redeployed the 3-4-3 formation he used against Atletico Madrid and Sporting Gijon and it worked a treat once again. His team selection, which saw him rest Andres Iniesta and start with Rafinha, had some journalists in the Camp Nou press tribune scratching their heads but it paid off as Barca walked all over Celta. His substitutions were spot on, too, allowing Busquets and Neymar some welcome rest and giving Iniesta a much-needed run out. \nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10 = best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating) \nGK Marc-Andre ter Stegen, 6 -- Had little to deal with as Celta kept missing the target despite carving out a number of openings. Footwork was questionable at times. \nDF Sergi Roberto, 7 -- Did well in his role of shuttling between right midfield and right-back and almost scored a breathtaking goal when racing through from the halfway line but unlike Messi he had no composure when faced with Sergio Alvarez. \nDF Gerard Pique, 6 -- Didn't have his most composed display in defence as Celta created more chances than they should have. \nDF Samuel Umtiti, 7 -- Got off to a bad start with a scrappy clearance which Roncaglia should have punished but soon rode Barca's wave of confidence and scored his first goal for the club. \nDF Jordi Alba, 7 -- Made plenty of contributions in attack, giving Celta double problems down the left, as if worrying about a livewire Neymar wasn't enough. \nMF Ivan Rakitic, 8 -- Involved far more than in recent weeks, linking up brilliantly with Messi and Neymar for the second goal and always looking to make things happen, as well as scoring for second game running. \nMF Sergio Busquets, 7 -- A far better performance than what we've been seeing recently save for a lethargic early foul which earned him a booking. \nMF Rafinha, 6 -- Full of energy and drive, he laid on the ball for Rakitic's goal although should have scored himself in the first half when clean through. Lionel Messi showed why he is the best player on the planet, scoring two beautiful goals and leading Barca to a rout. \nFW Lionel Messi, 10 -- Looked raring to go from kick off and after hitting the post showed he meant business with his storming run towards goal from the halfway line for the opener, later adding another goal of similar quality. His passing and readiness to play the role of conductor of the orchestra was equally as impressive. \nFW Luis Suarez, 6 -- Unlucky not to score early on after a cheeky nutmeg but apart from that struggled to get involved in Barca's many attacks. \nFW Neymar, 9 -- Was looking like the Man of the Match until Messi turned it on but the Brazilian caused havoc for Celta all night, scoring his sixth goal in seven meetings with the Galicians with true panache. Always looked capable of breaking through with his dazzling runs from the left. \nSubstitutes \nMF Javier Mascherano (for Busquets), 6 -- Provided fresh legs to get Busquets ready for Wednesday. \nMF Andres Iniesta (for Sergi Roberto), 6 -- Gave the bouncing fans something else to cheer although could not help produce any more goals \nMF Denis Suarez (for (Neymar), NR -- Offered more control in midfield to see the game out. \nRichard Martin covers FC Barcelona for ESPN FC.
