Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nRagnar Klavan says he has noticed one big difference in English football since joining Liverpool - referees are more lenient with defenders. \nThe centre back has helped the Reds to second in the table since joining in the summer from Bundesliga side FC Augsburg. \nKlavan admits he has had to work hard in training with boss Jurgen Klopp and on match days to adapt to the English game and says he is learning all the time. \nBut one of the biggest factors in his education has been learning more about what he can get away with from referees. \nThe Estonian explained: \"In every training session, you try to get used to it.

There is a little bit more allowed in this league, from the referees, than I’m used to. \n“This is something that takes a little bit of time, that as a central defender you are allowed a little bit more. That’s the style of English football. Slowly, I’m getting there.” \nThe 31-year-old defender also told Liverpool's website how he is constantly trying to improve his game. Klavan was sent off in 2014 for Estonia against England in a Euro 2016 qualifier (Photo: Action Images) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T14:27:12.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
