The hilarious comedy created by Tina Fey charms us with its quirky sense of humor and fabulous optimism, and we can’t wait for it to come back. To make us feel even MORE excited, star Ellie Kemper teased that Season 3 of Kimmy Schmidt will have more singing, and we are totally down for that.\nAlthough Season 3 doesn’t have an official release date yet , the show has been filming in New York. Ellie Kemper was spotted on the streets of NYC in one of her classic, brightly-colored Kimmy outfits.\nEllie Kemper was spotted reading a book that may be a total game changer for Season 3. Steve Sands / Getty As you can see in the picture, Ellie reads from a book titled Does Heaven Exist? We already know that Kimmy was in a deeply religious cult during her time underground, and she has for the most part maintained her beliefs throughout the show. But in this photo, Ellie’s face looks VERY distraught as she portrays Kimmy reading this book. We bet the show deals with Kimmy questioning her religious beliefs in Season 3, and we say, “bring it on!”\nSteve Sands / Getty We love that the show tackles relevant issues through Kimmy’s naïve but positive point-of-view, and we are so curious to see the insightful hilarity they dig into on the concept of religion.\nOne of the reasons we watch the show is to see Kimmy’s offbeat but really poignant observations about the world. \nSo we can’t wait to see how Kimmy handles a HUGE questions like religion and belief in Season 3!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T01:33:54.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
