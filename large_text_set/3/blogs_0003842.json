Based on two promotional YouTube videos promoting the Bothwell experience, it looks like an actual must-visit attraction for Harry Potter nut jobs .\nBut you’ve gotta have about $550 bucks lying around and some fast fingers if you want to try it, because A) it’s for one weekend only as of now — August 11th-13th, 2017 — and B) tickets will likely go faster than a Firebolt once they go on sale on March 28th. \nAccording to Bothwell’s website, the weekend will be a full-on Live-Action Role Play (LARP). About 150 lucky guests will be sorted into houses , take witchcraft lessons, stay overnight in a 15th century castle, compete against other houses, and “celebrate at the school’s lavish banquet.”\nThis sounds like a dream come true for Potter fans, and also a total non-brainer idea that we wish we’d thought of first. Hopefully the event will be a magical success that transfigures into a full-time fandom experience, because this sounds Wizarding World levels of dope, and more than 150 muggles should be able to enjoy it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T20:11:09.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
