In his latest Instagram post, illustrator Rob Israel pictures President Putin lifting up a trollish Trump over The Lion King ’s Pride Rock as the tyke receives his (rumored) manna from heaven. Over the last few years, the Dallas-based illustrator has developed a following through his demonic and raucous depictions of pop culture. His imagery attracts through the grotesque. He filters politically charged work through a raspy and psychedelic aesthetic akin to Ed Roth’s Rat Fink. In addition to this Simba Trump, Israel has done renditions of a Bane Trump, Jabba the Hutt Trump, and Immortan Joe Trump. A photo posted by Rob (@robisrael) on Jan 20, 2017 at 9:57pm PST Israel says he depicted Trump as a baby because, like a child, the man has very thin skin and responds to every petty criticism with a rant and a tantrum. He decided to reference The Lion King because he believes the film’s depictions of power and purpose are compelling in the context of today’s political climate. “Both Simba and Trump are born into elite and powerful statuses. The message of 'Lion King' is that everyone serves a purpose in the circle of life,” he tells The Creators Project. “So the rich eat the poor much like Trump's predatory capitalist beliefs will hurt the less fortunate. He thinks of himself as a lion and believes he has been ordained to be president, even though he lost the popular vote by three million.” A photo posted by Rob (@robisrael) on Jan 20, 2017 at 8:58am PST \nThe illustration not only suggests Trump’s Russia-carried rise to power, it makes clear reference to the “Golden Shower” fiasco that erupted after BuzzFeed released a collection of memos that suggested that Trump was in cahoots with Putin during his campaign against Hillary Clinton. The dossier, written by an anonymous former British Intelligence official, suggests that Trump may be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow because of secret financial ties to Russia as well as certain sexual activities that took place during one of his visits there. The report alleges that our new Commander-in-Chief Trump arranged to have Russian prostitutes urinate on a bed at the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow that was previously used by Barack Obama.
