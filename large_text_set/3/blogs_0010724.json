Photo by Huy Mach, hmach@post-dispatch.com \nJEFFERSON CITY • The creation of a nonprofit organization designed to promote Gov. Eric Greitens may be a new wrinkle in Missouri politics, but it has become a common fundraising tool among politicians across the nation. \nYears before Greitens and his allies formed “A New Missouri” last month and opened an office in the capital city to collect money from undisclosed donors, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, another Republican, was using a similar setup as a vehicle to get his message out to voters. \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, also tapped a nonprofit organization for similar reasons, as did the Republican lieutenant governor of New Jersey, who is plotting a bid to take over for term-limited Gov. Chris Christie next year. \nOthers include gubernatorial candidates in North Carolina and Florida and GOP presidential candidates from Marco Rubio to Jeb Bush. \nAlthough they come from different states and different political parties, the organizations have one thing in common: It is hard, if not impossible, to track how much money they raise and spend on behalf of their candidates. \nAs first reported by the Kansas City Star , Greitens’ allies formed the organization to “promote ideas, policies and/or legislation to create more jobs, higher pay, safer streets, better schools, and more, for all Missourians.” \nAs Greitens’ campaign adviser Austin Chambers told the Post-Dispatch, A New Missouri will make sure people know about the governor and his agenda. \nAs a nonprofit, however, contributions to the organization — unlike a standard federal or state campaign fund — are not limited and donors are not required to be disclosed. \nThat means Greitens, a former Navy SEAL who had never held elected office, won’t have to rely on contributions coming in under new caps on campaign contributions approved by nearly 70 percent of Missouri voters in the 2016 election. \nThose caps ban the massive donations Greitens and others received during the hard-fought campaign from megadonors like Joplin-based roofing company owner David Humphreys and his family, who dropped millions into Republican campaign accounts in a quest to make Missouri a right-to-work state. \nChambers, the campaign consultant who oversaw Greitens’ successful 2016 campaign and remains actively involved advising the rookie governor, dismissed concerns raised about transparency and the new organization. \n“I don’t see it as an issue. When we’re out traveling amongst the people, they ask us about jobs. They ask about schools,” Chambers said. ‘This smells funny’ \nGreitens’ new committee — a 501(c)(4) under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, a social welfare organization with tax-exempt status — can raise unlimited amounts from anonymous donors. The committee can then give the money to a super PAC, which can spend money on advertisements on behalf of a candidate. \nThat’s how Greitens landed nearly a $2 million contribution shrouded in secrecy during his campaign from a political action committee called SEALs for Truth, which had gotten its largesse from the American Policy Coalition, a nonprofit similar to A New Missouri. \nThe formation of Greitens’ nonprofit has become fodder for Democrats in the Missouri Legislature. \n“Our governor campaigned on getting rid of corruption and this smells funny. At the end of the day, he’s going to have to answer for that,” said House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty, D-Kansas City. \nIn particular, they find it ironic that Greitens campaigned as an outsider touting ethics reform as his goal, only to follow in the footsteps of other politicians in creating a way to raise money without disclosing his donors. \n“He’s the one who campaigned on the anti-corruption and cleaning up state government. We were all called corrupt politicians. It sounds to me like perhaps he has joined in that corrupt politician category,” McCann Beatty said. \nThe issue of transparency comes as Greitens has already come under fire for refusing to reveal how much money companies and individuals contributed to his Jan. 9 inauguration party. \nGreitens also has not disclosed who is paying for his flights on private aircraft, although Chambers has said some of the money could come from groups like the Republican Governors Association and, in the future, A New Missouri. \nGreitens also has not released his income tax returns, which would show how much he received in book royalties, paid speaking engagements and other sources of income. \nEven Greitens’ fellow Republicans have expressed wariness of the lack of transparency in his administration. \nDuring budget talks last week, GOP lawmakers told Greitens’ chief of staff, Michael Roche, that they will not abide by the governor’s decision to spread the salary of his chief operating officer among several different agencies. Rather, they said they want Drew Erdmann’s pay to be reflected fully in the governor’s office budget. ‘An explosion of them’ \nCraig Mauger, executive director of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, said Snyder has tapped at least three organizations that are similar to Greitens’ during his tenure. \nThe first fund, however, was shuttered after there was outcry about the secrecy of how it was being funded, Mauger said. \n“It’s something that’s extremely troubling if you care about transparency,” Mauger said. \nIn his second nonprofit, Snyder disclosed the donors. A third nonprofit, formed by his allies in support of his exploring a bid for president, did not disclose donors, Mauger said. \n“The majority of this money, we can’t figure out where it’s coming from,” Mauger said. \nIn New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, ran into similar headaches with his 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization. The New York Times last year reported a state ethics panel launched a probe of de Blasio’s political nonprofit into allegations that it illegally lobbied the city in 2015. \nJordan Libowitz, spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the problems are likely to grow as the number of organizations skyrockets. \n“In the last few years, we’ve just seen an explosion of them across the country,” Libowitz said. \nCREW has filed complaints about some of the groups spending too much of their money on political activity in violation of IRS rules. \n“Unfortunately, we haven’t seen much in the way of action,” Libowitz said.
