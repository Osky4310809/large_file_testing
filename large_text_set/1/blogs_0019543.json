The film is about the 1994 Olympics scandal revolving around the attack on U.S. figure skater, Nancy Kerrigan. Her lead competitor, Tonya Harding , was believed to be behind the scheme, and needless to say, a giant legal and media storm erupted. I, Tonya will tell the story of Harding’s perspective during the attack and the aftermath.\nMargot Robbie has been training hard on the ice in order to nail her performance as Harding, while we’ve been waiting in the wings to hear who the film would cast as her onscreen skating rival. Finally, per Deadline , we have learned that Caitlin Carver will play Nancy Kerrigan in I, Tonya. \nYou may recognize Carver from Paper Towns or Rules Don’t Apply , but more likely you’ll recognize her from her television work.

The actress is also slated to appear in episodes of the upcoming show Dear White People, which is based on the film by the same name.\nGetty Images / Paul Archuleta Sebastian Stan has been cast as Harding’s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and Allison Janney as Harding’s mother, LaVona Golden. Check out this leaked photo of Robbie, Stan, and Janney from set.\nJust look at everyone’s ’90s hairstyles.
