For one, the Redskins have lacked credibility for decades, and nobody gives them the benefit of the doubt after their many, many public gaffes. What’s more, McCloughan is incredibly well-regarded as a talent evaluator, and, though he had his misses as any GM would, he brought in a handful of excellent players and helped lead the team to its best two-year stretch in decades. Finally, he is also very well-liked all around the league, and with the anonymous leaks coming from inside the organization painting him as a bad guy, just about nobody outside of Washington is defending the team.\nOne thing I will say: Players i talked to liked McCloughan. seemed genuine. Asked one tonight; he said he had nothing but respect 4 him.\n— John Keim (@john_keim) March 10, 2017 \n\nAll I can tell you is people in front offices around NFL are strongly defending McCloughan to me. They are absolutely shredding Washington.\n— mike freeman (@mikefreemanNFL) March 10, 2017 \n\nSame.

He owns his past. The struggle is real. But that building …\n— Seth Wickersham (@SethWickersham) March 10, 2017 \n\nShame on WASH for publicly trashing GM who needs care. Broncos stuck w/Matt Russell. He's turned life around and is one of NFL's best execs.\n— Mike Klis (@MikeKlis) March 10, 2017 \n\nThey're waging a PR battle w/anonymous sources trying to paint McCloughan as a drunk. Say he was? Now what? Cool battle to fight. Losers.\n— danny rouhier (@funnydanny) March 10, 2017 \n\nAn anonymous source blame Scot's drinking is really despicable. Front office guys were all out getting hammered all the time. Get him help.\n— danny rouhier (@funnydanny) March 10, 2017 \n\nWhy not get Scot McCloughan help? Why not rehab? Why not time away and let him work from home and sort it out? If there wasn't more to it…\n— Grant Paulsen (@granthpaulsen) March 10, 2017 \n\nSilver just said on NFL Network he's talked to McCloughan many times over past few days. Called it \"an anonymous after-the-fact smear job.\"\n— Bryan Frantz (@BFrantz202) March 10, 2017 \n\nLook, I have no problem with the firing. It's the smut campaign, waged against a man who obviously needs help, that's morally indefensible.\n— Mike Wise (@MikeWiseguy) March 10, 2017 \n\nSpot-on line from @JerryBrewer on the ways of Allen/Snyder botching the McCloughan situation. https://t.co/QYcfDbpez3 pic.twitter.com/sFQxRiCTZn \n— Mike Jones (@MikeJonesWaPo) March 10, 2017 \n\nRedskins Playing Dangerous PR Game with Scot McCloughan \nNot only are the Redskins coming off looking horrible, having taken the lowest of low roads, but McCloughan is coming off looking remarkably well for a guy who, by all (anonymous) accounts, showed up to work drunk repeatedly. He and his family have mostly remained quiet throughout the whole debacle, with only a few low-key public remarks made so far.\npic.twitter.com/eBqVKxFPk7 \n— Caden McCloughan (@CadenMcCloughan) March 10, 2017 \n\nLeadership is about making others better as a result of your presence & making sure that impact lasts in your absence\n— Jessica McCloughan (@JessicaMcCloug1) March 10, 2017 \n\nScot McCloughan's wife Jessica on Twitter. \nHer most recent 'like': pic.twitter.com/MhIgkrH8RI \n— Chad Ryan (@ChadwikoRCC) March 10, 2017 \n\nBut more than anything, this reeks of “same old Redskins.” The team is reeling, having let free agents Pierre Garcon, DeSean Jackson and Chris Baker all leave for other teams, and quarterback Kirk Cousins, who had the franchise tag placed on him for the second season in a row but has yet to sign it this year, is reportedly more interested in leaving than staying .\nFed up with the disastrous offseason and overall state of the team, Redskins fans have planned a “ March on Ashburn ” for Friday and Saturday mornings. By early Thursday, the march had garnered only mild support, with fewer than 20 people signed up to attend. But as Thursday’s events unraveled, the event gained traction and fans got riled up. By 7:30 a.m. Friday, more than 260 people had signed up for the march on Facebook, and nearly 900 more listed themselves as “interested.”\nThere was such support for the rally that the original one-day event was extended to a two-day march, allowing fans who wish to protest but have to work Friday morning the chance to gather on Saturday morning. Each rally is scheduled to start at 8 a.m. and go until 11 a.m.\nDanny’s Redskins Rant Sums Up Every Fan’s Pain, Anger \nKeep in mind, all of this is happening in March. Fans are protesting the team five months before it takes the field. The general manager was not present at the Scouting Combine — sometimes referred to as the “Super Bowl for scouts” — and team president Bruce Allen said it was due to family matters, adding McCloughan would return to work once he was finished handling those matters. Just a few days later, mere hours after free agency officially started — when front offices make ever-important decisions on the immediate and distant futures of their teams — the Redskins fired the man supposedly in charge of personnel decisions.\nIt is, in every sense of the phrase, an unprecedented disaster.\nNot surprisingly, another “D” word has been splattered across social media in recent hours: “dysfunction.” And then just about every known synonym came right after it.\nFunny that two years ago myself and others reported dysfunction in D.C. and were yelled down by beat writers. Look at that mess now.\n— Matt Miller (@nfldraftscout) March 10, 2017 \n\nGM who reportedly is a football mind and players GM, gone. The franchise record breaking QB 2Xs over wants a trade.
