MAHMOOD-YAKUBU \nThe chairman, however, said the elections declared inconclusive were done in line with the rules and regulations guiding the conduct of elections, adding that INEC would not lower the bar in the conduct of credible election. \n“We are conscious of our responsibilities and we are going to proceed as we have been doing’’. \nOn the court ordered re-run election, Yakubu said that the commission was left with Anambra Central Senatorial District legislative poll as the only one outstanding. \nThe chairman, who said that this was as a result of litigation surrounding the poll, expressed the hope that the litigation would be addressed for INEC to conclude the election. \nHe further said that the commission had two other bye-elections to conduct as a result of the death of two elected members. \nThese, according to him, were Warri South I State Constituency, Delta as well as the Mashi/Dutsi Federal constituency election, Katsina state. \nSpeaking on INEC staff indicted in election malpractices, Yakubu said that though it was painful that some members of staff of INEC were indicted, ‘’the givers of the bribes should also be sanctioned. \n“What we have been hearing about corruption in the electoral process is that, it has focused more on the taker, not about the giver. Somebody must have given for a person to take. \n“I am not excusing the taker at all, but if we must solve this problem, we must also beam our searchlight on the givers. \n‘’If there is nothing to give, there will be nothing to take. \n“So if we must have comprehensive solution to this problem, we must deal with both the givers and the takers.’’ Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:07:27.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
