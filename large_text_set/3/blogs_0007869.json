Instead, there were long sequences of niggling tackles and several instances of playacting to keep German referee Felix Zwayer busy. \nConsidering the amount of time the ball had previously spent in the air, it was surprising that United's goal came from a slick interchange of passing. Marouane Fellaini's chest control from Phil Jones' long pass was typically adept, though the delicacy with which he released Zlatan Ibrahimovic down the left flank was uncharacteristic. \nIbrahimovic got to the byline and his pass gave Mkhitaryan time to steady himself and slot the ball into an open net. The Armenian, whose collision with Vladimir Granat had led to the Rostov defender having to leave the field with a painful shoulder injury, had been lively and Mkhitaryan looked unfazed by conditions on his return to action after missing two weeks with a hamstring injury. \nMourinho, who had been surly during his pre-match duties, jumped up in celebration when his side took the lead. The Europa League has taken on greater importance as United's hopes of the gatecrashing the Premier League's top four are stymied by an inability to climb beyond sixth in the table. \nHad United maintained their lead, then next week's second leg would have been an easy stroll. But Rostov will not be in Manchester for a sightseeing mission. Having lifted their tempo from the start of the second half, the equaliser came. Timofei Kalachev's ball forward found Bukharov running beyond Jones and with time to guide his volley past Sergio Romero. \nThat inspired further Rostov sorties forward, as a loud home crowd urged on their heroes. Half chances came and went for substitute Christian Noboa and Kalachev, as United's players began to slip on a surface that kept deteriorating; Ibrahimovic twice lost his footing with nobody around him. Henrikh Mkhitaryan's away goal gave Manchester United the lead before Rostov hit back. \n2. Ibrahimovic keeps his cool \nUnited fans will get only one more view of Ibrahimovic in the next three weeks -- the second leg of this tie -- after he accepted a three-match ban for a retributive elbow on Bournemouth's Tyrone Mings last Saturday. \nWith the playing surface giving little opportunity for passes to be played along the ground, Ibrahimovic's skills in the air and his ability to control aerial balls came into heavy play. Rostov were, however, wise to that approach and fielded a five-man defence that had little pretension to converting to three when going on the attack, especially in the first half. \nIbrahimovic was permanently surrounded by yellow shirts and, with Mkhitaryan and Fellaini a considerable distance away, Pogba's usual attacking darts were also strictly rationed as he struggled in the centre of the field, where the pitch was at its worst. \nUnited's leading scorer is never one to shirk physical battles and spent much of his evening on the Don Delta as a target for clattering challenges. Rostov captain Aleksandr Gatskan dished out one of them in the first half and was booked for his troubles, meaning he will miss the second leg. \nUnlike on Saturday, though, Ibrahimovic did not allow himself to be provoked; he looked most annoyed by the indignity of the playing surface. Instead, his assist for Mkhitaryan's vital goal was coolness personified. \n3. New formation, mixed results for United \nMourinho, pounding up and down his technical area all evening, had abandoned all previous convention by fielding three at the back, with Jones accompanied by Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling. It signalled the manager's intention to escape from the southern reaches of Russia with either a narrow lead, a score draw or a saveable disadvantage. \nThe effect of that approach was to pack the midfield and reduce Rostov's limited -- until the latter stages -- attacking ambitions and to give Young and Blind licence to advance forward. \nFor the first half, it worked well, but Rostov's equaliser betrayed its shortcomings among defenders not used to the formation. Jones and Smalling were caught looking at each other as Bukharov stole in to score. At least United could be back in numbers when Rostov's late attempt at bombardment came. \nJohn Brewin is a staff writer for ESPN FC. Follow him on Twitter @JohnBrewinESPN.
