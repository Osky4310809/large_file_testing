Comedians Tig Notaro and Janeane Garofalo and Senators Al Franken and Cory Booker will also appear. All proceeds from the event will go to benefit Planned Parenthood. \nBeyoncé won’t be performing at either event, but she’s shared a brief statement about the March on Facebook . “Together with Chime for Change, we raise our voices as mothers, as artists, and as activists,” she writes. “As #GlobalCitizens, we can make our voices heard and turn awareness into meaningful action and positive change. #WomensMarch.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T05:54:48.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
