Now, we’re back with yet another light-hearted take surrounding the new action franchise.\nIn this fun-filled parody, we find the neo-noir thriller remade with Nerf weapons . John Wick can thus be seen taking on assault after assault, eliminating the bad guys with Nerf guns, of course as opposed to actual weaponry.\nTo view the comedic reimagining, press play above. Also, see underneath for the aforementioned John Wick dog parody.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:47:22.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
