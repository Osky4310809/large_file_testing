As we have informed each of them to come clean on their undisclosed income, stringent action will be taken if they fail to comply with our directive to make use of the PMGKY scheme,\" Bengaluru Chief Commissioner of Income Tax Bishwanath Jha told reporters here. \nAfter the 8 November demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, the central government unveiled the PMGKY amnesty scheme from 16 December, 2016 to 31 March, 2017 for declaring unaccounted wealth (black money) and avoiding prosecution by paying a fine of 50 percent on the undisclosed income. \nThe amount deposited in the scheme is refundable after four years without interest.
