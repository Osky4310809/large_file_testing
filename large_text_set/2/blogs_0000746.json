The International Society for Sexual Medicine defines premature ejaculation as ejaculating within one minute of vaginal penetration for primary, or a decrease in time it takes to ejaculate, usually within three minutes, for acquired. In order to meet criteria for diagnosis, you also must be unable to delay your ejaculation, and the issue must cause you some kind of emotional distress. \nResearchers from a previous study on the effects of acupuncture and premature ejaculation theorize that the needles may stimulate a biological response in your body . This may alter the production of neurotransmitters in your brain, which can prove beneficial in premature ejaculation. In fact, that may be why antidepressants called serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are usually the first-line medical treatment for it. \nIf the thought of getting stuck with needles makes you queasy, SSRIs or an opioid pain-reliever tramadol can help you last longer in bed , too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:04:52.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
