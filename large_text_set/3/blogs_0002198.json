It’s fascinating to watch him maneuver between them all. \nWe may not all be scientists, but we often have ideas that we want to get across. How well do we adapt what we say based on the audience? I’ve been to plenty of debates on philosophy — and read several books about the subject — where it felt like everything was way over my head. And there were other books geared to a more knowledgeable audience that never went beyond the 101 level. Why waste my time? \nEvery communicator should be able to handle this challenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T14:12:11.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
