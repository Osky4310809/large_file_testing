The only real impact of this is that the pile of negative reviews immediately become reviews of \"previous versions\".One of the more recent changes is an inability to prevent automatic loading of images in messages. This allows spammers to confirm they have an active address and to know your rough location for their databases.This app ceased to be a legitimate email app several months ago. Things you can't do:- copy/paste text- edit forwards (sometimes I need to remove headers for privacy reasons)- add senders to contactsAnd this doesn't even begin to address all the aesthetic and UI failures mentioned by other reviewers.Until last fall, this was a five star app. The last several updates have removed vital functionality. In addition, they seem to be releasing a new update every couple of days (15, I think, since late November!) with no noticeable changes in what I can only assume is an attempt to minimize the impact of all be bad reviews (very few of them will then be for the \"current version\"). Google should be deeply ashamed of its shoddy work on this app. Google is my preferred email provider with the best app to complement by daveedo Using an iPhone 7 128GB with iOS 10.1.1I have multiple Gmail accounts including a work account and the gmail app makes it incredibly easy to switch between my accounts. I also am very fond of the new layout including the mark as unread button. Another big plus is how well Google Apps such as Maps, gmail, and hangouts integrate with each other on the iPhone. Google has done a great job improving gmail with their most recent application updates including features and performance. Love my GMail by Juanibear61 I've had my gmail for years and won't trade it, I have Yahoo email too, although I do like Yahoo because it's better at taking care of all the spam, I like the update of gmail for emptying trash & spam with a click. I would love that feature for inbox too, instead of having to select each email individually, on my phone, I do have it on my computer which is great but don't like the desk top version on my phone it's not convenient since its small lol, I know I can change the size, but don't want to how about adding that feature for the inbox?
