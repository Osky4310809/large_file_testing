PHOTO | LABAN WALLOGA | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary Ferry services at Mtongwe were halted after the government decommissioned two old ferries for being unseaworthy. Dilapidated infrastructure also caused withdrawal of services. Advertisement More by this Author Resumption of ferry service at the Mtongwe Channel has drawn mixed reactions from residents. While some have lauded the government for the reintroduction of service at the channel, others have raised concerns over the operation schedule. Two days after President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned MV Likoni for use, some residents said they were now relieved. “We used to go all the way to the Likoni channel which was challenging to us. I hope Kenya Ferry Service (KFS) sustains it,” said Pius Makani. Another resident, Nelson Ndereni, said he is now able to save the money he has been using for transport. “I used to spend Sh100 daily for transport when I was using the Likoni channel, but since Tuesday I have been saving that money,” Mr Ndereni said. Related Content A spot check by the Nation revealed that only a handful of people were using the channel at the moment. Some residents have said there is need for the ferry to work for a whole day. Others have expressed concern over the time spent when it docks. “They need to bring a ferry that will fit and make the docking process easier and save time,” said Ali Mwarizo. The KFS management has deployed the MV Likoni to operate from 4am to 10am in the morning and 4pm to 10pm in the evening. KFS Managing Director Bakari Gowa said based on the response or demand from the people, the management will consider introducing whole day services at the channel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:09:45.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
