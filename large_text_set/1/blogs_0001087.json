Most Popular By Kyle Mizokami Dec 29, 2016 The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is the largest defense program ever created. The effort to produce three variants of the plane is billions of dollars over budget and at least five years behind schedule. At least ten countries will buy an estimated 3,100 of the controversial jets through 2035. The tiny nation of Denmark, looking to replace its venerable 48-strong F-16A Fighting Falcon fleet, is purchasing 27 F-35As. And the country's armed forces, the Forsvaret , are showing off just what the plane can do.

The video celebrates a Royal Danish Air Force F-16 (nicknamed \"210\") loaned to the F-35 program. A \"chase\" plane, 210's role is as wingman to test planes as they are put through their paces at Edwards Air Force Base in southern California. Most Popular While the video is generally about the flight test support, it also includes some amazing footage. The video includes low-level flight, AMRAAM air-to-air missile launches, Joint Directed Attack Munition precision-guided bomb drops, and even aerial firing the F-35's three-barrel gatling gun. The most incredible footage is of the high angle of attack/out of control testing, when the F-35 flies below stall speed and begins to fall out of control. The F-35 pilot is still able to point the nose where he or she wants it, ensuring the plane can recover and resume flightâ€”on nearly any heading. It's a hell of a trick, and one that is sure to come in handy sooner or later.
