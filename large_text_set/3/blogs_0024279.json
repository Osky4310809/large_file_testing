Martin O'Neill somberly confirms that Ireland captain Seamus Coleman broke his leg in their draw with Wales. \nRepublic of Ireland captain Seamus Coleman has undergone surgery on a broken leg as he faces up to a lengthy spell on the sidelines. \nColeman, 28, suffered a double fracture of his lower right leg during Friday night's 0-0 World Cup qualifying draw with Wales at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. \nThe Everton full-back was hurt in a challenge by Wales wing-back Neil Taylor, who was sent off as a result, 69 minutes into the match. \nHe was treated at length on the pitch and was given oxygen as he was comforted by teammate Shane Long, and eventually left on a stretcher. \nColeman was taken straight to St Vincent's University Hospital in the city, where he underwent surgery on Saturday morning on his right tibia and fibula. \n\"Captain Seamus Coleman, who went off injured during the game, underwent surgery on Saturday morning after fracturing his right tibia and fibula, under the care of the FAI's orthopaedic surgeon, Professor John O'Byrne and Mr. Gary O'Toole, consultant orthopaedic surgeon,\" a Football Association of Ireland (FAI) statement read. \"Coleman's condition will be monitored over the coming days.\" \nColeman was visited in hospital by manager Martin O'Neill and his assistant on Friday night as graphic pictures of the damage circulated on social media. TV broadcaster RTE showed no replays of the tackle on the grounds of taste. We'd like to send our best wishes to Seamus Coleman following his injury this evening. Get well soon, Seamus. #COYBIG pic.twitter.com/kYwcPBAsC0 - FAIreland (@FAIreland) March 24, 2017 \n\"Seamus suffered a serious leg injury and has undergone surgery,\" O'Neill told the FAI's official website. \"He has had an exceptional season with both club and country, and he will be a big loss.\" \nFAI CEO John Delaney added: \"Seamus has been a terrific captain for his country, and on behalf of the FAI Board and everyone in the association, I want to send Seamus our very best wishes. We look forward to welcoming Seamus back to the Ireland team, following his recovery.\" \nThe former Sligo Rovers player was appointed Ireland captain by O'Neill during the Euro 2016 finals in France and has become one of the mainstays of his team. \nFriday's draw left Ireland locked together with Serbia at the top of Group D at the halfway stage of the campaign, but it remains to be seen what part Coleman will be able to play in the rest of it. \nHis plight prompted support from colleagues and fans with former Everton teammate Leon Osman backing him to return stronger. \n\"I'm absolutely gutted for him. I wish him all the best and a speedy recovery,\" Osman told Everton's official website . \"Knowing him, though, he'll come back better, fitter and stronger. That's the type of character he is. Seamus Coleman receives treatment after sustaining his injury. \n\"He was playing for Sligo Rovers in the Irish league when he was 20, so he's got a real appreciation for the game. He's a real nice, genuine lad -- he doesn't carry any of the arrogance a lot of footballers have. \n\"I've got all the time in the world for him. He's one of the genuine nice guys in football. It's upsetting it's happened to any player, never mind such a top guy in Seamus. Seamus is the type of guy who will be devastated, but he'll work his socks off to get back as quick as he can. \n\"Watching the game, the moment it happened, Evertonians were devastated to lose such an influential character -- he's a future captain of Everton Football Club. It's a big loss and everyone felt it. Everyone loves Seamus and will be desperate to get him back as soon as he possibly can.'' \nWales manager Chris Coleman said after Friday's game that Taylor, who missed most of the 2011-12 season with a broken ankle, was \"despondent in the dressing room.\" \n\"Neil Taylor is not really that type of player but it's a tough one for Seamus,\" Coleman said. \"Our thoughts are with him. I have not seen it again. \n\"Neil is in the dressing room, he's despondent. If he's got it wrong, he's had a serious injury himself. I have my fingers crossed for Seamus Coleman, he is the most important thing tonight.\" \nWales midfielder Joe Allen added on Taylor: \"He's in bits to be honest. Tayls is one of my best mates and he's a great guy. He's really disappointed that one of his tackles has ended up getting someone hurt. \n\"But unfortunately in football these things can happen. There was no malice in the tackle and he certainly wouldn't have intended to hurt anyone. I know him as well as anyone and I think everyone is disappointed, and from Seamus' point of view it doesn't look great.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T18:39:14.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
