I stumbled onto a bug I think. \nSettings > Display won’t open when clicked on. Running `xfce4-display-settings` from the terminal gives segmentation fault. This is on a VirtualBox install. The same is not happening with Linux Mint 18.0 Xfce. Pjotr January 5th, 2017 at 4:57 pm \nThanks for this fine bèta release! As usual, Xfce is stable as a rock. 🙂 \n@xenopeek: I can’t reproduce the error you report, on my Mint 18.1 Xfce (ordinary hard disk installation). xfce4-display-settings works fine, also when launched from the terminal. The error you have, might be related to VirtualBox. Dtuxcomp January 5th, 2017 at 5:18 pm \nDownloading now. Tried v 18.0 but as I use KDE aps including dolphin within XFCE gave up on it as the various icons etc were missing and just didn’t have the time to fiddle with fixing it when v 17.3 is working fine. I know this is a beta but will put it through it’s paces. Thanks. D. \nEdit by Clem: I’m not sure it made it into this ISO, but it should definitely be in the stable one. To fix this issue, install libqt5libqgtk2 and libqt5svg5. Shawn January 5th, 2017 at 6:28 pm \nTo Clem I noticed that some of the plans for 18.2 I do not like 1 please do not remove synaptic package manager from the default selection I depend upon synaptic package manager I use it when I set up a new system I can select all the software I want to Install and it downloads and installs it for me I do not like the software manager for installing all my software but it is still useful to me I use it to browse and look for new stuff another thing please do not enable the bookmarks toolbar by default i will just turn it off I do not use it because it takes up more space I think the bookmarks menu is better I do not know if you plan on removing synaptic completely but you are planning on removing it from favorites and from mintmenu’s favorites please do not do that i don’t mind if you in mintupdate, remove dep on synaptic, remove admin rights for checkAPT.py \nin mintsources, remove dep on synaptic but removing synaptic is only going to make it harder for me to setup systems because i will have to install it first i have had nothing but trouble with the software manager if i try to install everything i have to install items one at a time with synaptic its easier because i select everything i need installed and it gets downloaded and installed now if the software manager supported installing software in batches like synaptic does then i might use it instead i like synaptic because it has features i use that no other package manager has like fix broken packages and delete all cached files now button synaptic also comes in handy as a repair tool i have used it to repair systems with broken packages and other problems \nnow for things i do like \nxed: sorting lines: add a simple Edit->Sort Lines (F9), which sorts the selection or the entire file (if no selection is done) make sure it’s undoable remove the sort plugin import libpeas support from gedit, to allow python3 extensions add word-wrap setting to View menu and buttons available in the toolbar customization \nxplayer: focus window when a video file is opened visualizations don’t work", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T10:17:14.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
