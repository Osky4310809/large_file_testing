Twitter \nI’m going to take a wild guess and say her BF came back early from work. \nThe whole glorious thing was caught on camera by some guy passing him in a car. It shows his shameful pink buns shuffling through the blizzard-like conditions somewhere in the world. Twitter \nThe guy in the car rolls down his window and says, \nWhat the fuck, you all right? \nNow, the alleged cheater is talking so fast (probably because of the cool breeze clinging to his manhood), it’s hard to tell what he’s saying. Twitter \nBut it sounds a whole lot like this: \nYeah, I’m good. I got caught fucking someone’s bitch. Can you give me a ride, yo? \nHis savior in the car agrees to take him home, as apparently he only lives around the corner. \nBut this guy’s bad luck is about to reach unthinkable levels, because as he goes to open the door he drives off. \nEvil. Pure, trolling evil. But so, so funny. Twitter \nYou can hear the nude dude cursing and shouting at the driver as he leaves him to potentially die. It’s pretty strong trolling game when you’re risking someone’s life/prison record. I’m not sure how to feel about it. \nNaturally, the video was posted to Twitter. Twitter \nThe cameraman captioned it, \nThis n***a got caught fucking somebody bitch now this n***a stranded in ah blizzard. This n***a got caught fucking somebody bitch now this n***a stranded in ah blizzard. pic.twitter.com/rDUSsBStbq \n— yung skii♱ (@skiixxi) January 8, 2017 \nIt makes this cheating revenge savagery look like child’s play. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
