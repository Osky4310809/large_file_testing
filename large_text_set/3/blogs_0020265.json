In addition to competing on “Dancing With the Stars,” the former catcher’s memoir is now being turned into a movie. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter , Radar Pictures is developing a film based on Ross’ memoir, ‘ Teammate: My Journey in Baseball and a World Series for the Ages. ‘ That film will bring the Chicago Cubs’ incredible and historic 2016 World Series victory to the big screen and tell the story through Ross’ eyes. \nHere’s a brief summary of Ross’ book, which is authored by the catcher and sportwriter Don Yaeger and will be released this May. \nRecalling the important moments in Ross’ 15-year career, the book centers on his final game, when he became the oldest player to homer in a Game 7 of the World Series, helping the Cubs rally from a 3 games to 1 deficit to overtake the Cleveland Indians and win their first championship since 1908. \nBefore the season, the amiable Ross announced that 2016 would be his final year, and his teammates desperately wanted to win the Series for their emotional leader, whom they nicknamed “Grandpa Rossy.” \nGiven the circumstances and theatrics surrounding Ross’ impact on the Cubs, his impending retirement and team’s long road to glory, this seems like a no-brainer to find Hollywood eventually. \nWho knows how long it may take to materialize, but it shouldn’t be much of a shock that a studio immediately pounced on the opportunity to bring the Cubbies’ championship to the big screen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:05:55.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
