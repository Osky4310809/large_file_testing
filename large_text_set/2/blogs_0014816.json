I could recite the Our Father backwards, drugged with a gun to my head. If you need to read this prayer, you're not Christian (re: Melania). \n— Nicole Angeleen (@NicoleAngeleen) February 19, 2017 \nOthers took time to attack the president as well. Cool. She's definitely never read the Bible, nor has her husband, whose entire life is a middle finger aimed at its teachings and followers. https://t.co/2nGiL0qDDe \n— Ken Tremendous (@KenTremendous) February 19, 2017 \nThe attacks against the first lady represent the heart of liberalism, and how it thrives on hate. \nIn case you missed it, a video of Melania reciting the prayer is below: \nIt’s no surprise atheists and leftists attacked Trump for reciting the prayer. They have repeatedly tried to eliminate God from daily discourse, and they try at every opportunity to quash even the slightest hint of Christianity. \nThese kinds of attacks demonstrate just how much the left loves to preach about tolerance and acceptance but never have any intention of following through on those grandiose ideals. They want to appear tolerant, but their words and actions reveal how truly hypocritical they are. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter if you agree that the left attacking Melania Trump for reciting “The Lord’s Prayer” at the rally in Florida is about as low as it gets.
