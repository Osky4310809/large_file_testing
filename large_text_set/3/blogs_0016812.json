I've been thinking about this stuff for a long time,\" Ryan said. \"We're on the cusp of doing something we've long believed in.\" \nLowry quipped that \"I was thinking about something else [at keg parties]. He was thinking about reforming Medicaid.\" \nRyan didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. \nA video of the discussion was posted on YouTube on Friday. \nThe American Health Care Act, which Republicans rolled out earlier this month to replace Obamacare, would cost 24 million Americans their health insurance by 2026, the Congressional Budget Office found last week. President Donald Trump has endorsed the plan , but nearly 60 Republicans in Congress have said they have \"serious concerns\" about it. \nRyan, 47, holds a bachelor's degree from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:17:10.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
