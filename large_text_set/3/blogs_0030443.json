This five-move bodyweight session combines a little bit of plyo, some cardio, and a lot of strength training to give you a total-body workout that'll tone your abs, whittle your waist, lift your booty, and strengthen your arms. You'll be done in just five minutes, but you'll still be feeling crazy sore the next day.\nRelated:\nGet Washboard Abs With This 5-Minute, No-Equipment Workout\nPrevious Next", "external_links": ["http://www.barrysbootcamp.com/san-francisco-fidi/location"], "published": "2017-03-28T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:22:15.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
