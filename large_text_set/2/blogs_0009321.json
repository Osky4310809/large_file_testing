Are you Welsh? Ooh lovely.” Jeremy Kyle made fun of the new security guard (Photo: ITV) Fans were quick to comment on the new guy's appearance (Photo: ITV) Jeremy tried to get Steve to do a Welsh accent (Photo: ITV) \nJeremy then goaded security guy Steve into doing a Welsh accent – but to no avail. \nDespite the new guy’s shyness, fans took to Twitter in their droves to comment on the hunky new addition to the show. \nLast week, Jeremy Kyle viewers were forced to turn the subtitles on during the show. \nTrevor appeared on the show to accuse his girlfriend of snogging two different women. \nWhile Jeremy appeared to feel for the man at first after he admitted he was \"really nervous,\" the host's sympathy quickly came to an end when the bloke admitted to also kissing two other people. \nThat was all well and good, but many ITV viewers rushed to Twitter to reveal that they had no idea what was going on - because they couldn't understand a word! Viewers couldn't understand Trevor (Photo: ITV) Fans rushed to Twitter to share their confusion (Photo: ITV) \nTrevor's accent was so strong, and he was speaking so quietly, that without subtitles he was barely audible.

I refuse to turn the TV up #jeremykyle,\" ranted a second. Thank god for subtitles (Photo: ITV) \nThink we need a translator for this one #JeremyKyle,\" added a third confused viewer. \nA fourth said: \"Is that guy even speaking words? How can anyone actually understand him? #jeremykyle\" \nIt was all happy news in the end for the couple though, after Trevor's girlfriend passed the lie detector with flying colours.
