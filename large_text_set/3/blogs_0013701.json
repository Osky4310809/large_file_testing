(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) The Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Latest on a congressional inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election (all times local): \n11:25 a.m. \nMike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, is denying that the British intelligence community was ever asked to conduct electronic surveillance on President Donald Trump at the behest of former President Barack Obama. \nEarlier this month, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer referred to unsubstantiated allegations made by a Fox News analyst that GCHQ, the British electronic intelligence agency, had helped Obama wiretap Trump. The British intelligence agency flatly denied it happened. \nThe ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, asked Rogers if he thought it was \"utterly ridiculous\" that anyone in the U.S. would ask British spies to do surveillance on a presidential candidate. Rogers said it was and added that he had seen nothing at the NSA that would indicate that happened. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe Senate's top Democrat says that President Donald Trump \"severely damaged his credibility\" with Twitter postings claiming that former President Barack Obama ordered wiretaps of him. \nNew York Sen. Charles Schumer issued the statement after FBI Director James Comey told a House panel that there was no information that supports Trump's allegation. \nSchumer said Trump \"needs to retract his claim immediately.\" \nHe added that Trump \"should admit he was wrong, stop the outlandish tweets.\" \n___ \n11:10 a.m. \nFBI Director James Comey says the FBI and Justice Department have no information to substantiate President Donald Trump's claims that former President Barack Obama wiretapped him before the election. \nComey says no individual can order surveillance of an American. He says courts grant this permission after a rigorous application process. \nComey was testifying before the House intelligence committee. Comey said the Justice Department also asked him to share with the committee that the answer also applies to the Justice Department and its various components. The Justice Department oversees the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. \n___ \n10:48 a.m. \nFBI Director James Comey and Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, say they have no evidence or intelligence that Russian cyber actors changed vote tallies in key states during last year's presidential election. \nTestifying at a highly politically charged congressional hearing in the House, both said they had no evidence that any vote tallies were changed in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina or Ohio. \nThe House intelligence committee is holding a hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \n___ \n10:45 a.m. \nNational Security Agency Director Michael Rogers says the intelligence community stands behind its January assessment that it is highly confident Russia interfered in the 2016 election with the goal of electing Donald Trump. \nIn a Monday morning tweet, Trump blamed Democrats for the investigation into his contacts and said the House intelligence committee should be focus on investigating leaks. \nRogers said that his agency is working to provide Congress the material it needs to investigate the intelligence agencies' findings. \nRogers was testifying before the House intelligence committee alongside FBI Director James Comey. \n___ \n10:35 a.m. \nFBI Director James Comey is publicly confirming for the first time that the FBI is investigating Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including any potential coordination between Trump campaign associates and Russia's government. \nComey is testifying before Congress. He says he's authorized by the Justice Department to make the disclosure. Typically, the FBI does not discuss or even confirm the existence of ongoing investigations. \nComey says the probe is part of the FBI's counter-intelligence mission. He says the investigation includes the nature of any links between individuals associated with Trump's campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between Russia's efforts and the campaign. \nComey says the investigation will also look at whether crimes were committed. He says he can't provide details about the investigation. \n___ \n10:25 a.m. \nThe top Democrat on the House intelligence committee says he hopes FBI Director James Comey will put questions about whether Trump Tower was wiretapped by President Barack Obama \"permanently to rest.\" \nRep. Adam Schiff is speaking at the start of the committee's hearing on Russia's interference in the presidential election. Comey is testifying at the hearing, along with National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers. \nSchiff says Democrats on the committee will be focused in part on whether Americans helped Russia with its hacking of Democratic groups and individuals. \nTrump has said he has no knowledge of his associates coordinating with Russia during the election. He's refused to back down from his assertion that Obama wiretapped his New York City skyscraper during the campaign, despite there being no evidence. \n__ \n10:10 a.m. \nThe chairman of the House intelligence committee says there was no physical wiretap on Trump Tower, but it's possible that \"other surveillance activities\" were used against President Donald Trump and his associates. \nRep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is speaking at the opening of the committee's first public hearing on Russia's interference in the 2016 election. He says the committee has seen no evidence to date that officials from any campaign conspired with Russian agents, but will continue to investigate that question. \nHe also says the committee will investigate who has been leaking classified information about investigations into Russia's interference. \nNunes says he hopes the committee's hearings will result in a \"definitive report\" on Russia's involvement in the presidential election. \n___ \n7 a.m. \nPresident Donald Trump is accusing Democrats of fabricating allegations about Russia and creating more \"fake news.\" \nHis tweets came just hours before a congressional hearing on Russia. The House Intelligence Committee will hear from FBI Director James Comey on whether U.S. officials believe Russia tried to bolster Trump's chances in the election and if there were any connections between Moscow and Trump's campaign aides. \nTrump tweeted Monday: \"The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!\" \nA separate tweet referenced James Clapper, the director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama, who has said that Trump's allegation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower is false. \"James Clapper and others stated there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it.\" \nTrump also tweeted that the \"real story\" is the leaking of classified information. \n___ \n3:30 a.m. \nA congressional inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election that has so far unfolded behind closed doors moves into the open with a public hearing featuring FBI Director James Comey. \nA hearing Monday before one of several congressional panels probing allegations of Russian meddling, the House Intelligence Committee, could allow for the greatest public accounting to date of investigations that have shadowed the Trump administration in its first two months. \nComey has been invited to testify, along with the director of the National Security Agency, Michael Rogers. \nThe committee is investigating, among other things, Russian hacking that intelligence officials have said was meant to influence the election. Also of interest to the committee are any connections between Russia and associates of President Donald Trump. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
