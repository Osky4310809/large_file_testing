The sequel to 2011’s Ensemble Studios’ spinoff makes big advancements, particularly by adding PC players to the mix, but controls once again hamper the RTS experience on console.\nBefore the original Halo Wars on Xbox 360, console-based RTS games didn’t have a whole lot going for them. Between the blighted ports of games like Command and Conquer: Red Alert and Battle for Middle Earth , there was a sizable void that no one dared to fill. Respectable RTS games like Starcraft and Total War required the precision of a mouse and keyboard. A controller couldn’t keep up. But Creative Assembly’s Halo Wars 2 begs to differ.\nIt’s a Halo game through and through While this isn’t a first-person shooter, Halo fans will rejoice at how familiar the environments look and feel. It’s one gorgeous, gleaming map after another, peppered with stunning cut-scenes in between.\nThe Ark, introduced in Halo 3 as the birthplace of the Halo rings themselves, sets the stage for Halo Wars 2 . But as Alice-130 and Douglas-042, two-thirds of the Spirit of Fire’s Spartans, discover when they go to investigate this mysterious structure they’ve been summoned to: humanity is going to need to fight for survival once again. They will need to wrest control of the Ark’s incredible power from a new enemy. A powerful Brute, formerly of the Covenant, by the name of Atriox, has built a formidable army of fellow Brutes and ruthless mercenaries, The Banished. The Banished will stop at nothing to possess the Ark and all of the power contained within.\nStorytelling is part of what the Halo series excels at. The scrappy underdogs are given limited resources and asked to perform miracles, all while trying not to die horribly at the hands of aliens that are bent on blasting human civilization to oblivion. It’s easy to identify with the key characters in Halo games, because they’re each of us. Halo Wars 2 is no different. I often found myself nodding along with Anders and laughing along with Alice. The game’s personality shines through even the most mundane of moments.\nThe story is the one of the only reasons why I played the campaign to its conclusion. Unlike other games in the Halo series, Halo Wars 2 has a narrative that feels coherent from start to finish. The mission story-arcs fit well with one another. There’s no “skippable” mission in the middle of the game. And while there are only twelve missions in total, each one is narratively necessary. By contrast, Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty had twenty-nine missions, where more than a few felt like padding. Keeping the campaign drawn into a relatively short experience meant that the story had very little opportunity to go off the rails.\nOne of the gems towards the beginning of the game is mission One Three Zero, where Alice-130 has to rescue her troops from The Banished. As Alice-130 moves through the map, Spartan-smashing Banished and taking control of enemy vehicles, her sarcasm and hilarious bravado made me laugh out loud more than once. When she’s finally able to get in contact with the Spirit of Fire and Captain Cutter, the confidence and determination that she instills in her troops as they have to hold the line for backup is what kept me focused during exasperating moments of gameplay.\nThe story fell down for me towards the end of the game. While the missions each had their redeeming qualities, the conclusion was dissatisfying. It felt open-ended enough for an additional sequel, which is nice, but it felt far less compelling than the end of the original Halo Wars game. Depending on how you finished the original game, it was either finite (with the crew in cryosleep) or teasing. There was a little wiggle room, but not like in Halo Wars 2 . And as much as I appreciate a confident stride towards Sequeldom, this wasn’t quite the right approach.\nHalo Wars 2 is just the right combination of frenetic urgency and cheeky levity. Captain Cutter urges the Red Team onward, pushing players to complete what seems to be the impossible. It’s the kind of stress that Halo fans have come to love and expect. The banter between the Spartans, Professor Anders’ delightful snark and even the little quips from your troops (“Give me something to burn!”) as you interact with them are all grin-worthy moments in the midst of the tumult. Those affable interludes make having to play the same mission over and over again far more enjoyable.\nControllers can’t quite keep up, but they sure try Ensemble Studios’ Halo Wars invaded the traditional RTS space in 2009. There was no immediate PC port for stubborn old-school RTS players. You want a Halo RTS experience? Roll up your sleeves and leave your keyboard on your desk. Halo Wars wasn’t just an RTS for a console, it was an RTS built specifically for a controller. It wasn’t meant to emulate a mouse and keyboard. Players had to make nice with bumpers and triggers, resisting the itch for a mousewheel. For console gamers who had never played an RTS, Halo Wars was both accessible and challenging in all the right ways.\nHalo Wars 2 , as an evolution of the original, manages to effectively pack an entire suite of RTS controls into a relatively small space, which is a feat unto itself. If you’ve never played an RTS game, let alone one on a console, Halo Wars 2 is the best place to start. The experience is as player friendly as RTS games get. But if you’re a traditional RTS gamer who relies on a mouse and keyboard for sanity’s sake, you’re going to be in for a rough time. It’s a ton of breaking down old habits and building new ones. Using triggers, bumpers, and the D-Pad for troop management and control takes some getting used to.\nHalo Wars 2 approaches elegance in gameplay, but doesn’t quite hit the mark. So much of the focus, even in the tutorials, is on how to use the controls. Methodically onboarding players into the experience is crucial, especially for those new to the Halo Wars systems. Once you’re through both tutorials, it’s still difficult to keep track of how to select troops and effectively organize them into squads. If you’re fumbling with irritating complexities of movement and management, you’re not actually playing the game.\nTime is everything in real-time strategy. There’s no way to pause and direct troops in a slow, methodical capacity. Being hindered by a controller adds precious seconds. Those seconds cascade into late unit upgrades, slow troop builds and inevitably getting crushed by Atriox and his Banished army. As much as restarting missions is a part of the RTS ethos, it’s one thing to do so to learn the tactics — it’s quite another to restart because you simply can’t move fast enough with the controller.\nReal-time strategy games aren’t meant for consoles. And while Halo Wars 2 is a much better experience than most console-ports of popular RTS games, it lacks precision (and a high-DPI mouse). Thankfully, Halo Wars 2 supports Xbox Play Anywhere, so players won’t be tethered to their Xbox One controllers. And I won’t be nearly as tempted to throw my controller against the wall in a frustrated rage.\nIt’s always better with friends The myriad of multiplayer options is what gives Halo Wars 2 the longevity and flexibility it needs to survive beyond the first couple of weeks. Though the campaign is robust and enjoyable, especially with the option for co-op, it isn’t particularly long.\nHalo Wars 2 has all the usual multiplayer modes you would expect — Domination, Skirmish, Deathmatch — and they're effective enough. The maps range from formidable to downright punishing, depending on the mode. Teaming up with a friend and mowing through AI is all maniacal laughter and quoting war movies. And I’ll admit that it’s fun to take control of the points in Dominion, especially while utilizing the staggering array of leader powers. (That, and Overwatch has taught me that Holding The Point is the only thing that matters in life.) But Halo Wars 2 's multiplayer truly shines with the Blitz deck building mode.\nBlitz is where I’ve been spending the majority of my multiplayer time. Blitz draws quite a bit of its inspiration from the Halo 5: Guardians Warzone mode. Requisition card packs are earned through gameplay (or can be purchased from the Xbox Store) and are used to build decks for an array of different leaders, including Captain Cutter, Professor Anders and the Covenant Shipmaster. Blitz is about as fast as you’d imagine it would be. Matches go fairly quickly. The majority of my newbie matches lasted only five minutes. It’s a frantic fight to control zones and score points.\nOnce you’ve got a number of cards earned from completing the tutorials (which I recommend you do either way, because troop management is impossible without understanding everything in those tutorials) and completing the campaign’s missions, building the decks is a ton of fun. You’re constantly cycling through your deck, similar to Clash Royale . For instance, you only need to have one Marines unit card in your deck, but it’ll come into your hand multiple times during a game. Any duplicates that you receive through opening up the Requisition packs are counted toward levelling up that specific troop or vehicle. Some cards have keywords that modify base units and lend them special powers, like Siphon or Reflect, which makes them more expensive than the vanilla versions, but all the more valuable in battle.\nBlitz took a couple of successful multiplayer models, from Halo 5: Guardians Warzone and Clash Royale , and made a fast-paced, slightly frustrating, but entirely enjoyable experience that continues to keep me on the edge of my office recliner. The matches are short enough that “just one more” is often the mantra of the evening.\nHalo Wars 2 is captivating, but mechanically flawed Halo Wars 2 is a playful, well-rounded RTS experience that manages to be enjoyable despite its control issues and fiddly gameplay mechanics. With RTS games enjoying a small upswing after a number of years on the sidelines, Halo Wars 2 is a refreshing (though frustrating) departure from the norm. The campaign’s conclusion was unsatisfying, but the overall narrative arc was absolutely worth playing through. And now, it’s the promise of a good Blitz match that’ll keep me going back for more.\nAmanda Farough has been writing about video and tabletop games for a number of years.
