About 500 anti-Trump activists marched through the downtown area, some smashing store and car windows, hurling trash cans into the streets, and fighting with police in riot gear—who, in turn, unleashed pepper spray and stun grenades.\nZACH GIBSON/AFP/Getty Patrick Smith/Getty Mario Tama/Getty Some protesters wore masks and kerchiefs over their faces and carried signs, including one that read, “Make racists afraid again.”\nOthers took part in peaceful protests, including 35-year-old Jessica Reznicek, a Catholic aid worker from Des Moines, Iowa. She told Reuters: “The message I want to send is that Trump does not represent this country. He represents the corporate interests.”\nKiana Wilkerson, 20, from Williamsburg, Virginia, was among those protesting Trump just outside the inauguration.\nShe told PEOPLE, “I’m here to let Trump know that we’re resisting him and that he’s not good for our country. He’s taking us a step back for our rights.”\nAnother protester, Yiran Zhang, 22, from Chicago, shared with PEOPLE her message to President Trump: “Don’t forget about treating people like people. Remember that women are people. Remember that Muslims are people. Remember that black people are people. Remember that minorities, marginalized people, LGBTQIA people are people. All of these groups who have been certainly marginalized are people and it’s your job to protect them.”\nAhead of Friday, tens of thousands were expected in the city, according to NBC News . On Tuesday, the National Park Service told NBC that 22 permits for First Amendment events on park service land had been provided. This land includes both the White House and the National Mall.\nThese registered groups range in size from 50 people to 200,000 participants. Only protests over 25 people must have a permit, though.\nMike Litterst, a public affairs officer of the National Mall and Memorial Parks, further told NBC that in years past, only around six applications for protest permits were received for inauguration weeks.\nAnnounced inauguration day protests included an Act Now to Stop War & End Racism Coalition #InauguratetheResistance mass protest at the Navy Memorial, which started at 7 a.m.\nRELATED VIDEO: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Assault \nThe must publicized protest, however, is set for Saturday. The Women’s March on Washington is expected to draw up to 200,000, including numerous celebrities .\nBeginning at 10 a.m., participants are expected to march down the intersection of Independence Avenue and 3rd Street.\nOfficials said in a statement, “The Women’s March on Washington aims to send a message to all levels of government and the incoming Presidential administration, that we stand together in solidarity and expect elected leaders to act to protect the rights of women, their families and their communities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:00:14.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
