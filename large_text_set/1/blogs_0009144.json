Her red gown is Golden Globes pure perfection and it is everything we would want to see on a best dressed list and more.\nThe 27-year-old actress, who won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama last year for her role in Room , is back at the awards as a presenter this year and we are oh, so glad.\nWe know Larson is not playing any games, and she is here to work the room based on the outfit she’s wearing because it’s nothing short of amazing. Getty Images / Frazer Harrison Her gown has just the right accents to hug her body and keep it classy with gorgeous accents. The decision to keep her hair down in loose curls gives her pure old-Hollywood flavor and the matching dark red lip ties it all together.\nGetty Images / Frazer Harrison We’re totally in love with this look and looking forward to another year of Larson on the big screen.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:19:45.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
