Reuters/Phil McCarten \nHenrik Fisker, a legendary car designer and controversial figure in the auto industry, is gearing up to reveal his next sports cars. \nFisker staged his comeback January 2016 when he unveiled the Force 1 at the Detroit Auto Show â€” a stunning $270,000 supercar that can reach 60 mph in just 3.9 seconds. \nFisker is best known for his involvement in the initial design phase of the Tesla Model S before breaking off to start his own hybrid car company, Fisker Automotive, that ultimately went bankrupt in 2012. \nFisker debuted VLF Automotive with the Force 1. The company was originally called VL Automotive to refer to Gilbert Villarreal, a bespoke engineer based in Detroit, and Bob Lutz, who held executive positions at BMW and Ford. The added F refers to Fisker's role in the company. \nNow VLF Automotive is planning to reveal its next car, an F1 Roadster with an all carbon fiber exterior. Like the Force 1, the new Roadster will come with a V10 engine that offers 745 hp. The Roadster can reach a top speed of 210 mph and accelerate to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds, VLF claims. \nThe F1 V10 Roadster was designed by Fisker himself and will undergo a limited production run at VLF's facility in Michigan. The car will make its official debut at the Shanghai Auto Show that opens to the public April 21. \nFisker is also looking to launch an electric car that uses revolutionary new battery tech to achieve a range exceeding 400 miles. Fisker has said he plans to reveal the car in the second half of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:09:52.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
