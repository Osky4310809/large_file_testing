SLU is currently next-to-last in the Atlantic-10 standings, and owns an overall record of just 8-16. \nAfter winning back-to-back games for just the second time this season, Saint Louis saw its momentum stuffed Wednesday night in the form of a 70-55 road loss to St. Bonaventure. After the game, the team somehow managed to be dragged to an even lower state of mind when they discovered that their team bus had taken off without them. \nInsult to injury...\nLose to Bonnie's and our nutty bus driver leaves without the team!\nThe state troopers are tracking her down!\nSerious!\n— Bob Ramsey (@RammerSTL) February 9, 2017 35 years in division one and this is a new one.\nIt's like jerrys mechanic taking his Saab and holding Kennedys golf clubs hostage.\n— Bob Ramsey (@RammerSTL) February 9, 2017 Just chilling in the Reilly Center while we try to find our missing bus. #SCNotTop10 pic.twitter.com/Au9LwpofO1 \n— SLU Men's Basketball (@SaintLouisMBB) February 9, 2017 Things then got even weirder when the bus driver apparently refused to stop after she was tracked down by state troopers. \nThe cooky runaway bus driver has been stopped by the state troopers about 30 miles from Olean. The lady reportedly wouldn't stop at first\n— Earl Austin Jr. (@earlaustinjr) February 9, 2017 New York staties grabbed our rogue bussy after highway chase.\nGoing to crime scene to get our s@&t!\n— Bob Ramsey (@RammerSTL) February 9, 2017 The good news for Saint Louis is they their next two games will be played at home. The Billikens don’t hit the road again until a Feb. 18 trip to Fordham. It’s safe to assume they will have a more thoroughly vetted bus driver once they arrive in New York.
