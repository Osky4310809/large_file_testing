Clarke (@RepYvetteClarke) January 14, 2017 \nTennessee Democrat Steve Cohen detailed the reasons he wouldn’t be attending. \n“I would love to attend the inauguration. I’m a member of Congress through your votes. Thank you,” Cohen told WMC-TV in Memphis. “I value our government. I appreciate it greatly. This president semi-elect does not deserve to be president of the United States. He has not exhibited the characteristics and the values that we hold dear.” \nCalifornia Rep. Ted Leiu also chose to stand with Lewis. \n“For me, the personal decision not to attend Inauguration is quite simple: Do I stand with Donald Trump, or do I stand with John Lewis? I am standing with John Lewis,” Lieu said in a statement released by his office. \nHowever, the president-elect’s team doesn’t seem affected by the negativity. Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer even offered up the empty seats. \n“We’d love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don’t, we’ve got some great seats for others to partake in,” Spicer on a Tuesday morning call with reporters. “It’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power.” What do you think?
