It is a time to drink. But not just any beer. \nDougherty and others will be raising glasses for the debut of Makin Noise: A Pussy Riot Beer, an imperial saison made by female brewers from five local breweries to stand in solidarity with community members who they fear may lose their rights under the new presidential administration. \n“It stems from a place of being not happy with the election results and feeling the need to take action and do something to create positive energy,” Dougherty said. \nDougherty, who is a brewer at the Grateful Gnome Sandwich Shoppe and Brewery, spearheaded Makin Noise as a personal project with Kelissa Hieber, a brewer at Goldspot Brewing Company. The two posted their intentions on Facebook and a group of female brewers and beer enthusiasts has coalesced around the project. \nFive breweries signed on to the project and each has its own version of the Pussy Riot beer. They picked the imperial saison because “they look really light and delicate but they pack a punch and will knock you on your ass,” Dougherty said. \nThe brew isn’t about President Donald Trump, or even the election, but Dougherty said she understands that given the release date, the group’s intention might be misconstrued. Really, she said, the beer is about supporting people in the community, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, race, religious views or immigration status. \n“As we have learned, it has gotten spun a lot as an anti-Trump beer when, in reality, it’s more pro-community, pro-helping-our-friends-and-family beer,” she said. “(We’re) using our art to create positive change in our community and stand up for those whose rights are being threatened.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:05:48.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
