White House official: \"Most of these attacks did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources.\" https://t.co/fjYZw4lWtL — Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) February 7, 2017 \nTwo of the attacks that \"did not receive adequate attention\" occurred in New York City, and were in fact covered by DNAinfo New York: last year's Chelsea bombing, and a 2014 attack on NYPD officers in Jamaica by a hatchet-wielding man. \nHere is some of our coverage of the two incidents: \n2014 HATCHET ATTACK \nZale Thompson, 32, attacked a group of rookie NYPD officers — striking one in the head and another in the arm — before being gunned down by police on Jamaica Avenue in October 2014. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Thompson was depressed, reclusive and inspired by Islamic terror groups. \n\"I'm very comfortable that this was a terrorist attack ,\" Bratton said then. \nOfficer Kenneth Healey , 25, was struck in the head by Thompson's hatchet. He recovered from his injury in a Nassau County rehabilitation center. \nHealey's injury brought to light issues regarding the NYPD's pension system. If he had not been able to return to work, he would only have been eligible to receive a disability pension worth $27 a day . This issue, exclusively reported by DNAinfo, inspired police and elected officials to work toward reforming the pension system. \n► READ MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:26:48.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
