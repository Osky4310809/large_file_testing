CR7 completes clean sweep \nMessi, meanwhile, generated £23m through deals with Adidas, EA, Gatorade, Audemars Piguet, Gillette and Tata Motors. \nThose healthy returns place the iconic duo ahead of the rest of the football field, with Barcelona ace Neymar making £18.9m and Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale £9m. \nRonaldo and Messi only sit eighth and 11th respectively, though, on the list of the most marketable personalities in sport. \nRoger Federer, the winner of 17 Grand Slam titles, tops the chart on £49.2m, just ahead of NBA superstar LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. \nGolf icons Phil Mickelson (£41m), Tiger Woods (£36.9m), Rory McIlroy (£28.7m) and Jordan Spieth (£26.2m) all sit inside the top 10, along with tennis aces Novak Djokovic (£27.9m) and Rafael Nadal (£26.2m) and basketball powerhouse Kevin Durant (£29.5m). \nMaradona disappointed in Messi \nRonaldo is not too far adrift of the top five – with Durant currently perched in fifth spot – and his exploits over the course of a productive 2016 will have helped to make him even more appealing to potential sponsors. \nHe can expect to have Messi breathing down his neck, but given that the pair have spent the best part of a decade competing alongside each other on the grandest of stages, Ronaldo should be well accustomed to that by now!
