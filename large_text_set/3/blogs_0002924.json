Sean Lennon finally gave peace a chance, settling a $10 million lawsuit over a rotting tree with his Greenwich Village neighbors who are actress Marisa Tomei’s parents.\nThe details of the agreement are confidential but Gary Tomei told The Post that the 60-foot ailanthus tree finally came down last month after two years in court.\n“I’m just happy it’s over,” Tomei said.\nRoots from the diseased tree had cracked the Tomeis’ W. 13th Street stoop, crept into their basement and even compromised their foundation, according to the suit filed by Gary and his wife Addie.\nTomei added that he’s going to have his stoop, the surrounding balustrades and an exterior door rebuilt.\nA Manhattan Supreme Court judge had ordered Lennon to cut down the tree immediately in September after finding that it was a “nuisance,” but the Beatles scion filed an appeal.\nLennon had argued that his next-door neighbors should alter their entryway to accomodate the tree.\nHe later dropped the appeal. His attorney declined to comment.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:55:35.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
