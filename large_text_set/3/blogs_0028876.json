Destiny 2 is coming. \nHot on the heels of the leaked retail poster last week , Bungie has officially confirmed Destiny 2 with a simple tweet featuring key artwork from the game that matches up with the previous leak. \nThe image confirms the artwork from that leak and now makes one of gaming’s most obvious secrets properly official. \nJust recently it was confirmed that Destiny characters wouldn’t carry over to the sequel , while some cryptic comments on an Activision Blizzard earnings call seemed to suggest that a PC release was likely for the sequel. It’s also worth noting the now-confirmed retail leak made mention of a PS4 beta for the game, too. \n— Destiny The Game (@DestinyTheGame) March 27, 2017 \nWe’re now clearly not far from hearing more about all of this. It’s official – now we await more news. We’ll post it as it breaks, as always. All signs from previous leaks point to Destiny 2 being a 2017 game.
