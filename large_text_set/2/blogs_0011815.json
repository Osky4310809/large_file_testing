The Huskies hammered that home on Monday night by winning their 100th consecutive game, outlasting No. 6 South Carolina 66-55 in Storrs.\nUConn only led by six points at halftime, but pulled away in the third for another easy victory. Junior wing Gabby Williams was the star of the night with 26 points, while teammate Napheesa Collier chipped in 18 points. The win moves the Huskies to 25-0 this season.\nUConn hasn’t lost since Nov. 17, 2014 when it was defeated by Stanford. The Huskies’ unbeaten start is even more impress this year when you consider the players they had to replace.\nBreanna Stewart, Morgan Tuck and Moriah Jefferson led UConn to four national titles in their four years in school, then proceeded to go 1-2-3 in last summer’s WNBA draft. UConn didn’t start the year at No. 1 in the presason polls (the Huskies were No. 3), but it quickly became evident that a new starting lineup was fully up to the challenge of carrying on the program’s great tradition.\nThe Huskies have four games left before starting postseason play and will be the favorite entering the NCAA tournament once again. UConn is going for back-to-back undefeated seasons. There is nothing else in sports that can compare to the Huskies’ dominance right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:12:50.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
