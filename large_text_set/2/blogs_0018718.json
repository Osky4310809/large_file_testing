If you also struggle with this, allow me to introduce you to a sweet solution: small-batch desserts. \nSmall-batch desserts, like this recipe for matcha tiramisu for two, are the answer to your \"I want something more than a square of dark chocolate, but less than a three-tiered chocolate cake\" dilemma. They're also great for using up bits and bobs of baking ingredients you have lingering in your pantry and fridge. \nTo make this fun twist on tiramisu, first you'll need to brew some matcha tea: Whisk together honey and hot water and then slowly whisk the honey water into a bowl filled with matcha powder until it's completely combined. Next you'll need to whip up the mascarpone filling: Mix mascarpone, sugar, egg yolks, heavy cream, salt, and a bit of the matcha tea in a stand mixer until light and fluffy. \nWhen you're ready to assemble, you dip the lady finger cookies into the matcha tea first and then layer them on the bottom of your serving dish of choice. Spoon over some of the mascarpone filling, and then add another layer of matcha-soaked lady fingers. Continue layering the mascarpone and lady fingers until each serving dish is full (ending with a smooth layer of mascarpone on top). After chilling the tiramisu in the fridge for at least two hours (overnight is ideal, though), you dust the tops with a mixture of powdered sugar and matcha powder. \nThe author of this recipe chose glasses for her serving dish, but she notes that you can also use mugs or small casserole dishes — use whatever tiny vessels you have on hand! \n→ Get the Recipe : Matcha Tiramisu for Two from A Cozy Kitchen More posts in Delicious Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:07:04.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
