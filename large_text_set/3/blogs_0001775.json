Abu Sayyaf extremists in the Philippines have released a video of the beheading of Kantner. The brief video circulated Monday, Feb. 27, by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi websites, is the first sign that the brutal militants proceeded with their threat to kill Kantner in the southern Philippines after a Sunday ransom deadline lapsed. SITE Intel Group via AP \nMANILA, Philippines — Muslim members in the House of Representatives including officials of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao condemned the beheading of a German national by the Abu Sayyaf Group. \nThe group, tagged as a terror organization by the United States, recently released a video showing the beheading of 70-year-old Juergen Gustav Kantner by a masked militant with a curved knife. \n\"These acts of terrorism are not in accordance with Islamic region or way of life to which we as representatives of our people here in the Philippines belong,\" the Muslim lawmakers said in a statement released Wednesday. \nThe lawmakers stressed that the Muslim community does not consent to, encourage or support \"brutal barbaric acts\" done to any innocent person. \n\"We hope that as we band together to make this condemnation, our people will be spared from unfair generalization or unfounded discrimination,\" the statement read. \nThe lawmakers called on all Muslims to pray so that the Bangsamoro region will be protected from the effects of terrorism.   \nKantner was kidnapped almost two months ago while he and his partner, Sabine Merz, were cruising through the Philippines in their yacht. \nMerz was killed when she tried to fight back with a shotgun. Villagers later found her body on the yacht off Laparan Island in Sulu. \nThe Abu Sayyaf earlier threatened to execute Kantner if the P30 million ransom was not paid. The Philippine government, however, has a no-ransom policy as the money given to the militants could be used to fund further criminal activities. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has condemned the \"abominable act, which shows once again how inhumane and without conscience these terrorist act.\" — Patricia Lourdes Viray  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:26:02.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
