(Source: PTI) \nThe Election Commission of India has given green signal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s radio broadcast of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ according to the news agency Press Trust of India despite the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand. \nThe show came under scrutiny after the Election Commission’s Code was applied with polls being held in several states and union territories. However, Prime Minister will be very careful with his words and will not be able to take up any political issue or discuss any government initiative on his show. \nYou may also want to watch: \n\nThe first episode for 2017 will be broadcast on Sunday i.e. January 29 and will focus entirely on students.
