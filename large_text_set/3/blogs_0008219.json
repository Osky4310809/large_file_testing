That is of course John Surtees' greatest feat, one that will be fondly remembered with the news that he has sadly passed away aged 83.A statement from the Surtees family says that he was admitted to St Georges Hospital in London last month with an existing respiratory condition. Surtees is said to have passed away peacefully this afternoon after a short period in intensive care.\n\"We deeply mourn the loss of such an incredible, kind and loving man as well as celebrate his amazing life. He has set a very real example of someone who kept pushing himself at his peak and one who continued fighting until the very end\" continued the statement. \nSurtees enjoyed his greatest success through the 50s and 60s, winning his 500cc bike World Championships in 1956, 1958, 1969 and 1960. He made his F1 debut at the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix; his first podium came the race after, taking second at the British Grand Prix. He joined the Yeoman Credit Racing Team in 1961, then the Bowmaker Racing Team in 1962, before becoming a Ferrari driver in 1963. In 1964 he won the F1 Drivers' Championship behind the wheel of a Ferrari 158. \nHe raced until 1972, also competing at Le Mans and in Can-Am, before retiring to run his own race team and, eventually, a bike shop and car dealership. As all-round racing talents go, he will rightly be remembered as one of the greats; \"figlio del vento\" was his nickname at MV Agusta, or son of the wind. Our thoughts are with the Surtees family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T05:57:43.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
