If you don't believe what everybody believes, this is like '30s Germany.\"\nIn response, the Executive Director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, Steven Goldstein , said in a statement published on Facebook :\n\"Tim, have you lost your mind? No one in Hollywood today is subjecting you or anyone else to what the Nazis imposed on Jews in the 1930s -- the world's most evil program of dehumanization, imprisonment and mass brutality, implemented by an entire national government, as the prelude for the genocide of nearly an entire people. Sorry, Tim, that's just not the same as getting turned down for a movie role. It's time for you to leave your bubble to apologize to the Jewish people and, to be sure, the other peoples also targeted by the Nazis.\"\nThe center followed up on Tuesday: \nYou can watch Tim's full interview, where he talks politics and Americans' privacy (below)!!\nWhat do YOU think about Tim's comments ??
