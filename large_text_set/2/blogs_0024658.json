Agreeing on the proper etiquette for how to share the new type of post will likely take some time.\nIn the meantime, regardless of whether you think albums are going to ruin Instagram, there are a number of circumstances when the feature will be useful, if not welcome.\nMake albums, not spam Like them or not, Instagram's new feature could go a long way toward addressing what might be one of the most widespread pet peeves on the platform: people who post too goddamn much.\nWe all know at least one person who shares a little too often.\nWhether it's your elementary school bff, an older relative or a clueless coworker, we all know at least one person who shares a little too often.\nAnd while this is accepted, or even encouraged on other platforms like Facebook and Twitter, it has long been an unspoken rule of Instagram that, unless you're Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez or a Kardashian, you shouldn't post too frequently or you'll risk losing followers.\nNow, instead of being that person who must share their 10 favorite shots from their cat photoshoot/wine tasting/ski trip on the same day (ugh) you can add them all to a single post.\nNote that for now, Instagram only allows you to add a single caption and location for a whole photo set, so it's probably best to use a group of related photos to avoid confusion unless you want an excessively long caption.\nBut, aside from grouping together your wedding, vacation or other event photos, there are a number of types of posts that could greatly benefit from the new format.\nRecipes and food Perfect for food bloggers and foodies, albums will make it much easier to share recipes, particularly more complex ones. Rather than trying to condense an entire recipe into a single post or video, you can use a few images to lay it out step-by-step.\nA post shared by LALIQUE | HEALTH √ó WELLNESS (@laliquekae) on Feb 22, 2017 at 4:09pm PST\nEven if you don't post recipes, but you love snapping your meals, albums could be a nice way to group shots from the same meal together so your followers don't all have to see multiple shots of everything you ate that day.\nTutorials and DIY Similarly, any post that details any kind of tutorial or DIY process could benefit from an expanded view with multiple images. Whether it's a makeup tutorial, decorating or some other project, more explanation is always better when it comes to any kind of step-by-step guide.\nA post shared by Amrah ‚Ä¢ üíç (@thebeautyelite) on Feb 22, 2017 at 1:05pm PST\nExercise and fitness Whether it's before and after shots, #fitnessinspo , yoga poses or exercise routines, albums could be a boon for fitness bloggers and enthusiasts who love to share very detail from their gym time.\nCombine multiple exercise videos into one long tutorial, or exhaustively detail your post-workout nutrition regimen.\nA post shared by Fairlane Vicente (@upbeatevolution) on Feb 22, 2017 at 5:09pm PST\nVacation pics Please for the love of God: put your vacay pics in an album if you don't plan on posting your FOMO-inducing shots sparingly. Those of us who are stuck at work will thank you.\nA post shared by Diego Salinas (@diegosalinas) on Feb 22, 2017 at 4:52pm PST\nFamily and pets As much as people love to overshare when it comes to their babies and fur babies, not all of your followers want to see multiple variations of the same photo many times a day. Now, instead of choosing one, you can simply group related photos into one post and spare those of us who would rather move on.\nA post shared by hajidah musyayyadah (@jidah.hajidah) on Feb 22, 2017 at 5:18pm PST\nLikewise, those who can't get enough of the cute babies and silly kitties can get even more than before since you no longer have to question how much is too much.\nIt's win-win.\nBONUS: Drone captures mesmerizing footage of water overflowing in a portal-like 'Glory Hole'", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ1d0mthztA/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ1A2uclr2M/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ1a1hHAXv2/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ1cwU5DBR0/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/a4GVjMmk.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/a4GVjMmk.m3u8", "https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/fitnessinspo/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ1V1nOjRGv/"], "published": "2017-02-23T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:36:14.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
