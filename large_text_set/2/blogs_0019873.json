For example, his ex wrote that he never cheated on him to which he wrote, “Strong statement. No supporting details to support your hypothesis.”\nNeedless to say, his ex did not receive a good grade. Lutz gave the letter a 61 percent grade, or a D-minus.\n“Need to stop contradicting your own story and pick a side,” he wrote after the final grade. “While this gesture is appreciated, I would prefer details over statements. Revision for half credit will be accepted. Good luck.”\nLutz, whose Facebook says he is a business marketing major, told the BBC that his ex wasn’t pleased that he shared the letter on social media.\n“She’s not the happiest but I didn’t expect it to go viral,” he said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:17:18.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
