While the party—and the affections of the crush—might be all in her head, Who’s cheeky attitude and the song’s catchy hook will latch easily onto listeners’ imagination.\n“Some Kinda Wonderful” is the third single off of Who’s upcoming album The Valley , out later in March. Check it out above, and just try not to start bopping along. Bonus: the next laundry day is already looking up.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:44:54.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
