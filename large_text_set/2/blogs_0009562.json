Arnold said that Clinton asked him to release a video of Donald Trump from \"Celebrity Apprentice\" that showed Trump using derogatory terms for African Americans and women.\n\"Hillary Clinton called me two days before the election and said, ‘Please release that,'\" Arnold said. \"The weight of the free world is on your shoulders.\"\n\"Hillary Clinton called you up?\" Hussain asked.\n\"Yes, and I said, ‘I–let me think about it, but I'd love to be a hero, but I can't hurt these families,'\" Arnold said.\nThe actor added that he believes even if the tapes were released before the election, Trump still would have won.\nArnold has known Trump for about three decades but supported Clinton during the election.\nIn October a tape emerged of Trump making vulgar comments about women while behind the scenes for \"Access Hollywood.\" Many commentators thought at the time that the release of the tape would be a near fatal blow to Trump's campaign, but a month later, he upset Clinton to win the White House.\nThe post Tom Arnold Says He Received Desperate Call From Clinton Before Election appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:42:45.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
