If you can plunk down at least $4,500 a night, that is. The Kailua Bay, Oahu home, called Plantation Estate at Paradise Point , measures 6,000 square feet, and has five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms, plus a hot-tub spa, fitness center, gourmet kitchen, lagoon-style pool, and, of course, beautiful views. It's located in a gated community and features \"celebrity-style\" security, according to its website description. The estate sleeps up to 10, so you can think of it as $450 a person if you need to justify the splurge.The Obama family stayed at the home while vacationing in Hawaii from 2008 to 2011, and many other celebrities have stayed there as well. The property manager, Glenn Weinberg, provided R29 with a few celebs' entries into the estate's guestbook, including this from President Barack Obama: \"My family and staff have grown very fond of our time at your home, and your generosity is much appreciated.\" For photos of the estate (and more celebrity quotes), click ahead.
