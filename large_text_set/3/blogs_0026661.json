Iniesta is maybe going to be in the first team for two of three more years and with the quality and technique that Coutinho has got it would be a brilliant time for the team [for him to join].\" \n'Coutinho has lost his magic' \nBarca’s interest in Coutinho intensified after seeing the 24-year-old make a bright start to the 2016-17 campaign. \nAn untimely injury halted his progress and he is still searching for that level of consistency since returning from an ankle complaint. \nHe has, however, managed seven goals in all competitions for Liverpool and remains a key figure in Jurgen Klopp’s plans.
