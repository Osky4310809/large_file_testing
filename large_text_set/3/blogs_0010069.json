From the looks of the recently released trailer, this movie has the potential to become one of our new favorites.\nFanning voices the lead role, Félicie, but she’s not your average “princess.” Félicie and her friend Victor (Nat Wolf) are orphans in a remote French village. While she dreams of moving to Paris to become a ballerina, Victor has dreams of being a world-famous inventor.\nThey set off to Paris to realize their dreams, but it’s not as simple as it sounds. It wouldn’t be a Disney movie without lots of absurd shenanigans and life-lessons, and the two have their fair share of both. Félicie must pretend to be from a wealthy family to gain acceptance to a prestigious dance school, and Victor struggles to make his inventions work.\nOf course, her lack of professional training and grooming makes her stick out. But her raw talent impresses her teachers and classmates. She comes face to face with a devious mean-girl, bent on ruining her chances at succeeding at her dream.\nFanning isn’t the only famous voice you’ll recognize. Dance Moms star Maddie Ziegler joins the cast as the antagonist dancer. Carly Rae Jepsen voices Odette, Félicie’s mentor and teacher. In addition to voicing the character, Jepsen also contributes original music to the soundtrack.\nLook out for #LeapMovie stars @natandalex & @maddieziegler at the @nickelodeon #kidschoiceawards tonight at 8pm ET|PT! Until then, here's a sneak peek at the brand new poster! \nA post shared by Leap! (@leapthemovie) on Mar 11, 2017 at 2:16pm PST \nThe soundtrack is going to be pretty epic as well. Sia and Demi Lovato join Jepsen with new music, and it’s looking like a must-download.\nMaddie and costar Nat Wolf debuted the new trailer at the Kids’ Choice Awards. The movie, which was originally titled, Ballerina is directed by Eric Summer and Éric Warin. It opens in theaters April 21st.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T18:31:26.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
