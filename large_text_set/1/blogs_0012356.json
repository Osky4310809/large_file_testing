King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted a day ago 8 Mark Tremonti and Myles Kennedy recently discussed their approach to guitar tuning on the latest Alter Bridge record \" The Last Hero ,\" explaining how they spiced it up a bit in this department.Myles tells Guitar World : \"We definitely experimented a bit. For instance, if Mark was playing something that seemed to have a tonal center of G, I might tune to open G, which is not something I normally do.\"Tremonti chimed in: \"We definitely used a lot of tunings we have never used before - some pretty standard, like D-A-D-G-A-D, and others more out there, like B-F#-C#-F#-B-D.
