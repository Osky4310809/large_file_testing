ADVERTISEMENT \nAfter relying heavily on Ray Parks early in the tournament, Alab coach Ronald Mac Cuan has seen Jeric Fortuna, Lawrence Domingo and JR Cawaling step up in the last two games against the Slingers and Westports Malaysia Dragons. \nBut Cuan said the showdown with the Long Lions will be a gauge of how well his team is playing at this point of the season. \n“It’s a big game for us because Hong Kong is up there in the standings,” said Cuan, who hopes to squeeze out better games from imports Sampson Carter and James Hughes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:19:19.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
