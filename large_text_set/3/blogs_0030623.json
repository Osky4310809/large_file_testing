Given the unfavorable conditions, not to mention the possibility of not even qualifying for next year’s Champions League, it seems likely that Alexis will leave the club in the forthcoming transfer window. This provides a very favourable scenario for any club looking to pounce on the opportunity of adding a brilliant player such as the Chilean international to their squad. Sure enough, according to the Guardian’s Fabrizio Romano, this is exactly what Chelsea are set to do, making Alexis the club’s \"no. 1 target\" for the summer. Chelsea were made the bookies’ favorite back in December already for Sánchez’s future signature, but this is the first actual rumor regarding any such intent. Earlier this month, the Guardian also claimed that a “rival club” have already made a “massive offer” . Romano’s latest report claims that PSG, Juventus, and Inter Milan also remain interested in Alexis, while at Chelsea, he’d be just one part of a massive summer transfer outlay, which, if Conte’s wishes are to followed, could include an upgrade at the left back position. The Chelsea boss, who’s also set for a significant pay rise, has apparently requested either Bayern Munich's David Alaba or Juventus' Alex Sandro. Not bad! In addition to potential additions to the squad in attack (Lukaku or Morata?), in midfield (Bakayoko?), and in defence (Van Dijk?), world class reinforcements like Alexis or Alex Sandro could certainly make for an exciting summer in the SW6.
