The Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro will be among the first Chrome OS devices that are able to run Android apps from the Google Play Store out of the box.\nThe only hardware difference between the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro is that the Plus has a ARM-based hexa-core OP1 processor, while the Pro has an Intel Core m3 chip. Both models boast a 2400×1600 resolution display that can rotate a full 360 degrees, and both feature 4GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. The two models will also arrive with two USB Type-C ports and both will ship with a built-in pen that’s tucked away on the side of the device when not in use. The Chromebooks will come pre-installed with the Google Keep app for note taking and Samsung ArtCanvas for drawing.\nSee also: Four more Chromebooks can use Android apps on Chrome OS Developer channel November 17, 2016 However, the fact that both of Samsung’s new Chromebooks will come with the Google Play Store pre-installed may be the biggest feature. Google has so far only updated a small selection of its Chromebooks to run Android apps, via Chrome OS updates, since mid-2016. Hopefully this means we can expect to see more Chromebooks supporting Android apps, both new and existing, in the near future. However, we should note that Samsung points out that the Google Play Store support for the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro will be in beta form.\nThe Samsung Chromebook Plus will go on sale in February for a price of $449. The Chromebook Pro has a more general “Spring” release time frame, but the price tag has yet to be revealed.\nThe article originally appeared on TabTimes.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:17:06.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
