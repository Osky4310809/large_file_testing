If Repsol and Armstrong deliver on their projections, North Slope oil production could see a significant boost, he said. \n“If the economics of producing this find is favorable and can stack up well against shale plays, this is great news for Alaska,” said Sarp Ozkan, manager of energy analytics at Drillinginfo Inc. in Littleton. “Alaska production has been on the decline for a long time and any economic find that can mitigate or reverse these declines will be a boost to their energy sector.” \nBill Armstrong, president and CEO of Armstrong Oil, told The Oil & Gas Conference hosted by Enercom in Denver last August that the latest unconventional discoveries can’t overcome the depletion of conventional reserves. \n“We’re living off the inventory found in the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s,” Armstrong told the audience. By the end of this decade, production from those sources will not be enough to match demand, even if you include technically recoverable tight oil,” he said. \nOil production in Alaska has largely concentrated offshore, and the potential of onshore areas remains largely untapped. Respol has been looking for oil onshore since 2008 and Armstrong started drilling exploratory wells in 2011. \nRepsol holds a 25 percent working interest in the Horseshoe discovery and a 49 percent working interest in the nearby Pikka Unit. Armstrong, currently the operator, has the rest of the working interest.
