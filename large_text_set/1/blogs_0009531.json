Those parties included a unit called GM Plumbing and VITRO, which won the review for an account that was worth $27 million in 2012.\nThe MDC Partners shop has now released its first creative work for the brand with the help of director David Gelb , who helmed the excellent 2011 doc “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” and the consistently good (if you’re into that sort of thing) Netflix series “Chef’s Table.”\nLike his previous work, this one is all about culinary authenticity that comes “Fresh From the Grill.” It’s also got a bit of that L.A. flavor—no, not the Golden Globes kind.\nBrothers Jake and Victor Camozzi , who joined VITRO last February to launch its Austin office, led creative on the campaign.\n“It’s a new direction,” Jake said regarding the new work. “In the past they were a little more comedy-based, but this is a lot more documentary-style and anthemic. They are a legitimate brand with a great heritage and history that’s part of the fabric of L.A.”\nThe chain, which initially started in Mexico, opened its first California location in 1980 and now includes 400 such branches. “It started with one place on El Dorado Street with one guy cooking really good chicken,” Camozzi said, “and we wanted to bring it to life as almost a love letter to the city.”\nVictor Camozzi said that the agency thought of Gelb as an ideal director for the campaign: “As soon as we jumped on the phone he said, this is directly in my wheelhouse,” Camozzi said, “shooting food in a way that looks real but not like the visual tropes of other food shooters out there.”\nJake adds that the history of the company “made our job really easy” and that the team also collaborated with Jorge R. Gutierrez , an illustrator who created the mural that plays a prominent role in the above spot and directed the 2014 animated film The Book of Life.\nMy father taking a picture of the @elpolloloco mural.

Gutierrez (@mexopolis) January 4, 2017\nThe Camozzi brothers told us that future spots will delve deeper into the Pollo Loco story, and VITRO will also be handling social media for the client, though that work is still in development.\n“There’s no denying the immense influence that the vibrant personality and character of LA has had on El Pollo Loco, and it became clear to us our campaign needed to tell this hometown story,” said VITRO CEO Tom Sullivan. “We’re proud to debut ‘Road to Authenticity’ which highlights the quality and authenticity of El Pollo Loco through a beautiful and enticing travelogue showcasing exactly what inspires everything they do and have done for over 30 years.”\nIn the meantime, here are two more recent :15 spots.\nNow order online!\nCREDITS\nChief Creative Officer: John Vitro ECD’s: Jake and Victor Camozzi Creative Director: Joel Guidry Account Executive: Alex Deme Account Executive: Stefanie Meehan", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ElPolloLoco", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tL6fmJwLprw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKS9eYJEz54", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRYeD1j3BPk", "https://t.co/0virhqP0aq", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MexicanFather?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/mexopolis/status/816456222790426624"], "published": "2017-01-10T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:17:05.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
