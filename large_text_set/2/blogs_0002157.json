Francis Escudero. GEREMY PINTOLO \n  Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II is not entirely innocent in the corruption scandal involving the Bureau of Immigration (BI) and online gaming mogul Jack Lam, according to Sen. Francis Escudero. \nAs far as Escudero is concerned, Aguirre was only cleared by retired police general Wally Sombero of any wrongdoing in the P50-million bribery scandal through a text message. \nThe senators, however, have yet to hear from Sombero himself, he said. \nEscudero said there are still many questions that remain unanswered in the entire caper, particularly on Aguirre’s role as the superior of the BI officials caught receiving the bribe from Lam. \nHe questioned why Aguirre met with Sombero and Lam at a hotel when they were discussing work-related matters and why he did not just delegate the task to Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente in meeting the businessman. \nEscudero said there was clear indiscretion on the part of Aguirre when he agreed to meet with Sombero and Lam at the hotel instead of his office at the DOJ.   \nHe also recalled how Aguirre came up with a price tag for himself when he aired his belief that if he agreed to the bribe he would have gotten P100 million a month. \n“He thinks that was his price. As if he had the impression that was his price as justice secretary. The price of P50 million is cheap, maybe P100 million would settle it. Is that how he thinks it is?” Escudero remarked. \nAt this point, Escudero said he is not ready to come up with any conclusions about Aguirre’s guilt or innocence because he wants to see the entire picture first. \n“But the committee can make a recommendation insofar as any criminal and/or administrative sanctions that can be imposed on them. But bear in mind, he’s an alter-ego of the President. Only the President can administratively sanction him, not the Senate,” he said. \nEscudero added an independent probe into the incident should be conducted by either the police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) or the Office of the Ombudsman in order for the results to be acceptable to the public. \nHe said the fairness and objectivity of a probe by either the DOJ or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) would be questioned because the two agencies are both under Aguirre.
