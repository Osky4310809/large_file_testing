Now, aspiring writers hoping for that same distinction will be able to write in the author’s personal library thanks to a new initiative by the Mark Twain Museum . The museum recently announced they will open up a handful of slots this year for wordsmiths to work uninterrupted in Twain’s library for up to three hours at a time. \nAlthough writers cottages abound around the world, it’s quite rare for a museum to open historic spaces for public use. However, in this case, the museum is paying homage to Twain’s love for the Hartford house, where he wrote some of his most famous works, including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . \nSlots are limited, with only four nights available throughout 2017. Lest those participants think they can show up with a fifth of whiskey and a quill, those who reserve spaces will be held to some strict rules. The reservations will be for a maximum of three hours and there is no wifi. Plugs are “few and far between,” so laptops should be fully charged before entering. And about that quill? Sorry, no ink allowed, only pencils are permitted in the historic house . \nDespite the restrictions, the event is geared to the hope of inspiration, “Participants will have the house to yourselves,” a note on the library’s website states. “Feel inspired by the beautiful sounds of the fountain in the family conservatory; rest your eyes upon Twain’s bookshelves as you ponder your next word.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T14:43:29.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
