Well, the writers at All India Bakchod - Supriya Joshi, Anuya Jakatdar, Manaswi Mohata, and Ayesha Nair – have scripted a pleasantly explicit video, starring parts of a woman’s body that most would rather not talk about. \nThis is a story about a girl, Priya (played by Mallika Dua), who is joined on her exasperating journey of a pregnancy test by besties, Vagayanti (vagina), Clitika (clitoris), and Geeta Boobita (a certain Ms. Anu S. making a guest appearance). Amid the oh-so-relatable confrontations, Vagayanti is called out for being goddamn moody, and when matters get a tad heated, Clitika steps in as the ultimate peacemak-aaaah! \nOther moments where Priya is seen stroking Clitika, while reading Fifty Shades of Grey, or taking off her bra causing the conjoined twins, Getta and Boobita to suddenly droop are far too real to ignore. \nThere is only one verdict – this video is hilarious AF.
