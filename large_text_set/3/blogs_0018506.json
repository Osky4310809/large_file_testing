Abi Morris was in Spain for the Foxes' game against Sevilla (Photo: Getty) \n“It was pure brute force. There was an older fan with his daughter and they just pushed into him. \n“He fell over and landed hitting his head on the pavement with such force. How he didn’t crack his head open I do not know. \n“My instinct was to help him but when I did one of the police officers grabbed me with a baton round the throat and dragged me into the middle of the street.” \nThe sales worker, who had been watching the match in the pub with her mum while her brother and father went to the game, said: “It was horrible.” Abi watched Leicester's 2-1 defeat in a pub with her mum (Photo: Michael Regan) \nShe said she believed they came looking for a fight. \n“There was no way I was going to give them a fight,” Abi said. “I weigh less than eight stones but that didn’t stop them.” \nThe incident was caught on camera by another Leicester fan Ryan Flowers. \nHis footage shows Abi screaming as she is manhandled by the officer.

My mum went up to the senior officer to ask for help. \n“I was worried I was going to get worse.” \nHelp eventually arrived from the Spanish owner of a nearby hostel who came out to assist Abi, as the fans and the police left the scene.

There might have been some bits of trouble with fans but not where we were.” Abi's dad described the behaviour of police as \"out of proportion\" (Photo: REUTERS) \nHe said: “They were just animals and if they are allowed to carry on like that one day they will kill someone. \n“They were violent towards a young woman with a heart condition who was no threat to them whatsoever.” \nMr Morris has written to his MP Alberto Costa to raise the matter. \nThe South Leicestershire MP has responded to say he will take the matter up with the Foreign Office.
