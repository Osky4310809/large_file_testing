Earlier this month, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, estimated that more than 10,000 people have been killed in the war so far, with many of them the victims of air strikes.Saudi Arabia’s UN Ambassador, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi, flatly denied responsibility, saying the coalition - which includes Gulf states such as Qatar and Kuwait - was \"exercising maximum restraint and rigorous rules of engagement.\" The panel also stated that the alliance admitted that some of their airstrikes resulted in severe casualties, which was not the desired outcome. \n\"In some cases errors were acknowledged and responsibility accepted. Corrective measures including compensation to victims were taken,\" the authors of the report wrote.

Yemen was already one of the region’s poorest states before the current crisis, but according to the UN, 14.1 million people - over half of the population – are “food insecure,” and over two-thirds require humanitarian assistance, due to internal displacement, lack of medical supplies and clean drinking water.Despite the devastating conclusions of the latest UN report, the US and UK, which are not directly taking part in the bombardment and blockade of Yemen, have avoided directly criticizing Riyadh, a longtime ally. \"We urge all sides to take steps to prevent harm to civilians. Ending the conflict in Yemen requires a durable cessation of hostilities and a comprehensive political solution,\" the US State Department said in a statement. \nREAD MORE: Women of Yemen call to arms against Saudi aggression (VIDEO) \nThe British mission to the UN, while refusing to comment on the specific incidents mentioned in the report said, \"We take reports of alleged violations of international humanitarian law by actors in the conflict very seriously.” Both the US and the UK have been major suppliers of arms to the Saudis. In September 2016, Reuters reports, the US Senate cleared the way for a $1.15 billion sale of tanks and other military equipment to kingdom. Saudi Arabia has also been buying arms from the UK – with estimated purchases at some 3.3 billion pounds. That includes more than 2.2 billion worth of warplanes, helicopters and drones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T00:39:51.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
