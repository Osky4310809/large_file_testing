He hit the big shots and at the same time, shut down Hotshots’ main man Paul Lee. \nLee was super in leading Star to victory in Games 1 and 2, but he found his kryptonite in Mercado in the last five games of the series. \nIn Game 7, Mercado forced Lee, who never hit double digits from Game 3 onwards after averaging 17.5 points in the first two games, into his worst game of the series with only four points on 2-of-8 shooting from the field. \nZero: Aldrech Ramos Aldrech Ramos.Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRE R.net \nMuch was expected from Aldrech Ramos and the veteran forward failed to live up to it. \nRamos was a vital piece for Star this conference but he was a non-factor in the semifinals against Ginebra. \nWith Allein Maliksi, who was also considered for this infamous recognition, playing inconsistently, the Hotshots badly needed Ramos to step up and provide what he’s known for which is his outside shooting. \nBut Star couldn’t get anything from its floor-spacer. \nRamos did have 14 points and four 3-pointers in Game 7 but the Hotshots would have appreciated it more had he showed up in the first six games of the series. \nX-factor: Jervy Cruz and Joe De Vance Ginebra’s Jervy Cruz. PBA IMAGES \nJust when Ginebra seemed out of it, Jervy Cruz channeled his inner Growling Tiger and Joe Devance played through excruciating pain from a plantar fasciitis on his left foot to inspire the Gin Kings. \nCruz had a memorable Game 3 where he scored 21 points, coming just two points shy of matching his career-high, while Devance made the most out of his limited playing time, doing just enough to give his team a much-needed lift. \nTurning point: \nGinebra looked like a beaten team after Star took a 2-0 lead. \nBut that was before Devance, in pain and all, suited up in Game 3 to boost the Gin Kings. \nGame 3 was also the start of Paul Lee’s decline in numbers with Sol Mercado locking him down all the way to Game 7 where the Hotshots guard was silenced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:30:22.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
