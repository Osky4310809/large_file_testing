By Joe Starkey / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nOn the bad mornings, college basketball’s highest-profile video coordinator wakes up unable to control his right leg. It might be the shakes. It might be nerve pain doing wind sprints through his thigh. So he waits for it to subside, pulls himself together and attacks the day. \nHe always attacks the day. \nNever mind the four rods and six screws holding his lower back together or the ongoing intestinal issues that cost him part of his colon. Ron Everhart is rarin’ to go. He had to relinquish his official title of “assistant coach” after that brutal, 6½-hour back operation Jan. 6 — that’s why he is the team’s self-described video coordinator at the moment — and he dreaded the long flight to San Jose for Thursday’s West Region matchup against top-seeded Gonzaga. But you live with these things when you’re headed to the Sweet 16. \nYou live with these things when you are part of a staff that has a very real chance to deliver the state of West Virginia its first national championship (in basketball or football). And nobody has to tell a man who grew up a half-hour from WVU Coliseum worshipping a pit bull point guard named Bob Huggins what that would mean. \n“For the people of West Virginia, families like mine who grew up here, it would mean everything,” Everhart said late Sunday, as he broke down Gonzaga video and rooted for one of his former assistants (South Carolina coach Frank Martin) against Duke. “We have people out there, season-ticket holders from Wyoming County or Charleston or other places making 2½-, 3-hour drives to our games. West Virginia athletics just galvanizes everyone. It becomes a way of life. \n“Huggs tells a story that when they went to the Final Four in 2010, the governor called and said, ‘We have a real problem: All the miners are not going to work because they’re watching the games.’ Huggs says, ‘Why in the hell don’t you get ’em a TV in the mines?’ Well, I think it was Joe Manchin at the time, he got with the coal industry, and they had TVs put in the coal mines. Everybody went to work and watched. \n“That’s the type of people we have here.” \nIt’s easy to root for the loquacious Everhart, a Fairmont, W.Va., native who unfortunately starred in one of the most confounding sports stories I have covered in a quarter-century of covering sports. \nYou might remember the gist of it: “Duquesne Fires Winning Basketball Coach,” a headline not unlike “Man Attacks Lifeguard Who Rescued Him.” \nThe Dukes had 20 losing seasons in 21 years before Everhart produced a winner in 2007-08. He then gave the school its first back-to-back winning seasons since 1981. He got it to within a game of its first NCAA tournament since 1977. He posted five consecutive seasons with at least a .500 record. \nAnd then he was fired. \nBy Duquesne! \nI asked Everhart if he still finds that fact unfathomable. If part of him still thinks the Dukes were bluffing. \n“The more time moves on,” he said, “the more difficult it is to get my head around it.” \nHe didn’t want to go into detail on who or what caused his ouster in 2012. Suffice to say, he won’t be starting a fan club for former Duquesne athletic director Greg Amodio anytime soon. \nRemember the “internal” memo that leaked out of Duquesne’s administration just after the firing? Everhart sure does. \n“I couldn’t even get fired like a regular coach,” he said. \nIf you’re up for a laugh, here is an excerpt … \n“[Everhart] has stalled at a modest plateau with our program,” wrote then-Duquesne president Charles Dougherty, who by “modest” must have meant “miraculous.”“It is clear that we will not be capable of moving to the next level of excellence with Ron at the helm. By next level, I mean annual contention for the top of the A-10 conference, regular appearances in the NIT and periodic appearances in the NCAA tournaments.” \nDuquesne’s record since that moment: 60-97. \nEverhart, now 55, left with mixed memories, but he loved his players, often favoring the frenetic style Huggins employs. And if he stays forever with Huggins, eight years his elder, Everhart would be thrilled. But he’d like one more head coaching gig. He owns a 273-261 record from stops at McNeese State, Northeastern and Duquesne. \nNobody will outwork Everhart, a man Huggins referred to recently in the Fairmont Times as “the toughest guy I know.” \nThe feeling is mutual. When Everhart’s father would take him to West Virginia games, they would watch one player more than the others. \n“My dad was a former coach and just loved the way Bob Huggins played,” Everhart recalled. “He’d say, ‘See that guy right here? That’s who you need to be like.’ I never forgot it.” \nHuggins urged Everhart to get the back surgery in August. Everhart put it off. By the end there was no disc at the base of his back. Just bone on bone. He figures it was an old basketball injury, aggravated by weightlifting. \nDespite the pain, life in West Virginia truly is almost heaven for Everhart. He is able to spend quality time with his parents, both in their late 70s, siblings and other relatives. He is needed. \n“It’s been really good,” he said. “I can’t tell you how good.” \nA win Thursday, and it’ll be that much better. \nThree more after that? \nYou don’t even know. \nJoe Starkey: jstarkey@post-gazette.com and Twitter @joestarkey1.
