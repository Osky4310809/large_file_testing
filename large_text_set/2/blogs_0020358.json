Their work in Boston Public Schools shows it’s an important part of the classroom experience. \nSecond graders at the Eliot School in Boston use the Lego kits in robotics class. \n“We have to make a railroad crossing gate,” one student said. “We have to make it go up and go down.” Students at the Eliot School use Legos in robotics class. (WBZ-TV) \nAnd they’ve got the basics of engineering – down. \n“So the load over here, the pivot right here, and then the effort is over here,” another student said. “You have to have those three things.” \nTeacher Huijing Wu worked as an engineer but left industry to work in education. She teaches robotics to kindergartners through eighth graders and calls these Lego kits a valuable tool.

Now they have programs in over 200 Boston-area schools taking a familiar toy and making it part of the important STEM curriculum. \n“That’s part of the magic of Lego Education where we’re bringing the core brick from the toy group or from what kids experience at home into the education environment,” said Ken Yanhs, Marketing Director for Lego Education. Students at Eliot School use Legos in robotics class (WBZ-TV) \nWhere the familiar interlocking blocks give kids the freedom to try and try again. \n“Failing is OK,” Yanhs says. “And the fact that they actually get to collaborate and talk and that sharing of ideas is super important.” \n“And we talk about when your project fails it doesn’t meant that you’re a failure, it just means this is an opportunity for you to figure out what went wrong and try again,” Wu said. \nKen also pointed out Legos can also be a tremendous equalizer in a classroom where English is a second language and for special education students. \nFrom LEGO Education : “LEGO Education has a variety of products and at different price ranges. Our goal is to first work with the school to determine what learning outcomes they hope to achieve for their students and then we help them determine the best solution, which can include in-person training.” Paula Ebben Follow Award-winning journalist Paula Ebben co-anchors WBZ-TV News at 5:30PM and WBZ-TV 8PM News on myTV38 with co-anchor Liam Martin.
