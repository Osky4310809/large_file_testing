Photo: Reuters/Beawiharta 0 \nAnother flag-related issue has been raised in relation to the rallies organized by hardline Islamic groups in Indonesia over the past few months. Not long after the authorities arrested a man for carrying an Indonesian flag modified to feature Arabic writing , now officials from the Palestinian Embassy in Jakarta are seeking to distance their country from the controversial rallies after several Palestinian flags were seen being held up by protesters. \nIn an official statement as picked up by BBC Indonesia , the embassy wrote that it “regrets to observe recently that the Palestinian flag had been raised during non-peaceful rallies connected with purely Indonesian domestic affairs,” and that “True and genuine friends of Palestine should be keen to preserve peace and stability in their own country if they are sincere about achieving peace in Palestine, therefore, the Embassy expresses its confidence that the Indonesian people cannot be deceived by any misguided individuals or groups who might use our Flag to cover up their ill-intended hidden domestic agenda.” \nSari Amalia, the embassy’s representative, told BBC Indonesia that they have observed that their flag was used in Islamic groups’ rallies towards the end of 2016 and in 2017. However, the embassy did not specify exactly which groups were responsible. \n“Like other embassies, we have a commitment not to intervene and not be involved in Indonesian domestic affairs,” Sari said. \nEmbassy officials said they hoped their flag would not be used in other rallies. \nThe Palestinian flag was often seen in demonstrations spearheaded by the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) and the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI) against Jakarta Governor   Purnama over his alleged blasphemy. More recently, the green, white, black and red flag was also seen during FPI’s protest over the supposed “criminalization” of their leader, Habib Rizieq, in Jakarta. \nFPI Jakarta secretary general Habib “Fitsa Hats” Novel said their group is ignoring the Palestinian Embassy’s statement, telling JPNN , “Let them protest. We’re sure the Palestinian Embassy doesn’t represent the voice of the people of Palestine.” \nIndonesia enjoys strong diplomatic relations with Palestine -- Indonesia being one of the first countries to recognize the struggling Islamic nation as an independent state. Considering that, it’s hard to imagine hardline Indonesian Muslim groups calling for boycotts of Palestine ( just like some of them did with bread maker Sari Roti after the company sought to distance themselves from involvement in recent rallies by Islamic groups). But we’ll just have to wait and see how they react to this latest rebuke.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T07:58:28.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
