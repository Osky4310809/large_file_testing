Within the hour, Burgess arrived and helped run the under-12s session \n\"When I tweeted Christian, I didn't think anything would come of it,\" Chitty, coach of Skilful Soccer Youth in Portsmouth, told BBC Radio Solent. \n\"I hadn't seen his initial reply that he was actually coming as I'd started the training session.
