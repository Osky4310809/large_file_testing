  \nRarely has a player's career at a club been so defined by one moment, let alone that moment being a corner, than Iago Aspas's one fateful season at Liverpool. \nThe Kop end at Anfield on April 27, 2014, was meant to witness Liverpool's relentless charge to a first league title in 24 years. \nInstead, they saw Steven Gerrard slip, a classic Jose Mourinho defensive rearguard action from Chelsea and Liverpool's title dreams dashed. \nHowever, if Gerrard could be pardoned as a living legend, then Aspas's decision to play a corner along the ground only to a grateful Willian just before he scored Chelsea's second with Liverpool pressing for an equaliser saw the Spaniard ridiculed and quickly exiled from Anfield. \nNow, back at home at Celta Vigo, the 29-year-old is outgunning the likes Neymar, Antoine Griezmann and Karim Benzema as one of La Liga's hottest strikers.

Aspas struggled at Liverpool (Photo: Getty) He is remembered for one fateful corner against Chelsea (Photo: Getty) \nThe turnaround in Aspas's fortunes is not simply thanks to a return to Spain. \nAfter leaving Liverpool he spent a largely frustrating year on loan at Sevilla. \nHaving watched on as Daniel Sturridge, Luis Suarez and Raheem Sterling tore Premier League defences apart in 2013/14, Aspas was primarily a spectator the following season as Carlos Bacca and Kevin Gameiro carried Sevilla to another Europa League. \nAspas needed a home, and found one back at home. The club he joined as a kid, has supported ever since and, with hindsight, probably should never have left. \nRather than feeling jilted, he was received back at Celta as a hero. \nHe returned for half the price he left and with the money they got for him they signed Nolito before cashing in too when he left for Manchester City in the summer.

Aspas battles Neymar (Photo: Getty) \nIt took 13 months for Barca to concede four in a game again and again it was an Aspas-inspired Celta who did it in a thrilling 4-3 win earlier this season. \nCelta are riding the crest of a wave not just due to Aspas's goals, but also in large part to Eduardo Berizzo's cunning management. \nThey face Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 32 of the Europa League in their first European campaign for a decade and will make the Cup semi-finals if they can finish the job in the second leg of their tie against Madrid next week. \nThree-time runners-up in the Copa del Rey, Celta have never won a major trophy. \nIf they were to finally win it thanks to the goals of Balaidos' prodigal son, even the most hardened cynic would fail to be enchanted by the romance of the Cup. poll loading Should Liverpool have kept faith with Iago Aspas? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T20:29:27.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
