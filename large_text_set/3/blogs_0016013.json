One law enforcement source told NBC News that the victims’ bodies were so charred that police had to use dental records to identify the men. According to TMZ , DePaola’s son Chris regularly drives the car, but was taken to the airport by a friend last week. Though he was supposedly told not to drive the car, it appears that Chris’ friend did and has not been reached since the incident occurred. A post shared by Kim DePaola (@kimdposche) on Mar 19, 2017 at 12:18pm PDT DePaola herself seeming confirmed the reports on Sunday, posting a message to Instagram. “I am humbled by the outpour of love and support during this very difficult time. My son and I are both safe. Our deepest condolences go out to the victims’ families of this truly horrific tragedy,” she wrote. For more from the RHONJ cast, watch the clip below.
