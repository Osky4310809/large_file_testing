Any videos, promotions come out of your budget. Endorsements, tour and merchandise, they finger-fuck it, You make like 35 cents off of each ducat. I own my masters, bitch, independent, So for every sale I do, you gotta do like ten. Stop comparing yourself to Jay, you not like him, You a motherfucking worker, not a boss like Rem! \nBut deſpite the uncharacteriſtic versifickation on MATTERS POLITICKAL , Miss Ma quickly return’d to more Familiar Fancies in the remainder of her ſong, excoriating HER RIVAL for ſupporting her brother in his ſtruggles with the law . \nMiss Minaj reſponded with her Characteriſtic Pugnaciouſneſs , poſting a ſcreenſhot of Miss Ma’s Unimpreſsive Record Sales , which ſhe deleted anon.
