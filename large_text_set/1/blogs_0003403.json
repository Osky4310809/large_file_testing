(Andrew Kragie/Houston Chronicle) Deputies shoot gun-wielding man inside Cypress hospital ER 1 / 6 Back to Gallery \nAn emergency room patient apparently tired of waiting to see a doctor was shot by off-duty sheriff's deputies after he opened fire with a pistol inside the hospital. \nThe 21-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in critical condition but is expected to recover, according to Harris County sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Cedrick Collier, who added that the man remained combative. \nThe incident happened about 8:45 a.m. at North Cypress Medical Center at 21214 Northwest Freeway near Huffmeister in the Cypress area. \nThe man left his waiting room and fired shots into the ceiling, sending receptionists scrambling under their desks, Collier said. \nHe then went outside toward a medical center and shopping area, but the two deputies confronted him about 40 feet outside the emergency room doors. They commanded him to drop the weapon, but he turned and pointed it at them, Collier said. Both deputies fired their weapons, striking him several times. \nNo other injuries were reported. Related Stories Man shot at St. Joseph files suit alleging excessive force and negligence \n\"We're very lucky today,\" Collier said. \nA high-risk team deployed in case of multiple shooters. He credited the deputies' quick reaction with preventing more violence. \nThe spokesman said one of the deputies has worked 10 years with the sheriff's office and the other three years. Both will be placed on paid administrative leave, as is standard after an officer-involved shooting. \nPolice said investigators have not yet spoken with the suspect, who does not have a criminal history and likely will face charges that could include assault with a deadly weapon. \nAccording to hospital officials, the man arrived at the facility about 8 a.m. saying he needed an X-ray. A nurse evaluated him and walked him to a waiting room, where another nurse and a doctor also evaluated him, the hospital said in a statement. When he was asked to take off his clothes for examination, he refused and left the room. \nA hospital courtesy officer followed him. Then the man began to run. He went to the ambulance bay of the emergency room, pulled out a gun and fired a shot, according to the hospital. No one was wounded. \nAfterward, he ran through the lobby and out of the facility. That's where deputies confronted him and fired their weapons, hitting the man four or five times in the legs and torso, Collier said. Homicide investigators and crime-scene technicians gathered evidence in the area, using at least 20 evidence markers to indicate shell casings and other items of interest. \nThe hospital complex largely had returned to normal by noon Tuesday as patients checked in to a neighboring outpatient clinic and employees stopped by a coffee bar just feet away from a bullet hole in a window. A window near the North Cypress Medical Center emergency room apparently was struck by a bullet during a police confrontation with an armed patient Tuesday morning, Jan. 3, 2017.
