If you use a different browser for different reasons, you can use this little tool to switch which one is the default. You can even schedule a time for the default browser to switch. For example, if you work in Safari during the day, but your child works in Chrome for school purposes in the evening, you can schedule the browser to switch from one to the other every day at a certain time.\nYou can also use a few customizable settings that make your browsing experience better, like opening a new window from a link in the background. So, if you're reading your mail, you can click on a link and it will open up behind the mail app, so you don't get interrupted by the browser.\nYou can even set up Browserism to open certain websites in certain browsers. For example, when I use Hangouts, I always open Chrome. Whenever I open a Hangouts invite, it always defaults to Chrome, even if my current browser is Safari.\nIf you use different browsers throughout the day, Browserism will speed up your productivity exponentially.\n$1.99 - Download now \niStat Menus 5 \niStat Menus is a system monitoring tool that sits in your Menu bar and keeps you abreast of everything that's going on with your Mac.
