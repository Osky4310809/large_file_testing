But there are always exceptions to the rule, and in the case of the Nokia 3310 , it’s not hard to see why. Nokia’s mobile phone business is making a long-awaited comeback thanks to its licensing deal with HMD Global, so it makes sense that along with the new phones, the indestructable 3310 also rises from the ashes, so to speak. The new 3310 is a new and improved version of its predecessor, and while it draws plenty of inspiration from the original – you’ll see why at first glance – there are several new additions to help it adapt to the modern age. Among these are a 2.4-inch colour display, a 2MP camera with LED flash, dual-SIM and a micro-USB port for charging. The new 3310 is also much thinner and sleeker than its predecessor, but still manages to pack in a 1,200mAh battery that Nokia claims will provide 22 hours of talk time and over a month of standby time. The phone also comes with an SD card slot for expansion by 16GB, an FM radio and an MP3 player. Oh, and in case you were wondering, it features the iconic Nokia ringtone too.There’s no 3310 without Snake, and you’ll be pleased to know that the new version comes with the popular game – albeit a modern version. The OS itself is pretty barebones – you get an improved version of Nokia’s old Series 30 operating system – and this time there’s a built in Opera browser too in case you feel like doing a quick web search or even accessing Facebook in a pinch. Your options to access the internet though are quite scarce, given that the 3310 is a 2G only device (if you were hoping for a VoLTE-enabled variant that would work with Jio’s network, you might be in for a disappointment).The Nokia 3310 is available in a range of punchy colours like red, blue, yellow and a more staid grey. It’s priced at €49 (~Rs 3,456), which is pretty steep when you consider the many entry-level smartphones available for cheaper. But Nokia isn’t aiming to enter the price game with the 3310. It’s a phone that very much plays on the nostalgia factor, and we can see many users pick one up just for old times sake. It’s also worth mentioning that the 3310 has a lot of potential in a market like India, where over 50 percent of mobile phone users still use a feature phone. Nokia’s brand recall is still very strong in India, and with HMD planning to take an offline approach with the brand, it could end up being a relatively successful device. HMD hasn’t yet clarified exactly when the 3310 will be launched in the country, but we do have a tentative date of Q2 this year. We’re interested to know your thoughts on the Nokia 3310. If it is priced around the Rs 3,500 mark, would you be interested in buying one? Do let us know in the comments section, and stay tuned to 91mobiles for all the action happening at MWC 2017.
