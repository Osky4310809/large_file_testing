Watch Marko Marosi's fantastic save from Matt Clarke's header \nAt the other end, Niall Mason dragged a shot wide before Marquis was again left free in the box and this time headed against the woodwork. \nBut Portsmouth improved as the half wore on and they levelled in the 41st minute when Jordan Houghton gave the ball away in midfield and Kyle Bennett slipped it through for Naismith to finish past Marosi. \nThe game continued to look in the balance early in the second half before Rowe restored Doncaster's lead just before the hour mark. \nThe hosts worked the ball forward with a slick passing move and Rowe fired home from just inside the box. \nDoncaster extended their advantage in the 71st minute when a cross from the left was coolly volleyed in by Marquis. \nPortsmouth continued to battle and substitute Milan Lalkovic headed at Marosi, who had to be stretchered off minutes later with injury. \nBut despite late pressure and seven minutes of injury time, the visitors could not find a way back into the match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:07:29.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
