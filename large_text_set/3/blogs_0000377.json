I don't know whether you've ever heard that or not,\" the Berkshire Hathaway executive asked CNBC's Becky Quick. Business Insider spotted the problematic comment.\n\"Well, if a diplomat says yes, he means maybe. If he says maybe, he means no. And if he says no, he's no diplomat,\" Buffett continued. \"And if a lady says no, she means maybe. And if she says maybe, she means yes. And if she says yes, she's no lady. So he [Kraft Heinz chairman Alex Behring] probably got a maybe [from Unilever] and didn't know whether it was coming from a diplomat or a lady, essentially.\"\nThere are a lot of things wrong with that analogy. First, what about a lady diplomat?\nSecond, if a woman says no, she means no. Buffett's line of thinking is one step removed from those \"no means yes and yes means anal\" fraternity chants .\nJolly Old Warren Buffett Dispenses Folksy Nuggets Of Wisdom Like ‘If A Lady Says No, She Means Maybe’ https://t.co/Tuu8tUOAna pic.twitter.com/nu65bh27rl\n— Maya Kosoff (@mekosoff) February 27, 2017\nAppalled by @WarrenBuffett choice of words describing takeover bid: \"If a lady says no, she means maybe\" https://t.co/ycH29KJFNM #NoMeansNo\n— Chiara Sottile (@CASottile) February 28, 2017\nAs billionaires go, Buffett has been a pretty progressive one. He is a committed Democrat and just this weekend seemed to subtly criticize President Donald Trump in a letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.\nBuffett has also advocated for women-owned businesses and women executives at his own company. A recent HBO documentary followed how Buffett became one of the most successful investors in history. His company backs Kraft Heinz, which offered $143 billion for Unilever in early February.\nBut even with the best of intentions, it seems the 86-year-old billionaire has internalized — and now spread — some harmful messaging about women and consent along the way.\n\"Old stories\" – check them for signs of rape culture before repeating.\nBONUS: There's a very good reason stars wore blue ribbons at the Oscars", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/WarrenBuffett", "http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/becoming-warren-buffett", "https://twitter.com/mekosoff/status/836315550460559360", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/5N8k9cgz.m3u8", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmagoldberg/2016/06/15/warren-buffett-advocates-for-women-in-business-at-white-house-summit-on-women/#7845d1731161", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/08/texas-tech-frat-no-means-yes_n_5953302.html", "https://t.co/nu65bh27rl", "http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/27/buffett-talks-up-stocks-and-his-apple-stake-bashes-bonds-hedge-funds.html", "https://t.co/ycH29KJFNM", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/5N8k9cgz.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMeansNo?src=hash", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/business/dealbook/kraft-heinz-unilever-merger.html", "https://t.co/Tuu8tUOAna", "http://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-on-negotiating-women-and-sex-2017-2", "https://twitter.com/CASottile/status/836380977131728900"], "published": "2017-03-01T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:22:30.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
