Door fault: The buses have been recalled for a software update (Picture: Glenn Copus) \nFlorence Eshalmi, Labour London Assembly spokeswoman for Transport, said: “Just when you think it can’t get any worse for the Routemasters here we have yet another example of the previous Mayor’s vanity project costing Londoners dear. Ticket office staff will not join Tube strike, union says \n“An ‘eco-friendly’ bus that ended up running on diesel, and a ‘hop on hop off’ service that was too expensive to manage. \n“Sauna like conditions in the summer that led to windows being replaced, and now rear doors that can open without warning when the bus is moving. \n“This really is beyond farcical. \n“I am pleased Mayor Khan has already announced no more of these overpriced vehicles will be purchased, but I will be raising the issue of any public costs associated with the latest recall at Transport Committee in City Hall this week.” 'Vanity project': The buses were introduced by former Mayor Boris Johnson (Oli Scarff/Getty Images) \nBut Gareth Powell, TfL’s director of strategy and contracted services, told the Standard that Wrightbus would be carrying out the update and it would not cost TfL anything.
