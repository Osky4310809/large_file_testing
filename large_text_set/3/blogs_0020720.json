Since then he has won five Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2008. \nHe became United's leading scorer when he scored his 250th goal for the club in the 1-1 draw at Stoke City in January. \nRooney has said the only Premier League clubs he would play for are United and Everton. \nWest Ham are planning on spending big money in the transfer window this summer. Top of their shopping list are a proven international-level striker and a right back.
