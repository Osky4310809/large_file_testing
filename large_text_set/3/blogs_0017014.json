The two examples spotted on a trailer bear French registration plates, and are likely to be left-hand drive units sent here for training and evaluation purposes. \nThe newly-crowned European Car of the Year is expected to make its Malaysian debut sometime in the second quarter of the year , and we will be getting variants equipped with the 1.6L THP 165 S&S and a six-speed automatic transmission. \nTrim levels haven’t been announced for our market, but it’s likely Nasim will be selling the car in its Allure trim level, which is that worn by the spied units. The latter sits midway in the five trim levels available for the car, with the GT Line and GT placed above it. \nPricing – even indicative – still hasn’t been intimated, but as reported last year, it is expected to progress on from the RM159k asked for the first-gen facelift . Buyers can expect a swanky interior, dressed up with new premium materials and trim, and fronted by a visually stunning i-Cockpit dashboard. \nKey items include a high-resolution, configurable 12.3-inch display screen that makes up the instrument cluster, a centrally-mounted eight-inch touchscreen and six elegant piano-key toggle switches that offer direct and access to the main control functions (radio, climate control, navigation, vehicle parameters, telephone and mobile applications). \nNo word on specifications for the MY model, but there’s a panoramic sunroof and a hands-free tailgate available for the 3008, and the options list also includes a 10-speaker Focal Premium hi-fi audio system and a Driver Sport Pack. Whether the latter duo makes its way here remains to be seen. \nEarlier in the month, the 3008 was crowned the 2017 European COTY , garnering 316 points from the judging panel to finish ahead of the Alfa Romeo Giulia (second place, 296 points) and the W213 Mercedes-Benz E-Class (third, 196 points). \nGALLERY: Peugeot 3008", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T09:24:13.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
