He chose Ohio State over Oklahoma and Florida State. \nThough his commitment to Ohio State was widely expected, Okudah's importance to Urban Meyer's class cannot be understated. \nRated the No. 1 safety and the No. 7 overall player in the 2017 recruiting class in the 247Sports composite rankings , Okudah is now the top-rated player in the Buckeyes already-deep class. \nNow that Okudah is officially in Ohio State's class, this will be the best recruiting class in Buckeyes history -- at least on paper. Ohio State has seven verbal commitments from five-star prospects in this one class. It had six total five-stars in the previous five classes. \nOhio State had two other defensive back targets announce their decisions in the U.S. Army game, five-star Darnay Holmes of Calabasas, Calif., and four-star Bubba Bolden of Las Vegas (Nev.) Bishop Gorman. Holmes picked UCLA and Bolden chose USC. \nThe Buckeyes now have 18 commitments in their 2018 recruiting class, which is No. 2 overall in the country in the 247Sports composite team rankings behind only Alabama. The Crimson Tide, however, have 26 total commitments.
