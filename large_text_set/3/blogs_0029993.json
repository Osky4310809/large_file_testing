With just 0.526 miles of track, Martinsville is always claustrophobic, and that means lots of trading paint and lots of hot tempers. Here are some of the most memorable confrontations at the Virginia short track. Sporting News Sporting News via Getty Images 8 Tony Stewart vs. Kenny Irwin Stewart and Irwin had an intense rivalry dating back to the days when they both raced sprint cars and midgets in the Midwest. At Martinsville in 1999, the two took turns dumping each other during the early stages of the race. Irwin put Stewart into the wall and when the field was circulating under yellow, Stewart threw his heat shields at Irwin and then tried to punch him through the right-side window. 7 Carl Edwards vs. Matt Kenseth This was so bizarre. After the October 2007 race at Martinsville, Kenseth was being interviewed on SPEED when Edwards walked up to him, grabbed Kenseth with one hand and pushed him backwards with the other. As Kenseth was talking to him, Edwards raised and cocked his fist at Kenseth before finally walking away. At the time, the two drivers were teammates at Roush Fenway Racing.

Harvick then rubbed Biffle and when the two cars came into the garage, Biffle again tapped Harvick. The two drivers exchanged words in the garage afterwards. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR 5 Brian Vickers vs. Matt Kenseth It seemed like Vickers and Kenseth couldn’t stay away from each other at Martinsville in Oct. 2011, when they took turns wrecking each other throughout the day. Officially, Vickers’ No. 83 Red Bull Toyota was listed as being in four separate caution-flag periods. All told, the yellow flag waved 18 times in a very messy race. Getty Images Getty Images 4 Clint Bowyer vs. Hendrick Motorsports \nAs the field came to take the green flag for a green-white-checkered finish during the spring 2012 Martinsville race, it appeared that Rick Hendrick would get his 200 th NASCAR Premier Series victory, as the front row for the restart featured Hendrick drivers Jimmie Johnson and Jeff Gordon. But Clint Bowyer made an ill-advised dive bomb on the two leaders, wrecking them both and allowing Ryan Newman to steal the win. Gordon and Bowyer’s feud continued for the rest of the year, ending with a huge dust up in Phoenix. 3 Greg Biffle vs. Jimmie Johnson \nFollowing the 2013 Martinsville fall race, Greg Biffle wasn't pleased with Jimmie Johnson after he accused Johnson of rough driving that ripped the rear panel off Biffle's No. 16 Ford. While Johnson was being interviewed after the race, Biffle pulled him by his firesuit collar and started blasting him while the cameras rolled. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images 2 Kevin Harvick vs. Ty Dillon \nIn a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race at Martinsville three years ago, then-teammates Kevin Harvick and Ty Dillon got into it in a big way while racing for second. After the race Harvick, ripped Dillon, saying, “(That's) exactly reason I'm leaving RCR, because you've got those kids coming up that have got no respect for what they do in this sport and they've had everything fed to them with a spoon. … It's just a shame you have to get taken out by some rich kid like that.” Dillon called the incident “just hard racing.” Getty Images Getty Images 1 Matt Kenseth vs. Joey Logano Logano came into Martinsville with a three-race winning streak, including Kansas Speedway, where he dumped Kenseth to win, starting a huge furor that included NASCAR CEO Brian France calling Logano’s race-winning move “quintessential NASCAR.” But when Logano’s teammate, Brad Keselowski, wrecked Kenseth at Martinsville that was it. Kenseth got his car repaired and when he came back on the track, he drilled Logano into the wall, taking him out of the race and out of Chase contention. The move earned Kenseth a two-race suspension.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T17:14:39.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
