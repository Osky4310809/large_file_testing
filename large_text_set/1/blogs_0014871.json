Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJurgen Klopp has dismissed the critics accusing him of disrespect towards the FA Cup — and will again rest his star names. \nThe Liverpool manager is taking another youthful team to Plymouth for a third-round replay necessary after a shadow side that was the Reds' youngest EVER drew the original tie with the League Two club a fortnight ago. \nThat day, the German coach was roundly attacked for resting his entire title-chasing first team. \nHe was unrepentant at his pre-replay press conference though, insisting he loves the competition... even if he will do it again for the Wednesday tie that will decide who hosts Championship side Wolves in round four at the end of this month. \n“Usually I don’t speak about things I’ve done in the past but have a look on my cup record in the last few years. We were in 500 finals or something like this,” exaggerated the former Borussia Dortmund boss. \n“There was not one situation did you think, 'Oh, which team did he pick? He doesn’t want to be in the cup’.

I love playing in cup competitions. Everything is fine. \n\"If people want to think this, I cannot change it. If anybody thinks I don’t respect the cup, I cannot change.” \nCounterpart Derek Adams warned it will be same again from his team as they strive for one of the biggest shocks in the competition’s history, but Klopp is adamant he got it right selection-wise in the first game – and is not interested in the opinions of anyone else. \n“If anybody thinks out there that I don’t respect the cup you cannot imagine how little I’m interested in this opinion, even if it is a supporter or not,\" said Klopp. \n“I am responsible for this team and we have to play a lot of tournaments. If I think a player is ready for the next game he plays, if I think he is not ready he will not play. The two teams march into the arena for the initial tie...

The last game I had a lot of good reasons to line up why we did and that will be the same on Wednesday. \n“The main reason is we want to win and go through though.” \nKlopp’s biggest decision will be whether to play Joel Matip , with world governing body FIFA still refusing to say if they will take action should the Cameroon international appear. \nHis country say they will demand a punishment for Liverpool – which could even extend to being kicked out of the competition – should he be selected, because they wanted him to be available for the Africa Cup of Nations. \nKlopp though, argues Matip retired from international football 15 months ago and so any regulations covering the issue don’t apply. \nHe joked that plotting Brexit from the EU seems to be easier than exiting playing for your homeland.

But my understanding is that it’s a free world, and if you don’t want to play for the national team and have different reasons for it, then it should be possible,” added Klopp. \n“We can all makes decision. Whole countries can leave the EU and nobody can say ‘No, you can’t’. Obviously you can. \n“My dream — what we need is a letter. It’s clear that he is retired, but what we need is a letter from the official side of Cameroon that says 'the player is released and can play for Liverpool.'\" \nThe club must wait until Friday for FIFA to decide if there is a case to answer. \nIf they do, Matip could be banned from playing domestic football until mid-February — after the tournament in Gabon ends. poll loading Who will win the replay? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:10:53.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
