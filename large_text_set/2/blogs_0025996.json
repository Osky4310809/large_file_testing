Former Chancellor George Osborne is the architect of the giveaway (Photo: AFP) \nThis will rise again to £150,000 in 2019 and £175,000 in 2020 meaning an individual could hand on assets worth £500,000 and a couple £1million without paying any inheritance tax. \nFigures unearthed by Labour MP Rachel Reeves show the main winners will be in Tory-held areas . \nOf the 150 constituencies with the highest percentage of homes sold over the £650,000 threshold 135 were in London and the South East. \nIn Theresa May’s Maidenhead constituency one in five properties (640 or 20.1%) were sold for at least £650,000 in 2015-16, while in Chancellor Philip Hammond ’s Surrey seat of Runnymede and Weybridge 18.3% (679 properties) of homes were sold for at least £650,000. \nEducation Secretary Justine Greening’s Putney seat in London saw more than two thirds of homes (1,314 or 37.70%) go for more than £650,000. \nBy contrast in Ms Reeves’ Leeds West constituency only six properties sold for more than £650,000 in the last two years. Philip Hammond is facing calls to reverse the tax cut (Photo: Reuters) \nIn the Rhondda, south Wales, there were no properties sold for more than that amount, just two in South Shields, two in Ogmore, two in Kingston-upon-Hull North and one in West Bromich East. \nMs Reeves, a member of the Treasury select committee, said the inheritance tax cut was deepening the north south divide. \nShe called on the Chancellor to reverse the tax cut in next week’s Budget and use the money to pay for expanded childcare. \nShe said: “These new figures reveal the Government’s inheritance tax giveaway will only benefit a wealthy elite in London and the South East at the expense of the rest of the country. \n“One of the very few exceptions where people in the North will gain is the seat of the former Tory Chancellor George Osborne who came up with this unjust tax change. \n“ Philip Hammond should use his Budget to scrap this unfair and deeply flawed plan that will only deepen the North-South divide. \n“If he presses ahead with its introduction, it will show Theresa May’s skewed sense of priorities and prove that her claim to care about those who are just about managing is a total sham. Rachel Reeves says the money should go to fund childcare (Photo: Getty) \n“The Chancellor must scrap these proposed changes to inheritance tax and channel the money into early years childcare to give youngsters the best start in life instead of a pushing ahead with a regressive change that just decreases social mobility and entrenches division.” \nMr Hammond is reportedly looking to review inheritance tax in next week’s budget as a means of funding social care. \nA source said the Chancellor thinks it is “unfair” that wealthy people can build up property wealth and then pass it on to their children but expect the state to pick up the cost of social care.
