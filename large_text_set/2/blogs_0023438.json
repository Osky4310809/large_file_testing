Like Snapchat Stories (or, more fittingly, Instagram Stories), content lasts only 24 hours; you can mute specific users, and reply to people privately. \nWhatsApp\nWhatsApp debuted on Feb. 24, 2009, as a way to let family and friends know what you’re up to; folks could quickly push a line of text—”at school,” “at the gym,” or “battery about to die”—to all contacts at once. The service eventually expanded into a full-blown texting platform, with more than 1 billion users worldwide. \nThis isn’t the first time Facebook—parent company of WhatsApp and Instagram—has stolen a page from Snapchat’s book. After failing to acquire the ephemeral messaging service in 2013, Facebook simply duplicated its functions (and not very creatively) via Instagram Stories and Facebook Stories , and now WhatsApp Status. \n“Just like eight years ago when we first started WhatsApp, this new and improved status feature will let you keep your friends who use WhatsApp easily updated in a fun and simple way,” the company said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:47:48.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
