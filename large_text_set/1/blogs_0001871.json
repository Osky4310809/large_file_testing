AFP \nAt the security cordon outside Istanbul’s Reina nightclub, where a gunman went on the rampage killing New Year revelers, a man yells that he must get through, that he knows someone inside. \nA policeman puts an arm around his shoulder and holds the man as he collapses in tears. He is escorted away from media and police throw a jacket over his shoulders to keep him warm. \nAt least 39 people were killed, including many foreigners, in the bloodshed at the upscale nightclub in Istanbul’s Ortakoy district.

I have not been able to reach her since.” \n‘Don’t cry’ \nThe city had already been on edge ahead of the New Year, an obvious security risk after a string of attacks this year blamed on Kurdish militants and jihadists. \nAuthorities had boasted that 17,000 police would be on duty in the city for New Year. But their mass deployment could do nothing to prevent the horror unleashed by a single individual. \nFor another woman standing outside the situation is more certain. “My elder brother is inside. I had news. Thankfully he is fine. I am waiting for him now,” she said. \nShe reassures a relative on the phone. “Don’t cry. He is coming.” \nInside, police teams began painstaking forensic work to try and identify the attacker. \nAnother group of ambulances rushes through the security cordon and fewer then come through until a police officer declares there is no longer anyone inside the Reina. \nBut the security situation is far from over, as Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu announces that a manhunt is under way for the attacker. \n“The police have started the necessary operations. I hope (the assailant) will be captured quickly, God willing,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T13:44:41.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
