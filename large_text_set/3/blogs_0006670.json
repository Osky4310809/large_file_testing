Most Popular By Scott Christian Mar 10, 2017 Earlier this week, the Donald Trump brain trust tried to cash in on St. Patrick's Day by peddling an Irish-ed up version of the \"Make America Great Again\" hat. Rather than red, the caps come in bright green with gold lettering, and with an Irish shamrock embroidered on the back. They’re going to go fast—get ready for #StPatricksDay by grabbing a green #MAGA hat! https://t.co/wPor87vsDW pic.twitter.com/pk5pDHlzfJ \n— GOP (@GOP) March 3, 2017 Advertisement   Except that it isn't actually an Irish shamrock. It's a four-leaf clover. Which, if you're Irish, is something of a metaphorical kick in the teeth. You see, a shamrock actually has three leaves, with each leaf representing an element of the Holy Trinity. A four-leaf clover, on the other hand, is a mutation of the trefoil plant that superstitious people believe carries good luck. So if you're keeping score, the Trump camp's desire to profit off anything and everything, combined with a seeming inability to execute a basic Google search, has, in one fell swoop, insulted the Irish, the Catholics, the makers of Lucky Charms cereal (presumably), and basically anyone with a modicum of taste. Most Popular A link to the website where you can purchase the hats, which no longer works, was tweeted out by the GOP, and some of the responses to that tweet were pretty entertaining: @GOP @TeamTrump That's a four leaf clover, not a shamrock.
