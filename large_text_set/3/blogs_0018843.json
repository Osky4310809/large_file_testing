Amanda Bucci is a personality on Instagram that nearly half a million people get their workout motivation from, and her latest fitness post about a “bad” angle is teaching us a lot about self-acceptance and social media.\nA couple days ago at the gym, Amanda posted two photos side-by-side in which her body looks completely different. She seems super fit in the photo on the right, which she labeled “good angle / posed,” but the one on the left doesn’t look as great as what you might see on the rest of her profile. Amanda labeled this one “bad angle / relaxed.”\n#Perspective realism post today! ***I didn't mean to say that the left picture is bad. Poor word choice on my end. I should have said just relaxed / unposed** My body is still mine regardless of how I pose for a picture or whatever. Obviously most of us are inclined to never bother taking or posting a picture like the one on the left, and always wanting to / going to post a picture like the one on the right. Does it make me think any less of myself because my body doesn't look it's best in an unflattering posture / pose? Nah. That's what true self-confidence is all ABOUT PEOPLE recorded a podcast about confidence today has me feelin all kinds of good about myself you can call me whatever you want; or say those same mean things to yourself - but that's not going to make you any happier. And that's all we really want, right? #BestSelf #IgniteYourFire #IgniteYourFireCommunity #GreatnessMastermind #AmandaBucci #AllUNeedIsAGoodPairOfLeggings #Lol \nA post shared by Amanda Bucci (@amandabuccifit) on Mar 17, 2017 at 2:14pm PDT \nIt’s amazing to think that’s the same person since her body looks so different. But that’s exactly what Amanda was going for — she wanted her followers to know that many fitness Instagram stars use certain angles to make themselves look their very best.\n“ Does it make me think any less of myself because my body doesn’t look it’s best in an unflattering posture / pose? Nah,” Amanda wrote. \nHowever, she posted again the next day saying she was mistaken to use the word “bad” to describe her photo on the left. She wanted to “clarify something” with this new fitness picture, because she doesn’t want people to misunderstand what she meant by posting a “bad angle .”\nThe response to yesterday's post I DID want to clarify something I did not mean to use the word \"bad\" for the photo on the left, because looking a certain way should never be called \"bad.\" As much as in my head I though \"oh, this is a bad angle for me,\" to someone else, they might not view it the way. Funny how the language we use is truly, truly important to convey how we feel and we should all (myself included) be more careful on the message we're sending.

She then reminds everyone how important language is when we’re talking about our bodies, saying we should all “be more careful on the message we’re sending.”\nWe think it’s very cool of Amanda to be so open about her fitness journey while also being conscious of how her pictures affect people who see them. She just wants everyone to be more confident in their own skin — and that’s a message we can totally get behind.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:30:27.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
