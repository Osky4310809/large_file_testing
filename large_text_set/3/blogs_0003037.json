But needless to say, an increase in #DemExit is one of the anticipated options, even by several of the delegates Konst interview on the floor at the DNC meeting. \nA worst-case scenario is painted below. First, consider this from NBC News on whether the public views insiders of either party favorably, (my emphasis): \"One sentiment that unites the fractured nation is fury at the establishment in Washington. Fully 86 percent of those surveyed said they believe that a small group in D.C. has \"reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost . That includes 88 percent of Republicans and 85 percent of Democrats .\" \nThen consider how that broad unpopularity of insiders may intersect with this DNC election. Of that, Nathan Robinson , editor at Current Affairs , writes, \"By failing to appoint Keith Ellison to chair the DNC, Democrats have written their suicide note.\" \nHere's just a taste of the longer piece: \nThey Must Be Trying to Fail \n\nAt this point, one has to conclude that the national Democratic Party has a death wish. ... \n\n[I]t was incredibly important that the Democratic Party take some steps to indicate that it cared about progressives. Since the election, it hadn’t been doing a very good job of this. (Nancy Pelosi’s insistence that nothing needed to change, and her rebuke to a young leftist, demonstrated the prevailing attitude.) Appointing Keith Ellison to chair the DNC was the perfect opportunity. After all, chairing the DNC is a pretty minor role. It would mostly have been a gesture of friendship and unity, showing that even after the catastrophic mistake of ignoring leftist warnings not to run Clinton, the party was capable of valuing its leftmost members. \n\nBut no. Instead of granting the tiniest possible concession, the party has decided to affirm precisely what Nancy Pelosi has indicated: democratic socialists and social democrats don’t belong in the party. It’s not for them. What the party does depends on what billionaire donors want it to do. \n\nThis is politically suicidal. \nAs if that wasn't enough, Robinson adds, \"Now, progressives in the party are further alienated. Good luck getting them to vote for Democrats. ... The progressives needed to receive some kind of gesture. And they have received one: an enormous middle finger.\" Indeed. \nYour Bottom Line \nConsider these facts: \n1. It clearly mattered very much, to Obama, to high Party insiders, and to the support ecosystem around them, that no one representing the Sanders camp be allowed real power in the Party . (Sanders himself is in charge of \"outreach\" and reports in that capacity to Chuck Schumer.) Even when the role is highly visible but \"minor.\" The DNC Chair does have a modicum of control, unlike those who hold \"messaging\" roles, but even that much control won't be allowed. \n\n2. Yet all you hear from Democrats, correctly in my view, is \"Defeating Trump is Job One.\" The nation, indeed the world, is at a crossroads — on the climate front, a crossroads of world-historical proportions. \n\n3. Yet there's an obvious disconnect between the Party's rhetoric and its actions . Is control of the Party more important than bringing in the groundswell of popular support needed to defeat the Republicans in all branches of government? \n\n4. And people do notice that disconnect , more now than before. Some might even call it, not a disconnect, but a contradiction. Or hypocrisy. Some, those who couldn't pull the lever for Clinton, may even call it that at election time. \n\n5. If so — if the insider-controlled Democratic Party puts its own need for party dominance over the needs of the nation — the nation and indeed the world will suffer greatly. Will insider Democrats suffer to the same degree as the rest of us? If they think they're getting what they want, no. \nSo a question for those who gaze into the future. None of this dire predicting is certain, but it's certainly possible. Will there be a price, for the Party and the world, attached to adherence to power at any price? If there is, establishment Democrats sure are flirting with it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:42:47.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
