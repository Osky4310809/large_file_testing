And although British beauty products are slightly more under-the-radar in terms of worldwide status, there’s a few really exciting brands that are definitely worth bringing back in your suitcase. One of those brands is Models Own, and now, lucky for us, it's available in the U.S exclusively at Ulta Beauty . I remember when I studied abroad in London, being the beauty-obsessed person that I am, one of my first stops was the British drugstore Boots. I was totally drawn to Models Own nail polish because they had some of the most vibrant neon hues I’d ever seen. Here's a little backstory on the brand: It was founded in 2008, by Mark Rodol (CEO of Ministry of Sound, a popular dance and house club music label in London) and his brother Steven, with a focus on nail polish. After expanding into other beauty products, Models Own was sold to Saudi-based retail conglomerate Fawaz Alhokair & Co in 2014 for £20 million (about $25 million with today’s exchange rate). The thing that makes it such a unique line is that they offer more 650 products, so you know you’re getting variety when shopping Models Own. It will be rolling out slowly in stores and online. The brand is also affordable: the Wonderland Eyeshadow Palette with ten shades retails for $17.99, while the Sculpt and Glow Highlighter Powder will cost you just $16.99. There's also mint-flavored matte liquid lipsticks, matte foundation, bronzing powder, contour sticks, lip primer, brow gel, chrome eyeshadow kits, liquid highlighter, face primer, eyeliner, and metallic lip kits – and that's only half of it.
