In fact, back in January, we reported on a product called Lovely, a sextoy/fitness tracker for your penis . \nThe i.Con Smart Condom works similarly to other fitness trackers: Using nanochips and sensors, the sex tracker will record the speed of your thrusts, total number of thrusts, frequency of sex, number of sex sessions, girth measurement of your penis, the different sex positions you use, and how many calories you burn during sex . The i.Con Smart Condom will be kept anonymously—unless you want to share with your friends, significant others, or flat-out strangers. Because yes, there’s an option for that. \nWant one now? Not so fast. While the device is available for preorder, the company won’t actually take your money—the U.S. equivalent of roughly $74—until they settle on a solid release date. There’s no official word on when that would be, but the company says they are shooting for a release sometime this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:29:32.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
