Sharks deserve enough respect to not be used as a drinking prop by boys with a single digit IQ, but ok pal.”\n“I hope the shark ate his arm off,” said one furious viewer.\nAnother added: “This is horrible and it’s animal abuse and why the f**k would u ever????”\nWhile one seemed more concerned about the health implications of the sick stunt.\nHe said: “I understand the morality of this but Sharks eat fish, imagine the bacteria in its teeth and hes just drinking it.”\nThe “shotgunning” technique involves someone punching a hole in the side of a can while popping the ring-pull and quickly drinking the alcohol as it explodes out.\nThe helpless shark which had washed up on the beach has his mouth held open by one boy as another uses force to launch the can at its teeth.\nIt was the second video posted to Total Frat Move after a group of lads were filmed intentionally jumping into a shark tank – before swimming for their lives away from the deadly animals.\nThe video – believed to have been filmed at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas – has been viewed more than 500,000 times.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:57:37.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
