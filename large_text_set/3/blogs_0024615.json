On the heels of last week’s announcement of a Venom movie being dated for 2018 comes word, via The Hollywood Reporter that a new film is in the works that will team Spider-Man’s Black Cat and Silver Sable. \nRELATED: Venom Movie Sets 2018 Release Date \nPlans for the Silver Sable/Black Cat movie have apparently been in the works for some time. Westworld ‘s Lisa Joy-Nolan was previously developing the script and today’s trade update sets comic book and screenwriter Chris Yost up to rewrite. His previous big screen credits include Thor: The Dark World and the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok . He’s also well known for co-created X-23, who made her big screen debut in 20th Century Fox ‘s Logan . \nCreated by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz, Silver Sable made her comic book debut in 1985’s The Amazing Spider-Man #265. Hailing from the fictional European nation Symkaria, Sable is an expertly trained mercenary whose company, Silver Sable International, funds a team called the Wild Pack. Although the Wild Pack was founded by Sable’s father, she herself becomes its leader. \nBlack Cat, meanwhile, dates back to 1979’s The Amazing Spider-Man #149. Created by Marv Wolfman and Keith Pollard, Felicia Hardy is an expert burglar who has the ability to manipulate probabilities, effectively bringing bad luck to those around her. Also she was never explicitly referred to as such, Felicity Jones’ The Amazing Spider-Man 2 character was planned as an alternate version of Hardy. \nBorys Kit, who wrote the THR article, took to Twitter to make clear that neither Venom nor this Silver Sable and Black Cat movie will be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe where Tom Holland now plays the webslinger. \nHolland’s Spidey can next be seen in Spider-Man: Homecoming , in theaters July 7. Sony Pictures Animation, meanwhile, is delivering a non-MCU animated Spider-Man movie on December 21, 2018. \nWho would you like to see headline a Silver Sable and Black Cat movie?
