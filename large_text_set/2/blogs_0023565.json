Save Timothy J. Seppala, Engadget \nStarting today, you can change your Twitch username. What's more, you can do it every 60 days, and, seemingly as a shot at Microsoft and Xbox Live , it won't cost you a dime to swap from \"FluffyJungle9991\" to something a that's easier to commit to memory. \n\"Once you've changed your name, the abandoned username will be held by Twitch for a minimum of six months,\" Twitch's Emily Halpin writes on the company blog . \"After which, we may decide to return it to the pool of available usernames for the community and new users.\" \nHalpin also says that some streamers will lose access to their streamer stats after changing their names.
