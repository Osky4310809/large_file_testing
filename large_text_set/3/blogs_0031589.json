The one in the trailer is able to ‘pop’ his shield rather than have it permanently deployed. In the first game Phalanxes were a pain to fight because you had to hit either their head or hand behind the shield to stagger them. Maybe these retractable energy-based shields will make them slightly less annoying in Destiny 2. Don’t bank on it, though. That central nub may also emit some kind of projectile, as per the Taken variant —in which case they’ll be even bigger pains in the hole. \nHere’s another new enemy type. This giant brute could be anything from a regular new unit we’ll face on missions up to a raid boss, but either way those dual energy cleavers look all sorts of nasty. The Cabal are famously “800 pounds and highly militarized. They blow up planets just for getting in their way.” So nuking up our upscale apartment block is clearly NBD to them. Also take note of the colouring of this guy’s armour, because... \n...the alien dog is wearing the same stuff. Yep, these not-very-good boys are definitely a new type of Cabal enemy, rather than naturally-occurring fauna. Of course, there’s a chance that this being purely a cinematic trailer, the alien dogs won’t make their way into the main game (note that the wolves in Rise of Iron’s reveal ended up being purely cosmetic). That said, given the prominence the Cayde vs dogs fight has in this video, it’s safe to say they’ll appear as enemies. Down boy. Forever. \nThis is what three year’s worth of gear going up in smoke looks like. Destiny 2 is going to be a complete reset, with Bungie having already confirmed that only players’ appearances will carry over from the first game. Which is of course good news for PC gamers who haven’t touched the game to date, as it means everyone will be starting with the same clean slate. Having the Cabal destroy The Tower, and therefore the Guardian’s storage vaults, is a handy way for Bungie to explain the loss of all your old equipment. Though the wags on r/destinythegame are already querying why our gear stored at the Reef wouldn’t be unscathed. Mind. Blown. \nIn this sequence a Guardian ship makes a futile attempt to play pew pew with a Red Legion flotilla. I doubt this points to any sort of aerial combat, and is likely just in here for flavour and to show how many Cabal we’re facing. With the Tower reduced to ash, it does beg the question of where we’ll store our stuff now. Perhaps our ships will come equipped with their own vaults in Destiny 2. Certainly that would be preferable to schlepping across the system (or using third-party apps) just because you forgot to pack your favourite sniper rifle. \nWelcome, Gary. This is the commander of the Red Legion, better known as Ghaul to his friends, of whom he doesn’t have any. And as you can see, he has quite the thing for shoulder pads. Imagine you were casting a Destiny/Dynasty crossover. Ghaul would be the first person you called. It’s also fairly likely that the big man will be the ultimate raid boss in Destiny 2, joining the likes of Crota and Oryx. Assuming there is a raid of course, which feels fair given that Bungie would be out of their goddamn minds to release a sequel without one. \nSpeaking of casting, here are some generic concerned extras. I include this picture purely to note that the resistance seems to still comprise humans, Exo, and Awoken (the blue ones). There has been some speculation that the scavengers of the Fallen might perform a heel-face turn and become a playable race, much as the Arbiter was a second playable character for Halo 2. There’s no sign of that happening in this trailer though. In fact neither the Fallen, nor any of Destiny’s other antagonist alien races—", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:19:55.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
