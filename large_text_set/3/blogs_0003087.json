Yeah, San Francisco may be a mess for a year, but if York keeps his mitts off stuff and let’s the new GM and head coach control things the 49ers and Cousins might be an excellent match. \nIf I live to be 100, I’ll never understand what went on between Cousins and Washington’s management with this contract stuff. Most teams I know of that don’t have a decent quarterback have to be scratching their heads over this weirdness too. Cousins isn’t Tom Brady, but he sure in heck isn’t RGIII either. Mar 7, 2017 4:25 PM \nStraight up for Kaeperdoodle. Mar 7, 2017 4:29 PM \nThe Redskins sure treated him poorly last year, by paying him only 20 million dollars. Mar 7, 2017 4:29 PM \nLooks like another personnel SNAFU. Why not bring in Manzeil and make it complete mrboado says: Mar 7, 2017 4:37 PM \nThis whole situation reeks of “keeping your girlfriend around simply because you’re too scared to dump her and be alone” in addition to “you waiting to see if that hot girl you once saw at a party will call you back”. \nProblem is, that hot girl isn’t gonna call you back because 1) you hang out with Dan Synder, 2) you’re a purported racist 3) she’s hot and you’re not and 4) sure, you’re current girl isn’t hot, but it’s not like you can do better. valentino8100 says: Mar 7, 2017 4:44 PM \nThe Redskins created this problem themselves by franchising him last year, because despite the fact he’s a very good quarterback, he’s not worth what the skins are into him for. weepingjebus says: Mar 7, 2017 4:44 PM \nI don’t understand how this is happening. Shouldn’t they have worked out a deal or a trade last year under the first franchise tag? I thought that was the point of the tag. Snyder seems like one of those kids who would start a Choose Your Own Adventure book and be dead three pages later. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member?
