Speaking to the press, Aulas said that fans can expect ‘very significant sales before June 30’. To clarify, he wasn’t talking about discounts at your local skiwear store. He was talking about player sales. We think we know who he’s referring to. Lacazette bidding war \nAlexandre Lacazette has been a target for Premier League clubs for several seasons now. West Ham had two bids rejected for him last year and Arsenal are reportedly admirers. \nThe Gunners have been looking for a top class centre-forward for a while now and few in Europe are better than the French hitman. He’s scored 26 goals in all competitions this season. \nRevealing that the club made a €2.3m loss in the second half of last year, Aulas said in a conference call: “We don’t have to do anything, but as we have a squad valued at more than €170m, there will come a time when we have to cash in on that capital. So, as I did with Karim Benzema and Samuel Umtiti, if a player wants to leave and the offer is acceptable, we won’t stand in the way.” Let the bidding war commence! When the transfer window opens, we mean. \nThe Lyon squad is packed full of exciting talent. It’s going to be an interesting summer for them.
