That being said, there is obvious a huge possibility of civilians being caught in the crossfire,\" Baron added.\n\"So there is a huge danger that even if you are hitting al-Qaeda targets that civilians will be caught in the crossfire, which risks blowback beyond being a violation of international humanitarian law.\" \nREAD MORE: Key Facts about the war in Yemen \nThe latest operations come a month after a January 29 raid on al-Bayda that residents said killed 16 civilians as well as al-Qaeda fighters.\nThe operation, the first of its kind authorised by President Donald Trump, was hailed as a success by the White House and other US officials.\nBut critics questioned the value and effectiveness of the mission since it killed women and children as well as Navy SEAL Ryan Owens.\nOwens's father has described the mission as \"stupid\", and declined to meet Trump.\nAl-Qaeda has exploited a power vacuum created by two years of war between Yemen's government and Houthi rebels who control the capital to consolidate its presence, particularly in the south and east.\nSuccessive US administrations have kept up a drone war against al-Qaeda's Yemen branch since soon after the September 11, 2001 attacks.\nInside Story - Yemen: Who controls the state? \nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T18:01:10.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
