Ultimately NERC offered a concession and gave one of the remote-controlled mini-submarines the moniker. Its first mission begins this week.\nAccording to the New York Times , the lil’ submarine will embark on its inaugural mission later this week in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. The two-month venture isn’t connected to Boaty’s original designation, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, but it will take it from the RRS James Clark Ross near Punta Arenas, Chile all the way to the Southern Ocean and back. NERC’s official release offered additional mission details :\nThis month they’ll begin their first mission, traversing a deep current that originates in Antarctica and flows through the Southern Ocean. They’ll be collecting data for the Dynamics of the Orkney Passage Outflow (DynOPO) project as they ‘fly’ through submarine waterfalls and rapids, shedding light on how global warming is changing our oceans\nWhile Boaty’s fans may never fully recover from NERC’s sleight, news of the submarine’s impending mission garnered plenty of good feelings on Monday:\n\nBoaty McBoatface makes me unendingly happy.\n— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) March 13, 2017 \nLong live Boaty McBoatface #mondaymotivation #LongLiveTheKing pic.twitter.com/kZcII4ulMC \n— Dave the Goat (@thecasefarm) March 13, 2017 \nYes it's Monday, but Boaty McBoatface goes on its first Antarctic mission today so there IS REASON TO SMILE https://t.co/UHPvo05H5V \n— Elizabeth McLaughlin (@Elizabeth_McLau) March 13, 2017 \nNothing gives me more hope for the nation than the fact that, when given a choice, we called a boat Boaty McBoatface\n— Lissa Bryant (@LissaBryant93) March 13, 2017 \nBest of luck to Boaty McBoatface today. You're not a boat & nor do you have a face but don't let that hold you back. #MondayMotivation \n— Jonathan Carling (@JonathanCarling) March 13, 2017 \n\n(Via New York Times )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T18:59:53.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
