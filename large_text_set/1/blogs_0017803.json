The actor has already made his debut in the popular film franchise. \nIn Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice , Patrick Wilson voiced the President of The United States. \nTowards the end of the film, Swanwick is trying to convince the government to spare Superman's life, as they are preparing to fire a nuclear missle at Doomsday. Much to his dismay, the president calls in on speakerphone, and gives the orders to do just that. \nThe voice you hear is that of Patrick Wilson. \nThis won't make any difference when it comes to filming the Aquaman movie, as you never actually saw the president's face. Wilson will just take up his role as Orm and go to battle. \nHowever, it is cool to see actors getting involved with franchises like this before anything official has been noted by the studio. \nAquaman is directed by James Wan with Will Beall, Geoff Johns, Paul Norris, and Mort Weisinger on writing duties. Rob Cowan is serving as executive producer and Deborah Snyder and Zack Snyder serving as producers. The film stars Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Amber Heard (Mera), Patrick Wilson (Orm) and Willem Dafoe (Nuidis Vulko). \nMORE DC Films News: Learn More About Aquaman's Jason Momoa In This Touching Video / Amber Heard Returning To Gold Coast To Film Aquaman / 5 Reasons You Should Be Reading Aquaman / Director Shares New Look At Aquaman / Jason Momoa Aquaman Photos Revealed / Aquaman Release Delayed / Why Jason Momoa Identifies With Aquaman / Jason Momoa, Amber Heard To Appear On DC Comics Comic Book Covers / Aquaman Working Title Reveal \nWonder Woman opens in theaters on June 2, 2017, followed by Justice League on November 17, 2017, Aquaman on July 27, 2018, The Flash on March 16, 2018, an untitled DC Film on October 5, 2018, Shazam on April 5, 2019, Justice League 2 on June 14, 2019, an untitled DC film on November 1, 2019, Cyborg on April 3, 2020, and Green Lantern Corps on July 24, 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T08:22:12.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
