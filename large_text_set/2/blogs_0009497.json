Maybe lately you haven’t felt motivated by your job or even the slightest bit interested in what you’re doing. You probably stare at the clock all day, counting the hours until you’re free again. You’re not alone. In fact, you’re in the ranks of hundreds of thousands of people who aren’t doing what they love.\nThe good news is, it’s never too late. No matter how old you are or what you’ve been doing all these years; you can still follow through with your dreams. You should spend this life doing what you love and believing in what you’re doing.\n“Build your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs.” -Farrah Gray Read that quote. Now, read it again. Why are you at your current job? Is it just for the money? When you relegate yourself to a job you don’t feel passionate about, you’re giving up on your dreams. While you are miserable day in and day out, you’re helping somebody else realize their dreams. Is that the life you want to live?\n“Never work for money, work for passion” shows up on a list of the lessons people learn too late in life. [1] Listen to this advice. Don’t let life pass you by.\n“A successful life is one that is lived through understanding and pursuing one’s own path, not chasing after the dreams of others.” – Chin-Ning Chu Remember when you were younger and you used to dream about everything you were going to do in life? Write that dream down and create a vision for achieving it. You see, once you visualize yourself doing something, you’ve made it an attainable reality. So, it’s more likely to come true. Identifying your dream is the first step to achieving it.\nNow that you have your dream envisioned, be more specific. What exactly is your goal and what are the steps you need to take to reach that goal? Being constantly conscious of these things means that they won’t escape you again. Your dreams and goals are always there, motivating you to work harder. “Chase your vision and dream. Success will start following you.” [2] \n“Just don’t give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there’s love and inspiration, I don’t think you can go wrong.” – Ella Fitzgerald Now that we’ve talked about remembering your dreams and reconnecting with your passion, never follow this advice: “Find your passion.” This is the worst advice ever. Your passion is always there, haunting you, reminding you that you still haven’t achieved your life’s purpose. If you have to look for your passion, it’s probably not something you’re passionate about at all.\nWondering about what you love in life is tantamount to saying that you spend all day, every day thinking about things that don’t interest you. Highly unlikely. According to writer Mark Manson, “You already found your passion. You’re just ignoring it.” [3] \n“Everything you’ve ever wanted is on the other side of fear.”  – George Addair The truth is, you might be ignoring your passion because you’re afraid to go after it. It’s one thing to spend your life working for other people and getting by day to day. On the outside, you look relatively successful. But, if you actively pursue your lifelong passion and you don’t achieve your dreams – well, that would mean you’re unsuccessful. And nobody wants that, we’re all afraid of it.\nDon’t worry. There are some things you can do to boost your productivity and ensure your success. First of all, plan your day around the moments that you are most productive. Do you accomplish more during quiet mornings? Then wake up early and get to work. Don’t procrastinate. Work around your natural rhythm and learn to prioritize. Work through your list of priorities one by one to stay focused. Get in the groove of working through your daily priorities and planning tomorrow’s schedule today. Before you realize it, you’ll be well on your way to success!
