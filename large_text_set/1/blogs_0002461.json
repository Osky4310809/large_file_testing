Book of Hebrews \nThe book of Hebrews boldly proclaims the superiority of Jesus Christ and Christianity over other religions, including Judaism. In a logical argument, the author demonstrates Christ's superiority, then adds practical instructions for following Jesus. One of the outstanding features of Hebrews is the \" Faith Hall of Fame \" of Old Testament people, found in Chapter 11. Author of Hebrews \nThe author of Hebrews does not name himself. The Apostle Paul has been suggested as the author by some scholars, but the true author remains anonymous. Date Written \nHebrews was written before the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple in 70 A.D. Written To \nHebrew Christians who were wavering in their faith and all future readers of the Bible. Landscape \nAlthough addressed to Hebrews who may have been considering Jesus or Hebrew Christians who were \"homesick\" for Judaism, this book speaks to everyone who is wondering why they should follow Christ. \nHebrews transcends its ancient audience and gives answers to seekers of today. Themes in the Book of Hebrews Jesus Christ is superior. The Son of God is better than angels , priests, Old Testament leaders, or any religion. By dying on the cross and rising from the dead , Jesus guarantees believers' salvation and eternal life . Jesus serves as our mediator to the Father. Christ, the Sinless One, is our only valid representative before the throne of God. Christ's sacrifice for our sins was perfect and complete. All the laws, rituals, and animal sacrifices of the Old Testament pointed toward Jesus. When we accept him as Savior, our sins are forgiven for all time. Our Christian journey is not an easy one. We will know temptation . By depending on Jesus for help, however, we can grow stronger and bring glory to God with our life. Faith is pleasing to God. We express our faith through obedience to God . God's greatest promise to us is salvation, and that promise was fulfilled through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ. We are called to persevere. Despite temptations, trials, discipline, and backsliding , we can endure. God is faithful and has prepared a heavenly home for us.
