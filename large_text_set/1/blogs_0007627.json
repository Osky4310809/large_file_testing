Hamilton spent 2013-15 as the offensive coordinator with the Colts before joining Hue Jackson’s first staff with the Browns last year. \nOn Sunday, Jackson told reporters he knew of Hamilton’s opportunity with Michigan but said he was “ comfortable ” that Hamilton would stay with the Browns. \nHamilton traveled with Jackson to the pro day workouts for the top quarterbacks in last year’s draft, and with the Browns still looking for a long-term answer at the position Hamilton’s replacement will likely be involved in the pre-draft process this year. Jackson calls the plays for the Browns. \nThe Browns already replaced their 2016 defensive coordinator, Ray Horton, and hired Gregg Williams for that job.
