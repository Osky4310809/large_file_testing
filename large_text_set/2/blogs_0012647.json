We have so many great women leaders around the table today,” stated the president, according to Townhall . \n“And we are going to go through your names and exactly, because many of you I know. Some of you I don’t, so I want to find out all about you,” Trump continued. “They play a tremendously important role, women, in our economy. Women are the primary source of income in 40 percent of American households, and households with children under the age of 18.”   \nIvanka, who took a prominent seat at the table next to Trudeau, made a statement of her own at the meeting, according to People Magazine . \n“I’m honored to be here and really looking forward to hearing from each of you who serve as tremendous role models for me and so many other business leaders across both of our countries, and can lend some tremendously valuable perspective as we think about the unique challenges that entrepreneurs, women in the workforce, female small business owners are confronted with each and every day, and as we think how we level the playing field for this generation and for the next,” she stated. \nThe Independent Journal Review noted that the overarching goal of the council for women in business was to address and adjust the various policies and barriers that would keep some women out of the workforce, such as ensuring access to capital and markets for entrepreneurs while also seeking ways to make it easier for women to juggle the demands of a career and a family, something Ivanka is well-versed in. \nIndeed, Ivanka has made it clear that, through her unofficial role as an adviser to her father, she will advocate for special childcare tax credits and guaranteed paid family leave, which she talked about during her speech at the Republican National Convention.
