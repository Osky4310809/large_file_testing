Two of those five – retail trade (54.6% women) and accommodation and food services (54.7% women) – will be affected by the impending cuts.\nRetail is also a huge employer of young women in particular, with over a quarter (26.7%) of all women under 25 working in that industry.\n28-year-old Erin Gibbons, who works as a waitress in Melbourne, told BuzzFeed News last month she feared the industry would be thrown into uncertainty as people tried to make up for lost wages.\n“For example, going from a Sunday rate to a Saturday rate might be about $8 an hour. You times that by eight [for a full day] – where are you going to make that payment up?” she said.\n“That’s where the stress comes from. People will have to look for options, look for means to make up for that cut they’ve just received.”\nACTU chief Ged Kearney told BuzzFeed News that a huge numbers of workers, but especially women, are dependent on penalty rates to get by.\n\n“If penalty rates are cut, women will see a huge decrease in their weekly wage, which is why the union movement is determined not to allow that to happen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:59:18.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
