The Facebook video has been watched 32m times. \nDuring the one-minute clip the woman is first interrupted by a young child in a yellow jumper. She seamlessly continues answering complex political questions about South Korea while pulling the child onto her lap and feeding her a bottle. \nNext, a baby totters into the room with a walker, and the woman continues answering questions, her eyes never leaving the camera, whilst holding the child in her lap, and entertaining the baby with a rattling ball. \nAs the child wanders out of the room the mother reaches off-camera and pulls out a roast chicken dinner, sniffing it to check if it is ready. \nThe BBC interviewer observes “You do look rather busy there, we can reschedule ...” but the woman ignores him, reaching for a shirt to de-lint while she speaks, and, a moment later, scrubbing a toilet bowl that appears on her left. \nThe interview continues as a bomb squad in flak-jackets burst into the room, and the woman defuses a bomb; “Oh my god, is that a bomb?” asks the interviewer. \nAs the interview draws to a close a man in bare feet speaking in a broad New Zealand accent rushes into the study, flapping a sock at the woman’s back. Prof Robert Kelly: 'We were worried the BBC would never call us again' Read more \n“I can’t find my missing sock, I have looked everywhere, I have looked in the sock drawer!” he says, panicked. \nThe BBC presenter thanks the woman for her time, calling the interview “interesting”. The woman smiles warmly, her eyes finally leaving the camera. “OK, let’s find this sock then!” she says cheerfully. \nThe Jono and Ben version of the video was greeted with a decidedly mixed response. Some female commentators called the video “hilarious” and said it was an accurate and amusing reflection of a working mother’s life. However many others, both male and female, labelled the parody “sexist” and said it was a classic example of “man-bashing”. \nThe original video became a global hit, making Kelly’s family overnight internet stars . \nWhile the candid video was mostly embraced as a charming and spontaneous moment of family life interrupting a professional interview, some viewers were critical of the professor’s reaction, saying he should have responded to his children instead of ignoring them.
