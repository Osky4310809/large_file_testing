Also, feel free to add and suggest content. How is this different from /r/EnoughTrumpSpam ? \nThis subreddit is for organizing and discussing resistance against Trump and his government, which thrives on dividing USA by skin tone and religion. We believe this is wrong and action must be taken. \nThis is not necessarily a liberal or left-wing subreddit. Center(-right) and other anti-Trump people are welcome as well, as long as you agree with the common cause: To stop America from heading in the wrong direction of xenophobia and racism.
