(Photo: Doane Gregory, Universal Pictures) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAre you excited for the return of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele? Fifty Shades Darker arrives in theaters Thursday and we've got six big secrets straight from the set. \n1. The Red Room got a facelift. \nWhen director James Foley came aboard for Fifty Shades Darker (and upcoming third installment Fifty Shades Freed ), he decided to warm up the set design. “Christian’s apartment is somewhat different,\" says Foley. \"We changed the color of the walls and the carpets and a lot of things. The Red Room came along with that. We felt like the first Red Room was a bit spare and not particularly inviting or sensuous. So we wanted to plush it up.\" (Fun fact: Christian's staircase is now translucent.) \nFifty Shades author E.L. James approves of the renovations, particularly in the Red Room. \"It just looked warmer and richer and it was certainly more in keeping with how I had perceived it when I had written about it,\" she says. \n2. In 'Darker,' Johnson pays tribute to her mom. \nJohnson may not let her parents, Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, watch the Fifty Shades franchise (\"I’d be so uncomfortable the whole time\") but perhaps Griffith will get to see just one snippet of her daughter paying tribute to her mom's seminal 1988 film Working Girl. \"I don't expect you to fetch me coffee unless you're getting some for yourself,\" Anastasia tells a co-worker as she settles into a big new publishing job. \n\"That’s my favorite part,\" says Johnson, crediting screenwriter Niall Leonard (James' husband) for the idea. \"I thought it was the sweetest thing ever. Because when has that ever happened in the history of film? And that’s also such an iconic line from Working Girl . So it’s so special.\" \nMelanie Griffith and Dakota Johnson arrived together at the 2015 Academy Awards. (Photo: Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY) \n3. There were new body rules. \nBefore filming Darker , Dornan tanned, increased his muscle mass and grew some scruff. \"Shaving every day sucks,\" he cracks. \"It’s also a weird psychological thing, but ... I feel very exposed and naked with a shaved face.” \n4. Their pre-game ritual for sex scenes? Pushups. \n\"You did a lot of pushups,\" grins Johnson, thinking back to how they prepped for R-rated trysts. When cameras rolled, Johnson helped out in awkward moments. \"It could get tense and then Dakota would snort and break everybody up and everything was fine,\" Foley says.
