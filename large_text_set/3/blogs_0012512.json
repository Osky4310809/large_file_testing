Last week, we told you how the Celebrity Equinox came uncomfortably close to a Fort Lauderdale home , scaring the homeowners (and their dog), who filmed the entire thing from their deck. Now, there’s a new video of yet another close encounter, this time between the Carnival Magic cruise ship and a couple of jet skiers. \nOn Saturday afternoon, Canaveral Pilots Association Captain Doug Brown was navigating the 130,000-ton Carnival Magic out of Port Canaveral when he noticed a jet ski operating in the channel. Brown then alerted a Brevard County Sheriff Marine Unit that was nearby, operated by Deputy Taner Primmer, which then approached the stray jet ski. In a series of scary events, the jet ski flipped over, leaving its two passengers stranded in the water. By working with the Carnival Magic captain and bridge team to maneuver away from the passengers, Primmer was able to pull them onto his boat and away from the impending cruise ship. \nThe entire incident was captured by a passenger on the cruise ship and posted to YouTube. You can watch it, below: \nFeatured image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T04:19:38.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
