Head coach Hue Jackson was asked about Osweiler in an interview with NFL Network scheduled to air Monday. \n“He is,” Jackson said when asked if Osweiler would be part of the team this year. “Obviously, he’s a player on our team and we’re going to treat him just like we do all of our other quarterbacks until he’s not. \n“He’s a guy that’s gonna come in and compete. We haven’t had an opportunity to meet with him from a football standpoint because of the rules. But once we start our offseason program, phase one, we’ll get a chance to know him and he’ll get to know us.” \nJackson and the Browns are not tipping their hand when it comes to their long-term plans for Osweiler. But the organization didn’t appear to place the 26-year-old quarterback in high regard after acquiring him. \nHours after the deal, Browns GM Sashi Brown spoke highly of the second-round pick they also landed in the move, but gave just a passing mention to Osweiler. \n“We’re really excited to acquire a second round draft choice in this trade,” Brown said in a statement March 9. “Draft picks are extremely important to our approach in building a championship caliber football team. We are intent on adding competition to every position on our roster and look forward to having Brock come in and compete.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T21:20:51.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
