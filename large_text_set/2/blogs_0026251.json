It was subsequently halted by a series of judicial orders, one of which cited Trump’s own campaign rhetoric as being partially responsible for court’s decision to suspend the ban. \nFollowing the suspension, the President angrily tweeted that he would “see you in court,” although White House officials subsequently signaled that they would focus on revising the content of the executive order, rather than appeal the judges’ opinions. \nWhile the exact content of Trump’s new order is still unclear, a leaked draft indicates the revised ban would loosen some of the initial restrictions on green card holders, and remove language that singled out Syrian refugees. It would, however, still focus on the seven predominantly Muslim nations targeted by its predecessor. \nAs White House advisor Steven Miller explained during an interview with Fox News, the new ban would “have the same basic policy outcome” as before.
