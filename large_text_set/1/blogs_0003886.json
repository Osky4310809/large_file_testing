(Photo: kieferpix, Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nFresh off last year’s successful effort to make it more difficult for you to see who is financing Arizona’s political campaigns, the Legislature will make a run this year at making it more difficult for you to see how the public’s business is being conducted. \nSen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, has proposed that government officials be allowed to deny public records requests that are considered “unduly burdensome or harassing.” \nLike maybe the public records request filed by The Republic’s Rob O’Dell and Craig Harris in 2015? The one that showed taxpayers shelled out more than $6 million to settle discrimination, harassment and other workplace claims by 57 public employees between 2009 and 2014 – yet hardly any of the discriminators and harassers were disciplined? \nOr maybe the public records requests filed by the Arizona Capitol Times last year? The ones that showed then-House Speaker David Gowan collected more than $1,600 in per diem for days he didn’t work? And traveled the state on the public’s dime (or actually the public’s thousands of dollars) as he campaigned for Congress? \nOr maybe the public records request filed by The Republic’s Ken Alltucker last year? The one that showed that Joe G.N. “Skip” Garcia, University of Arizona’s then-senior vice president for health sciences, took $44,000 worth of out-of-state trips over three years and that his in-state travel cost us $34,000-plus? (Chauffeur-driven limousines do tend to be pricey, don’t you know.) He says it's not aimed at the media, but ... \nI can see where our leaders might find such revelations “unduly burdensome or harassing” – not to mention embarrassing. \nAs for the rest of us, we find them enlightening. \nFor now, at least. \nThis is year two in Kavanagh’s quest to create an end run around the Arizona Public Records Law. Last year’s bill sailed through the Senate but died in the House. \nROBERTS: Got cash? It's legislative shakedown week! \nLook for Kavanagh to assure us once again that Senate Bill 1019 isn’t intended to limit public access to public information – never mind that we already have a hard time dragging certain public records out of public agencies. (Ask Harris and O’Dell how long it took them to get public officials to cough up records about those harassment and discrimination lawsuits.) \nActually, I believe Kavanagh when he says he’s only looking to curb abuses by a handful of gadflies who file vague public records requests in city halls across the state -- requiring hours of work from public employees -- then fail to even pick up the resulting records. \nThe problem is, his bill could oh-so-easily be used to shut out not only the media but citizens who have every right to know how their government – the one they pay for with their taxes – is being run. Sue to get records? That's not the point \nJust as citizens once upon a time had the right to know who was funding elections in this state. Last year’s campaign finance “reform” will make it easier for special interests to hide in the bushes in 2018, as they secretly spend big money to influence Arizona’s elections. \nNow on the heels of that particular blackout comes the prospect of weakening the Arizona Public Records Law. \nBut not to worry. Kavanagh points out that anybody who believed they were unfairly denied a public record could always sue to get it. \nAnybody, that is, who can afford to pay an attorney $400 an hour and spend tens of thousands of dollars to get their case before a judge. \nTranslation: almost nobody.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T12:55:16.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
