Photo: AFL Media/Getty Images \nLingering shoulder concerns meant Murphy played more of an outside midfielder role early last season, but having overcome those issues, Murphy flagged not only more time as an inside midfielder, but also rests closer to goal. \n\"Certainly this year I've done a lot of training inside so I'll play a lot inside mid, filter on a wing, and then also go deep forward as well,\" Murphy told RSN on Tuesday.

While Carlton tightened their defensive structures under first-year coach Brendon Bolton in 2016, the Blues finished second-last for points scored – above only depleted Essendon – averaging just 71 points per game.

Having been named the AFL Coaches' Association's champion player in 2011 – a year in which he was also All-Australian and was the Blues' best and fairest – Murphy has been unable to reach those same lofty heights. \nAll but certain to retain the captaincy for a fifth season when the Blues announce their leadership group in coming weeks, Murphy said he was motivated by the challenges of recent years in which he has dealt with several injuries, and the Blues have entered a rebuilding phase under Bolton following the ill-fated coaching stint of Mick Malthouse. \n\"I suppose the last few years are still driving me,\" Murphy said. \n\"I played [10] games out of the 22 last year, and was pretty frustrated the way it all finished. From outside the footy club I've sort of copped a little bit over the years about not leading from the front. \n\"I've played some good footy over the last couple of years, but not to the level I know I can get to.\" \nMurphy has barely missed a session during the pre-season, and said he was eagerly awaiting Carlton's pre-season opener against Melbourne at Casey Field on February 25. \n\"I'm 29, but feel like I'm 22 at the moment, and I'm really excited to get stuck into these pre-season games in four weeks' time,\" he said. \nMurphy also said he was glad to be able to help lead pre-season training, having missed much of that experience last summer. \"Being able to work on the game plan with Boltsy and the other coaches, and put in my two cents about how I see things out there has been really important as well.\" Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:39:13.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
