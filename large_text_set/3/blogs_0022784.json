As the conversation continued around politics, he made an assumption that we were close in age, saying as someone in her late twenties/early thirties, surely I could relate. I pointed out that I'm actually in my mid-forties (I'll be 45 in June), at which the driver abruptly adjusted the rearview mirror with shock and said, \"There is NO WAY you're that old! You don't look your age!\"\nThis situation happens to me often. I know he meant it as a sincere compliment, but I'm troubled by the concept that somehow I'm winning at life because I don't have more visible, external signs of aging. It seems after a certain age, \"You don't look your age!\" is supposed to be the Mother of All Compliments, feathered in a soft nest of \"I would never have guessed!\" and \"OMG, are you serious?\" While I appreciate the flattery, I'm always left with a very uneasy feeling: what does that say about how we feel about women and aging ?\nWhat makes this well-meaning compliment so unsettling is it implies there's something wrong with looking middle-aged or older. We live in a youth-obsessed culture. It's almost as if we have invisible expiration dates on our skin, and any sign of wear and tear sets off an alarm. The catalyst makes us feel suddenly shamed and expendable.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media4.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/fwr29-9KAE0Kmsb2e70vw7D6J4M/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/03/02/773/n/1922398/9d1ce0314dcf967b_giafrese-20150625-7032.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-21T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:34:36.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
