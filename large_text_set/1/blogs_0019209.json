Just days ago, Louis spoke publicly for the first time about his mum's death after she lost her leukemia battle aged just 43. 'It’s not something that I feel 100 per cent comfortable talking too much about but just quickly, when I first found out the news I kind of did want to throw the towel in,' he admitted during an interview on SiriusXM Radio. 'But it was my mum who said to me that I’ve just got to keep going, telling me very sternly that she wanted me to. So I’m not doing it for her but…' Joined for his interview by DJ Steve Aoiki, he said of his emotional X Factor performance just days after her death: 'It was tough, but I felt like it was nice for me to almost have a little send off for her.' Meanwhile, Louis and actress Danielle, 21, have reportedly gone their separate ways after just over a year of dating but insiders insist there is 'no bad feeling' between them and the pair will stay friends.
