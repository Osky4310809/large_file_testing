But in mid-January, she was arrested without hearing charges or being read her rights and handed her a court order charging her with neglect for her children.\n\"Basically, I'm charged with neglect because my children are not attending a school that they're not enrolled in,\" Harris said in a Facebook video she posted on January 18. She mentioned an upcoming appearance in criminal court, where \"I'm being charged as a criminal for contempt of the court for obstructing an order to have my children illegally kidnapped from me.\"\nIt's no wonder that Harris described the New York State authorities as \"terrorists.\"\nAfter her story was reported Monday by ABC News' local affiliate 7 Eyewitness News , Buffalo Common Councilman Ulyssees O. Wingo Sr. said on Tuesday it was \"utterly unacceptable\" that Harris was arrested for \"educational neglect\" due to her decision to homeschool her children. \"Someone, somewhere messed up, and that someone needs to face the music,\" Wingo said at a Buffalo Common Council meeting Tuesday afternoon.\nHarris claimed to have filed the necessary documents to homeschool her children in early December ( New York State law requires a \"Letter of Intent\" within 14 days of the start of a child's education at home, as well as an Individualized Home Instruction Plan (IHIP), along with attendance records, quarterly reports, and annual assessments.)\nHarris provided the necessary documents to 7 Eyewitness News — dated December 7, 2016 (her Facebook video said December 5) — and the news station said the district acknowledged receiving her paperwork.\n\"I spoke directly to the homeschool coordinator and she told me from this point on my children were officially un-enrolled from school,\" Harris told 7 Eyewitness News. A week later, however, she said Child Protective Services called, asking why her kids weren't in school. \"I told them that my kids were homeschool now and that I could furnish the documents if they need to see them.\"\nIn the Facebook video, Harris told the harrowing story of her arrest. \"Long story short, I'm driving — this was last week, Friday January 13,\" she explained. Driving past her house, she saw police cars. She checked to make sure she had \"everything legal and in order, not breaking any laws. I've never been arrested in my life. I'm 30 years old, never been arrested.\"\nHow Homeschooling Helped Propel Simone Biles to the Olympic Gold\nBut the cops recognized her vehicle, and they follow her. After a while, she pulls over, and the unthinkable happens.\n\"They come to my vehicle, they snatch me out of my car,\" Harris recalled. \"They illegally impound my vehicle — because my registration was good, my insurance was valid. They refuse to tell me my charges. They refuse to read me my rights, they arrested me and they handed me this paper, this court summons. They demanded to know where my children were because they wanted to remove the children from my custody ... They're kidnapping my children, basically.\"\nhttps://pjmedia.com/parenting/2017/02/08/buffalo-n-y-single-mother-says-she-was-arrested-for-homeschooling-her-children/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.wkbw.com/news/was-buffalo-mom-jailed-over-homeschooling-decision", "http://www.homeschoolfacts.com/state-laws/new-york-homeschool-state-laws.html", "http://www.wkbw.com/news/wingo-calls-homeschooling-arrest-unacceptable"], "published": "2017-02-08T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:34:22.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
