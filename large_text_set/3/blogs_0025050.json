Oshie (right) have each recorded six points over their past five games. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports) 184 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNo one around the NHL views the Presidents' Trophy as a predictor of playoff success. Since 2003, only two of 13 teams that finished No. 1 overall have gone on to win the Stanley Cup. \nBut winning that title has added value this season because the NHL’s top three teams, Washington, Pittsburgh and Columbus, are all in the Metropolitan Division. The runner-ups in the race will face each other in the opening playoff round. \n“That’s going to be a test right off the bat, and it could leave a mark for the second round,” Washington Capitals coach Barry Trotz told USA TODAY Sports. \nThe Chicago Blackhawks, currently fourth in the Presidents' Trophy race with 100 points and nine games remaining, could easily step up and win it. But that wouldn’t change the reality that the losers of the battle for Metropolitan Division supremacy have a tougher playoff road. \nHere’s a capsule look at the Metropolitan race: Washington Capitals (47-17-8, 102 points) \nSchedule : 10 games remaining. March 23, Columbus; 25, Arizona; 28, at Minnesota; 29, at Colorado; 31, at Arizona; April 2, at Columbus; 4, at Toronto; 5, New York Rangers; 8, at Boston; 9, at Florida. \nAnalysis : Challenge of facing Columbus twice should be offset by three games against Colorado and Arizona, two teams that have a combined goal-differential of minus-153. Only caution: Coyotes have looked sharper lately, with a 5-3-2 record in their last 10. \nInjuries: None \nHow they are playing : Their 5-4-1 record in last 10 is misleading because they are 3-0-1 in their last four. Nicklas Backstrom boasts one goal and 10 assists in his past five games. Alex Ovechkin has two goals and six points in past five after going 10 games without a goal. \nWhat they need : Split with Columbus, a .935 save percentage from goaltender Braden Holtby and continued top-line dominance. Magic number is 19. Pittsburgh Penguins (46-17-9, 101 points) \nSchedule : 10 games remaining. March 23, at Ottawa; 24, New York Islanders; 26, Philadelphia; 29, Chicago; 31, at Rangers; April 2, Carolina; 4, Columbus; 6, at New Jersey; 8, at Toronto; 9, at Rangers. \nAnalysis : Challenging schedule with six of final 10 against teams in playoff positions, including two games against the Rangers and one against Columbus. \nInjuries: They've been hit hardest by injuries. Kris Letang (upper body) has been out since Feb. 21 and Evgeni Malkin (shoulder) and Ron Hainsey (upper body) haven’t played since March 15. Jake Guentzel suffered a concussion March 21. Carl Hagelin, Bryan Rust, Trevor Daley and Olli Maatta are also out. Maatta (hand) hasn’t played since Feb. 16 and Daley had knee surgery and won’t be back until the playoffs. \nHow they are playing : The Penguins are 8-2-1 in March and Sidney Crosby has been unstoppable with seven goals and two assists in his past five games. \nWhat they need : Fewer injuries, particularly the return of Letang and Malkin, going 4-0-0 against non-playoff teams and beating Columbus. Columbus Blue Jackets (47-19-6, 100 points) \nSchedule : 10 games remaining. March 23, at Washington; 25, Philadelphia; 28, Buffalo; 30, at Carolina; 31, at Chicago; April 2, Washington; 4, at Pittsburgh; 6, Winnipeg; 8, at Philadelphia; 9, at Toronto. \nAnalysis : Probably has the toughest schedule because it plays Washington twice and Pittsburgh once among five games against teams in playoff position. \nInjuries: Ryan Murray (broken hand) won’t be back until the playoffs. \nHow they are playing: The Blue Jackets are 8-3-0 in March, though they lost to Toronto 5-2 on March 22. Coach John Tortorella has them playing like the Rangers did when he first arrived in New York. \nWhat they need: Must sweep Washington and down Pittsburgh to clear their path to No. 1 overall. Prediction \nThe Penguins win Presidents' Trophy by one point over the Blue Jackets, who must meet Washington in the first round of the playoffs.
