[UFC brass, including Dana White, were] in front of me and they were saying ‘these [visitors] want you to be in Game of Thrones.’”\nHe then went on to add: “I’m banged up, my shin’s in a heap, I’ve been kicking his knee’s straight for 25 minutes, my leg’s in bits, and he’s trying to offer me a Game of Thrones role. And I’m saying, ‘Listen, come at me with sh– I want to hear, I’m not trying to be in show business, I’m trying to be in the fight business. Come at me with a real number to fight again. So that was the only time I ever heard the [words] Games of Thrones. And it went everywhere like months later! So I don’t know where that came from. But I’ve never been in contact with nobody from Game of Thrones and now I’m starring in Game of f—ing Thrones!”\nSo while it doesn’t appear that we’ll see McGregor making his HBO acting debut any time soon, we still might get that much-coveted fight between he and Floyd Mayweather. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:20:13.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
