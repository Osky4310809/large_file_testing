The agency knows that some folks age 70½ and older aren’t taking their annual RMDs, and it’s looking at this closely . Those who fail to take the proper amount can be hit with a penalty equal to 50% of the shortfall. Also on the IRS’s radar are early retirees and others who take payouts before reaching age 59½ and who don’t qualify for an exception to the 10% penalty on these early distributions. \nIndividuals age 70½ and older must take RMDs from their retirement accounts by the end of each year. However, there’s a grace period for the year in which you turn 70½: You can delay the payout until April 1 of the following year. A special rule applies to those still employed at age 70½ or older: You can delay taking RMDs from your current employer’s 401(k) until after you retire (this rule doesn’t apply to IRAs). The amount you have to take each year is based on the balance in each of your accounts as of December 31 of a prior year and a life-expectancy factor found in IRS Publication 590-B .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:27:52.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
