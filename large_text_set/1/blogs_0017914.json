Jim Bourg/The Associated Press \nWASHINGTON – Donald Trump told Americans he would “make America great again” and vowed to bring back jobs and wealth to the homeland, sending jitters through nations hosting US companies. \n“We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams,“ Trump said after being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States at noon Friday at the Capitol grounds in Washington. “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.” \nWith nearly all the former US presidents in attendance led by Barack Obama along with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, Trump outlined an inward-looking policy that he said would follow two “simple rules” – “buy American and hire American.” \n“From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” he said. “It is the right of all nations to seek their own interests first.” \nIn a tweet Thursday as the festivities started, Trump declared, “`The journey begins and I will be working and fighting very hard to make it a great journey for the American people. I have no doubt that we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” \nTrump takes the helm of a deeply divided nation and putting Republicans in control of the White House for the first time in eight years.   \nThe billionaire businessman and former reality television star has pledged an era of profound change, energizing his supporters with promises to wipe away predecessor Barack Obama’s signature achievements and to restore America to a lost position of strength. But Trump’s call for restrictive immigration measures and his caustic campaign rhetoric about women and minorities have infuriated other millions of Americans. He assumes office as one of the most unpopular incoming presidents in modern history. \nThe pomp and pageantry of the inaugural celebrations were also shadowed by questions about Trump’s ties to Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have determined worked to tip the 2016 election to help the Republican win. \nTrump’s inauguration drew crowds to the nation’s capital to witness the history. It repelled others. More than 60 House Democrats refused to attend his swearing in ceremony in the shadow of the Capitol dome. One Democrat who did sit among the dignitaries was Hillary Clinton, Trump’s vanquished campaign rival who was widely expected by both parties to be the one taking the oath of office. \nInstead, it was Trump placing his hand on two Bibles, one used by his family and another used for President Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration. At 70, Trump is the oldest person to be sworn in as president, marking a generational step backward after two terms for Obama, one of the youngest presidents to serve as commander in chief. \nTrump takes charge of an economy that has recovered from the Great Recession but has nonetheless left millions of Americans feeling left behind. The nation’s longest war is still being waged in Afghanistan and U.S. troops are battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The American health care system was expanded to reach millions more Americans during Obama’s tenure, but at considerable financial costs. Trump has vowed to dismantle and rebuild it. \nTrump faces such challenges as the first president to take office without ever having held a political position or served in the military. He has stacked his Cabinet with established Washington figures and wealthy business leaders. Though his team’s conservative bent has been cheered by many Republicans, the overwhelmingly white and male Cabinet has been criticized for a lack of diversity. \nOfficials expected hundreds of thousands of people to flock to the National Mall to witness the inauguration of the 45th president, though early crowds appeared smaller than past celebrations. Demonstrations unfolded at various security checkpoints near the Capitol as police in riot gear helped ticket-holders get through to the ceremony. \nIn a show of solidarity, all of the living American presidents attended the swearing-in ceremony, except for 92-year-old George H.W. Bush, who was hospitalized this week with pneumonia. His wife, Barbara, was also admitted to the hospital after falling ill. \nWhile Trump came to power bucking convention, he wrapped himself in the traditions that accompany the peaceful transfer of power. Following a morning church service with his family, Trump and his wife, Melania, had tea at the White House with Obama and outgoing first lady Michelle Obama. \nThe two couples greeted each other with handshakes and hugs, and Mrs. Trump presented Mrs. Obama with a gift. Following their private gathering in the executive mansion, the Trumps and Obamas traveled together to the Capitol for the swearing in ceremony. \nTrump slept at Trump Tower in New York City on Wednesday night before heading to Washington on Thursday, the day before he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. \nThe property mogul also tweeted a quote from the Rev. Franklin Graham, who will take part in the inauguration ceremony. \n“‘It wasn’t Donald Trump that divided this country, this country has been divided for a long time!’ Stated today by Reverend Franklin Graham,” Trump wrote. \nHe also told Americans on Thursday night that he will “unify” the nation after a bruising election campaign, as he prepared for his inauguration the following day at the US Capitol. \n“We’re going to unify our country,” Trump told a crowd of thousands in front of the Lincoln Memorial after a pre-inauguration concert. “We’re going to do things that haven’t been done for our country for many, many decades. It’s going to change. I promise you.” \nTrump touched down on Thursday at Washington’s Andrews Air Force Base, about 24 hours before he was to be sworn in. Trump traded his personally branded Boeing 757 for a US Air Force version of the same plane, following the custom of a first flight to the nation’s capital aboard a military aircraft. \n“It is going to be a very humbling and moving day for the president-elect, his family and mine,” vice president-elect Mike Pence said at a briefing for reporters on Thursday. “We are ready to go to work. In fact, we can’t wait to get to work for the American people.” \nEbullient Trump supporters flocked to the nation’s capital for the inaugural festivities, some wearing red hats emblazoned with his “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. \nBut in a sign of deep divisions Trump sowed during his combative campaign, dozens of Democratic lawmakers were boycotting the swearing-in ceremony on Capitol Hill. \nWhile Trump came to power bucking convention, he was wrapping himself in the traditional pomp and pageantry that accompanies the peaceful transfer of power. The president-in-waiting will attend church with his family Friday morning, then meet President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for tea at the White House. The Trumps and the Obamas will travel together in the presidential limousine for the short trip to the Capitol for the noon swearing-in ceremony. \nTrump supporters started lining up at security checkpoints before dawn to take their places in the quadrennial rite of democracy. \n“I’m here for history,” said Kevin Puchalski, a 24-year-old construction worker who drove from Philadelphia to attend the swearing-in. “This is the first president that I voted for that won.” \nHis big hope: Trump builds that promised wall on the US-Mexican border. “Keep the illegals out,” he said. \nAides said Trump had been personally invested in crafting his inaugural address, a relatively brief 20-minute speech that is expected to center on his vision for what it means to be an American. \nSpokesman Sean Spicer said the address would be “less of an agenda and more of a philosophical document.” \nTrump has pledged to upend Obama’s major domestic and national security policies, including repealing his signature health care law and building a wall along the US-Mexico border. But he’s offered few details of how he plans to accomplish his agenda, often sending contradictory signals. \nWith rain a possibility, the National Park Service announced that it was easing its “no umbrella” policy for Friday, allowing collapsible umbrellas along the parade route and on the National Mall. \nThe nation’s soon-to-be president joked about the chance of a downpour. “That’s OK,” Trump told campaign donors at an event Thursday night, “because people will realize it’s my real hair.” \n“Might be a mess, but they’re going to see that it’s my real hair,” he said. \n\nProtests from Sydney to Addis Ababa \n\nTrump faces protests in Washington during his inauguration, and in cities from Toronto to Sydney, Addis Ababa, the Philippines and Dublin over his politics which critics say are divisive and dangerous. \nThe protest in London was organized by the campaign group also called “Bridges not Walls,” in reference to Trump’s pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border. \n“We won’t let the politics of hate peddled by the likes of Donald Trump take hold,” Nona Hurkmans of Bridges not Walls said in a statement. \nTrump opponents have been angered by his comments during the campaign about women, illegal immigrants and Muslims and his pledges to scrap the Obamacare health reform and build a wall on the Mexican border. \nThe Republican’s supporters admire his experience in business, including as a real estate developer and reality television star, and view him as an outsider who will take a fresh approach to politics. \nFor some in the protest in London, Trump’s victory a little over four months after the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union symbolizes a rise of populism across the West. \n“For me it’s about not just the inauguration of Trump, but about the rise of right wing populism across Western Europe and the US, and Trump’s inauguration is a celebration of that,” said Jac St. John, 26, a doctoral student from London, who unfurled one of the banners. \nIn London, a banner reading “Build bridges not walls” was draped across London’s Tower Bridge on Friday as part of a series of protests across the world aimed at expressing displeasure at the inauguration of Trump as US president. \nProtesters on the drawbridge, with its two Gothic-style towers, held up pink letters reading “Act now!” soon after sunrise, while others unfurled the banner over the railings and a speedboat with a black flag reading “build bridges not walls” raced down the River Thames. \nBeside the British parliament, protesters draped banners saying “Migrants welcome here” and “Migration is older than language” over Westminster bridge. Other protests are planned in London, other British cities and across the world on Friday. - AP, Reuters  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T12:36:04.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
