And, like his 2008 speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, we're certain this will be a glorious event complete with a slew of celebrities and all the pomp and circumstance befitting a king...rest assured that no taxpayer expense was spared. \nWhile the content of Obama's remarks have not been revealed, earlier today he posted the following preview on Facebook which noted that he looks forward to going back to \"where it all started\" and humbly affirmed that he's \" made America a better, stronger place for the generations that will follow.\" \nFor Michelle and me, Chicago is where it all started. It’s the city that showed us the power and fundamental goodness of the American people. \n\nIt’s that inherent strength that brought our country through our fair share of challenges these last eight years. Because of you, we’ve come through them stronger. Because of you, we’ve held to a belief that has guided us ever since our founding – our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better. \n\nIt’s easy to lose sight of that in the blizzard of our minute-to-minute Washington news cycles. But America is a story told not minute to minute, but generation to generation – a story written by parents, and teachers, and veterans, and neighbors who’ve taken on the call of citizenship, working together, without fanfare, to form a more perfect union. \n\nOver the course of my life, I’ve been reminded time and again that change can happen – that ordinary people can come together to achieve extraordinary things. And I’ve seen that truth up close over these last eight years . \n\nWe’ve made America a better, stronger place for the generations that will follow. We’ve run our leg in a long relay of progress, knowing that our work will always be unfinished. And we’ve reaffirmed the belief that we can make a difference with our own hands, in our own time. That’s the imperative of citizenship – the idea that, with hard work, and a generous heart toward our fellow Americans, people who love their country can change it. \n\nSo tonight, I’m returning to where it all began to offer my most grateful farewell to the American people. I hope you’ll join me – I want to thank you for everything you’ve done. \nAnd while Obama will undoubtedly brag about his amazing \"economic recovery,\" we would once again highlight the following data that seemingly paints a slightly more sobering picture. \n\nOf course, these charts that we presented last summer also cast a slight shadow over Obama's \"economic recovery.\" \n\nUnfortunately for Obama, simply stating something repeatedly doesn't actually make it a fact. \nAnd speaking of repeating fictitious stories until they somehow become fact, as Post News pointed out yesterday, for weeks now Obama and his various mouthpieces have been peddling the fiction that his administration managed to spend 8 years in the White House without a single major scandal. And while that would be a fantastic accomplishment, unfortunately it's every bit as \"fake\" as the Obama \"economic recovery.\" In fact, here are just a few of the scandals that plagued the Obama administration over the years (a detailed description of each can be viewed here ).
