A video posted by M2THAK (@m2thaksodmg) on Feb 7, 2017 at 12:59pm PST \nReports found that the image is actually from a mommy blog called Rooney’s Adventure in Pregnancy . \nThis isn’t the first time Hip Hop fans have been trolled by a pregnancy announcement this week as Nicki Minaj teased fans with a pretty convincing photo of a baby bump. \n(This article was first published today [February 7, 2017] at 11:50 a.m. PST and is as follows.) \nIn case you haven’t gotten enough Soulja Boy headlines yet in 2017, the Atlanta rapper shared the news today (February 7) that he is going to be a father. \nSoulja Boy made an Instagram post (that he then deleted) of an ultrasound image with a baby that says the pregnancy is 12 weeks along. \nAs far as who the mother of the child is, we can only speculate. Soulja was romantically involved with India Love , but he never claimed her as his girl and even got in a beef with Lil Yachty over her. He has also had a rocky relationship with Love and Hip Hop co-star Nia Riley. \nSoulja Boy seemingly has at least one other child as he tweeted he was going to have a son in September. \nWith his boxing match against Chris Brown up in the air, Soulja will have more reason to prove himself in the ring as he welcomes another bundle of joy.
