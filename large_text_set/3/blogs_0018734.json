I remember trying - French and Spanish were easy, but we tried two other languages, German and Japanese. \n\"After trying both and having both of them fail just abysmally, we ended up sticking with French.\" \nDuring a previous Rolling Stone interview, Dave said \"A Tout Le Monde\" is actually dedicated to his mother , noting: \n\"I wrote ['A Tout Le Monde'] for my mom when she died. It was kind of an epitaph for her. The premise of the song was that my mom was able to come back to visit me in a dream and she could say only one thing to me, then it was off. When I asked her what it was, it was, 'I love you.' And that's what the song was about.\" \nAnd speaking of Spanish language Dave mentioned, there are actually alternate versions of Megadeth songs with Mustaine singing in Spanish.
