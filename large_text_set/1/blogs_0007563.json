Buzz Concept Image courtesy of Volkswagon \nThe original VW Transporter was an underpowered, under-equipped, underheated death trap, best known for barely being capable of motivating itself quick enough to maintain freeway speeds. Even without six bearded stoners aboard, you would not consider a Volkswagen Bus a muscle car. \nBut that’s the thing about muscle cars. They’re stealthy. Underneath this concept’s familiar bread loaf exterior there’s no wheezy air-cooled sewing machine engine. Instead, it comes with a pair of battery-powered electric motors for all-wheel drive capability and a rip-roaring 369 horsepower —about 1200% more power than that delivered by the first VW Bus, making us about 1200% more interested. BMW M550i xDrive Image courtesy of BMW \nBMW’s 5-Series has been an icon of upscale sportiness since its introduction 45 years ago. This seventh-generation sedan looks poised to further that tradition with less weight, more interior space, improved aerodynamics, and more tech, including BMW’s gesture recognition system, that allows you to control some features just by waving your finger in the air. \nMyriad variants will be available, but we’re most looking forward to this M550i xDrive. With a 465 horsepower twin-turbocharged V-8 engine, an 8-speed transmission, and all-wheel-drive, it will surge from 0-60 m.p.h. in under 4.0 seconds. Until the new M5 is unveiled, this is the high Five to have. Mercedes-AMG GT C Image courtesy of Mercedes Benz \nThe AMG GT is Mercedes-Benz’s best effort yet at a pure sports car, splitting the balance between the brutish retro insanity like its recent gullwinged SLS, and compliant machismo of the current SL. Like its target rival, the Porsche 911, the GT comes as coupe or convertible, and in various outputs. \nCombining the flared fenders, larger wheels and tires, active rear steering, and active aerodynamics of its demented brother the GT R, with an ever so slightly less murderous engine tuning, the GT C manages to massage 550 hp out of the 4-liter twin-turbo V-8. Go for the limited Edition 50 package, celebrating AMG’s 50th birthday, and get yours coated in Graphite Grey paint on the outside, and silver diamond-quilted leather inside. Audi (RS) Q8 Image courtesy of Audi \nAudi has some of the cleanest coupe design on the contemporary market, including the A5, A7, and R8. Now it is attempting to coupe-ify its top SUV, and we can’t argue. This Q8 takes a Q7 and gives it the fastback rear and upgraded interior panache that has become a popular means to add cost by adding looks. \nAudi has slotted a gasoline-electric hybrid into this truck for launch, giving it a total of 443 hp . That’s a delicious amount of ponies, though were we in their product planning department, we’d shoehorn in the twin-turbo V8 from the RS7—the one that makes 605 hp —and call the resulting beast the RS Q8. Presto: a Bentley Bentayga for half the price. Bentley Continental GT Supersports Image courtesy of Bentley \nIn the mid-Twenties, just after the first Bentley automobile was unveiled, the British brand was already dominating the international racing circuit, winning the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race five times by 1930. That sporting heritage remains a powerful part of Bentley’s identity, and nowhere is that more evident than in this outrageous sledgehammer. \nHoused behind a blunted black-finished grille is a twin-turbocharged 12-cylinder engine that pumps out 700 horsepower , making it the most potent Bentley automobile ever built. Go-fast bits like lightweight 21-inch forged alloy wheels, an adaptable rear wing, and a titanium exhaust system allow the three-ton (yes, you read that right) coupe to hit 60 m.p.h. in a blistering 3.4 seconds and reach a preposterous top speed of 209 m.p.h.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T05:04:52.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
