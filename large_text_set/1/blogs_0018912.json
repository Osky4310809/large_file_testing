Liverpool went 2-0 down before drawing level and losing the game to a late Gylfi Sigurdsson goal (Photo: Getty) \nHe praises Klopp's men for their performances against the top six, and points out that they are unbeaten in games against them. \nBut suggests the players have to apply themselves in the same way against teams battling further down the league if they are to be serious title contenders. poll loading Is there an \"attitude and application\" problem at Liverpool? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T16:49:51.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
