When writing the song, I was imagining what it must feel like for someone to escape a horrendous situation, whether personal or political and to finally feel free. \nIt has been impossible to sit back and watch the state of the current political climate and to not feel moved to write about it - even if it is hidden inside a 3 minute pop song. \nThe video itself was very much a collaborative project with my longtime team. We wanted to capture a flavour of how I am as a live performer with movement and dance. \nWhat are you listening to at the moment? \nWhen I am writing my own music I tend to have my head in the sand and I don't really listen to much else. But I am really enjoying Christine and the Queens at the moment. \nWhat are your plans for 2017? \nI am finishing the final tracks for my new album right now, with my friend and co-producer Jay Glover, which will be released towards the end of summer. I have already confirmed a few festivals and I will be touring the album at the end of the year too. \nWhat was the first gig you played and what’s been the best so far? \nMy first ever gig was to about 10 people at The Dublin Castle in London and my best: probably supporting Belle and Sebastian at The Barrowlands back home in Glasgow with my family watching in the crowd.
