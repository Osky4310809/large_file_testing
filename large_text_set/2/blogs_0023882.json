Some faith groups believe baptism accomplishes the washing away of sin . Others consider baptism a form of exorcism from evil spirits. Still others teach that baptism is an important step of obedience in the believer’s life, yet only an acknowledgment of the salvation experience already accomplished--baptism itself has no power to cleanse or save from sin. This perspective is called \"Believer's Baptism:\" The Meaning of Baptism \nA general definition for the word baptism is “a rite of washing with water as a sign of religious purification and consecration.” This rite was practiced frequently in the Old Testament. It signified purity or cleansing from sin and devotion to God. Since baptism was first instituted in the Old Testament many have practiced it as a tradition yet have not fully understood its significance and meaning. New Testament Baptism \nIn the New Testament , the significance of baptism is seen more clearly. John the Baptist was sent by God to spread the news of the coming Messiah— Jesus Christ . John was directed by God (John 1:33) to baptize those who accepted his message. \nJohn’s baptism was called “a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.” Mark 1:4 (NIV) . Those baptized by John acknowledged their sins and professed their faith that through the coming Messiah they would be forgiven. Baptism is significant in that it represents the forgiveness and cleansing from sin that comes through faith in Jesus Christ. The Purpose of Baptism Water Baptism identifies the believer with the Godhead – Father, Son and Holy Spirit . \n“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Matthew 28:19 (NIV) Water Baptism identifies the believer with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection. \n“When you came to Christ, you were \"circumcised,\" but not by a physical procedure. It was a spiritual procedure--the cutting away of your sinful nature. For you were buried with Christ when you were baptized. And with him you were raised to a new life because you trusted the mighty power of God, who raised Christ from the dead.” Colossians 2:11-12 (NLT) \n“We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.” Romans 6:4 (NIV) Water Baptism is an act of obedience for the believer. It should be preceded by repentance, which simply means “change.” It is turning from our sin and selfishness to serve the Lord. It means placing our pride, our past and all of our possessions before the Lord. It is giving the control of our lives over to Him. \n\"Peter replied, 'Each of you must turn from your sins and turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.' Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church--about three thousand in all.” Acts 2:38, 41 (NLT) Water Baptism is a public testimony - the outward confession of an inward experience. In baptism, we stand before witnesses confessing our identification with the Lord. Water Baptism is a picture representing profound spiritual truth : \nDeath - “I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me.” Galatians 2:20 (NIV) \nResurrection - “We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father, we too may live a new life. If we have been united with Him like this in His death, we will certainly also be united with Him in His resurrection.” Romans 6:4-5 (NIV) \n“He died once to defeat sin, and now he lives for the glory of God. So you should consider yourselves dead to sin and able to live for the glory of God through Christ Jesus. Do not let sin control the way you live; do not give in to its lustful desires. Do not let any part of your body become a tool of wickedness, to be used for sinning. Instead, give yourselves completely to God since you have been given new life. And use your whole body as a tool to do what is right for the glory of God.\" Romans 6:10-13 (NLT) \nCleansing - “And this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also – not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” I Peter 3:21 (NIV) \n“But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.” I Corinthians 6:11 (NIV) More Christian Baptism Resources", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:58:26.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
