However, Togias says AAP was one of the members of the coordinating committee of the new guidelines, and they are in full support of adopting them for use among pediatricians. ID: 10272841 5. Before introducing peanuts to their infant, parents and caregivers should meet with a pediatrician to discuss the new guidelines and assess the infant’s risk of developing a peanut allergy.

Peanut allergies are a growing health problem, and there is no treatment or cure. View this image ›\nMichellegibson / Via gettyimages.com Currently, 2% of chlidren in the US have a peanut allergy. A person develops a peanut allergy when they get exposed to peanuts and their body makes antibodies which attach to immune cells. The next time that person eats peanuts, it triggers an immune response that can result in a severe or life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\nScientists are still investigating why some people develop severe allergies and others don’t, but the new findings on prevention are a big step forward. “The most common theory is that at a very young age, the immune system is still developing its ability to recognize what’s bad and what’s not, so early introduction helps the immune system get acquainted,” Togias says.\nID: 10273271 7. “Preventing the development of peanut allergy will improve and save lives and lower healthcare costs,” NIH director Dr. Anthony Fauci states in the report. People who live with a peanut allergy and their caregivers must be constantly vigilant and avoid any foods or environments where they could be exposed to peanuts. Additionally, many of those same people have had to cope with last year’s price increase of the EpiPen , a lifesaving injection to treat anaphylaxis.\nThe guidelines are targeted at healthcare providers, like pediatricians or family practice physicians, who can work with parents to introduce peanut-containing foods to infants. Researchers hope this new practice will ultimately prevent the development of a peanut allergy in susceptible children and lower the prevalence of peanut allergies in the US.\n“Even if we can cut the current rate of 2% in half, then we have a huge number of children who get protection from a lifelong, unfortunate allergy,” Togias says.\nID: 10272630 ", "external_links": ["https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/AAP-Joins-in-Interim-Guidance-on-Introduction-of-Peanuts-for-High-Risk-Infants.aspx", "http://www.aappublications.org/news/2017/01/05/PeanutAllergy010517", "https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/food-allergy-causes-prevention", "http://www.gettyimages.com/license/497286886", "http://www.gettyimages.com/license/531556372"], "published": "2017-01-06T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:19:55.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
