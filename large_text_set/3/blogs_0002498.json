Claire McCaskill had some memory problems pertaining to meetings and phone calls that took place in the last few years. This morning, Sen. Chuck Schumer‚Äôs memory issues were of a more personal nature: Schumer just said: \"I am not a lawy..\" then realized, yes, he is a lawyer. \nPivoted to say \"legal expert.\" \n‚Äî Jim Swift (@JSwiftTWS) March 2, 2017 \nWhoops! \n‚Äî Josh Hammer (@josh_hammer) March 2, 2017 \nFrequent lying can make it difficult to remember the truth. @JSwiftTWS I like how the \"I'm not a lawyer\" bit has become a way to connect yourself to the masses. \n‚Äî Ashley Rae (@Communism_Kills) March 2, 2017 Schumer is fumbling on his lies. Ha ha ha. https://t.co/Tsm0623T6h \n‚Äî Casey Parker (@CaseyParksIt) March 2, 2017 @redsteeze So he's not a lawyer or a legal expert? And yet he's a \"lawmaker.\" That explains a lot. \n‚Äî Karen N (@KarenN101) March 2, 2017 \"I'm just a cave man‚Ä¶\" https://t.co/8Q5lGw8mZD \n‚Äî Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) March 2, 2017 @redsteeze looking forward to Gov. Cuomo's \"I am a lawyer, I am a legal expert, I am a gay hooker, I am Schumer, I am Sessions\" speech. \n‚Äî Anthony JamesüêÇ (@AJBulldis) March 2, 2017 So first the former Kentucky gov can't recall if he is Rep or Dem, and Schumer can't recall being a lawyer. Seems they have memory issues. https://t.co/3cGDMwwGPL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T19:50:05.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
