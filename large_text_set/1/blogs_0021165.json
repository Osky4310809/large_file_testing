He faces up to nine months in prison. Mr. Reed helped bring development to the capital city, but he has also faced criticism for its financial problems. Harrisburg, located along the banks of the Susquehanna River, is digging itself out of a mountain of debt. \nAdvertisement The failed Wild West museum was just one of the factors, including a disastrous effort to rebuild the city’s trash incinerator , that led to its current financial straits. Harrisburg filed for bankruptcy in 2011 , but a federal judge dismissed the suit . Mr. Reed originally faced 499 counts on a wide range of political corruption charges , but 305 were dropped in May because the statute of limitations had passed. The Pennsylvania attorney general’s office whittled the charges down to 114 in September. The charges to which Mr. Reed pleaded guilty concerned stolen letters, documents and photographs, ranging in value from $100 to $3,500. Mr. Reed, once nicknamed Harrisburg’s “mayor for life,” was largely credited with much of its development. Under his watch, the city added a minor-league baseball team and created a park around it, transformed a bleak downtown corridor into a night-life hub and built Harrisburg University of Science and Technology, a new four-year college. “Today’s proceeding does not, in any way, affect nor take away from any of that progress,” Mr. Reed said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:55:43.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
