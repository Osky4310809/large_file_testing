The lens will transform you into a more Muppet-y state with feathers, pink and blue eyeshadow and a felt beak, but be sure to sing your ABCs for full effect.\nDuck-face bird.\nOverly excited bird.\nSEE ALSO: A puppeteer's personal story about bringing Sesame Street's first autistic Muppet to life\nThe Big Bird lens marks Sesame Street 's first official foray into the filters of Snapchat. (Although, you know Elmo would love the dog face lens.) Sesame Street reaches millions of fans across various social platforms, but the partnership with Snapchat needed the perfect moment to materialize. And what better moment than Big Bird blowing out six candles on a birdseed cake?\nSesame Street also hopes to use the Big Bird Snapchat lens to raise awareness around its Yellow Feather Fund , which launched in 2016 and supplies educational materials to children in need both in the U.S. and around the world.\nAs for what Big Bird thinks about everyone on Snapchat celebrating his birthday, he says, \"Well, I donâ€™t need presents for my birthday. Instead, I want all of my friends to help me help kids around the world. Helping each other would be the best gift ever.\"\nThe Big Bird lens will be available on Snapchat from March 22-24.\nSo while we now know what us mere humans would look like as Big Bird, we also wondered what the rest of the Sesame Street gang might look like on Snapchat.\nImage: Mashable composite:shutterstock/snapchat\nImage: Mashable composite:shutterstock/snapchat\nImage: Mashable composite:shutterstock/snapchat\nWATCH: Simply Delicious Thoughts About Food With Cookie Monster", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8xDrvsd0ZtcIHVSFlfVfngMFnDE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F422167%2Ffbdb8873-eb7a-4e65-883e-a5bbdf94ea95.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mqjfoV2N-WjmXdaXxZ2mxx6IGEw=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F422651%2Fa8bd68d7-1b9f-4d73-bb15-1162718bf600.JPG", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/thWfXD8d_OcAVakaiF8kakoT1ZE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F422163%2Fd9186ba7-d802-459f-a935-c1983f022256.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CInTBmJo5ubJ20MIV-xXmN_eKf0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F422165%2Fe1e96850-2e6a-407c-83a5-6802647b93b8.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UUzZCXuoOxf6xSX0cxBTYddeTSE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F422647%2Fdf0034b9-8d7b-431f-b8d2-970d4edd16fd.JPG", "http://www.yellowfeatherfund.org/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/APQkezF9baYqCx5vbIqM2iA6oN0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F422167%2Ffbdb8873-eb7a-4e65-883e-a5bbdf94ea95.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-GxYnnekvenHeulyx-cn3KYvSpY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F422163%2Fd9186ba7-d802-459f-a935-c1983f022256.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/C0Jb1m5Zp7YjGoQWuTm4l2VCZcY=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F422165%2Fe1e96850-2e6a-407c-83a5-6802647b93b8.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-22T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:24:18.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
