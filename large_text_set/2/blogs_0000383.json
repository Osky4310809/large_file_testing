Must have realised what a disastrous move it would be for Tories. \n— Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) February 2, 2017 \nAsked if he thought the Scottish government had a mandate to hold a second independence referendum, Fallon said: “No, where would that come from? They [the SNP] lost seats last May.” \nHe said Sturgeon should respect the result of the 2014 referendum in which 55 percent of Scots voted to remain part of the UK. \nFallon’s comments come after Sturgeon warned she will decide in the coming weeks whether to call another independence referendum after talks with Prime Minister Theresa May failed to her resolve concerns about Brexit. \n“We have no plans to help them [the SNP government] hold a second referendum,” Fallon said. \n“She [the First Minister] is constantly asking us to respect the SNP Government but she has to respect the decision of Scotland to stay inside the UK in 2014 and the decision of the UK to leave the EU. Respect works two ways,” Fallon added. \nDETAILS TO FOLLOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:43:50.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
