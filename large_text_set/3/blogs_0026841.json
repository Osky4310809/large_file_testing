Loren Legarda said yesterday. \nTonight at 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., Filipinos were also urged to participate in Earth Hour and become “environment warriors.” \nAccording to Legarda, the Philippines will become the 138th state party to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change after the Philippine Mission to the United Nations deposited the country’s Instrument of Accession to the UN Treaty Section on March 23. \nIt will enter into force for the Philippines after 30 days or on Earth Day itself on April 22. \n“It will also mark a great start to our journey towards a resilient and sustainable future,” Legarda said. \n“The Paris Agreement’s ultimate goal is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is our commitment to survive and thrive. This is in fulfillment of our intergenerational responsibility,” she said.   \nThe senator chairs the Senate committee on climate change and is the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) Global Champion for Resilience. \nShe said “a whole-of-society approach” is important to effectively implement the agreement and ensure that other nations also keep their respective commitments. \nLegarda said the country’s representatives in the climate talks could now actively participate in the negotiations, particularly in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. \n“We will exercise governance, oversight, leadership and decision-making and continue to be a strong actor in advancing our country’s interests. Developed nations must provide the necessary assistance for climate adaptation and mitigation to developing nations, especially the vulnerable ones like the Philippines,” Legarda said. Earth Hour about unity \nSen. Sonny Angara, for his part, called on the Filipino youth to be “environment warriors” as he urged the entire nation to join tonight’s Earth Hour. \nThis year’s Earth Hour switch-off event focuses on the youth’s role as future climate leaders. \nAngara encouraged the youth to use social media to propagate environment protection. \nHe said other sectors must also conduct continuous clean up drive to rid communities of pollutant waste materials and protect them from environmental plunderers. \n“Earth Hour is more than just how much energy is saved when we switch off our lights for one hour. It is about inspiring people to unite against the destruction of the environment and climate change,” Angara said. \nInterior Secretary Ismael Sueno also issued a memorandum circular to all local officials to advocate and widen public participation in this year’s Earth Hour. \nBut Sueno stressed local government units (LGUs) must initiate stronger action to mitigate climate change and its effects. \n“We all live in only one planet Earth, we are all personally accountable to take better care of it by switching to low carbon lifestyle,” Sueno said. \nSueno said LGUs could dim or switch off non-essential lights in public places, documenting their activities to prove their commitment and encourage the private sector to do the same. \nEarth Hour is an annual global environmental event aimed at encouraging individuals, communities, households and businesses to turn off their non-essential lights for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. on the last Saturday of March, as a symbol of their commitment to the planet. \n“The increasing environment and climate change awareness among our youth is noticeable. Our youth should lead in taking concrete actions to save the environment, which is now on the verge of massive destruction because of unscrupulous people who wantonly and with impunity destroy and pollute our environment for their interests,” he said. – With Emmanuel Tupas  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T02:11:37.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
