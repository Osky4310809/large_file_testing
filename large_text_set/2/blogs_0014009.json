In the end, I don’t think we should play their game. Have a hearing and vote,” said Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. Advertisement - story continues below \nSenator Chris Coons, D-Del., concurred, saying, “I’m not going to do to President Trump’s nominee what the Republicans in the Senate did to President Obama’s. I will push for a hearing and I will push for a vote.” \nDemocrats are expected to grill Gorsuch on a variety of legal issues, and the conservative judge will need at least eight Democratic votes in order to clear the Senate. The hearing is expected to last three to four days. \nRepublicans argue that Democrats are attempting to apply unrealistic standards for Gorsuch, standards that were not put in place for former President Barack Obama’s two successful nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. \n“Judge Gorsuch has met every demand placed on him by the Minority. He’s a mainstream judge. He’s displayed independence,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley said in a statement. “He’s met with dozens of senators who have nothing but positive things to say. He is well-qualified and respected.” Advertisement - story continues below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:30:02.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
