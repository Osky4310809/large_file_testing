These restrictions affect inbound flights to the UK from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.\nPrimark issue urgent recall over fears that children's leggings may be deadly It includes transfer flights, so if you travelled with a connection in Istanbul, for example, you would be affected.\nBritish carriers are part of the ban, including British Airways, easyJet, Jet2.com, Monarch, Thomas Cook and Thomson.\nOverseas airlines which will be included are Turkish Airlines, Pegasus Airways, Atlas-Global Airlines, Middle East Airlines, EgyptAir, Royal Jordanian, Tunis Air and Saudia.\nSome BA flights will be affected (Picture: Getty) What is included in the ban? Any electronic device larger than 16cm by 9.3cm by 1.5cm.\nThat means laptops, iPads, consoles, cameras, Kindles and other e-readers, hybrid devices such as the Microsoft Surface and iPad Pro, as well as the new Nintendo Switch gaming system are all part of it.\n\nCan I still take my phone? Yes, phones will usually still be okay because they are smaller. It depends on whether they fit into the dimensions given above.\nMost smartphones, including the iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S7, will still be eligible to travel in cabin baggage.\niPhones are still allowed (Picture: Getty) What else is still allowed? Most things. Nothing has changed, except for the new ban on electronics.\nSo liquids over 100ml are still banned in the cabin, along with more obviously dangerous items like firearms, knives, aerosols and lighter fluid.\nCan I still check in my laptop? Yes, you can still take it on the plane if it goes in the hold rather than hand luggage.\nWhy is my computer okay in the hold but not the cabin?  \nFirstly, it would be more difficult for a terrorist to detonate a bomb if they didn’t have it with them.\nGirl, 15, sexually assaulted by 6 men on Facebook Live - but nobody reported to police Secondly, if a bomb went off in the hold, it would be bad but not necessarily catastrophic.\nHowever, if a terrorist sat by a window and detonated their bomb in the cabin, it could blast a hole in the side of the plane which could bring the whole aircraft down.\nLast year the insurgent group al-Shabaab smuggled an explosive-filled laptop on a flight out of Mogadishu in Somalia.\nWhat about duty free? Thomas Cook said they believed the ban would apply to duty free items bought at the airport, so people should be aware before making a purchase.\nWhat led to the new restrictions? The ban is believed to be in response to information that terrorists were developing the means to hide explosives within a device like a laptop.\nHowever, it isn’t clear whether there was a specific plot identified.\nWhen is the ban coming into force? No specific date has been set but it will be in the next few days as airlines sort out how to implement it.\nPassengers should be prepared for it to be effective immediately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:47:44.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
