Stranahan based his report on increasingly discredited evidence, as well as a tweet made by President Trump on March 5th regarding the hacked DNC server: What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 \nIt's true... the DNC did not allow the FBI to inspect the allegedly hacked servers; instead they used a Google-funded cybersecurity firm called CrowdStrike - which FBI director James Comey referred to in testimony Monday as a \"highly respected private company\" despite several reports casting serious doubt on their analysis. Furthermore, CrowdStrike was accused of using false information by the government of Ukraine in a separate December report which concluded that Russia hacked Ukrainian military hardware using the same malware allegedly employed in the DNC hack. \nIn light of the fact that the US election hacking narrative revolves around an increasingly questionable report published by a private company caught in a recent lie, plus the DNC's refusal to let the FBI inspect the servers in question (which President Trump tweeted about) - Breitbart's Lee Stranahan had planned to bring the issue up with White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer. Instead, Matthew Boyle - Breitbart's DC political Editor, ordered Stranahan to stand down and stay away from the White House. \nIn other words; don't shed light on major developments which could unravel the DNC's witch hunt. Stranahan has taken to Periscope to tell his side of the story: Breitbart's WH Correspondent Lee Stranahan's job in jeopardy. Ordered by Breitbart editor @mboyle1 not to go into WH to ask a question. Why? pic.twitter.com/fG7D7YWgu6 \n— ZeroPointNow (@ZeroPointNow) March 22, 2017 \nHere's what Stranahan wanted to ask: @mboyle1 (Breitbart's WA editor) - WHY did you order @stranahan not to ask @SeanSpicer this question that @realDonaldTrump tweeted 3/5? ???? pic.twitter.com/L95eAYGkDZ \n— ZeroPointNow (@ZeroPointNow) March 22, 2017 \nWithout hearing Breitbart editor Matthew Boyle's side, ordering Stranahan to stand down seems rather odd since the Russian hacking narrative - if deemed true by Congress, would be incredibly damaging to Trump's legitimacy as President - even if there was no collusion. \nScroll down for the cliffs notes on Stranahan's article (though I encourage you to read the whole thing ): The DNC Russian hacking claims rely entirely on a report by a private company the DNC hired called \"CrowdStrike\" (not mentioned in Stranahan's article: The Irvine, CA company was partially funded by Google, which led a $100M 'Series C' investment round ) CrowdStrike's report (\"Fancy Bear\") is highly speculative, inconclusive by most standards, and does not contain \"hard evidence\" per CrowdStrike Co-Founder Dmitri Alperovitch: \nThe firm suspects they may have targeted DNC employees with “spearphishing” emails. These are communications that appear legitimate — often made to look like they came from a colleague or someone trusted — but that contain links or attachments that when clicked on deploy malicious software that enables a hacker to gain access to a computer. “ But we don’t have hard evidence ,” Alperovitch said. The MSM ran with the \"Fancy Bear\" report in an attempt to delegitimize Trump: Starting in June of 2016 and continuing to this day, the DNC, Washington Post, New York Times, and other MSM outlets have been using the CrowdStrike report to stage a smear campaign against Donald Trump in an attempt to delegitimize the President while providing an excuse for Hillary Clinton's loss. Cybersecurity experts and respected journalists have cast serious doubt on it's the report's validity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T12:22:45.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
