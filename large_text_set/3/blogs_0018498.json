My mother’s in my workplace.’ But all of that annoyance needs to be offset by a real love.”\nBriga Heelan and Andrea Martin on Great News . Eric Liebowitz/NBC This is Tracey’s first TV show, but Kathy, for one, always knew her daughter was destined for greatness.\n“When [she was] a little girl, her and her sister wrote little shows and I used to say, ‘You’re gonna be on Saturday Night Live one day,’ ” says Kathy.\n“Well, I wasn’t,” replies Tracey.\n“No,” admits her mother. “Well, close. You work with Tina.”\nGreat News is slated to premiere April 25 on NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:34:43.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
