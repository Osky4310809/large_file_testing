Use these to impress your friends over the weekend. \nDisneyland has been a part of your childhood since it's opening on July 17, 1955. And while you probably know all about the hidden Mickeys and that Uncle Walt haunts his old apartment , there's still a lot you don't know about the park's formative years. So put on your Mickey Mouse ears and read on! People Counterfeited Tickets to the Opening \n(source) \nWhen Disneyland opened on July 17, 1955, Disney printed 6000 tickets for their various employees, contractors, and families, in addition to tickets for the press and sponsors. But the tickets were easily forged, and so 28,000 people ended up crashing the park's opening day. Among those attendees was an 11-year-old named George Lucas who would one day grow up to be... George Lucas. It Was Smaller and Cheaper \n(source) \nBack in the day, admission to Disneyland cost $3.50, it was closed on Mondays and Tuesdays during the off-season, and there were only 18 attractions. And surprisingly, 14 of those O.G. attractions are still open to this day, even though at least some of them will presumably be torn down to make space for a Moana ride. There Used to be a Bra Shop \n(source) \nA Hollywood-Maxwell Intimate Apparel shop used to be open on Disneyland's Main Street. The store had an exhibit of underwear through the ages and even a mechanical robot dressed in stockings and a corset who introduced himself as the Wonderful Wizard of Bras (pun intended). The store closed in 1956, but for six months, it was the happiest place in the happiest place on Earth. Nikita Khrushchev Threw a Sh*t Fit When He Couldn't Go \n(source) \nWhen he visited the U.S. in 1959, communist leader Nikita Khrushchev found he wasn't able to visit Disneyland due to safety concerns. Kruschev lashed out: \"And I say, I would very much like to go and see Disneyland. But then, we cannot guarantee your security, they say. Then what must I do? Commit suicide? What is it? Is there an epidemic of cholera there or something? Or have gangsters taken hold of the place that can destroy me?\" Hell hath no fury like a Russian scorned! Steve Martin Worked There \n(source) \nBefore Steve Martin made you laugh in The Jerk , he entertained you at Disneyland (had you been alive at the time and happened to take a trip to Disneyland). A young Steve Martin sold guidebooks and worked in the magic shop at the park. What a wild and crazy guy! \nWhat's your favorite part of Disneyland?
