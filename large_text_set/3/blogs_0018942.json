Thankfully, the television gods have listened to our pleas. It was just announced that Captain Planet episodes will be available through digital download , which makes our hearts soar. With this news, we finally have the perfect way to celebrate Earth Day !\nIf you’re only slightly familiar with Captain Planet , here’s what the show is all about: The full show, likely known best by most as Captain Planet and the Planeteers , aired on TBS back in the very early ’90s.\nThe premise? Well, it taught us all about keeping the Earth safe by advocating environmentalism. There’s a good chance you learned all about recycling thanks to the Planeteers.\nWho can we thank for this resurrection? Well, Cartoon Network of course! The show aired for six seasons, which was pretty impressive back then. (Sure, the name was tweaked a bit throughout the run of the show, but they all dealt with environmental rings and blue flying superhero.) They’ll all be available for purchase on April 10th.\nAlmost every digital retailer will be offering them, from Amazon Video and iTunes to the Playstation Store. Full seasons range from $9.99 to $14.99 — a small cost, when you think about how educational the show really is.\nPlus, hey — if the Leonardo DiCaprio film version that was teased a while back ever becomes a reality, it’ll be nice to have caught up on the series beforehand.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:04:19.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
