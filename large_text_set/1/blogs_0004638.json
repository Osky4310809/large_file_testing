Both variants are powered by the 2.4 litre 2GD-FTV turbodiesel engine that produces 150 hp at 3,400 rpm and 400 Nm of torque between 1,600 and 2,000 rpm. The mill is paired with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission, along with a four-wheel drive system. \nCompared to the 2.4G 4×4 variants, the 2.4G STD units do not come with a body stripe and door visors, an emergency kit and spare wheel lock, and there is a 2-DIN head unit instead of a 6.1-inch touchscreen infotainment unit. \nClick to enlarge \nIn other areas, the 2.4G STD MT 4×4 gets a six-way manually-adjustable driver seat, while the 2.4G STD AT 4×4 is fitted with an eight-way power-adjustable one instead. Additionally, the 2.4G STD MT follows the 2.4G MT as it gets fabric seat upholstery, while the 2.4G STD AT gets leather seats just like the 2.4G AT. \nA minor thing to note is the absence of a foot lamp and digital video recorder in the 2.4G STD AT, which is standard on the 2.4G AT. Safety-wise, only the automatic variants of the 2.4G STD, 2.4G and 2.8G come with Active Traction Control (A-TRC), Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC). \nAs you can tell from the attached spec sheet, everything else remains largely similar to the 2.4G variants, including the 17-inch alloys, multi-info display, keyless operation, leather-wrapped steering wheel, three airbags, reverse sensor and drive mode switch.
