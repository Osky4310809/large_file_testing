The leaks aren’t stopping there, though. Earlier today, reported images of an LG G6 prototype have leaked out, confirming some, but not quite all, of its previous rumors of this next flagship device.\nSee also: LG G6: all the rumors in one place 2 weeks ago \nThe images were first posted at Droid Life , and they were clearly taken with much haste and secrecy from the photos’ creator. They show a rather dirty looking large screen, and it’s not clear if the display has the curved corners that were shown with the previous LG G6 image leak. They do, however, show that the device has a very tiny bezel, with almost none on the sides of the screen.\nThe image on the back side shows a development shell, but the phone’s dual cameras are indeed visible, along with what looks like its headphone jack. An image of this alleged prototype’s bottom shows a speaker and a USB Type-C connection. We do not have any independent confirmation that these photos are indeed of a prototype G6, so do take them with a pinch of salt.\n\nThe new images come just a few weeks before the company is scheduled to hold a press event in Barcelona, Spain on February 26 , the day before the official start of 2017’s Mobile World Congress . LG has confirmed that the display on the G6 will feature a 5.7-inch QHD+ screen with an 18:9 aspect ratio , while unconfirmed rumors claim it will be the first third-party smartphone that will support the Google Assistant AI . LG has promised the phone will be made with new safety measures designed to reduce overheating with the use of heat pipes, in an apparent attempt not to have the same issues that occurred with the ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 7 .\nWe will be on the ground to attend LG’s MWC 2017 press event and will have first-hand coverage and impressions of what the company will be showing off at the trade show, so stay tuned.\nNext: What to expect from MWC 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:22:29.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
