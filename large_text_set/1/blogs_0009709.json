The moment in question? The teleprompter was (briefly) out. (Fallon did a fake trip and improv’ed his way through it—including an extended Chris Rock impression— until a new one was rolled in.) The remarks that followed were certainly more focused on current events than most would have expected, given Fallon’s remarks last week, when he told Matt Lauer that he wouldn’t be “heavily political,” and that in fact, “you know, none of my stuff is that political. There’s other ways to be creative with that.” And to that end, there was a pretty killer La La Land spoof cold open, featuring Nicole Kidman, Amy Adams, Rami Malek, and extended song and dance sequence with Justin Timberlake, and more: \n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) January 9, 2017 \n\nBelow, the best jokes from Fallon’s opening monologue. \n“People wonder what it would be like if King Joffrey had lived! Well, in 12 days we’re gonna find out.” \n“You may remember Manchester by the Sea as the only thing more depressing from 2016 than 2016.” \n“We all remember Matt Damon’s greatest acting role, telling Ben Affleck he liked Batman vs. Superman .” \n“The film Florence Foster Jenkins is nominated; the character has been dubbed the world’s worst opera singer, and even she turned down Trump’s inauguration.” \n“All the ballots for tonight’s nominations are being calculated by Ernst, Young, and Putin.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T06:26:58.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
