Elizabeth Warren have collected more than $250,000 for the Democrat's re-election campaign since the Republican-led Senate voted to silence her Tuesday night. \nMoveOn.org officials said more than 9,000 members stepped up to financially support Warren after the Senate's Republican leaders said she had violated Senate rules by \"impugning the motives\" of Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who is President Trump's pick for attorney general. \nWarren's objectionable act: reading aloud on the Senate floor a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King, the widow of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., opposing Sessions' nomination to a federal judgeship. King wrote that the Alabama Republican had used his then-position as a U.S. attorney to intimidate elderly black voters. \n\"By standing with Elizabeth Warren, we're standing up against that kind of bigotry,\" MoveOn officials said in a statement Wednesday. \"We're standing up for freedom of speech. And we're standing up for something else that is under threat in the age of Trump: Truth. Together, let's show that when our friends speak truth to power, a powerful movement rises to stand by their side.\" \nRead more: Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
