The group’s leader Sowon said, “Since all the members are of age now, we sometimes drink together.” She also confessed, “We sometimes drink in secret so that the manager who lives with us doesn’t know.” \nShe also revealed that they are responsible drinkers, saying, “I decide how much everyone should drink. I am always checking on how much the members are drinking. I’m afraid that they might cross over the line and things might become crazy, so I tell them to stop at appropriate times.” \nThe girls also chose Eunha their best alcohol drinker. Eunha said, “I like to mix soju and beer, or fruity drinks.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:52:54.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
