According to a People.com report, the retailer is launching a Brave Beauty in the Face of Cancer class later this week in over 40 cities across the U.S.\nThe 90-minute Sephora Brave Beauty in the Face of Cancer classes will focus on arming women (and men — all genders are invited) affected by cancer with techniques that will flatter and take care of their skin and hair. Plus, students can learn great makeup techniques that will help them down the road as they recover.\nBeing a model for first Brave Beauty class at Sephora World trade was truly an honor and something I will never forget ❤ thank you to everyone involved #awesomeness #sephora #sephoraworldtradecenter #sephorastands #cancersucks #inspirational #bravebeautyclasses #thankyou #love #beautytogether #sephorakop \nA post shared by @tuitej on Mar 18, 2017 at 9:39am PDT \nOne of the Sephora facilitators, Michelle, told People.com that as a survivor, this is exactly the type of work she believes in, “When I had it, I shut down and never spoke about the fact that I had cancer. So I think this program was an eye opener that I can be an inspiration for others. I am so glad I am a part of it.” \nREMINDER: On March 26th, Sephora is hosting Brave Beauty in the Face of Cancer, a free 90 minute specialized beauty class for people affected by cancer.

The hope is, that students will feel free to talk openly about the intersections of their experiences with cancer, and their evolving beauty journey. Sephora is just there to provide people with more tools for their personal expression. \nThank you @sephora for the #BraveBeauty class in NYC this morning!
