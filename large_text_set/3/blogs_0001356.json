(NKJV) \nPsalm 119:9-11 How can a young person stay pure? By obeying your word. I have tried hard to find you—don’t let me wander from your commands. I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you. (NLT) \nPsalm 119:103-105 How sweet your words taste to me; they are sweeter than honey. Your commandments give me understanding; no wonder I hate every false way of life. Your word is a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path. (NLT) \nProverbs 3:5-6 Trust in the LORD with all your heartand lean not on your own understanding;in all your ways acknowledge him,and he will make your paths straight. (NIV) \nProverbs 19:21 Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the LORD's purpose that prevails. (NIV) \nRomans 8:28 And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. (NLT) \n1 Timothy 4:12 Don’t let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity.
