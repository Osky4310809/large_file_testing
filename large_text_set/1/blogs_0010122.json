This man recently got into a heated argument with a general practitioner at a clinic in Edgefield Plains — an episode that he recorded on his phone and uploaded on Facebook. It was a bid to go viral and show \"how arrogant a Singapore clinic doctor can be\". \nGo viral it did, but not as he intended — folks firmly stood on the side of the doctor, and it was the man (and his wife) who was blamed for causing the unnecessary ruckus in the first place. He's since taken down the clip, but everything lives forever on the internet. \nIn case of TL;DW, here's each side of their story. You decide who's in the right (it's pretty obvious). \nPatient The man's daughter was having a fever with the temperature reaching up 39.5°C, causing his wife (from China) to be very anxious. As his wife's command of English wasn't very good, she wanted to get the right instructions and medicines for the child. \"She doesn't want to give the wrong medication to my daughter,\" he says. \nDoctor Apparently, the wife had been verbally harassing clinic staff after waiting in line for about an hour. She barged into the doctor's consultation room without permission (she hadn't even registered for an appointment). She started verbally abusing the doctor, calling him names and threatening him — it got to a point where the police had to be called in. Admittedly, the doctor said to the wife: \"This is not China. We have rules and protocols to see the doctor\". He suggests that if the man and his wife had been so anxious about their daughter's fever, they should have gone to the Accident & Emergency (A&E) department in the hospital. \nNo matter who you side with, you gotta agree that the argument got really... abnormal. \nDoctor: \"If you are busy, you cannot wait, you follow what normal people would do. If you do not follow what other normal people do, that means you are not normal\". \nMan: \"So you are saying that I am brainless?\" \nDoctor : \"I'm not saying you're brainless, I'm saying you're not normal\". \nMan: \"So I'm abnormal?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T15:19:00.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
