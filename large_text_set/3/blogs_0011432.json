I was convinced I was going to prison. I told my parents to tell the cops it was an accident, if they came. I hid in my room for half of that day. — ArchieParchie 2 GIF \n____ \nI played wow with a guy who was American, but lived in Japan. Then that tsunami hit, and none of us heard from him again. — anooblol \n____ \nI got a popup once that informed me I had underage pornography on my computer (which I did not) and the police were on their way to my house. It instructed me to call a 1-800 number. When I read the first line of “you have child pornography on your computer” my heart stopped beating and I froze. But then I was like “how would calling a 1-800 number help me?” It was then I realized it was a scam. Still pretty terrifying. — thanatos891 \n____ \nA stranger emailed me a video of myself (that I didn’t know was being taken, when I was 15). I never figured out who it was or why. — 97Chloe 3 GIF \n____ \nI was in high school, and I had swollen lymph nodes around my nether regions. I took pictures from all kinds of angles so I could show the doctor after school without having to expose myself in person. \nFast forward to computer class, and I’m logging into my google account to pull up my power point on the projector. As I’m trying to log into Drive, to my terror, I see 5 thumbnails of my junk displayed in the queue for auto-upload to Google+. \nLuckily, no one noticed. I was always the weirdo outcast kid, so if the other students caught wind that this happened, my life would have been over promptly. — cyntrix \n____ \nThere was multiple posts of me on some chan site asking people in my area if anyone had nudes of me and someone detailed a fantasy of raping me. The part that freaked me out is that they had taken pictures of my face off of social media. I deleted a massive amount of stuff online after that. — JupiterRat 4 GIF \n____ \nI sent a very degrading nudes of myself to a “woman” who turned out to be a man and threatened to send them to all of my fb friends and collegues if I don’t pay up. The moment that happened my heart dropped. But then I thought “Fuck it, my sexuality is none of their business”, and told the guy “lol get a job”. \nHe never sent them — igatrinit \n____ \nI opened my computer the one day to find a bunch of annoying prank-like things changed (wallpaper upside-down, icons shuffled around, mouse settings changed etc.) along with a .txt file on my desktop telling me I’d been hacked, how they did it, and tips to improve my security. I wasn’t even mad, though a little unnerved. — BaconBaron42 5 \n____ \nDoes over the phone count (from the Dial-up days)? \nI once was talking with my sister in the kitchen when the phone rang, caller ID said unknown number. \nI picked it up, and all I heard was a recording of our voices, saying something we had said just a minute earlier in our conversation. After about 15 seconds of it, I suddenly heard this loud static-y screeching noise and then the call cut out. \nI was thoroughly spooked. — grandioseplans \n____ \nNot quite scary but disturbing: a couple of years ago I disappeared and there were pictures of me on online news. (Fine now, mental health issue). They used my facebook profile pic. I started getting lots of creepy hey babe message and dickpics on facebook from.strange old men. I changed my pic and they stopped: the arseholes were recerse searching my pic from the news. Gross bastards. — Incantanto \n____ \nChecking my bank account. Damn near gives me a heart attack every time. — sinemetu23 Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T02:09:01.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
