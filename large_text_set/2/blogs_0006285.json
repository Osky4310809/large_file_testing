True, it can barely be labeled an item of clothing―the sheerness! the tininess!―but it immediately caused the internet to explode with questions: Did he lose a bet? Is this Stockholm syndrome? Is this proof that they're filming a music video? Is it a cry for help?   \n— Allie Jones (@allierileyjones) July 4, 2016 Most Popular But no, Tom Hiddleston explains in a new profile in March's GQ , it was none of the above. In fact, it was just kind of a joke―and a fluke thing that turned into a Big Thing that haunts him. The writer asks Hiddles―who she notes, is very earnest at all times―about Swift and the craziness rumors that surrounded them during their relationship: I ask if he wants to say anything about Australia, about the Fourth of July party at which he donned that fateful tank top, about the rumors that she thought he was too eager. Does he want to say anything about any of it? And here he puts down his fork, a bite of my steak still on it. He looks off into the middle distance, and here is what he says: \"The truth is, it was the Fourth of July and a public holiday and we were playing a game and I slipped and hurt my back. And I wanted to protect the graze from the sun and said, 'Does anyone have a T-shirt?' And one of her friends said, 'I've got this.' \" The friend pulled out the \"I ♥ T.S.\" tank top that Taylor's friends are contractually obligated to own. \"And we all laughed about it. It was a joke.\" So that's his statement on the entire relationship: an explanation of the tank top. \"It was a joke,\" he repeats. \"Among friends.\" Oh, Tom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:26:31.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
