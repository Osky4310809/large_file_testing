Unfortunately, it’s plagued by mediocre fuel-economy ratings, poor real-world efficiency, and snug third-row quarters. \nWhether hauling the kids around town or seeking adventure far from home, the all-new Acadia is a capable but wholly average family crossover. While there’s seating for up to seven passengers, it’s substantially smaller than its predecessor and now offers less room for people and cargo. The flip-up third row can accommodate kids, but adults will find it cramped. The cabin offers high-tech amenities such as touchscreen infotainment and 4G LTE connectivity , but it also suffers some refinement issues. Also, despite its trimmer physique, the Acadia’s fuel economy is disappointing . What’s New for 2017? \nAll new for 2017, the Acadia is now more compact than before—its wheelbase is shorter by 6.4 inches, its overall length shrinks by 7.2 inches, and it’s 3.5 inches narrower . It’s lighter, too, by about 700 pounds, which helps with both efficiency and drivability. GMC has modernized the blocky exterior with some softer edges; the cabin received a reworking that adds a much-improved infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, somewhat improved interior materials, and a classier design. For the first time, the Acadia has a four-cylinder engine as standard, but a V-6 is still available. Standard Feature Highlights \n• Keyless entry with push-button start• 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system• Leather steering wheel with audio controls• Tilting-and-telescoping steering column Trims and Options We'd Choose \nThe SLE-2 trim serves up the best bang for the buck. For $920, we’d also upgrade to the 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment display, which adds an eight-speaker Bose sound system and a multicolored information center. We’d order the strong 310-hp 3.6-liter V-6 engine, but we would stick with the front-wheel-drive Acadia since all-wheel drive adds $2000 to the bottom line. Our Acadia is ready for duty at a few bucks more than $38,000. In addition to the standard features, the SLE-2 adds: \n• An eight-way power driver’s seat• Heated driver’s and front-passenger seats• Fog lamps", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:44:16.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
