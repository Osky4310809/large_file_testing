Hector in Alberta, Canada. \nThe two are a man and a woman, who are both 32-years old, and are doctors with ties to Mass General Hospital. \nTheir names have not been released as Canadian law prohibits the released of accident victim names. \nSearchers said once it was safe enough, they quickly recovered the bodies. Car rented by 2 missing snowshoers from Boston in Canada (Image from CTV) \n“Within ten minutes of arriving we determined the location of the two subjects and we were able to dig and recover them from the avalanche,” said Grant Statham of Parks Canada. \nThe search began earlier this week when the pair missed check-out on Monday, and the motel notified the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The visitors’ rental vehicle was found snow-covered on 93 near Mt. Hector. \n“Hiked up the Mt. Hector trail and were able to determine two individuals had been caught in an avalanche,” said Cpl Curtis Peters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. \nStorms and avalanches delayed the recovery. \n“We used the helicopter and teams on the ground, but the avalanche risk was too high,” said Statham. \nLate Thursday, Parks Canada confirmed two avalanche beacons. Friday, the man and woman were found buried under 6 to 10 feet of Snow. Statham believes the pair was caught in the avalanche on Sunday. \n“The danger rating on that time is considerable which means dangerous avalanche conditions and human triggered avalanches are likely,” said Statham. \nWith that warning, only people with experience in back country travel are expected to go in. Statham didn’t know that pair’s training, but he said they were properly equipped. Parks Canada doesn’t close back country trails. Visitors make their own decision. \nOfficials said they have been in contact with the families. The families will now work with the Embassy to bring the bodies back to Boston.
