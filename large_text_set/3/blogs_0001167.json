NFL Network's Ian Rapoport first reported Berry and the Chiefs were close to an agreement on a six-year deal worth $78 million. ESPN's Adam Schefter confirmed Berry's deal, adding it includes $40 million in guaranteed money with a $20 million signing bonus. Per ESPN Stats & Info , Berry's $40 million in guaranteed money is the highest among current safeties. Berry provided a feel-good story during the 2015 season as he returned from cancer to assume his regular place in the Chiefs secondary. Not only did he play again, but he's continued to prove himself as one of the best safeties in football over the past two years. The 28-year-old University of Tennessee product racked up 61 combined tackles, 10 passes defended and two interceptions while appearing in all 16 games for the league's seventh-ranked defense in 2015. His play earned him a First Team All-Pro distinction for the second time in his career. Berry added 77 combined tackles and four picks in 2016 , including two he returned for touchdowns, en route to his fifth Pro Bowl and third All-Pro selections. He's a playmaker, plain and simple. Whether it's dropping down into the box to help in run support or serving as a ball hawk in the defensive backfield, he's capable of handling any role. His successful return initially made keeping him in the fold one of Kansas City's top priorities. After the team's 2015 playoff run ended with a loss to the New England Patriots , Berry discussed his hope of remaining with the franchise, as noted by Terez A. Paylor of the Kansas City Star . \"Obviously, this is family,\" Berry said. \"At the same time, we will sit down and talk about it when we talk about it, but right now I'm just thankful for my teammates, my coaches and everybody that has something to do with me being back on the field this year. This is something special.\" Kansas City used the non-exclusive franchise tag on Berry in early March to provide some clarity. Kevin Patra of NFL.com noted that set the defensive back's salary at $10.8 million for 2016. He didn't immediately sign the tender, though. Instead, he continued to push for a long-term agreement, but the sides couldn't come to terms before the July 15 deadline. So he decided to hold out from training camp since the team couldn't fine a player not under contract. The star defender returned in late August in time for the new regular season after skipping the vast majority of the preseason work. The decision clearly didn't impact his play. In the end, Berry and the Chiefs were able to reach a long-term agreement to keep him in the only professional uniform he's ever known for a while longer. He has earned the deal with his performance since the team used the fifth overall pick to select him in 2010. To go from having such an uncertain future to re-establishing himself as one of the league's most valuable defenders and receiving a contract extension in such a short period of time is an amazing story. It carries an impact far beyond the boundaries of the football field. Looking ahead, Berry should continue to serve as an eraser in the secondary for the Chiefs as well as one of the team's key emotional leaders in the locker room.
