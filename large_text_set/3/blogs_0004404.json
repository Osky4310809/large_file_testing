Before moving home with her mum (Photo: XPOSUREPHOTOS.COM) \nRecords show it was bought for £169,995 in November 2013. \nJane – who is currently facing a drink-driving charge – was offering items of furniture on Facebook in the run-up to the house sale. \nOn December 13 – three days before the house sale was apparently finalised – she posted photos of a red sofa and white table, chairs and TV unit with the message: “Anyone interested? Message me.” Jane Park became a lottery winner after buying a ticket for the first time (Photo: Sunday Mirror) Jane Park won the cash in August 2013 (Photo: PA) She is due to face a drink-drive trial this week \nContacted by potential buyers, she replied: “Everyone’s mailed me 150 for table n chairs and 80 for TV unit. Needs to be picked up before Friday in Prestonpans x.” \nIt’s understood Jane was renting out the property for a while before putting it on the market in around September. \nShe moved back into mother Linda’s home in Edinburgh’s Prestonfield area after complaining she felt lonely. \nSince her win, Jane, who was Britain’s youngest lottery millionaire, has splashed a fortune on designer handbags and holidays and £4,500 on breast enhancement surgery. Jane has decided to move back in with her mum (Photo: @janeparkx/Twitter) \nA spokesman for Jane said last night: “Jane has a strong team of financial advisers who help manage her portfolio of investments wisely. \n“From time to time, this will involve releasing funds from one profitable venture to enable her to reinvest into bigger projects.” \nJane’s drink-driving case was thrown into chaos last month after Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told CCTV of the alleged incident had been “destroyed”. \nShe faced a dash back to Scotland in time for her court appearance after missing a flight back from Tenerife because she was celebrating Hibs’ derby win over Hearts. \nShe denies drink-driving at a McDonald’s drive-thru and will face trial this week.
