Giphy \nIn a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight at his Super Bowl LIFEWTR commercial launch party over in Houston, Texas on Friday, John talked about the prospects of his daughter Luna, 9 months, eventually hanging out with Blue Ivy, 5, and how excited he is over the idea of these playdates. \nJohn Legend provided a legendary response and said, \nHopefully some good music will come out of it. Who knows? \nWho knows? \nUh, dial up Beyoncé and Jay Z , and make this happen. All of me loves all of this idea of these two little ones collaborating in the future. Giphy \nToo true, Chrissy! \nSeriously, get a calendar for 2020, and put this hangout in the books. Sure, Blue will be 8 and Luna will be 3 and some change, but in time, they’ll become besties. \nI just know it. \nOn the subject of Beyonce’s recent announcement she’d be having twins in a half-naked Instagram post, John said, \nI’m happy for them. It’s a beautiful thing. They already know that, though. They already have a wonderful daughter. They know what it feels like, and I’m excited for them. \nSo far, the responses to Jay Z and Bey’s pregnancy announcement have ranged from Nicki Minaj trolling us with her own baby bump picture to concern over whether or not Queen B will still be up to headline Coachella . \nBut this? This is the best news I’ve heard all damn day. The Legend-Carter alliance would be a powerhouse of musicality. \nAlthough, if Luna and Blue were ever competing against one another in a Grammys category, I seriously don’t know how I’d be able to choose sides. \nDON’T MAKE ME CHOOSE, DIEGO AND BLUE. DON’T YOU DARE. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
