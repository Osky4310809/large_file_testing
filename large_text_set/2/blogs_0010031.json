With the Oscars just two weeks away, Hollywood’s finest flew over to London for the British Academy of Film and Television Awards on Sunday night. It was a big night for La La Land , which picked up the awards for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Original Music and Best Cinematography. But there were some special moments only viewers in Britain were privy to. Weren’t able to catch the show? Here were the six biggest moments from the BAFTA Awards: Photo: Getty Images 1. Royal Guests It wasn’t just Hollywood royalty in the audience at the Royal Albert Hall on Sunday night! Kate Middleton and Prince William were also in attendance . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were the last to arrive on the red carpet, waiting to make their entrance until most of the actors had gone inside. William later presented the Fellowship Award to Mel Brooks, saying, “BAFTA has sadly run out of actors, therefore, I’ve been roped in.” Ever the comedic genius, Brooks later apologized to the royals for the American Revolution, quipping, “We were young!” Photo: Getty Images 2. Dev Patel Wins Big! The Lion star was thrilled about his first major acting win and first BAFTA Award. He was almost speechless while going up to accept the award for Best Supporting Actor. “Wow, that just happened. Umm, words, words, words,” Patel stammered. “I once sat at home and watched this with my family, who are here with me tonight. It’s just such an overwhelming feeling.” After thanking the film’s cast and members of his team, Patel concluded by gushing, “I don’t know what to say except for I’m so grateful. I’m terrible at this!” 3. Things Get Political Keeping in tradition with the rest of this year’s awards shows, host Stephen Fry wasn’t afraid to throw in some thinly veiled political zingers during his opening monologue. He began by saying, “I look down on row after row of the most overrated people on the planet.” He then specifically pointed out Florence Foster Jenkins star Meryl Streep, declaring, “Perhaps one of the greatest actresses of all time, only a blithering idiot would think otherwise!” And before getting to this year’s winners, Fry got in one last jab, saying, “Let’s find out who the Russians have decided has won!” Photo: Getty Images 4. Cutest In-Laws Ever Former Devil Wears Prada co-stars Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt took the stage to present Best Adapted Screenplay. But it appeared that there were some underlying issues between Blunt and her sister Felicity Blunt’s hubby. “I can’t believe you slept with my wife!” Tucci declared. “Oh my god, for the last time, we shared a bedroom when we were children!” Blunt replied, grinning. Umm, can we please be invited to the next family event? Photo: Getty Images 5. Meryl Streep Kisses Host Stephen Fry She may not have taken home a BAFTA Award this year, but Streep did get her moment in the spotlight. When Fry declared that each year he selects one lucky lady for a smooch, the veteran actress quickly jumped up to give him a kiss. She quietly declared, “Thank you, I’m so thrilled!” “Never in the field of human conflict has my left cheek been so jealous of my right,” Fry insisted, before jokingly adding, “I’d say underrated to be honest.” Photo: ETONLINE 6. Casey Affleck Tells the Touching Story of Why He Acts The Manchester by the Sea star picked up the award for Best Actor at the British show. The soft-spoken Affleck was very appreciative for the honor and told a quick story about what led him to the profession in the first place. “The reason that I act is because when I was a young kid, my mom would take me to Al-Anon meetings and the kids there would reenact scenes from their childhood,” he recalled, saying it was his first time acting and embodying a character.
