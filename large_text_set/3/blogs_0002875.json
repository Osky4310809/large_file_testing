HughesNet Gen5 is pwoered by Hughes' Jupiter System, the \"world's most widely deployed satellite networking platform.\" \nNot only will the new service deliver faster speeds and more data, but it will offer built-in WiFi. \n\"HughesNet Gen5 will bring a new level of Internet services to the approximately 18 million households across the United States that are either unserved or suffering from slow wireline Internet services,\" said Pradman Kaul, President, Hughes Network Systems. \nFor residential customers, the HughesNet Gen5 service offers a range of plans with up to 50GB of data per month and pricing that starts as low as $49.99. Business plans range up to 250GB with starting prices starting at $69.99. All plans come with the same 25Mbps download and 3Mbps upload speeds. (That's all the pricing info Hughes would provide at this time, but it will be posting all of the Gen5 plans and pricing on March 16). \nAccording to the company, additional new features to the Gen5 service include: Built-in Wi-Fi to connect wireless devices No hard data limits -- if monthly plan data is exceeded, service continues at a reduced speed until the next billing cycle Video Data Saver to watch more videos using less data Bonus Zone -- 50 GB of free data per month to use during off-peak hours (2am-8am) \nIt's also worth mentioning that the new Jupiter Aero System will tap into the EchoStar XIX satellite, offering 400Mbps per aircraft, and certain airlines, such as Southwest, will provide the improved wireless Internet service on planes in the second half of 2017.
