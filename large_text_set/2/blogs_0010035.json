However, Dave Osborn, proprietor of Mahogany's, denied the request, which would have cost between $30,000 and $35,000. \"I thought about it, but I said no, I can't do that, because I have Thunder players that come in after games,\" Osborn told ESPN's Royce Young. \"Thunder players come in, fans come in, so I just said, 'I can't do that to them. It wouldn't be fair.'\" After passing on their request, Durant's reps called Osborn back to let him know that Thunder players would've been invited to join. \"I told them, 'I apologize, but I just can't do it,\" he said. \"I've got to stay true to the fans and the people that come in here because I do have a lot of people that come in after games.'\" Since Saturday's tension-filled contest between the Thunder and Warriors, Durant's mom Wanda spoke out about the way the OKC faithful treated her son throughout the game, especially the name-calling. With one more visit to his old stomping grounds coming up in March, we shouldn't expect to see or hear Thunder fans have a change of heart all of a sudden.
