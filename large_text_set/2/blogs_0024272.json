Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nNigel Farage was spotted dining with Donald Trump last night in the President's Washington DC Hotel. \nOnlookers said the ex-Ukip leader \"wasn't invited\" to the soiree, but was squeezed in \"last minute\". \nFarage was snapped enjoying a meal with the president, his daughter Ivanka , son-in-law Jared Kushner and Florida governor Rick Scott. \nMeanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was reportedly sitting on the other side of the restaurant, having dinner with his wife. \nThe group was spotted by journalist Benny Johnson, who said the Secret Service \"swarmed the place\" before Trump and co swanned in for a bite.

Squeezed in last second.\" \nEarlier in the evening, Farage's publicist tweeted that he was watching Aston Villa in the Hotel's bar. \nAfter dinner, Johnson approached Trump to ask whether he'd be attending the White House Correspondents' dinner. \nTrump replied: \"No. Do you like that?\" \nLast night, Trump tweeted to say he was chickening out of the annual 'nerd prom' - a gala dinner during which comedians frequently poke fun at the President. \nHe'll be the first president to avoid the roasting since Ronald Reagan in 1981, who didn't turn up because he was recovering an assassination attempt. \nTrump’s luxury DC hotel is in the city’s old post office building, which is still owned by the Federal Government. \nThe legitimacy of Trump’s lease on the property, which opened the month before November’s general election, have been called into question, after it emerged the terms prohibit office holders of being involved. \nThere have also been questions about whether foreign dignitaries staying at the hotel would constitute a breach of the US constitutions emoluments clause, which bans office holders gaining profits from overseas.
