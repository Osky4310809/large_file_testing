There was a lot going on under the surface. \nSareesh Sudhakaran, editor of Wolfcrow , has analyzed the motivation behind each shot, explaining why it serves the film's micro (scene-level) and macro (story-level) intent. Though Nolan employs fairly traditional coverage throughout the scene—60% medium shots, 30% wide shots, and 10% closeups—he still manages to say exactly what he wants to say with the camera. Here's how he does it: \nThe video, despite being titled \"pencil trick,\" has much more to say about cinematography and directing; at the end, however, Sudhakaran does briefly give us insight into how clever blocking was used to create the stunt: \"The stunt man swept away the pencil with his hand, which is out of frame, and Heath Ledger shielded his head.\" \nSudhakaran has always demonstrated a broad knowledge of the filmmaking process and this format really works to help filmmakers understand that every decision is important.
