According to a press release, he worked with one of the world's foremost roasters, Dr. G (Gerard Charles), and the two of them managed to roast a blend of Robusta coffee beans that is indulgently nutty, smooth and sweet.\nThe idea that Black Insomnia is the strongest coffee out there isn't just a matter of opinion (like your neighbor who claims his backyard BBQ chicken breast is the \"best in the world\")—it's actually backed up by facts. Lab tests confirmed that Black Insomnia—which has no added chemicals, preservatives, or sugars—has 17.5mg of caffeine per kg, making it 33% stronger than reigning world leader Deathwish Coffee (which has a wimpy 13.2mg of caffeine per kg). One 12-ounce cup has three times as much caffeine as a regular cup of Starbucks joe, which may be the answer to kicking our 3x daily grande latte habit to the curb.\nThere are currently nine other coffee brands on Amazon claiming to be the \"world's strongest,\" but Black Insomnia is calling BS. According to a press release from the brand, \"None have been able to reach the unadulterated caffeine content that defines Black Insomnia, nor should any brand attempt to surpass this content in the interest of public health and safety.\" That sounds mildly terrifying, but also has us dying for a cup.\nIf you're into waking up with tremors and not interested in sleeping ever again, the coffee is available on Amazon and BlackInsomnia.com in 16 ounce bags. Taste test, if you dare.\nCONTINUE READING", "external_links": ["https://blackinsomnia.coffee/", "https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&me=A2VVFO599JK2BV&page=1"], "published": "2017-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:08:00.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
