Screenshot: Sutanto Anwar Chen / 0 \nA lot of things can give people superpowers, like the bite of a radioactive spider, a magic hammer, a billion-dollar suit of armor... \nAnd, of course, being a parent. \nA horrible tragedy was averted in Jambi City in the island of Sumatra just before Christmas. As seen in this heart-stopping video, two small children are playing in a garage as their father, Zuki Chen Azm, is repairing a motorcycle nearby. Suddenly Zuki notices an out-of-control heading straight for his children... The car almost adds the two children to the list of people lost too-soon in 2016. But thanks to their father’s incredible cat-like reflexes, he is able to grab the two of them and does an unbelievable backflip to pull them out of harm’s way at the very last possible moment. The miraculous save took place on December 22 in Jambi City's Kebun Kopi neighborhood. The CCTV video footage of the incident was uploaded to Facebook by Sutanto Anwar Chen, a relative of Zuki and the owner of Selatan Jaya Motor, the garage where the incident took place. It has already been shared over 90,000 times on Facebook.\nResponding to comments on Facebook, Zuki said both of his children are totally fine now. He also said that the accident was caused due to the driver having an epileptic seizure. \nSutanto also shared these heartwarming photos of the heroic father with his kids.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T06:25:04.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
