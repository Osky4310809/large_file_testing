(Source: PTI Photo) \nThe crisis within the Samajwadi Party refused to die down as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was on Sunday crowned as the party chief, a position that has been held by his father Mulayam Singh Yadav for decades. At the party’s national executive Party meeting convened by general secretary Ramgopal Yadav today, party leaders unanimously elected Akhilesh to lead Samajwadi Party. The decision was termed as “unconstitutional” by Mulayam and has once again expelled Ramgopal for six years. Party vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda was also expelled from the party. \nSoon after being proposed as the national president of the party, Akhilesh said his respect for his father was more than ever and that he would stand against those conspiring against the party. “Those who conspired against the party, damaged it and also posed problems before the national president…should know that my respect for the national president (Mulayam Singh) will be more than before,” the chief minister said.

Stung by the developments, Mulayam issued a strongly-worded letter against his cousin brother Ramgopal. “The parliamentary board of the party declares all the proposals, decisions and the convention itself illegal and expels Ramgopal, who convened the convention, for six years,” he said in the letter. Akhilesh supporters also laid seize to the party headquarters in Lucknow and forcibly removed Shivpal’s nameplate outside his office.

The expulsion order was revoked within 24 hours and both were reinducted into SP. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T14:28:50.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
