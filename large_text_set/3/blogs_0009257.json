The device would also feature a virtual home button to quickly toggle Siri. \nThe design envisions using the virtual Siri button to scan and search for objects that the rear camera can see in real-time. This way, Siri can be used to quickly bring up information about landmarks and places, with the translucent design also helping navigation as the Maps app would be able to use the camera in real-time to display the path ahead. \nThe concept design is based on the various iPhone 8 rumors we have heard so far including a bezel-less display , virtual home button, and a function area at the bottom of the device with quick access to common settings. While the OLED iPhone 8 might be somewhat similar to the design of the iPhone shown in this concept, the AR functionality envisioned by the designer is still a few years away at best. \nWhat do you think about this concept iPhone 8 design? Will you be willing to pay upwards of $1,000 for an OLED iPhone if it looked something similar?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T18:05:03.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
