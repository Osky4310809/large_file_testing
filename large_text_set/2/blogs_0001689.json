Read on to find out more in this excerpt from his blog : \nAnd just like that, my time between jobs has evaporated. Seems like so long ago I was looking at the tail end of the year, noting that I’d left BCI and reveling in the time off. The prospect of visiting family, the holidays and the future. Now, today, I’m scanning the horizon; from a new location. Noting the differences, planning the course to follow, identifying ways to contribute. And what is it they say about location? Apparently it’s everything, right? It’s time to get back to work. \nMy new path will let me use everything I’ve learned in my career to help a known brand grow. I’ll be heading up evangelism, working on product, working with clients, helping plan events, writing and contributing to new-employee onboarding. In the background my SEO skills will randomly get workouts helping clients and building knowledge internally. The company is international, so there will be a bunch of travel. One of the things I have enjoyed most in my career is speaking at conferences. Being able to meet people first hand and solve problems with them. This new opportunity sees that being one of the focal points of my remit. I am grateful the company chose a title that should enable me to continue this work with influence: Vice President of Industry Insights. \nI am fortunate to know people at this company from my previous life. So it’ll be fun to grasp well-known hands firmly and work toward a big future goal together. The dynamic, the people and the opportunity within the space is, frankly, electric. They work with large and small clients and every person cares deeply about client success – because they know that it leads directly to our own success. No need to sugar coat this – we all know it’s true. Stand, deliver, repeat. \nThis company is known to many in our industry, but the plans they have are known to few. If you knew, you’d be as excited as I am! (And no, I’m not sharing.) Global scale, proven growth, realistic projections, an epic, proven leadership team whose depth extends several layer down from the top. I’ve met almost all of them and was already impressed by those I’ve previously known. The new-to-me-faces have enviable track records of success and bring proven skills to bear in their areas of responsibility. It’s going to be an exciting few years ahead, I can tell you that! \nWhile I’ll still be based in the LA-area, the company is headquartered elsewhere. Yup, I’ll be spending more time in one of my favorite cities. I’ll get to watch the seasons change there. I’ll need to find my winter gear again! New York, please be gentle with me! \nWhat’s next! \nYEXT! \nAccording to Wikipedia , “Yext is a New York City technology company that enables businesses to update location-related information on multiple websites from one place. The company was founded in 2006 by Howard Lerman, Brian Distelburger, and Brent Metz.” \nIn their press release on Duane’s appointment, Yext had the following to say: \n“Duane’s proven expertise, industry knowledge, and passion for search make him an invaluable addition to the Yext team,” said Jeffrey K. Rohrs, Chief Marketing Officer at Yext. “He will be a tremendous asset for our customers as they build their location data management strategies across an ever-evolving array of channels and devices.” Want to learn more from Duane? \nCome check out his session at SEJ Summit Chicago, happening May 11 at Navy Pier. You can also catch him on an exclusive #SEJLive with Kris Jones, discussing the next trends in search for 2017 today:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:42:36.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
