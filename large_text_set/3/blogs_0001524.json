FOX is currently working on a Marvel pilot . Because only one show about mutants is not enough. \nPerson of Interest ‘s Amy Acker has been cast as the lead in the pilot opposite True Blood ‘s Stephen Moyer. According to Deadline Hollywood , the new, still untitled show about mutants “focuses on two ordinary parents who discover their children possess mutant powers. Forced to go on the run from a hostile government, the family joins up with an underground network of mutants and must fight to survive.” Acker plays Kate, a mother struggling to deal with her separation from her husband Reed (Moyer), while struggling with her increasingly challenging teenagers. \nWritten by Matt Nix and directed by Bryan Singer, the teenagers are played by Emma Dumont as Lorna Dane/Polaris, the “strong-willed, brave and extremely loyal” daughter of Kate and Reed who has the ability to manipulate magnetism; and Percy Hynes, who plays Andy, a sensitive kid and a loner, he keeps to himself to avoid turmoil at school and at home. \nIt’s interesting that the description seems to suggest that both children have mutant powers, and yet only Lorna Dane has an alias and a specified power. I wonder if Andy’s will come into existence and into play if the series moves forward. \nIn any case, I’m always down for mutants…or inhumans…or metahumans…or whatever the kids are calling them these days. I’m also always down for Amy Acker who, in addition to her work on Person of Interest, was often the best part of any show she was on in the Whedonverse. \nWhat do you think?
