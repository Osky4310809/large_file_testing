In New York, London, and Paris the past few years have brought a significant uptick in inclusive casting. Though change has come to Milan Fashion Week , it has happened at a much slower rate, the end of season tallies regarding runway diversity frequently place the city at or near the bottom of the list. And during the menswear collections the lack of variety can be even more pronounced, with many high-profile designers still relying on mostly white casts. \nThat said, there are signs that the mindset is evolving. Miuccia Prada opened her Fall 2017 show over the weekend with Kaissan Ibrahima, a talented skateboarder turned model who is one of the few people of color to have landed the coveted top spot at Prada. Casting director Ashley Brokaw filled the runway with an eclectic lineup of young men and women who embodied a modern ethos. Swedish and Cape Verdean newcomer Joaquim Arnell, Senegalese-German model Alpha Dia, and Korea’s Next Top Model alum Jeong Yong Soo all featured prominently, as did longtime Prada favorites, including Clement Chabernaud and Rogier Bosschaart. The blend of new faces and established stars made for a compelling group, one that represented Prada’s international reach. \nAt Versace , Donatella and co. underscored the collection’s themes of fearlessness and hope by making the cast diverse. Opened and closed by Nigerian Elite Model Look winner, Davidson Obennebo, the collection featured plenty of the chiseled bodies typically associated with Versace and an array of men from all over the world. Selected by casting director Piergiorgio Del Moro, the men of Versace were, of course, sexy but they weren’t your average hunks. These days it’s all about the total package; Zhengyang Zhang’s elegant androgyny or Lucas Cristino’s boy-next-door charm offer something different than Jordan Barrett’s Aussie smolder, but it takes all three to create something resonant. \nPrada and Versace weren’t the only big brands to enliven Milan with memorable model moments; Dolce & Gabbana ’s social media–driven influencer casting showcased the power of the international youthquake, while Moschino ’s resistance-inspired collection offered runway protest via faces who mostly represented the full spectrum of American beauty. At Alessandro Sartori’s debut at Ermenegildo Zegna , the diverse model selection by Andrew Weir involved a range of ages and races, showcasing the universality of Ermenegildo Zegna’s tailored aesthetic. No matter the reason, the shift toward inclusiveness has been powerful. There is still plenty of work to be done, but with each show we move closer to seeing the runways that reflect our reality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:00:22.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
