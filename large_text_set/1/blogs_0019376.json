About a week ago, Graham Wheeler, product and service director at HTC EMEA, announced on Twitter that European HTC 10 devices would be getting Android Nougat within the next two weeks . We are now happy to report that the Nougat update has begun rolling out in Europe.\nToday, Wheeler again took to Twitter to announce that Android Nougat is making its way to HTC 10 devices in the UK. He also added that the update will be available in other countries soon. Although an exact time frame wasn’t specified, we expect that it will be released within the next couple of days.\n\nHTC is also rolling out Nougat to the One M9 in the UK, with several owners sharing screenshots of the install screen on Twitter. This is consistent with previous statements made by HTC, saying that the One M9 would get bumped up to the latest version of Android in the same timeframe as the HTC 10. The update should be available in other countries soon.\nThe next device HTC plans on updating to Nougat in Europe is the One A9 . Although the company said that the update will be available at an unspecified later date, we have heard that the device has already been bumped up to the latest version of Android in some countries that are part of the MEA region (Middle East and Africa). This is good news, as it likely means that the update for the European One A9 is just around the corner.\nSee also: HTC U Ultra: The top features you should know 2 weeks ago It’s great to see that the Nougat update for the HTC 10 and One M9 is finally being released in Europe, as it has already been available in the US for some time. Across the pond, HTC updated both the 10 as well as the One M9 to Nougat back in December.\nHave you got the update yet?
