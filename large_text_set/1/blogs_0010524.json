Costa's agent Jorge Mendes met with chairman of Tianjin Quanjian today...more to come soon #Cfc — Simon Johnson (@sjstandardsport) January 13, 2017 While no one’s disputing that superagent Jorge Mendes met with the chairman of a Chinese club earlier on Friday — there is picture proof, after all — this meeting was used to sell James Rodriguez stories just 10 hours prior to the Diego Costa BLAZING ROW eruption. A photo posted by Goal (@goalglobal) on Jan 13, 2017 at 12:57am PST That doesn’t mean either one of is true or false; Jorge Mendes represents a ton of big stars and he’s been the agent perhaps most instrumental in getting a lot of big stars a lot of big paychecks in China. He is truly a master of his agenting craft. But rumors are rumors and these ones certainly sound juicy. When is there not a big offer from China? Oh and is Jorge Mendes his agent? Fancy that https://t.co/PbOtdCvo59 — tariq panja (@tariqpanja) January 13, 2017 According to Simon Johnson’s report , Tianjin Quanjian (not to be confused with Mikel’s new club, Tianjin TEDA) are willing to offer north of £80m for Costa and give him over half a million, £570k to be exact, per week. PER. WEEK. This is the same club who just signed Axel Witsel from Zenit and are currently managed by Italy legend Fabio Cannavaro. He's being offered £576,000 per WEEK by Chinese Superleague club. — Jim White (@JimWhite) January 13, 2017 Costa, who’s missed the last few days of training apparently (two or three, depending on who and what you believe), is far from under-compensated at Chelsea, but these guys are offering him four times what he’s making here, possibly more if we account for taxes. Sporting ambitions are great and all that, but that amount of money is no laughing matter. Perhaps not coincidentally, there are renewed rumblings of Romelu Lukaku still dreaming of Chelsea ( here’s Kristof Terreur talking about that on a podcast ). That said, with all reports insisting that Chelsea aren’t willing to sell, there’s a good chance all this will blow over in a few days or weeks. Conte and Costa will hug it out, his back will get patched up, and we’ll go back to winning games and scoring goals and maintaining our lead at the top of the table. Any other outcome at this point is just too head-shakingly disappointing to think about. Chelsea and Abramovich are adamant they will not be bullied by Chinese money and they blame entire Costa bust up on the offer he's had #cfc — Matt Law (@Matt_Law_DT) January 13, 2017  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:45:54.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
