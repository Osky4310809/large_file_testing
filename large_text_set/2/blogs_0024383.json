That may not seem likely to happen, but publishers might be inclined to do so because, with the tax hidden in the purchase price, any sudden, sharp increase in cost will be laid at their feet. \nSteam users who live in other jurisdictions may eventually face the added taxes as well: As reported by PCGamesN , Valve said in the email that \"we expect to add other individual countries over the course of 2017-2018, depending on applicable law.\" \nAs to why Valve is making these changes now, it may be tangentially related to the European Commission's investigation into \"suspected anti-competitive practices.\" That investigation, which also includes Bandai Namco, Capcom, Focus Home, Koch Media, and ZeniMax, is focused on whether the use of region-locked activation keys violates EU rules on \"parallel trade,\" but it may also have convinced Valve to make doubly sure that it's in full compliance with rules across the board. \nI've emailed Valve for more information about the changes,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:24:20.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
