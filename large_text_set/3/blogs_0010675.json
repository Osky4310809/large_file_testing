Minnesota has won six of its last nine contests to pull within 3.5 games of a playoff spot. \nTowns opened the week with a 29-point, 14-rebound performance in a win vs. the Los Angeles Clippers. He went 14-of-18 from the field and recorded his 100th career double-double. Towns (21y113d) became the second-youngest player in NBA history to reach the 100 double-double mark (Dwight Howard, 20y351d). \nTwo days later, Towns tallied 23 points and grabbed nine rebounds to help the Wolves defeat the Golden State Warriors, who entered the game with the NBA’s best record. He finished the week with 35 points, 14 rebounds and two blocks in a loss at Milwaukee. It was Towns’ 13th 30+ point effort of the season and he was 14-for-21 from the field in that game. \nTowns has scored 20+ points in 20 straight games, the longest streak in club history and the longest current streak in the NBA.
