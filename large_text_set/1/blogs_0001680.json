This week, a bright meteor shower, a newly-discovered comet and the Aurora Borealis are set to put on their own show to kick off 2017! The Quadrantid meteor shower \nThe night of January 3-4 marks the peak of the first meteor shower of the year - the Quadrantids . \nFrom December 28 to January 12, Earth passes through a stream of debris in space. This is typical of meteor showers, as the passage of comets through the inner solar system leaves behind a trail of dust, ice and rock, and these meteoroids produce bright streaks of light in our night sky as they are swept up by the atmosphere. The Quadrantids are a bit different than other meteor showers, however. Rather than just one parent body, the Quadrantids have two! \nFor many years, astronomers, meteor experts and enthusiasts alike all watched the January Quadrantids, as they were first recorded in the year 1825. It wasn't until much more recently that the source of the meteor shower was discovered, though. Comet 96P/Machholz 1 was discovered by amateur astronomer Donald Machholz in 1986, and its orbit closely matched that of the Quadrantid meteoroids, however 17 years later, astronomers discovered asteroid (196256) 2003 EH1, which also closely matched the Quadrantid meteoroid orbits. It has been suggested lately that all three of these - the comet, the asteroid and the meteor shower - are related. Given that (196256) 2003 EH1 has been labeled as an \"extinct comet\", it's quite possible that it and comet 96P/Machholz 1 were both once part of a larger cometary body that broke apart at some point in the past. \nRegardless of their origin, the Quadrantids are always exceptional, due to being a very strong and bright shower - typically delivering around 120 meteors per hour during its peak, on the night of Jan 3-4. The shower's peak is a very sharp one, however, lasting only an hour or two, and the best time to watch is likely in the hours just before sunrise, local time. \nThe location of the Quadrantid radiant, after midnight, on the night of January 3-4, 2017.

Sutherland \nAlthough the Quadrantid radiant is in the vicinity of the constellation Bootes, if you want to find it, look in the northeast sky, after midnight, just under the Big Dipper. \nYou don't need to find the radiant to enjoy the show, however. The best way to watch this meteor shower, as with others, is to find a dark place, away from city lights, plunk down a lawn chair, sit and tilt your head back, so that you can take in the entire night sky, all at once. This is because the meteoroids in the debris stream can intercept the atmosphere at any point in the sky, so only keeping your eyes on the northeast will mean missing plenty of these meteors. \nUnlike the Geminids, which had to compete with the light of the December 14 Full Moon, the Quadrantids rise only after the January 3 waxing crescent Moon has set for the night. So, there should be great viewing, if the weather gives us clear skies. \nRELATED: Got your hands on a space rock? Here's how to know for sure! Comet NEOWISE \nThroughout the week, we have a chance to catch a glimpse of a comet that's fairly new to us. \nDiscovered on October 21, 2016 by NASA's infrared space telescope NEOWISE, this comet - now called C/2016 U1 (NEOWISE) - is on its approach to the Sun. It already passed its closest point to Earth, back on December 13, at a very safe distance of round 275 times farther away than the Moon, but it's this week, as the comet approaches its January 14 perihelion, that it will likely be bright enough that we can see it here, from Earth's surface. \nThis oblique view of the comet's hyperbolic orbit (in pink) shows its path through the inner solar system and beyond.

As of now, projections have it remaining below 6th magnitude brightness - the threshold for naked-eye visibility. However, comets are unpredictable, and there is always the chance that one may brighten unexpectedly. \nKeep an eye out in the eastern sky this week, early in the morning, just before sunrise. \nThe position of comet C/2016 U1 (NEOWISE) at 6:30 a.m. local time, on January 6.

Sutherland \nGiven this comet's trajectory through the inner solar system, it is very likely on an orbit that takes thousands to millions of years to resolve, so now would be a good time to try to see it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:14:13.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
