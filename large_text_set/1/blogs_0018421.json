The New York Post reported that, though Jarrett’s beat is new, she was actually quietly hired by the network in September. \nWith no experience in journalism, her qualification for the post is apparently the fact that she is a Harvard-educated lawyer who, according to her CNN bio , has defended “companies and individuals in government investigations brought by the Justice Department.” \nDespite her lack of journalism experience, some might find Jarrett’s close ties to Obama (who attended her wedding) and the Democratic Party through her mother to be somewhat off-putting, even if they don’t impede on her ability to report on Trump’s administration objectively. \nValerie Jarrett didn’t take it so well when Trump won the presidency. In fact, she took it like “a punch in the stomach.” \nTalk about fair and balanced. \nLol. \nCNN’s plans to completely phase themselves out regarding journalistic integrity is nearly complete.
