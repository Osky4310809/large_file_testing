Francois Hollande: Two-state solution is the only way \nMissing from these initiatives is a concrete idea of who the Palestinians are even represented by. \nWestern countries have obviously favoured the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority (PA), led by Mahmoud Abbas - a president whose term ended eight years ago - and unelected bureaucrats. \nBut the PA cannot even claim to be representing those Palestinians only living in the occupied territories, since it does not even maintain control of the Gaza Strip, where nearly two million of them live. \nThe PA also faces widespread criticism in the Israeli-occupied West Bank where its security forces cooperate with the Israeli military. \nOther Palestinian groups, including Hamas, remain noticeably absent from these meetings. \nPalestinians living in the diaspora, including the millions who have only known life in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and elsewhere, are conspicuously absent from the discussion, despite the Palestinian call for the refugees' \"Right to Return\" home to Israel-Palestine being a fundamental question to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian impasse. \nPalestinians living inside Israel under what many human rights observers consider to be clear discriminatory laws , meanwhile, are left out of the conversation entirely, which requires a questioning of why the conflict is being framed without their voices. \nThese facts are not particularly eye opening to Palestinians and those observers who have been following this issue closely for the past few years. \nBut this reality appears to fade when one enters the diplomatic arena. \nThough Israel denounced this latest French initiative, to be sure it has only benefited politically and economically from the 20-year-long peace process known as the Oslo Accords - a fact that has been well covered. \nIsrael's resistance to the French conference can surely be explained by the fact that its current government has all but outright rejected the notion of a Palestinian state and - in keeping in line with previous governments - resisted any efforts to involve the wider international community. \nIt is for these same reasons that Israel has been so combative with regards to recent UN efforts - though merely symbolic - to recognise a Palestinian state and call for Israel to abide by international law and halt its settlement construction.
