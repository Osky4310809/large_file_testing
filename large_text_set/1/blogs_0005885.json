He will lead a team from the Covington & Burling law firm, where he’s been working since leaving the Obama administration in 2015. \n“With the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead,” California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement. “This is a critical moment in the history of our nation. We have an obligation to defend the people who elected us and the policies and diversity that make California an example of what truly makes our nation great.” \nThey said Holder and his team will advise “in our efforts to resist any attempts to roll back the progress California has made.” \nThe statement did not specify which policies they anticipate will cause friction, though California’s numerous sanctuary cities are likely to face challenges from an administration that has threatened to pull their federal funding. \nHolder was behind Fast and Furious; a disastrous operation carried out by the Justice Dept. \nHe was constantly dividing the nation on race. \nHe failed to conduct a legitimate investigation into the IRS scandal where conservative groups were targeted. \nAlso, Holder refused to guide Obama on matters constitutional and unconstitutional. \nSlow hand clap, Cali.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:26:13.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
