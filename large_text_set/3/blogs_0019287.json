The new E-Berlingo extends Citroën's electric vehicle range consisting of the C-ZERO, E-MEHARI and Berlingo LCV, each one responding to specific needs in its respective segment. 2017 Citroen E-Berlingo Multispace \nElectric with no compromises on spaciousness and liveability \nThe new model's expressive design and robust feel underscore body styling suggestive of a capacious cabin. The lithium-ion batteries were fitted in the subframe on either side of the rear axle, so the new Citroën E-Berlingo keeps all of its cabin and boot volume. The E-Berlingo remains more practical than ever for daily trips, drives with the family, friends and colleagues, and experiencing leisure and professional activities to the full. Occupants enjoy outstanding practicality and liveability, making the car particularly appealing. Meeting the needs of \"nomads\" with a diverse range of modern lifestyles, the Citroën E-Berlingo is eminently adaptable and boasts standard-setting modular design. It can transport up to five people and swallow up the largest loads with its flat floor. The seats in row 2, comprising a bench and a side seat or three independent seats, are removable. To adapt to all motoring uses, one or more seats can be removed to make room for voluminous loads. The boot volume is among the best in the category, at 675 litres with five people on board and 3,000 litres with the row 2 seats removed. The comfortable and user-friendly cabin has a total 78 litres of open and closed storage spaces. Access to the vehicle couldn't be simpler with two sliding side doors plus a rear tailgate.

The new model combines the practicality of the Berlingo with all the benefits of an electric drivetrain, including eco-responsible and pleasant driving, controlled costs, the possibility of city access regardless of traffic restrictions, and tax and parking advantages. The new E-Berlingo Multispace is equipped with the electrc drivetrain technology presented in 2013 on the electric Berlingo light commercial vehicle that has demonstrated its qualities in numerous professional fleets. RANGE: with certified range of 170 km (NEDC norm), the E-Berlingo Multispace is perfectly adapted to consumer uses, with the large majority of Europeans driving under 100 km a day. It is fully in step with its times and brings customers an all-new mobility experience with complete peace of mind. DRIVING PLEASURE : the Citroën E-Berlingo Multispace has a range of charging modes to make motoring easier for customers. An empty battery can be charged completely via a regular domestic socket (8A to 10A depending on the country) or a secure Green Up socket (14A) in 8.5, 12 or 15 hours depending on the amperage. E-Berlingo is also available with an optional rapid charging mode, charging the battery to 50% of total range in 15 minutes and 80% in 30 minutes. The regular charging flap is located on the rear right wing of the car, while the rapid charge socket takes the place of the fuel flap on the rear left wing. EASY USE: the new Citroën E-Berlingo Multispace is powered by a compact and high-performance permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor developing 49 kW (67 bhp). The two high-energy density Lithium-Ion battery packs with a capacity of 22.5 kWh are located in the subframe, lowering the car's centre of gravity and bringing more dynamic stability to this type of body style. With torque of 200 Nm available from the word go, the E-Berlingo Multispace accelerates swiftly and uninterruptedly up to top speed. This performance is enhanced by the use of a full-time single-speed reduction gear, freeing drivers up from gear changing and providing the same ease of use as an automatic gearbox. The car accelerates with no noise or vibrations, for extra travelling comfort. ECONOMY IN USE: the new Citroën E-Berlingo Multispace has lower energy costs than a fossil-fuel option and is more economical than an internal-combustion vehicle. The battery comes with an 8-year/100,000-km warranty and the electric drivetrain with a 5-year/50,000-km warranty, whichever comes first. Servicing is every two years or 40,000 km after the first year. The car requires no oil, belt or coolant. The absence of a gearbox and clutch limits the number of components to be monitored, and thanks to the dual energy recovery system on decelerating and braking, the brakes are used less often, which limits wear. \nModern technologies for a more serene electric experience \nFor an even more comfortable experience, the new E-Berlingo Multispace comes with remote-controlled functions via smartphones : The Citroën E-Berlingo Multispace will be equipped with a thermal preconditioning system, an ingenious innovation that customers can use to heat or cool the interior of their vehicle remotely via their smartphone or tablet. This new function brings drivers and passengers optimal thermal comfort right from the start of the journey. The E-Berlingo Multispace provides an innovative eco-driving experience. The highly visible energy consumption and regeneration indicator helps drivers at all times to adopt an economical driving style and optimise range. Drivers are also informed by an auxiliary consumption gage (for the heating and air conditioning), while an onboard computer displays remaining range and average consumption in kWh/100 km. The clear and reliable low-energy alerts make for an utterly serene experience for drivers. Drivers can also check battery charge levels remotely. \nA modern leisure activity vehicle \nThe new E-Berlingo Multispace features an extensive range of useful and effective equipment for more safety, an easier drive and simplified day-to-day use.
