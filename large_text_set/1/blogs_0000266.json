This is never mentioned in the books. Is it canon according to our guide? Yes, since there is no evidence from the books to say that it didn't happen. The Harry Potter games contain a spell known as Avifors to change statues into birds. Is this canon according to our guide? Yes, since there is no evidence to suggest that such a spell doesn't exist. This can generally be applied to most spells/items from the games. In the Goblet of Fire film, Krum attacks Fleur in the Maze during the Triwizard Tournament. Is this considered canon? No, because the book, a higher source of canon, specifically states that Crouch/Moody did it. However, it should be noted in the \"Behind the scenes\" section. Mafalda is a cut character from an early draft of Goblet of Fire . Is she canon according to our guide? Yes and no. The fact that she exists may be considered canon, but anything about her intended part in the story cannot be considered canon because it did not happen in the books. In the games, are the various challenges/levels considered canon according to our guide? Yes and no. Levels like the Glacius Challenge from the Prisoner of Azkaban game should not be considered canon since it is highly unlikely that the students would be put in danger like that. However, challenges like helping to assemble Dumbledore's Army for their first meeting in Order of the Phoenix could conceivably be considered canon because they usually involve helping out with a task to free the student up to attend. Notes ↑ Differences between editions of the books ↑ Rowling has auctioned a few copies of her books with added material ↑ https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/source_cards.html ↑ 5.0 5.1 Including the detailed information no longer found on the current version of the website ↑ On numerous occasions, Rowling has provided information not included in the books or films, that has been used to expand upon character backstory. In particular the documentary J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life includes a segment in which she provides names and character outcomes not covered elsewhere. ↑ For example, J.K. Rowling created/approved/was involved in the creation of some original content for non tier-one canon's sources such as the Wonderbook: Book of Spells , the Wonderbook: Book of Potions , the Harry Potter video games , the film series , the Wizarding World of Harry Potter , etc. if it ever happened that one specific element can be proved to have been originated directly from J.K. Rowling herself (or at least that she considers it canon) then this one element can be added to the tier-one. Unpublished/unused material Rowling created (such as early drafts, cut content , the script of deleted scenes from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film) , changes editors forced her to do, or ghost plots ) has a specific status (see Examples of usage n°4).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T04:54:52.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
