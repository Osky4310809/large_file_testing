On The Bachelor ’s Monday, February 27, episode, Nick Viall cleared the air with Andi Dorfman before saying goodbye to this season’s most talked-about woman. He also received an “I love you” that could be among the most romantic in franchise history. \nAndi Returns, and Nick Apologizes \nIt’s been over two years since Nick asked Andi why she made love to him if she wasn’t in love with him, but he had never fully apologized for the tough question. Well, Andi finally got that satisfaction after she surprised Nick at his hotel room to catch up with him ahead of the rose ceremony. Since the moment was too good to miss, read Us Weekly ’s full play-by-play of their conversation here .

As soon as Nick gave the final rose to Vanessa , Corinne looked down and burst into tears, which is one of the most vulnerable moments we've seen from her. Raven offered her a shoulder to cry on before Nick led her toward the exit. \nHalfway to her getaway limo, Corinne pulled Nick toward her. “I’m sorry if I ever did anything to make you upset,” she said between sobs. Nick assured her she had “nothing to regret, nothing to second-guess,” and he seemed to genuinely mean that, but continued leading her to her car nonetheless.

I have so much love for you, Corinne.” She wished him luck, got into her limo and turned away from him. \nAfter her tears subsided, Corinne vowed, “I am done trying to impress these men. I’m going to be me. And whatever happens, happens, but I will never kiss up to a man ever again in my life.” And then she fell asleep, wine glass in hand. Nick Viall Mitch Haaseth/ABC \nRaven Opens Up \nNick took his final three women to Finland, where there were only a few hours of sunlight every day, perfect for extending the \"overnight\" part of the overnight dates. Raven had the first date of the week, and she jumped into Nick’s arms before they both jumped into a helicopter for a ride over a snowy national park. Raven fell more in love with Nick on their date at a pub, playing darts and realizing how perfect they would be for each other: He would cook, she would fold laundry and they would forever argue over ironing versus steaming.
