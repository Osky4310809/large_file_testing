Could   \nThe drinks are flowing, the nibbles are circulating, the guests are mingling and Lionel Richie is Dancing on the Ceiling. \nI’m sipping a pink cocktail adorned with an umbrella and cherry and chatting with Eileen who’s wearing a bo-ho floral headband with Glastonbury chic. \nAs I scan the room for a seat, a twinkly-eyed charmer called John asks if I’d like to sit on his knee. \nBut before I can reply someone calls “Who wants a top-up?” and my fellow revellers cheer and hold up their glasses. \nThis party is swinging! \nEven the budgie in the corner is dancing on his perch. Yes, the budgie. \nThis vibrant nightspot also has a few walking frames and far comfier chairs than your average club. \nBecause I’m partying in the lounge of a care home with residents in their 70s and 80s who nearly all have some form of dementia.

It’s a brilliant, easy way to volunteer because it just feels like an evening out with friends. \n“You turn up once a month, have a drink, a chat, and maybe a dance and you can see you’re making people happy. What’s not to love about a party?” \nJohn, 81, agrees. “You can’t beat a bit of a knees-up and a tipple, can you?” he laughs. “It bucks you up. Cheers!” \nA recent report warned we are heading for “age apartheid” in which young and old lead segregated lives. \nThink-tank United For All Ages said many older folk are “isolated and institutionalised” meaning young people miss out on their experience and wisdom. Eileen with another resident John (Photo: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror) Eileen with the Mirror's Rachael (Photo: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror) \nA separate Age UK study revealed a “hidden epidemic of loneliness” is put­­ting huge strain on our care system. \nArts charity Magic Me saw this all too clearly as their volunteers worked on inter-generational care home projects. \nResidents reported that even ings were the loneliest part of the day – with fewer visitors or activities – and Cocktails in Care Homes was born. \nBacked by individual, cor­­porate and trust fund don­­ations, 250 vol­­unteers now run monthly parties in nine London care homes and hope to expand across the country. \nEach bash has a theme – Roaring Twenties, Hollywood Glamour, Costa del Cocktail or Winter Wonderland. Two party managers liaise with staff and provide drinks, food and decorations. \nOther volunteers, all trained to communicate with those with dementia , are there to socialise. \nMagic Me manager Sarah Dean says: “Care homes can be stressful places for families, especially if a relative has dementia. \n\"A party provides a relaxed way to spend time together. Staff tell us the atmosphere in homes is brighter and lighter for days after. Eileen chats to the Mirror's Rachael (Photo: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror) \n“At one party a lady came in to join her husband who has dementia. They danced together all night, just as they used to. \n“Another resident told a volunteer ‘I haven’t worn lipstick since I came here – it’s amazing how a little thing like that makes you feel better’.” \nThe organisers make a point of checking residents’ favourite tunes as music can help trigger memories. \nSarah adds: “People think that means Vera Lynn or Frank Sinatra but for many it’s 60s pop or reggae. \n“One lady with early-onset dementia loves heavy metal.” \nI join a Valentine-themed party at George Mason Lodge in Leytonstone, East London. There are bright decorations everywhere and heart-shaped chocs and biccies. \nMaria is mixing gin, orange and pomegranate cocktails and the bar beside her is groaning with bottles of rum, whisky, Pimms, beer and wine. \nResidents who can’t have alcohol because of medication wear a red dot on their name tags – and staff make sure no one gets too tipsy.

It’s always buzzing. You can see – and hear – how much they enjoy it.” \nWaltham Forest councillor Angie Bean says: “Residents, volunteers and staff enjoy these activities. \n“They bring people together and can also help bring back wonderful memories.” \nVolunteer Claire, 43, who works for an asset management company, says: “You’ll be talking to somebody, a memory suddenly triggers and they tell you the most wonderful stories. You know, in that mom­­ent, they are really enjoying themselves.” \nI chat to David, 73, who wears a natty trilby and is talking to John. They tell me about a seaside mural college students painted at the home. \n“It’s got beaches, lots of ships, a shark and a donkey,” says David. “It’s like Hawaii Five-O,” chips in John, “not the donkey though!” \nWe look through a “memory box” full of objects that can spark recollections through the fog of dementia. \nThere’s a picture of a plane flying over mountains. David looks closer and says: “That’s Pan-Am so they must be the Rockies. Joan gets into the party spirit (Photo: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror) \n“I once built a dairy in a town near Van couver on top of the Rock­­ies. I loved it there and Mrs Davidson, the farmer’s wife, made the most delicious honey cake.” \nJohn shows me a sunny seaside shot. “That can’t be up North if the sun’s out!” he laughs. \nWe’re joined by volunteer Charlie Smoothy, 25, who works for an industry regulator. \n“I miss my gran in Derbyshire,” she says, “but I really just enjoy spending time with the older generation. You hear incredible stories and gain a perspective on your own life. \n“I always leave with a lesson learnt. One lady was telling me she flew planes in the war and another was explaining how she used to make the best Yorkshire puddings in town.” \nKaty Hickey, 26, who works for charity Scope, is playing Connect 4 with resident Marion, 84, who’s just thrashed her three games running. \n“I work with kids and young adults so I wanted to get involved with the older generation,” she says. “I like to think others might do the same for my grandparents should they ever need it.” \nSarah Dean says: “Older people like things that are active, stimulating and creative. They love the energy they get off the younger people. It’s great for breaking down the barriers that each generations has towards each other. \n“We’re often told ‘When the young people come, we come to life’.” To volunteer or make a donation go to: cocktails.magicme.co.uk Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:07:43.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
