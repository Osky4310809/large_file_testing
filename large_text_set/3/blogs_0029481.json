Lobbyists for big telecom companies want these rules abolished, but Sonic disagrees, and we urge the House of Representatives to reconsider this attack on Americans’ privacy.\nConsumers deserve their privacy when they use the Internet. Internet access is an essential part our lives today. The vibrant and dynamic ecosystem of amazing applications, tools, people and content has driven the growth of the internet, which in turn has transformed every aspect of society — from business, government and education to our privates lives. And it’s precisely the openness of the internet that has fueled this prosperity; its integrity is now being put into question.\nFor carriers to advocate for the ability to monitor your use of the internet is, frankly, just as creepy.\nWhen carriers threaten to monitor their subscriber’s use of the internet, it puts a trusted relationship with the public at risk. If your telephone company was advocating for the right to automatically monitor your audio telephone calls and sell what they hear, would this make you comfortable about using your phone? Of course not; it is a ridiculous concept. For carriers to advocate for the ability to monitor your use of the internet is, frankly, just as creepy.\nThe way people use the internet and the things they use it for is intimate and private — and it should remain that way. Whether it’s shopping, dating, seeking a job, emailing your lawyer or browsing a support forum, what you do on the internet is your own private business and should not be sold for profit by large corporations.\nOur country’s founders recognized the importance of privacy, codifying in the fourth amendment the “...right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects…” While this is in regards to government access, the point is the same for personal privacy — should an oligopoly carrier that you have no choice but to use have the right to follow your every virtual step?\nAnd while we’re on the subject, we should be talking about another related concern: the oligopoly that hinders competition. Most American consumers have only one or two carriers to choose from that can deliver reasonable speed internet access.\nIt’s precisely this oligopoly that’s the real culprit — everything else including net neutrality is a mere symptom.\nIf consumers had more competitors to choose from, I believe the free market would achieve the outcome of both privacy protections and network neutrality. Carriers who sold your usage information or compromised access to some content would find that consumers moved to another service, and their business interests would result in better practices. It’s precisely this oligopoly that’s the real culprit — everything else including net neutrality is a mere symptom.\nBut Sonic, Ting, Google Fiber and a few others aside, Americans do not have enough competitive choice. Until that happens, regulation of privacy and neutrality in the internet ecosystem is critical.\nThis is critical moment for the history of the internet. It’s more important than ever for people to stand up for their rights to privacy because — and make no mistake — it affects everyone . The House has a chance to uphold this right - we hope they’ll make the right decision.\nWATCH: This ambitious U-shaped skyscraper could soon loop over NYC", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/B7l87KlQ.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/B7l87KlQ.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-27T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T15:44:13.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
