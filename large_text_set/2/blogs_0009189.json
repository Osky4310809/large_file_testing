By Tom Phillips Published 13/02/2017 \nGrand Theft Auto 5 is back at the top of the UK charts, more than three years after its original launch. \nRockstar's open-world success has been hovering around the top spot again since Christmas, although it has rarely dropped outside the top 10 since it first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 back in 2013. \nThis week marks the 12th week GTA5 has sold more than any other game in the UK. For a game now several years old - even its PS4 and Xbox One re-release - it's a noteworthy feat. \nJust three games have recorded more time at the top of the UK charts - Zumba Fitness (13 weeks), Wii Fit (16) and Who Wants to be a Millionaire (a record 18 weeks). FIFA 14 equalled GTA5's dozen total. \nLast week's new release Nioh settled for second place. I guess you could say it was a Nioh miss of the top spot - eh? \nResident Evil 7 continued selling steadily in third place, ahead of FIFA 17, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, Battlefield 1, Rocket League and the disc-based release of Hitman. \nHere's the full top 10, list fans: GTA5", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:16:32.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
