And he doesn’t appear to have done very well, as the children don’t seem to have understood the devastating news. That leaves Dot even more worried about Jack’s future. \nOn Friday, just weeks after his wedding day, Jack will bury his wife and sister-in-law. He asks Phil to speak at the funeral – but surprisingly he refuses. \nAn already upset Sharon tells Phil the truth about Denise’s baby, then demands to know why he won’t do his bit for his cousins. How will she react to his response? Interview The family gather for the funeral (Photo: BBC) \nWe asked Scott Maslen, who plays Jack, what the future holds for the young widower \nHow is Jack? \nHe’s devastated. His whole world has fallen apart and he is struggling to hold everything together. Losing Ronnie has ripped his heart out. \nHow will he face the funeral? \nJack is really struggling. He is desperate to protect the children but they are finding it very difficult to come to terms with the fact that Ronnie and Roxy are no longer there. It’s going to be extremely tough for him. \nIs Jack still planning to move away? \nYes. He is burying his head in the sand and wants to get as far away from it all as possible. \nHow is he getting on with Ronnie and Roxy’s mum Glenda? \nAt first things were extremely fraught but since then they have been trying to support each other. However, just when Jack thinks he can rely on Glenda she throws a spanner in the works. \nIs Jack pleased that his brother Max is back? \nYes. I don’t think Jack could have got through these past few weeks without him. Just having Max there to help with the children has made a big difference. At her Whit's end Lee tells Whitney that he has a job interview and that he intends to pay Mick back (Photo: WARNING: Use of this copyright image is subject to the terms of use of BBC Pictures' Digital Picture Service (BBC Pictures) as set out at www.bbcpictures.co.uk.

He also tells her he has a job interview that day and, if it goes well, it could turn their fortunes around. But later, in The Vic, he gets drunk and takes out his anger at his troubles on Whit, blaming her for everything that’s happened. \nIt seems that their marriage is broken. Is it beyond repair?
