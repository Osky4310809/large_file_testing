The DVD delivery service has sort of fallen by the wayside as Netflix continues to grow its instant services, but they’ve now added a new app just for DVD service customers and we’re feeling a l ttle nostalgic. Not even just Netflix, but thinking back on the good ol’ days of DVD and VHS rental services makes us feel all warm and fuzzy.\nWas there anything better than walking into a Blockbuster , or knowing the next season of your fav show was waiting at home in your mailbox after school? Well, now you can translate that feeling on the new app, if you still subscribe to Netflix’s DVD subscription service. The new app will let users keep up with their queues on the go, so if your mom tells you about a new show you have to watch, you can add it right there — sorry, you no longer have an excuse to avoid it. There’ll also be, obvi , notifications when Netflix returns and ships your next movie or show, which will def make every day feel like Christmas in the mail. Because who DOESN’T like getting MAIL? Actual, tangible, MAIL??\nUnfortunately, the app is only available for iOS users as of now, but WHO KNOWS what 2017 will bring, other than soooo many DVDs straight to our mailbox. This feels like 2010 all over again.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:17:25.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
