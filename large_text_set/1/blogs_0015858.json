In addition to The Notorious mouthing off as usual in the cartoon, we see a random appearance from Rambo, who saves Streep from a flying Monster energy drink. The action star then proceeds to shoot Joe Rogan while on the back of a pickup truck, a scene synonymous with his Rambo character. All in all the video was pretty out there, but still made us crack a smile. Here is the original video of Streep ripping the MMA at the Golden Globes a few weeks ago. Skip to 2:44 for her jab at the mma.

It's unsure where the animosity came from, but it doesn’t seem to be going to far. On the positive side at least we got a funny animated video to enjoy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:20:24.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
