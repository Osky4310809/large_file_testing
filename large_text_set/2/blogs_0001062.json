According to Billboard , an Adam Levine Hollywood Walk of Fame star will become a reality when the coveted entertainment honor is bestowed upon the Maroon 5 singer next month.\nSIGHS. Don’t mind us. We’re just over here preemptively fangirling over seeing Levine get showered with the epitome of star treatment. Luckily, fans and fangirlers alike will be able to watch Levine receive his star on February 10 thanks to an exclusive live stream of the event, which will take place on walkoffame.com. Levine’s The Voice co-star Blake Shelton and Sammy Hagar are scheduled to give speeches in celebration of the honoree.\n\nvia GIPHY \nYes, Adam. We also approve of your scheduled speakers and can’t wait to hear Shelton give you a heap of well-deserved praise (and also a hard time).\nAs everyone knows, last year brought Levine some rather spectacular moments as well, namely the birth of his daughter, whom he welcomed with wife Behati Prinsloo in September. That said, we couldn’t think of a better way for the singer to kick off the new year (and new month) than by becoming the 2,601st star recipient.\n“Adam Levine fans have been patiently waiting for this day,” Walk of Fame Producer Ana Martinez said in a statement. “Fans from around the world have been constantly checking with us saying, ‘When? When?’ Now is the time, and we invite all of Adam’s fans to join us and enjoy Levine’s ‘moves like Jagger!’ and hear his voice.” Levine will be recognized for his contributions to the recording industry, and as a 2017 star recipient, he’s in great company. Among the list of 2017 Walk of Fame honorees are late Tejana singer Selena Quintanilla , John Legend, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, NSYNC, Chris Pratt, Tyra Banks and Amy Adams.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:23:50.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
