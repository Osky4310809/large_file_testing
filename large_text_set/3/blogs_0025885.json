And Emma Roberts’ latest bow-centric ensemble — a sheer, black dress glammed up with bow accents — is high up on our list of red carpet favorites .\nAttending a press event in New York for her forthcoming film, The Blackcoat’s Daughter , this week, Roberts played on the film’s darker, more foreboding themes in her black dress, from Coach’s pre-fall 2017 collection. But she also stayed true to her more classic, feminine personal style by choosing a frock embellished with white, beaded bows.\nCompleting her look with glittering, gold and silver pointy-toe pumps, Roberts’ gave off a witchy-fashionista vibe, and we’re loving it. Rob Kim/Getty Images Roberts stayed true to Coach’s runway vision for this dress, pairing it with high-waisted black underwear and a black bralette, both visible beneath the frock. At its pre-fall show in December last year, Coach sent the dress down the catwalk with similar styling, switching up only the shoes with a pair of chunky sandals.\nA post shared by What They Are Wearing (@whattheyarewearing) on Mar 23, 2017 at 11:42am PDT \nIn The Blackcoat’s Daughter — which was first screened, to critical acclaim, more than a year ago at various film festivals and opens in limited release on March 31st — Roberts plays a woman who hitches a ride with a couple, but is hiding her own dark past.\nOn a recent Today Show appearance , she said the film is “actually terrifying.” She explained, “When I read the script, I knew I had to do the movie because it literally kept me up that night and I started getting really scared…it stuck with me.”\nEven though she’s not a big horror movie fan, she does always seem to be involved with scary projects (even Scream Queens had its moments!), so we’re definitely looking forward to seeing how she plays her role in The Blackcoat’s Daughter .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:15:58.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
