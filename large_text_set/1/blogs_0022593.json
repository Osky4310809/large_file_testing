Ryan plans to have dinner Monday with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus. \nTrump on Monday signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and another blocking taxpayer funding for international Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions and health care for women. Trump also signed an executive order instituting a hiring freeze for non-military federal workers. \n  \n\" President Trump is wasting no time acting on his promises,\" Ryan said a statement. \"Already, he has laid the groundwork to protect Americans struggling under Obamacare. He has renewed President Reagan's policy to ensure American taxpayers are not forced to subsidize abortions anywhere in the world. He has followed through on his promise to insist on better trade agreements. And by instituting a hiring freeze, he has taken a critical first step toward reining in Washington bureaucracy.\" Top Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:06:02.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
