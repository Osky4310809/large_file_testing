On January 13th Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, announced that her department found that members of the Chicago Police Department (CPD) “unnecessarily endanger themselves and result in the unnecessary and avoidable uses of force”. She blamed deficiencies in cops’ training and accountability as well as a failure to train officers in de-escalation tactics and to investigate them properly when they use force. The 164-page report paints a picture of a dysfunctional department whose officers disproportionally use force against blacks and Hispanics. “We found numerous incidents where CPD officers chased and shot fleeing persons who posed no immediate threat to officers or the public. Such actions are constitutionally impermissible,” says the report. It recounts such an incident: a man walked down a residential street with a friend when officers drove up, shone a light on him, and ordered him to freeze because he was fidgeting with his waistband. The man ran. Three officers gave chase and began shooting as they ran. They fired 45 rounds, including 28 rifle rounds, toward the man. Several rounds struck the man, killing him. The officers afterwards claimed the man fired at them during the pursuit; no gun was found on him. Another unsettling part of the report describes the use of force by cops against children. In one incident, officers hit a 16-year-old girl with a baton and then tasered her after she was asked to leave a school for carrying a mobile phone in violation of school rules. They claimed the use of a taser was justified because she flailed her arms when they tried to arrest her. “We found that officers shoot at vehicles without justification and in contradiction to CPD policy,” says the report. “We found further that officers exhibit poor discipline when discharging their weapons and engage in tactics that endanger themselves and public safety, including failing to await backup when they safely could and should; using unsound tactics in approaching vehicles; and using their own vehicles in a manner that is dangerous.” The largely scathing report has made public after a year that saw the highest rate of murders and shootings in Chicago for two decades. With 762 homicides and more than 3,500 shootings last year, Chicago was more murderous than New York and Los Angeles, the nation’s biggest and second-biggest cities, combined. Heather Mac Donald, the author of The War on Cops, a book subtitled “how the new attack on law and order makes everyone less safe”, blames the “Ferguson effect”, a term she coined, for the spike in killings. She argues that officers are far less actively policing since the shooting death by a white cop of a black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri, which emboldens criminals everywhere. Pedestrian stops were down by 82% last year, says Ms Mac Donald, who agrees with Chicago’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, who, controversially, claimed that cops had gone “fetal” after Ferguson. Ms Lynch's report is unlikely to restore the CPD's morale. But how useful is the DOJ investigation of its practices? “The report does not quantify the number of instances it alleges,” says Ms Mac Donald. It is misleading, in her view, to set investigations of police forces against a population benchmark, as this and other DOJ reports have done, rather than a crime benchmark. And bringing in a costly federal monitor is the wrong solution, she says. Policing is a local matter and can only be reformed effectively locally. The Justice Department and Chicago city officials signed an “agreement in principle” to keep negotiating what comes next, which may include federal oversight. The DOJ signed 20 such agreements with other police forces, including 15 consent decrees. On January 12th the DOJ agreed on the latest consent decree, which can be enforced by courts, with the city of Baltimore in order to push sweeping reform of the Baltimore police force. The decree calls for an independent federal monitor for the department, instructs cops to try to de-escalate before resorting to force and calls for them to be instructed on implicit bias in handling cases of sexual assault. The problem is that the DOJ’s agreements with Chicago and Baltimore come as Barack Obama leaves office next week. Donald Trump, his successor, presents himself as a staunch defender of the police. His nominee for attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, who will succeed Ms Lynch if he is confirmed by the Senate, blames the rising crime rates in Chicago and Baltimore on criticism of the police and low morale among officers. In Baltimore the courts now control the police-reform process. But Chicago will be the first big test of Team Trump's police-reform policies.
