Share this video Watch Next \nKatie Price has been lined up to surprise housemates alongside former Celebrity Big Brother contestant Stevi Ritchie and brand new housemate Chloe Ferry, according to The Sun. \nWhile Katie and former X Factor star Stevi have both experienced the craziness of the house in previous years, it will be a brand new experience for Chloe. \nAlthough as Chloe has survived the Geordie Shore house over the years, she should be well equipped to deal with whatever Big Brother throws at her! Chloe's best known for her party antics on Geordie Shore Sporting blonde hair at the MTV EMAs last year (Photo: WENN.com) \nA source told The Sun : \"If the celebs thought they’d drawn the short straw being locked up with Stacy and Austin, they’ve seen nothing yet. \n“Chloe has no filter – she will cause total pandemonium with or without a drink.” \nShe’s certainly had plenty of people to seek advice from; Geordie Shore stars Scotty T, Charlotte Crosby, Marnie Simpson and Ricci Guarnaccio have all appeared in CBB in the past. \nIt’s not the first time Chloe has been linked to CBB: rumours surfaced last year that she could surprise Scotty T with a late entrance during his series.

Fellow housemate Katie Hopkins memorably said: “It has started to smell like my dead hamster.\" Who is Stevi Ritchie? \nStevi found fame on The X Factor, finishing in sixth place on the 11 series in 2014. He walked away from the show with something far more important however: girlfriend Chloe-Jasmine Whichello, a fellow contestant. Stevi appeared with then fiancee Chloe on CBB two years ago (Photo: Channel 5) \nAfter getting engaged, they appeared together in the 16 series of CBB in 2015, alongside current housemate Austin Armacost , finishing in fifth place. \nThis time, however, Stevi is going solo: he recently reunited with Chloe after a brief split but she's not rumoured to be taking part. Who is Chloe Ferry? \nChloe found fame on MTV’s Geordie Shore and quickly became a fan favourite thanks to her hard partying, no filter persona (and love of chicken nuggets.) Chloe's a feisty character on Geordie Shore \nShe had an on-off flirtation with co-star Marty McKenna in the last series, and carried a torch for Scotty T . \nIn recent times she’s become just as famous for her appearance as her TV show, openly admitting to a nose job and other surgical procedures to boost her looks.
