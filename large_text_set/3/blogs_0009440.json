Read More Asked about his thoughts on the game It had all started so well with Walcott's thunderous drive (Photo: Getty) \n\"I think there are different aspects in this game to explain why we are out. \n\"I think we produced the game we wanted and we were really unlucky tonight with some decisions of the referee that are very difficult to understand. \n\"Because we are 1-0 up, it is 100 per cent a penalty on Walcott. [Theirs] it is offside. Lewandowski is offside. The crucial moment (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"There is no penalty on top of that you get the red card. \n\"Of course, that killed us, the game and after that it was very difficult for us to finish the game. Overall it's difficult to understand what happened. \n\"I still must say my team has produced a huge effort tonight and played very well.\" Was Laurent Koscielny's red card a turning point? Koscielny sees red (Photo: Getty) \n\"Yeah, of course. You are down to 10 men, you have to score four goals - it becomes in the heads of the players impossible you know. And I think what is terrible is he's offside, Lewandowski and there's no penalty. \n\"He [originally] gives a yellow card, on top of that he gives after a red card, it's just not serious. \n\"When you see the importance of the games and you see an attitude like that I am absolutely revolted and sorry for people who come and pay a lot of money to watch these games.\" Read More Does it hurt to be out at the last-16 stage again? Wenger on the touchline (Photo: Rex Features) \n\"Of course but I felt we were in it you know and you never know how Bayern would have reacted had we scored a second goal. \n\"And at the end it finishes like that it's difficult to take. \n\"Of course it looks very bad and doesn't reflect the quality of our performance tonight.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:29:42.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
