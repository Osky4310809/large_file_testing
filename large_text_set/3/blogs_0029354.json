Eric Thomas (@oureric) March 23, 2017 If he looks glum, it's just because he has to wait his turn to ride the Stationary Truck and that's no fun! Who doesn't want to ride the Stationary Truck? Everybody loves trucks! Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below And I know what you're thinking: those pictures didn't really look like enjoyment? Well, have you considered that you don't actually know what enjoyment is? Or truth? Or reality? Have you? I think it'll really help if you accept that you just don't know and let the president tell you. He's having the time of his life. Getty This is just how people drive. Don't believe me? Here are some other examples. Look at Carol from the 1999 comedy romp American Beauty , seen here having a blast behind the wheel.

And who could forget David, a young man afflicted with health insurance who takes a joyful ride after escaping the clutches of the dentist. GIF Oh, what fun it is to ride!
