The unusual combo has an apropos name: Slightly Toasted . It should open by the end of the month inside the former Mila One space at Clinton and Madison, according to Crain’s . Slightly Toasted is what the crew behind Oak + Char have been preparing for since their River North restaurant closed over the summer . They want to attract Metra commuters from nearby Ogilvie Transportation Center with counter service for coffee and pastries. But they 90-seat space will host a more formal atmosphere on Saturdays when they’ll serve from a prix fixe menu for a single nightly seating. \nOmar and Brenda are crushing the menu. Only a couple short weeks from opening! Posted by Slightly Toasted on Friday, December 23, 2016 Father and son owners Tyler and Art Mendoza are working with familiar faces from Oak + Char. Brenda and Omar Garcia, who spent time at Michelin-starred Elizabeth Restaurant, are in the sibling team charge of the food. Salads, sandwiches and plenty of baked goods will dominate the menu which also feature oysters. The toasts aren’t just the avocado kind. Varieties include a steak and eggs version.
