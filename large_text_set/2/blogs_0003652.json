Read on to learn what this means for you. \nUnity Asset Server is an asset and version control system with a user interface integrated into Unity. It was designed to be an integrated solution for team members working together on a project. Historically, Asset Server was a paid add-on product for the Unity editor, sold as part of the Team License add-on product suite that included Asset Server and Cache Server. Asset Server has not been in active development for several years, and in June 2016 we made both the Asset Server and Cache Server products free to use for all our customers. \nWhat is happening now? \nWe will be removing code from the editor that enables Asset Server to function as intended. Unity 5.6 will thus be the final version of the editor compatible with Asset Server. \nWhy is this happening? \nAs a legacy product, the Asset Server has only received minimal maintenance in the last years. Instead we have been focusing our efforts on our next generation solution, Unity Collaborate . Additionally, we are modernizing the internals of the Unity editor which means cleaning up and removing old code; including Asset Server. \nHow can I continue to use Asset Server with my existing project? \nYou can continue to use Asset Server with Unity 5.6 or older, but you won’t receive any additional support or features going forward. If you need to download Asset Server, please refer to this forum thread that includes all relevant download links. \nWhat are my alternatives? \nOne of the main reasons people use Unity Asset Server is that it’s a version control system that is well integrated with Unity. So, if you’re looking for a similar solution, try Unity Collaborat e . It’s a cloud-hosted solution that makes it easy for teams to save, share, and sync their Unity projects. It’s currently in Beta, and you can use it now with Unity 5.5+. \nIf you prefer a traditional solution, see our documentation for Version Control , where you’ll find alternatives and how to use them with Unity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T20:06:55.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
