King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 6 \nLinkin Park have posted two videos regarding their yet-untitled follow-up to 2014's \" The Hunting Party \" - one featuring the boys discussing the essence of the new record, and the other one featuring a sample of the fresh goods played on piano. \nGuitarist Brad Nelson noted : \"I think it's a personal record. I don't think it's about politics, the world outside - a lot of these songs are personal, I feel like the person singing is speaking directly to me in a revealing way. There's an intimacy, but it's not introverted.\" \nVocalist Chester Bennington chimed in: \"There are songs that don't talk about a specific situation, they talk about a frame of thinking. This is the shit that's going on inside my head or something I'm dealing with; to me, it tells a story but it's also revealing as well, and that feels honest to me.\" \n\"We're trying to connect with people. We're trying to make a record that has stellar songs that people want to listen to all the time.\" \nYou can check out that musical sample below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:11:14.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
