Especially when the LS shares the LC's GA-L platform. Unfortunately, it didn't pan out that way. It is possible to spot cues inspired by the LF-FC concept , such as the lower contour of the windows, the crease in the metal leading up to the rear wheel, and of course the lights and spindle grille. But they're overshadowed by the fact that this LS has a significant amount more girth. slide-4338125 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338133 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338128 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338130 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338129 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338132 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338127 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338131 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338099 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338095 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338096 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338098 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338093 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338097 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338105 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338104 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338144 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338142 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338107 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL slide-4338126 2018 Lexus LS 500 Image Credit: Joel Stocksdale / AOL Just because it doesn't live up to the concept doesn't mean it's a bad looking car. It's far more interesting to look at than the dated, upright LS currently on dealer lots. It also sits quite low and the wheels and tires fill the wells nicely, which gives it a road-hugging stance. There are some nifty design details, too, such as the glass that is completely flush with the pillars. slide-4338542", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T16:13:39.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
