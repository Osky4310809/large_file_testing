Several of the \"Bujingis\" appear to be based on the ten treasures known as the Tokusa no Kandakara (\"10 varieties of the god’s treasure\") which are enshrined at Isonokami Shrine . They were holy items given to Nigihayahi, an ancestor of the Mononobe clan , by Amaterasu and brought to earth when she descended from Heaven. These treasures were essentially magical items that could be used in rituals for the purpose of exorcism or purification. In particular the three \"Bujingis\" featured on the \"Regalia\" series of spell and trap cards are based on the three Imperial Regalia of Japan , all of which were supposedly crafted by the gods. Also, the four \"Bujin\" Xyz Monsters are based off of the four children of the Shinto creator gods Izanami and Izanagi : Kagutsuchi was, briefly, a god of fire and pair's final child together– as his birth caused Izanami to die. The other three children– Amaterasu the Sun goddess , Tsukuyomi the moon god , and Susanoo the storm god – were born from Izanagi wiping his face after failing to bring Izanami back from the land of the dead. Every \"Bujingi\" that forms part of \" Bujintei Susanowo \" is made of light red energy, every \"Bujingi\" that forms part of \" Bujintei Kagutsuchi \" is made of light blue energy, every \"Bujingi\" that forms part of \" Bujintei Tsukuyomi \" is made of bright yellow energy, and every \"Bujingi\" that forms part of \" Bujinki Amaterasu \" is made of dark purple energy. In addition, all of \"Bujinki Amaterasu's\" \"Bujingi\" components form a special subset of the \"Bujin\" archetype as a whole. Each is a corrupted counterpart to one \"Bujingi\" from each of the \"Bujintei\" monsters, plus \" Bujingi Wolf \". With the exception of \" Bujingi Warg \" each of these monsters is specifically a counterpart to a \"Bujingi\" featured in the art of the \"Bujin Regalia\" series, referencing the mythical connection between the goddess Amaterasu and the real-world Imperial Regalia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T11:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:10:50.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
