We feel very disappointed,\" Pochettino said at a post-match news conference, before confirming Tottenham must wait for Vertonghen's swelling to subside in order to fully survey the damage. \n\"It looks very bad but we need to wait and assess him on Monday or Tuesday.\" \nEven if Vertonghen does prove to be a long-term absentee, Pochettino insisted he will not be forced into the January transfer market for a replacement. \n\"No - no change,\" he said. \"We have Ben Davies, Kevin Wimmer has played against Watford and Aston Villa. We have plenty of players. \n\"We won't need another centre-back.\" \nVertonghen's anguish took some of the shine off a majestic Spurs display, with Harry Kane's hat-trick pushing them up to second in the Premier League table â€“ four points behind Chelsea ahead of the leaders' trip to face champions Leicester City. \n\"I'm very proud. The effort was amazing and fantastic. We played wonderful football,\" Pochettino said. \n\"The way we played they could not compete with us. We have learned a lot and matured since last season.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:36:32.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
