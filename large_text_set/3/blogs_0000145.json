That is hilarious.”\nHe mockingly continued, “Don’t use anonymous sources except for the ones we send out to you anonymously. Those anonymous ones are awesome.”\nSmith also asked Wallace about whether there was “conflict” at the luncheon he attended between Trump and the anchors from networks he doesn’t like. Wallace said the luncheon ended up being very “hospitable” and warm, telling Smith that Trump is certainly very different in private settings.\nWe will add video when it becomes available.\n[ image via screengrab ]\n— —\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac\n ", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Ftv%2Fshep-smith-hilarious-that-wh-gives-us-anonymous-sources-after-trump-bashed-us-for-it%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shep-smith-chris-wallace-1.jpg&description=Shep%20Smith%3A%20%E2%80%98Hilarious%E2%80%99%20That%20WH%20Gives%20Us%20Anonymous%20Sources%20After%20Trump%20Bashed%20Us%20for%20It", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Ftv%2Fshep-smith-hilarious-that-wh-gives-us-anonymous-sources-after-trump-bashed-us-for-it%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://twitter.com/#!/feldmaniac"], "published": "2017-03-01T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:14:02.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
