Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nArsenal sent scouts to watch Monaco's stars as they sent Manchester City out of the Champions League. \nGunners scout Gilles Grimandi was in the French Riviera to watch Kylian Mbappe and Benjamin Mendy, report the Metro. \nBoth were instrumental in the 3-1 win over Pep Guardiola's side as they shocked the Citizens and qualified for the quarter-finals. \nThe Gunners have a long-standing interest in Kylian Mbappe and their France-based scout was on hand to watch him again as he scored in a 3-1 victory. \nBoth Mbappe and Mendy were called up to the France squad on Thursday also.

But he was immediately loaned out before being sold to Eibar for just £1.3m last summer. \nArsene Wenger is understood to have had Lejeune scouted on a number of occasions with favourable reports each time. Wenger discusses Barcelona target Bellerin's future at Arsenal (Photo: Getty) \nArsene Wenger has dismissed fresh talk linking Hector Bellerin with a move to Barcelona, declaring he has an \"unbelievable\" amount of time left on his contract. \nReports in Spain this week claimed Arsenal and Barca were in talks about a £35m return to the Nou Camp for Bellerin. \nArsenal signed right-back Bellerin, 21, from Barcelona's academy in 2011 and has been repeatedly been linked with a switch back to Spain. \nBut he signed a new deal worth over £100,000-a-week that runs until 2023 in November and Wenger said: \"We just extended contract. \n\"He has an unbelievable number of years to go. It’s very difficult to take these things seriously.\" Wenger hits back at critics \nArsenal's under-fire manager Arsene Wenger has aimed a shot at his detractors, claiming nothing he does is good enough anymore, writes Liam Corless . \nThe Frenchman has been widely criticised in recent weeks - by fans and pundits - with the Gunners out of the Champions League and well off the pace in the Premier League title race following another mid-season capitulation. \nFans of the north London club are calling for change, with a number of supporters protesting outside the Emirates prior to last week's 5-1 home defeat by Bayern Munich - a result which sent Arsenal crashing out of Europe by a humiliating 10-2 aggregate scoreline. \nArsenal go to West Brom in the league on Saturday and, in his pre-match press conference on Thursday morning, Wenger was asked what would constitute a successful season for his side. \n\"Success, it's not down to me to judge that. I'll leave that to you,\" the 67-year-old responded. \n\"Our job is to do as well as we can until the end of the season. We want to play in the Champions League next season. \n\"We have a tough job because there are six or seven teams fighting for the places and how well we do until the end of the season will, of course, depend on that. \n\"We are in the semi-final of the FA Cup, we have an opportunity to do that as well. Overall, that's our target. Pirlo hints at why Arsenal struggle in Europe   \nAndrea Pirlo reckons he knows why clubs like Arsenal are struggling in the Champions League., writes John Cross. \nSince Chelsea won the trophy in 2012 and the glory days of the mid to late noughties when the Premier League dominated, there has been a steady and very depressing decline. \nThere must be a reason and some of football’s biggest names believe it comes down to the English style and perhaps a drop in their standards of defending. \nFormer Juventus and Italy star Andrea Pirlo said: “Maybe English teams need more of an Italian style to manage games on the pitch. \n“Manchester City were favourites against Monaco but they did not develop the necessary game to win the second leg. \n“Guardiola was not able to transmit his style to the players which was so dominant for Barcelona and Bayern Munich.” poll loading Will Arsene Wenger still be at Arsenal next season? 5000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T07:50:21.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
