Whitney Thore is not actually pregnant, which disappointed her excited baby daddy and ex-boyfriend, Lennie Alehat . On the Tuesday, February 7, episode of My Big Fat Fabulous Life , Whitney found out that despite multiple positive pregnancy tests, she will not be a mom. PHOTOS: Celebrity Splits of 2016 \nWhitney had to retrace her steps and un-tell her closest friend and ex-boyfriend that she was pregnant. However, almost immediately after finding out the news, Whitney flirted it up with Roy again. That didn’t take long. Check out our five favorite moments from Tuesday’s episode.

While at the doctor, she ended up testing positive again, and the doctor did an ultrasound to check everything out. However, it turned out a cyst in her ovaries was causing the tests to come back positive, and Whitney could not feel more confused. PHOTOS: Cutest Celebrity Baby Announcements \n“I don’t know how to feel right now — in the moment, I just feel sad,” Whitney said. \nEven though she admitted she was not ready to have a child, it’s hard to not feel bad about how excited she was getting to start a (possibly dysfunctional) family of her own. \nLennie Is Devastated \nAs if telling Lennie she was pregnant last week wasn’t hard enough! Whitney had to face her baby daddy and tell him the truth, which left her wondering if she would ever see her ex again. PHOTOS: Biggest Celebrity Cheating Scandals Ever! \n“My sister said we could get some baby clothes from her, and I found a crib on Craigslist,” Lennie said excitedly when the two met up for coffee. Oh, if only he knew. \nOnce she actually told him, Lennie was visibly disappointed. He confessed he was excited to start a new lifestyle and wants to someday have a child. Let’s hope he didn’t put a down-payment on that crib, poor guy. \nThings Heat Up Between Whitney and Roy \nAfter the baby drama with Lennie, it didn’t take long for Whitney to play the field again. She Skyped called her boss and crush, Roy Brown, which she said was a “more intimate experience” than she anticipated. Although she was exaggerating a bit, there was an unusual chemistry between the two. \nWhitney flirted with Roy as he awkwardly tried to talk about work. He got even more uncomfortable when she brought up his alleged girlfriend. Whitney thinks he is lying about being in a relationship, but maybe that’s so she feels better about coming on to him so much. \n“I guess I just have to leave the ball in his court, but he’s dribbling,” Whitney said as she was thrusting. “And he wants to shoot it into my basket.” Well, fingers crossed Whitney gets the slam dunk she’s looking for. \nBabs Spills The Beans \nWhitney has an awkward encounter with her parents, who heard from a relative that she was pregnant after she kind of broke the news on live radio. They were furious but ultimately relieved that their daughter wasn’t going to be an unmarried mother. \nDuring Heather and Buddy’s birthday, Whitney accidentally “assaulted” the cake with her breast, leaving a stain on her shirt. Whitney’s mom, Babs Thorne, made a joke out of it and accidentally told all of Whitney’s closest friends about the pregnancy scare that they were previously in the dark about. \n“Even though she does look like she’s lactating, I just found out Whitney is not pregnant,” Babs said. \nEveryone’s jaw hit the floor, including ours. But can anyone really get that mad at Babs? Whitney might have felt “violated” at the time, but she has to admit, it was pretty hilarious.
