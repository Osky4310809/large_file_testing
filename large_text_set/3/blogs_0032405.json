PUBLISHED: 16:21,  56, Wed, Mar 29, 2017 \nMr Muscat, whose country is this session's European Council President, said he was sad to see Britain go but said Europe will be resilient. \nThe prime minister, who campaigned against Malta joining the EU in 2004, said: \"I think it’s bitter bitter, there’s nothing sweet about what’s happening today. \n\"It’s a sad day but obviously the will of the people has prevailed in the direction it has prevailed. Related articles European nations WILL be made to share illegal migrants says Juncker \n\"I think what will emerge in the next few weeks and months is that Europe is resilient. \n\"Despite people thinking it’s obvious 27 different countries might diverge on their views on such an important issue, I think Europe will surprise with its degree of resilience, unity and wanting to go forward. \n\"I do think it’s a good thing Prime Minister May has finally sent in her letter and I think the Commission, through Michel Barnier, is doing an exceptional job in preparations and looking through the nitty gritty. \n\"Michel said the degree of detail they’re going into - he told me 'do you know how many cats and dogs cross from Dover to Calais on the pet passport?'. \n\"He said 250,000 and we need to find a solution for the simplest of things, the details. I'm glad there is someone looking at the technicalities not just the headlines. \n\"It will be tough but I think there’s a willingness to arrive to a fair solution for everyone.\" European Commission Joseph Muscat joined Jean-Claude Juncker at a citizen's dialogue in Malta \nHe was joined by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EC member in charge of environment, maritime affairs and fisheries, Karmenu Vella at a 'Citizens' Dialogue' in Valetta, Malta. \nThe event was held as part of the EU's 60th anniversary celebrations to discuss the bloc's future ahead of EU elections next year - just hours after Theresa May triggered Article 50 to start two years of negotiations to leave the union. \nMr Muscat, who originally campaigned against Malta joining the EU, added many people outside Europe are now seeing the EU as the only beacon of free trade in the world right now. European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker revealed many young people are disenchanted with the EU \nHe told a politics student: \"While we’re celebrating 60 years of Europe, we forget the 500m Europeans haven’t all been in Europe for 60 years. \n\"People from founding fathers’ states who are too young and also very old who have been in for two years but they are very old. \n\"Thinking we can be homogenous in our thoughts is an illusion. This is our strength. \n\"I was deeply struck by what Pope Francis said last Friday. \n\"The treaties of Rome give rise to political and economic reality but most of all a human reality. \n\"Last week in London, was there any Brexit from solidarity? Did people say 'they’re leaving so we won’t have sympathy?' No. \n\"This is a genuine union which can’t be dissolved. \n\"Pope Francis said there are differences but these should not be mended with uniformity but harmony. \n\"Those are words of wisdom which make us blush as politicians because he gave more leadership in 30 minutes than I’ve heard in so many meetings. \n\"We happen to be a neutral state in Malta and I advocate this neutrality serves us and Europe well in the centre of the Mediterranean, where more people need to trust each other rather than arm themselves up. \n\"I’ll end with another quote from Pope Francis. During the lunch hosted by Italian President Matarella he said Europe is made up of countries which are small and countries who haven’t realised they’re small. \n\"This is why we’re together. We will be smaller in the next few years but there's a call for us to be much bigger than we are because of others rescinding on their duties on climate change and because other countries see us as the only beacon of free trade and those who believe it shouldn’t be just about austerity and economy but growth and social rights. \"That’s why we shouldn’t rev ourselves up. \n\"Most of you know I campaigned against joining the EU but our country has behaved since then, we’ve come together irrespective of who is in government and who will be in the government in 10 years, is a tribute to how it should work.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T20:00:01.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
