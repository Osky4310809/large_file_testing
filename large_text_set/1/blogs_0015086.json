This theory is so interesting If there’s one all-encompassing truth about Star Wars fans, it’s that we like to think about the Star Wars universe a little too much. Every detail and every moment have been mulled over by fans of all ages for over 40 years. What’s truly amazing is that we keep finding fan theories that can surprise us and challenge our view on the movies, no matter how many times we’ve seen them! That’s why we love this fan theory from Cracked that goes over the reasons that Star Wars could’ve taken place in our universe !\nWe know this sounds pretty crazy and out there, but hang in! \nWhile it is definitely kind of jokey and tongue in cheek as far as fan theories go, it does actually have some good points. The first thing brought up is the appearance of ducks in the Star Wars universe.\nThat’s right, you heard us: ducks. Ducks are mentioned in the official novelization of a New Hope. They also show up in The Phantom Menace , not only in speech but actually existing on film! There are also bees in Phantom Menace, snakes in Degobah in The Empire Strikes Back , rats is Jabba’s palace in Return of the Jedi , and owls and horses on Endor in the Ewok’s made for TV movie Ewoks: The Battle for Endor . There are also numerous colloquial references throughout the films such as “Die Jedi, dogs!” and “I’ll see you in hell!” which are very much earth bound phrases.\nNow, obviously since these Earth-creature references span over 40 years of Star Wars media, and cross everything from the original series, prequels, books, and made for TV movies, it is quite possible (probable, even) to believe that they’re there by accident. Somewhere in the writing room, someone forgot that maybe it’s weird if the Ewoks are riding horses. (But is it though? They’re both so furry!)\nCracked, however, goes along with the assumption that if these Earth references are purposeful, Star Wars takes place in a galaxy, far, far away, and when we see the stars at night, we are actually seeing light that has taken a long time to reach us, that the Star Wars universe takes place around the time the dinosaurs existed on Earth. If that is true, they assert that it’s possible that a ship from the Star Wars universe crashed on Earth carrying humans and all the animals referenced, triggered the collision that killed the dinosaurs, and ushered in the existence of humans and the Earth animals we know and love today.\nLong story short, this theory tries to argue that we, humans, are the descendants of the humans from the Star Wars universe! Clearly, this is a long shot, and yes, maybe we should go outside more often and get some fresh air. However, it is really fun to think about, we’re super grateful to Cracked for bringing this crazy fan theory to our attention!\nIf you want to see for yourself, watch the full video below:\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T04:11:26.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
