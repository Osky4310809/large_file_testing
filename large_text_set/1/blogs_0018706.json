Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nHugo Lloris insists Tottenham showed they are no longer a soft touch after claiming they proved they are ready to fight for the title. \nLloris apologised for his two goalkeeping howlers which helped Manchester City go 2-0 ahead in Saturday's draw at the Etihad, and the France international admitted that in previous years they would have gone on to suffer a heavy defeat. \nBut captain Lloris says they have improved their mental strength in recent seasons and believes that is their best quality and why they can win the Premier League. \nAfter the match ended 2-2, he said: “We talked with each other at the end of the game and it’s a big change from the past.

The first goal is a bit unlucky, the second one was a mistake - my personal mistake - and maybe we would have given up. But not anymore. \n\"The last two or three seasons we’ve changed our mentality and we’ve shown it. Even on a bad day, it’s a great point.” \nLloris also spoke up on behalf of the goalkeepers’ union to support under-fire Claudio Bravo who only faced two efforts on target - and let them both in. \nBravo was brought in by City to be a sweeper keeper like Lloris and the Spurs keeper insists Bravo can still be a success, especially as it took him time to settle in England when he first arrived at White Hart Lane. \nLloris said: “Listen, there is always part of luck in football. He’s proved he’s one of the best keepers in the world with his national team, with Barcelona. It’s his first season in English football. \n“The only thing is that coming after Joe Hart is never easy.

It’s just a question of time, I know as a keeper that sometimes you try to do your best, you want to do more to help the team. \n“It can happen, but you need to stay calm with that, he’s got a lot of experience, he’s a great keeper and I’m not too worried for him.” \nTottenham striker Harry Kane also believes they are proving they have got the mental strength to challenge for the title. \nKane said: “It was one of our worst performances of the season so to come away to City, play bad, go 2-0 down and come away with a point shows how far we’ve come. \n“A few seasons ago, it probably would have gone 3-0. 4-0, and that would have been that. But we dug deep. We know it wasn’t a good performance and we dug deep and came away with something.
