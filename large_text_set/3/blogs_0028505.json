No. 11-seed Xavier University beat No. 2-seed University of Arizona in a 73-71 win, clinching a spot in the Elite 8. The team is only one win away from securing a Final Four spot so this game was a big deal for everyone involved. Xavier faces Gonzaga tonight at 5 p.m. CT and we’re hoping for a win so we can see more of superfan Bill. \nMurray’s been at every tournament game Xavier’s had so far so their winning streak rests on his shoulders. 2 — John Marshall (@jmarshallap) March 24, 2017 3 — NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) March 24, 2017 \n.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:02:59.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
