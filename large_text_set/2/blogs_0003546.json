Especially with a decent date range and so many cities. Weirdly enough, flights beginning from USA to Aus cities are nearly always more expensive than vise versa. Think this is United/AA's way of telling everyone to leave the country and not use their return ticket. Fine by me. These are major US airlines so none of these 56 hr trips, 1.5hr @LAX yiew! \nPlayed around with a few sites via Scott's mainly: \n1. E.g. FlightMojo US$669 JFK-Syd-JFK www.flightsmojo.com/ Over the last 2.5 years, we've bought 8 flights this exact route and this is the cheapest we've had it. 2. Momondo.com: www.momondo.com/ 3. Google Flights is good for general view of calendar then book Direct from AA/United (not cheapest for many both flights we booked but from this is how we eventually for those prices at FlightMojo. Travel Periods \nBeg immediately in Feb and found flights until the end of June e.g. we're flight Syd-JFK Jun 20 Aus Cities:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:48:16.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
