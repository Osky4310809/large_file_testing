To have a guy like that who has the confidence, who understands what we have and what we need and isn’t afraid to voice it, we encourage that.”\nRelated: Carson Wentz Says He Won’t Promote ‘Wentz Wagon’ Stuff \nWentz threw for 3,782 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions while completing 62.4 percent of his throws as a rookie last season.\nAlong with Jackson, some of the other veteran potential free-agent wide receivers the Eagles could target include Alshon Jeffery, Kenny Stills, Kenny Britt, Terrelle Pryor, and Pierre Garcon.\nTeams can begin negotiating with free-agents on March 7th.\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:28:37.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
