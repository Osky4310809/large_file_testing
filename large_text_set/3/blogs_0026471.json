Climate change helped cause Brexit, says Al Gore \nFormer Vice President echoes warnings from US military that global warming is causing dangerous political instability  19   Online This Brexit campaign poster was compared to Nazi propaganda Reuters \nBrexit was caused in part by climate change, Al Gore, the former US President Al Gore has said, warning that extreme weather is creating political instability “the world will find extremely difficult to deal with”. \nMr Gore, speaking at an event in which he previewed a sequel to his landmark 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, said the “principal” cause of the Syrian Civil War had been the worst drought in 900 years, which forced 1.5 million people to move from the countryside to the cities. \nThere they met a similar number of Iraqis who had fled the conflict in their homeland, creating powderkeg conditions that Syrian government officials privately feared would explode.

The then Chancellor, George Osborne, described the poster as “disgusting and vile” and, like others who explicitly compared it to Nazi propaganda, said it had “echoes of literature used in the 1930s”. \nMr Gore, whose new film An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is due out in the UK in August, told an audience at an event held by Advertising Week Europe in London: “This collision between the power of industrial civilisation and the surprising fragility of the Earth’s ecosystem now poses a great danger that could even threaten the future of human civilisation itself. \n“One of the lines of investigation [scientists] have been pursuing has led them to the conclusion that significant areas of the Middle East and North Africa are in danger of becoming uninhabitable. \n“And, just a taste of this, to link it to some of the events that the UK and European Union are going through – think for a moment about what happened in Syria. \n“Before the Gates of Hell opened in Syria, what happened was a climate-related extreme drought. \n“From 2006 to 2010, 60 per cent of the farms in Syria were destroyed … and 80 per cent of the livestock were killed. The drought in the eastern Mediterranean is the worst ever on record – the records only go back 900 years, but it’s historic. \n“And 1.5 million climate refugees were driven into the cities in Syria, where they collided with refugees from the Iraq War. \n“Wikileaks revealed the internal conversations in the Syrian government where they were saying to one another ‘we can’t handle this, there’s going to be a social explosion’. There are other causes of the Syrian civil war, but this was the principal one.” Syr: Utrecht's restaurant staffed by refugees Syr: Utrecht's restaurant staffed by refugees 1/17 16/17 17/17 \nThe war broke out in 2011 as people took to the streets during the Arab Spring protest movement against dictators in the Middle East and President Bashar Assad responded by sending in the troops. \nMr Gore said this had produced an “incredible flow of refugees into Europe, which is creating political instability in Europe and which contributed in some ways to the desire of some in the UK to say ‘whoa, we’re not sure we want to be part of that anymore’”. \nHe said this kind of political instability was being felt by a number of countries around the world. \n“Some countries have a hard time even in the best of seasons but the additional stress this climate crisis is causing really poses the threat of some political disruption and chaos of a kind the world would find extremely difficult to deal with,” Mr Gore said.
