Nadhim Zahawi / Twitter / Via Twitter: @nadhimzahawi ID: 10417408 Nadhim Zahawi / Twitter / Via Twitter: @nadhimzahawi ID: 10417407 \nZahawai said it was a “sad, sad day to feel like a second class citizen. Sad day for the USA!” \n“I’m a British citizen and so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear I’ll be banned from the USA based on my country of birth,” he added. \nI'm a British citizen & so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear ill be banned from the USA based on my country of birth — Nadhim Zahawi (@nadhimzahawi) ID: 10417414 \nAccording to a statement from the US State Department seen by the Wall Street Journal , Trump’s 90-day ban on issuing visas to people from seven countries – Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen – also applies to dual nationals from any of those countries, even if they hold other passports. \nPrime minister Theresa May has so far refused to criticise Trump’s executive order, saying US immigration policies were for the US to decide , but there are signs of a growing backlash in her own party against this stance. \nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it could not comment on whether British dual-nationals were affected by the executive order.
