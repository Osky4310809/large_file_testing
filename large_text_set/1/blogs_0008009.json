The documents show Prince had no money tied to the stock market; however, he did own 67 10 ounce gold bars valued at $836,166.70. And that’s not all. The documents also show Prince had “$110,000 in four bank accounts, unclaimed property, capital credits and cash,” while his companies—Paisley Park Enterprises Inc., NPG Records Inc., NPG Music Publishing, and LotusFlow3r—had over $6 million in cold, hard cash. We’re not done yet: He also owned 12 Minnesota properties that are worth more than $25.4 million combined. The Star Tribune reports Prince’s estate has been valued between $100 million and $300 million before taxes; however, that range is just an estimate. The managers of his estate are still assessing his assets, including his jewelry, vehicles, furniture, and art, as well as his music catalog, trademarks and copyrights. Pending lawsuits against Prince’s businesses can also affect the value of his estate. According to the Star Tribune , there will be a hearing on Jan. 12 to determine who will inherit Prince’s fortune. The singer died without a will, so it’s likely everything will be split between his sister, Tyka Nelson, and his half-siblings Sharon Nelson, Norrine Nelson, John Nelson, Omarr Baker, and Alfred Jackson.
