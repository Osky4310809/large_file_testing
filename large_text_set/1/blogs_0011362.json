In a tweet posted at 6:18 p.m. EST, it called Martin Luther King, Jr. Day \"Great Americans Day.\" \nNon-emergency municipal offices in Biloxi will be closed on Monday in observance of Great Americans Day. — City of Biloxi (@CityofBiloxi) January 13, 2017 One might have been tempted to chalk this up to a mental cramp, but this was not a slip-up; the city's official name for the holiday is, in fact, Great Americans Day . This has been the city's name for the holiday for at least a decade. —▶️ (@G_Pop2013) January 14, 2017 The city responded to backlash with a tweeting stating, \"the city did not name this holiday.\" \n@CityofBiloxi The city did not name this holiday In fact, Biloxi touts MLK celebrations in our city. Visit https://t.co/xmExVuHERf Mississippi is one of three states that celebrate Robert E. Lee Day and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day on the same date . Arkansas and Alabama are the others. Biloxi posted a comment on its Facebook page stating, \"The City of Biloxi did not declare nor name this holiday. The holiday was declared and named by the state Legislature. The city, in fact, as it has done for years, touted our upcoming MLK celebration in a Bmail and on the city website this afternoon.\" However, one legal sleuth was able to unearth something that certainly looks like the city naming the holiday . \n@CityofBiloxi According to the Biloxi Code of Ordinances, helpfully linked on your city website, the city did in fact name this holiday. pic.twitter.com/ RTd92dpMKB — Rose Nissen ( @RoseNissen ) January 14, 2017 \n@CityofBiloxi The ordinance was unanimously passed by the Biloxi City Council on Dec. 31, 1985. https://t.co/ 4j38fPddk9 pic.twitter.com/ vyZajhrM4c Twitter users were perhaps even more stung because Biloxi is a city in Mississippi , a state where Confederate pride still runs rampant and where a student placed a noose on Ole Miss' James Meredith statue last year . The social network was both bewildered and fed up. \nThat is...not the name of the holiday. https://t.co/oW01UYNH3I — Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) January 14, 2017 \n@CityofBiloxi hahahahahaha someone thought they were smart and subtle they are actually dumb and racist.
