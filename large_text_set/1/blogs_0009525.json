Though the King of Rock (allegedly) died in 1977, new theories argue that he’s still walking the earth in those blue suede shoes. \nElvis Presley was 42 years old when he died of a heart attack at his Graceland home in Memphis, Tennessee. But if you ask devoted Elvis fans and the occasional oddball, Elvis never died. In fact, the King has been walking around unnoticed, only popping up occasionally when a person is lucky enough to spot him in all his glory. Kind of like Bigfoot! \nNobody can give a straight answer as to why Elvis would fake his own death, or where he’s hiding the majority of the year when people don’t see him — kind of like Santa! — but they’ve got one common belief: He ain’t resting in peace in Memphis. Even on his 82nd birthday, January 8, 2016, Elvis’ death, or lack thereof, is suspicious. Elvis Presley — See Pics \nSome point to the fact that police never photographed his death scene, which you have to admit is pretty strange. We can buy that one. But a stranger theory comes from the spelling of his name on his tombstone: Elvis Aaron Presley. Aaron is in fact his given middle name, but he chose to spell it “Aron” for some reason. Therefore, people think it’s an indicator that this is not the real Elvis buried there! \nRight after Elvis died (“died”), his manager, Col. Tom Parker , told reporters , “Elvis didn’t die. The body did.” He added that he’d “talked to him this morning.” Way to set the world off! Sightings include a mother-daughter duo claiming that Elvis was chowing down at a Burger King in Michigan in 1988, and a tourist at Graceland purportedly seeing the king casually raking some leaves. Okay! \nPerhaps the best conspiracy theory of all is the one that popped up right before Elvis’ 82nd birthday. Some believe that Elvis was a background character in the 1990 movie Home Alone . No, really. In the scene where Kevin McAllister’s mom ( Katherine O’Hara ) is talking to the gate agent at the airport when she figures out they left him…well, home alone…Elvis is supposedly the man standing in line behind her. \nThe guy is a little grizzled, and doesn’t have quite the same finesse as the Elvis we knew and loved, but that makes sense. He’d be 55 years old at that point, getting a little grey, and apparently living incognito for over a decade. It takes a toll on a guy! While it doesn’t seem too likely that the only time we’d see Elvis over the years is when he wants a Whopper or scores a bit part in a John Hughes movie, it’s nice to know that there’s something constant in life: Elvis truthers. \nHollywoodLifers , do you think Elvis is alive?
