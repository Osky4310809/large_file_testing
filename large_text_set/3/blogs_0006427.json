The particular color of navy used in this collection also gives the range an extremely wearable vibe; simple from a distance, but luxuriously detailed up-close. The capsule is set to release March 8 at Kith’s Maxfield shop.\nFind Out More Be sure to also check out Fear of God’s previous collaboration with Vans. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:13:20.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
