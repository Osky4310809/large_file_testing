And it didn’t matter. \nThe Ducks held off a late Jayhawks rally to come out with a 74-60 Elite Eight win. \nThe victory sends the Ducks to the Final Four for the first time since 1939. The three seed will be seeking their second NCAA tournament championship, the first coming in the inaugural event in 1939 when they were a member of the Pacific Coast Conference. \nOregon opened a 44-33 lead at halftime and struggled for much of the second half before closing strong to post the 14-point victory. \nFreshman Jordan Bell was a force all over the court, a one-man disruption force scoring 11 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and eight blocks — including this beauty: There must be like 18 Jordan Bells on the court. He is EVERYWHERE. pic.twitter.com/7mc5QSqt5V \n— CBS Sports (@CBSSports) March 26, 2017 \nTyler Dorsey was Oregon’s top scorer with 27 points. \nKansas’ Frank Mason III finished his career with 21 points. \nNo doubt Oregon coach Dana Altman, who struggled mightily against Kansas when he coached at Kansas State, found the victory particularly sweet. \nOregon’s next stop is in Glendale, Arizona, where the Ducks will face the winner of Sunday’s North Carolina – Kentucky match on April 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T08:57:32.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
