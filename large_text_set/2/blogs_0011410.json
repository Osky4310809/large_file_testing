Even worse? General Flynn lied to the American people about whether his conversations with the Russian Ambassador ever happened. #FireFlynn \n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 13, 2017 Michael Flynn has proven he cannot be trusted to serve America’s best interests and national security instead of Russia’s. #FireFlynn \n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 13, 2017 These are not the actions of a man who can be trusted with the security of our nation. General Flynn must go. #FireFlynn \n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 13, 2017 President Trump’s National Security Adviser Michael Flynn should be fired. pic.twitter.com/VZgTAtUNFn \n— D.

Nonexistent. . @CNN reporting Flynn resigns. But after Post story tonight, he leaves a lot of thorny questions for admin in his wake. \n— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) February 14, 2017 Question dangling out there: Is it even remotely possible that Flynn took these actions re Russia without consulting *anyone*? \n— Ellen Barry (@EllenBarryNYT) February 14, 2017 Resignation doesn't answer what did trump know and when… \n— Eddie Vale (@evale72) February 14, 2017 Isn't it possible that Trump told Flynn to talk to the Russian ambassador about sanctions and knew Flynn lied to Pence? \n— Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) February 13, 2017 Now we need to know what did Trump know about Flynn's links with Russia & when did he know it? Also what exactly are Trump's ties to Russia? https://t.co/xWBgXn5YJC \n— Steven Greenhouse (@greenhousenyt) February 14, 2017 After Flynn resignation, interesting to see if Kremlin continues to deny there were conversations about sanctions before Trump took office. \n— Steve Rosenberg (@BBCSteveR) February 14, 2017 While it's great that Flynn resigned, still plenty we don't know about Trump & Flynn's relationship & communication with Russia \n— Karen Finney (@finneyk) February 14, 2017 This is only the beginning.
