when Leeds United, with Harry Kewell, led the Premier League at the turn of the new year in the 2001-2002 season. \nFor Leeds fans, it likely feels like another life ago. \nRio Ferdinand, Jonathan Woodgate, Ian Harte, Alan Smith and Paul Robinson were part of an emerging crop who, under the management of David O’Leary, made a Champions League semi-final and looked like they had the world at their feet. \nEven though they finished fifth that season, won by Arsenal, no one could have envisioned the sad slide to come. \nBut 26 games into the current Championship season, Garry Monk’s side sit third on the table, on 48 points, six points adrift of the automatic promotion places currently occupied by Brighton and Newcastle United. Could this finally be Leeds’ time to return to the top? Harry Kewell in 2001. Source: AP \n“We all want to be successful. We all want to make it the ambition of this club, the ambition of the players, the ambition of myself and everyone here to get into the Premier League. That’s where you want to be,” Monk said. \n“But I’m not fixated on it. I’m not saying to the players every day, ‘We need to get there, we need to do this, we need to do it now’. I focus on the process. We all want it as quickly as possible, of course we do, but I’m not in a rush. The players aren’t in a rush. \n“What they have to be is ready to improve and fight as hard as they can for three points. That’s all that matters because it takes you to where you need to be in the long run. Come the end of the season, we’ll discuss it if we find we have an opportunity but there’s a long way to go until we reach that point.” Garry Monk, right, matching wits with Jurgen Klopp. Source: AFP \nFrom last season’s relegation crop, Rafa Benitez’s Newcastle look a good bet to return immediately to the top flight after last season’s debacle. Aston Villa are now getting a feel for life below the top flight, while yo-yo life might have caught up with Norwich, currently 11th. \nLeeds are one of many fabled top flight clubs who have been caught in the quicksand after relegation, a reminder that no club is too big to go down. Or stay down. \nHere are the prominent clubs that have disappeared from our screens this century. \nLEEDS UNITED \nChampionship position: 3rd \nOverall England position: 23rd \nA dire warning of spending too much, too quickly, which was exacerbated by the club’s relegation in 2003-2004 after having sold top-line stars like Ferdinand, Kewell and Woodgate. A ray of hope was dashed in the play-off final against Watford, starting a painful downward spiral, which included administration, relegation to League One for three seasons, a rollcall of managers and a points deduction as punishment for their shambolic financial plight. The current success is impressive given the backdrop of the controversial ownership of Massimo Cellino and his penchant for sacking managers. Cellino, who was banned by the FA for 18 months, has sold 50 per cent of the club to Andrea Radrizzani, an Italian TV rights mogul. Massimo Cellino.

Like so many fallen PL clubs, they have been beset by financial troubles, relieved via Milan Mandaric and then Dejphon Chansiri buying the club since 2010. They lost to Hull City in last season’s play-off, but eye a romantic promotion for next season - the club’s 150th. \nDERBY COUNTY \nChampionship position: 7th \nOverall England position: 27th \nThe Rams are back in contention for the play-offs, a gradual bounce back after begin relegated as the worst Premier League club ever in 2008. They spent a number of years in the middle of the Championship under Nigel Clough’s stewardship, before Steve Maclaren took them to the cusp of PL promotion until his was sacked for a poor end to 2015. He is now back in charge, however, after Nigel Pearson was sacked in October for a bust-up with the club’s chariman, who reportedly watched training from a drone, concerned by a poor start to the campaign.

But things stagnated badly in 2013 under the new ownership of Shahid Khan (who purchased the club from Mohamed Al-Fayed) and management of Martin Jol, in a season featuring three managers, with Felix Magath replacing Rene Meulensteen after 17 games. They were a circus under Magath in the Championship and he was gone by September 2014, despite a Championship-record spend to prepare for the season. Last season was a great escape, finishing 20th, but they have steadied the ship under Serbian Slaviša Jokanović, who has attracted Bundesliga and La Liga attention for his rescue job.

Source: AP \nASTON VILLA \nChampionship position: 13th \nOverall England position: 33rd \nLife in the second tier has only been brief for the giant of English football but unlike Newcastle United, they weren’t able to stop the rot from the PL once in the Championship. Roberto Di Matteo was sacked 12 games into the season and despite Steve Bruce’s initial rescue job, it’ll take something special to return to the top flight next term. They’re currently owned by Chinese businessman Tony Xia, who bought the club in June for £76 million. \nBIRMINGHAM \nChampionship position: 12th \nOverall England position: 32nd \nThe definition of England’s ‘yo-yo’ club, fluctuating between divisions, Birmingham went down under Alex McLeish in 2011 – in the same season they won the League Cup over Arsenal! After losing a play-off semi-final to Blackpool the next year, they’ve been left in 12th, 21st, 10th and 10th in the disappointing years since. Under Chris Hughton, the side had the strange balancing act of the Europa League and Championship; Lee Clark and Gary Rowett and been in charge since but there was a huge escape in 2013-2014, with final-day survival thanks to a point at Bolton – coming from two goals down with 15 minutes to go to save their status. \nIPSWICH TOWN \nChampionship position: 14th \nOverall England position: 34th \nMick McCarthy is now in charge of a side that was last in the PL in 2002, a season that earned the club a UEFA Cup spot thanks to Fair Play rankings, which they had to balance while they were in the second tier. Relegation sent the club into financial administration. McCarthy saved the club from relegation in 2012-13 and has since steered them to three top-10 finishes. Roy Keane had an 18 month spell in charge of the club, when he replaced Jim Magilton in 2009. If that name sounds familiar, it’s because he was Melbourne Victory boss in 2012.

That erratic experience for their fans continued, with a record points haul to return to the Championship the next season.

Under the ownership of the Al-Hasawai family since 2012, the club has gone through a rollcall of managers and is currently under the temporary stewardship of Gary Brazil, with Philippe Montanier sacked this week. \nBLACKBURN ROVERS \nChampionship position: 22nd \nOverall England position: 42nd \nThe surprise 1994-1995 PL winners now find themselves in a relegation battle in the Championship, after relegation from the top flight in May 2012. The unpopular Steve Kean lost his post in September that year on the way to a 17th-placed finish. Five managers later, Owen Coyle is currently in charge of a club that hasn’t finished in the play-off spots since going down. Venky, the Indian poulty firm, still own the club, but much to the displeasure of supporters who are desperate to reclaim ownership of the stricken club. “We’ve spent five seasons outside the top two divisions in our entire history but that’s going to be the legacy Venky’s leave behind,” Mark Fish, chairman of the Blackburn Rovers Football Community Action Group, said last year. “To put us there and leave us there.” Last year they conducted an ‘1875’ protest - arriving after 18 minutes, leaving after 75 - a nod to the club’s inception.

They’re the only FA Cup winners to get relegated in the same season. They’re now in a precarious position again, in the relegation zone, after having been promoted on the back of Will Grigg fever (the striker was prolific with 25 goals, becoming a fan favourite with a viral song made about him) last season with a run of one loss in 23 matches. After Roberto Martinez’s departure, the club has gone through five managers, with Warren Joyce currently in charge. Owner Dave Whelan handed over the chairmanship to his grandson in 2015. \nBOLTON \nLeague One position: 3rd \nOverall England position: 47th \nThe Wanderers were a Premiership staple, best known under Sam Allardyce, enjoying 11 top flight seasons, including four top-half finishes. But their position slid in each of their four seasons in the Championship, culminating in a disastrous 24th-placed finish last term. It was a season mired by massive debt, a transfer embargo, a 17-match winless streak under Neil Lennon and the real prospect in January of copping a winding-up order after being £172.9m in debt - which they avoided thanks to being bought by Dean Holdsworth’s Sports Shield consortium and Ken Anderson’s Inner Circle, with the matter settled by March. They’re in the third tier for the first time in 24 years. \nCHARLTON ATHLETIC \nLeague One: 11th \nOverall England position: 55th \nAfter Alan Curbishley’s long and steady tenure at the Valley, it has been sadly turbulent on the park for Charlton - this is the second time they’ve hit League One since Alan Pardew couldn’t salvage their PL status in 2006-07. Protests over the ownership of Roland Duchâtelet and Katrien Meire have been long and exhausting, most famously when fans carried a coffin in 2016 to lament the loss of the club’s heart and soul.

That downfall included a rent dispute that meant the side played a season in Northampton, 34 miles from Coventry, until a return to the Ricoh Stadium in 2014. During that time, attendances plummeted to as low as 2,348. \nFA Chairman Greg Clark said in 2016: “Coventry City is a very, very sad case. \n“It’s a fine football club 20 miles from my home town and I still remember them winning the FA Cup. \n“Their fans have had a torrid time and the bad blood that now exists between the owners, the fans, the local council has failed to be healed by multiple acts of mediation by the Football League.” \nPORTSMOUTH \nLeague Two position: 4th \nOverall England position: 72nd \nThe south coast club looked like they had consolidated their PL existence under Harry Redknapp. Then, disaster. Three relegations later, they’re in the fourth tier of English football since their PL demise mired in well-documented financial problems in 2011 - despite making the FA Cup final against Chelsea that year. \nNot only were the club in dire on-field form, but found themselves entering administration again for unpaid taxes, and had a European arrest warrant out for their owner, Russian Vladimir Antonov, in 2011. He later resigned but by then, the playing squad was decimated. \nPompey was plunged into administration again in 2012, suffered points deduction punishments, went 23 games without a win in 2012-2013 but now, under the ownership of Portsmouth Supporters’ Trust, the major re-build begins - which included declaring the club debt free in September 2014.
