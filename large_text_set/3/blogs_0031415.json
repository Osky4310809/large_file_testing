(It’s basically why the phrase “creative differences” exists.) Not so former Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air star Janet Hubert, who followed her high-profile ouster as the show’s first Aunt Viv with a ton of statements about how star Will Smith was a human-shaped rapping devil that had forced her off the show. Hubert was still publicly pissed at Smith as recently as 2009, when she wrote a tell-all memoir about her time on the beloved ’90s sitcom, deriding Smith as an egomaniacal monster and co-star Alfonso Ribeiro as his lickspittle lackey.

Still, it’s a little shocking to hear how vitriolic the actress still is, 23 years after the fact: \nI know the media hoe Alphonso Ribero has posted his so called reunion photo. Folks keep telling me about it. He was always the ass wipe for Will. There will never be a true reunion of The Fresh Prince . I have no interest in seeing any of these people on that kind of level.” \nDamn, Aunt Viv!
