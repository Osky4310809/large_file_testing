Productions shot during the quarter that received the credit included the James Franco-Bryan Cranston comedy “Why Him,” “Battle of the Sexes,” “Latin Lover” and “Please Stand By.” \nLocal on-location feature production increased 9.7% to 1,309 shooting days in the second quarter. Productions covered by the state incentive program — which provides a tax incentive of up to 25% of production costs — accounted for 108 days of filming.

TV drama production increased 3.8% to 1,042 days and pilots soared 89.1% to 278 days. Web-based TV jumped 20.6% to 527 days. \n“There’s simply no place like Los Angeles County, where you can walk around the corner and find yourself in the middle of a film set that has turned the streets into New York City or Gotham City,” said Los Angeles County supervisor Don Knabe. “Film production is booming and the large and small businesses that benefit from the industry are feeling the benefits, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs, directly and indirectly.” \nApproximately 38%, or 395 days, of TV drama production was incentive-driven. \nCommercial production levels held steady, declining 0.4% to 1,243 days.
