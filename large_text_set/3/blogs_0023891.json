Right now, the major streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime are offering tons of documentaries and series about chefs , plus movies and programs that are set in restaurants and bars. Here are a few recommendations from Eater editors on what to stream this weekend: To Stream: Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories Available on: Netflix The Gist: As a narrative construct, few tropes emerge more often than that of the night owl, the solitary existence of functioning primarily after dark. Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories — Netflix’s 10-episode version of the Japanese television show, itself based on a popular manga — gives those lonely figures a safe space in the form of the titular diner, run by an owner (Kaoru Kobayashi) referred to only as “Master.” And in a rare case for a scripted series, the show takes those night-owl stories and immediately makes them feel real. Each episode, named for a different dish cooked up by Master, functions as vignette, zooming in on the life of one particular client: In “Corn Dog,” an aging comedian and his assistant come to terms with their professional rivalry, in “Tonteki,” a woman shows her affection for unavailable men by knitting elaborate sweaters. It sounds unbearably serious — and the stories are perhaps uncomfortably honest sometimes — but they’re also consistently funny, heartwarming, and hopeful. The food isn’t the primary reason why Midnight Diner ’s customers patronize Master’s establishment (that would be for the community and the A+ advice he doles out, of course), but for us viewers, those shots of omelette rice and hot pot are just as lovingly rendered: They will make you hungry, then angry that you don’t have a spot in your neighborhood just like this. Midnight Diner ’s compelling episodesfunctions as a great reminder of the simplicity and complexity that come with being human. It’s an odd feeling, the idea that a deep dive into a (fictional) stranger’s life can provide as much comfort as, say, nursing a bowl of ramen IRL. But these are weird times, and Midnight Diner is the catharsis we all need — Erin DeJesus To Stream : The Restaurateur Available on : Amazon Prime The Gist : Years before he launched Shake Shack and a slew of other popular restaurants, NYC restaurateur Danny Meyer opened two very different projects inside one iconic Manhattan building: Tabla and Eleven Madison Park . The former was an immediate hit, while the latter got off to a shaky start and took years to find its footing. The Restaurateur fixes its lens on Meyer and his partners during the openings of these two high-stakes projects. The vintage footage of these establishments in their earliest days is a treat for NYC restaurant buffs. But the real reason to watch this doc is to see one of America’s greatest restaurateurs working through the most challenging period of his career with grace, if not ease. The film starts with Meyer in 2009 telling the camera: “After opening Tabla and Eleven Madison Park, I was pretty convinced I had made the absolute worst mistake of my entire professional life.” — G .M. To stream : Prohibition Available on : Netflix, Amazon Prime The gist : Ken Burns documentaries aren’t for everyone. But, the filmmaker’s 2011 effort is worth a watch for viewers who enjoy acutely detailed historical accounts, Sam Waterston voice acting, and slow zooms on black-and-white photographs. The three-part, five-hour series explains America’s booze ban that was in effect from 1920 to 1933, obviously. Burns covers the origins of the prohibition movement in the mid-1800s, how the execution of the Volstead Act only led to more drinking and the rise of organized crime, and lessons learned from the so-called noble experiment. The biggest highlight comes in episode three, which excerpts old New Yorker stories from nightlife columnist Lois Long. Images of Long, who was the perfect example of a flapper, and her words bring to life scenes from New York City’s Jazz Age in a way that is unmatched by fictional movies. — Chris Fuhrmeister To Stream: Drinking Buddies Available on : Netflix The Gist : The characters in Joe Swanberg’s comedies slide in and out of uncomfortable situations in ways that might make you squirm a bit, if only because they are so true to real life. Drinking Buddies , a not-quite-romantic comedy set in the world of craft brewing, is a good introduction to this guy’s work, and it features terrific performances from Olivia Wilde, Jake Johnson, and Anna Kendrick. Almost every scene of this movie has people drinking (or making) craft beer. — G .M. To Stream : Mind of A Chef Potluck Music Special Available on : YouTube, the Mind of a Chef homepage The Gist : Mind of a Chef ’s quasi-holiday special — which just got nominated for a Daytime Emmy — is an epic hangout session between Danny Bowien, April Bloomfield, Sean Brock, Iñaki Aizpitarte, and Anthony Bourdain. The special has some amazing looking food — including Brock’s crab rice and Bowien’s “beggars duck” — but the best part of this hour-long program is April Bloomfield’s trip home to the English countryside, where she remembers her nan’s Sunday roast. Check out the special in its entirety above. — G.M. February Recommendations To Stream : A Cook’s Tour Available on : Netflix, Hulu The Gist: This Food Network show captures Anthony Bourdain traveling the world a few years after the publication of his hugely influential book, Kitchen Confidential . A Cook’s Tour definitely lays the groundwork for future Bourdain endeavors like No Reservations and Parts Unknown , but the energy is a bit different here — Bourdain seems giddy and genuinely grateful for the opportunity to learn about food communities around the world for the first time. It definitely looks and feels like a program that was produced for very little money 15 years ago, and Bourdain hasn’t fully developed his TV persona yet here, but the lo-fi production value is also part of its charm. Episode 1 features a tour of the legendary Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo, and a visit to a sumo den. — G .M. To stream: Diner Available on: Amazon Prime, iTunes The gist : Before all of the dialogue-forward, somewhat plotless series and films of the 1990s and 2000s, there was Diner . Released in 1982 and set in mid-‘50s Baltimore, it follows a group of scattered high school buddies who reconnect in their hometown for a wedding. Much of the action takes place at the local 24/7 diner, where Kevin Bacon, Mickey Rourke, Daniel Stern, and Paul Reiser, all so young and adorable, shoot the shit about growing up and the banalities of adult life. — C .F. To Stream : Twin Peaks Available on : Netflix The Gist : This strange ‘90s detective drama from director David Lynch is getting a revival in 2017 but you can watch the whole series (two very brief seasons) on Netflix now. While the show isn't so much about food, some of its best-loved catch phrases revolved around dining. Watch as Kyle MacLachlan's Agent Cooper relishes in the quaint logging town's fare, from the Double R Diner's damn fine coffee to the cherry pie and of course the mandatory police station doughnuts. Meanwhile, the Bang Bang Bar, better known as the Roadhouse, hosts ethereal singers crooning into microphones. By the end, you'll be talking backwards and wearing plaid. — Brenna Houck To stream: Seinfeld , Season 7 Available on: Hulu Plus The gist: So much of Seinfeld revolves around dining even though the show isn’t technically about food. Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer spend the vast majority of their time at Monk’s coffee shop and various fictional restaurants around New York City. But, a number of episodes are food-centric, and Season 7 features some of the best. There’s “The Soup Nazi,” which introduced one of the show’s many iconic one-liners. “The Calzone” has Larry David at his best as a faceless George Steinbrenner. And “The Rye” closes with one of Seinfeld’s most memorable images: George Costanza fishing for a loaf of bread out of a second-story window. — C .F. To Stream : Jim Gaffigan: Cinco Available on : Netflix The Gist: Noted food nerd Jim Gaffigan spends a lot of his new Netflix special talking about full-contact eating. A sample joke: “I don’t want to brag, but I’ve done it — I’ve kept my New Year’s resolution. I’ve had pasta every day this year.” He also has bits about eating cheese in Wisconsin, getting stopped by the TSA with a sleeve of Krispy Kreme doughnuts in his bag, and Jesus’s ability to stay in “amazing shape” while “multiplying bread whenever he wanted.” — G .M. To stream: Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee Available on: Crackle The gist: Jerry Seinfeld’s latest project continues his legacy of making shows about nothing. In this case, the web series’s title explains it all: Seinfeld recruits fellow comedians to chat about their lives over coffee and during rides in classic automobiles. Anyone who is troubled with the current executive branch of the United States would be wise to queue up the episode in which Seinfeldinterviews President Barack Obama from the White House mess. — C .F. To Stream: Curb Your Enthusiasm, Season 3 Available on: HBO GO The Gist : Season 3 is Curb Your Enthusiasm ’s real sweet spot — a batch of episodes that’s full of memorable plot lines, hilarious reveals, and great riffing from a cast of very funny people. It’s also the season where much of the action revolves around the opening of a fictitious Los Angeles restaurant that counts Larry David and Ted Danson as investors. Curb Season 3 is not a satire of the dining world so much as a comedic look at what would happen if a bunch of people made a series of of awful decisions while opening a restaurant. It’s not for everyone, but if you like Seinfeld and sardonic comedy in general, Season 3 is a great place to dive into Curb Your Enthusiasm . — G .M. To stream: Treme Available on: HBO GO The gist: Writer and director David Simon is best known for creating The Wire , but in Treme , he captures the struggles and culture of life in post-Katrina New Orleans over the course of five seasons. The series addresses music, politics, crime, and commercialization, but the Big Easy’s restaurant scene, which was decimated after the 2005 hurricane, provides innumerable storylines. One of Treme’s main characters, chef Janette Desautel, faces the hard truths of running her own kitchen and latching onto funding from big investors who want input on the menu. Another frontwoman, LaDonna Batiste-Williams, operates a New Orleans dive bar of so many hard drinkers’ dreams. — C .F.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T08:50:28.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
