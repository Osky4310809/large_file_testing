The Food Standards Agency has said bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. \nThere have been a number of outbreaks of the virus, including one at a farm in Louth , Lincolnshire in December. \nEarlier that month, poultry keepers were told to keep their birds inside for 30 days to protect them from a highly-infectious strain of avian flu in Europe. \nThe H5N8 bird flu strain has been found in poultry and wild birds in 14 countries, including Germany and France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:51:13.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
