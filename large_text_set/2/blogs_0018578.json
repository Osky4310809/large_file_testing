While sitting down for an interview with film journalist Laurent Weil on Rencontres de Cinema , the Caesar Award winner was all smiles when it came to the subject of his growing family. \"We are really happy and really excited. It's going to be an adventure,\" he said, before adding that, \"We've sort of embraced it all . . . with arms wide open.\" The 55-year-old Money Monster star also revealed that his friends were very supportive when he told them the news, although they made sure to crack a few jokes. \"It got really quiet,\" he said. \"And they all just started making baby crying noises, and the whole table just busted up laughing.\" \nGeorge and Amal, who met through mutual friends in 2013 and tied the knot a year later , are reportedly having a boy and girl (according to George's mom, Nina, who recently spilled the beans in Vogue ). Judging from how sweet the soon-to-be-parents are right now, we should all brace ourselves for how ridiculously cute their family is only going to be once the twins arrive.
