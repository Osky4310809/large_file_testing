Type the word “crunchies” into our Messenger bot or click here to purchase tickets with just a few clicks. \nAfter purchasing the ticket, the bot will also send a scannable QR code. Everything is done within Messenger. Take a look at how it works. \nTo get back to the tickets, type “crunchies” into the bot. It will give a list of options to chose from, including the ability to see tickets. \nAlthough prices to the Crunchies will increase later this week, we’re keeping the discounted price exclusively on the bot. Hopefully the discount will give everyone a little extra incentive to give the bot a try. \nThe TechCrunch bot is one of the first few Messenger bots to allow payments, and the first bot where users can buy tickets to an event. The bot was built by Chatfuel, and more info about its launch can be found here . Messenger Native Payments are currently available for US users only. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:04:37.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
