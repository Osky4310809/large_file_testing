REUTERS/Carlos Barria TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY - RTX2Z764 Email \nPresident Trump says if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is unable to muster the 60 votes necessary to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court , he should change the Senate rules and allow Gorsuch to be confirmed with a simple majority of senators -- a parliamentary procedure known as the “nuclear option.” \nAsked during a meeting with business leaders what he’d say to Democrats who will try to block Gorsuch’s confirmation, Mr. Trump said “I think there’s a certain dishonesty if they go against their vote from not very long ago,” alluding to the fact that Gorsuch’s confirmation to the federal court was supported by a number of Democratic senators. “If we end up with the same gridlock,” Mr. Trump said, “I would say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear.” \nIt would be “a shame,” the president added. “It’s up to Mitch, but I would say, ‘Go for it.’” \nSoon after Mr. Trump made his comments, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer responded, tweeting that “60 votes produces a mainstream” Supreme Court justice. 60 votes produces a mainstream SCOTUS Justice & the need for a mainstream, consensus candidate is greater now than ever before. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) February 1, 2017  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:50:24.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
