In his tweet, Blass referred to a smartphone that may be in the works with the model number SM-N950. Because the Note series has so far used the name scheme N9xx this is the first tangible indication we have seen that Samsung will not only be sticking with the Note series , but that it will release a Galaxy Note 8 this year. Samsung Galaxy S8 models are indeed skipping SM-G94* model numbers, will ship as SM-G950 & SM-G955. Know what else is in the works? SM-N950. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) 9. November 2016 \nPreviously, the Note devices were unveiled in August, so we might see the Galaxy Note 8 make an appearance in August 2017. This would allow Samsung quite a lot of time to ensure that their new model does not come with the same faults as the Galaxy Note 7. \nAs the Note 8 is currently under development, the manufacturer had to choose a code name. And, according to SamMobile , it is being called Great. This is contrary to a previous rumor that said the Note 8 would be called Baikal, after the Siberian Lake considered to the be the largest freshwater reserve on Earth. SamMobile also revealed that the model number of the international unlocked device would be SM-N950F, with the ending letter subject to change based on the market. This is consistent with the model number given by Evan Blass in the tweet mentioned above. Galaxy Note 8 display \nAccording to a leak from CNbeta, the Note 8 will have a 4K 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display. The display will be a double-sided curved screen, with no physical buttons. The fingerprint scanner will thus be on the back like the Galaxy S8.

At the bottom, we find a USB Type-C port, headphone jack, and S Pen slot. \nThe same CNbeta leak mentions that the Note 8 will likely have 6 GB of RAM, 256 GB of expandable internal storage and the same processor as the Galaxy S8: the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or Exynos 8895.

Best VR headsets Galaxy Note 8 software \nOther new rumors relate to the software innovations that the Galaxy Note 8 will be bringing. As mentioned above, the Note 8 might adopt an ultra-definition VR feature and have improved stylus functionality. Bixby, Samsung's rumored artificial intelligence feature that is also presumed to be on the Galaxy S8, could also be making its way to the Note 8. \nDo you think that Samsung will continue the Note series? Or should Samsung replace the Note series with, for example, a foldable phablet ?
