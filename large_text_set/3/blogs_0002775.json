However, just three weeks into his first Premier League season, he picked up an injury which ruled him out for five months, followed by a collapsed lung which delayed his return even further. After finishing that season with just four league games, he was in and out of the squad for the following campaign as they dropped to the Championship. \nDe Jong moved back to Netherlands this season, joining PSV on loan. Although he is yet to nail down a regular starting spot, he has proved decisive when needed - scoring the winner against Go Ahead Eagles and a late equaliser to upset Ajax in Amsterdam. \nAs well as starting his first Eredivisie game of 2017 in Saturday's 4-0 win over Roda, De Jong added two more goals to his name. As PSV try to claw their way back into the title race, the Netherlands international hopes to further prove to Newcastle that he is worth including in their plans next season if they make it back into the Premier League. \n\"This summer I will have conversations with Newcastle United and I hope they give me a new chance to show what I can do,\" he told Goal . \"For me it's important that they get promoted back to the Premier League. \nVIDEO: Pogba header shocks Feyenoord \n\"It's difficult to follow Newcastle's matches in Netherlands, but every week I check the results and try to stay in contact with the people over there. \n\"I also stay informed on Twitter and i'm still a member of the What's App group chat with Newcastle players.\" \nThough PSV's chances of silverware this season are slim as they sit eight points adrift of Eredivisie leaders Feyenoord, Newcastle are sitting five clear at the top of the Championship having beaten the second and third placed teams in their last two games.
