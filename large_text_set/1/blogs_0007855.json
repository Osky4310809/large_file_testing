It is sung by Finn , with Marceline and, to a much lesser extent, Princess Bubblegum singing occasional harmony. Princess Bubblegum, BMO , Jake and Marceline played the tune. It was the only song that was able to successfully open the Door Lord 's magic door. In this song, Finn confesses to Princess Bubblegum that his item that was stolen was a lock of her hair and that he considers the three his best friends and asks them what do they think of him in return. Contents Everyone, Bubblegum, I'm so dumb, I should've just told you What I lost, was a piece of your hair Now it's gone, gone forever, but I guess, what does it matter When I just, just had all of you there Oh, just had all of you there with me, my friends If you're even my friends. You like this? This is what was missing. The truth! What am I to you? Am I a joke, your knight, or your brother? What am I to you? Do you look down on me 'cause I'm younger? Do you think that I don't understand? I just wanted us together and to play as a band, Last night was the most fun I've ever had, Even liked it when the two of you would get mad...at each other. Oh, you a-a-a-a-are my best friends in the world. You a-a-a-a-are my best friends in the world. And That's ri-i-i-i-ight, I'm talking about the two of you girls, And you Jake, I wanna sing a song to you and I refuse to make it fake. What am I to you? Am I a joke, your knight, or your brother? What am I to you? Do you look down on me 'cause I'm younger? Do you think that I don't understand? I just wanted us together and to play as a band I'll forget that I lost a piece of your hair I'll remember the pasta that we shared...over there. Ah ah, you a-a-a-a-are my best friends in the world. You a-a-a-a-are my best friends in the world. And that's ri-i-i-i-ight, I'm talking about the two of you girls, And you Jake, I'm gonna sing a song to you and I refuse to make it fake.
