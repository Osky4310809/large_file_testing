Along with Tuesday’s foggy weather, Environment Canada says the city will get some of the coldest temperatures for the winter season so far.\nA mild air mass produced by the rain on Tuesday resulted in a fog weather advisory issued by Environment Canada that may cause “visibilities near 200 metres in some locations,” including Toronto, Hamilton, Halton-Peel, and the York-Durham regions.\nThe foggy conditions will be dissipating overnight with a night-time low of -1 C, according Environment Canada.\n“The temperatures on Tuesday are 7 C warmer than they should be for this time of year,” according to Dave Phillips, senior climatologist with Environment Canada.\nArticle Continued Below But, brace yourself, Toronto — near the end of the week, the city will be getting a taste of the coldest phase of the season so far.\n“The remainder of the week will be chilly as the cold arctic air moves over the city,” says Phillips.\nOn Wednesday, the weather agency is predicting a day-time high of -5 C in the city with mainly cloudy skies and a 30 percent chance of flurries. Night-time temperatures are expected to remain at -5 C but will actually feel like -15 C with wind chill.\nOn Thursday, Torontonians will get another day-time high of -5 C with a 30 percent chance of flurries. Night-time temperatures will be at a low of -11 C but will feel like -14 C.\nFriday will follow a similar pattern with a day-time high of -6 C and a low of -11 C.\n“What we see this week are the coldest temperatures this winter so far,” said Phillips. “Although the weather doesn’t look like winter, it sure will feel like it.”\nThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Delivered daily to your inbox.
