As they sat in a car, he asked, “What’s one of the advantages of becoming a singer?” \nHani responded, “I feel like I’ve kind of become a daughter my parents can be proud of.” \nShe happily added, “My real name is Hee Yeon. But when we’re in a restaurant, my dad calls me Hani because he wants to show off.” \nThe singer explained, “Before, no one recognized me even though I was a celebrity. I left [home] on my own to work [as a singer] so I felt sorry for not having any achievements.” \nShe said, “My mom and dad were extremely against it, so my mom gave me a time limit of three years. I promised that if I didn’t succeed after three years, I would stop [singing] without regrets. \nHowever, Hani continued, “Right just before three years, things turned out great. Since I was doing well, my mom said, ‘I approve. I was wrong.’ I got goosebumps then. It was the best. I was prouder than when anyone else said that. I think the person I most wanted to be acknowledged by was my mom.” \nMeanwhile, EXID is going strong, having recently celebrated their fifth anniversary in February.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T04:44:54.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
