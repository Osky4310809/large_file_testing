Finnish manufacturer HMD Global Oy purchased the rights to market products with the Nokia brand. The company plans to launch a “modern” version of the Nokia 3310 on February 26th at the Mobile World Congress.\nWe don’t know much about the phone’s return to the global market, other than that it will cost $63. \nHMD plans to launch smartphones at the Barcelona convention as well, but to be honest, we’re only here for the Brick.\nShutterstock We hope the new versions of the phone will still have “Snake,” arguably one of the most legendary phone games of all time, included. We could use another healthy dose of nostalgia right now.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:36:37.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
