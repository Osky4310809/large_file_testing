With a rank of 92, it had fared much better than India (118) and Bangladesh (110) last year as well. \nIndia, in contrast, slipped four slots from last year. \nNorway displaced Denmark as the world's happiest country this year. The Nordic nations are the most content, showed the report, produced by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) â€“ a global initiative launched by the UN in 2012. \nCountries in sub-Saharan Africa, along with Syria and Yemen, are the least happy of the 155 countries ranked in the fifth annual report released by the UN. \n\"Happy countries are the ones that have a healthy balance of prosperity, as conventionally measured, and social capital, meaning a high degree of trust in a society, low inequality, and confidence in government,\" Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the SDSN and a special advisor to the UN Secretary-General, said. \nThe aim of the report, he added, is to provide another tool for governments, business, and civil society to help their countries find a better way to wellbeing. \nDenmark, Iceland, Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden rounded out the top ten countries. South Sudan, Liberia, Guinea, Togo, Rwanda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Central African Republic were at the bottom. \nThe complete report can be read here . 0 0 Pakistan is happier than India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh: UN report   Geo News, World News, World Happiness Report 2017, Pakistan Happier Than India, Un Report.   \"Pakistan is happier than India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh: UN report\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/135063-Pakistan-is-happier-than-India-Sri-Lanka-Bangladesh-UN-report .
