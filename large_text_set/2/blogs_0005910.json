Judge Nathaniel Gorton denied the extension, allowing the stay to expire Sunday. Boston Federal Judge Nathaniel Gorton rules he will not renew last weekend's restraining order that blocked President's executive order #wbz \n— Christina Hager (@HagerWBZ) February 3, 2017 \n“People need to understand that due process rights apply to everyone on American soil,” Carol Rose, Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said before the decision was handed down. “We’re hoping this order will be extended so that people can know that America remains a haven for people coming from around the world…and a place where freedom and justice for all and equal protection remain.” Supporters of a block against Trump’s immigration order gathered in Boston Friday. (Photo from WBZ-TV’s Christina Hager) \nAttorney for the U.S. Government, Joshua Press, defended Trump’s order. \n“They’re essentially reading this as a Muslim ban because that’s what they want to see,” he said. “There’s nothing in here talking about Islam.” \nState Solicitor Bessie Dewar, from the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office, called it “a prematurely sweeping order that was not based on actual fact.” \nACLU attorney Matt Segal gave a warning. \n“There’s going to be substantial chaos around the world if this temporary restraining order is lifted,” he said. “What we’ve seen in the last week, people have been thrown into chaos, their lives have been upended. What we’re talking about is affecting people’s lives every day.” \nJudge Nathaniel Gorton seemed skeptical of the ACLU’s arguments, saying immigration law allows the President “broad powers.” Denying the stay extension means the city must enforce Trump’s order when the temporary block expires Sunday. \nHowever, immigrant advocates gained a victory on the West Coast late Friday. \nA federal judge in Seattle has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s travel ban. \nU.S. District Judge James Robart granted a temporary restraining order Friday at the request of Washington state and Minnesota that’s effective nationwide. \nLawyers for the U.S. government argued the states don’t have standing to challenge the order and said Congress gave the president authority to make decisions on national security and admitting immigrants. \nWashington Attorney General Bob Ferguson had sued, saying the order is causing significant harm to residents and effectively mandates discrimination. Minnesota joined the suit this week. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries. CBS RADIO and EYE Logo TM and Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc. Used under license.
