The films he has created there using Lego bricks have attracted commissions from the BBC, the British Red Cross and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. \n“It’s amazing how you can learn a whole new craft just by being online,” says Spence who learned his animation skills by watching YouTube videos. \nSpence recently spent four months creating an animation for Renfrewshire council to champion his neighbouring town Paisley and support its bid for UK City of Culture 2021. The animation film supporting Paisley’s city of culture bid. \nThe three-minute film showcases Paisley’s architecture, history and most famous alumni. David Tennant, Andrew Neil and Gerard Butler (who on Friday tweeted “Honoured to make the cut, especially in Lego form. @Paisley2021 , you have my support!”) all make an appearance in lego form, as does Golden Shred marmalade and weavers making the Paisley pattern. A lego Paolo Nutini plays out the film. It is this storytelling part of animation Spence likes best. \nHis career in animation began during his last year of primary school, age 13, when the class were studying world war two.

It wasn’t to the best of standards but it got a good reception and it made me think about expanding on the new skill I had learned.” \nLego, a childhood favourite, was a tool at the 13-year-old’s disposal. “Animation and Lego go hand in hand it is very functional and is the perfect scale for animation – not too big and not too small – plus it’s very colourful.” He began to upload his creations to YouTube and build his online profile.

Electronic DJ Paul Oakenfold emailed “out of the blue” and asked the animator to create a music video for his single Who Do you Love. He constructed his most elaborate set to date – a stage surrounded by over 50 trees and a crowd of Lego minifigures. \n“It was a shock for a young schoolboy – and unchartered waters because I had never worked for anyone before and suddenly I was working with a team of professionals and had a deadline to meet,” he recalls. \nWorking professionally as a 14-year-old was not without its difficulties. “From the beginning of my animation career, my mum made me promise to focus on school work before animating,” he explains. Spence tries to get homework done at the start of the week and use weekends and school holidays for animating. While he is working on a project he will spend two to three hours animating and editing most evenings. \nHis favourite commission to date is a wedding proposal video . A man called Ben got in touch with Spence and explained that he had a plan to propose to his girlfriend Kirsten in his local cinema – he asked if Spence could render the couple in lego and make a video charting how they met and some of their relationship highlights. At the end, a lego Ben popped the question – and real-life Kirsten said yes. \n“It was a very quirky project and different to anything in the past – it was a very personal thing and I loved making it for Ben,” Spence says. His inbox now gets filled with requests for wedding proposal videos. \nHe says the hardest aspect of the job is bringing a client’s vision to life, based on their notes and ideas. “In a live action film the employer would be on set and watch it unfold – with my animations they have to wait to see the final product.” \nTaking criticism has also been a learning curve, says the animator. “It took me time to get used to taking criticism on board and learning from it. If a team come back to me and ask to change a scene or edit a figure out it means completely reshooting the animation.” Morgan Spence.

It can be painstaking work, especially when managing the things alone – from writing, building the sets, animating and editing. \nBeing resourceful and proactive has also been an asset. When working on the Oakenfold music video, a Glasgow film event brought Disney Pixar director Mark Andrews to town. Spence made sure to approach him for advice. Andrews, who directed Brave, gave the young film-maker feedback on his work and technical pointers. The director also emphasised the importance of working in a team. \nAs a young entrepreneur, Spence has learned that meeting deadlines and sound communication are also key to establishing trust. He also makes sure he gets references from previous employers and posts their testimonials on his website. \nDoes Spence have any advice for other young entrepreneurs who want to be taken seriously? “Being among teams of adults in a professional environment can be intimidating, but if you’re in that situation then you are there on merit; you have a talent, so believe in it.” \nSign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:49:00.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
