Former U.S. officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling is not duplicated in future U.S. or European elections and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators.\nU.S. allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials — and others close to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin — and Trump’s associates, according to three former U.S. officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence. Separately, U.S. intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump’s associates.\nThe disclosures about the contacts came as new questions were raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ ties to the Russians. According to a former senior U.S. official, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, twice in the past year. The details of the meetings were not clear, but the contact appeared to contradict testimony Sessions provided Congress during his confirmation hearing in January when he said he “did not have communications with the Russians.”\nAndrew Harnik / Associated Press Jeff Sessions is sworn in prior to testifying at his confirmation in January. Related U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not reveal that he spoke twice with Russian ambassador in 2016 Sessions said in a statement late Wednesday that he “never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.”\n“I have no idea what this allegation is about,” he said. “It is false.”\nTrump has denied that his campaign had any contact with Russian officials, and at one point he openly suggested that U.S. spy agencies had cooked up intelligence suggesting that the Russian government had tried to meddle in the presidential election. Trump has accused the Obama administration of hyping the Russia storyline as a way to discredit his new administration.\nAt the Obama White House, Trump’s statements stoked fears among some that intelligence could be covered up or destroyed — or its sources exposed — once power changed hands. What followed was a push to preserve the intelligence that underscored the deep anxiety with which the White House and U.S. intelligence agencies had come to view the threat from Moscow.\nIt also reflected the suspicion among many in the Obama White House that the Trump campaign might have colluded with Russia on election email hacks — a suspicion that U.S. officials say has not been confirmed. Former senior Obama administration officials said that none of the efforts were directed by then-President Barack Obama.\nAlex Wong/Getty Images White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer participates in a White House daily press briefing at the James Brady Press Briefing Room February 14, 2017 at the White House Sean Spicer, the Trump White House spokesman, said, “The only new piece of information that has come to light is that political appointees in the Obama administration have sought to create a false narrative to make an excuse for their own defeat in the election.” He added, “There continues to be no there, there.”\nAs Inauguration Day approached, Obama White House officials grew convinced that the intelligence was damning and that they needed to ensure that as many people as possible inside government could see it, even if people without security clearances could not. Some officials began asking specific questions at intelligence briefings, knowing the answers would be archived and could be easily unearthed by investigators — including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which in early January announced an inquiry into Russian efforts to influence the election.\nAt intelligence agencies, there was a push to process as much raw intelligence as possible into analyses and to keep the reports at a low classification level to ensure as wide a readership as possible across the government — and, in some cases, among European allies. This allowed the upload of as much intelligence as possible to Intellipedia, a secret wiki used by U.S. intelligence analysts to share information.\nThere was also an effort to pass reports and other sensitive materials to Congress. In one instance, the State Department sent a cache of documents marked “secret” to Sen. Benjamin Cardin of Maryland days before the Jan. 20 inauguration. The documents, detailing Russian efforts to intervene in elections worldwide, were sent in response to a request from Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and were shared with Republicans on the panel.\nYURI KOCHETKOV/AFP/Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a press conference after a meeting with Uruguayan President, in Moscow, on February 16, 2017. Tabare Vazquez arrived in Moscow on an official visit. “This situation was serious, as is evident by President Obama’s call for a review — and as is evident by the United States response,” said Eric Schultz, an Obama spokesman. “When the intelligence community does that type of comprehensive review, it is standard practice that a significant amount of information would be compiled and documented.”\nThe opposite happened with the most sensitive intelligence, including the names of sources and the identities of foreigners who were regularly monitored. Officials tightened the already small number of people who could access that information. They knew the information could not be kept from the new president or his top advisers but wanted to narrow the number of people who might see the information, officials said.\nMore than a half-dozen current and former officials described various aspects of the effort to preserve and distribute the intelligence, and some said they were speaking to draw attention to the material and ensure proper investigation by Congress. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information, nearly all of which remains secret, making an independent public assessment of the competing Obama and Trump administration claims impossible.\nThe FBI is conducting a wide-ranging counterintelligence investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and is examining alleged links between Trump’s associates and the Russian government.\nSeparately, the House and Senate intelligence committees are conducting their own investigations, although they must rely on information collected by the FBI and intelligence agencies.\nAP Photo/J.

Dan Coats, Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that “I think it’s our responsibility to provide you access to all that you need.”\nSome Obama White House officials had little faith that a Trump administration would make good on such pledges, and the efforts to preserve the intelligence continued until the administration’s final hours. This was partly because intelligence was still being collected and analyzed, but it also reflected the sentiment among many administration officials that they had not recognized the scale of the Russian campaign until it was too late.\nThe warning signs had been building throughout the summer but were far from clear. As WikiLeaks was pushing out emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee through online publication, U.S. intelligence began picking up conversations in which Russian officials were discussing contacts with Trump associates, and European allies were starting to pass along information about people close to Trump meeting with Russians in the Netherlands, Britain and other countries.\nBut what was going on in the meetings was unclear to the officials, and the intercepted communications did little to clarify matters — the Russians, it appeared, were arguing about how far to go in interfering in the presidential election.\nWhat intensified the alarm at the Obama White House was a campaign of cyberattacks on state electoral systems in September, which led the Obama administration to deliver a public accusation against the Russians in October.\nBut it was not until after the election, and after more intelligence had come in, that the administration began to grasp the scope of the suspected tampering and concluded that one goal of the campaign had been to help tip the election in Trump’s favor. In early December, Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full assessment of the Russian campaign.\nIn the weeks before the assessment was released in January, the intelligence community combed through databases for an array of communications and other information — some of which was months old by then — and began producing reports that showed there were contacts during the campaign between Trump associates and Russian officials.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T16:33:22.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
