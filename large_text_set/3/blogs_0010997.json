The images do not include nudity, but they have appeared online without her permission, a spokesperson for Watson told TIME in a statement.\n“Photos from a clothes fitting Emma had with a stylist a couple of years ago have been stolen,” her publicist explained in an e-mail to TIME. “They are not nude photographs. Lawyers have been instructed and we are not commenting further.”\nWatson has been in the spotlight recently promoting the live-action remake of the 1991 animated Disney musical. A UN Women Goodwill Ambassador since 2014, Watson also works as an advocate, participating in events like International Women’s Day , running a global feminist book club and frequently discussing her identity as a feminist. \nWatson was threatened with a leak of nude photos in 2014 after giving a speech on gender equality. She later said that she knew the threat was a hoax because the photos did not exist and tweeted her disappointment with both the violation and the “lack of empathy” surrounding it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T21:36:13.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
