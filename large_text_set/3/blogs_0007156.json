McKenzie scores Chiefs corker 0:43 \n2) If the match of the weekend was in Dunedin, the cameo came from Hamilton where Damian McKenzie was again extravagant with his stunning array of flicks and offloads against the Blues. There’s not much of him but he packs a big old metaphorical punch. \nThe same can be said for Nehe Milner-Skudder who notched up a hat-trick against a pretty dire set of Rebels. \nThrow Aaron Smith into the equation and all the talk that rugby is now a big man’s game comes across as small and stupid talk. \n3) Less kaleidoscopic but impressive nevertheless were Leinster. \nThe Scarlets, having won in Limerick a week earlier, were put firmly in their place by a Leinster team that look increasingly like the favourites for the PRO12 league. \nThey have strength in depth to go with the stellar cast of regular Irish internationals. \nIt appears that the home semi-finalists will be two from them, Munster and Ospreys, with the Scarlets and Ulster battling for the fourth spot. Beale double beats Bath 0:33 \n4) Late Saturday night, having diligently studied some Cheltenham form, I eased into a bottle of Pomerol to watch Bath and Wasps — well, that should just read Wasps. \nBath are struggling without key men like their halfbacks and Francois Louw, but frankly I don’t think a full-strength Bath team would have got near them. \nSome of the Wasps handling is quite superb. \nDanny Cipriani is having a ball with players like Kurtley Beale outside him. \nAnd to think, Willie le Roux is only just settling in. \nIt’s going to be some quarter-final in Dublin... in fact it’s going to be some weekend of European knockout rugby. \n5) In contrast to the ultra-expansive style of the New Zealand franchises, Exeter are slowly narrowing their game from their distant early attacking days. \nThat’s not to say there isn’t the odd threat in the backs but this team is becoming more and more dependent on its tight driving game. \nThe authorities’ law change to make the catch-and-drive more difficult is having no impact on this well-drilled and tightly-knit team. \nRob Baxter’s boys gave the Tigers a bashing, but will it suffice against the best? \nAs Wasps expand, Exeter contract; all very interesting.

Barba's debut excites Kearns \n9) I wonder, do Italy have another trick up their sleeve? \nOne assumes France will have studied the Twickenham tapes and be prepared for no-ruck Italy. \nIt was a once-in-a-lifetime ploy to utilise it as much as they did, maybe it’ll be used now and then, pinching a penalty, confusing the opposition. \nItaly will have some confidence restored after Twickenham but France is showing signs of a revival — in terms of performance standards, if not results. \nThey will be looking to put on a show. \n10) Good to hear the playoff for promotion to the Premiership has been scrapped. \nThe playoff system works in the Premiership where international clashes deprive top teams of talent. \nPlayoff can balance the loss of internationals — as is the case with Saracens. \nIt is a bad idea in the Championship. \nThe leap from one league to another is immense. \nThe best team is the one that picks up the most points. \nWithout the potential pitfall of the playoff losses as mastered by Bristol, teams can plan and purchase their buying strategy earlier in the season to give them the greatest possible chance of making a fist in what is always an uneven fight against relegation. \nThat, I suppose, is the good news for Bristol.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:58:28.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
