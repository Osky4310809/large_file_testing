Mike Huckabee noted Monday that President Donald Trump is now being criticized after having proved his critics wrong. \nHuckabee waded into the controversy that erupted after Trump sidestepped the chance to condemn Russian leader Vladimir Putin during an interview with Bill O’Reilly of Fox News that aired Sunday. \n“ Putin’s a killer ,” O’Reilly said during the interview. Advertisement - story continues below \n“There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers. What do you think — our country’s so innocent. You think our country’s so innocent?” Trump said in response. \nHe added, “A lot of killers around, believe me.” \nThose comments were interpreted as Trump’s support for Putin.

I’m not going to critique every utterance of the president. I obviously don’t see the issue the same way he does,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

No pretense , no phoniness. What you see is what you get,” Huckabee said. \n“Whatever Donald Trump says as president, somebody is not going to like it, but a lot of American people do,” he added.
