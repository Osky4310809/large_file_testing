There is no price too high to pay for social and political stability in any state”. \nAn octogenarian retiree from the local government system, Ejindu Onuoha said the NULGE President did not mean well for the state, saying: ”Instead of pleading for the payment of pension arrears of retired council workers who are dying, he is advocating for crooks who have duped the government and should be facing the law.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:35:56.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
