On a police video, Kimmel can be seen choking and punching Brooks, using his forearms, hands and knees. \nOfficer Dan Verno apparently hears the commotion, enters the room and pulls Brooks away from Kimmel, who then proceeds to use a Taser on Brooks. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \nAttorney Todd Hollis, representing Brooks, told KDKA-TV’s Ralph Iannotti, “The video is repulsive. It represents everything that’s bad in a police officer and it goes against everything most good cops stand for.” \nAfter the altercation in the police station, the officers filed more than 30 charges against Brooks, including assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest. \nAll the charges but one, drug possession, were dropped by the Commonwealth. Brooks pleaded guilty to the possession charge and was sentenced to probation. \nHollis said Brooks was upset and fearful of retaliation, but he wanted to go forward with the lawsuit. \nHollis said they are seeking to have a jury trial in the case. KDKA reached out to the Elizabeth Borough Police Department for reaction to the lawsuit, but no one responded to our inquiry.
