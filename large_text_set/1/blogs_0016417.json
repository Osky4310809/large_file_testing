The likes of Steve Harvey , Kanye West and former Baltimore Ravens player Ray Lewis have all been spotted at Trump Tower. They each told reporters why they were there – to discuss policy matters important to them. In other words, they are ready to make a difference no matter if the president is Republican or Democrat. \nThat doesn’t matter to some pundits. Because these celebrities and athletes met with Trump, they are “mediocre negroes,” according to CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill. \n“Yeah, it’s a bunch of mediocre negroes being dragged in front of TV as a photo-op for Donald Trump’s exploitive campaign against black people,” Hill said on CNN on Monday. \nHarvey, West, and Lewis are being used by the president-elect for photo ops, Hill insisted. The president-elect is too cowardly, he surmised, to invite actual policy experts to Trump Tower. \nThese are some pretty heavy accusations. \nHow about we accuse these men of having minds of their own? \nMartin Luther King III met with Trump on Monday. Is he \"mediocre\" too?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:39:25.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
