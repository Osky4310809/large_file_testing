The pregnant star took the stage at the Women's March in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday to deliver a moving speech about equality, thanking President Donald Trump \"from the bottom of both hearts beating inside my miraculous female body\" for starting \"the revolution.\" WATCH: Katy Perry, Drew Barrymore, Charlize Theron, Ariana Grande and More Attend Women's Marches Across the Nation \"We need to take inspiration from nature, and remember that we hold the mystery of life, and the seed of every possibility within our bodies,\" Portman said. \"We need to demand freedom from fear over our bodies and control over our own bodies.\" \"In order to effectively do so, we must seek leadership positions, and support other women who do the same. Until we make it normal to have at least half, if not more, of our leaders be female, we will be serving, and with our taxes financing, a government that believes it's within their domain to make decisions for our future,\" she continued. \"Thank you all for being here, and for showing our power to the world, and thank you to the wonderful men, who show us that women also have many champions and compadres. Now, from the bottom of both hearts beating inside my miraculous female body, I want to thank our new president. You just started the revolution,\" she concluded her speech, powerfully raising her microphone in the air.
