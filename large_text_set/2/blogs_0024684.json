Thirteen. Straight. \nWith that, Kansas tied the UCLA's record of 13 straight conference titles under John Wooden, Gene Bartow and Gary Cunningham from 1967 to 1979. Kansas incredibly has done it all under one coach: Bill Self. \nThe last time Kansas didn't win the Big 12, it was 2004. We lived in a different world. Let's take a look at the craziest facts from Kansas' record streak. \n13. George W. Bush was president the last time Kansas didn't win the Big 12. \nKansas' streak has seen three U.S. presidents: Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. \n12.

In 2004, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King won the Oscar for Best Picture. \nIf you start the movie now, you can finish it just in time for Kansas' 14th straight Big 12 title. \n7. Tom Brady had only won 2 Super Bowl titles the last time Kansas didn't win the Big 12. \nDeflategate wasn't even a thing. \n6.
