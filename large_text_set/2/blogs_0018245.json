Case in point: TMZ reports that all three members of the group brutally beat up the mid-’00s pop star Sean Kingston in Las Vegas yesterday. \nAccording to TMZ, Kingston and the Migos had been arguing over Soulja Boy. Kingston is friends with Soulja, and he’s been feuding with the Migos lately, claiming that he has Quavo’s chain and aiming a recent song called “ Beef ” at the group. TMZ says that, during a confrontation at the Sands Expo and Convention Center yesterday, the three members of Migos kicked Kingston and stepped on his head. Someone in Kingston’s entourage fired a gun once, but it didn’t hit anyone. \nVegas police detained the shooter, but Kingston and the Migos left the scene before cops arrived. Later, police pulled Kingston over at a traffic stop, and while he was “semi-cooperative,” he wouldn’t identify his attackers. Police would like to speak to Migos, but they’ve also pointed out that the members of the group are not “wanted.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:57:16.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
