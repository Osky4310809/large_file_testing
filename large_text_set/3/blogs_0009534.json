Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump because of misogyny, racism, sexism, the FBI, the Russians, and now the media. Seriously, the media that was banking heavily on her to beat Trump was part of the problem, says House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Reportedly, the Clinton campaign is angrier with the Obama White House than Russia or FBI Director James Comey concerning the interference campaign that the Kremlin waged against the former first lady, which was primarily done through state-funded media apparatuses peddling propaganda and social media trolls. That is not the same thing as a hack. Moreover, Facebook said it didn’t sway the election. The Economist also wrote how fake news didn’t play a pivotal role . \nNevertheless, Pelosi thinks that the media played a role in undermining the election because they reported on Hillary Clinton’s unauthorized and unsecure email server that remained a story because every explanation turned out to be a lie , fueling speculation as to what else she was hiding, and rehashing the old 1990s criticisms of the power couple. Oh, and because the server wasn’t secure, it could have been a national security risk. She could have mishandled classified information—and the FBI launched a criminal investigation. She was a presidential candidate, Nancy. This is news (via Real Clear Politics ) [emphasis mine]: JAKE TAPPER, 'STATE OF THE UNION' HOST: OK. \nHillary Clinton's inner circle is not happy with the way President Obama handled news about Russia's election hacking. They think he was being too cautious, President Obama. And one of Clinton's advisers told \"The New Yorker\" -- quote -- \"What if Barack Obama had gone to the Oval Office or the East Room of the White House and said, I'm speaking to you tonight to inform you that the United States is under attack; the Russian government, at the highest levels, is trying to influence our most precious asset, our democracy, and I'm not going to let it happen?\" \nThe Clinton aide went on to say, \"A large majority of Americans would have sat up and taken notice.\" \nDo you think, in retrospect, that President Obama handled this the right way? \nREP. PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Well, I think that President Obama handled it as he received information of that -- of the highest confidence. \nI do think, with all due respect in the world for the press, that the press could have done a better job, instead of printing every e-mail that came out , and saying this comes to you from Vladimir Putin, they were, hah, hah, hah, John Podesta said this or that. \nI think the press were accomplices in the undermining of our election by the Russians by not pointing out this stuff is worthless because it comes from an undermining of our election , or at least reminding the public where this -- these e-mails, the leaking of these e-mails came from. \nSo, I can't speak to the timing of what President Obama said. I wish he -- it had all happened in a time where the public could know that this had an impact on the election. A lot of things have an impact on the election. This certainly was one of them. \nBut what's important to note is that it doesn't happen again, and that people in other countries are -- realize what they are going to be susceptible to when the Russians come in to undermine their elections. \nNo matter how much you whine, Trump is president; Clinton is not. He won, she lost. Get over it. Also, she didn’t keep electronic copies of her emails, she deleted 30,000 of them, and this was all avoidable if she had followed the 2009 National Archives and Records Administration regulations concerning electronic communications. She didn’t because Hillary thinks she can play by a different set of rules. That was another problem as well. It all points to the fact that Democrats can’t accept that it was Hillary who undermined her whole campaign with this private email system and the lies that followed to explain why it was established.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:11:20.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
