That’s why it was easy for them to repeal Obamacare.” \n“But when it came to replacing it, when it came to building a coalition to actually do something proactive and positive for the country, there’s no consensus in the Republican party,” Earnest said. \nHis overall observation, based on this first major legislative outing under the new administration and Republican Congress, is that “the Democrats in Congress are holding a much stronger hand than it looked like they were holding 65 days ago.” \nTrump places some of the blame for the American Health Care Act’s failure at the feet the House Freedom Caucus and conservative interest groups like Heritage Action and Club for Growth; however, both he and Vice President Mike Pence sounded an optimistic tone that Obamacare will ultimately be replaced. ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017 \nAt an event in West Virginia on Saturday, Pence said , “Congress just wasn’t ready.” \nHe stated the failure of Republicans to agree on a repeal-and-replace plan was a “victory of the status quo in Washington, D.C. and a victory for Obamacare. I promise you that victory won’t last very long.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
