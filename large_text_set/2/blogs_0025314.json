Jonny Morris issued an apology after performing the Nazi salute Credit: SWNS \nH e said: \"I think the council's monitoring officer will doubtless wish to investigate further - there are potentially serious consequences here. \n\"Although Cllr Morris apologised for his behaviour in my opinion this constitutes hate crime, which is totally unacceptable.\" \nHe added: \"I cannot ever recall such an uncontrolled outburst in the council chamber. \n\"It besmirches the reputation of public office.\" \nTudor Evans, leader of the Plymouth Labour group confirmed that Cllr Morris had been suspended while the matter was investigated. \nHe said: \"The whips are now looking into the matter. \n\"Obviously we take this very seriously.\" Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:20:55.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
