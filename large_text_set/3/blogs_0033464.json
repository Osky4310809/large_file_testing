Capuano's remarks on the House Floor on March 28, 2017, about efforts to roll back internet privacy protections. \"Give me one good reason why Comcast should know what my mother's medical problems are?\" \"Just last week I bought underwear on the internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color? Or any of that information?\" \"These companies are not going broke. The internet is not in jeopardy. I don't get this. When I was growing up, I thought one of the tenets of the Republican Party that I admired the most was privacy. It is mine. Not yours. Not the government. Mine. You can't have it unless I give it to you.\" \"Make one good argument... not two, one good reason why all these people watching would want Comcast or Verizon to have information unless we give it to them,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T09:26:44.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
