The Football Whispers Index takes the latest transfer rumours and gives them a score out of five; the higher the score, the more realistic and reliable the whisper. \nHere are today's top five emerging whispers for the summer. And keep an eye on Transfer Talk for all the latest gossip. \nKalidou Koulibaly to Chelsea \nChelsea boss Antonio Conte is set to raid Serie A this summer with Napoli centre-back Koulibaly in his sights. The Sun claim the 25-year-old tops the list of potential John Terry replacements and the report goes on to suggest £50 million would be enough to convince the Serie A club to part ways with their star defender. \nDavy Klaassen to Everton \nAjax attacking midfielder Klaassen is the latest Dutch player to be linked with a move to Everton. Roma's Kevin Strootman and Memphis Depay were linked with moves to Goodison in January but nothing materialised. According to The Mirror, Ronald Koeman is keen on his 24-year-old compatriot. The versatile midfielder is out of contract in 2019 and the Eredivisie giants may be forced to cash in this summer if they want to get the going rate for a player of his quality. \nMauro Icardi to Atletico Madrid \nInter Milan striker Icardi is being lined up by Atletico Madrid as a potential replacement for long-term Manchester United target Antoine Griezmann. The 24-year-old has scored 16 goals in Serie A this season and according to Marca, Diego Simeone wants the Argentine to lead the club into a new era should their talismanic striker depart in the summer. \nAndre Gray to Newcastle United \nBurnley striker Gray looks set to leave Turf Moor this summer with negotiations over a new deal yet to progress. The 25-year-old's current deal expires in 2018 and Crystal Palace and Southampton are reportedly interested, but the Mirror believe Championship leaders Newcastle are leading the race. \nLayvin Kurzawa to Arsenal \nItalian news outlet Sport Mediaset claim Arsenal have made Paris Saint-Germain left-back Kurzawa their prime target ahead of the summer window. The Gunners currently have Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs vying for a start in the full-back role but neither are excelling. The report goes on to suggest £17m would be enough to land the Frenchman.
