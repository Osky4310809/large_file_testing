They teach us how to keep our own pets healthy and happy, raise awareness for animals in need and even have a fun giveaway every now and again. Most important, let's not forget they're usually filled with photos of squishy little faces that instantly have us talking in our high-pitched baby voices. \nIn no particular order, these are the pet blogs we're totally addicted to right meow. 1. Puppy Leaks Image: Puppy Leaks/Twitter \nJen of Puppy Leaks is no joke when it comes to providing nifty tips for dog owners. From science and research to training tips and back to well-written opinion articles, there's something for everyone on this blog. And Jen even has a super-helpful drop-down topics menu, so you don't have to waste time skimming the blog for what you're looking for. \nGet started with some of Puppy Leaks' most popular posts: A photo posted by Tamar Arslanian (@ihavecat) on Dec 11, 2016 at 10:59am PST \nBlogger Tamar is single, over 30 and has multiple cats — but she DGAF because she's freaking fabulous . Tamar began the blog as a way to chronicle her life in NYC with her kitties, and it's become her mission to dismantle the crazy cat lady stereotype. Obviously, I Have Cat is filled with humor, but the blog is also chock-full of sensible insight ( like why it's not such a good idea to give cats as presents ) and functional tips ( like where to find stylish cat furniture ). \nShe even has a book now titled Shop Cats of New York , which features gorgeous photos of New York's iconic felines and the stories behind them. 3. Goats of Anarchy A photo posted by Goats of Anarchy (@goatsofanarchy) on Jan 5, 2017 at 6:06am PST \nLeanne of Goats of Anarchy doesn't have a traditional blog per se, but that's because she's way too busy rescuing baby goats with special needs. Her Instagram account is definitely a microblog, however, and we dare you not to fall in love with her menagerie of goats. A photo posted by Goats of Anarchy (@goatsofanarchy) on Nov 26, 2016 at 8:36am PST \nEvery day GOA educates us on the ups and downs of animal rescue and opens our eyes to just how cruel the world can be to our furry little friends. But believe us when we say there's plenty of fun to be had with GOA too. The goats frequently wear onesies, sweaters and a duck costume — and these babies are so well taken care of that they happily (and hilariously) bounce all over their little goat kingdom. \nYou can learn more about GOA's mission and where to donate here . 4. Rancho Relaxo A photo posted by Caitlin Cimini (@boochaces) on Jan 4, 2017 at 10:16am PST \nLike Goats of Anarchy, Rancho Relaxo isn't a traditional blog, but their Instagram serves as a microblog about animal rescue (Caitlin of Rancho Relaxo is even friends with Leanne of GOA in real life!). \nRancho Relaxo rescues pretty much all types of farm animals, including goats, lambs, chickens, pigs and kittens — they even have a mini-horse and mini-donkey in their care. But we'll issue a big warning here: You'll experience a roller coaster of emotions while following Rancho Relaxo's journey. Caitlin is blessed with the gift of beaming her spirit directly through the computer screen, and you'll feel all of her highs and lows along with her as she feverishly works to make the world a better place, one animal at a time. She also was probably a creative director in a former life, because her carefully curated brand sucks you in and won't let you go.

A photo posted by YouDidWhatWithYourWiener.com (@youdidwhatwithyourwiener) on Jun 13, 2016 at 4:15pm PDT \nOK, this one is a big win for the hilarious name alone — but the added bonus is that the blog is full of useful information about dogs and specializes in tips about adventuring with your best friend on hiking and road trips. Blogger Jessica aims to lift the veil on dangerous stereotypes about dogs, and she also provides tons of photos of her adorable dachshunds enjoying their lives in the great outdoors (hence the clever blog name).
