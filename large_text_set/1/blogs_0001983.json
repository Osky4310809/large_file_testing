Police arrived to find four victims on the scene, two fatally wounded. A video posted by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Dec 30, 2016 at 9:13pm PST \nNBC Connecticut reported that state police have shut down the parking lot of the Oakdale Theatre, and released the name of one of the deceased — Travis Ward, 31, from New Haven. All shooting victims were male. \nA cousin of Ward’s said of her late relative: “Travis was not into the streets at all. He’s not a street kid, and he’s not a kid, he’s a man. He was coming out with his family to celebrate his birthday.” \nLocal news further reported that the police are yet to apprehend any suspects in the shooting and they are investigating a hit-and-run that occurred in the parking lot to see if the incidents are related. \nMeek Mill has yet to make a public comment on the shooting at the time of publication.
