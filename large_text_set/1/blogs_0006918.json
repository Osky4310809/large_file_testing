Tube strike: Almost all Zone 1 stations will be closed (Alex Lentati) \nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan , described the strike as “unnecessary” and urged unions to “call it off immediately”. \nHe said: \"A lot of progress has been made and there is a good deal on the table. I strongly urge the unions to call off this strike which will cause misery and disruption to millions of Londoners. \n\"I have instructed TfL to work around the clock throughout the weekend to continue negotiating to resolve this dispute. There is no reason for the unions to strike. 24-hour Tube strike: All you need to know - January 8 2017 \n\"I can assure Londoners that we will continue to do everything we can to avert this strike.\" \nThe walkout — and the threat of more to come — is in protest at 800 job cuts and the closure of ticket offices under former mayor Boris Johnson’s regime as a cash-saving measure. \nUnions members are angry with Mayor Khan for not reopening at least some central London ticket offices. Tube strike: The 24-hour strike will begin on Sunday evening (Rex) \nSteve Griffiths, chief operating officer for London Underground, said: \"There is no need to strike. We had always intended to review staffing levels and have had constructive discussions with the unions. \n“We agree that we need more staff in our stations and have already started to recruit 150 extra staff. Everything you need to know about the forthcoming Tube strike \n\"This number is bound to increase as we work through the other areas that need to be addressed. Taking into account existing vacancies and natural turnover this means that around 500 staff will be recruited for stations this year. There will also be increased opportunities for promotion. \n\"All of this will ensure that our customers feel safe, fully supported and able to access the right assistance in our stations at all times. We encourage the unions to continue working with us on this process and we are available for talks at all times through the weekend in order to resolve this dispute.\" \nTfL said it will try to run as many services as possible, but travellers are advised to complete their journeys by 6pm on Sunday. \nNational Rail services will not be affected by the strike but there will be no underground services from busy interchange stations such as Victoria, King's Cross, Waterloo, Paddington, Euston, Bank and London Bridge. \nPiccadilly line services will still run between Hammersmith and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 3, but there will be no service to Terminals 4 or 5. \nThere will be no service on the Victoria or Waterloo & City lines, and all other lines will be severely affected with limited services in outer London.
