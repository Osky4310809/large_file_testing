It is my responsibility to provide for Imo people who surrendered their right of vote to me as their governor. This is what I am dramatizing today. \n“This is not the first time we are embarking on empowerment programme, we donated 500 million to the Niger Delta Women and Youths as part of our empowerment programme not long ago amongst other empowerments. \n“One of the greatest empowerment I have offered to Imo people is the free education which has enabled our women save money which would have been used for School fees. \n“I have said this to Imo people, you are aware that the song going on in the country is the music of recession, but I have refused to sing this song of recession and I have continued to say that there is no recession in Imo State. \n“The song of poverty shall never be sang in Imo State. Hence, you are seeing work going on around the State day and night and we are equally embarking on empowerments when other States are crying of lack of funds. \n“Also traditional rulers will serve as guarantors to the women to ensure that the right people get the loan and he also encouraged the women to make good use of the money as the fund, if put into good use can change their lives for good.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T15:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:20:52.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
