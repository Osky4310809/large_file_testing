If you're going to run on the field, make sure you've got @EzekielElliott on your side. #ProBowl pic.twitter.com/ggcMfoe77w \n— Amber Derrow (@amberderrow) January 30, 2017 Fortunately, it appears nobody got too upset or injured during the incident. And actually, it looks like some of the players had some fun with the kid.\nHere we have an enormous defender pretending like he was going to bodyslam the dude. Maybe they were watching the Royal Rumble on the AFC sideline. I don’t know.\n. @EzekielElliott doubling as a security guard tonight at #probowl #ProBowl2017 #nfc #nfl #streaker pic.twitter.com/stFpoXiBol \n— Loren Elliott (@Lelliottphoto) January 30, 2017 As the fan ran towards the end zone, Ezekiel Elliott ‘raced’ him to the end zone. Clearly, he needs to eat more, like Zeke.\nThe fan eventually scored a touchdown, and what do you do when you score a touchdown wearing a Superman shirt? That’s right, you do the Cam Newton ripping your shirt open to let the world know how badass you are.\nFinally, we have security catching the fan, and your friendly Ezekiel Elliott making sure the kid didn’t get away or that the security didn’t take it too hard on the fan. Hard to tell.\nAnyways, it’s all fun and games until some Batman looking security comes outta nowhere and takes down your fake Superman self.\nSo don’t do this kids because it could’ve ended much, much worse for this dude.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T06:41:30.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
