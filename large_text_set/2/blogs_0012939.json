Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA series of nude photos from the 19th century have been removed from an art gallery after outraged visitors said they were \"disgusting and obscene.\" \nThe Victorian art , depicting nude and partially clothed women, received complaints after being put on display as part of a Valentine's Day \"Romance\" exhibition. \nBut the photos were spotted by three women, aged between 60 and 80, who were outraged by the works, describing them as 'obscene and bordered on pornographic.' \nThey demanded the six offending photos be withdrawn from The Cube Gallery, within the South Downs Heritage Centre in Hassocks, West Sussex. \nThe women had not visited to view the exhibition, but saw the works while walking around the centre's garden centre and cafe.

After an overwhelming show of public support, the couple decided to reinstate the pieces - with a warning to visitors (Photo: Caters) \nThe photographs were displayed alongside work by local sculptors and artists, as well as works by Sir William Russell Flint and John Yardley. \nExhibition organiser Martin Nee, said: \"The work was given to us by a local art collector. \n\"Before 1839, depictions of nudity generally consisted of paintings, drawings and engravings. \n\"Artists then began to use new photography techniques and technology as a new and exciting way to depict the nude form. \n\"The history of this art form is probably more interesting than the work itself to a lot of people. \n\"Obviously, it was not intended to cause offence.\" \nThe free \"Romance\" exhibition has pulled together photos, paintings and postcards from various collections and is within the South Downs Heritage Centre.
