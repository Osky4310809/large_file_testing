Federal Minimum wage? The fuck? Come on... find some nuance to make a real argument. How about the median wage? At least. Maybe the median wage for each state. \nI agree, they should not be able to vote on their own benefits. We should have term limits as well. \nAs far as giving them the federal minimum wage... I understand the rationale but it's nonsensical. The federal minimum wage is intended to maintain itself across the nation. Not just major cities. They don't live normal lives and pay for most things out of pocket. It makes zero sense. \nYou talk about influence in politics... but that has absolutely nothing to do with their salary. Limit their other sources if income if anything. \nHonestly, your argument just comes off as petty and vindictive. I get it. Fuck them, they should live with the same options they provide the worst off of their constituents. But, they also write bills for the middle class and infrastructure... I mean... not lately, but... you are talking about changing the system so I think it's fair to apply your payment plan to any and all congresses. Not just this particularly poor congress. But... idk man. It feels like you are mad and that hatred on your part blinding the fuck outta your critical thinking. \nAlso... you say it's the highest honor. Uh, sure. But that pay is an incentive to pull people away from the private sector and does terrible now. Nobody will take a seat in the house for minimum wage. That's... fkn insane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T08:45:34.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
