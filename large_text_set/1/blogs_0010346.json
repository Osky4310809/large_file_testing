Her proud family put a photo of the 8-pointer (cleaned up, no blood to offend anyone) on a sweatshirt. Domonique proudly wore it to school the next day. \nThe sweatshirt made a few students uncomfortable, and Domonique was required to remove it after being told by her teacher, “Killing animals is not what we do,” according to The Medina Gazette . \nAhem. I’m a Midwesterner. We schedule school holidays and city council meetings around deer hunting season. We also produce most of the pork and nearly half the beef in the United States. To put it bluntly, killing animals is most definitely what we do.   \nTo belittle and humiliate a child for following an absolutely accepted community standard is cruel. To kowtow to a few overly sensitive kids, who almost certainly have been exposed to the hunting culture their entire lives, is unacceptable. \nSeriously, folks, we have got to get over ourselves and backpedal this culture of constant offense. \nHow would this have played out if a child wore a religious head-covering to school and was told to remove it? \nComing home in tears, Domonique threw the sweatshirt in the trash. Her mother contacted both the teacher and the superintendent of schools, who denied wrongdoing but apologized for any misunderstanding.
