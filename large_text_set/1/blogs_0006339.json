It has an extensive coastline and has a number of mountainous areas, most notably Snowdon or Yr Wyddfa. One of the proudest Welsh achievements is the spreading of their language into absolutely every part of life in Wales, although the only obvious impact that the language has had upon modern Wales is that it prompts motorists to drive more slowly in order to accommodate the additional time required to read the road signs; a procedure that normally involves reading the Welsh, failing to understand it in any way and immediately searching for the English translation, all while still behind the wheel. \nWales established itself as a country shortly after the departure of the Romans in the 5th century - before then it was proudly known as \"Britannia\" and the language called \"British\" (effectively a giant middle finger to Scotland ). On their departure the Romans took a number of things with them; plumbing, infrastructure and almost all of the vowels. Strict vowel rationing has been in force in Wales ever since, with amusing names like \"Llywelyn ap Gruffudd\" displaying the most vowels one is ever likely to see in one place. \nThe country is often described as having a great deal of \"cultural identity\" and it is difficult to argue that this is not the case. It is much easier to argue that in this case the phrase cultural identity is a euphemism for \" sheep \" and \" rain \" which Wales has in abundance all year round. The Welsh have worked hard to establish themselves as a nation of song, there being very little else to do whilst travelling around Aberystwyth, apart from consuming copious amounts of cider and tobacco , which roughen the throat to allow proper Welsh language conversation. In south Wales, however, where Welsh is not spoken as much, Bacardi and Coke is consumed instead. The country also boasts a Rugby Union team of sorts, and while supporting the Rugby team is not compulsory, almost everybody does as supporting the football team is quite a depressing experience - for there is no team to support, only one man named Gareth Bale who doesn't even play in Wales. \nThere is an area in Wales known as \"north Wales\", which England forgot about while invading and as a result is the only area in the country to actually speak Welsh. However, England still does not acknowledge their existence and despite attempts to get people to pay attention to them, nobody outside of Anglesey, Gwynedd or Conwy actually acknowledges north Wales. This might also have something to do with the fact many southern Welsh people can't actually point north, as their schools don't teach them directions. Contents edit History Flag painted on a wall in Wales as a sign of friendship with the English. \nWales has been inhabited by humans for some 29,000 years, which just goes to show that it was once a lovely place to live. Wales was once a small collection of about 18 smaller states, each with their own dialect, farming methods and tolerance towards the other states. Wars between the smaller states eventually led to a successful victory for the states of Dadlau and Rhyfel [1] . That is until war broke out again and the in-fighting continued and would probably still be going to this day had the Romans not arrived in AD 48. edit The Roman Conquest and beyond \nThe fear of conquest that rushed through the Welsh heartland when the Romans invaded Britain encouraged them to stop fighting each other over the correct spelling of the word \"Peace\" [2] . Thirty years of fighting followed, this mostly involved running down steep hills in loincloths and then running back up them again, a strategy the Romans evidently found quite vexing as it took them 30 years to subjugate the most \"spirited\" tribes; the Silures and the Ordovices. The Welsh retreated onto Ynys Mon, a previously ignored wasteland which, for the first and last time, became important and noteworthy for a brief while, so at least the geography was the real winner. \nRoman rule in Wales lasted over 300 years, evidently the Romans saw something in Wales that modern tourists consistently fail to see, perhaps it didn't rain quite so much. \nThe departure of the Romans in 540 AD threw Wales into turmoil, having spent several centuries being \"encouraged\" not to kill each other by the Romans, many did not feel that a return to the ways of their ancestors would prove to be the most beneficial solution. This problem was quickly solved by the arrival of the Goths, who unsportingly killed thousands in the southern regions of Britain. Eventually the kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, Dyfed and Seisyllg, Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh states. These Welsh states tirelessly worked together to establish the fair division of Wales and its sovereignty from England. Not really, they started a war with each other that only ended when they agreed that the only people that they hated more than each other were the English, so fought with them instead. \nYou may be getting the impression that the Welsh were a very unpleasant and disagreeable people, this is of course not the universal case, they were all very unpleasant and violent people. edit A Legislature of their Own \nAfter the separation from England in 1974 Wales held a referendum on whether to forget about politics and live the simple life, or to establish some sort of legislative body. The vote was a crushing defeat for the supporters of politics when the only person who bothered voting flipped a coin and decided on a simple life. The Welsh cabinet, debating constitutional reform. \nBy 1997, however, the Welsh were growing restless. The lack of a legislative body had deprived them of their greatest pastime, arguing. Therefore they decided to form the Welsh County Council . Although officially based in a greenhouse in Cardiff Bay, the members usually meet every other Thursday at Clwb y Bont in Pontypridd. Not only has it been a great arena for arguing, petty point scoring and big boasts (again, the bastions of Welsh sport) but, quite unexpectedly, it has improved the lives of the Welsh population. Most analysts accredit this to the Council‚Äôs immense wealth which it has amassed by threatening the European Union with the possibility of dumping thousands of annoying horns outside the stadiums of every professional team on the continent. To keep Wales at bay the EU funds its every whim. \nSome of the most high-profile schemes funded by the County Council include the popular game-show Dr Who ?, keeping Charlotte Church in England, half price pints for under 16s on a Thursday across Wales and free travel for people with three legs on local bus services between 11pm and 1am in the Valleys. The rest of their budget is spent on supplying the Department for Racial Diversity and Linguistic Purity (Welsh: Bwrdd Croeso i Gymru Saeson Ewch Adref ) with paper napkins and plastic coffee stirrers. edit Civil War \nRecently the Welsh have been living under the cloud of a Cold Civil War, begun shortly after the establishment of the Welsh County Council. While the whole point of the body was to encourage arguing and fighting, the Welsh appetite for such actions was clearly underestimated. The County Council poured resources into the Southern areas, building icons such as the Centurion Stadium, the Armadillo Centre and, of course, the Greenhouse Council House. \nThe buffer zone between North and South is known by its own, internal inhabitants as \"Mid Wales\". Borders are disputed, but are believed to originate somewhere between Pwllheli and Aberystwyth . However, in official parlance the term \"Demilitarised Zone\" is preferred, as the British army is currently engaged in conflicts abroad, in Afghanistan and Croydon . \nWhile Southern analysts have put the blame purely on the shoulders of what they deem the jealous North, Northern analysts claim the same in reverse, that is, that the South is simply jealous of the fact that North Wales got Rhyl. edit Fears of Disintegration \nNotwithstanding the impending civil war, there is a real fear of the disintegration of Wales. The 4th biggest, and some say most influential, city in Wales, Llandwrog, has recently been pushing for independence. Their claim lies in a thousand year old poem ‚ÄúWylit Wylit Llandwrog, Wylit waed pe gwelit hyn‚Äù. Other towns that appear to be following suit include The Millennium Stadium, Borth, Portmeirion, and, most disturbingly of all, the Brains Brewery. Newport recently announced their intention to seek independence, but no-one in Wales seemed to care. \nIn 1259 the Last King of Wales, Llywelyn the Daft, decided to try and cut Wales off from England, and float off somewhere warmer, Australia probably. So Llywelyn set all the men of the kingdom to dig down as far as they could until they reached the bottom of the sea, and they could float off. The Englishmen helped as well, because they were sick of the sight of the Welsh people as well, and the smell of cheese. Obviously, with a medieval understanding of geology the whole enterprise was doomed to failure. To take their revenge, Llywelyn's men cut off his willy, to the cry of \"off with his dick\". There is a permanent trench between Wales and England, named after Llywelyn's method of death disgrace, these days known as Offa's Dyke. The Welsh people never forgot this ambition, and when they discovered Australia they named it New Wales, but again the English people foiled their plans, and only New South Wales remains of this. edit Geography How the British Isles is seen to everyone else. \nThe landscape of Wales was the largest single project ever undertaken by the BBC. In readiness for the filming of Torchwood, Wales was constructed over a prolonged period of time on a disused sound stage, just west of Bristol. The BBC only allowed the filming of Gavin and Stacey on condition that one of the settings for some key characters was changed from 'somewhere else in Essex' to Wales. The people of Wales are so dedicated to their roles as supporting characters in these programmes that, if asked about it, they will even feign annoyance. \nMuch of Wales's diverse landscape is mountainous and consists of four main mountain ranges known as Snowdonia, Cambrian, The Brecon Beacons and Mordor. The mountainous areas of Wales are used primarily for agriculture and are heavily populated with farmers, farmers' wives, dragons, sheep, tourists and orcs. \nThe beauty of the Welsh landscape attracts many tourists and hobbits to the country each year, and in an effort to avoid this and confuse potential tourists the Welsh government passed a law to remove over 55% of all vowels used in the place names of its towns and villages. The results of this law were mixed as tourism continued to flourish; on a more positive note, however, incidents of hobbit hooliganism took a drastic fall. \nUnlike many other countries of its kind, Wales is completely and utterly invisible. If viewed from above, you will merely see an extension of the Catlantic ocean, and all aerial photographs or satellite images of the area are purely artists' impression. edit Climate Highest maximum temperature: When the sun comes out (albeit covered by rain clouds) and the temperature reads -10 degrees Celsius. Lowest minimum temperature: You'll know when the air is frozen Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a day: N/A Average yearly rainfall in MM: Infinity Yearly sunshine: At best, 0 hours, at worse -12 hours. edit Sport \nThe national sport of Wales is arguing. A Welshman takes great pride in his ability to argue with anyone for no apparent reason, even if secretly he agrees. Being from a different county/town/village/street/house/side-of-the-bed of someone else is usually enough to guarantee a fight, while supporting a different rugby team guarantees a war. Northies and southies are guaranteed to start arguing if they come within close contact with each other. Neither side can understand what the other is saying, and thus the arguments mostly always end in a draw. The only time when Welshmen refrain from arguing with each other is when there's an Englishman present. In such a situation the Welsh become brothers-in-arms and turn on the intruder, with whom they disagree completely. \nFollowing the unwritten laws of national sports, which states that every country has to be good at something, the Welsh are quite skilled in the art of throwing a ball around. In one memorable match they managed to throw and catch the ball a stunning 21 times. The English struggle with this, and are often prone to fits of jealousy; during one match, the Englishmen in the crowd began throwing crumpets at the Welsh players. However, it must be noted that the Welsh have thus far failed to win any significant international tournament and indeed were incapable of beating the fearsome nation of Fiji in the last world cup. \nHistorically, the Welsh have been world-beaters in the popular sport of \"Burn the Englishman's Holiday Home\". Meibion Glynd≈µr were the big league team of this sport, the equivalent of Manchester United or Liverpool FC . Because the English are actually decended from German ancestors, they had no sense of humour and didn't see the funny side in having their expensive luxury homes burned to a crisp. Unfortunately for the Welsh, this sport was outlawed in 2003 due to EU constraints on carbon emissions. \nA popular sport is the Welsh Pentathalon, which is a team sport consisting of four events: male voice choir singing, spoon carving, origami, and male voice solo. A by-product of this has been the mass migration of those with brains to the South East of England. \nThe traditional English game of Countdown was invented in Wales. However, this game proved to be troublesome due to the distinct lack of consonants and space for the long words, such as Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantyseiliogogogoch. edit Library \nThere is one Library in Wales. This is called \"The National Library\" and is situated in Aberystwyth . It has a collection of over 40 books and is world renowned as being the only library in the world with more staff than books.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T07:06:52.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
