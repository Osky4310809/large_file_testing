The film, called Snatched , features a recently dumped young woman named Emily (Schumer) dragging her uptight mother, Linda (Hawn), on what seems like a picturesque vacation to South America. They're soon kidnapped, and, naturally, hijinks ensue. The costars have already gotten a bit of heat for the film thanks to a dance routine they performed to Beyoncé's \"Formation,\" but hopefully this will be a fantastic return to the big screen for Hawn, who hasn't appeared on film since 2002's The Banger Sisters . Snatched also costars Ike Barinholtz, Wanda Sykes, and Joan Cusack and hits theaters on Mother's Day weekend.
