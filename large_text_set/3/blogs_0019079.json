After which, you can probably get them all completely wrong as well. Andrew's predictions \n\"Let's make one thing clear before we start - this is a bit of fun, based on not very much evidence at all. So let's not fall out if it's wrong. \n\"Having said that, pre-season testing did give some indications about how the year might shape up. No-one would be surprised if Mercedes turned up in Melbourne and blitzed everyone again. But it does not look that way right now. So assuming the picture so far is accurate, let's take a deep breath and jump in. Top three drivers \n2.Vettel \n3.Ricciardo \n\"If the Mercedes and Ferrari are the two fastest cars, my money would be on Hamilton to beat Vettel to the championship. \n\"He's just that bit faster and better, as long as he can keep weekends such as Baku and Singapore last year to a minimum. It's a tough call between the two Red Bull drivers, but I've gone for Ricciardo to edge it just on the basis of last year. 'Verstappen's better than you, mate!' No, he's definitely not listening \n\"There was a sense of a momentum swing towards Verstappen at the end of 2016, though, both in races and in the pattern of qualifying. In which case the Dutchman could easily swing it.\" Your turn...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:48:05.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
