The project was further endorsed a year later when a vast number of church leaders met in Chicago in 1966. \nResponsibillity: \nThe job of creating the new version was delegated to a body of fifteen biblical scholars, called the Committee on Bible Translation . And the New York Bible Society (now known as the International Bible Society) assumed financial support of the project in 1967. \nQuality of Translation: \nMore than one hundred scholars worked to develop the New International Version from the best available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. The process of translating each book was appointed to a team of scholars, and the work was painstakingly reviewed and revised at many stages by three separate committees. Samples of the translation were carefully tested for clarity and ease of reading by various groups of people. The NIV is likely to be the most thoroughly tested, reviewed and revised translation ever released. \nPurpose of the New International Version: \nThe Committee's goals were to produce \"an accurate, beautiful, clear, and dignified translation suitable for public and private reading, teaching, preaching, memorizing, and liturgical use.\" \nUnited Commitment: \nThe translators shared a united commitment to the authority and infallibility of the Bible as God's written word. They were also in agreement that in order to faithfully communicate the original meaning of the writers, it would require frequent changes in sentence structure resulting in a \"thought-for-thought\" translation. At the forefront of their approach was a constant attentiveness to the contextual meanings of words. \nCompletion of the New International Version: \nThe New Testament NIV was completed and published in 1973, after which the Committee once again carefully reviewed suggestions for revisions. Many of these changes were adopted and incorporated into the first printing of the complete Bible in 1978. Further changes were made in 1984 and in 2011. \nThe original idea was to continue the work of translation so that the NIV would always reflect the very best of biblical scholarship and contemporary English. The Committee meets yearly to review and consider changes. \nCopyright Information: \nThe NIV®, TNIV®, NIrV® may be quoted in any form (written, visual, electronic or audio) up to and inclusive of five hundred (500) verses without the express written permission of the publisher, providing the verses quoted do not amount to a complete book of the Bible nor do the verses quoted account for more than 25 percent (25%) or more of the total text of the work in which they are quoted. \nWhenever any portion of the NIV® text is reproduced in any format, notice of copyright and trademark ownership must appear on the title or copyright page or opening screen of the work (as appropriate) as follows.
