He said that possible indications that he may be an Islamic extremist were being looked into.\"There are individual indications (of extremism) that we have to investigate. There is one contact that is pretty clear and there are several indications that will be looked at intensively,\" Sobotka said. \nEarlier, police spokesman Thomas Keiblinger told the Austria Press Agency that the man had been under observation after authorities received a tip from a \"foreign intelligence service,\" and was arrested on Friday afternoon in a Vienna apartment by a SWAT team. \n\"The man has been in custody... There are still lots of things to clear up,” Keiblinger told the Austria Press Agency. \nAustria's Kronen Zeitung said the tip received had been that \"a group of Albanian Islamic extremists\" were planning an attack in Vienna between January 15 and January 30. \nPolice issued a public warning for people to be on the lookout at crowded public places and to inform police if they see any suspicious objects. \nPolice also increased the number of officers on the street. \nAustria has been spared in the string of attacks by Islamists suffered by other European countries but has increased security measures.
