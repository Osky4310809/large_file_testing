This isn't that car, clearly, but it could well be the last Vantage special edition.Off the back of the collaboration that will create the AM-RB 001 , this is the Aston Vantage Red Bull Racing Edition. In fact that should be Editions, as both V8 S and V12 S coupes are being offered.\nDon't think, however, that these are vehicles carrying race car technology for the road; the Red Bull Editions are less involved than that. The cars in fact been made by Aston Martin's 'Q' personalisation department, giving a strong hint at the kind of special editions these are. Mechanically the cars are identical with all of them painted Mariana Blue as standard, with red accents to the grille and side vents, plus yellow calipers, to evoke the Red Bull F1 cars. Alternatively buyers can choose from Tungsten Silver or satin Mariana Blue. \nInside customers will be able to choose which Red Bull F1 driver they would like to sign the sill plaques, plus be treated to Red Bull headrest embroidery, carbon trim and diamond quilting. What a treat. \nBoth the Red Bull Racing Editions are available to order now, with deliveries set to begin in Q2. Just the thing to take down to Silverstone in the summer. If you are interested, customers are advised to speak to their local dealer for exact RRP and availability. P.H.
