King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 4 hours ago 11 Classic Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman stated he will not be attending the band's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction at the April 7 ceremony at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.The musician noted via official site: \"News has broken that Yes are to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and so before the barrage of questions start arriving to the website, here are the answers to what I'm guessing will be the most asked questions... and no others will be answered!\"Q: Are you pleased Yes have been inducted?A: \"Well I would have been if it had happened years ago when it was really well deserved. I find it hard to come to terms with the fact that so many bands are inducted into the Hall of Fame too late in their careers after key members have passed away. Classic examples are The Who and John Entwistle, Deep Purple and Jon Lord and now Yes and there will be no Chris Squire.\"Q: Will there be a sort of Yes reunion at the induction and will you be part of that?A. \"I have no idea if there will be any sort of reunion, but whatever happens under no circumstances will I be any part of it, neither will I be attending.\"As reported, the prog masters are to be inducted into the Hall along with Joan Baez, Electric Light Orchestra, Journey, Pearl Jam, and Tupac.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:03:12.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
