Photo: Apple \nApple will soon lose the veteran coder who helped make Swift one of the fastest-growing computer languages in the world. Chris Lattner, who has worked as Apple’s director of developer tools for the past few years, revealed today that he is leaving the company to join Tesla.\nLattner is most famous for creating the LLVM compiler infrastructure project as a graduate. He joined Apple in 2005, and integrated LLVM’s collection of modular and compiler technologies into Apple’s developer tools. In 2010, Lattner designed and built most of Swift, the simplified computer language used to create iOS apps. \nApple unveiled Swift in 2014 as the computer language of the future. In a note detailing his departure , Lattner says ongoing development of Swift won’t be set back by his leaving Cupertino. \n“I’m happy to announce that Ted Kremenek will be taking over for me as “Project Lead” for the Swift project, managing the administrative and leadership responsibility for Swift.org. This recognizes the incredible effort he has already been putting into the project, and reflects a decision I’ve made to leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space. This decision wasn’t made lightly, and I want you all to know that I’m still completely committed to Swift. I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list.” \nIt was later revealed that Lattner is joining Telsa , where he will work as the VP of Autopilot software, which is probably one of the coolest software gigs you can get. \nIn other news from the department of employees leaving Apple, Daniel Gross is leaving the company . Gross was the founder of Cue, a search engine for personal content that was acquired by Apple in 2013. He will join Y Combinator as a partner but told TechCrunch he wants to start another company when the time is right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:34:07.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
