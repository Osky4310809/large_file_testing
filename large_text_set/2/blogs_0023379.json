Since getting drafted out of Ateneo de Manila University in 2006, Tenorio has played in almost 500 games. \n“‘Di ko alam papaano i-explain ‘yun,” he said. “Pag-aalaga lang ng katawan ‘yan. Iniisip ko kasi, talagang katawan ko puhunan ko.” \nFor 11 years, Tenorio has played in 488 games in succession. Fortunately, he hasn’t fallen prey to the injury bug. \nBut what also makes the feat noteworthy is because the 5-foot-8 backcourt operator also had extracurricular duties. Tenorio—on top playing for three teams—also lent his services to the national team.   \nThe Batangueño has been in the second edition of the Gilas crew that won gold in the 2012 Jones Cup. He also saw action 2014 World Cup, the Asian Games of the same year, and continued to be a part of the pool that competed in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament here. \n“I think it's my family's support din talaga,” Tenorio shared when asked what keeps him at tip-top shape. “They're really supportive, I think importante yun eh. That's part of pag-aalaga din sa katawan ko kasi lahat naman ng ginagawa namin para din sa pamilya.” \n\"Medyo nag-konting diet pero still, workout pa rin. Malaking bagay ‘yung workout,” he added. “‘Di ko naman tinitigil ‘yon unless every other day ang game.” \nBut more importantly, the six-time PBA All-Star and two-time Finals MVP said that faith had also a hand in it. \n“Sa akin, malaking bagay talaga yun nakukuha sa dasal. Every game, every day, pinagdarasal ko na kahit anong mangyari, manalo man o matalo, walang injury,” he noted. \nTenorio’s astounding streak will definitely reach 490th mark as his team takes on the defending champion San Miguel Beermen starting Friday. The game tips off 7 p.m. at the Mall of Asia Arena.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:38:32.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
