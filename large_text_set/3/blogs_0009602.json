Pictures shows a scene from, “Kong: Skull Island.” AP \nLOS ANGELES, United States — In the box office battle of the beasts, King Kong easily conquered Wolverine. \n“Kong: Skull Island,” the latest in a series of films starring the legendary great ape, bested “Logan” to top the North American box office in its debut weekend, industry estimates showed Sunday. \nThe film starring Britain’s Tom Hiddleston, Oscar winner Brie Larson and the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson tells the story of a group of explorers on a mysterious island that happens to be Kong’s domain. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe latest reboot of the 1933 Hollywood monster movie classic raked in $61 million over the weekend, according to industry tracker Exhibitor Relations. \nThat easily topped the $37.9 million brought in by “Logan,” which stars Hugh Jackman in his final performance as the metal-clawed, mutant anti-hero Wolverine. \nIn just two weeks in theaters, “Logan” has brought in nearly $153 million. \nBumped down to third place was the socially conscious horror thriller “Get Out,” the surprise hit of the year, with $21.1 million. \nJordan Peele’s directorial debut — he is half of the comedy duo “Key and Peele”— follows an African American (Daniel Kaluuya) who goes with his white girlfriend (Allison Williams) to meet her family for the first time, but quickly realizes something sinister is afoot at their country estate. \nThe smart satire cost $4.5 million to produce and has already taken in more than $111 million in three weeks. \n“The Shack,” based on a Christian-oriented novel by Canadian author William Young about a grieving man’s spiritual journey after his child dies, landed in fourth place with just over $10 million. \nFifth place went to CGI comedy “The Lego Batman Movie,” with $7.8 million and an overall box office haul of $159 million in five weeks. \nFeaturing the voice of Will Arnett as the caped crusader, the Warner Bros spinoff of “The Lego Movie” follows Batman as he tries to save Gotham City from being taken over by the Joker, voiced by Zach Galifianakis.
