We started well, we had possession, we showed quality, we defended well and we were solid. \nAlves not keen on Barcelona reunion \n\"We knew we had to score at least two goals, but we didn't want to lose our identity. And we didn't until the red card. \n\"In the second half I have to salute the support we had from our fans. It was their support that gave us the strength to keep our balance, to not concede any more goals and to even create a few chances in the second 45 minutes. \n\"We leave more united than ever.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:14:30.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
