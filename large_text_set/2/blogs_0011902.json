This is gonna be one of the best eyeshadow palettes of the year!\n6 new Melted Matte Lipstick Shades. #SneakyPeek New Melted Matte shades coming your way! #March2017 #summer #toofaced \nA photo posted by Jerrod Blandino (@jerrodblandino) on Jan 18, 2017 at 10:21am PST \nWe have fully passed on from the anticipation of getting our hands on these gorgeous new lipsticks. Not only are the pinky purple shades absolutely to die for and ideal for spring, but the addition of that vibrant teal green pushes it over the top into iconic territory. Only a genius like Blandino could pull something like this off, do you think it’s fair to send him our blood pressure medication bill? Because we can’t handle this much beauty! You’ll be able to get these gorgeous products starting on March 9th, which all things considered isn’t too far off! Just daydreaming about one day having a chance to use these will get us through our current national nightmare. If you need a lil something in the meantime to keep you busy til then, head on over to Too Faced Cosmetics and take a gander!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:20:13.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
