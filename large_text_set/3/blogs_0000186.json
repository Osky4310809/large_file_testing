She went for curved work tops in the kitchen (Photo: Sandra Vijandi) Her bathroom is futuristic (Photo: Sandra Vijandi) \nIn the bathroom, Sheridan went for a futuristic blue LED lighting scheme. \nThe actress owns the flat and has lived in North London for almost 20 years. \nShe recently suffered a devastating bereavement with the loss of her father, Colin, but Sheridan has overcome her upset enough to head-up the UK tour of Funny Girl : The Musical. \nThe blonde star, 35, was all smiles as she attended a photocall for the hit show at the Palace Theatre in Manchester earlier this month. \nAppearing in a buoyant mood, she was joined by co-star Chris Peluso and her beloved pet pooch - a little Pomeranian dog named Pandora - for the event, which is designed to boost ticket sales. \nDressed to impress, the blonde actress, from Lincolnshire, sported an all-black ensemble which was topped with a leather jacket. She scraped her hair back for a neat look and wore plenty of make-up. Sheridan was beaming (Photo: FameFlynet) And who wouldn't be with that little cutie on your lap (Photo: Splash News) \nSmiling broadly, there was no sign of the grief she must be feeling following her father's from cancer in December. \nSheridan took a break from her West End show Funny Girl after the diagnosis and cancelled her Royal Variety performance on December 6 so she could focus on grieving. \nA statement said at the time: \"Sheridan's much loved father sadly passed away this week. We can confirm that she will not be performing at the Royal Variety Performance this Tuesday.
