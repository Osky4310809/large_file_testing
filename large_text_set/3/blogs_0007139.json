It also suspends the refugee resettlement process for 120 days. \nWashington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who successfully got the previous executive order suspended, on Monday said his office was evaluating whether it would challenge the new order and would likely decide this week. \nImmigration advocates said the new ban still discriminated against Muslims and failed to address some of their concerns with the previous directive. \nLegal experts said it would, however, be harder to challenge because it affects fewer people living in the United States and allows more exemptions to protect them.
