In recent seasons, Karl Lagerfeld has riffed on “intimate technology” , airport style , and Italian cinema , but today’s presentation had humbler beginnings: a spoon. \nOf course, it wasn’t a spoon he found in the kitchen. More specifically, it was Alberto Giacometti’s sculpture Spoon Woman (1926), which might appear to be a giant spoon from afar, but abstractly depicts a woman’s neck, bust, and nipped-in waist at the top, then curves into wide, spoon-like “hips.” Perhaps Lagerfeld thought it looked like a circle skirt. A cast of the sculpture sits in the collection of the Guggenheim Museum; its website reports that Giacometti was inspired by “ceremonial spoons of the African Dan culture, in which the bowl of the utensil can be equated with a woman’s womb.” Expand Alberto Giacometti, Femme Cuillère (Spoon Woman). 1926, Bronze. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York \nYou can see the spoon’s influence in many of Lagerfeld’s couture looks: Skirtsuits are belted high and tight to emphasize the curve of the hips, while a few gowns arc dramatically away from the body. For the most part, the torso and shoulders are fitted or a bit shrunken; the tweed jackets in particular mimic the squared-off lines of Giacometti’s bust. It’s a classic, womanly style that also happens to be quite flattering, which Chanel’s customers will no doubt appreciate.
