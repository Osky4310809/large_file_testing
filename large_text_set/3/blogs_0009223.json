He insisted at the time that his office tried repeatedly to reach Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) but their calls had gone unanswered. Cummings rejected that claim and said he'd be happy to meet with the president. Weeks went by and it's now finally happening . \nThe two are set to meet on Wednesday and the issue at hand will be prescription drug prices. \n\"The president promised — both during the campaign and after — that he would support efforts to stem the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs, so I am looking forward to discussing ideas he said he supports,\" Cummings said on Tuesday. \nRecently, Trump vowed to dramatically decrease drug prices and increase competition. \nIn Cummings, Trump finds a Democrat who at least accepts him as a legitimate president. His remarks leave some room for hope that the two can find some common ground and come to a consensus on how they can work together to help patients afford their health care.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T02:10:48.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
