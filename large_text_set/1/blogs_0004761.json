Plan ahead and move quickly, because the restaurant is closing for good on Jan. 27. When Macy’s pulled the plug on its downtown St. Paul store in 2013, reservations quickly filled for that store’s River Room restaurant. Oak Grill reservations can be made at opentable.com; the restaurant does not accept reservations over the phone. The adjacent Skyroom restaurant serves weekday lunch on a first-come, first-serve basis. @RickNelsonStrib", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:20:35.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
