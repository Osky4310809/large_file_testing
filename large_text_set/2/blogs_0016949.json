It shows Ford's approach which came dangerously close to an American Airlines 737 which was on the taxiway when the actor's plane passed overhead. \nA man in the terminal who took a picture of the landing told us Ford had misjudged the runway and banked sharply before landing on the taxiway, but that is not reflected in this video.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:53:19.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
