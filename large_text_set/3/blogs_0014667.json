Why? The FPAI had written a letter to the Football Sport Development Ltd, which organises the Indian Super League, putting forward recommendations for the next season. And Das was responding to what he thought of it. Too quick on the draw was he. Shouldn’t the AIFF be working with the players, or at least keeping it that way for all to see?\nThe demands, so to speak, could be important if the rumours that the AIFF is fast tracking a move to get the ISL and I-League to integrate are true. And one of the ‘side-effects’ of the move was a point of discussion in the FPAI letter to FSDL – the draft system.\nMost others seem straightforward – longer contract periods, a minimum pay – both to offer Indian players greater job security and removal of cap on number of Indian players in a team (because each team is required to sign at least eight foreigners, including the marque, and can field as many as six in a starting lineup). Some of these could apply to I-League clubs as well of course.\nBut the possibility of a draft system needs explaining. According to Cyrus Confectioner, general manager, FPAI, it is to reboot the current player contracts if the two leagues ‘merge’, and new teams are introduced into the ISL. He adds that the FPAI contacted players and found that most would like to have a control over where they would play and how they negotiate their contracts. A draft system will discount player choices.\nNeither the AIFF nor the FSDL have responded to any of the recommendations specifically, nor have either written back to the FPAI. But surely those that pertain to job security cannot be denied as the norm for much longer. And that the ISL claims to want to improve Indian football means that they cannot deny that having a cap on number of local players works in the opposite direction.\nThe thing is that the draft system and the merger are still only rumours – the news reports Quote: d unnamed sources and FPAI came about the information due to their association with players. At the cost of stating the obvious, Indian football is still a fiefdom being fought for and no one will yield an inch until everyone knows who’s won.\nWhy couldn’t the AIFF not put out a more professional reaction – the ‘we will look into it’ variety? India is after all a full member of FIFPro, the global players’ organisation and FPAI, whatever faults it may have, is the player representative. Confectioner says the AIFF and the FPAI have worked together before and so is surprised by the latest comments.\nThe draft system also affects foreign players. Baljit Rihal, CEO of UK-based Inventive Sports which has dealt with ISL clubs, reckons international stars are likely to say no.\n“I personally don’t believe it would attract higher calibre professionals as the concept of a draft system would mean all players would be on equal remuneration.\n“I know for a fact, that many of the internationals who have previously been part of the ISL would want to go to the clubs of their choice and ultimately where their agents can get the best deal possible… To attract better international players, the clubs in the ISL will have to offer more money than in previous seasons, especially if the tournament will run for the longer 5 months as speculated. Will a foreign players draft work to achieve this? My view is that it would not…”\nSo, where is this mess going? What should have been a professional interaction between the country’s football association and a player representative was played out in the open. And there’s no upside to it. Surely the players will eventually be contacted if their current contracts are to be changed and they will organise themselves, sooner rather than later, as the game becomes more professional in India. Would it not be better for the AIFF to start working with the players, rather than against them?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:23:44.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
