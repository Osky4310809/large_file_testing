For some perspective, Hillary Clinton was the presidential frontrunner the last time markets fell 1%. This was the longest such streak for both indices in over 20 years. \nIn February, the DJIA recorded its longest “winning streak” since 1987. It closed 2,000 points above its 200-day moving average for the first time ever. \nAlso in February, the combined market cap of the S&P 500 topped $20 trillion for the first time. Its market cap has increased by over $2 trillion since the election—staggering. \nLike we discussed last month , with a proliferation of “record” highs in 2017, where are market valuations at today? The five charts below paint the whole picture best. Chart #1: S&P 500 Price/EBITDA \nToday, the S&P 500 price/EBITDA sits at an all-time high. \nThis tells us that the current rally can be largely attributed to “valuation expansion.” Indeed, around 60% of the gains since 2009 have come from this source. At the same time, earnings growth has been anemic. \nFrom 2012–2016, annual earnings growth was just 0.49%. In comparison, from 1995–1999, growth was 9.5%. Chart #2: CAPE \nAnother commonly used metric is the cyclically adjusted, price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE). \nCurrently, the CAPE is 73% above its mean. Besides its reading before the 1929 crash and dot-com bubble, the ratio is at its highest level on record. \nSource: Robert Shiller Chart #3: Total Market Cap/GDP \nWarren Buffet’s favorite valuation metric, total market cap relative to GDP, currently stands at 130%—a 129% increase since 2009. This rise also brings the ratio to its highest level since 2000. \nSource: Gurufocus Chart #4: NYSE Margin Debt \nHigh levels of margin debt lead to increased volatility as more people are forced to sell due to margin calls. \nIn January, margin debt hit another record high. The two previous tops were one month and three months prior to the respective 2000 and 2008 market crashes. \nSource: Advisor Perspectives Chart #5: The Complacency Index \nMargin debt making another “all-time high” signals the cycle is in late stages when complacency takes hold. And surprise, surprise, that too is at all-time highs. \nSource: Bloomberg \nIn the past, when the complacency index was high, stocks invariably saw big corrections shortly thereafter. \nBy most metrics, equities look pricey . But even with the bull market now eight years old, sentiment continues to be extremely bullish . So, what are the takeaways from these lofty valuations? Lower Future Returns and Higher Downside Risk \nTo quote Warren Buffet, “The price you pay determines your rate of return.” In a nutshell, this sums up what today’s valuations mean for investors. \nHigh valuation metrics aren’t indicative of an imminent market crash. What they do tell us is that we must lower our expectations of future returns. \nWhile the correlation isn’t perfect, this chart shows a higher CAPE ratio usually means lower future returns. \nSource: Bloomberg \nWith the stunning run-up in markets since 2009, investors can’t reasonably expect returns to continue at double the long-term average . At a time of exuberance, it’s important to remember markets are cyclical. \nThe other takeaway from today’s valuations is that when the drawdown does come, it will be severe. As this chart from Star Capital shows, downside risk tends to increase as market valuations become excessive. \nGiven current market levels, investors may want to lower their future expected returns. It’s important to note that “record highs” are records for a reason. It’s where previous limits were reached. \nWith that in mind, how should investors approach the markets today? Adopt a Contrarian Investment Strategy \nWhile markets continue to make new highs, investors should proceed with care. This is the second-longest period in stock market history without a 10% correction. As detailed above, the higher valuations go, the worst the subsequent drop. \nThe average decline during the last five bear markets was 33% - the next one could be much worse. Of course, markets could rise another 50% from here before falling. But given their run-up since 2009— is it a risk worth taking? \n* * * \nLearn More About the Contrarian Value Strategy in Our Free Report, 3 Proven Strategies to Invest in Uncertain Markets Like These - In this report, we detail three strategies investors can use to find value in today’s generally overpriced markets.
