His poetic observation of the patterns of beach bums lazing in the sand and his daily hygiene routine blend with both cute and cutting surveillence of relationships . One minute he's noticing how the sun over the ocean looks kind of like an umbrella, the next he's describing a relationship as a chasm over which the man has blown a bridge of bubbles labeled, \"Promises.\" Ouch. \nRobichek also mixes his illustrations with photography, á la Marty Cooper , Jean Jullien , and Sean Charmantz , playing with spacial relations or adding plot twists to his coarse black-and-white film. Based in Tel Aviv, Robichek's work has appeared on the cover of REST magazine, and he's currently working on a campaign with Perrier. Enjoy a taste of his perverse humor and knack for turning shapes into emotional observations in the Instagrams below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T19:38:49.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
