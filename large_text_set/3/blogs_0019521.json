(WBZ-TV) \nThose airlines will have just four days to comply or they risk having the Federal Aviation Administration stop their flights into the U.S. \nMany passengers on Emirates Flight 239 from Dubai were not aware of the new ban as they arrived at Logan Airport Tuesday morning. \n“Of course it’s inconvenient, yeah it’s insane,” passenger Mohamed Kante told WBZ-TV. “It’s a long flight. You need to be distracted. You need to do work.” \n“The flight is very long and some of us do work in the air,” said another Emirates passenger, Rakib Ouro-Djobo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:51:52.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
