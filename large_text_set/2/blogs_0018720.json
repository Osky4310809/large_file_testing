Casinos in Goa can be found on boats anchored in the Mandovi River, and onshore in some upmarket hotels. Most of the action, with live tables, takes place on the floating casinos -- which are entertainment destinations within themselves. By law, onshore casinos can only have electronic games. \nThe offshore casino market is dominated by the Deltin Group and the Pride Group. Deltin's modern and classy casinos have higher entry fees and focus on a niche segment. They're particularly popular with players of western games. The Pride Group, with lower entry fees, caters more to the masses and the Indian market. \nThe Pride Group also operates three onshore casinos -- Casino Pearl at Bogmallo, Casino Palms at Baga, and Casino Paradise at Pororvim. However, these casinos are more suited to habitual gamblers than tourists. Deltin Royale 1.
