Some big names being mentioned. But we'll see who makes the cut,” Spieth said on Tuesday at the Sony Open. “We are not limiting the field to four.” \nOn Wednesday, Thomas – who won last week’s SBS Tournament of Champions – was even more aloof regarding #SB2K17. \n“We don't even know when we're going or if we can go just because of all four of our schedules matching up,” he said. “We just got lucky last year and I don't know if we're going to be able to do it every year. I guess we'll wait and see. Who knows, may be going next week. You never know.” \nAs for who could be added to the #SB2K17 dance card, Rory McIlroy was offered an invitation last year to Baker’s Bay but had a scheduling conflict. After last year’s trip went viral, the Northern Irishman tweeted, “After seeing all these Snapchats over the last few days, Maybe I should have taken [Fowler] up on the invite.” \nIn April, even Gary Player tweeted he would be open to an invite: #SpringBreak c.1965. @JackNicklaus and I out on safari in South Africa. Good times.
