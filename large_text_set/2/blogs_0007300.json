But would it be enough to keep up with the Manchester giants and Chelsea as the Premier League's financial muscle grew? Arsenal FC via Getty Images \nArsenal legend Ian Wright has claimed that Arsene Wenger has told him he is coming to the end of his time managing the club. \nWenger has yet to sign an extension to his contract, which expires at the end of the season, and refused to offer any clarification over his future when asked in his press conference on Thursday. \nIt has led to intense speculation that Wenger may be about to end his over-20 year tenure at Arsenal, something which Wright has done little to dampen by claiming that the Frenchman discussed his future with him on Thursday night. \n“I was with the boss last night and if I’m going to be totally honest I get the impression that that’s it,” Wright told BBC Radio Five Live. “I was with him for a few hours last night and we’re talking. Arsene Wenger: 20 years with Arsenal \n“He didn’t say to me ‘I’m leaving at the end of the season’ but… I get the impression looking at him that that’s it. \n“He actually mentioned when I was talking to him last night that he’s coming to the end. I’ve never heard him say that.” Up to 10,000 fans can’t face Hull match as pressure mounts on Wenger \nArsenal’ second highest goalscorer, Wright played under Wenger between 1996 and 1998. The pair were last night at a Q&A event along with Arsenal Ladies’ captain Alex Scott. \nThe 53-year-old’s comments come after several days in which speculation that Wenger may be about to move on has greatly increased, with Borussia Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel and Juventus’ Massimiliano Allegri asked whether they had been contacted over a possible vacancy. \nNotably RB Leipzig boss Ralph Hassenhuttl hinted there was an element of truth to claims he had been approached by the Emirates hierarchy when asked about the job last year.
