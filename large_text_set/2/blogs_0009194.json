Keith Ellison on Monday to lead the Democratic National Committee.\nThe endorsement came just days after 10 candidates to lead the national Democratic Party held a forum in Baltimore to debate the future of the Democratic party under President Donald Trump. \n\"In this moment, the Democratic Party needs a leader who has the wherewithal to unite and lead the opposition,\" said Jealous, a Baltimore native and Maryland resident. \n\"With a young, progressive leader who rose from the grassroots, Keith’s election will energize the Democratic base and ensure that state, county and local Democratic organizations are provided with the tools and financial resources necessary to build the party from the bottom up,\" he said. \nThe support is likely to reinforce the idea that Ellison speaks to the more liberal, outsider wing of the party.
