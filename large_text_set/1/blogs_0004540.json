I love being part of this team, this organization and this city. So when it comes around, it comes around. I’m not really tripping. I save my money pretty good. I have a good portfolio, so I’m not really tripping right now.” \nBennett played in all 16 games during the regular season, catching 55 passes for 701 yards and a career-high seven touchdowns. His 12.7 yards-per-catch average was his highest since his rookie year. \nThe 27-year-old is one of several high-profile Patriots players set to hit the open market this spring. Linebacker Dont’a Hightower, cornerback Logan Ryan, running back LeGarrette Blount, safety Duron Harmon, defensive tackle Alan Branch and defensive ends Jabaal Sheard and Chris Long also are on that list, as is impending restricted free-agent cornerback Malcolm Butler. \nThumbnail photo via Stew Milne/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T18:17:02.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
