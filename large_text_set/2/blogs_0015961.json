College students at the University of Cincinnati recently started a silent protest over the “state of the nation.” The News Record reports: \nThe protest was not targeted toward a specific issue or stance, but rather toward the state of the nation and acts of racism, sexism, xenophobia and other forms of bigotry perpetrated by President Trump’s administration and his supporters since the election. \nIn other words, they don’t have anything specific to protest. They just are mad and aren’t going to take it anymore. The piece continues: \n“The idea of a silent protest was to take up space and force people to witness our experiences without creating room for debate or differing opinions,” said Anahita Sharma, a fourth year liberal arts student. \nWhile debate can be helpful and constructive, there is a time and place for it, and sometimes it is inappropriate, according to [first-year psychology and political science student Mashal ] Ahmed. \nAhmed was also critical of the Delta Tau Delta, a fraternity that was tabling on the other side of MainStreet . \nWhile the fraternity had most likely not planned for the activists to be there, it was disrespectful for them to play pop music over the demonstration, said Ahmed. \n“When people are expressing their hurt and pain, it’s not the place to do so because you are essentially telling them that they are not validated in their feelings,” said Ahmed. “It’s not easy when holding protests to express that to people passing by.” \nIsn’t it hilarious how liberals don’t want room for differing opinions? When did Americans get so whiny? when did Americans forget that free speech was important… but it might be important to actually know what the heck you are talking about!! \nCollege students are wanting to be perceived as protesters even if there’s nothing to be upset about. Especially, since as PJ Media says, “The group didn’t have anything specific to protest, perhaps because they’re going to the University of Cincinnati, where they can afford the in-state tuition of only $28,002 per year. That’s still half the median income in the United States annually, so most can’t afford it — a clear sign they’re oh-so-oppressed.” \nThey don’t sound oppressed to me! \nFiled Under: Uncategorized Related posts from Bristol Palin:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:59:48.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
