Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool are targeting a move for Bordeaux starlet Malcolm - but face competition from Manchester United, according to Goal. \nThe Brazilian joined Bordeaux from Corinthians for just £5million last January and has since scored six times in his 30 appearances. \nHis performances have caught the eye of Premier League scouts, with both Liverpool and United believed to have been casting their eye over the 19-year-old. \nBut Malcolm says that he is only thinking about Bordeaux for the moment. \n\"This thing about Liverpool (and) Manchester – I don’t know anything about it,\" he said. \"I’m very calm, I only think about Bordeaux today. I want to do my job well and give French fans lots of joy.\" Reds warned off Perisic signing Perisic has been linked with moves away from Inter Milan (Photo: AFP) \nLiverpool have been warned that they cannot sign Ivan Perisic this summer. \nIt was claimed by Gazzetta dello Sport that the Reds had joined Premier League teams in the hunt for the Inter Milan winger. \nBut Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio says that the Croatian will not be leaving for the foreseeable future. \n\"I do not think it is either Perisic's or our intentions for him to leave,\" he said. \"He is part of a massive project and we do not want to sell our players. \n\"We cannot envisage an Inter without Perisic. We are not going to get rid of our best players.\" Klopp wary of \"new\" Leicester in King Power clash Klopp is aware of the danger that Leicester could face (Photo: Liverpool FC) \nJurgen Klopp believes Liverpool could be set to be the first team to come up against the 'new' Leicester, writes Mirror Football's Jack Rathborn. \nThe Reds chief is concerned that the Foxes could be revitalised by the time they make the trip to the King Power Stadium on February 27. \nClaudio Ranieri's side were stunned at Millwall in the FA Cup last weekend and face Sevilla in the Champions League before hosting Klopp's men, with the German acknowledging the threat his side face.
