But he has no intention of quitting the Etihad, despite his nightmare 18 months since joining the club. \nDelph, 27 , has managed just five appearances this campaign, and also missed a huge chunk of last season because of persistent injuries. \nIt has seen him go from being England regular to squad player under new Blues boss Pep Guardiola, having traded regular football with a relegation-bound Aston Villa side to chase silverware in Manchester at the start of the 2015-16 campaign. \nDelph has become a target for a loan move before next Tuesday's transfer deadline — Championship promotion chasers Newcastle are among those interested — but the midfielder insists he is going nowhere, and has no regrets.

I’m happy here. \n\"I’m obviously fit again and ­available for selection so I can get some more minutes and help the team to push on. I love it here. I’m working with the best players in the world, great management, great staff around me and I’m very, very happy here. \n“I’ve been injured for the best part of four-and-a-half months – I seem to be the forgotten man at the minute. Injury problems have seen Delph go from England regular...

He was branded a “snake” on social media by angry Villa fans.

We tried to rehab it for six or seven weeks and it wasn’t working. I kept getting little tears in my tendons.
