Risa Hontiveros, chair of the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality, explains to reporters Senate Bill No. 1326 or the \"Safe Streets and Public Spaces Act of 2017,\" during a press briefing, Tuesday morning, Feb. 14, 2017. Hontiveros said the bill seeks to protect women and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) community from harassment in the streets and other public spaces. She cited a Social Weather Station report which showed that almost 88 percent of Filipina women aged 18-24 years \"have experienced different forms of sexual harassment in the streets.\" Cesar Tomambo/Senate PRIB MANILA, Philippines — Sen. Risa Hontiveros on Tuesday filed a bill that seeks to protect women and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community from harassment in public spaces. Under Senate Bill No. 1326 or the \"Safe Streets and Public Spaces Act of 2017,\" catcalling, wolf-whistling, cursing, leering, groping, persistent requests for name and contact details and the use of words tending to ridicule on the basis of actual or perceived sex, gender expression, or sexual orientation and identity including sexist, homophobic and transphobic slurs in public spaces will be penalized. Hontiveros said the bill would complement the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law of 1995. “I filed the bill 23 years since the passage of the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law which is limited to the workplace and to superior-subordinate relationships,” she said. The bill will address women's security in public spaces. Quezon City data showed three in five women have experienced street harassment while a report from Social Weather Station said nine out of 10 women from 18-24 years old experienced different forms of sexual harassment in the streets. Hontiveros added her office has been receiving incident reports of harassment from as young as elementary-level students and that these unwanted comments are not compliments. \"One may think it is a compliment to catcall, or to leer, but such unwanted comments, gestures and actions forced on a person in a public space is actually sexist and offensive.\" She said harassment affects a person's capacity to perform in education, work and society in general. Under the bill, violators can be jailed from one to six months and depending on severity and a fine of P10,000. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and local units of the Philippine National Police would be granted authority to apprehend perpetrators.
