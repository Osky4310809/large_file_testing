Bush halted the “travel ban” nationwide, effective immediately. \nNow, the Trump administration just fired back by filing an appeal. \nFrom NBC News : \nThe Trump administration on Saturday filed a notice of appeal indicating it intends to challenge a federal judge’s ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order that temporarily blocked entry to the U.S. of those from seven predominantly Muslim nations. \nThe notice was filed in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Washington. It comes a day after a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the Trump travel restrictions. \nThe notice is not the appeal itself. The White House press secretary on Friday said the administration would seek an emergency stay against Judge James L. Robart’s restraining order, and defended the travel restrictions as legal. \nWell, this likely isn’t the end of this “Muslim Ban” situation. \n(It’s not a Muslim ban, to be clear. If it were, more than seven Muslim-majority nations would be “banned.” It just so happens that radical Islam has a firm grip in the seven barred nations.) \nStay tuned for further updates. \nIf 45’s first two weeks in office are any indication, it’s going to be a crazy four years.
