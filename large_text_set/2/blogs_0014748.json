Brown joining Chadwick Boseman’s superhero king in the fictional country of Wakanda, but one established Marvel actor is a little disappointed that he hasn’t gotten a call. Speaking with We Got This Covered , Samuel L. Jackson suggested that he thinks Marvel isn’t using him quite as often as it should, which is to say that he (rightfully) thinks he should be in basically every Marvel movie. Jackson’s Nick Fury last appeared in Avengers: Age Of Ultron and probably won’t show up again until Avengers: Infinity War , but he was really hoping he’d get a chance to meet the Black Panther: \nI asked them, “So you’re doing Black Panther and the only black character in the Marvel Universe is not showing up?” And they’re like, “Nick Fury is not in Wakanda!” How can he not know the other black superhero on the planet? How the hell does that work? But they just said, “No you’re not in that one.” \nOf course, Jackson’s Nick Fury isn’t actually the only black character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though the fact that you can probably count the others on one hand pretty much proves his point anyway. Also, considering how important Jackson’s character is to the MCU, you’d think Marvel would do anything to keep him happy, but apparently we’ll have to wait until later for Nick Fury to finally get a chance to meet the Black Panther. \nThat stuff aside, Jackson thinks he might be in the Captain Marvel movie and mentioned that he’d also like a solo Nick Fury spin-off, but both of those points are far from any kind of confirmation. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:19:35.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
