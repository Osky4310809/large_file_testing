MacPherson, following Howard Lovecraft and the Frozen Wastelands . The stories blend fact and fiction, creating a narrative from moments in the author H.P. Lovecraft ’s life and mixing it with aspects of his fiction, including meeting his own famed and horrific creations such as Cthulhu. \nHamill joins legendary actor Christopher Plummer and the former Hellraiser Doug Bradley in the animated picture from Shout! Factory and Arcana. Horror and animation voice-over actor Jeffrey Combs also joining the cast. \nHamill has been cast as Dr. Henry Armitage and Combs as King Abdul, joining Plummer and Bradley who reprise their roles from the first film as Dr. Herbert West and Nyarlathotep respectively. \nThe film is expected to be released later in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T19:34:39.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
