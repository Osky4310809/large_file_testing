The San Miguel Beermen escape Barangay Ginebra San Miguel for their sixth straight win.   (UPDATED) – Alex Cabagnot dropped 16 points and two-time defending champions San Miguel Beermen shook off the pesky Barangay Ginebra San Miguel, 72-70,   Cup on Sunday, January 8 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. \nRonald Tubid added 12 points and 3 rebounds while Arwind Santos had 10 markers and 12 boards   was more a show of defensive force between two offensive-oriented teams. \n\"I know from the start that this will be a tight game for us because I think the energy has gone down since our last game against Blackwater and then coming off a break,\" said coach Leo Austria. \n\"I'm really proud of the team because they fought hard from the start. They refused to lose.\" \nThe Beermen pulled away from just a two-point lead early in the fourth quarter for a 9-point cushion but had to steel themselves against the Gin Kings' last-ditch rally, coming to within 72-70 inside the final minute after an LA Tenorio three-pointer. \nSantos displayed his offensive rebounding prowess to preserve 3 straight crucial possessions for San Miguel, preventing Ginebra from capitalizing for a tie or the lead. \n\"Ever since that's been Arwind Santos' trademark, his offensive rebounding,\" Austria praised Santos. \nThe door stayed open, however, after Marcio Lassiter blew an opportunity to ice the game with a pair of missed free throws with 12.5 seconds remaining and up by just two. But Ginebra was unable to send the game into overtime as Tenorio's floater in a play designed for him off a timeout missed its mark. \nThe Beermen survived their sister team with   scoring just   Though he still tracked down 11 rebounds and had two steals and 3 blocks. \n\"The reason why this has been a very low-scoring game is we know ever since that any team coach Tim (Cone) handles, his offense is deliberate and they pick their shots. Possessions are limited. We're both defending hard,\" noted Austria. \nJapeth Aguilar led Ginebra with 17 points, 11 rebounds, and two blocks while Sol Mercado added 11 points and 6 rebounds. Tenorio finished with 8 markers and 4 dimes. \nSan Miguel won its sixth straight game for a 7-1 record atop the standings while Ginebra dropped to 3-4. \nScores : San Miguel (72) : Cabagnot 16, Tubid 12, Santos 10, Fajardo 9, Lassiter 7, Espinas 7, De Ocampo 5, Ross 4, Garcia 2, Heruela 0.
