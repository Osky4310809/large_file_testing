Mark Henle/azcentral.com Supporters hold signs on Jan. 26, 2017, at the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix, before a hearing on a bill in honor of Joe Smith, a Phoenix teen killed in a semi crash. Supporters include Gabrielle Bell (second from right), who was Joe's girlfriend. (Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic) \nA bill in honor of Joe Smith, a recent Phoenix Horizon High School graduate who was killed in a horrific crash on Interstate 10 in June, is one step closer to becoming law. \nA state Senate committee unanimously voted Thursday in support of Senate Bill 1054, also known as \"Joe's Law,\" which would make it mandatory for law enforcement to give drug and alcohol testing to anyone who caused a traffic accident resulting in death or serious injury. \nAs it stands, Arizona law says officers may require drivers to submit to blood-alcohol testing or drug testing. Individual police agencies, however, can set their own policies. \n\"It’s nothing anybody thinks about because they think it’s already required, but when you lose your son, you think about it,\" Joe's father, Steve Smith, said while standing outside the Arizona Capitol on Thursday morning, where about 100 people gathered to show support. x Share Steve and Tana Smith talk about the death of their son Joe and the subsequent investigation that led to no charges being filed against he driver of the semitruck that struck the car in which Joe was a passanger. David Kadlubowski/azcentral.com \nFriends held up signs bearing Joe's senior portrait outside the Senate building, while about 20 people went inside to see Joe's mother, Tana, testify in the bill's first hearing. \n\"It is our greatest hope that the legislation before you will be the help so many grieving families need as they, too, search for answers from disasters similar to ours,\" she told the state Senate's Judiciary Committee.

(Photo: Special for The Republic) \nJoe and three of his best friends were returning June 17 from a graduation trip to California when, while stopped on Interstate 10 near Quartzsite for heavy traffic, a semi driver plowed into them and another car, killing two and severely injuring four . \nThe 42-year-old semi driver said he was tired and appeared to be so, records show, and troopers did not test him for drugs or alcohol. \n\"It is the not knowing that is the hardest part to accept,\" Tana Smith told the committee before presenting a stack of petitions she said had 3,191 signatures in favor of the bill . \nHer account brought Sen. Lupe Contreras to tears. Contreras, D-District 19, was in an accident as a kid that killed his 18-year-old sister and said he knows the pain a family endures. \n\"It’s so important to have healing in a family, and I think this is one way that we, as a state, can move forward and help families come together and feel that justice is there for them,\" said Sen. Judy Burges, R-District 22, who chairs the committee and is the prime sponsor of the bill. \nThe committee voted unanimously to recommend that the bill move on. The bill still needs a full Senate vote before going to the House of Representatives.

There’s not a moment I don’t think about him. \n\"If we could help another family from ever having to go through that, that’s healing for us. That’s all we can ask for. We needed this. We need this.\" \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T03:58:57.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
