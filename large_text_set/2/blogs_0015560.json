the Commander, 79 Composite group of the Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Charles Oho; the Borno State Commissioner of Police, Damian Chukwu; the Garrison Commander, 7 Division of the Army, Brigadier General Jibrin Mohammed; the State Director of the DSS, Suleiman Kankia; Commandant of the Nigerian Civil Defense Corps, Ibrahim Abdullahi; the Secretary to the State Government, Usman Jidda Shuwa, the Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice, Kaka Shehu Lawan and the Permanent Secretary in charge of security. \nAt the end of meeting, new guard locations were established in some routes across the state to curtail the movement of remnants of Boko Haram fighters; deployment of security personnel to various locations were increased with more members of Civilian JTF (youth volunteers involved) while the Governor gave approval for release of additional patrol vehicles to security agencies for increased surveillance. \nThe governor also approved logistics to compliment efforts of the Federal Government in strengthening armed forces while measures were adopted to strengthen the Civilian JTF and hunters. \nThe meeting also reviewed synergy between armed forces and volunteers with steps adopted to increase collaboration and clamp down on cattle rustling used by insurgents to raise funds. The council deliberated on recent false information spread by mischief makers to cause disaffection between armed forces and volunteers particularly the Civilian JTF with the council warning mischief makers against destabilizing the emerging peace across the State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:01:59.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
