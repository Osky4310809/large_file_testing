Many other cameras were recording this particular event. \nRyan Reynolds, who plays Marvel's Deadpool , lost the Best Actor award to Ryan Gosling, and the latter went up to receive the award. When Gosling approached the stage, Reynolds was seen sharing a passioniate kiss with former Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield. \nReynolds' wife Blake Lively watched on with laughter, and the two actors became the talk of the evening. \nWhile appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , the host asked Garfield about the kiss. The actor chuckled and said he just wanted to support his friend. \"I just wanted Ryan to know that I loved him, whether he won or lost.\" Garfield continued, \" He showed up, he gave his all - it doesnâ€™t change anything in my heart.\" UP NEXT: Deadpool 2 Will Have A Lot Of Characters After the comment, Garfield mentioned that he had no problem kissing other men. Slowly, Colbert moved in, telling the actor that he didn't either. The two performers then shared a kiss that blew Ryan Reynolds' out of the water. It was a hilarious moment on The Late Show, and the saga of Garfield's Kiss-Gate continued.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T04:15:42.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
