Durkin | 12:46   \nMoments ago, a CNN spokesperson released a statement on behalf of the network in direct contrast with a controversial story published by Buzzfeed Tuesday. CNN releases statement differentiating itself from BuzzFeed’s reporting on Trump-Russia: pic.twitter.com/0Tu4e23qtZ \n— ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) January 11, 2017 \n“CNN’s decision to publish carefully sourced reporting about the operation of our government is vastly different than Buzzfeed’s decision to publish unsubstantiated memos. The Trump team knows this,” reads the statement in part. \nIn a breaking news report Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. EST , the CNN report noted that both Trump and President Barack Obama — as well as eight ranking members of Congress — had been briefed regarding potentially “compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.” The report indicated that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers all briefed the POTUS and PEOTUS alike on the allegations; CNN further identified that a two-page synopsis further indicated exchanges between Trump surrogates and Kremlin officials. A subsequent BuzzFeed story released the 35-page document in question, joined by a disclaimer of sorts by the media giant: while they may be explosive, the claims are “unverified.” \nEarlier today, CNN’s Jake Tapper — who co-authored the original CNN report in question with Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, and Carl Bernstein — distanced their work from that of the BuzzFeed leak. While he noted that the CNN report was appropriate and well within the bounds of journalistic ethics, he slammed the 35-page leak as an, “irresponsible posting of [an] uncorroborated 35-pager.” \nHave a tip we should know?
