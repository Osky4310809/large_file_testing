If they are destroying the equipment installed, why are they destroying the fence? \n“I have documents for the work being done here and it was inspected and certified fit by agencies like the DPR, Fire Service, Town Planning Authority, Surveyor General’s office and other relevant agencies of government and I paid the required fees and have the receipts. \n“After the January 8 fire incident at Strive Energy, he (Fayose) ordered that we stop work and I complied and dialogue has been going on. The Ewi of Ado and the Commissioner of Police called us yesterday (Tuesday). \n“I was at the Ewi’s palace after the king had ordered us to call off our strike with the Commissioner of Police and other stakeholders in attendance. Between 3:30 and 4:00pm yesterday (Tuesday), the governor was here in shorts, giving orders to trucks from the state Ministry of Works to demolish my structure.” \nOguntuase maintained that the action was politically motivated because he was a member of the APC. \nHe said, “Even the petrol station that was burnt which he claimed was the reason why he is carrying out this demolition was not demolished; the burnt station is still intact but the question I want to ask is why is he starting this latest exercise from my station again? \n“Another reason why I believe Fayose’s action was political was that during the January 8 fire incident at Ijigbo, my father’s house and another APC chieftain, Alhaji Olatunji’s father’s house were affected by fire but the governor went ahead to demolish the two structures without our consent and without paying any compensation.” \nCopyright PUNCH.
