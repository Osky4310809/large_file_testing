FA Chairman condemns England fans (Photo: Jordan Mansfield) \nHe said: “The behaviour of a section of the England support in Dortmund was inappropriate, disrespectful and disappointing.” \nThe taunts from fans came on the day when London was hit by a terror attack and could be heard by the live eight million TV audience on ITV. \nClarke added: “The FA has consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others.
