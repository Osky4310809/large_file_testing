If I couldn’t save my brother, I would like to save yours. I would like to save your mother and your father, your brother and your sister. The passion on my end is matched by the officers that I work with. We can’t wait to start working.” \nThe program will be a three-year pilot in the west side of downtown. Officials say at least 60 people are expected to be served by the program at any given time. \nBaltimore City Health Commissioner Leana Wen says it’s important to treat addiction as a chronic disease and not a moral failing. Baltimore City is the 6th U.S. City to use the LEAD program. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook \n(TM and Copyright 2017 CBS and its relevant subsidiaries.
