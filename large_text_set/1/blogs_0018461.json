It’s just crazy to look back on that moment where we were both just songwriters, solely, and that song has held so much weight over the years. The meaning behind the song actually means more now to me and Ryan, in a weird way — years later, it sort of hit us what the song meant.”\nIndeed, the pair didn’t reveal they’d begun dating until last year. But their creative history laid the groundwork for their relationship.\n“We had been friends for only a couple of years, but there was always this writing chemistry in the room, and eventually, the timing of it was undeniable. We had such a foundation built off writing so many songs over the years that we were like, ‘Why are we avoiding this?'” Morris says.\nFor more on Maren Morris, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands everywhere Friday. Since they met, both Morris and Hurd have evolved from songwriters behind the scenes to recording artists . Morris’ hit “My Church” and breakthrough album Hero helped her secure four 2017 Grammy nominations — including Best New Artist — and Hurd, 30, released the music video for his new single “Hold You Back” on Wednesday.\n“It’s been amazing to go through this very crazy journey with someone at the same pace and lean on each other through all of those sometimes scary moments,” says Morris, who will embark on her first headlining tour on Feb. 2.

But the upside is that you get to grow with someone,” she says. “You need someone there that gets what you’re going through. I’m lucky that he does.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T03:41:11.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
