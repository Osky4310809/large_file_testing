He added that the Netherlands has lost Turkey’s friendship amid a deepening crisis in ties. \nAddressing a rally in the northwestern Turkish province of Sakarya on Thursday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed his discontent with a Tuesday ruling by the European Court of Justice, which states that Islamic headscarves can be banned by employers as part of a general policy barring all religious and political symbols. \n\"Shame on the EU. Down with your European principles, values and justice...they started a clash between the cross and the crescent, there is no other explanation,\" he said, as quoted by Reuters.
