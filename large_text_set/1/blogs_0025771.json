PBA IMAGES \nMalaysia made history by being the first Foreign-based team to join the PBA D-League. \nFor the second straight conference, Malaysians have made the trek to the country hoping to catch the same love the Philippines has for the sport. \nPlaying under the banner of Blustar Detergent, the Malaysians have been competing among some of the hungry and hopeful Filipino ballers in the developmental league. ADVERTISEMENT \nBut this guest team is lot different from the squad which saw action last year, with only three ballers—Ong Wei Yong, Liaw Chee Huei, and Mak Long Seng—staying behind for the 2017 PBA Aspirants’ Cup. \n“This is a young team, different from the one which played last year. The level is really different for us. So what were trying to do here is to expose these players on how basketball is played,” said coach Lee Kheng Tian. “There’s still a lot of things we need to improve on, but we hope that we’ll see improvements as the tournament goes.” \nDevelopment is the main focus for the Malaysians, with the B-squad of its national team aged 18 to 29 all represented in the squad. \nThough Blustar had a poor start after a 51-point loss to Racal, 109-58, in their season-opener last January 21, the Dragons quickly adapted, pushing Jose Rizal U to its limit before bowing, 75-64, the following day. \n“We’re willing to take these losses as long as the players are learning,” said \nThe Malaysians aren’t really left without any help in understanding Filipino basketball as they enlisted coach Britt Reroma’s services. \nReroma, who had been in the sidelines for San Beda, University of San Carlos, and Don Bosco College, has been tasked in helping the Dragons adapt to the Philippine style of play as they seek to compete in regional basketball tournaments in the long run. \n“The reason why these Malaysians joined the D-League is because the Philippines is the number one in basketball in Southeast Asia. They want to feel the Philippine type of basketball so they could feel how the game is really played,” he said. Blustar Detergent from Malaysia. PBA IMAGES \nReroma also shared that though expectations aren’t high for Blustar, they want to give these players all the exposure they need. \n“The purpose of joining the D-League is for them learn and be better, so that when they go back in Malaysia and face their Southeast Asian neighbors, they will have learned a lot from us Filipinos,” he said. \nIt would also mean a lot if these Malaysians imbibe the same passion the Filipinos have for the sport of basketball, something which Reroma said will be valuable if the country wants to improve its standing in the Southeast Asian region. \n“Their goal is to improve their basketball approach. Basketball isn’t really the number one sport in Malaysia, so the good thing about this is when they return to their country, they’ve already understood the game,” he said. \n“We want them to realize how big basketball is here, so when they go back, they will take the games to the heart.” \nBlustar Detergent returns to action next Tuesday against Cafe France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:26:46.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
