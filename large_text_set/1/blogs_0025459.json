We are the voice, we are the face of America,” he said, according to PEOPLE . \n“Our America is big, it is free, and it is open to dreamers of all races, all countries, all religions. Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump. And I want to specifically tonight reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that.” “Our America is big, it is free, and it is open to dreamers of all races, all countries, all religions,” John Legend said at the Producers Guild Awards Saturday night.
