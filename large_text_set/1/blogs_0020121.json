And Trump’s press secretary killed it \nSean Spicer’s remarks, full of falsehoods, should inspire journalists to dig into what matters  09   US White House press secretary Sean Spicer held his first official briefing with the media in the White House on Saturday Andrew Harnik/AP \nThe presidency is not a reality show, but President Trump on his first full day in office made clear that he’s still obsessed with being what he once proudly called “a ratings machine.” \nHe cares enough about it to send his press secretary, Sean Spicer , out to brazenly lie to the media in his first official briefing. \n“This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration - period - both in person and around the globe,” Spicer said. And he added a scolding about widespread reports that differ from his evidence-free assessment: “These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.” \nCrowd size experts estimate Trump’s audience at far fewer than the million or more that Trump is claiming, and at far less than the size of the following day’s women’s march, which the new president has said little about. And side-by-side photographs showed the contrast between the comparatively thin gathering for Trump’s inauguration and the record-setting one in 2009 for former president Barack Obama’s first. \nAri Fleischer, a former George W. Bush press secretary, saw Saturday’s bizarre session for what it was. \n“This is called a statement you’re told to make by the President. And you know the President is watching,” Fleischer wrote. (MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski pegged it as “Sean Spicer’s first hostage video.”) \nThe mainstream media, including The Washington Post , appropriately made clear note of the falsehoods about crowd size. The New York Times called out “false claims” in a prominent headline, and many broadcast journalists challenged Spicer immediately - although they didn’t get a chance to do so to his face, since he took no questions. \nCNN wisely chose not to air the briefing in full, but to report on it and to show parts, providing context. Fox News showed it in its full glory, infomercial style. \nSome journalists, afterward, sounded stunned at what had transpired. \n“Astonishing,” said Jim Acosta of CNN. “Jaw meet floor” was the reaction of Glenn Thrush of The New York Times . \nThe reaction is understandable. Some semblance of truth from the White House ought to be reasonable enough, especially on Day Two. \nBut nothing about this should shock. \nAnyone - citizen or journalist - who is surprised by false claims from the new inhabitant of the Oval Office hasn’t been paying attention. That was reinforced when Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told Meet the Press Sunday that Spicer had been providing “alternative facts” to what the media had reported, making it clear we’ve gone full Orwell. \nOfficial words do matter, but they shouldn’t be what news organisations pay most attention to, as they try to present the truth about a new administration. \nWhite House press briefings are “access journalism,” in which official statements - achieved by closeness to the source - are taken at face value and breathlessly reported as news. And that is over. Dead. \nSpicer’s statement should be seen for what it is: Remarks made over the casket at the funeral of access journalism. \nAs Jessica Huseman of ProPublica put it: “Journalists aren’t going to get answers from Spicer. We are going to get answers by digging. By getting our hands dirty. So let’s all do that.” \nShe’s right. So was Tim O’Brien, executive editor of Bloomberg View and a Trump biographer, who urged journalists to remember that the White House briefing room is “spoon-feeding and Trump is a habitual fabulist.” \nThere’s a deeper story here, beyond a single briefing, no matter how memorable. Saturday made clearer than ever that President Trump intends to make the American media his foremost enemy. \nDuring his first official visit to the CIA, Trump once again attacked the media, as he did throughout the campaign as he blacklisted news organisations and called reporters “scum.” \nJournalists shouldn’t rise to the bait and decide to treat Trump as an enemy. Recalling at all times that their mission is truth-telling and holding public officials accountable, they should dig in, paying far more attention to actions than to sensational tweets or briefing-room lies - while still being willing to call out falsehoods clearly when they happen. \nThey also should quickly acknowledge and correct their own inevitable errors, as Time’s Zeke Miller did - multiple times and with an apology - after erroneously reporting that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. \nThat didn’t keep the president from making Miller’s reporting error a major issue as he raged during his CIA visit: “This is how dishonest the media is.” In pictures: Women of the world march against Trump In pictures: Women of the world march against Trump 1/32 London \nAn image of President Donald Trump is seen on a placard during the Women's March in London, England Getty 2/32 Sydney \nA view of the skywriting word reading 'Trump' as thousands rally in support of equal rights in Sydney, New South Wales EPA 3/32 Rome \nPeople shout and hold signs during a rally against US newly sworn-in President Donald Trump in Rome Getty Images \nA protester holds a placard during the Women's March in London, England Getty Images 5/32 Marseille \nA placard ready 'Pussy grabs back' is attached to the handle bar of a bike during a 'Women's March' organized by Feminist and human rights groups in solidarity with women marching in Washington and around the world for their rights and against the reactionary politics of the newly sworn-in US President Donald Trump, at the Old Port (Vieux Port) of Marseille, southern France Getty Images 6/32 Bangkok \nA young Thai girl holds a \"women's rights are human rights\" sign at Roadhouse BBQ restaurant where many of the Bangkok Womens March participants gathered in Bangkok, Thailand Getty Images 7/32 Bangkok \nA Thai woman takes a photo of a \"hate is not great\" sign at the women's solidarity gathering in Bangkok, Thailand Getty Images 8/32 Bangkok \nAmerican expats and travellers gather with the international community in Bangkok at the Roadhouse BBQ restaurant to stand in solidarity in Bangkok, Thailand Getty Images 9/32 London \nProtetesters gather outside The US Embassy in Grosvenor Square ahead of the Women's March in London, England Getty Images \nWomen's March at the Old Port (Vieux Port) of Marseille, southern France Getty Images 11/32 Marseille \nProtestors hold placards reading 'My body my choice, my vote my voice' during a 'Women's March' organized by Feminist and human rights groups in solidarity with women marching in Washington and around the world for their rights and against the reactionary politics of the newly sworn-in US President Donald Trump, at the Old Port (Vieux Port) of Marseille, southern France Getty Images 12/32 Rome \nA person holds a sign during a rally against US newly sworn-in President Donald Trump in Rome Getty Images 13/32 Kolkata \nActivist Sarah Annay Williamson holds a placard and shouts slogan during the Women's March rally in Kolkata, India AP \nActivists participate in the Women's March rally in Kolkata, India AP 15/32 London \nA Women's March placards are rested on a bench outside the US Embassy in Grosvenor Square ahead of the Women's March in London, England Getty Images \nA women carries her placard ahead of the Women's March in London, England Getty Images 17/32 Manila \nWomen protesters shout slogans while displaying placards during a rally in solidarity against the inauguration of President Donald Trump, in suburban Quezon city, northeast of Manila, Philippines AP 18/32 Berlin \nProtesters attend a 'Berlin Women's March on Washington' demonstration in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany AP 19/32 Berlin \nProtesters attend a 'Berlin Women's March on Washington' demonstration in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany AP 20/32 Berlin \nProtesters attend a 'Berlin Women's March on Washington' demonstration in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany AP 21/32 Melbourne \nProtesters take part in the Melbourne rally to protest against the Trump Inauguration in Melbourne, Australia Getty Images \nProtesters take part in the Women's March rally in Macau Getty Images 23/32 Melbourne \nWomens march on Melbourne protestors marching during a rally where rights groups marched in solidarity with Americans to speak out against misogyny, bigotry and hatred Rex \nProtesters hold placards as they take part at the Women's March rally in Macau Getty Images 25/32 Macau \nProtesters hold placards as they take part at the Women's March rally in Macau, Macau.
