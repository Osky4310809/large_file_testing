WATCH: New ISIS Video Shows Religious Police & Militants at Work in Raqqa, Syria Published Updated 11:39 am EDT, February 6, 2017 9 Comments By Heavy Terror Watch 26.4k Share Tweet Follow \nIn a new video purportedly released by the Islamic State titled “The Structure Bricks,” ISIS religious police known as “hisbah” are shown carrying out duties in Raqqa while militants head to battle. \nRaqqa is the “terrorist capital” of the Islamic State. The city is located on the northeast bank of the Euphrates River, nearly 100 miles east of Aleppo. ISIS took control of the city on January 13, 2014. After taking control, ISIS began a genocidal campaign against the city’s Shia Alawites, suspected supporters of Bashar al-Assad, and Christians, reports Asia News. \nISIS then converted the Armenian Catholic Church of the Martyrs into its headquarters. According to World Magazine , ISIS militants entered the Armenian church, burned the furnishings inside, and destroyed a cross atop its clock tower, before replacing it with the Islamist group’s “black flag.” \nThe city has since become a prison of sorts for its civilians, unable to leave without permission and forced to live under brutal, ISIS sharia law while subjected to nearly nonstop coalition airstrikes. \nISIS calls its religious police “hisbah.” Hisbah is short for “rijaal al-hisbah” and translates to “men who guard against infringements.” “Infringements” in this context refers to anything seen as non-Islamic by sharia law interpretation. \nAccording to the Learn to Read the Quran , hisbah police duties includes the monitoring of: \n1- Free mixing of the sexes and wanton display of beauty (tabarruj) which are forbidden according [to sharia.] 2- Imitation of either of the sexes by the other. 3- Men making approaches to women either verbally or by their actions. 4- Profane, obscene or indecent speech. 5- Playing radios, TVs or recorders etc. near mosques or in such a way as to disturb the worshippers. 6- Non-Muslims openly manifesting their beliefs or the symbols of their religion, or showing disrespect towards the symbols and rulings of Islam. 7- Displaying or selling pictures, books or video or audio recordings which go against Islamic etiquette or Islamic beliefs. 8- Displaying 3-D or promiscuous images, or the symbols of non-Islamic religions such as the cross, the star of David, images of the Buddha, and the like. 9- Manufacturing or promoting or trading in intoxicants. 10- Means that lead to immoral actions such as adultery, homosexuality and gambling, or running houses and places where evil and immoral actions may be committed. 11- Manifest bid’ah (innovation), such as venerating certain times and places for which there is no sanction in sharee’ah, or celebrating innovated, un-Islamic festivals and occasions. 12- Practising witchcraft, magic and trickery in order to consume people’s wealth unlawfully. 13- Cheating in weights and measures. \nIn the video, the hisbah are shown patrolling the shops and streets of Raqqa. It ends with showing ISIS militants gearing up to fight. The title of the film, “The Structure Bricks,” might refer to the hisbah and the militants as the “structures” that support Raqqa. \nRaqqa is currently in the crosshairs of several powers involved in the Syrian Civil War. According to Reuters , “An alliance of U.S.-backed militias started a new phase of its campaign against the Islamic State-held city of Raqqa on Saturday… The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said in a statement the action was being undertaken with ‘increasing support from the (U.S.-led) international coalition forces’ through both air strikes and backing from coalition special forces on the ground.” \nHowever, the retaking of Raqqa is currently subject to American bipartisanship, as President Donald Trump announced that he plans to scrap former President Obama’s “months-old plan” to capture the city, reports The Independent. \nCurrent rumors speculate that Trump may team up with Russia and Damascus on the ground to liberate the city. \nFind more ISIS news, photos and videos here. \nHeavy is an independent news organization.
