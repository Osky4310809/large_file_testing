Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDidi Hamann has revealed that he would prefer to play for Everton ’s ‘Mr Cool’ Ronald Koeman, rather than Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. \nThe Champions League winner admits he rates both men but that his personality would better suit the Toffees chief, report the Liverpool Echo. \nThe pair will meet in Saturday’s 228th Merseyside derby and Hamann insists Klopp's exuberance would have been too much for him. \n“I’ve got to say I like both managers, but you probably couldn’t have two more different characters than them two. \n“Klopp is very outgoing, very enthusiastic and very passionate about things, while Ronald Koeman is Mr Cool.

He had a bit of a rough time when he first came here as things weren’t going too well, but the Everton boss kept his calm.” \nHamann also believes that Koeman’s personality has given Everton a “serious chance” of finishing above their rivals in the Premier League.

I know people say ‘there’s a lot at stake’ and ‘it’s a derby game’, but it’s really a crunch match this time around.” \nHe went on: “If you’d have told Everton fans at the start of the season that they could finish ahead of Liverpool, they’d have jumped at that. It’s a real possibility now. \n“What Koeman’s done with The Toffees this season is simply outstanding. No wonder he’s been linked with the Barcelona job recently, he’d be tailor made for it. \n“He was a massive player there, he’s well respected all around Europe and probably even more so in Barca. He’s also won the European Cup with them, need I say more?
