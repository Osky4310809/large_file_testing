Conway, Bannon, and Priebus \nThe whole cadre of White House deplorables—Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Kellyanne Conway, and Mick Mulvaney—just finished meeting with House Republicans and the message was clear. Popular vote loser Donald Trump is over all this. He is demanding they vote Friday and if they don't vote Friday, it's over. x — John Bresnahan (@BresPolitico) March 23, 2017 \nWhat are they voting on? Who knows!?!?! Trump certainly doesn’t care. He’s just tired of this, he doesn’t want to have to talk to these losers anymore and he certainly doesn’t want to lose his weekend, so just do something. \nLet's make this failure complete. There could still be a vote tomorrow. Even if you already called your member of Congress, do it again by calling the Capitol Hill switchboard at (202) 224-3121. Jam the phone lines, urge them to vote NO. \nMore—“EHB” repeal here is the essential health benefits—hospitalization, maternity care, prescription drug coverage, etc,--everything that makes having insurance actually insurance. x", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:17:31.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
