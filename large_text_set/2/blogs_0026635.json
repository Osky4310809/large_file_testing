People who know me from the locker room know that I train very hard. \n“I’m a lion and I will stop on top. I will not play one game by being Ibrahimovic and for what I did before. If I don’t perform, if I don’t bring results, I will not play. \n“I will not be like other players, playing because they make a great career and name and they are still playing because they are who they are. I will play as long as I can bring results.” \nIbrahimovic is inspiring United’s current crop of young players such as Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard, in much the same way Cantona did for the Class of ‘92 that included David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. Ibrahimovic is now setting the standards for the likes of Anthony Martial (Photo: REUTERS) \nThose former United stars have all paid tribute to the influence of Cantona, whose fierce work ethic and will to win rubbed off on all of them and made them better players. \nIbrahimovic is the same, his talent matched by a hunger and desire on the training field that is leaving an indelible mark on United’s next generation. \n“I’m from the old school where they work hard and get what they get from doing the hard work, not like the new school where it’s easy to get what you want,” said Ibrahimovic. “I have an objective every season and to reach that objective I need to train hard and I need to suffer when I train. \n“In my head, I’m never satisfied - I always want more, I’m hungry to do more. That’s my mentality. I’m not satisfied with what I’m doing – I always want more. The Swede's first season in English football has brought the Community Shield...

I’ve been in five different countries, I’ve been in the best clubs in the world and I’m repeating, every year, what I’m doing. This is another chapter in my career.” \nIbrahimovic has certainly vindicated the decision to come to England so late in his career, after glittering spells at Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. \nBut he admitted he could have been playing elsewhere had United boss Jose Mourinho – who managed him at Inter - not called and persuaded him to join him in Manchester. \n“In your career, you have moments,” said Ibrahimovic.
