And not just any singing — a duet between Mandy Moore and Chrissy Metz . We know that they both have beautiful voices, and the season finale of the show is making us realize that more beautiful songs are likely in our future.\nA mini spoiler (but a spoiler, nonetheless) to follow: In the season finale of This Is Us , Metz’s character Kate Pearson made the revelation that she wanted to be a singer . Sound familiar? Well, it should. It was also the dream of her mother, Rebecca, played by Moore.\n \nSince the relationship between the two is a little stunted (for reasons we’re only partially aware of) perhaps this can bring the two together during next season.\nWhat we know for a fact is that both Chrissy Metz and Mandy Moore would be all about this storyline. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight this Saturday, Moore seemed really excited about the possibility of a duet. The video, which you can watch below, is simply adorable.\n“I’m so ready,” Moore said. “That would be a thrill. I love Chrissy, and her voice is just bananas it’s so good.” Moore also mentioned that she’d definitely push the writers to include it. (And really, why shouldn’t they? It’d be an incredibly interesting plot that can go a bunch of different ways.)\nSince Moore was a successful pop singer before she was an actress, it’s definitely a high compliment. And, we have to agree — fans got to hear Metz belt out a tune earlier this season, and it was phenomenal.\nThe possible storyline was mentioned to Metz, and she’s also on board.\n“That would be so fun,” Metz said with enthusiasm. “Chrissy’s dream true. Yeah. That would be so, so much fun.” Now it’s just a question as to which song they’d choose!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:19:24.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
