Because even though I’ve been a Christian for almost 30 years, there are still things I don’t remember hearing from the pulpit. \nWhat about you? What topics would you choose? Would you focus on all of the serious issues that make people squirm? Or, would you like to hear peaceful sermons that make people happy inside? \nMy choices are probably somewhere in between, but take a look to see the top 10 sermon topics I’d like to hear before I die. Start Slideshow 1. Were Adam and Eve created with physical flaws? \nMy husband and I joke about Eve being created with hairy legs and even some cellulite. (It must be true, right?) But all joking aside, were Adam and Eve created with physical flaws? \nBecause God’s original intent for them was to live in complete unity with Him, in a picture-perfect paradise, we assume they were created perfectly. A sermon about this would not only be interesting, it might clear up some of our presuppositions! 2. Why is Satan allowed to tempt believers? \nI feel like I’ve heard bits and pieces about this subject, but still find myself wondering why the enemy is allowed to wreak havoc in the lives of believers. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to know that upon acceptance of Christ, the devil would never get to bother us again? \nI’d really like to hear a sermon that addresses Satan’s role in the Christian life. 3. Is God's wrath still seen today? \nWhen I read parts of the Old Testament, I sometimes cringe a little. I think it’s because I know with all my heart that God is loving, kind, and good. But what about His wrathful side? Does He show His wrath today? If so, what exactly does that look like? \nI would love to hear a biblically sound sermon about the wrath of God—one that explains how our perfect, loving Creator displays His righteous anger in justice and in truth. 4. How far does God's grace go? \nI’ve often wondered about the extent of God’s grace. It’s not that I want to test Him in it, but I want to know how wide, how deep, and how far His grace goes. \nI think a sermon that would explore this beautiful attribute of God would be cherished and valuable to many Christians today. 5. Can people lose their salvation? \nThis may be one of those topics that’s been pounded into the ground, but I’d really like to hear a message that specifically addresses people who once believed in Jesus, but have chosen to walk away. \nI firmly believe that nothing in the heavens above or on the earth below can separate us from the love of Christ. (Romans 8:38-39) But what happens when a former believer rejects Christ’s love altogether? 6. What are some the key differences between cults? \nFor some reason, I am fascinated by the inner workings of cults! It has always been interesting to me how millions of people can follow such strange and seemingly hopeless beliefs. \nAn informative sermon that outlined the differences between the major cults, by comparing them, and giving historical details, would be a very intriguing sermon to hear! 7. Why does God let children suffer? \nThis is an age-old topic, and one that has been very difficult for a lot of people. Still, I’d like to hear a truthful message on this, and hopefully one that would clear up a lot of misconceptions. \nHow can a loving God allow children to suffer? If He is able to prevent it, why doesn’t He? These would be valuable questions to have answered from the pulpit. 8. Will the rapture of the church really happen? \nI truly want to believe that the church will be raptured before the tribulation, but is that just wishful thinking? What about the theories that say we will have to endure part of the tribulation, or heaven forbid, all of it? \nA doctrinally sound sermon on this topic would be wonderful to hear, as each day we grow closer to Jesus’ return. 9. Does God really care about our physical health? \nThe lazy side of me would like to believe that as long as we are spiritually strong, we don’t need to be concerned with our physical health. But deep down, I know that’s not the case. \nA sermon on this topic would not only be insightful, it would hopefully motivate us to take better care of the bodies we’ve been given. 10. What is heaven really like? \nSince we are going to spend eternity in heaven, I think it would be wonderful to have a detailed picture of it in our minds. \nI would love to hear a sermon that lists all of heaven’s biblical descriptions and builds the anticipation for eternity with Christ! \n\nJennifer Waddle is best known for offering Biblical encouragement for women in the trenches of life.
