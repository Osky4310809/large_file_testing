Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nHoward Webb says Joey Barton could face a suspension for \"putting nails in the face\" of a Lincoln City player in Burnley's FA Cup fifth round defeat. \nThe Clarets midfielder was involved in a couple of controversial moments as the conference outfit beat the Premier League side 1-0 at Turf Moor. \nIn the second half, Barton appeared to scratch the face of Terry Hawkridge as the two players came together following a challenge for the ball. \nThe 34-year-old was booked for his part in the clash, but replays appeared to show the 34-year-old digging his nails into the Lincoln winger's face, suggesting he was lucky to see yellow.

He puts his hand out to Hawkridge. When you see it again, he puts his nails into his face.\" \nThe former Premier League referee also spoke about the retrospective action Barton may be hit with as a result of the incident, and suggested he could be suspended. \nThis was not the only controversial moment from the match involving Barton.

Fortunately nothing came of the incident. \nBarton took to Twitter after the game to attempt to explain what happened. poll loading Should Joey Barton have been sent off? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:52:20.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
