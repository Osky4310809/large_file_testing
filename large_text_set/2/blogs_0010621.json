(Photo: Getty Images for NARAS) More Beyoncé stunned with her gorgeous glowing Grammy Awards look. She absolutely shined from head to toe as she performed and had our eyes glued to our television screens as she mesmerized with her goddess-like look and outstanding vocals. While she had her trusted makeup artist, Sir John — who has some of the best skills in the game — at her side, you wouldn’t believe that every ounce of makeup he used on her can be purchased for less than $20 right at your local drugstore. Beyoncé is one of the brand ambassadors for L’Oreal Paris, so we are not surprised that most of the products used were from the brand’s popular line of cosmetics. But we’re sure everyone can appreciate how affordable they are. For Beyoncé’s dazzling dewy bronzed glow, Sir John prepped Queen Bey’s skin before applying makeup with Hydra Genius Moisturizer . He followed by applying Infallible Pro-Glow Foundation and mixed in True Match Lumi Liquid Glow Illuminator in Golden . To further enhance her golden look, he also mixed in Infallible 24 HR Eye Shadow in Eternal Sunshine . To get her cheekbones chiseled to perfection, the darker and lighter shades of the Infallible Total Cover Concealing and Contour Kit were applied and anchored with shades from the Infallible Pro-Contour Palette . It was all blended beautifully together with the Infallible Blend Artist Concealer Blender and Contour Blender . For just the right balance, more of the True Match Lumi Liquid Glow Illuminator in Golden was applied to the high planes of her cheekbones. Then, Infallible 24 HR Eye Shadow in Eternal Sunshine was pressed on top of it to create a golden luminescence. Sir John mixed the Lumi Illuminator with body lotion and applied all over her body. The story behind her metallic eye look began with brown matte shades from the Colour Riche La Palette Nude . To sculpt it into a smokey eye, he applied the deeper brown shades in the crease of the eye and lighter nude shades on the lid. Also, he added in the Infallible Paints Eyeshadow in Nude Fishnet mid-eyelid. Everything was blended together to create a soft, smokey look with a “warm halo-like silhouette.” Infallible Matte-Matic Liner in Deep Brown was tightly lined near the lash line for ultimate intensity. To finally bring the look all together, Sir John painted Beyoncé’s lips with Dose of Colors Liquid Matte Lipstick in Cork and added Dose of Colors Liquid Matte Lipstick in Chocolate Wasted at just the corners of her pout for a more contoured, voluminous lip look. Beyoncé’s nails were also just as gold and gorgeous as the rest of her ensemble. Manicurist Lisa Logan used all OPI products to create the look. She began with one coat of Natural Nail Base Coat , then added two coats of Nail Lacquer in Glitzerland , and finished with one coat of Brilliant High-Shine Top Coat .
