The pop diva shared a somewhat cryptic tweet on Sunday, addressing \"false allegations looming in the press,\" and expressing her continuing support for Cannon. WATCH: Nick Cannon Dishes on Possible Mariah Carey Duet, Shares His Secret to Co-Parenting \"There's no validity to the false allegations looming in the press regarding our family,\" the text image reads. \"Nick is the father of my children, we will always stand up for each other, have each other's backs and we will always remain a strong family.\" â€” Mariah Carey (@MariahCarey) February 26, 2017 While it's not absolutely clear what stories the \"Butterfly\" singer is referring to, it is plausibly a response to a rumored N ational Enquirer article alleging that she is so concerned over Cannon's mental health that she is considering suing him for full custody of their children, 5-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan. Cannon lashed out at the Enquirer's allegations via Instagram last week. The image captured text outlining the allegations the Enquirer article is expected to make, including that he burned bridges with NBC executives over his America's Got Talent exit, a $1.7 million-dollar lawsuit over an app, and \"fits of rage,\" as well as the Carey custody allegations. \"MORE LIES!!! So the @enquirer wants to play around with my children,\" the 36-year-old wrote in response. \"Only Evil operates in this manner. What is the purpose? Except to exemplify pure immoral wickedness. If you report these lies expect a slander and defamation lawsuit. Look everyone, see how the media is trying to break a King? It's all good though, I'm a warrior! I was built for this! Me and my family, my mindset, and my spirit are all stronger than ever. I felt like releasing this so called \"journalist\" info to the public so you all can get at them, but instead I release nothing but positive energy into the Universe. No weapon formed against me shall prosper! I receive help through prayer and patience! #Blessed #Awakened.\" A post shared by LORD NCREDIBLE ALMIGHTY ðŸ•‰IkeTðŸ†™ (@nickcannon) on Feb 21, 2017 at 2:29pm PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:36:44.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
