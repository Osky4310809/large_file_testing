This houndstooth print one looks sharp paired with trousers and a turtleneck. Just make sure your dress shoes are in good shape, too—the details make a big impact here. The Sweater A post shared by Banana Republic Men's (@bananarepublicmens) on Jan 28, 2017 at 1:42pm PST \nA sport coat looks sharp because it's tailored and rounds an outfit out, but the right sweater can act the same way. Cardigans (especially shawl neck ones, like this) layer especially well over collared shirts. The Long-hem Piece A post shared by StyleSocietyGuy (@stylesocietyguy) on Sep 30, 2016 at 3:15pm PDT \nA long hem on a tailored jacket is an unexpected piece to add to a work wardrobe. The oversized fit works well over slim-fit pants; the contrasting fits complement each other. Swap out the tee for a dress shirt for an even more professional vibe. The Jacket A post shared by EJ Samson (@ejsamson) on Mar 7, 2016 at 6:15am PST \nA dress shirt, tie, and tough quilted jacket is a cool combination. The buttoned-up first layer is standard, but the black outerwear—with moto jacket detailing—adds personality. For an even more surprising look, ditch the details and just go right for the leather jacket .
