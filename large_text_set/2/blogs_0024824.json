David McNew/AFP/Getty Images \nNATIONAL HARBOR, Marylandâ€”Alt-right leader Richard Spencer was spotted at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of conservative movement activists and leaders, on Friday morning. Spencer, has made at least one other appearance at CPAC as reported in Slate by David Weigel in 2014. The latest visit comes just days after the rescinding of an invitation to Milo Yiannopoulos to deliver the conferenceâ€™s keynote address. \nSpencer makes a habit of attending political events to court controversy. He was in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention in 2016 and was booted out of a libertarian gathering on Saturday. Advertisement \nAt least one other leader of the alt-right has made a previous appearance at CPAC. In 2013, Matthew Heimbach of the white nationalist Traditionalist Youth Network came to CPAC with a companion who infamously suggested that slavery benefited slaves during a Q&A session at a panel on race. \nUpdate Feb. 23, 2017, at 9:24 a.m. : Spencer is tweeting from the crowd of the conference, where White House counselor Kellyanne Conway is currently being interviewed. Ronald Reagan is dead, and we killed him. #AltRight #CPAC2017 â€” Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 23, 2017 \nThis is a developing story. \nOsita Nwanevu is a Slate editorial assistant.
