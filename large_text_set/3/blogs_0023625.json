constitutional issues raised by the suit. The suit challenges the doctrine of “sovereign immunity” of Federal Republic of Nigeria, raises the question of is there no act requiring a citizen to exhaust “internal remedies” prior to commencing a suit against the Federal Government of Nigeria? The suit begs the question of what happened to the doctrine of “Public Forum” which Mallam Sanusi violated in a number of occasions prior to being placed on administrative leave? Mallam Sanusi criticized his employer, the Federal Government of Nigeria in violation of the open forum doctrine provisions which require that he resigns so that he can criticize the government as a private citizen. Also, is the court not aware that there is no central bank in the world that is autonomous? The autonomy of a central bank could be politically or economically defined. Political Autonomy of the Central Bank of Nigeria is a paradox because the president appoints the leadership of the bank. So where is the autonomy? While economic autonomy of the central bank is a reality to the extent the government allows the bank to manipulate open market operations. To this end, the central bank of Nigeria is not autonomous like every other central bank in the world in the true meaning of the term autonomy. Mallam Sanusi has broken all the laws in the book as Texans would surmise so how can justice be served. Justice will be served by having external auditing firm to conduct audit of the central bank for the last five years. The issue of Mallam Sanusi’s suspension has confirmed what the outside world has always feared that Nigeria has neither Attorney General nor Chief Justice. These government lawyers were supposed to educate the people about the facts and constitutional ramifications of the case. Rather, they allowed the president’s staff who are not lawyers to perform their duties. \nDr. Peter Ejirika,CPA \nUniversity of Mary Hardin Baylor \nTexas, Olusegun Adekoya \nA very insightful piece but mind you, most punch readers are anti GEJ which has clouded their ability to analyse issues critically the way you just did. So dont let it stop you from being analytical in future as they are surely going to attack you. Dr. Peter Ejirika,CPA Oga \nPeter, You are not a lawyer so please stop the mis-education. Most of what you write is gibberish. I tried to take you seriously, but you lost all credibility when you said your friend Dr. Nkechi Anaehi is a law professor at University of Chicago. I looked her up and there is no such person on the faculty. You have raised various legal doctrines that have no application to the instant case. You throw around legal terms to appear conversant with the law, but your misuse of the terms just betray your ignorance of the law. Sovereign immunity does not apply when the government as acted illegally. If the government has blanket immunity then its actions can never be challenged and we would not even need a constitution. We would in effect have a dictatorship. The president acted illegally and overstepped its bounds. I have already told you about administrative remedies and why they do not apply in this case. I challenge you to state what administrative remedies are available to Sanusi. Don’t give me any broad rule of law, please. I want you to state with specificity the administrative remedy that you maintain the Governor is bound to follow. Even if Sanusi has administrative remedies, he may be able to elect the judicial remedy, and it is up to the Federal Government to insist on the exhaustion of the administrative remedy otherwise the Federal Government may be deemed to have waived the administrative process. The problem with non lawyers when you try to debate the law is you know just enough to get yourself in trouble. You read some broad principles of law, but do not know how these principles work in real life, or apply to the pertinent facts. You state law but no authority to back your broad statements of the law. What is your legal authority for the doctrine of ‘public forum’. How did Sanusi violate this doctrine. Is there any law that requires that the GCBN keep secret information in his possession that funds were not paid to the government account.? Give me facts, law, authority, and analysis, if you want to argue like a lawyer. Dr. Peter Ejirika,CPA \nThis is the essence of this platform a market place of ideas. Sorry for the miscommunication Chicago law school not University of Chicago. Thanks Dr. Peter Ejirika,CPA \nAttorney Oga bear in mind the concepts of central banking, democracy and civil service are not indigenous to Africa and this forum is not appropriate for conducting legal analysis. So the Nigerian Administrative laws are facsimile of either the British or the American or a hybrid of both. Less I forget in the US one can go through law school and choose not to take the Bar Exams. In which case such individual could function as a personnel officer of a corporation or hearing officer of a state agency. Thanks. Dr. Peter Ejirika,CPA \nAttorney Oga: Alternatively, we can hold a non adversarial discussion on the legal issues I raised regarding Sanusi’s case and here is my email address: [email protected] . Thanks Dr. Peter Ejirika,CPA \nAttorney Oda: The substance of the argument of Attorney Ayo Olukotun reproduced below is parallel to mine: \nThe recent suspension of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Lamido Sanusi, has been trailed in the media by heated and unprecedented debate. \nLawyers lined up on both sides of the divide have paid microscopic attention to the provisions of the Central Bank of Nigeria Act of 2007 with a view to finding if there is any legal warrant or not for the President’s action. Similarly, the report of the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria which indicted Sanusi has been torn to shreds by some analysts who take the view that a whistle-blower is being hounded or by those who for other reasons have cause to plead his case. \nA respected Professor of Law and former university vice-chancellor posted on his blog a point by point rebuttal of the allegations contained in the FRCN Report. Sanusi himself could not have done a better job. On the side of Sanusi’s critics are well-known lawyers like Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN) who argue that his misdeeds are such that he ought to have been fired long ago. Obviously, only a court of competent jurisdiction can resolve the extensive legal tussle surrounding the President’s action. \nBut leaving aside the suspicious timing of the President’s axe coming close to Sanusi’s exposure of the running scams in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, it would appear to be stretching the meaning of autonomy if it is construed as a licence to operate above the law or if nobody in the system can call the CBN Governor to order. Indeed, much has been made of the independence of the Central Bank. These assertions, however, should be taken in the light of the fact that the credo is no longer as sacrosanct as it used to be in the aftermath of the global financial crises of 2007 to 2008 which saw the American Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank of Japan as well as the Bank of England surrendering some of their autonomy as fiscal and monetary policies converged in the bid to create soft landings for those economies. The autonomy model also did not quite apply to the developmental states of East Asia which practised a form of developmental central banking. This point and the issue of whether autonomy under Sanusi’s watch had been twisted to empire building do not strictly apply to the current legal controversy which pertains to the interpretation of the CBN Act. Nonetheless, they should be kept on the front burner as the nation seeks to learn the lessons of the Sanusi suspension saga. \nBut there are other issues involved, especially political ones. This writer invited a howl of protests from Sanusi’s sympathisers on the Freedom of Information Coalition listserv by suggesting that even though Sanusi had sensationally exposed the rot and corruption in the system, a desirable moral enterprise, no government in the world would tolerate its being indicted repeatedly by a high-ranking state official who has access to privileged information. Was I arguing that Sanusi should have kept quiet in the face of the monstrous drain pipe which the NNPC has become? The answer is no; but as Femi Falana (SAN) has recently admonished, and I believe from the point of view of decorum, Sanusi ought to have taken the option of resignation which was extended to him by the President rather than hanging on in the manner of a whistle-blower to rebuke the system from inside. \nLet us factor that although whistleblowing by disaffected insiders within a system and protection for whistle-blowers are becoming increasingly important in the global fight against corruption, the odds even in the advanced democracies are still immense. President Barack Obama of the United States has acquired a reputation for carrying out a crackdown on whistle-blowers by prosecuting them under espionage charges. Indeed, when Edward Snowden blew the lid on the massive surveillance policy of the National Security Agency last year, he famously told a reporter from The Guardian, UK, as he was escaping to exile, that he did not expect to see his homeland again. In short, for all the progress made towards the protection of whistle-blowers, it remains everywhere a high risk undertaking which in some tragic cases have resulted in the death of the whistle-blower. \nThat said, it should be remembered that not all whistle-blowers decide to go public. Recall for example, that it took 30 years before the world got to know that the “Deep Throat” that leaked information to two Washington Post reporters causing an uproar which resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in the 1970s was none other than W. Mark Felt who was billed to succeed J. Edgar Hoover as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation but was bypassed by Nixon in preference for a political ally. Even in our own political culture, whistle-blowers have flourished underground. In the course of my academic research about a decade and a half ago into the phenomenon of the guerrilla media, I was astonished to discover that several leaks were made to the personnel of the media by top level insiders within the Abacha administration but who, of course, for obvious reasons, had to remain anonymous. \nTo get back to Sanusi, he had a choice of being a less voluble reformer within the system or that of resigning to indict the administration using evidence that he had gathered during his tenure. In choosing to stay on to, as Tunde Fagbenle put it in the Sunday Punch (February 23, 2014) Sanusi had “continually poked his fingers into the eye of the government he belongs to and dug his finger into the President’s mouth daring him to bite him if he could”, Sanusi chose a course in Nigeria’s highly criminalised polity that was fraught with immense dangers. That scenario becomes even more vivid when taken in the context of Sanusi’s own lapses, not just those observed by the FRCN some of which are serious but those earlier revealed by such media as theSahara Reporters. \nAll of this however, is only one side of the story. The other, perhaps more important, aspect is that Nigerians and the entire world are watching what will become of the severe irregularities and apparent daylight swindles in the oil sector to the tune of $20bn revealed by Sanusi. It is a good thing that President Goodluck Jonathan promised in his media briefing on Monday that he would get to the bottom of the perennial short-changing of the nation by the conglomerate. But we can’t just leave it at that considering that several such promises in the past have gone unfulfilled. \nThe civil society should exert pressure on the Presidency to ensure that the rape of the nation by the NNPC which has gone on for long is brought to an end. Of course, it must do this in conjunction with the National Assembly which has the power of oversight on the Executive as well as with reformist insiders of a quiet bent within the administration. \nThe bottom line however should be that the nation should not return to the morass that the NNPC was and continues to be before Sanusi blew the whistle on it. \nI can provide you citations from Australia, France, Britain, Brazil and United Sates if this will help Nigeria to retract from this dangerous path. If you open the floodgate of citizens suing your government at will because of misinterpretation of the concept of central bank’s autonomy you will all live to regret it. Today Jonathan is the president, tomorrow who knows whom it will be? No further discussion of this issue. Thanks Oga \nvery informative and lucid recitation of historical facts very little on the law. I love the law and engage in academic discussions of the law when I am not holding brief for a client. The piece you just re-posted here is a nice blog about whistleblowing but it is short on the law. The very essence of whistleblower protection is that you can file a report or expose illegalities without risking your property or liberty. Whether a whistleblower chooses to resign or keep his job should be his choice because if he has to resign in order to blow the whistle then protection serves no purpose and you will have a chilling effect on whistleblowing. That is not a viable public policy goal. The examples giving by the lettered man are exercises in false equivalency Snowden had access to information by virtue of security clearance the information was classified and top secret. He copied the information and divulged some to the public. That is a crime. Sanusi was acting within his role as the Governor of the Central Bank and the curator of the nation’s fund by reporting to the government that a government corporation has not deposited funds belonging to the government. Why is the presidency even offended by this. The presidency should be interested in knowing when NNPC is pilfering national funds. Sanusi’s expose was not an indictment of the president, but information to the presidency and the legislature that we have a wayward corporation not depositing collected funds to the nation’s coffers. The other example giving by the writer about ‘deep throat’ and some whistle blowers in Abacha’s regime deciding to be anonymous has nothing to do with Sanusi’s decision to go public. It is an act of courage and frankly I see nothing but intrigue and doubt that can be garnered form anonymity in whistle blowing. Nevertheless the choice is that of the whistle blower, and clearly a whistle blower that decides to go public should be praised for courage and not attacked. The movement of countries to exact more control on their central banks has definitely not reached the USA, as suggested by the writer. Because even though there was a massive bailout of unprecedented proportions in the USA the fed under Bernake still exercised a great degree of independence and autonomy. The president wishes he could control the Fed but he just cannot. What does this have to do with the Governor calling out thieves anyway. I do not even see this rush to label the governor a whistle blower. He is not. He was simply doing his job. Whistle blower should be reserved to a lowly employee who sees infractions in higher places and files reports to the authorities or leaks these atrocities to the public. Sanusi was the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and in calling out the embezzlement at the NNPC was simply performing his duty. He was not blowing the whistle he was simply reporting missing funds. Now if Sanusi had gone further and traced the funds to Jonathan’s account and reported this, maybe that could be whistle blowing, but I am not even sold on that. Finally, the lettered man concludes that we should tread carefully before allowing the citizens to be able to sue their government willy-nilly. True, but remember the case of Paula Jones vs. William Jefferson Clinton? When considering sovereign immunity you must balance the need to protect government officials in their ministerial duties with the need of the citizens for redress and freedom from dictatorship. I remember the case of Fela Anikulap Kuti vs. FGN, Obasanjo, and others for the burning of his house. I was in the Lagos High Court as a spectator when Justice Dosunmu read his decision for the government on the grounds of sovereign immunity. Is that what you want? A country where the government can burn your house, throw a pioneering citizen like the late great Mrs. Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti from a second floor, and hide behind sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity simply does not extend to illegal acts, and definitely not to the pilfering of government funds. Before I became a lawyer I was an economist and I worked at the NNPC. The things I can tell you about my short stay at that place. Anyway, staying strictly with the law — I still believe GEJ overreached here. Most of the other things we are discussing are deflections and attempts to confuse the issues and cause mischief. If the GCBN violated his oath of office then institute the right process to remove him. We are trying to be a country of laws and not of men. No one said democracy is easy, it can be very inconvenient at times, that is what it takes to prevent authoritarianism. Remember Janet Reno who actually presided over the hounding of her boss Bill Clinton by the independent counsel Mr. Starr. Do you think Bill Clinton did not have the urge many times to fire Janet Reno? He didn’t, because he realized that the country, the constitution is bigger than even the president. Very difficult to control excesses of power. It is a cultural phenomenon that is learned over time. \nPerhaps some day Nigeria will get there if we stay with our democratic experiment. YemiO \nAnytime they address themselves as “Dr” on online forums, you can know that they are about to spew out rubbish. Our land, our laws our courts, stop comparing Nigeria to other countries. What does the CBN act say? What was Sanusi’s job description as handed out to him in the Act? Olusegun Adekoya \nHopefully Justice to go and cool down in kirikiri Dr. Peter Ejirika,CPA \nAttorney Oga bear in mind the concepts of central banking, democracy and civil service are not indigenous to Africa and this forum is not appropriate for conducting legal analysis. So the Nigerian Administrative laws are facsimile of either the British or the American or a hybrid of both. Less I forget in the US one can go through law school and choose not to take the Bar Exams. In which case such individual could function as a personnel officer of a corporation or hearing officer of a state agency. Thanks. Mazi JO \nHey, Dr. Pete! You said it all when you recommeded the hiring of a renowned independent accounting outfit to examine the Books of NNPC to establish the facts of the CBN Givernor’s allegations. This is imperative, for if that is not done, Sanusi will never get justice, conviction or acquital. We intend to ignore his inside position in these matters. These legal academic exercises we are having here will amount to nothing if simultaneous debates are not carried out along a well archestrated Audit of the whole Federal Government control and reporting systems. For the Government, I hope they are thinking along these lines for their next Administration or the eventual successors. Enough of these languishings in what is exquisitely clear. The people must be fed the facts. Period! Fanny \nThe answer to the question-headline is simply NO, he won’t get justice. Probably if Jonathan is kicked out next year, his case may be reviewed, and he might even be given the job back. Only time will tell. Omooba Adekunle Orafidiya \nSanusi will eventually get justice. Justice for Sanusi is a long prison term for spending money that was not appropriated by the National Assembly and sponsoring the Opposition. Abiodun Jejelola \nWhere do we proceed from here? How do we handle or tackle a case like this that has been taking to the court of law? What is justice and can someone get justice in this type of situation, where there are, all manner of allegations from both side- and yet no matter what these allegations are, there are truths that serves to be unravelled in them. I must say without mincing words that, both parties should find ways to resolve this, because, most of the things that we read from the pages of the media, are simply allegations- and hence must be proved. \nHonestly, we should not throw the present political dispensation into shambles! You see, if a person don’t know the cost and the price or the different values that many has given to get us this far, such a person is likely to take this on going political dispensation for granted or toil with it! That is probably some of the things that has been happening in some quarters. All of us are meant to work together and contribute whatever we can to the growth of the Nigerian economy and not to cause trouble for it. That is where our individual conscience comes into it. \nPlease, understand that, I’m not here to hold brief for Mallam Lamido Aminu Sanusi, but simply to say that whatever allegations that deserves investigation about the unaudited financial statements of the NNPC, and any other should be accurately investigated. In addition, it seems, as if there was a bit of haste or rush in his suspension- and perhaps that should be lifted as soon as possible, so that he can complete his tenure! \nI must say with all seriousness and also with all modesty that Governors of Central Banks, are not known to mess about or to behave carelessly or recklessly. It is such a very high position of responsibility that some for years, have aspired to get into, but somehow it has not happened for them. \nTherefore, there is the import of looking at these things very well and see how it can be resolved amicably. But that is not to suggest that, those allegations should be hid under the carpet if they are true, but because it is only few months that remain for the completion of his tenure, that he should be allowed to carry on with his work, but with conditions, and that is despite whatever investigations that has been put in place. \nThe truth of the matter is that, he should not be at logger heads with President Jonathan, as he got appointed to serve in such a very important position of authority. And that means, party politics should be set aside, even though he may have political inclination towards whatever party he desires. \nInterestingly, If we look at his tenure; because I remember that even in Dec 2006, the rate of the Naira, was fluctuating between 240 to 250’s- and there was no Boko Haram atrocities then-and up till December 2013, it continued with some measure of stability around 255 to 258 or so. That means for about 7 years the Nigerian currency did performed very well to an extent; but since 2014 it has gone to about 288. \nWe are not there yet, but there has been some measure of stability to date, apart from the recent news of suspension that may have, in one way or the other affected the Nigerian Financial market. It is not that simply, to dabble into things like this, but yet, on one can’t but comment as to cushion some of the detrimental effects of this saga! Therefore, with a suspension like this it can’t but somehow have some measure of detrimental effect on the economy- and usually, Governors of Central Bank don’t get treated like that except there has been gross and reckless behaviour that are contrary to the terms and condition of his employment.. And normally, suspension like this or termination of employment would pass through the Senate; but then that is matter of the Nigerian constitution. The fact is two wrongs don’t make a right. \nThere has been some weighty use of legal terms here and there and also the aspect of whether Mallam Sanusi would get justice! Well, justice is simply fairness. In other words, has been treated the way he should have been treated, knowing fully well that, things like this should go through the process of the Senate! Well, he has gone to court to challenge such a decision; and for that, it is only the Court that can handle and tackle that, and they know how to do justice to such a case. \nMy argument remain the same that, tacts should be used on both side- and thus the import of putting the interest of Nigeria far above personal interest. It is my prayer that may God, in His mercies and faithfulness see us through as an emerging economy that the committee of nations ahs been waiting for! May God continue to bless, prosper and fortify our great nation Nigeria!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:55:14.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
