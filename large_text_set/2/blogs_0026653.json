Grey’s Anatomy star Ellen Pompeo opens up about Meredith and Alex’s possible romance — calling it “weird.”\nAlthough we’re sure that a lot of people want Meredith to be happy with Alex , it might not be in the cards. In fact, the actress who has played Meredith for 13 seasons isn’t so keen on the idea.\n“Justin [Chambers] is one of my favorite people on the planet,” Pompeo told E! News on the Grey’s Anatomy set. “We’re really close, and it does feel weird.”\nOver the past two years, the idea of Pompeo and Justin Chambers’ characters becoming more than friends has definitely come up. Sure, they are adorable together, but maybe “just friends” is okay in this situation.\nABC “To potentially maybe have him as a love interest would be like kissing my brother,” the 47-year-old actress explained. “I used to say that about Patrick [Dempsey] all the time too just because we’d been together for so long.” What? Kissing McDreamy seemed odd once, too? Yeah, we can’t get behind this.\nClearly, the idea of Meredith and Alex together isn’t at the top of Pompeo’s mind, but it’s not personal. The Massachusetts native doesn’t really love her character’s romantic storylines.\n“The love interest part is not my favorite piece of this, I’ll be honest,” she said. “Kissing guys that aren’t your husband is, you know, a little weird. I guess it wouldn’t be if you didn’t like your husband, but I happen to be very, very fond of mine.”\nABC Chambers is also on team friendship when it comes to Alex and Meredith on the show.\n“I think anything is possible, but personally, I find it to be weird,” Chambers told E! News . “I think that they’re very much like siblings. They’ve been through so much together. Personally, I don’t see it. But, hey, this is Grey’s Anatomy . Anything is possible.” Anything is possible on this drama, and that’s why we love it!\nWhat do you think about a Meredith and Alex relationship? Would they be good together?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:26:06.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
