The system comes with 30 games pre-installed but determined hackers have managed to figure out a way to get more games onto the system. It appears that Nintendo knew that it would only be a matter of time before this happened, and hid a secret message for any would-be hackers inside of their diminutive console.\nThis message was left by a programmer who goes by the handle of “The Hanafuda Captain.” The Hanafuda name is an homage to the hanafuda cards that Nintendo used to sell before becoming a video game company.\nHere is what the message says:\n“This is the Hanafuda Captain speaking. Launching emulation in 3…2…1. Many efforts, tears and countless hours have been put into this jewel. So, please keep this place tidied up and don’t break everything! Cheers, the Hanafuda Captain.”\nThe code was posted on Twitter by user bakueikozo:\n大変！ファミコンミニの内蔵エミュレータの中身をのぞいていたらメッセージを発見したよ … ごめんキャプテン！！ズタボロに壊し始めちゃった #ニンテンドークラシックミニ #開発者からのメッセージ #削るとなぜか動かない系とはちょっと違う pic.twitter.com/C2dvIQlEuU\n— ひろみつ(85.1kg) (@bakueikozo) January 6, 2017\nGetting more games onto the NES Classic involves uploading one’s console memory to their PC, adding in extra ROM files, and then re-uploading them all to the NES Classic. To say that this is borderline illegal would be an understatement. It should be strongly stated that doing this can potentially brick one’s console if not done correctly. Considering how difficult it is to even find these mini NES consoles, putting one in danger like this may not be something you’d want to risk.\nYou can see how the hack works in the video below.\nOne thing that’s interesting about the hack is the discovery that the NES Classic’s operating system has a hard limit of 60 games — double what the console ships with. It’s unclear why Nintendo only loaded 30 games onto the NES Classic when it could have loaded 60. This is merely speculation on my part, but perhaps this means we’ll see an additional 30 games released for the system sometime in the future, once we can find the thing.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E5%89%8A%E3%82%8B%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AA%E3%81%9C%E3%81%8B%E5%8B%95%E3%81%8B%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E7%B3%BB%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AF%E3%81%A1%E3%82%87%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8%E9%81%95%E3%81%86?src=hash", "https://t.co/C2dvIQlEuU", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BA%E8%80%85%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E3%81%AE%E3%83%A1%E3%83%83%E3%82%BB%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8?src=hash", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2c5JLHl56g?feature=oembed?wmode=transparent", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%9F%E3%83%8B?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/bakueikozo/status/817293451813220352"], "published": "2017-01-11T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:21:46.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
