A post shared by Harry Gallagher (@night.scape) on Feb 20, 2017 at 4:08pm PST \nW hilst a spokesman for the Canary Wharf Group said that the latest incident was under police investigation, Gallagher had in fact left the country six days beforehand, boarding a flight to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday last week. \nIt is understood that he then scaled the Burj Kalifa on Tuesday, and was last night returning to the UK on a flight from Dubai International Airport. A post shared by Harry Gallagher (@night.scape) on Nov 26, 2016 at 5:19am PST \nW hilst the teenager’s feats have turned him into an internet sensation - he now has more than half a million followers and runs a start-up clothing brand - his mother, Amanda Gallagher, said her son’s activities were a “double-edge sword”. \n“Nobody wants their child risking life and limb. His brother was the freerunner in the family but he gave it up because he decided he didn’t want to kill himself,” she told The Times. \n“Harry never had that fear. He just has this passion for it. He is fearless. And as a parent, you can’t stop that journey. You can’t repress them. You have to find the strength and just roll with it.” \nMrs Gallagher, a freelance poker dealer from Barkingside, east London, added that she had been forced to accept the risks taken by her son. \n“I have to deal with statistics and odds every day. If it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen,” she said. “There are so many sports involving risk, whether it’s motorcycles or horseriding. You have to live in the moment, one day at a time. Every day is precious.” \nGallagher is a member of a new generation of young daredevils seeking fame on the internet, many of which record themselves performing similar stunts across the world before uploading them to Youtube and their social media pages. \nHowever, the new freerunning craze is considered extremely dangerous, with a number of internet stars dying in recent years attempting to capture ever riskier footage. \nCommenting on the case, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that no arrests had been made yet and investigations were ongoing.
