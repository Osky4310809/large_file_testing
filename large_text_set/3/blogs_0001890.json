When that was announced, Google said rollout would begin sometime this week. Well, today is the day! \nIn a video posted to YouTube, Google says the rollout of Assistant begins today, first going out to English users in the US, followed by English users in Australia. \nHere‚Äôs what Google previously sad about devices receiving Assistant. \nThe Google Assistant will begin rolling out this week to English users in the U.S., followed by English in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as German speakers in Germany. We‚Äôll continue to add more languages over the coming year. \nThe Google Assistant will automatically come to eligible Android phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. \nTo sum it up, be on the lookout for a Play Services update via Google Play on your device. That‚Äôs how Assistant will come. \nWhat‚Äôs the first thing you‚Äôll do with your Assistant? Post navigation \nIm gonna fondle my assistant. NWBuckeye \nSo, this update will come to my 2014 Moto X PE running Marshmallow, with Moto Assist, which Google clearly stole from Motorola when they pilfered the patents. And now I‚Äôll have two assistants for one phone. Moto Assist is still better. Especially when I can use a phrase like, ‚ÄúWoman, obey me!‚Äù, and it follows my commands. Brandon Sobotta \nAlready have it Chris Kupsco \nDid you have an actual play services update? I am on version10.2.98 and don‚Äôt have it yet. HTC 10 stock ROM Justin \nWhat version Google Play Services are you running? Chris Kupsco \nHas anyone gotten the update yet? Justin \nNothing here in my neck of the woods, Scottsdale AZ. kapilmachi \nAsk ‚Äúwhen will Google get messaging right?‚Äù Allen George \nCrush my enemies ‚Äì see them driven before me, and here the lamentations of the women. What else would I do first? Oh wait, I have a Pixel-XL kapilmachi \nI got in India. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d2e3153c1d6eacccbd65d922615ba3a5a0757514c0aac78cee03a3c7cfb2a21b.png Justin \nWhat version of Google play services are you running sir? kapilmachi \nI didn‚Äôt get any updates.. it‚Äôs server side toggle. Justin \nAh OK because I‚Äôm running the Google Play Services 10.5.37 Beta build and still don‚Äôt have assistant. I thought Google said it would come via a Google Play Services update. So server side could take weeks for it to arrive then, Google is slow with flipping the switch. Jerry Huster \nDoes this mean the Shield TV is getting it today too? Ben \n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the first thing you‚Äôll do with your Assistant?‚Äù \nSame thing my dad did with his: have an affair Jake L \nHave a pixel and still have not used the assistant more than a few times. It‚Äôs easier to type out a query then ask the phone verbally, it‚Äôs especially annoying when I have to repeat myself more than once. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nYup‚Ä¶Assistant 100% needs keyboard input Averix \nHow do you even know if you have the Assistant vs regular OK Google? Brian Walz \nI‚Äôm excited for the integration into Smartthings since I don‚Äôt have a Google Home device. xzero425x \nI really enjoy my Google now tap. Is that gone with assistant? It‚Äôs really handy or does the assistant do the same? JSo \nIt‚Äôs basically the same thing but acts a little differently. What do you use Now on Tap for? liquidamber5 \nI use it for quick access to Wikipedia, IMDB, etc., links for people and things. I find myself using it quite often, actually. JSo \nThat stuff is still there with Assistant. If it finds anything you can swipe up and get all the Now on Tap results. xzero425x \nHonestly I use it a bit for random translations, finding out people‚Äôs names in movies and other random stuff. I use it a lot more than I thought I would xD MichaelFranz \nI wonder if google is doing this because Bixby will launch with the S8 and probably (potentially) be just as good. No one really knows what Bixby would be capable of other then its another AI Assistant. Averix \nI wondered the same thing. If this is an opportunity to get people using Assistant so that they would rather have that than Bill Bixby. Tim Buchanan \nMaybe a dumb question, but will this just replace Google Now on my phone? How do I access Google Assistant? JSo \nSet it up with my HUE and WeMo stuff, probably. usrnamemike \nI wonder if this will change how it‚Äôs activated. On my S7 edge I have to be plugged in or screen on for Google to hear me. On my pixel it was all the time. trixnkix637 \nI know it‚Äôs a gimmick but i like the tell me a joke, poem, etc. features Assistant offers that OK Google didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a conversational software which Ok Google was not. Not sure how you can‚Äôt enjoy that. Aa DeL \nis it coming to india Gekko \ni wonder if i can set a microphone icon on my Nexus 6P home screen like i do now with Google Voice Search? i want to replace Google Voice Search with Google Assistant or maybe that will be automatic? does one replace the other with this update? i keep ‚ÄúOK Google‚Äù off ‚Äì i like to manually press the mic icon. DanWazz \nI‚Äôll probably set a reminder to actually use it. \nIn all seriousness, I curious too see if the AI is enough to get me to actually use it more often, rather than just typing it into the search bar. Howard Stern ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà \nI think its the best out. its creepy how fluid the back and forth convos can actually go. I mean, its not perfect. But its better than anything else out. tabguy2 \nHow do I tell if it is installed? Howard Stern ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà \nask ok google huskerhog \nTo quote the article above: ‚ÄúTo sum it up, be on the lookout for a Play Services update via Google Play on your device. That‚Äôs how Assistant will come.‚Äù Read the article. tabguy2 \nI read the article, Neither the article nor your response explain how I determine if I have it installed. If you know about Google Play Services then you know that it upgrades in the background so there‚Äôs no way to ‚Äúkeep an eye‚Äù on it to know when it updates. It may have already updated for all I know. I have no way of knowing. huskerhog \nOpen Google Now from My apps & games. (you can search for it to find it quicker) Click on the menu tab in the upper right. If Auto-update is checked, uncheck it. Now you‚Äôll see the update for Google Assistant when the update for Google Now comes through. NAM37 \nIs this going to collide with the Moto Voice on my MXPE? Francisco Pe√±a \nunless it gives me a blow job, not sure how excited I‚Äôll be. D in B \nwait‚Ä¶.so u want an artificial intelligent program to give you a blowie??? thats‚Ä¶.‚Äùshocking‚Äù üòâ Francisco Pe√±a \nno.. I said unless it gave me one.. which an AI can‚Äôt do, thus can‚Äôt get excited for it. Howard Stern ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà \nthink u missed his point haha santy83 \nSo this is basically Google Home on your phone? JSo \nI hope eventually I get the feature on my Nexus 5X where I can say ‚ÄúOk, Google. Play some music on my Nexus Player‚Äù and it will start playing music on my TV. The Pixels have this I believe. But running Assistant on my Nexus 5X as I have it right now, doesn‚Äôt do that. Steve \nWhat‚Äôs the first thing you‚Äôll do with your Assistant? \n‚Ä¶ \nFigure out what this does that ‚ÄúOK Google‚Äù doesn‚Äôt already do. Andy \nThat‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get. My wife pixel seems same as my Samsung S5. glimmerman76 \nIt really interesting when you use it in messenger it will give you suggestions based on the texts. Andy \nThought that was just Gboard doing that sinfoman \nIsn‚Äôt it Allo? Or is this functionality in Android Messages nee Google messenger on pixel/google devices? I have A messages on my Note 4 and it‚Äôs still ‚ÄúOK Google‚Äù Howard Stern ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà \nits better AI and you can have semi-conversations with it‚Ä¶.I like it better on my pixel than I do using ok google on my v20. but for the most part‚Ä¶.its the same. I guess at the end of the day, why would I want to have a conversation with my phone? Boomdizzle \nI agree. I feel like an idiot enough speaking into my watch to dictate a text much less asking questions out loud that I couldn‚Äôt just type. It is convenient for finding directions around town or finding a store near a specific location though while navigating, that‚Äôs about all I use it for. Howard Stern ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà \nditto. i use it quite a bit when i‚Äôm at home though. but only when my wife isnt home because she resorts to making fun of me. fd2blk78 \nHoward STERN!?! WHOA! Quint‚Äôs Sharking & Seashells \nYou didn‚Äôt know that HS is a big android phone user? He‚Äôs always on here commenting. Listen to his show and you‚Äôll hear him talking about it sometimes. Ryan \nThe girlfriend loves it, well our Google Home version of it. Putting things on the shopping list, turning lights on and off, playing music. \nbeing said, Im not sure what the experience will be when it comes to our Nexii. Last I heard they werent really the same version of the assistant and were missing so many things. dirtyjudo \nIt‚Äôs an issue for US with Accessibility problems. Snowbo13 \nI can use it to turn off my lights‚Ä¶ but that is why I added it to my nexus 6p when it came out. Now i have a 6p that all my devices think is a pixel. jwigley24 \nexactly. my nexus 6p is the same thing as a pixel just without the camera improvements. i have the launcher, the icons, the wallpaper, google assistant, etc. needa \nNo. It isn‚Äôt. Sorry. There are improvements to Android in the Pixel that a Nexus will never have. I only say this because what you said is a slap in the face to those on the Pixel team. Ryan \nAllo or assistant in phones? Because I have a smartthings controller that works fine with google home but the assistant in allo is completely useless. Daniel Russell \nThere are plenty of things that Assistant doesn‚Äôt do that normal search does. Such as: \n1. Determine what song is playing 2. Add things to different google keep lists. Assistant only adds to one ‚ÄòGoogle assistant shopping list‚Äô. 3. Open a podcast app. \nMaybe they‚Äôll fix some of this with the update, but it‚Äôs extraordinarily annoying as of now.
