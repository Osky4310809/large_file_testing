Despite Stunna still referring to Weezy as \"his son,\" the New Orleans rapper shared his true feelings with a crowd at Mass Appeal: Live At The BBQ , a SXSW concert held on March 16. \n\"There's too much good pussy and too many great muthafuckin' loyal fans to worry about bullshit ass Birdman,\" he said. He and his crew performed \"No Worries,\"right after addressing the crowd. He said shows like that made him stress less about \"bullshit people\" trying to steal his career. \nLast week, Lil Tunechi thanked Rick Ross for expressing support in his beef with Cash Money. Last Friday, Ricky Rozay released \"Idols Become Rivals,\" a Birdman diss track that exposed the label mogul's alleged tendency to cheat his artists and producers from receiving due payment.
