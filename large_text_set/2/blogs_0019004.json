Labour party MP Jo Cox was shot three times and stabbed at a library in the town of Birstall. The attack happened on the afternoon of June 16. Cox later died of her injuries. She was 41 years old. \nShortly afterwards, Tommy Mair, 52, was arrested by armed police. Cox’s Labour party colleague Maria Eagle tweeted that the attacker shouted “Britain First” before shooting. A possible reference to a far-right political party dedicated to getting the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union. \nCox was the member of parliament for Batley and Spen since 2015. She was also a campaigner Remain campaign in the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom surrounding membership of the European Union. \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. Neighbors Described Mair as ‘a Loner’ \nAnother man suffered minor injuries in the attack, reports the Guardian. Mair was arrested along Market Street in Birstall, according to West Yorkshire Police. The newspaper says that the other victim was a 77-year-old man. In a press conference announcing Cox’s death, a police spokesman refused to speculate on a motive. \nThe Press Association reports that neighbors have referred to Mair as a “loner.” Another neighbor, Kathleen Cooke, 62, told the Daily Telegraph: \nI am really shocked. He walked past my house this morning and said hello like he always does. He was wearing a grey T-shirt and his white baseball cap like he always does and he was carrying a small rucksack. He is just a quiet bloke who keeps himself to himself. \nHe is very helpful and he helps local people with their gardens. There is one neighbour who is a bit frail and he keeps her garden tidy. He has helped me cut my hedge a couple of times. \nHe has lived here for 40 years and has never been in any trouble and has never caused any trouble. He sometimes used to shout at the local kids if they played too near his house but that is fairly normal. \nI don’t think he belonged to any political party and I never heard him express any views about Europe or anything like that. To us, he was just Tommy, a local bloke we all knew. \nWhile another man who knows Mair, David Pickles, told the Telegraph, “I know he spent a lot of time in the library in town and liked to go on the computers there – I don’t know what he was looking up.” A friend of Mair’s mother, Mary, told the Guardian that Mair “practically lived in the library. He was obsessed with books. His house is full of them.” She added that the suspect last visited his mother the day before the shooting and that the attack was “totally out of character.” \nA man who said he’s known Mair for years, Nick Gannon, told the Guardian: \nIt’s shocking. He were a quiet guy, you would not think it of him. He would cut elderly people’s grass voluntarily. There were no reason to think he would be capable of something like this. \nHe was friendly. If you said hello to him, he would say hello back. He was not aggressive or anything. He wasn’t frightening. \nMair was a native of Kilmarnock in Scotland and never held full-time employment, reports the Daily Telegraph. His brother, Scott, told the newspaper, “I am struggling to believe what has happened. My brother is not violent and is not all that political. I don’t even know who he votes for. He has a history of mental illness, but he has had help.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:19:56.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
