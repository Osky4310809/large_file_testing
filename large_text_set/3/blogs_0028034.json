Delhi Police has filed an FIR against Gaikwad under sections 308 and 355 of IPC. It’s very important that the police probe be expeditious, rigorous and free from political interference. A clear message must go out that no politician can flout the country’s rules or demand special services at will, and with violence.\nAfter the incident, the unapologetic Sena MP from Osmanabad could be seen on TV boasting about how he hit the airline employee with his sandal 25 times. It seems he was angry because he had been made to fly in an all-economy flight from Pune to Delhi. Whatever the merits of his complaint, Gaikwad should know he has no right to assault anyone. Afterwards, IndiGo, Jet Airways, SpiceJet, GoAir, AirAsia and Vistara closed ranks with Air India to stop Gaikwad from flying on their aircraft. He was forced to travel back to Pune by train.\nGovernment must respect that the airline industry has the right to safeguard its passengers and crew. After all the Union civil aviation ministry is working on creating institutional mechanisms to check undesirable flight behaviour or unruly passengers. Current rules of India’s aviation regulator DGCA are unclear on the concept of a no-fly list, whereby passengers on such a list can be denied issuance of tickets. The provision that comes closest is section 3 of DGCA’s Civil Aviation Requirements, which was invoked by the airlines in the case of Gaikwad. Under this, passengers who are likely to be unruly can be off-loaded or refused embarkation if they pose a threat to the safety and security of the flight, fellow passengers or staff while on board aircraft.\nThe more it has been fed taxpayers’ money the more Air India has allowed elected representatives to treat it as their personal handmaiden. The more they throw their weight about, the more the remaining passengers shun Air India. It’s unusually bold of it to send a message that it will treat politicians the same as the people they represent. Government must recognise that only this kind of independent thinking can get the airline out of its dismal financial state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:03:30.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
