The visual language she uses in her work is ecstatic and crisp, and she holds her subjects dear, elevating them without being cloying. Portman reportedly gave birth to daughter Amalia just a few days after this was released, and so the narrative adds to the tenderness of the clip. At one point at around 2:20, you can actually see the baby kicking inside her belly, a wild thing to witness at any time, let alone in a music video depicting an Academy Award-winning actress. What an alien, bizarre thing! Anyway, this is probably as intimate as a fan is ever going to get to Portman, so revel in it if you like.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:14:29.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
