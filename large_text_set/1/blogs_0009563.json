To put it simply: The Game of Thrones actress looked stunning . While she may play nobility on the HBO hit, she is definitely giving us the vibes of another noblewoman . \nMaisie’s yellow gown and dark updo are very reminiscent of Belle from Beauty and the Beast . With this look, she may be giving Emma Watson a run for her money (or at least earn herself a role in the live-action movie Beauty and the Beast: An Enchanted Christmas ). \nCheck out the pic below: \nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images Seriously though, we’re loving this look. \nWilliams, known for her hilarious behind-the-scenes pics , shared an amazing snapshot of her rocking a full face mask. Her on-point caption read, “ what was ur process for getting ready today? sat in the bath for an hour looking like a right twat, wbu? #goldenglobes” \nwhat was ur process for getting ready today? sat in the bath for an hour looking like a right twat, wbu? #goldenglobes \nA photo posted by Maisie Williams (@maisie_williams) on Jan 8, 2017 at 10:54am PST \nHer hard work ~definitely~ paid off because she looks flawless . Now we can’t wait to see the adorbs photos she and bestie/co-star Sophie Turner post from inside the Beverly Hilton. \nWe feel like this is definitely Maisie’s way of telling us how excited she is for the live-action BATB film to come out in March! We feel you Maisie and can’t wait to see you kill it tonight! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T03:37:20.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
