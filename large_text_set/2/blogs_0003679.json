Credit Glogan When Marian Wright and Peter Edelman married in July 1968, their wedding was like an armistice. In April, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated; two months later, Senator Robert F. Kennedy was murdered — on June 6, Mrs. Edelman’s birthday. For years afterward, the couple would spend that day at Arlington Cemetery. The national tragedies were personal for the couple: Mrs. Edelman had worked for Dr. King, and Mr. Edelman had been an aide to the senator. The New York Times covered the wedding as a news story , sending Nan Robertson, then a reporter for the paper’s Washington bureau. The ceremony was held on the lawn at the home of their friend, Adam Walinsky, a speechwriter for Senator Kennedy, in McLean, Va. The choice to marry in Virginia was deliberate: A year earlier, the state’s law against interracial marriage had been struck down in a suit brought by Richard and Mildred Loving. The Edelmans were the third interracial couple to marry there after the Lovings prevailed. “I hate barriers,” Mrs. Edelman said. “And it was a time to bring down barriers.” Photo The Edelmans were the third interracial couple to marry in Virginia.

Mrs. Edelman would soon found the Children’s Defense Fund, now in its 43rd year. She would also hire a young Hillary Rodham, just out of law school. Now a professor at Georgetown University, Mr. Edelman would continue to work in law and policy. He was counsel to the Department of Health and Human Services during Bill Clinton’s first term as president. In 1996, the Edelman-Clinton friendship would publicly sour when President Clinton signed the welfare reform act of 1996; Mr. Edelman resigned in protest, and both he and Mrs. Edelman wrote articles denouncing the law. Yet in November it was at a Children’s Defense Fund dinner where Mrs. Clinton made her first public appearance after conceding the election , to thank her mentor for a lifetime of inspiration. “If there’s anyone who knows how to pick yourself up and get back on your feet and get back to work,” she said, “it is Marian.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:53:13.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
