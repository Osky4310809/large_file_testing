The attacker was driving an explosives-laden pickup truck and pretended to be recruiting day laborers, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said at a news conference. He waited for them to crowd around the vehicle and then set off the bomb.\nThe Islamic State asserted responsibility via the affiliated Amaq news agency.\n[Report: Islamic State has used chemical weapons 52 times in Iraq and Syria since 2014]\nIraqi forces are 2½ months into an offensive to oust the group from the northern city of Mosul , the largest population center that the group controls. They have slowly clawed back territory, but the militants have not ceded ground easily, inflicting heavy casualties.\nMonday’s multiple bombings appeared designed to shake confidence in the capital, and they followed a twin bombing in Baghdad on New Year’s Eve that killed 28 people.\nThe U.S. State Department condemned the attacks “in the strongest possible terms,” saying in a statement that “these vicious acts of mass murder are a sobering reminder of the need to continue coalition operations” against the Islamic State.\nA hospital in the Sadr City area also was struck Monday, killing 27. Another car bomb detonated near al-Kindi hospital in central Baghdad, killing one. Two other car bombs killed six people, the security official said.\nMeanwhile, Islamic State militants launched an attack on the main road from Baghdad to Mosul, a key military supply route. The road was reopened later in the day, officials said.\nAbadi had pledged to regain control of Mosul by the end of the year but now says it will take three more months to rid the country of Islamic State militants. Only about a quarter of the city is back under government control, and the presence of more than 1 million civilians is complicating the effort.\nGunmen also attacked a police station Monday in Samarra, north of Baghdad, where clashes continued late into the night and a curfew was imposed.\nRead more:\nIraq has never seen this kind of fighting in its battles with ISIS\nInside the economic war against the Islamic State\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostworld/", "https://twitter.com/@LovedayM"], "published": "2017-01-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T02:44:58.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
