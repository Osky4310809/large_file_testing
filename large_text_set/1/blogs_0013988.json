Included on Trump’s ‘me wall’ are photos of him with John F. Kennedy Jr. and Ronald Reagan, and a 1990 copy of Playboy Magazine with Trump on the cover. \nThe prayer and reflection came on a day when Trump hailed the ‘wonderful things’ that King stood for – following a nasty online spat with civil Lewis, who is skipping Trump’s inauguration after saying his election was ‘not legitimate’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:52:44.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
