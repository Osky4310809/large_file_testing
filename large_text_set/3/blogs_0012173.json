It is most important that workers are able to feed their families, pay rent and school fees, then other things can follow,” the President was quoted to have said. \nHe, however, thanked the governors for their display of “love and respect” for him. \nBuhari said he was overwhelmed by his recent experience in which states, irrespective of political differences, charged their citizens to pray in mosques and churches for his well-being. \nHe apologised to the governors for barring them from visiting him while he was in London. \n“I didn’t want government to move to London. I wanted it to remain here and I am glad it did,” he said. \nAfter narrating what he went through while on that vacation, Buhari noted the suggestion by the governors for him to take more rest, but insisted that he would remain relentless in the pursuit of the interest of the Nigerian people at all times. \nThis, according to him, was the only way to show his gratitude to the people who, he said, “had given so much to me. I was overwhelmed by the celebration of my return all across the country.” \nThe Chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum, Abdul-Aziz Yari of Zamfara State, assured the President, on behalf of his colleagues, that they would continue to support his policies and actions which they had adjudged as being in the nation’s best interest. \nThe governors of Imo, Akwa-Ibom, Osun and Abia states thanked the President for saving the day for the states through the first tranche of the London-Paris Club loan refunds. \nThey, however, called for the immediate release of the second one. \nThey also commended the trust the President reposed in Osinbajo, whom they said did not disappoint when he acted as President. \nBuhari had arrived the venue of the meeting chaired by Osinbajo at about 12.30pm while it was already underway. \nHe went round the hall to shake hands with the state governors and deputy governors standing in for their governors one after the other. \nThe governors also presented the President with a “get-well” card which they all signed. \nCopyright PUNCH.
