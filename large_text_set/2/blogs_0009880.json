The new desire to acquire IED precursor chemicals could suggest that Usman or other persons may have returned from Libya and have acquired IED-making skills intended to increase the activities of the group,’’ he said. \nAccording to the Minister, intelligence gathered also revealed that the group is making serious efforts to acquire sophisticated arms, including shoulder-fired rocket launchers.
