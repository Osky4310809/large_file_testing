(Photo by David Downs) In one of his last acts as president, Barack Obama has commuted the sentence of a Modesto man serving 20 years for simply operating a legal medical marijuana dispensary.\nThe White House announced Thursday that 37-year-old Ricardo Montes will be released from prison on May 19 after serving nearly half of a 20-year sentence for illegal marijuana distribution and conducting a continuing criminal enterprise, reports the Sacramento Bee . \nMontes and his high school friend Luke Scarmazzo were charged for crimes in 2008 related to the running of their medical marijuana dispensary, the California Healthcare Collective. Since then, over half of the U.S. has legalized marijuana use for either medical or recreational use, while a 2015 decision by U.S. lawmakers blocked both the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration from interfering with state-legal marijuana dispensaries. \n“I’m just ecstatic for him, so happy. He has three children waiting for him,” said Georgean Arsons, a New Jersey woman responsible for handling Montes’ and Scarmazzo’s clemency appeals. “I believe he is completely deserving. With all of the changes to marijuana charging practices, he would not be charged today if he was doing the same thing.” \nA White House statement says that many of Obama’s 1,715 total commutations were made due to rectify “unduly long sentences for drug crimes.” \n“With today’s action, the President has granted more commutations than any president in this nation’s history and has surpassed the number of commutations granted by the past 13 presidents combined,” the statement said. “The President set out to reinvigorate clemency, and he has done just that.” Oscar Pascual", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:08:00.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
