Superior Court, alleges today’s veterans are being discriminated against as the previous pension system provided more financial support over a lifetime.\n“This doesn’t make the lawsuit go away, this budget,” Sorochan said. “Why was something good enough for Korean War veterans not good enough for these guys?”\nMeanwhile, the budget offered little in the way of good news for the military, as the government revealed plans to spend about $933 million less than anticipated on new military equipment over the next six years.\nFinance officials blamed delays in several procurement projects but insisted the money, which is on top of $3.7 billion deferred last year, would be available when it’s needed in future years.\nAny delay is nonetheless bad news given the large numbers of old military equipment in need of replacement, while experts have worried such deferred funding could get axed in future deficit-cutting.\nRelated Liberals hope to get Canada ready for the future with budget for 'everyday folks' — and $28.6B deficit National Post View: Liberals should put military’s need ahead of short-term political … oh, who are we kidding Federal budget to offer disabled veterans a lifetime pension by end of year NDP Leader Tom Mulcair accused the Liberals of deferring the funding to massage the budget’s overall numbers, reducing the deficit at the military’s expense.\n“Canadians have every right to be concerned about that,” he said, “because we are in desperate need of new ships for our Navy, we’re in desperate need of new fighter aircraft for our Air Force, and there’s no way that with the type of budget we’ve seen here that they’re going to be getting them.”\nThe measure was particularly surprising given the pressure the U.S. and NATO are putting on allies to increase the amount they spend on their militaries, which currently equals about one per cent of GDP for Canada.\nThat is half of NATO’s two per cent target and puts Canada among the bottom half of allies.\nThe Liberal government did leave open the possibility of adding more money to the defence budget later this year, after it releases its much-anticipated defence policy.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:17:34.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
