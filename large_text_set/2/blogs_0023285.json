Yeah, there we should stand up. Come on. There we should stand up. OK. And by the way, we love our flag,” Trump said.

So we’re all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before. There’s never been anything like this. There’s been some movements, but there’s never been anything like this,” Trump added. \nAfter the speech, Trump’s comments were taken as a literal crowd estimate. \nThe Hill devoted a story to saying Trump “falsely claimed … that lines to get in stretched back ‘six blocks.'” The story reported the general sense of calm outside the hall where Trump spoke. \nJezebel’s The Slot chimed in, saying, “For what it’s worth, National Harbor isn’t six blocks wide or long.” Advertisement - story continues below \nCNBC also joined in the fact checking. Trump says lines \"go back 6 blocks\" for his speech &\"you won't read about that\" \nPress pool says the line appeared to be less than 1 block pic.twitter.com/t5XzQLCRyT \n— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 24, 2017 \nSome on Twitter featured images from the venue where CPAC was held showing there were no lines outside as if there was a need to take Trump’s figurative statement and disprove it. These are the entrances to the hotel where Trump just claimed people were lined up six blocks waiting to get in #CPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/zoYUAXS4sy \n— Gabrielle Bluestone (@g_bluestone) February 24, 2017 \nTrump’s style of being figurative over being literal was shown in the speech, which often used the media as a foil, during one riff on how they would report Trump’s reception at CPAC. \n“You know the dishonest media, they’ll say, ‘He didn’t get a standing ovation.’ You know why? No — you know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat. So they will say, ‘He never got a standing ovation,’ right? They are the worst,” Trump said. \n“So — sit down,” Trump then commanded, to a wave of laughter. “‘Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.’ They leave out the part, ‘They never sat down.’ They leave that out.” What do you think?
