Unfortunately, although (since it’s had an impact on too many people) I know that I should give the Letter more attention than I have, I just haven’t been able, thus far, to muster much enthusiasm for doing so. I found reading it excruciating and exasperating, rather like the infamous Chinese water torture. \n\nHere though, Tarik LaCour, a very bright fellow, commences another response:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:16:29.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
