A post shared by Celina Locks (@celinalocks) on May 1, 2015 at 7:13am PDT \n“I met Ronaldo and he came to my concert and invited us to his house which has a club in it,” Ipswich Town fan Ed Sheeran revealed to The Sun on his friendship with the ex-Barcelona and Real Madrid striker. \n“We went there and he showed me my dance routine from the Thinking Out Loud video. \n“He had learned it with his girlfriend, which was amazing.” \nSheerhan, who appears set to head back to the top of the charts with his album Divide this week, is planning to meet up with Ronaldo and his other half Celina Locks again after a performance in May. \nHe added: “I get to see him again, that’s exciting. I really like him. \n“He was so cool. I got a shirt signed from him and it says, ‘To Ed, you f***. Ronaldo’.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T14:20:39.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
