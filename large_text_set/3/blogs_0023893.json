The first came in 2010, and both have come against Moeller. \nYoung, a Butler commit, was fouled driving into the lane by Moeller's Caleb Canter with 3.6 seconds remaining. He only had five points, but grabbed 10 rebounds for Massillon Jackson (28-2). \nLogan Hill had 12 points to lead the Polar Bears, and Jaret Pallotta had 11 points and seven rebounds. \nThe Crusaders (28-1) entered the game as the last remaining unbeaten in the state of Ohio and tried to be the first Division I team to go undefeated since Zanesville in 1995. \nMoeller's Miles McBride had a game-high 15 points and grabbed nine rebounds. Keegan McDowell added 14 points and eight rebounds. \nBoth teams shot 13-for-37 from the floor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T08:32:09.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
