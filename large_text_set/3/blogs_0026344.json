Saying it is important, but it will lose meaning if there aren’t actions to back it up. You can’t just tell her how you feel. You have to show it. Again and again. You have to show it.\nIf you really love her, be someone who is true to their word. When you tell her how you feel, don’t just say what you think she wants to hear. Don’t just say what you think will get you points. Be honest. Be real. Be authentic. If you really love her, you owe her that.\nIf you really love her, fight through the storms together. Don’t expect her to paddle you safely to shore, or that you should decide on the best emergency strategy alone. Lean on each other and come up with solutions. Compromise and work. If you really love her, you have to work side by side.\nIf you really love her, don’t assume what she needs. Ask. \nIf you really love her, don’t go silent when she asks you what’s wrong. You have to talk about the stuff that isn’t fun to talk about. If you really love her, you have to dive into uncomfortable moments together. You can’t brush things aside or pretend they don’t exist. Open up to her. Let her in. \nIf you really love her, commit to the relationship. Don’t be wishy-washy. Don’t give her enormous amounts of affection one day and pull back the next. If you really love her, you have to love her consistently. Even when it’s scary.\nIf you really love her, be there when she’s messy and upset and not the best version of herself. She’s an imperfect human being and loving her means not taking off when things get sticky. It means showing up. It means staying. \nIf you really love her, show her. And never stop showing her. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:03:45.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
