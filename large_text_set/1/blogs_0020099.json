From Reich’s early ambitions as a jazz drummer to Glass’ radio repairman-turned-record collector father to Adams' parents’ big band performances in Lake Winnipesaukee, The Sounds That Changed America , explores the story behind the composers who created a sound that changed America. \nReich at 70, photo by Jeffrey Herman \nIn addition to concerts of the composers’ symphonies, talks about the innovation of their work, and screenings of films which utilized their compositions, The Barbican has also created a masterful online exhibition and tribute to the composers. The website is tastefully designed and minimalist in its aesthetic. It offers an unparalleled unification of the simultaneous development of all three composers, from childhood to the highest heights of their careers. It combines full-length documentaries, archival photographs, and samples of compositions to contextualize the histories of Reich, Glass, and Adams. \nJohn Adams, photo by Deborah O’Grady \nBeyond the rich histories, the website identifies the similarities between the composers in order to formulate an argument for their uniquely American sound and their lasting influence. Narrative touches on Reich recall his works, Tehillim (1982) and The Cave (1993), citing both as Reich’s attempt to identify his own religious and spiritual underpinnings. \nPhilip Glass, photo by Steve Pyke \nFor Glass, it is a focus on the American psyche. A quote by Susan McClary describes the opening of his Glassworks (1982) by stating, “before us glimmers once again the romantic soul, decked out with all its requisite emotional trappings—alienation, memories of lost arcadia, and longing for utopia.” \nPhilip Glass at 75, Koyaanisqatsi, Barbican Hall © Mark Allan \nBut Adams' version of America may be the most apt. It alludes to his style as bearing “high octane journeys in fast cars and their subsequent valorisation and glamorization in road movies. But there is also a very different America of the moment, one paralysed by fear and self-doubt.” To fully experience this, listen to his composition, “Shaker Loops: 3. Loops and Verses” and wait for the climax from 5:00 on. \nThe Sounds That Changed America offers a new perspective on minimalist music in America, one that unites the sounds of its greats through investigation into their histories, influences, and reflections. \nPhilip Glass at 75, Koyaanisqatsi, Barbican Hall © Mark Allan \nSteve Reich Musicians, Music for 18 Musicians-Tokyo, courtesy The Barbican \nYou can find more information on upcoming events in the series at the Barbican website. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:25:51.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
