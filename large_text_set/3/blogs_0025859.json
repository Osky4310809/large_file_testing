Parth Samthaan accused of molesting a model, FIR filed against the actor The case has been filed by Model Sushmita Chakravarty today in Bangur Nagar Mumbai By Shweta Mahesh | Published: March 25, 2017 9:28 pm Mohit Raina, Gautam Gulati, Gautam Rode - Television's hottest actors - view pics! \nFrom Kapil Sharma-Sunil Grover ‘s ugly spat to Shilpa Shinde’s sexual-molestation case , television actors are in the news for all the wrong reasons. And the latest one to enter the brigade is Parth Samthaan . An FIR has been filed against the Kaisi Ye Yaariyaan fame for Molestation (354-A) in Bangur Nagar Mumbai. The case has been filed by Model Sushmita Chakravarty today. Parth returned to Mumbai two days back. The police have yet not arrested him but have called him to the police station for interrogation. Controversy over his personal life seems to always surrounded the actor and this is the latest one. \nParth is not new to controversy and is always involved in some controversy or the other. After Vikas Gupta this is the latest one. Though Parth remained unavailable to comment, sources close to him say that he is unaware of the same and says that it seems like a trap to tarnish his image. Sources say that the fingers are being pointed at Vikas Gupta, who was embroiled in a ugly public controversy with Parth. Rumoured to be lovers once upon a time Parth and Vikas are on loggerheads over accusations and legal notices. \nIt all started when Parth suddenly rose to fame with his youth show Kaisi Ye Yaariyaan. He played the suave and dashing Manik Malhotra whom the girls swooned over. With Kaisi Ye Yaariyaan he became an overnight sensation but along with success came his share of arrogance. Parth was seen in the second season of the show too. But it seems things went wrong between him and his show producer Vikas Gupta. \nIn 2013, Parth accused Vikas of molestation after which Vikas shared with the media that he and Vikas were in a homosexual relationship. Things turned ugly for Parth when popular TV producer Ekta Kapoor also confirmed that Vikas and Parth were in relationship. According to a report in DNA, Ekta revealed that Parth and Vikas were actually in a relationship and the former is lying. Ekta was quoted saying in the report that she has seen many videos of Parth, where he is seen declaring his love for Vikas. She also stated that within 20 days of accusing Vikas of touching him inappropriately on December 7, 2013, Parth was with Vikas, holidaying in Bangkok. Ekta is aware of this because even she was in Bangkok at the same time to celebrate New Year. \nParth also accused Vikas of non payment of dues for his Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya. Majority of TV stars supported Vikas and very few actors came in out in Parth’s support .Though later Parth apologized but things soured between him and Vikas. \nParth is known for his arrogance on his sets and his co stars like Niti Taylor never shared friendly vibes with him. \nThings settled down a bit as Parth got busy with his Bollywood debut Googly ho Gayi with actress Poonam Kaur, Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahab. Parth hails from Mumbai and started off as a model. His first show on TV was Best Friends Forever on channel . He has done episodic shows like Savdhaan India Webbeb etc. But later he shot to fame with Kaisi Ye Yaariyaan in both seasons. After the show wrapped up Parth got busy with his film. He has also sung for the film, we hear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T19:32:07.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
