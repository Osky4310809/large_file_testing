I’m not going into it.” \nHis suppression of free speech and human rights: “I’m not discussing about all that.” \nAnd on MH17, she at least conceded it might not have been a good move: “If he was involved in that, I’m not in support of that.” \nHowever, the most serious challenge the One Nation leader faces today is over her suggestion vaccinations should not be compulsory and that they might not protect children. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the Australian Medical Association have condemned her comments made on national television on Sunday. \n“The health of our children, the health of the nation, depends on vaccination and that has to be as close to 100 per cent as possible,” Mr Turnbull said. \n“It is a vital health objective to ensure that everybody is vaccinated.” \nSenator Hanson today claimed it was a fake controversy, tweeting: “The media’s obsession with manufactured controversies is why they’re failing. Aussies want media to talk about things that matter!” The media's obsession with manufactured controversies is why they're failing. Aussies want media to talk about things that matter! #auspol — Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) March 6, 2017 \nHowever, AMA president Dr Michael Gannon, who is based in Perth, had a counter-tweet saying Senator Hanson had not based her remarks on science. 🇦🇺 @PaulineHansonOz is a serious player in #auspol .
