While this increased competition amongst manufacturers has helped bring down the cost of smartphones and spoilt the consumers for choice, it has become tough for the companies to deliver products which offer something unique. At its MWC booth in Barcelona, Alcatel, a smartphone brand which mostly thrives in the budget segment, managed to attract a lot of attention owing to its A5 LED smartphone. \nThe Alcatel A5 LED employs the concept of semi-modularity in a similar fashion as we saw on the Moto Z family. The LED back panel demoed at MWC features an array of multicolour LEDs which are fully customisable via a dedicated app and can be used to assign certain colours or patterns to various contacts or notifications. These LEDs can also sync up to the music which you’re playing on your phone, thereby making vibrant patterns and animations. The other options for snap-on rear covers include a battery pack and a speaker with a kickstand, again similar to the Moto Mods. The rest of the specs of the Alcatel A5 LED include a 5.2-inch HD IPS display, an octa-core MediaTek MT6753 processor mated to 3GB of RAM along with a 2,800mAh battery. The device gets an 8MP rear snapper, a 5MP front shooter and runs Android Marshmallow. To get a closer look at the smartphone, make sure to browse through the gallery below. 1 of 11 \nRetailing for €200 (~Rs 14,000), the Alcatel A5 LED could be a game changer considering it is the first to bring the concept of modularity to budget smartphones. We sure hope the phone makes its way to India… Facebook Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T09:46:08.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
