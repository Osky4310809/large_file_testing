Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing hadn't even begun before it was disrupted by protestors. Two men, clad in KKK uniforms and wearing foam \"#1\" fingers, got up and started shouting as Sessions entered the room. The two shouted a variety of things, including Sessions' full legal name, until they were removed by security and arrested. They were associated with the protest group Code Pink. \nWatch a video of the incident here: As Sessions walked in... pic.twitter.com/4cmgzRL2q2 â€” Lisa Desjardins (@LisaDNews) January 10, 2017 \nAlthough the two were lacking the signature hot pink outfits associated with Code Pink, the group took credit for the stunt on Twitter.
