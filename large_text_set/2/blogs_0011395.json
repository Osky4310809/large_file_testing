Wi-Fi users got speeds more than 80 percent slower than what they had paid for, according to the complaint. \nInvestigators found the company had been misleading customers after speed-testing hundreds of thousands of accounts during a 16-month investigation, according to the attorney general's office. \nThe company also used subpar modems and routers, rigged test results to mask its slower speeds, and failed to make capital investments necessary to improve its network, according to the complaint. \n“Millions of New York families and businesses depend on reliable internet for everything from running a business to communicating with family and friends,” the attorney general said in a statement. “No one should be paying a premium for speeds and services they aren’t receiving.\" \nInternet users can use the following tools to check their internet speeds:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T19:19:06.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
