Behind the nicknames of notorious Mexican drug cartel figures \nIn Texas, the many offices appear to have their time spent dealing with cases involving the Sinaloa, Gulf, Juarez, the Knights Templar, Beltran-Levya, Jalisco and the Zetas. \nLooking at the areas of influence, the state is split into three portions: the south and southeast belong to the Gulf Cartel, the north and northeast belong to the Sinaloa, and a small slice of west Texas is in Juarez hands. \nLOOKING AHEAD: What is Donald Trump going to do about the drug war? \nSince July 2015, the Mexican Drug War wages on with new atrocities being reported almost every month, including the discovery of hidden graves, mutilated and dismembered bodies and attacks on law enforcement officers. \nThe most notable incident happened on July 12 when Joaquín Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, escaped a maximum security prison via a secret tunnel in his cell. He was recaptured a year later following a joint U.S.-Mexico operation. Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.
