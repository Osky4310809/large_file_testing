Night Tube workers to go on strike Jailing the dad, Judge Jonathan Bennett paid tribute to the family’s neighbour who called police.\nHe said: ‘It alarmed him that the children never went out and were constantly crying at night.\n‘And, when he went out one day, he heard a child crying behind the door and when he came back an hour later, the child was still crying.’\nThe judge added that while the bedroom had been unclean and dangerous, the fridge had been full, there were new toys and clothes in their wrappers and the kitchen and living room had been tidy.\nHe said: ‘It does not have the hallmarks you see in so many of these tragic cases, where parents are completely unable to cope.\n‘Furthermore you were obsessed by the bad behaviour of your older child. You said to the police officer you felt sorry for whoever was going to look after him.’\nSchool sends 38 pupils home for protesting toilet ban Judge Bennett said the dad had demonstrated a ‘callous attitude’ to his children, by the conditions they had both had to live in and by starving them of affection and love.\nHe said: ‘It was, in my view, sadistic. This was, in my view, serious-ill treatment.\n‘It was for a two-month period but, in my view, two months for those two children in those conditions is protracted. We’ll never know the harm that has been caused to them.’\nThe court heard an ‘experienced’ social worker was immediately hit by a ‘strong smell of faeces’ when she opened the child’s room.\nInside was a single toddler’s bed with a ‘disgustingly dirty mattress’; the curtains were ripped and covered in faeces; there were handprints in faeces over the walls; and faeces on the ceiling.\nMother and newborn baby found dead at house after concern for their welfare The social worker, who has not been named, said to use the words ‘disgusting and vile’ was to do those words a disservice.\nThere were also tiles on the floor that had been pulled up, exposing sharp edges, and some dirty cars but no other toys and two dirty baby bottles.\nShe said: ‘I remember being horrified and shocked. I couldn’t understand how a room could be like this, how we didn’t know of this family.’\nShe had called the police and said that at no point did the dad show any shame or remorse for the state of the children or the bedroom.\nThe court heard that he had put most of the blame on his wife and the eldest son.\nA doctor who examined the children, once they had been rescued, said they showed signs of ‘significant neglect’ and that they had been in a cold environment from some time. They also displayed ‘developmental delay’.\nThe children are now in foster care.\nSonal Ahya, defending father, said: ‘His wife was effectively bedbound and didn’t leave the room and he was caring for her and the children – he failed miserably.\n‘It was a two-month period and it’s on a basis he was struggling to cope because of the family dynamic over that time.’\nFollowing the case, an NSPCC spokesman said: ‘No child should have to suffer sickening neglect like this, and it is absolutely vital that we are all alert to the signs that a child needs help.\n‘This truly shocking case was brought to light when a neighbour reported their concerns.\n‘We would urge anyone in this situation to speak out without hesitation, as it could save a child from serious harm.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T14:22:32.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
