That is why we are out, we played for 45 minutes, but you have to play for more than that. The Spaniard said his side only turned up for 45 minutes of the second leg (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n\"But it is not about the defence and the goalkeeper. \n\"Obviously, you cannot spend 90 minutes like we were in the second half, but the gap between the first and the second was too big.\" \n\"But we will learn, the situation will help us in the future.\" poll loading Will Manchester City win the Champions League while Pep Guardiola is in charge? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:38:05.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
