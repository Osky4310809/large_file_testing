It’s a long story. Fuck people that don’t appreciate you. I made my first million when I was 17 and took care of my whole family since then.” A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Mar 13, 2017 at 10:14am PDT \nHe also promised an impending interview to clear up “all these fake ass stories.” New interview coming soon clearing all these fake ass stories up. Love y'all \n— Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) March 13, 2017 \nThe outburst follows the emergence of a video by Soulja Boy’s brother John Way, claiming that Soulja Boy left him and their mother behind in the hood after he blew up. John Way also dropped a diss track called “Overdue” where he claims that Soulja Boy lies about sleeping with Rihanna, and brags about shooting someone even though it was in self defense. \nWe somehow don’t see Floyd Mayweather and 50 Cent getting involved in this one.
