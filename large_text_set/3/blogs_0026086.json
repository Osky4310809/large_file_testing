First, you need to know Justin Bieber is Canadian. REX/Shutterstock \nIt’s true. He was born and raised in Ontario, Canada. Perhaps you already knew this. But did you know The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, is ALSO Canadian? REX/Shutterstock \nHe was also born in raised in Ontario, in a district that is now a part of Toronto. \nYou should probably also know Gomez has dated both of these men (and is, in fact, currently dating The Weeknd ). \nOK, great! Now that you know these things, we can finally get to the joke I was telling you about. \nBasically, Gomez was doing an Instagram livestream with her makeup artist, Hung Vanngo, while she was on set for her Pantene shoot on Tuesday, March 21. \nFirst, Vanngo had Gomez give a shoutout to his home country, Vietnam. Then he added Canada to mix… and I think you know why. \n“And Canada,” he said, to which she replied enthusiastically, “And Canada!” \nBut then Vanngo added, knowingly, \nYou know Selena love Canadians. \nThen he started giggling maniacally while Selena immediately moved the camera away from him, saying “Alright, alright” in her “I’m so done voice,” and actually turned off the Instagram stream. \n— Selena Gomez News (@LifeWithSelG) March 21, 2017 \n(But she did come back on later, perhaps after giving Vanngo a talking to about boundaries.) \nWhile she didn’t seem too upset at her makeup artist, she clearly wasn’t going to let him say anything else too incriminating to her many, many Instagram followers. \nBut look, Vanngo is right — Selena really does love Canadians. The facts are right there. Date night!

Girl’s got a lot of other more important stuff going on her life, after all. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
