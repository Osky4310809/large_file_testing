The two sides would trade plenty more goals, with Man City eventually winning 5-3 in the first leg of the round-of-16 encounter. Textbook diving header from Falcao, his 14th goal in 15 games (all comps). #UCL #MCIASM https://t.co/8TMQeD84KD — FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 21, 2017 \nAfter Kylian Mbappe helped Monaco regain the lead in the 40th minute, Sergio Aguero countered with a goal of his own in the 58th to tie the game for City. It was the first of two goals for Aguero on the memorable Champions League night. — FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 21, 2017 \nFalcao managed to make up for an embarrassing missed spot kick to give his side a one-goal edge with a beautiful chip shot over goalkeeper Willy Caballero, and for a moment it appeared the former Manchester United flop would be the hero for the Ligue 1 side. Remember when Falcao was really, really good? Yeah, that Falcao is back. What. A. Goal. #UCL #MCIASM https://t.co/kBe23GeVnk — FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 21, 2017 \nBut Man City went on to once again even the game thanks again to Aguero, and then John Stones gave City a 4-3 lead in the 77th minute. If you like defense, you've watched the wrong game. Even the defenders are scoring. Stones' first #UCL goal! #MCIASM https://t.co/qPZMFfLGE2 — FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 21, 2017 \nLeroy Sane put the icing on the cake in the 82nd minute to give his team a 5-3 victory in the thriller.
