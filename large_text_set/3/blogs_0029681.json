The protections were planned to be enacted by the end of 2017 and would have forced ISPs to get permission from their customers before selling their internet browsing and app habits to advertisers. \nThe vote was largely bipartisan, with those in favor being exclusively Republican. However, several Republican lawmakers crossed over to vote against eliminating the privacy measures. Last Thursday, a Senate vote set the stage for the   to send the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk after they voted exclusively on party lines against the measures. Senate votes to overturn #FCC regulations on internet privacy https://t.co/iNNlnR3RMW pic.twitter.com/pUpyTjg4Bz   24, 2017 \nThe planned protections were proposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and would have prevented ISPs and broadband providers from selling information, including where customers bank, shop, browse, their political views and even sexual orientation. \nThose in favor of eliminating the protection measures have claimed that preventing ISPs from requiring consumer consent for customer information will eliminate competition among providers. \nIn a press release , Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) defended rolling back the protections, saying the FCC's privacy policy \" has the potential to limit consumer choice, stifle innovation, and jeopardize data security by destabilizing the internet ecosystem. \" —   \nSupporters of the FCC regulations believe the repeal will only benefit broadband providers. \n“ Instead of making the industry more competitive, what this bill wants to do is give these four or five ISPs even more power, ” Representative Ro Khanna (D-California) told The Guardian. \nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting privacy on the internet, released a statement saying “ should President Donald Trump sign S.J. Res. 34 into law, big Internet providers will be given new powers to harvest your personal information in extraordinarily creepy ways. ” \nFor internet users who want to protect their privacy from ISPs, the options are slim going forward. Some may choose to utilize a virtual private network (VPN), a frequently paid service that routes all internet traffic through one server not directly connected to the user. However, many sites like Netflix try to ban VPN users from utilizing their services. \nOthers may move over to using Tor, a more complex server that could leave users open to malicious servers. \nRepealing the FCC’s regulations is not a done deal, yet. President Trump has yet to sign off on SJ Res 34, leaving opponents room for a Hail Mary. The EFF’s Jeremy Gillula told the Guardian, “ I think we’d try to convince President Trump that signing a bill that helps big corporate interests by eliminating Americans’ privacy and weakening their cybersecurity isn’t exactly ‘draining the swamp.’ ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:50:06.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
