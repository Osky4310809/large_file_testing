Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2017 \nTrump delivered some brief comments in the Oval Office on Friday and, when asked about the Freedom Caucus, he said he was “disappointed” that this group of Republicans opposed the legislation. \nThe caucus did oppose the AHCA, but there were Republicans outside that group who came out against the bill as well. \nThis morning on Twitter, Trump, while not outright attacking the Freedom Caucus, this time said that Democrats are “smiling” because of their actions: Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare! \n— Donald J.
