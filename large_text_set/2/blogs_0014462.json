The pair tied the knot in April 2013, and have two children, daughters Phoebe and Dulcie. While the duo has a habit of keeping their relationship private, the few times they've hit a red carpet together are enough to make you swoon. Like many other celebrity duos , they even have a signature pose. Jamie and Amelia will stand next to each other, ignore the flashing cameras, and gaze lovingly into each other's eyes. Now that Fifty Shades Darker has been released, hopefully we'll get to see more of Jamie and Amelia soon!
