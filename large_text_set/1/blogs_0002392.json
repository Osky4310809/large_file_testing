Think twice.\nNow a harrowing video released by Leicester police with the support of Haywood's family re-construct the last two weeks of her life with the purpose of educating and warning teenagers of the dangers of online grooming.\n(Warning: The following video may be distressing for some.)\nIn the five-minute film, Haywood is seen chatting online with 28-year-old Luke Harlow, whom she agreed to meet after more than 2,600 messages over the course of 13 days.\n\"Hey, how are you?\" Harlow told Haywood via Facebook, to which she replied \"Fine - who are you?\nHarlow was grooming Haywood along with two other girls he had also been chatting to.\nAfter telling her parents she was staying at a friend's house, Haywood spent the night at Harlow's house. She was held for two days against her will by the man and his neighbour, 29-year-old Stephen Beadman.\nShe tried to flee but was recaptured by Beadman, who raped and murdered her.\nIn July 2016, Beadman was convicted of rape, murder and false imprisonment and jailed for at least 35 years. Harlow was given a 12-year prison sentence.\n\"Kayleigh’s Love Story is as a warning to young people, both girls and boys, about the dangers of speaking to people they don’t know online,\" Leicester Police said .\n\"The film highlights just how quick and easy it can be for children to be groomed online without them or those around them knowing it is happening. Its purpose is to protect children now and in the future and to stop another family losing a child in this way.\"\nThe film will be shown to schoolchildren across the country to stress the importance of staying safe online.\nPolice have also produced a fact sheet for parents that contains information about online grooming and the tell-tale signs and behaviours.\nWatch: How girls are subjected to child marriage", "external_links": ["https://leics.police.uk/categories/kayleighs-love-story", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/lcwytQr8.m3u8", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-36606210", "https://leics.police.uk/media/uploads/library/file/Kayleighs_Love_Story_fact_sheet_2016_no_crop.pdf", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/lcwytQr8.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-04T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T12:51:54.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
