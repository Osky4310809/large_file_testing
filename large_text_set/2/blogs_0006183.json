Mikko Rantanen ‘s first career hat trick was the highlight and Calvin Pickard had 27 saves for his second shutout of the season as the Avalanche (15-33-2) gained a bit of redemption for a 10-1 loss in Montreal on Dec. 10. \n“When you’re younger, you watch guys score hat tricks and the crowd is going wild,” said Rantanen, the 20-year-old Finnish winger. “So it’s a dream come true. But the most important thing still was the two points.” \nOnly 30 seconds into the game, Rantanen beat Canadiens goalie Carey Price with a less-than-howitzer shot near the right-wing boards and Andreas Martinsen made it 2-0 at 2:25. Rantanen’s second goal was on a deflection of former Canadiens defenseman Mark Barberio’s shot at 13:10 of the second period, and the third for Rantanen came on a one-timer from the lower edge of the right circle on a 5-on-3 at 6:01 of the third.
