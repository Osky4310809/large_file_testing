And, right now, it seems like Mondalez International is the one setting it ablaze. \nFirst, the company cut the weight of Toblerone – crucially, without reducing the price. People were furious. \nAnd now another adored confectionery staple is going to be blighted by the relentless hand of the corporation: the manufacturer is raising the price of our chocolate frogs. Yes, our beloved Freddo treats are going up in price. Again. Mondelez, then operating as Kraft, took over Cadbury in 2010 (Photo: Mondelez International / PA) \nIt's expected that Cadbury Freddo bars will cost you 30p from spring this year. That's a 20 per cent increase from the already extortionate sum of 25p. \nLet's not forget that Freddos have also shrunk in weight over the years. They're now just 12g. This is a disgrace, quite frankly \nA Mondelez spokesperson declined to discuss specific brands, but confirmed to the Guardian that 2017 would see \"selective\" price increases across its range. \nThe confectionery giant reported profits of £450m in its last financial quarter. \n\"Increasing prices is always a last resort, but to ensure we can keep people’s favourite brands on shelf and look after the 4,500 people we employ in the UK, we are having to make some selective price increases across our range,\" a spokesman for Mondelez said. \nThe company bought Cadbury in 2010. It's implemented numerous changes – amplified, it appears, in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the EU. \nMaltesers were downsized after Toblerone. The bags are now 15 per cent lighter. Freddo is next.
