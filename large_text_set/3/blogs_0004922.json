It’s one of the most actionable, information-packed interviews I’ve ever done. \nThis time, it’s Joel Stein ( @TheJoelStein ) asking the questions. Joel is one of the funniest writers I have ever read, and he’s great at leading an interview. \nHere’s how it all happened: I have many different conversations with journalists. It can be painful when I have a 1-2 hour conversation, and then it’s cut to a single sentence as a quote in a piece. And it’s often a misquote. So how do you fix that? Well, you record it yourself, which is how this episode was created. (With the interviewer’s approval, of course.) This way, you don’t “lose” the content, and you cover your ass with media and journalists. \nJoel wanted me to help him figure out 5 areas he could upgrade in his own life for a series on self-improvement. In this episode, we discuss a wide variety of topics, including: How I choose what to improve from infinite options How you can subtract your way to success The genius of Ben Franklin Why self-improvement doesn’t mean self-centered How I say no to time-consuming lunches, coffees, and other meetings How I tackle cold introductions How I surmounted Lyme Disease My 100% complete break from start-ups ( read this for more ) My podcast process Tools and tactics for reversing email overwhelm \nIf you want help reducing anxiety and don’t have time for the entire episode, listen to this short segment . \nEnjoy!
