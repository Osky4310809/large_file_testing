This road is unable to travel without the years that we had with Michael Vick under center. What he gave to this team this city was something unlike anything we had experienced before. Even wth a World Series championship in 1995 I think we can all agree that nothing compared to Michael in the dome on Sundays. The dome era is closing and we had Michael there to say goodbye but after reading his memoir in the players tribune it has become abundantly clear how he felt about us all along. He loved us more than we ever could love him. He is one of us not a eagle or a jet or a steeler. He's ours. Let him leave the game the way he came as a Atlanta Falcon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:00:34.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
