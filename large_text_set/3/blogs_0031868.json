And, as per this fluffy bit of floof from People about the state of their relations, it’s going great. \nAdvertisement \n\nI engaged with this link hoping for something a little dishy—cheating rumors or fights or artistic differences on the set of Mother!, a film that Aronofsky directed, starring Lawrence. Unfortunately, there’s nothing untoward to report, though I appreciate People calling out their 22-year old age difference at the top —they’re “living by the motto that age is just a number” —before assuring an anxious readership that despite that, they’re hanging in there and “getting serious.” Honestly, I’m not even sure what defines “serious” anymore as it relates to celebrity relationships, but I’ll take People ’s word for it\nThe key to their success is the fact that Lawrence is “mature and focused,” while also having been “mesmerized by his talent and brains.” They’re also “sweet together” and they “seem happy.” Oh, and “they hold hands.” Sounds nice. \nAdvertisement \n\n“I don’t know how far it will go but as of now they are a really good match, two talented people who love their work and are respected for it,” People ’s source said. Wait a minute, that’s a lot of backtracking for two people who are “happy,” don’t you think? Oh well! They’re still together. Congrats to them. \n[ People ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:19:22.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
