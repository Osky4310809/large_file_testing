Ram and Sakshi became instantly popular due to their warm and relatable chemistry in the show, and therefore the makers have planned to cast them opposite each other again. \nThe show, Kar Le Tu Bhi Mohabbat, is the first one to be launched by Ekta’s Balaji ALT productions, who are also producing several other shows meant for the digital space. Ram plays a superstar in the series, who visits a counsellor (played by Sakshi) to sort out his problems. He is in a dysfunctional relationship with his wife and eventually gets attracted to the counsellor even though they have different personalities. The series is reportedly filled with double meaning jokes and deals with various adult issues as well.
