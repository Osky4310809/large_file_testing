It was a game that many sports fans will never forget. You also may remember that the Falcons went into the locker room at half up 21-3 with all the momentum . \nThen, the halftime show happened. \nThe Super Bowl halftime show, which featured Lady Gaga, made for a 30-minute halftime compared to the 12-minute intermission in the regular season. Falcons wide receiver Mohamed Sanu said the long layoff contributed to the epic Super Bowl meltdown. \nSanu said on NFL Network's Good Morning Football on Friday when asked about the halftime show's negative effect: \n\"It definitely did. Because usually, halftime is only like 15 minutes, and when you're not on the field for like an hour, it's just like going to work out - like a great workout, and you go sit on the couch for an hour and then try to start working out again.\" \nObviously, the Falcons and Patriots both had to deal with the same longer halftime, and the Falcons ended up extending their lead in the third quarter. \nSanu added that it wasn't something that could be simulated in practice because the energy of the Super Bowl is impossible to replicate.
