It’s no surprise then that the pop star hasn’t shied away from voicing her political opinion—especially through her sartorial statements. Last night at the Grammys, Perry gave a pointed political performance of her new song Chained to the Rhythm , wearing a “persist” armband and a suffragette white pantsuit—every element of her outfit was a shout out to Senator Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton. Perry isn’t stopping on the stage with her support of HRC. The singer is also launching a line of killer kicks dubbed (dropping on February 16). With each shoe named after a badass woman in Perry’s life, Katy Perry Collections delivers big on girl power.

There’s the Cleo, a platform mule with a cigar-style heel; the Lena (as in Girls creator Lena Dunham), a sparkly AF vintage style trainer; the A.W. (after Allison Williams), a patent leather pump with an understated tie-dye heel; and the Hillary, a regal pink pump with suspended stars in the solid clear heel. “It’s got stars in the heel, so it’s a pep in her step,” Perry said of the White House-ready classic silhouette in an interview with People . \nThe Hillary from the Katy Perry Collection Courtesy of Katy Perry Collection Naturally, the funky line is totally in step with Perry’s break-the-mold, girl power style. “I chose some of my favorite girlfriends and my female family members and named all the shoes after them,” she said. “I didn’t necessarily shape the shoe after them, but…I tried to pair the shoes that best represented their personality.” Perry, who campaigned heavily for HRC, has continued to be vocal of her support for women’s empowerment. Before her performance, she told E! News viewers should “pay close attention to the narrative.” Based on her shoe game alone, we have a feeling Perry’s style narrative will include lots more empowering moments to come.
