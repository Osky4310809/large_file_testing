When we somehow convinced the team at the NHM to let us invade for one night, Cypher16 was not only the first heavy rock band to ever conduct a full-scale shoot both outside and inside the Hintze Hall, but the shoot became one of the last projects to film with Dippy the Dinosaur before he left the museum for his extended tour. \nWe knew we would have to bring in a great film and direction team to help us make it a reality. Enter Ben, Bez and crew at Sitcom Soldiers, who brought their vision, enthusiasm and expertise and really made it all happen! I hope you all enjoy watching it our 'night at the museum' as much as we enjoyed making it, although I won't deny, it was one of the longest nights of my life!” \nCypher16 melds modern European heavy metal riffage with unforgettable alternative rock-inspired choruses, generating a truly multi-faceted and unpredictable auditory attack. \nCypher16 have risen up the ranks in their native UK throughout the last few years, amassing a devoted following which has afforded them the opportunity to perform at numerous festivals around the world (including India and China), and to catch the eyes and ears of reputable music publications and tastemakers. The band released their latest album – the hooky, symphonic metal-tinged alt-rock offering The Great Surveyor (recorded by renowned producer Romesh Dodangoda [Motörhead, Bullet For My Valentine, Funeral For A Friend]) – in 2015. \nThe Great Surveyor is available via Amazon here .
