It comes a day after Trump issued an ultimatum to House Republicans to vote for the bill or live with Obamacare. \nA leadership aide said that Trump and Ryan spoke by phone at 3 p.m. and that the president asked the speaker to pull the bill. \nTrump has staked his early presidency on repealing and replacing Obamacare, embracing his image as a dealmaker and closer throughout the process. House leaders were happy to oblige as well, referring to Trump as “the ultimate closer” as he met with reluctant House members. \nSo much for the Greatest Dealmaker in the History of the Known Universe myth. Trump’s “Friday or never” ultimatum was a negotiating tactic and those who oppose the bill, both the moderates and the far-right extremists, called his bluff. And isn’t it fascinating how the House managed to pass a bill to repeal Obamacare more than 60 times while Obama was in office but can’t pass one now that they know it would actually become law and they’d be responsible for it?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T08:39:16.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
