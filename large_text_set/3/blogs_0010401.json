By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 12, 2017 10:20 AM While the Congress got 17 , seats, it was followed by BJP with 13 in the results for the 40-member Assembly declared yesterday. (PTI) \nDay after Goa poll results showed hung Assembly both BJP and Congress are trying to gain support from other smaller parties as well as independents to form the government, a report by Times Now has said. While the Congress got 17 , seats, it was followed by BJP with 13 in the results for the 40-member Assembly declared yesterday. \nAs per the report, the Goa Forward Party (GFP) may extend support to Congress to form Government in the state. The BJP on the other hand may also expect support from two independent legislatures. The BJP leaders are also expected to meet Goa Governor Mridula Sinha today \nSpeaking on Goa results yesterday, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had said that things were not all dark for the party. \nThe BJP has been running neck and neck against the Congress party which has made surprisingly good gains despite being drubbed everywhere except in Punjab where the victory (it won 77 seats out of 117) was ascribed more to Captain Amarinder Singh’s efforts than the campaigns of party Vice President Rahul Gandhi . \nIn Goa, the BJP was not able to strategise or deploy the charismatic energy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi or his strategist, party president Amit Shah and this allowed the Congress to claw itself back from a certain losing position as seen ahead of counting day. In Goa, the BJP has won just 13 of 17 seats and finds itself in a minority. However, the hope that Parrikar was talking about were in the form of the 10 independent candidates who had won. Clearly, he was saying that the BJP would be approaching them to bolster its count and take it past that of the Congress. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nWhile Parrikar did not comment at all about the possibility of his coming back to state politics, especially as the current chief minister Parsekar has been defeated today, he did indicate the party’s next likely step. He said, “Party will stake claim if it gets enough support.” Parrikar is known to prefer state politics over his stay at the Centre. Parrikar added, “We don’t try to pass on the buck; we are all responsible for the fractured mandate.” Please Wait while comments are loading...
