Now, it has released a new video showing the differences in design compared to the outgoing model, ahead of the car’s launch very soon – the order books having already been opened since the beginning of the month. \nThis makes it much easier to spot the differences, which include redesigned headlights – now LED units on the top-spec V variant – with a different shape. The chrome bar, which now extends over the headlights Civic -style, is also slimmer than before, while the grille features a honeycomb mesh and a chrome strip. The front bumper has also been given a more elegant design. \nAt the rear, the V model gains LED tail lights as seen on the Japanese-market Grace Hybrid , and there’s also a sportier rear bumper and a ducktail spoiler with an integrated LED third brake light. Finishing it off are new two-tone alloy wheels, measuring 16 inches on the V, as well as the new Lunar Silver hue from the Civic. \nAs before, Honda has not shown the interior of the facelifted City, but we should get the darker gunmetal trim, redesigned seat fabric (with the Civic’s centre stripe) and LED map and room lights offered on Thai and Indian models. All models now get keyless entry and push-button start, while the V variant finally receives a multi-angle reverse camera and auto-folding door mirrors. \nAll models retain the 1.5 litre i-VTEC four-cylinder engine, mated to an Earth Dreams CVT transmission; although outputs have yet to be announced, expect them to stay the same at 120 PS and 145 Nm. Safety-wise, all models now come with Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), with the V variant adding six airbags as before. The model lineup will also be streamlined from four variants (S, S+, E and V) to three (S, E and V).
