Traditions of International Conversations, vocabulary and protocols has been evolved by the graduates of top Universities. Well, that is appreciated but sometimes you need to call a spade a spade. That is what Trump is doing and I like that.\nI will go a step further and will request Indian politicians that they should learn something from POTUS. Instead of wrapping your words into philosophical and cultural mythology combined with storytelling; you should learn to come out with your clear stand on various issues concerning the nation.\nLet us take the example of ban on seven countries for a short duration of time. Try to think of a similar situation in the Indian context. If all the attacks, conspiracies and vandalism against your village happening for many years are being orchestrated by the people originating from a particular village then how you as a Sarpanch of that village react to the people from that village. Nobody from your village will establish a matrimonial relationship with the family of that village. Nobody will hire the people from that village for farming and other jobs. Nobody will call the players from that village to play with them in the competitions. It will be a kind of unstated social boycott of that village along with other measures to protect your village.\nHowever, there is a catch here. If the general public of that village strongly opposes those criminals or terrorists, then the situation will be different. In that case the good people from both the villages will unite and try to overcome the evil forces.\nBut in the case of banned nations or communities which are put under scanner; it is very ironic that no one from the peace-loving majority openly condemns terrorist organisations and tries to take some initiatives to stop these tendencies of the youth to take extreme path of terror. The silence and inaction of good people from these banned nations and communities in preventing the youth to adopt such destructive philosophy like ISIS is most shocking. In that case no one has any right to stop Trump in protecting his own nation from such people.\nMany CEOs, Officials and organisations are talking of the difficulties being faced by the genuine people due to these executive orders of Trump. Was it not the responsibility of these people who have reached to the highest positions or working for top tech companies; to act proactively with their community leaders to stop such practices and elements which are luring their youth into extremist activities. Silence of the elders and leaders of these banned nations is more alarming than the actions of Trump. In some cases the preachers of these communities has been found to be themselves\ninvolved in spreading hatred and propagating hate content. Has these communities risen up and voiced their concerns against these people. Did these communities tried to socially boycott such people. It makes everyone else believe that either they are too selfish to speak out or they are also supporting the acts of those young terrorists and their backers who are originating from their countries and communities. In both ways, they deserve to face such consequences as outlined by Trump.\nSimilarly, whether it is the issue of Iran or South China Sea or North Korea or Pakistan, we have seen that soft diplomacy, in the last few decades, has failed to produce results. But these countries are still going ahead with their expansionist and destructive ideologies. We should appreciate the statements of Trump, which are the true picture based on the facts of current state of affairs. In fact, India needs to come more openly regarding its stand on China in context of different issues. India has more stakes being a close neighbour to many of these countries. So, it is time that NaMo quickly learns few tips from Trump and stops issue-based reactions to China, and rather come out with a comprehensive policy to deal China.\nI will also complement Trump on H1-B Visa issue. We should try to see it from the American perspective. For any country it is paramount to secure their own interests. Salary threshold for H1B workers was set more than three decades ago and it is not suitable as far as the salary packages for higher order skills of todays are concerned. So, it is in the interest of the highly skilled workers, that they are paid their rightful salaries. IT companies of other nations were actually misusing the provisions of H1-B Visa and trying to make profits out of it. We should not see it from the narrow perspective of short term gains in Indian share market, but look at it from the world view perspective.\nWe can always say that Trump can be a little more balanced when speaking or tweeting, but every human being has unique traits. We cannot expect Trump to change his habits at this age. We should look beyond the words and see his intentions. Till now, I have found him doing a good job in the right direction. Whenever you try to do something right; there will always be some genuine people who will face the difficulties in the short term. We need to bear with such consequences in the short term for long term gains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:00:37.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
