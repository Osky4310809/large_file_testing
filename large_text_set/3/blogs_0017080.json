(JIM_BOURG/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, March 20, 2017, 9:32 AM \nJust hours before FBI Director James Comey was scheduled to deliver testimony regarding Russian efforts to meddle in last year's election, President Trump took to Twitter to accuse Democrats of fabricating the allegations. \n\"The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!\" Trump tweeted just after 6:30 a.m. \n\"James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!\" he added. \nComey to reveal whether FBI is probing Trump for Russia ties \nAn hour later, Trump went off-topic, tweeting about CNN. FBI Director James Comey (pictured), as well as National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, are scheduled to testify and their comments could be politically toxic for the Trump White House. (Stephan Savoia/AP) \n\"Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox,\" he wrote. \nThe tweets came just hours before the first public hearing of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian interference in the election was slated to kick off.
