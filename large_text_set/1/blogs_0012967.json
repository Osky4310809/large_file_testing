The relocation is all but complete, with the last pod currently in the final stage of being shifted 23km to the new site. \nThe move was necessitated by a chasm that had opened up in the shelf and which threatened to cut off Halley. But this huge fissure to the west of the station is not the cause of the temporary closure. \nRather, it is another break in the ice some 17km to the east of the base dubbed the \"Halloween Crack\" because it was discovered on 31 October. \n\"Changes to the ice, particularly the growth of a new crack, presents a complex glaciological picture that means that BAS scientists are unable to predict with certainty what will happen to the ice shelf during the forthcoming Antarctic winter,\" the research organisation said in a statement. \n\"As a precautionary measure, BAS will remove its people before the Antarctic winter begins.\" \nand follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T18:59:55.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
