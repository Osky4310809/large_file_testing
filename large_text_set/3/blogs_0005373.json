(AP/KDKA) – President Donald Trump is accusing former President Barack Obama of having Trump’s telephones “wire tapped” during last year’s election, but Trump isn’t offering any evidence or saying what prompted the allegation. \nTrump says in a series of tweets that he “just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower.” Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 \nCBS News reported that an Obama spokesperson released the following statement in response to Trump’s allegations: \n“A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.” \nTrump’s tweets could be in response to Democrat’s outcry following revelations that Attorney General Jeff Sessions – in his confirmation hearings – didn’t disclose his contacts with Russia’s American ambassador during the campaign. Sessions – a senator at that time – was Trump’s earliest Senate supporter. \nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia influenced the election to help Trump win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T06:00:12.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
