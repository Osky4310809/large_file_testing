Thomas touched the flag-draped coffin of her Green Beret husband, it was a private moment of saying good-bye not to a hero, but to a loved one. \nWhen Lisa Williams filmed that moment as she waited on an airplane at North Carolina’s Raleigh-Durham Airport on Tuesday, the simple act of a black-clad widow touching the nation’s colors struck a chord with thousands of Americans.   Trump Commended For His Effect On The Troops \nWilliams said that when the plane landed, passengers were asked to stay in their seats. \nSoldiers then unloaded a flag-draped coffin from the plane’s cargo area. Thomas, the widow of Officer Shawn Thomas, stepped off the plane as he made his final journey home. \n“It was an honor to fly home with this PATRIOT! God bless his wife and family. There was not a dry eye around me,” Williams wrote on a Facebook post.   \nSeven Green Berets served as an honor guard for their fallen comrade, who had died in a non-combat-related crash in Niger, where Green Berets had been sent to train local troops and residents in the fight against terrorism. \nThe video Williams posted had been viewed more than 6 million times as of Friday, and many thanked her for posting it. \n“Thank you for posting this video of my friend making it home, my heart breaks for his family but I’m glad he’s there now,” Mick Collins posted.   Defense Secretary Mattis Tells Nato It Must Commit To Increased Defense Spending \n“Thank you for posting this beautiful video of one of our soldiers coming home. Your tears were a comforting sound amongst the cries of the liberals who do not understand the sacrifices our military makes on a daily basis. God Bless you for sharing,” commented Trish Tanner. \n“My brother is military, he had to be the guard for a friend that he lost in Iraq. Seeing like this, knowing what my brother had to do for his friend, that’s tough. I prayed for this family right away. I pray for all soldiers safety. God bless you for filming this and being so completely overcome by sorrow and compassion,” posted Angela Davis Britton. \nThomas, who had been stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C., had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan seven times and earned two Bronze stars, four Good Conduct Medals and was posthumously awarded the Meritorious Service Medal and Army Commendation Medal for his work in central Africa. \nHe was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.
