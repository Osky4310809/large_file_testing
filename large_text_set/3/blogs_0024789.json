Who's to blame depends on how you look at it. All of the documents would have been uploaded by the owner, but may not have realized that each document could be made public, which is Docs.com's default uploading setting, say compared to files created or edited with Word and Excel Online, which are private until set otherwise. \nBut by Microsoft's effort to pull the search feature for now shows there's some responsibility on the software giant's part. \nMicrosoft did not comment at the time of writing. If that changes, we'll update. ZDNET INVESTIGATIONS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T04:47:11.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
