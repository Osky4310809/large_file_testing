Not a very good one, way too dramatic. \n\"Such blatant cheating with this hand on the throat, look of agony. Bulls**t. \n\"This is football porn. Kids should not be allowed to watch.\" \nSuarez was not the only player to incur the Frenchman's wrath - Cantona also took aim at Manchester City following their Champions League exit at the hands of Monaco. \nHe specifically targeted defender John Stones, joking that the reason he cost £50 million is because he arrived with a \"fully equipped trailer\" behind him. \n\"Manchester City's defence are not the only ones to blame for their very own infamous Brexit,\" he said. \n\"We know now why John Stones was so expensive – because he comes with a fully equipped trailer that he pulls behind him when he plays. \n\"The question now is not who is going to leave when the summer comes, but rather, who is going to stay?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:53:26.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
