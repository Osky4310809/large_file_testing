We weren’t expecting it to happen,” said witness Osman Yageiou. \nTwo residents of the home made it out, but the grim faces of firefighters at the scene told the rest of the story. \n“This puts the reality in it,” said Deputy Chief Quinn. “It gives you a punch in the face to see this happen.” Black bunting is draped over station doors at Watertown Fire Department after a firefighter’s death.

In 2015, 60 firefighters died from stress or overexertion with 54 of those deaths due to heart attacks. \nThe last line of duty firefighter death in Massachusetts was when Lt. Edward Walsh and firefighter Michael Kennedy were killed battling heavy flames on Beacon Street in March 2014. \nWBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Kim Tunnicliffe reports \nFull statement from Toscano family: \n“Our family is devastated by the loss we suffered today as our loving husband and father was taken from us suddenly while responding to a fire. Joe took immense pride and joy in being a husband to Maureen, his wife of 25 years, and dad to Alyssa, Patrick, Mary Cate, William and Michael. You can see Joe’s warmth, kindness, curiosity for life and love of the outdoors reflected in his five extraordinary children. Family was at the center of Joe’s life and defined him. Along with being an exceptional husband, father, brother, uncle, son-in-law and friend to many, Joe loved being a Watertown Firefighter. \n“Joe was a master craftsman. He built the home he shared with his family with his own hands. A gourmet chef, Joe was known for his pizzas and his special mussels dish and was the unofficial Watertown Fire Station chef. Joe always made time for you — regardless of what he was doing. He was a man of great integrity and honor. Joe’s work ethic, generosity and kindness touched everyone he knew. He was a dedicated and energetic volunteer at Incarnation Camp of Connecticut, which he attended as a child and worked at as an adult for nearly four decades. \n“This is an unthinkable loss for our family. Joe’s loving spirit will be with us forever.” Beth Germano Follow Follow Beth on Twitter Emmy award-winning Beth Germano is a general assignment reporter for WBZ-TV News.
