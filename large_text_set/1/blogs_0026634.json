(Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) A group of Virginia Tech graduates have asked President Trump to remove a fellow alumnus, Stephen K. Bannon, from his leadership role in the new administration.\nBannon, Trump’s chief political strategist who also has a major role in national security policy, has long been a polarizing figure, with strong views well known from his leadership of Breitbart News.\n[ For Trump adviser, fiery populism followed life in elite circles ]\nThe petition is not associated with the university itself but was initiated by a small group of alumni Saturday night. By Monday afternoon, it had been signed by nearly 4,000 people representing themselves as students, faculty, staff and alumni.\nThe petition questions Bannon, who during his tenure at Virginia Tech served as president of the student government association. It reads in part, “What makes Virginia Tech so unique is its carefully nurtured environment of community. … Though he is an alumnus of Virginia Tech, Stephen Bannon sticks out as an aberration. He does not represent our values — he stands in opposition to them.”\nAmong the reasons the petition cites were that under Bannon’s leadership, Breitbart News has been “a mouthpiece for the white nationalist ‘alt-right’ movement,” with articles disparaging women, Muslims and others, they wrote. “His views are sinister and reckless and disqualify him to advise the leadership of any modern society. … We, the undersigned, unequivocally denounce Mr. Bannon and call on President Trump to disavow and dismiss this man from his administration.”\nA spokeswoman for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.\n[ Questions multiply over Bannon’s role in Trump administration ]\nThe Collegiate Times , the student newspaper at Virginia Tech, ran the petition as an op-ed. As people read it there, and shared it on social media, some wrote strong responses.\nSome urged the petition writers to check their facts with some of the complaints they made about Bannon, saying the information came from mainstream media and was incorrect.\nOne woman wrote, “Proud to be a HOKIE and proud to be a supporter of Bannon and Trump!!”\n“Please don’t speak for all of us,” she wrote. “You are entitled to your opinion but there are millions of Hokies out there with many different views on this matter. That’s what makes VT great.”\nCharlie Petty, a 2011 graduate working in private equity in Boston who was one of several organizers, said a lot of the negative comments were references to the Ivory Tower, the coastal elite. “If you look at the people who signed it, there are people who work in the cafeteria at Virginia Tech,” staff members and all different parts of the larger Virginia Tech community. “It’s not a group of liberal students. It’s a broader message.”\n[ Steve Bannon once suggested only property holders should vote. What would that look like? ]\nVirginia Tech (Associated Press)", "external_links": ["http://www.collegiatetimes.com/opinion/op-ed-virginia-tech-community-letter-to-disavow-the-appointment/article_26326a50-e673-11e6-a268-874923cbfb2c.html", "https://twitter.com/@SusanSvrluga", "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGU8H7q-VTSyf3UQ9a9j4WLqJ0RcDmW3E-00ql3K4RApwkxQ/viewform?c=0&w=1"], "published": "2017-01-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:18:52.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
