Imagine has 30,000 students nationwide.\nThe school at 2750 Hartwood Marsh Road, in its 11th year, also received the Imagine Schools National Award for Character Development and Parent Choice along with both the Five-Star School and Golden School awards from the state Department of Education based on the school's excellence in family involvement, volunteerism, student community service, school advisory councils and business partnerships.\nThe only other A-rated schools in Lake are Round Lake Elementary School in Mount Dora and The Villages Elementary of Lady Lake School.\nImagine Schools of South Lake Principal Kathleen Dial said the awards from Imagine's network were earned for the school's excellent performance in academics, character education, parent choice, school development, shared values, and economic sustainability.\nThe awards are based not only on school performance, but also on survey data from parents, teachers and students. These awards come just after the school was honored by www.Character.org as one of 68 schools recognized annually as a National School of Character.\n\"We are so proud and passionate here, and we feel that developing kids' moral character is as important as their academic education,\" said Dial, who added she knows each of her students by name. \"The parents and teachers know that it is a very special place here.\"\nThe school is home to 1,030 students who stay in the same facility until high school, which helps create a seamless transition and shows up as improved academic performance. Students begin changing classes in the fifth grade during the day with the same homeroom group to give them an introduction into how middle school operates.\n\"They know their peers, their routines and their environment, and they do not have to repeatedly be at the bottom rung of the ladder changing schools prior to high school,\" she said.\nAs a public charter school, Dial said the school's curriculum meets Lake County's and the state's requirements. In addition, she said, there is a strong focus on character education which offers lessons that change each month, focusing on positive choices in citizenship, integrity, caring, respect, responsibility and trustworthiness.\n\"We prepare kids for the tests of life, not a life of tests,\" Dial said. \"Now, more than ever, schools are in a position to make a change in the world.\"\nAll three of Paula Anderson's children — eighth-grader student Lilly, fifth-grader Haden and fourth-grader Bradley — have attended Imagine since they started as kindergarteners, and Anderson said she is grateful for having had the choice.\n\"We chose Imagine because it offers a K to 8 setting and is a smaller, more personal environment. We came to love Imagine for their focus on academics and the growth of students as individuals. The staff and leadership care about my kids and make our school feel like a family,\" she said.\nAs a public charter school, Dial said the school's curriculum is in accordance with Lake district requirements, the State Board of Education and Imagine's authorizing school board. Along with academic requirements, there is a strong focus on character education which offers lessons that change each month focusing on positive choices in citizenship, integrity, caring, respect, responsibility and trustworthiness.\nShe attributed the school's success to its dedication to developing the whole child while having fun doing it.\n\"We always hear people say when they enter a classroom how happy the kids are. The students are engaged and learning through many projects and activities,\" Dial said. \"We believe if we teach standards and make them engaging, they will do fine on the tests.\"\nAnd a collaborative approach with parents and teachers is paramount, she said.\n\"We place a lot of emphasis on parent partnership. They are so important in their child's academic success as they develop their child's mind and heart, and teachers have the biggest impact on a child's education,\" Dial said. \"The kids feel important here and they are known and loved.\"\n Charter Schools", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5889120b/turbine/os-lk-imagine-school-south-lake-20170125"], "published": "2017-01-25T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:18:10.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
