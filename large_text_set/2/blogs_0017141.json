Warning ominously of “mass deportations,” the press is characterizing Trump’s order and new DHS policy as a pre-empt to a military-aided deportation effort that will consist of dramatic raids on millions of unsuspecting illegals all over the country. While the Trump administration could lawfully round up and deport those living here illegally, there is no evidence such an effort is in fact underway. \nA more accurate description of the instructions given to DHS officials is that explicit authority to detain and possibly deport any illegal immigrant they encounter has been returned to them, in accordance with the law. While any illegal immigrant on their radar could be deported, the administration will prioritize removal of criminal illegal immigrants. The order certainly increases the chances of getting deported for some illegal immigrants, the vast majority of which put themselves at risk when the chose to cross the border illegally or remain in the country illegally by overstaying travel or work visas. \n“President Trump has ordered me to reestablish control of the U.S. southern border,” Kelly said, warning Guatemalans they’re better off not trying to cross in future. “If you’re a Guatemalan who is considering paying a great deal of money to a coyote [smuggler] to bring you to the United States, you’ll be wasting our money,” he added. “You will be returned very quickly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:20:36.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
