The promotion sees Jain assume the title of vice president of Xiaomi while remaining the managing director of Xiaomi India.\n@manukumarjain , congratulations from the entire Xiaomi family on your promotion to Vice President of Xiaomi! pic.twitter.com/gxc1mfwPIK \n— Mi India (@XiaomiIndia) February 17, 2017 \n\nJain’s performance in India has been exceptional, taking Xiaomi to the number two spot in the sub-continent, but as a public face, is not as well known internationally as Barra. That said, Jain’s performance during the company’s expansion into India has made him a very recognizable and respected brand ambassador.\nJain has been with Xiaomi since 2014, before which he co-founded jabong.com, an online retail site. Barra, who was previously the vp of product development for the Android team, will assume his new post at Facebook this month at the helm of Oculus’ VR efforts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:40:19.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
