European Commission 'agrees £48bn Brexit divorce bill' \nThe view appeared to open up a split with David Jones, a minister in the Brexit department, who welcomed the ‘no exit fee’ argument – first put forward in an explosive House of Lords report. \nMr Jones said: “Certainly the House of Lords committee report was extremely helpful. I’m sure it’s not gone unnoticed in Brussels and in other European capitals.” \nThe split came as Sir Tim gave an update verdict on the prospects for Britain agreeing a framework for future trade with the EU within the two years of the Article 50 negotiations, to start next month. \nHis predecessor, Sir Ivan Rogers – who quit abruptly in January, condemning the Government’s “muddled thinking” – warned it would take until the mid-2020s to achieve a free trade deal. \nBut Sir Tim said such “speculation” was based on the difficulty of striking deals between countries with very different trade systems, when Britain and the EU already had “convergence”. \n“On the first day after withdrawal there will be convergence – we are creating something different,” he told the Commons European Scrutiny Committee. \n“Our mandate is clear to get on with it. There’s a timetable that everybody has bought into included in the treaty and that’s what we are going to do.” \nThe Article 50 process clearly stated that the EU should take account of its “future framework” with the UK, as well as agree the exit deal. \nMr Jones agreed David Jones agreed that the UK was at a “huge advantage” in negotiating a trade deal because its current arrangements were “already in alignment” with the bloc’s standards.
