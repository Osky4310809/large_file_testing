Groupon created a nail polish made with real Prosecco that tastes and smells like the bubbly beverage.\nAccording to the official website, the alcohol-infused polish will launch in honor of Mother's Day . In addition to tasting like it, the polish pretty much looks like a glass of Prosecco with its metallic gold hue and sparkly finish when applied.\nRelated:\nThe Wire Nail Art Trend Makes \"Getting Bent\" a Good Thing\nThere is, however, a catch: the polish will not be for sale online. To snag a bottle, you'll have to enter Groupon's sweepstakes by clicking \"buy\" and following the ensuing prompts. The other caveat? The fine print states that the prize will only be granted to Groupon users with UK addresses.\nIt's also worth noting that just because it tastes like sparkling wine doesn't mean you should drink the polish straight from the bottle. That would be bad. Similarly, you might not want to go around licking your nail polish if your hands have been touching a lot of other surfaces all day.\nIf you're curious — we don't blame you — check out Groupon's video demonstrating the product above.", "external_links": ["https://www.groupon.co.uk/pages/prosecconails-tandc", "https://www.groupon.co.uk/deals/groupon-280?CID=UK_AFF_5600_225_5383_1&sid=30283X879131X9d69baa83904ee8db79aed1561ae9755&utm_medium=afl&utm_campaign=206711&mediaId=531&utm_source=GPN&subs_group=afl"], "published": "2017-03-21T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:34:19.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
