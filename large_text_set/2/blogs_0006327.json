The first one is called 'Betty Goes A-Posen.' \nBetty Boop, the flirty cartoon character who first batted her eyelashes onscreen in 1930, is back with a signature Pantone color (Betty Boop Red, natch), a Mac lipstick shade (also red), two dresses (you can guess the color) and three animations that feature the designer of those dresses, Zac Posen. USA TODAY can exclusively reveal the first of these new cartoons. \nIn the premiere short, called \"Zac Goes A-Posen,\" Betty Boop shows up in black-and-white New York City, flustered. Her cab spits her and her dog, Pudgy, out, and she's ruffled, until she hears a cry for help.
