Obama wipes a tear from his eye as he talks about Michelle pic.twitter.com/9oFoArIE8K — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) January 11, 2017 \nHe first spoke to his wife , saying, “Michelle Robinson, girl of the South Side. \n“For the past 25 years, you have not only been my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend. \n“You took on a role you didn’t ask for and you made it your own with grace and with grit and with grit and with style and good humour.” \nHe paused to wipe his eyes, before continuing: “You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody and a new generation sets it sights higher because it has you as a role model. \n“So you have made me proud and you have made the country proud.” \nThe roaring crowd gave Michelle a standing ovation. Charles Rex Arbogast/AP Barack Obama became visibly emotional when he spoke to his family during his farewell speech \nObama next addressed his daughter, Malia, who was sitting with her mother, as well as his daughter Sasha, who was not present because she had an exam the next morning. \nHe said: “Maria and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women. \n“You are smart and you are beautiful but more importantly you are kind and you are thoughtful and you are full of passion. \n“You wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. \n“Of all that I have done in my life, I’m most proud to be your dad.” WATCH: \"I am most proud to be your dad.\" Pres. Obama thanks daughters Sasha & Malia. #ObamaFarewell : https://t.co/xgkSCSwfcs pic.twitter.com/h7h14Ht3Cw — Good Morning America (@GMA) January 11, 2017 \nMany people watching also seemed to feel the emotion of his tributes to his family...
