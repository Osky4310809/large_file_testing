Not so! The administration has released a request for proposals seeking a contractor to take on the job of building his Shit Wall, with the deadline coming up on March 29.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nAccording to the RFP, which was released Friday by Customs and Border Protection, the wall will be 30 feet tall, sunk at least six feet into the ground and include 25 and 50 foot automated gates for pedestrians and vehicles. An initial proposal called for the wall to be made of solid concrete, though the request was later amended to include a potential see-through structure for “situational awareness.” \nWhatever material it winds up being, the design must be impenetrable by “sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery operated impact tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools” for at least 30 minutes. \nAdvertisement \n\nBut this wall isn’t all business—it’s supposed to be fun ! To that end, the RFP stipulates that the American side be “aesthetically pleasing in color,” allowing it to blend into the surrounding landscape. Will you be less morally offended by the wall if it features images of...what? Nature, which Scott Pruitt is intent on destroying? Americans from all backgrounds co-existing...nope, that’s not gonna work. It’ll have to be shapes, then. Some squares, a few rectangles, the occasional circle, like the waiting room of a dentist office in hell. Unsurprisingly, the aesthetics of the Mexican side were not mentioned. \nAround 700 contractors have already registered their interest in building the 1,900 mile wall, despite calls from the Mexican government that its national companies please “examine their conscience” before participating. From the Financial Times :\nLuis Videgaray, Mexico’s foreign minister, urged Mexican companies to think again before bidding and put their country first. Mexico has already ruled out paying for the wall, despite Mr Trump’s demands. \n“It is pertinent for any companies that see an economic opportunity in this to examine their conscience because we’re not talking about economics here, but a profoundly unfriendly act between two nations and we think this is a responsibility that falls to us all,” Mr Videgaray said. \nOnce the proposals are submitted, the government will solicit the construction of a handful of 30-foot-long prototypes, as well as 10-foot models for penetration tests, CNN reports .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:19:06.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
