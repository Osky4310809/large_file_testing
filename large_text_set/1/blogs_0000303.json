You don’t dismiss owners. I’m sorry… that’s the case…but that’s the facts.” \nAnd so long as York is the “owner” of the 49ers — he’s really just the team’s CEO, his mother owns the team and put him in charge — the 49ers will likely remain one of the NFL’s worst run franchises, and poorly run franchises don’t win in this league. \nYork said the franchise needs a culture change if it’s going to return to its once-winning ways — but that starts at the top, with him. \nMonday, York refused to admit that he made a mistake in firing Jim Harbaugh at the end of the 2014 season, that he woefully overestimated Jim Tomsula, who seemed closer to a man who won a contest than a viable NFL head coach, and that he made the wrong choice in maintaining Trent Baalke after the 2015 season, when he brought in Chip Kelly to be Tomsula’s successor. \nBut York was adamant that he was right to fire both Kelly and Baalke on Sunday, because now the 49ers will have a clean slate that will be attractive to head coaches and general managers alike. \nBut considering the dysfunction in Santa Clara — the 49ers are the first modern NFL team to fire coaches after first-year head coaches in back-to-backs seasons — what top-flight football mind would want to work with York? \nYork is right, he cannot be fired as the team’s CEO, but he could certainly take a backseat in the day-to-day operations of the team. And it certainly didn’t sound like York was interested in that kind of arrangement moving forward. \n“It’s got to be a partnership. It’s got to be a collaboration between me, the head coach and the general manager, so we can get this thing right.” \nA partnership between a general manager and a head coach could work in Santa Clara — the 49ers have money, some talent, and a lot of good draft picks coming up — but not so long as York demands that its a triumvirate of power. \nHe’s a meddler who is out of his depth, and he refuses to admit either fact. \nAnd without pause or smirk, he declared Monday “I don’t make football decisions.” \nIf that’s the case, why does York need to be part of a three-man partnership? \nYork is definitely the captain of a leaky boat, though. He is notorious for leaking information about Harbaugh to NFL news breakers (sometimes through a proxy, to be fair) when that relationship started heading south, creating justification for firing the coach who was well known to not think much of his much younger boss and his desire to interject in “football decisions.” \nAnd while it wasn’t York who leaked out Kelly and Baalke’s firing earlier this weekend, it was almost certainly one of the three men in that sentence, and Kelly was reportedly livid upon finding out he was being dismissed after one year. \nThough York did let the players know that Kelly was out via text, so we know the fingers are still working. \nThe 49ers do need a new culture, desperately, but the team’s culture wasn’t a byproduct of losing, losing was a byproduct of the 49ers’ culture. \nAnd York, more than anyone else in the organization, is responsible for fostering it. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T00:23:57.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
