Brian Barrett Gear   5:00 pm. 5:00 pm What the Snapdragon 835 Chip Means For Your Next Smartphone From left, last year’s Snapdragon 820, this year’s Snapdragon 835, and a teeny tiny penny. Qualcomm \nThe smartphone upgrade wishlist has remained largely unchanged over the last several years. Our handsets should be faster, and thinner, and eke out as much battery life as physics will allow. Qualcomm’s latest processor, the Snapdragon 835, lets device manufacturers check all of those boxes, but it also adds a healthy dollop of future to the mix. This is a processor built for next-generation connectivity, photography, and virtual reality—and it’s not just for smartphones. \nAnnounced at CES , the 835 is the latest in Qualcomm’s line of industry-dominant processors (Qualcomm chips are inside scores of Android phones, but not the iPhone, which Apple powers with its its homegrown guts.) And while its iterative improvements are certainly welcome, it’s the broader applications that may end up mattering most. Supercharged Smartphones \nThe Snapdragon 835’s secret sauce is its 10-nanometer process , a method of chip fabrication just making its way into the microprocessor industry. Using this new process, Qualcomm has been able to add performance and reduce battery drain in a package that’s 35 percent smaller than its predecessor, the 820. The exact speed gains aren’t clear, and will vary depending on the devices the chips end up in, but Qualcomm does claim up to 25 percent better 3-D graphics rendering compared to its previous flagship. \nThe company’s a little more clear on battery life, although your mileage there will vary as well. Qualcomm says the 835 slurps 25 percent less power than the 820, which means manufacturers can either slim down future smartphones without sacrificing longevity, or stand pat on the battery size but squeeze a precious few additional hours out of it. \nIf these promises sound familiar, it’s because they’re roughy the same every year. They also don’t necessarily always translate into noticeable gains. As smartphones mature, operating systems and apps demand more of them, and often internal improvements derive most of their value from simply keeping up. \nThat’s also what makes the Snapdragon 835’s other gains altogether more intriguing, if not necessarily impactful for many Android smartphone owners in the near term. Future Focus \nAugmented and virtual reality hasn’t quite yet broken into the mainstream, and there’s always the chance that it’ll join 3D televisions in the ever-widening heap of Next Big Things that never were. If it’s going to have a chance with consumers, though, chips like the 835 will be a major part of its success. \nIn addition to the 3-D graphics rendering improvements, the 835 supports 60 times more colors than its predecessor, object and scene-based 3D audio, and motion tracking that includes six degrees of freedom, the same number that you’ll find in an Oculus Rift head-mounted display. In practice, all of that translates to what you see on the screen lining up more seamlessly with your head movement, which helps minimize those queasy feelings. \nThere are camera improvements as well, with the usual promises of faster auto-focus and better HDR coupled with support for either a single 32-megapixel camera or two 16MP shooters. Qualcomm’s also boosted its QuickCharge capabilities, claiming 20 percent faster charging than last year’s version, but given Google’s open dislike of QuickCharge—it prefers USB-PD, a rival fast-battery-filling standard—it’s unclear how many devices will actually take advantage. \nAnd in one last eye-popping spec, the 835 will support Gigabit LTE. Yes, Gigabit. As in, way faster than what most people’s home Wi-Fi can manage. Those networks haven’t rolled out in any significant way yet, but when they do, they’re going to be critical for enabling VR and AR on the go. They’ll also, uh, obliterate your data plan. The future! Thinking Outside the Phone \nPart of enabling all of these future-focused features is working with futuristic hardware. At least, that’s the thinking behind one of the first non-smartphone Snapdragon 835 partners Qualcomm has announced. \nA company called ODG has put the mobile chip inside two pairs of of smart glasses. The R-8 and R-9 split the difference between Google Glass and something you’d actually want to wear, but it’s maybe best to think of them as a sort of Hololens for the not-quite-masses. Qualcomm \nWith the R-8, you can watch movies, read books, and play games not with your phone but with a faceputer, in high-definition and a field of view that’s greater than 40 degrees. It will cost “less than $1,000” when developer units ship in the second half of this year, which may sound expensive but isn’t, really, next to the $1,800 R-9. \nThe R-9 offers a 50-degree field of view, 1080p resolution, and seems intended for enterprise destinations rather than your living room when it ships in the second quarter of this year. \nThere are lots of roadblocks to the R-8 and R-9 catching on, from price to developer support to competition from major players like Microsoft to the still unproven notion that people are willing to look like Demolition Man extras to put a nature documentary extra-close to their eyeball. \nAs a showcase for what the Snapdragon 835 can do, though, it’s pretty interesting. It’s a testament to what the combination of small size, long battery life, and horsepower can pull off, even if the end result looks a little goofy. If it can do that much in a pair of sunglasses, though, just imagine what it can do for your next smartphone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:32:46.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
