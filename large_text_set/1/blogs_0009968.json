Bush, who also lost the popular vote, enjoyed a 61 percent approval rating in mid-January 2001. \nTrump has also lost non-partisan support, as his approval among independents has fallen from 46 percent to 33 percent over the past month. \nDespite the incoming president’s transition disapproval rating, the poll found that more than half of respondents rated Trump’s cabinet choices as “average” while 44 percent said the cabinet picks are “below average” or “poor.”   \n“Whatever the reasons, Trump’s approach since Nov. 8 has not softened Americans’ concerns about him, as a slight majority now disapprove of how he is handling the presidential transition,” Gallup stated. \n“Trump’s inauguration speech on Jan. 20 presents a major opportunity for the soon-to-be 45 th president to alter how Americans view him,” the company added. “But after that, his image will depend more on how his actions affect real-world outcomes including the economy, healthcare costs, taxes and national security.” \nAfter earning a surprise victory on Election Day, Trump enjoyed a boost in overall approval. But those ratings have fallen. \nAccording to a Nov. 22 Quinnipiac University poll, the president-elect enjoyed a 56 percent approval rating in regards to leadership skills. But in a Jan. 10 Quinnipiac poll, Trump’s approval rating had fallen to 49 percent.
