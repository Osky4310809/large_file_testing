The film sees Odenkirk play a down-on-his luck penner of smarmy odes to mothers, fathers, and all the other standard recipients of Hallmark’s industrially packaged warmth, whose life takes a turn for the surreal when the government announces a greeting card contest for a new holiday, and all the best entrants wind up dead. \nBesides the pleasure of Odenkirk as a deadpan, bumfight-loving former romantic, Girlfriend’s Day is stuffed with recognizable comedy names. Andy Richter, June Diane Raphael, Natasha Lyonne, Toby Huss, and even Odenkirk’s old Breaking Bad co-star Steven Michael Quezada all stop by to turn his hapless protagonist’s life into a saccharine-tinged hell. Girlfriend’s Day debuts (of course) on Valentine’s Day, February 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:32:45.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
