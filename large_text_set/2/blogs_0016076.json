Here’s what we learned: Crime rose about 7% from 2015; much of that was non-violent computer fraud and vandalism. In 2015 violent crime would decrease slightly,” Lemon would claim of the facts he had complied. He would continue: “Where did you get your information and did you get the official numbers?”\nHorowitz claims that his stats came from the Swedish Brå, an agency under the Ministry of Justice responsible for the reporting on crime trends in Sweden. He also claimed that he was speaking solely of “heavy crime — murder and sexual assault” in terms of those crimes that have seen a dramatic increase, while Lemon turns his argument to the fact that there doesn’t seem to be “a correlation between immigrants and a spike in crime.” He would go further to say that “there is no huge spike in crime there.”\nLemon would then point out that while crime fluctuated between 2006 and 2015 there was no “spike” to speak of. A tense conversation would then ensue where Lemon tried to explain how averages work, while Horowitz, not understanding, continued to argue that there was a spike in crime from 2006 to 2015.\nWatch the full interview above, via CNN.\n ", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fdon-lemon-calls-out-filmmaker-of-doc-on-sweden-over-questionable-stats%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Capture-13.jpg&description=Don%20Lemon%20Calls%20Out%20Filmmaker%20of%20Doc%20on%20Sweden%20Over%20Questionable%20Crime%20Stats", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fdon-lemon-calls-out-filmmaker-of-doc-on-sweden-over-questionable-stats%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light"], "published": "2017-02-21T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:27:34.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
