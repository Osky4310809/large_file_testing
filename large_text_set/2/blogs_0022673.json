Although Carlson’s representative have not offered a response, the report asserts that word has come from multiple sources involved with Carlson’s talks with the network, as well as her settlement with Fox News. \nBack in 2016, Carlson left Fox News and filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against former network chief Roger Ailes . Ailes was forced out over the scandal, and since then, Greta Van Susteren and Megyn Kelly both left their own positions at Fox and are now working for NBC. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:55:23.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
