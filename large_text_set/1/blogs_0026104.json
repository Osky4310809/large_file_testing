It only increases the number of unsafe abortions and it endangers the lives of women,” Bibeau said. \nCanada is joining a Dutch plan announced earlier in the week that is inviting pro-abortion countries to replace the $600 million in U.S. funding that will now be lost due to Trump’s decision. \n“Yes, we will support the [Dutch] effort,” Bibeau said. “Will it be directly through the fund or indirectly, this is not clear yet. But, I assured my colleague, the Minister from the Netherlands, that we will increase our funding to sexual and reproductive health and rights. This is definitely a very important priority for our government.” \nBibeau refused to put a dollar value on the funding increase and insisted upon describing abortion as an issue of “sexual and reproductive health” that is essential to the “empowerment” of women. \nTrudeau is a staunch supporter of Canada’s unrestricted abortion law and forbids any member of his Liberal Party caucus from espousing pro-life views. In order to seek election under the party banner candidates must sign a disclaimer that their position on abortion is “pro-choice.” \nNotwithstanding, Canadians remain divided over the issue of abortion, with a majority opposed to taxpayer funds being used for that purpose. \nFollow David on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T00:15:15.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
