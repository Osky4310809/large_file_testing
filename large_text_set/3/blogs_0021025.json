Getty The House of Lords is now the second biggest in the world \nThe House of Lords is now the second largest upper house in the world, only behind Japan, and many see it as being bloated and in need of reform. \nHowever, Prof Hazell indicated that as well as the Lords already underway in trying to reform itself he also indicated that in reality there was only so much they could do themselves. \nProf Hazell said: “The Lords are doing what they can and the new Speaker Lord Fowler is introducing reforms. \n“Lord Fowler is looking to bring in more voluntary redundancies. \n“Ultimately, there is not a lot they can do. Once you are given a peerage you are a peer for life.” Getty Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler \nLord Fowler, who was Secretary of State for Social Services for six years under Margaret Thatcher, said in September last year that the the House should be trimmed by at least 200 members. \nHe said in an interview with The House magazine: “I don’t think that we can justify a situation where you have over 800 peers at the same time as you're bringing down the Commons to 600 MPs. \n“The principle, it seems to me, is that we should have fewer Lords. We should certainly not have more peers than there are Members of Parliament. I think that's a principle that would probably find agreement amongst most of the House.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:16:30.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
