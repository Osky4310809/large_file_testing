Even though my tour is called the ‘Kathy Griffin’s Celebrity Run-Ins Tour,’ to support my book, I really want your readers to know that if you paid your hard-earned money for the book, you will [still] see all-new material when you will see me on Sunday, March 26 at the Benedum. Kathy Griffin \nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Sunday. \nTickets: $43.25; trustarts.org. \n“I’m a big believer in always switching up the material. Dammit, after 23 specials, I am nothing if not prolific.” \nMs. Griffin, who is in the Guinness Book of World Records for writing, producing and performing all those standup comedy specials, will be bringing her timely, sarcastic brand of humor. \n“I love to make every city as specific as possible,” said Ms. Griffin, who went on to “confess something that’s really dorky but in these times of political and emotional unrest, there is a video I go to at night. I’ll admit, I’m like the crazy person who, when they get particularly upsetting news, I will console myself with dog videos.” \nIn particular, she said, YouTube videos of canines wailing whenever they hear Pittsburgh’s Jackie Evancho sing. \nThe self-described “foul-mouthed” comedienne said she respects Evancho’s talent, but that has never stopped her from making fun of all “people, places and things” she finds hilarious. \nFor example…. \n“Even though the Delta Foundation is helping me put on this show, and I love and respect them, I kind of chuckled a bit when I saw ‘Penguins Host First LGBT Night.’ \n“I thought it was a night where the Penguins were going to play a game against a bunch of gay people, or only gay people would be in the audience, like Disney [theme parks] has ‘Gay Days,’ with only gay people and the women who love them. \n“Hint, hint: me.” \n“But then I looked it up online and saw it was the Penguins versus the Flames, which is think is deliberate. And then my heterosexual boyfriend — by the way, one of only about five heterosexual guys I know — said ‘No, it’s just a regular game and they they make a regular announcement that it’s LGBT night and they put the gay [rainbow] flag on the Penguins sign. \n“And I’m like, ‘well, it’s not that fabulous. It’s nice, but I wanted a bunch of gay guys, preferably Johnny Weir, to duke it out on ice.’” \nWhich led to Ms. Griffin spinning out yet another anecdote; the woman is, first and foremost, a storyteller. This one involved hanging out in a hotel with Mr. Weir, a former Olympic figure skater, reality show star and currently the most flamboyant sports color commentator in NBC history. \n“Just boas everywhere,” she said. \nA champion of the Pussy Hatted, Ms. Griffin also doesn’t mince words talking about the President, whom she has known for decades. \n“That day I spent where he hoodwinked me into one of his BS charity events at one of his dumb golf courses, where who knows where the real money went? Actually, I do know, because the Washington Post called me [for an expose on Donald J. Trump Foundation finances].” \nShe said she did the event as a favor to “Celebrity Apprentice” contestant Joan Rivers, Ms. Griffin’s close friend and mentor. Part of the fundraising was to benefit Ms. Rivers’ designated charity, “Gods Love We Deliver,” to those too sick to cook or shop for themselves, be it from HIV/AIDS or other illness. \nMs. Griffin said the “Celebrity Apprentice” producers asked her to make a $3,000 donation, and to write a check to the Trump organization. For various reasons — including Ms. Griffin only half-joking when she said she would rather accrue the credit card points — she balked at bypassing Ms. Rivers’ charity. \n“It was a bit of a battle with the producers,” she said. \nSuch stories (“the day Kathy spent with Liza Minnelli and Donald Trump, can’t get that at a Kevin Hart show”) are part of her storytelling standup. They are also the subject of her latest book, which was published last November. Tales of sitting next to Woody Allen at a dinner fall into the “some-of-them-are-just-crazy” category. \n“Woody Allen saying to me, ‘I’ve never missed an episode of ‘Hannah Montana’? And later saying ‘And now I have to watch my friend, Bill Cosby, getting railroaded’?” \n“I can’t put that in my act, because it’s not funny. But it is so [expletive] nuts. I had to put it in the book. This is not something he obviously said 30 years ago, so he doesn’t get that kind of a pass.” \nSpeaking as a 56-year-old woman who will perform more than 60 shows this year, Ms. Griffin said she knows she has to work all that much harder to succeed: “Hollywood can try to put me out to pasture but I am not saying ‘moo’ any time soon.” \n“Gloria Steinem told me it’s a feminist act every time I take the stage. I took it seriously, so that’s what I do. I work harder, jump higher.” \nOne of her favorite, and certainly most-watched, labors of love is the New Year’s Eve special with Anderson Cooper. What started as a guest appearance on CNN’s show from Times Square 10 years ago became a destination TV gig, one she helps produce now. \n“Anderson can’t just be perfect, not on my watch. Gay or not, he is my straight man… if I can make him collapse into tears of laughter, then I’ve done my job.” \nAlso doing her job involves getting at least one “good, solid walkout” from an audience member at her shows. Up until the time she takes the stage, Ms. Griffin is going through the news (real, not “fake,” she said) in order to brashly deliver her take on the day’s events. \n“Even two years ago, I could go out and do my tour and it was pretty much 100 percent pop culture. But now, I’m loving [current events], as a comic. \n“As a citizen and a woman, of course, I’m terrified.” \nMaria Sciullo: or @MariaSciulloPG.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:23:35.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
