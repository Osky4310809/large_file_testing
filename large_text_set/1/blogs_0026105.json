He is so aggressive even though he is not a tall, tall guy,\" the former Barcelona boss told a post-match news conference. \n\"It is the first game so it is not easy for him to communicate. He doesn't speak English so he will need time but he makes a lot of movements. \n\"The pass for the first goal is outstanding. We cannot forget that we played with three strikers who are 19, 21 and 22. \nGuardiola champions 'perfect' Toure \n\"They are so, so young. It is the future for Manchester City and all three they played really good.\" \nSane joined City from Schalke during the close season, like Sterling the year before and new recruit Jesus at considerable expense to refresh an aging squad. \nHis start to life in England was hindered by form and fitness problems but, having suffered a recurrence of hamstring pain on the back of his maiden City goal versus Arsenal in December, the Germany international has returned to Guardiola's starting line-up with two in two.
