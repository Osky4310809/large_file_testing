It currently services more than 40,000 customers a month.\nWith the funding, it plans to expand to other cities in Malaysia and increase its marketing efforts toward merchants to boost sales.\nNot a new model Delivereat faces still competition from other online food delivery providers like Foodpanda, which was recently sold to Delivery Hero. “This is not a new business model with some new age technology,” admits Victor Chua, Gobi’s vice president of investment in ASEAN.\nHowever, he said their decision to invest was driven by the team’s ability to execute their plans. “We definitely like how the team is running the business and we believe that Delivereat will continue to innovate with the vision to be profitable.”\nWith Gobi’s significant exposure in food ecommerce, “there’s a lot of knowledge and operational insight sharing that can happen,” Victor tells Tech in Asia . He adds that Gobi will be a pillar of support for Delivereat’s expansion into new areas.\nGobi has over 170 portfolio companies across China and Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, it has invested in wholesale food and beverage marketplace Supplybunny , restaurant discovery and booking startup Offpeak , beauty advisory platform Favful , and cosmetics and skincare marketplace Hermo , among others.\nThe VC firm’s US$14.5 million SuperSeed Fund targets seed-stage companies in Southeast Asia.\nThis post Delivereat secures funding from Gobi Partners to expand to new cities appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:07:27.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
