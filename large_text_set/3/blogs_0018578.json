O Alayebami, Mahmood Ahmadu (at large), and Drexel Tech Nigeria Limited, a firm that was awarded the recruitment job. \nMoro had, in his application filed by his lawyer, Paul Erokoro (SAN), sought the court’s permission to travel abroad for a medical appointment. \nBut in his ruling on Friday, Justice Nnamdi Dimgba, noted that it was too late in March to grant the application, dated December 16, 2016, seeking to meet an appointment scheduled for January 2017. \n“A medical appointment for January 2017 cannot be given in March,” the judge ruled. \nThe judge asked Erokoro to update the application, and adjourned until March 21, 2017 for hearing of pending applications. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T02:44:20.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
