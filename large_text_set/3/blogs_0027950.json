This is how I dance every time this song comes on. #ShapeOfYou #Blessings \nA post shared by Kandi Burruss (@kandi) on Mar 17, 2017 at 4:44pm PDT \n\nListen to the two songs and let us know if you hear the similarities.\n\n \n\n \nTake this money, make this money.\nVeronica Wells is the culture editor at MadameNoire.com.
