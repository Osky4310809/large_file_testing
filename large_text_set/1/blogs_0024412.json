And animals. \nAccording to Bored Panda , the whole thing started when Sarah Hill, a user from Virginia, challenged the VA Aquarium to top the Smithsonian National Zoo’s picture of a grey seal pup. We welcomed a gray seal pup Jan. 21. The pup appears to be nursing, moving & bonding well w/ mom. https://t.co/l0Bzu7g8ek #Squee pic.twitter.com/nEhuJe6vBk \n— National Zoo (@NationalZoo) January 25, 2017 \nBefore you could say “challenge accepted,” the Virginia Aquarium accepted Sarah’s challenge, and the game was on . \n— Queens Zoo (@thequeenszoo) January 25, 2017 \nThe tweets were hashtagged with both “#cuteanimaltweetoff” and “#challengeaccepted” and it wasn’t long before other zoos and aquariums joined the fun. When the Bronx Zoo entered the fray, they tagged a handful of other zoos, and soon it was an all-out cute animal melee! Among the facilities that participated were the Queens Zoo, the Tulsa Zoo, the Denver Zoo, the Columbus Zoo, and plenty more. \n— Queens Zoo (@thequeenszoo) January 25, 2017 Wait, everyone!
