Microsoft has developed Continuum for Windows 10 Mobile , and Ubuntu Linux has Convergence . Now Samsung is giving it a shot, with the S8's 'DeX' desktop environment. \nDeX works just like other solutions - just plug the S8 into the DeX dock, and connect a keyboard, mouse, and HDMI display. The phone then becomes a desktop computer, running Android apps in separate resizable windows. Any app compatible with either Android Nougat's multiwindow API or Samsung's old multiwindow solution should work. \nSamsung is hoping businesses will adopt DeX, with the company working with Microsoft and Adobe to make their apps fully compatible. I'm not really sure how many regular consumers will actually want it, but the dock will be available globally once the S8 is released. Press Release \nSEOUL, Korea – March 29, 2017 – Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. announced Samsung DeX, designed to improve productivity for mobile professionals while reducing the need to carry multiple computing devices.
