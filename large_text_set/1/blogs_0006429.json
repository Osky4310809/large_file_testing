Sleep Number just unveiled the bed of your dreams—or the dreams you would be having if only you could catch some sleep. Earlier this week at CES® 2017 in La Vegas, the company introduced its new 360 Smart Bed, which boasts features that will boost your overall sleep quality by supposedly putting an end to snoring for good , according to an official statement. \nIt’s basically the classic Sleep Number bed on steroids: As you toss and turn throughout the night, the smart bed will automatically adjust to your new sleeping position . If it detects you snoring, the base of the bed will actually raise your head up by 7 degrees to ease airflow and relieve common symptoms of snoring—a potential game changer, since snoring can lead to more complicated health problems later.
