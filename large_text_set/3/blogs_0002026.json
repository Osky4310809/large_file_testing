Who Is Noah in the Bible? \nIn a world taken over by evil, violence and corruption, Noah was a righteous man. However, Noah wasn't just a righteous man; he was the only follower of God left on the earth. The Bible says he was blameless among the people of his time. It also says he walked with God. \nLiving in a society saturated with sin and rebellion against God, Noah was the only man alive that pleased God . It's hard to imagine such unwavering faithfulness in the midst of total godlessness. Over and over again, in the account of Noah's life, we read, \"Noah did everything just as God commanded.\" His life of 950 years, exemplified obedience . \nDuring Noah's lifetime, the wickedness of man had covered the earth like a flood, so God decided to start over with Noah and his family. Giving very specific instructions, the Lord told Noah to build an ark in preparation for a catastrophic flood that would destroy every living thing on earth. \nYou can read a Bible story summary of Noah's Ark and the Flood here . The ark-building project took longer than the average lifespan today, yet Noah diligently accepted his calling and never wavered from it. Appropriately mentioned in the book of Hebrews \" Hall of Faith ,\" Noah was truly a hero of the Christian faith. Noah's Accomplishments \nWhen we meet Noah, we learn that he is the only follower of God remaining in his generation. After the flood, he becomes the second father of the human race. As an architectural engineer and shipbuilder, he put together an amazing structure, the likes of which had never before been built. \nWith the length of the project spanning 120 years, it was quite a notable achievement . Noah's greatest accomplishment was his faithful commitment to obey and walk with God all the days of his life. Noah's Strengths \nNoah was a righteous man. He was blameless among the people of his time. This does not mean Noah was perfect or sinless, but he loved God with his whole heart and was fully committed to obedience. Noah's life revealed qualities of patience and persistence, and his faithfulness to God did not depend on anyone else. His faith was singular and unshakable in an entirely faithless society. Noah's Weaknesses \nNoah had a weakness for wine. In Genesis 9, the Bible tells of Noah's only recorded sin. He became drunk and passed out in his tent, making himself an embarrassment to his sons. Life Lessons \nWe learn from Noah that it is possible to remain faithful and please God even in the midst of a corrupt and sinful generation. Surely it wasn't easy for Noah, but he found favor in God's eyes because of his remarkable obedience . \nGod blessed and saved Noah just as he will faithfully bless and protect those of us who follow and obey him today. Our call to obedience is not a short-term, one-time call. Like Noah , our obedience must be lived out over a lifetime of faithful commitment. Those who persevere will finish the race . \nThe story of Noah's drunken transgression reminds us that even the godliest people have weaknesses and can fall prey to temptation and sin. Our sins not only affect us, but they have a negative influence on those around us, especially our family members. Hometown \nThe Bible doesn't say how far from Eden Noah and his family had settled. It does say that after the flood, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat, located in present-day Turkey.
