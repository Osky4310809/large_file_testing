It takes a lot of time and dedication, especially if you are on your own, learning as you go, or a small team. You might feel like you’re spending the little time you have to work on your project trying to figure things out instead of making progress on the idea that inspired you to start in the first place. Did you know? Assets can help you learn by example. You can study the code that is automatically generated by the intuitive visual scripting and node-based interfaces in the Accelerator Pack assets to start to understand how scripts work and gradually become comfortable modifying, extending, and eventually writing code of your own. \nIf that sounds familiar, don’t worry, you are not alone. We hear this a lot from our community of aspiring creators that are big on ideas, but short on time. Artists want to focus on their craft and creating stunning visuals without having to battle the C# Kraken every step of the way. Programmers feel comfortable cranking out code, but they don’t necessarily want to spend their precious time building everything from scratch. Well, we’re dedicated to coming up with solutions that make your life easier and success more attainable. That’s why we created the Accelerator Pack, which we’re offering free for a limited time with Unity Plus subscriptions. \nIt includes 3 top-selling assets that can help you maximize the progress you make with your development time, get you closer to publishing, and save you a few headaches along the way. Playmaker The Asset Store’s most popular visual scripting tool. \nPlaymaker helps you unlock the power of Unity, even if you don’t know much about coding. You can quickly make gameplay prototypes, AI behaviors, interactive objects, cut-scenes, walkthroughs, and more. If you’re a programmer, Playmaker adds a powerful visual state machine editor to your toolbox and allows you to flex your coding muscle with Custom Actions, while significantly cutting down your development time with its rapid prototyping capabilities. “Thanks for saving me at least 6 months of learning how to code. There is nothing you can’t do with Playmaker. This is a lot more than a cookie cutter design tool, it’s like the equivalent of using Google Translate to instantly understand a foreign language.” — tal1m0n “From zero programming experience, I was able to understand some basic programming logic, and able to create games that generate revenue.” — th3z0d1ac “It will make you lazy in a good way because it makes regular coding feel like such a time consuming pain in the neck.” — Diabolical Software \nAmplify Shader Editor Intuitive shader creation and customization, even for the non-coder. \nAmplify Shader Editor gives you the power to create your own shaders without having to code them. It offers node-based, real-time shader creation in an intuitive interface that blends seamlessly with Unity’s UI. You’ll also get access to an extensive node library and growing sample collection, and full source code access. “Should be considered a standard tool for Unity developers… Thanks for removing another headache from my life as an indie game developer!“ — Robosaru “I bought this package with absolutely no experience of writing shaders whatsoever. Within a couple of hours of opening the package for the first time, I am staring at a shader, written by my own hand, that does EXACTLY what I want.” — SecretAnorak “As an artist, Amplify Shader Editor is a lifesaver. Even without a tutorial, I was able to create a simple shader in a matter of minutes.” — DavidHattori \nUltimate FPS A first person controller foundation that will save you hours… maybe even days. \nThis plug-and-play first person shooter platform is one of the longest-running and most popular tools on the Unity Asset Store. It can be used for any first-person experience — on PC, console, mobile, or VR. It’s known for smooth controls and fluid, realtime-generated camera and weapon motion and has been used in several famous and highly-acclaimed indie games including Rambo, Shark Attack Death Match 2, Time Rifters, and more. “There is no pre-made controller for Unity… that is more complete and requires less programming … It is a massive time saver.” — EvilGremlin “Amazing asset that will save anyone interested in making a quality first person experience in Unity several hundreds hours of code.” — tartiflette25 “Do you want to make an FPS with Unity? Do you want it to have the features players expect? Then you will need this.” — Maxwolf See it in action \nIn this video, Unity Technical Evangelist, Mike Geig, demonstrates how you can use the visual scripting, node-based shader creation, and first person controller foundation to bypass some of the coding work that might be slowing you down and slingshot your project closer to the finish line.
