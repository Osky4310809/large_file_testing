He can do it, because he’s a phenomenon. \n“Let’s be honest, we’re not up to the standard of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.” \nManolas is also generating plenty of speculation ahead of the summer window, with the Greek defender tipped to soon be heading out of the Italian capital. \nArsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have all been credited with holding an interest in taking him to the Premier League, but the 25-year-old insists any decision rests with Roma. \nLiverpool not looking at Manolas \nHe added: “My future is in Roma’s hands. If they want to keep me, they know what to do. If they want to sell me, then I can’t do anything about that. \n“It’s difficult to say we’re targeting the Scudetto, because Juventus are really strong and, as we’ve seen, they don’t drop points. \n“Our objective is to get into the Champions League and we’ve got a very important Coppa Italia semi-final against Lazio coming up. We can overturn that 2-0 first leg defeat, as we are the stronger side and we just have to prove it on the pitch.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:33:00.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
