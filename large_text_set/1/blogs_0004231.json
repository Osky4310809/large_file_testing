The two were headed to visit their father in hospice when Baker received a text explaining that he only had hours to live. \nShe stood up to console her sister, when she says a flight attendant got involved. “She said, you need to sit down and I said can I just sit here. I just want to console my sister. We just got word that our dad’s dying.” \nDespite Update To Disable Phone, Samsung Users Holding Tight To Note 7s \n“She said, you’re being very rude. My father is dying and I’m comforting her and they said she needs to keep her personal problems off the plane.” Hartman claimed. \nThe sisters tried to catch another flight the next day, but their father died before they could arrive. Now, they want the airline held accountable. Allegiant released the following statement: \n“We rely on our crew members to provide and oversee a safe environment for every passenger. We expect that authority to be exercised both judiciously and consistently…with empathy and with good judgement.” \nThe incident is now under investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T09:43:41.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
