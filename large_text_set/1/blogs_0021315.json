Chaka Fattah Set To Start 10-Year Prison Term January 24, 2017 11:58 AM Filed Under: Chaka Fattah Chaka Fattah. (credit: CBS 3) \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — A longtime Pennsylvania congressman convicted of racketeering is set to start a 10-year prison term. \nEx-U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah must surrender Wednesday at FCI-McKean in Lewis Run, in western Pennsylvania near the New York border. \nThe 60-year-old Philadelphia Democrat spent 20 years in Congress before his June conviction. \nThe jury found he took an illegal $1 million campaign loan, then used government and nonprofit funds to repay it. Four co-defendants were also convicted. \nFattah lost his bid to stay out of prison while he appeals. It’s unclear if he will be placed in FCI-McKean’s medium security prison or low-security camp. \nHis lawyers did not immediately return messages Tuesday. \nHis son, Chaka “Chip” Fattah Jr., is serving five years in an overlapping bank fraud case at a prison in Michigan. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
