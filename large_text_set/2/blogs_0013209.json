And so are endless matches; Hotline only allows three matches, to be exact, which is designed to foster more intimate communication between users. We haven’t tried it yet (it’s only available in New York for now), and it does cost $9 per month to use, so we’ll stay tuned to see if Hotline is a viable replacement for Tinder and Bumble users who are sick of the dating app hookup culture. For now, start working on that phone voice—because you know you haven't used that thing since at least 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:53:29.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
