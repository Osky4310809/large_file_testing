Well, there were rumours that the popular stand-up comedian has already been engaged to her boyfriend Harsh Limbachiyaa. But, back then, she kept on refuting all such reports and even got annoyed when she was asked about it. Now, according to a leading entertainment website, the two had their 'roka' ceremony and are now engaged to each other. Close friends from the industry present at the function were Krushna Abhishek, Kashmera Shah and Vipul D. Shah. The report also suggests that a party was also kept after the ceremony where the couple and the guests were in their dancing shoes and enjoyed the whole occasion. One more interesting thing that the report reveals is that the two are to tie the knot in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T08:48:20.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
