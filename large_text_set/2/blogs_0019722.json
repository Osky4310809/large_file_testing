Just a few months ago at the Latin Grammys in November the two even smooched on the lips onstage! \nThough we doubt the two will be getting back together anytime soon â€” following that smooch, Marc announced his divorce from his fourth wife, Venezuelan model Shannon De Lima . \nMaybe there's hope yet! \nThanks to Leah for posting this pic, by the way! Neither Jennifer nor Marc have posted anything to commemorate their children's birthdays!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:10:43.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
