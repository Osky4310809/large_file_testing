But the wheels of bureaucracy are turning slowly - and so is his search for a job. \nIt may never have opened many doors in India - and has raised eyebrows and grins elsewhere - but one thing was guaranteed: a name like Saddam Hussain was not likely to pass unnoticed. \nTwo years after graduating from Tamil Nadu's Noorul Islam University, the man from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand is feeling the strain. \nHe did well at college, and his classmates have already found jobs, but shipping companies turn him away. \n\"People are scared to hire me,\" Saddam-turned-Sajid is quoted by Hindustan Times as saying. \nHe says they fear complications from an encounter with immigration officials across international borders. \nSaddam thought he might easily get around this obstacle, by getting a new passport, driving licence and more. \nBut his job applications are still not proceeding smoothly as he cannot provide proof, under his new name, that he went to school - and this is proving to be a time-consuming exercise. \nAnother court hearing beckons on 5 May, this time to force authorities to change the name on his secondary school certificates, after which his graduation papers will need amending. \nSajid is not alone in his plight - but he may feel more aggrieved than the numerous Saddam Husseins of Iraq, who feel cursed with a name that was originally given in tribute to a leader whose legacy is one of a brutal dictator. Being Saddam in Iraq \nOne Saddam, a journalist working in Ramadi, a Sunni city in the desert province of Anbar, said his father was fired from his government job because he could not convince his superiors he was not a member of the dictator's Ba'ath party. \nHe had named his son Saddam, after all - what greater allegiance could he have shown to the ousted president, they argued. \nOthers had more terrifying stories - one said he was captured by a Shia militia, set down on his knees and had the barrel of a gun placed against the back of his head. Somehow, thanks to sheer luck, the weapon jammed, and the militia eventually released him. \nOne friend told me how, as a Kurdish schoolchild in Baghdad, he had known a fellow classmate named Saddam Hussein. \nWhile playing football with the boy, they would often shout at him: \"It is not only us who hate you, the entire country hates you.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T12:28:23.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
