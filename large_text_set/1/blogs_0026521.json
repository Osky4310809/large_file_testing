To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada \nâ€” Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017 \nSome wondered whether Trudeau's invitation was just talk. Last night's apparent terrorist attack on a Canadian mosque was just the sort of horror that President Trump had said his ban would protect against. \nBut Canada's government has made good on Trudeau's words â€” \"offering temporary residence to any traveler who is stranded in Canada as a result of a controversial and confusing travel ban,\" the Globe and Mail reports. [ Trump says â€˜all is going wellâ€™ on immigration order amid chaos ] \nAs noted in the paper's handy guide to Trump's executive order â€” \"Iâ€™ve been stranded. What can I do?\" â€” the offer won't do much good for people stuck in countries that aren't Canada, including those who arrived in the United States with U.S. visas, only to be detained and face deportation. \nBut some travelers were hit with the ban while en route from Canada to the United States, the Globe and Mail reported. They can now stay in the north â€” at least until Americans sort out the chaotically implemented order . [ Democrats will attempt to rescind Trumpâ€™s travel ban ] \nTrump's executive order, which was signed Friday, bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for three months, with longer restrictions on refugees. \nThe president said the bans would give his administration time to strengthen vetting procedures and keep \"radical Islamic terrorists\" out of the United States â€” though The Washington Post's Mark Berman reported that Trump's aides keep citing terrorist attacks that the ban would not have prevented, and others have accused Trump of trying to make good on his campaign promise to bar Muslims from the country. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ If anyone asks you what #Canada does with all its refugees, just tell them that we appoint them to the Cabinet. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ #WelcomeToCanada pic.twitter.com/bD4xzyKQBM \nâ€” Jonathan Menon (@JonathanMenon) January 29, 2017 \nCanadian officials also reported \"confusing and conflicting\" responses from the White House, according to the Globe and Mail. \nEven Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was unable to answer basic questions about the ban when his Canadian counterpart first asked him about it, the paper reported . \"The confusion left Canadian politicians questioning what steps to take next.\" \nFor some stranded travelers, there's now a solution: Live in Canada, for a while, if you want. \nâ€œCanadians are proud of our long history of acting with compassion and humanitarianism to those seeking refuge for themselves and their families,\" said immigration minister Ahmed Hussen â€” whom the Globe and Mail noted was born in one of the countries whose citizens are barred from the United States. \nMore reading:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:53:17.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
