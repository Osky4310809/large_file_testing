Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nThe first big iPhone and iPad update of 2017 has finally arrived. \nApple finally released iOS 10.3 to the public today after months of beta testing the new software. iOS 10.3 can be downloaded now as an over-the-air update, or installed via iTunes. iPhone and iPad owners can expect a rash of new features that not only make iPhone and iPad easier to use, but also more secure. \nHere’s everything that’s new: All the new features in iOS 10.3 Apple ID profile \nIn iOS 10.3, the Settings app gains a new profile section that lets you access you Apple ID profile information. The page shows all the Apple devices you’ve used to sign in. It also displays the iPhone owner’s contact info, security settings, iCloud, App Store settings, payment information and more. Find My AirPods \nKeeping track of Apple’s tiny AirPods is now as easy as pulling up the Find My iPhone app. AirPod owners can use the new tool to make the earbuds blast a loud sound so they can hunt them down. The feature only works from the last iPhone or iPad that was connected to the AirPods. (Here’s more on the new Find My AirPods feature .) iCloud calls for Verizon \niPhone subscribers on Verizon can now make and answer calls from any iCloud-connected device. Once enabled, Verizon customers can accept a call on their Macs, iPads, iPods or Apple Watches, even if their iPhone isn’t nearby. (The feature was already supported by AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint.) iCloud storage \nYou can now see how much iCloud storage you’re using by visiting the iCloud settings page. The new section gives users a graphical breakdown of how much storage is being used and by what type of files. Podcasts widget \nYou can now add a widget for Podcasts to your Spotlight search screen. CarPlay \nSome small changes were made to the CarPlay user interface. Three icons on the left side now show the most recently used apps. The Maps app also displays EV charging stations. Apple File System \niOS 10.3 switches iPhone and iPad users to the Apple File System, which provides stronger encryption and is optimized for NAND flash storage. (Find out more: Everything you need to know about the new Apple File System .) Transition animation changes \nApple made a very tiny tweak to the transition animation between apps. Apps now have more rounded edges when they open and close. Weather in Maps \niPhone owners with a 3D Touch device can hard-press on the new weather icon in the Maps app to view forecasts for a specific area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:10:52.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
