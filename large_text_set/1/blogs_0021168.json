Sarsour is Palestinian-American, from Brooklyn, and a Muslim woman who has stepped forward to demonstrate public leadership in a climate of escalating Islamophobic rhetoric . She’s a civil rights activist and the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. She has a track record as a well-respected community organizer. \nBut to Islamophobic trolls on Twitter, she’s an easy target. She’s been labeled a “Sharia promoter” and a “supporter of terrorism.” On Monday, as the scale of the marches across the country became clear, Sarsour bore some brunt of the backlash from angry abuse rolled out online: A #WomensMarch organized by a pro-Sharia woman is like a Million Chickens March led by Colonel Sanders. https://t.co/uA7tvzgolY \n— Larry Elder (@larryelder) January 22, 2017 MEET LINDA SARSOUR \nMember of terrorist organization #CAIR , SUPPORTS sharia… BUT meets with co-chair of #Womansmarch 2 protest oppression pic.twitter.com/7qhSmLWsId \n— Lori Hendry (@Lrihendry) January 23, 2017 #Womensmarch jew hater anti semite radical terrorist supporter Linda Sarsour leading \nBut Monday saw the hashtag #IMarchWithLinda emerge on Twitter, with women from across the country and across faiths sending messages of solidarity with Sarsour, recognizing her as a feminist leader and defending her right to be heard: #IMarchWithLinda because she is intersectional activism personified. \n— Phillipe Copeland (@DrAbolitionist) January 23, 2017 I stand unapologetically with @lsarsour because she is what Democracy looks like, and she is what Makes America Great. #IMarchwithLinda \n— eli ingraham (@eliingraham) January 23, 2017 #IMarchWithLinda because she fights for our Jewish community, all women & all people with fierce love.
