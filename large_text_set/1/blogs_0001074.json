Jones , USA TODAY Sports 10:43   Fan salutes Gary Kubiak (Photo: Isaiah J. Downing, USA TODAY Sports) \nDENVER – Gary Kubiak told his players Sunday night he would be stepping down from his job as Denver Broncos’ head coach, and now it’s official. \nThe team announced the move Monday morning. \n“This is an extremely difficult decision to step down as head coach. I love to work and I love football, but ultimately the demands of the job are no longer a good fit for me,” Kubiak said in a statement. \nKubiak and Broncos general manager John Elway will hold a joint news conference at noon ET. \nNowhere in the statement issued Monday morning did Kubiak mention retirement. Indeed, this is a resignation, with Kubiak’s future plans uncertain. NFL coaching buzz: Latest on job openings, candidates \nAll he knows for now is he believes he can’t physically and emotionally keep up with the grueling demands of head coaching. \nKubiak was briefly hospitalized in October and was forced to miss a game after falling ill. In 2013, while serving as head coach of the Houston Texans, he collapsed on the field after suffering a mini stroke. \n“I gave everything I had to this team the last two seasons, but this year, in particular, has been tough on me. As hard as it is to leave this position, I know that it’s the best thing for myself, my family and the Denver Broncos,” Kubiak said in the statement. \nKubiak went 24-11 in his two seasons with the Broncos and coached the team to a Super Bowl title last year. The Broncos beat the Raiders 24-6 on Sunday in Kubiak’s final game with the Broncos. \nFollow Lindsay H. Jones on Twitter @bylindsayhjones Facebook Posted!
