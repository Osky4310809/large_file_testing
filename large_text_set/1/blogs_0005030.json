(Facebook.com/NeilK) The flight from Australia to the United States is one of the longest in the world, and feels even longer in a middle seat.\nIt turned out drastically shorter for one passenger, whose profane complaints grounded his flight and led to his reported arrest after a few hours in the air.\nDescribed by authorities as a 42-year-old American, the man boarded a United Airlines flight on New Year’s Day — due in San Francisco more than 13 hours later, along with 251 other passengers.\nHe was seated between two of them, and didn’t like their cross conversation, other passengers told KRON 4 in San Francisco .\nNor could he find relief in a glass. “They wouldn’t let him have alcohol,” said KRON 4 reporter J.R. Stone.\n[ An unruly couple forced their flight to turn back. Police boarded, and passengers cheered. ]\nA passenger told the New Zealand Herald that the man “exploded into a fit of rage” after 40 minutes in the air. He cussed, demanded beer and tried to swipe a soda off the trolley cart, according to the news outlet.\nSomewhere over the Pacific Ocean, he took to his feet and voiced his ire — as a passenger recorded the scene.\n“If you see two last names the same, don’t put someone in the middle of them,” the man says, waving his hands at a flight attendant. She folds hers and asks for calm.\n“I’m as calm as can be!” the man says.\n“You’re yelling at me,” the attendant says.\n“Do you want me to [expletive] yell?”\n“Do you want me to call the captain?”\n“Do you know how cool it would be to have the airplane turned around because of me?” the man says.\n“You do that,” he dares, then calls the flight attendant fat as she walks away.\nThe plane diverted to Auckland, New Zealand, that evening. Another video shows police standing watch as the man collected his things and vacated his seat.\n[ Delta flight grounded after crew members get into fight with ‘flying fists’ ]\nA United Airlines spokesman didn’t provide any details about the passenger or his fate.\nThe New Zealand Herald reported that he was arrested at the airport, refused entry into the country, and was being held by police until he could fly home.\nSome of the other passengers, meanwhile, spent the late hours of New Year’s Day drinking in an airport bar.\nThe flight crew needed a rest before they could continue the journey, the airline explained.\nRead more:\nAmericans are cheap, Mexicans fly in style and other results from Expedia’s passenger survey\nBritish Airways flight grounded after ‘smelly poo in the toilet’ overwhelms passengers", "external_links": ["http://m.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11775772", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fneilmkay%2Fvideos%2F10108816815333270%2F&show_text=0&width=400", "https://twitter.com/aviselk", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/01-03-2017/t_1483455355494_name_20160103_angry.jpg", "http://kron4.com/2017/01/02/video-unruly-passenger-forces-plane-headed-to-sfo-from-australia-to-be-rerouted-to-new-zealand/"], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:43:13.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
