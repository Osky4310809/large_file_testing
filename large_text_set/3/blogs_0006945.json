He then jumped onto Hollywood Boulevard, driving along the Hollywood Walk of Fame as tourists lined the sidewalks with their phones out.\nWith traffic heavy and officers throwing spike strips out in front of the car, the suspect eventually came to a stop at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland. He surrendered and was taken into custody.\nThe exact circumstances that prompted the chase and the name of the suspect were not immediately confirmed.\nFor a closer look at the anatomy of a police pursuit in Los Angeles, check out this piece from CBS2 reporter Stu Mundel. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T06:50:24.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
