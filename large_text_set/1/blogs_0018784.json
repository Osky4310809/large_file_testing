Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWhen we last saw the nuns and nurses of Nonnatus House, it was at Christmas, when most of them had travelled to South Africa on a mercy mission to a struggling clinic. The new series of Call the Midwife picks up with their joyful return in the new year of 1962, a time of great social change – even in old-fashioned Poplar. \nBarbara (Charlotte Ritchie) has even more to celebrate, as she’s become engaged to Rev Tom (Jack Ashton), albeit with a ring he made out of grass. \nWhile they’ve been away, a new nun has been placed in charge. If Sister Ursula (guest star Harriet Walter) has a kind heart, she’s hiding it well. Her regime is one of strictness – she even tells off Sister Monica Joan for ‘gyrating’ in front of the TV. \nShe’s also changing the meals, doing away with hot lunches and putting a stop to the clinic’s friendly atmosphere: \"The biscuits are for fainters only,\" she decrees. \"Eating for two is about careful nutrition, not self indulgence.\" Meanwhile, poor Sister Julienne (Jenny Agutter) struggles with what looks like a demotion. Guest star Harriet Walter (Photo: BBC) \nThe first episode’s heartbreaking story is about Trudy (Pearl Appleby), who is heavily pregnant. Married to Lester (James Farrar), who has been released from prison, they already have a son, Micky, who has an eye problem and who is being bullied at school. Instead of being sympathetic, Lester is abusive. Trudy feels she has nobody to turn to, but no-nonsense Nurse Crane (Linda Bassett) takes the family under her wing. Look out for former EastEnder Lucy Speed as Trudy’s unsupportive mother.

Julienne clashes with Ursula about the best way to care for her. \nPatsy (Emerald Fennell) is reunited with Delia (Kate Lamb), but when she gets bad news from her family, she shuns her secret lover. Does this spell trouble for the couple? Nurses Barbara, Trixie and Patsy are back (Photo: BBC) \nThere is happier news for Shelagh (Laura Main). Fans will be able to guess what… \nThe ratings-winning drama, which has dealt with topics such as thalidomide, continues to focus on controversial plotlines, this time including a story about the horrific practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). \nCharlotte Ritchie revealed recently: \"There’s a Somali community in the East End, and one of our mothers has had FGM.\" She believes it’s a ‘brave’ subject for what’s often dismissed as cosy Sunday-night drama. \"It is a taboo issue and it’s not easy to write about.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T09:46:25.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
