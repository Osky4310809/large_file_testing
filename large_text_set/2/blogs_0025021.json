Freelancer photographer Norbert Juhász and his fiancée Dora, a writer, have joined the fray with a 16-year-old van they transformed into a solar-powered home on wheels, and they're driving it from Budapest to Morocco.\n\n\nWhile the exterior of the van is unremarkable, its interior packs all the amenities the couple needs on their journey. A multifunctional seat turns into a bed for two and includes a storage space and electrical system underneath. Opposite the bed is a small kitchen unit with a gas cooktop, gas cylinder, sink and a large water tank with a pressure-sensing pump. The tank is connected to an extra hook-up that leads to the rear of the van, where the water is used for quick showers. An L-shaped cabinet accommodates a refrigerator and more storage spaces, and features another section that doubles as a seating structure.\nRelated: How this photographer escaped the grid with her tiny Teardrop Trailer \n\n\nThe vehicle is powered by a 12-volt electrical system charged by either the 250-watt solar panels mounted on the roof, or the engine's generator. Excess energy can be stored in 200-Ah batteries attached to an inverter. \n\nThe couple spent around $7,200 for the van's transformation, including its custom-made furniture. They will travel through Southern Europe all the way to Morocco, and document their journey on the Rundabella website and Facebook page .\n+ Norbert Juhász \n+ Rundabella \nVia Treehugger \nPhotos by Norbert Juhász \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:01:53.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
