I have never seen them before.” \n“There’s rumors that they actually were right-wingers. They were a part of a kind of group that was organized and ready to create the kind of tumult and danger you saw that forced the police to cancel the event.\" \nCNN host Don Lemon seemed incredulous at Reich's claim that these protestors were actually right-wingers, questioning how this could be possible. Reich didn't really have an answer, and just said that he had \"heard\" things. \nBerkeley has nearly 40,000 students. I went to a school that had just under 4,000 students, and I spent half of senior week wondering who the heck half of these people were. \"I have never seen them before\" is not an excuse that Reich can possibly use to dismiss these rioters as outsiders. \nSecond, it'd be one thing if disrupting speakers wasn't standard operating procedure for the left. Trigglypuff was not a secret conservative. The people who threw the tantrum at the Ben Shapiro lectures aren't secret conservatives. They're leftists, straight-up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:01:35.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
