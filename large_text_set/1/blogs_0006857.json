Kits for both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Raspberry Pi-like devices will be offered from the company soon.\nThese updates come six months after AT&T announced its first starter kit, which included all of the equipment necessary for a plug-and-play setup, including anything developers might need to complete the project in one package.\nFor those using AWS, AT&T’s kit will come with an LTE Cat-1 modem, two antennas, USB cables, USB plug, both US and Mexico SIM cards with 300 MB of prepaid data for up to 6 months, an NXP K64F development board, and a microSD card. A product of the marriage of AT&T and Amazon produced by Avnet, this kit was put together by the same folks that gathered the first telecommunication starter kit.\nThe original kit actually included an Arduino microcontroller carrier board, which didn’t actually work with every developer, so AT&T retooled its focus to include the LTE IoT Add-on Kit. This kit will include a LTE Cat-1 modem, 300 MB of prepaid data for six months with a US and Mexico SIM card, two antennas, USB cables, and a USB plug with the option for a control board up to the developer. This should eliminate the issues that the original kit had to arise with it when it debuted.\nBoth starter kits will include support for PubNub’s Data Stream Network and APIs, so, either way, you decide to go as a developer you’ll be covered. AT&T wants to make it simpler for developers to get started with the creation of these kits, so it’s good to see the cooperation with brands taking precedence here.If this is something you’re interested in getting into, you’ll be able to get your hands on one as a dev in the coming months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T04:35:45.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
