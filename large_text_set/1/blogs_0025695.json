widespread agitation for resource control and better living standard in producing communities that suffer the brunt of heightening environmental challenges. \nThis, he said, had led to sustained armed struggle by militant organizations with host communities suffering the worst of it as oil facilities are systematically blown up causing severe oil spills that devastate the region’s rich agricultural lands and creeks. According to him, host communities also suffer heavy casualties in terms of precious life and property during encounter with security forces. \nHe said, “To address this painful anomaly successive Federal Government administrations rolled out ambitious palliative measures in quick succession such as the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, Oil Derivation Fund Commission, Ecological Fund, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, Presidential Amnesty Package, among others. \n“Despite these robust mitigation schemes established to cushion the harsh effects of stiffening environmental challenges in vulnerable host communities the problems persisted largely because the political class hijacked the scheme thereby shortchanging local communities that produce oil and gas and preventing them from due access to democratic deliverables.” \nHowever, Azogu maintained that OMPALAN believes that the issue of oil and gas requires a wider consultation of stakeholders across the country – bringing on board both the big and small producing states in order to nip the lingering crisis definitively in the bud and lay a solid foundation for lasting peace, equity and justice. \nHe said, “In order to restore sanity to the embattled Niger Delta region and provide a conducive investment climate for sustainable development goals OMPALAN is ramping up effort to mobilize the entire nation to present a common front to the challenges in the region.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T11:45:37.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
