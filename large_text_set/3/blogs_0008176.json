We have somebody who will sign legislation that we pass. We need to get into a governing mode and start thinking about actually achieving something rather than just kind of sparring,” he said. \nMcConnell said the legislation will never be perfect to all people. \n“I hope in the end that people will remember what Reagan said, that if he could get 80 percent of what he wanted, you call it a win and move on,” McConnell said. “And this bill is full of things that Republicans think are significant for the country. So what we’re arguing about is around the edges. And I hope, in the end, people will not say, ‘Because I don’t like this particular part, I’m going to take my bat and go home.’” \nMcConnell noted that only Republicans have been willing to take active roles in overhauling Obamacare, reforming the tax code and jobs \n“ We know (Democratic senators are) not going to participate,” he said. \n“I think it’s safe to say this has not been a kumbaya moment here at the beginning of this new administration,” McConnell remarked. \nMcConnell said Senate Democrats have been catering to protesters whose only goal is to stymie Trump. \n“They’re saying ‘OK, we’re going to take resistance out of the streets and right into the Senate and try to prevent the Trump administration from even functioning,’” he said. “It’s been a conscious effort, in my view, to not accept the results of the election by preventing the administration from functioning, which I think is really unprecedented. In other words, don’t accept what the American people decided.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:17:27.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
