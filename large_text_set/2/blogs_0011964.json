(@KFILE) February 16, 2017 \nAs for Ryan, she thanked Trump for answering her questions, and said that she's a \"journalist not a convener!\" I am a journalist not a convener! But thank you for answering my questions. https://t.co/fe9cGXG46w \nFor what it's worth, both the CBC and Cummings' office have denied that they are attempting to avoid meeting with Trump. \nCummings' office quickly disputed that characterization and said a fuller statement would be forthcoming. \nCummings told POLITICO last week that he intended to meet with Trump to discuss prescription drug prices. And he later told reporters he intended to raise the issue of voter suppression in minority communities. But the meeting was never officially scheduled. \nThe CBC was slightly more blunt: Hi, @realDonaldTrump . We’re the CBC. We sent you a letter on January 19, but you never wrote us back. Sad!
