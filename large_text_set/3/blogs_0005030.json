You can book the Sky Sports Box Office event here... \nHaye was asked to dismiss reports of an Achilles injuries when he attended Wednesday's media workout and Bellew urged his rival not to bring up any fitness problems after their heavyweight clash. \n\"It's here now and I'm looking forward to it,\" said Bellew. \"I don't really have much to say. It's been a long, hard camp. I've enjoyed it. David Haye said he is in the best shape of his life ahead of his fight with Tony Bellew this Saturday, which will be live on Sky Sports Box Office \n\"Nearly time to rock and roll. Let's see what happens. The main thing is no excuses. They have been put out to the media. We all get sore, we all get knocks and bumps. This is the combat business, it's called boxing. \n\"No excuses. I don't want to hear any of them at all.\" \nThe injury references by Bellew were brushed off by Haye, who believes he is an even more dangerous fighter after making his comeback from a shoulder injury. Both fighters shared a tense face-off in front of the cameras \n\"He said he wouldn't beat the old David Haye, but the new David Haye is better than the old one. Saturday night, you are seeing a real destructive job. \n\"Knocking him down for 10 seconds does nothing for me. \n\"He has made things personal. If he wants to do that, I'll make sure he never does that again. If he believes he can stop what I'm doing, he's in for a world of hurt.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T17:03:57.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
