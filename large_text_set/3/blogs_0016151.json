An amber alert was activated in Tennessee and Alabama following Thomas’ disappearance, and investigators were last able to locate her near Decatur, Ala.\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said they had received 450 tips, but no confirmed sightings, which makes investigators think he is purposely keeping Thomas out of the public eye.\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation added Cummins to its top ten most wanted list on March 17.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:15:17.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
