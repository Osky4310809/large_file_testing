This content is subject to copyright. AFP/Getty Images Christian Pulisic: Up ↑ \nSomehow, some how , this kid keeps surpassing expectations. He's already done things no American player has ever done in Europe, and against Honduras and Panama, Pulisic's star continued to rise. He was fantastic in the rout of Honduras with a goal and three assists. And against Panama, on a rough pitch, tough conditions, and a opponent determined to literally leave a mark on him, he still managed to be the most dangerous player on the field. No one's stock is higher right now. AP Jorge Villafana: Up ↑ \nThe USMNT's search for a left back might just be over. Jorge Villafaña stepped into the position against Honduras and looked like he'd been there for years. He wasn't fantastic against Panama, but he did his job. That's good enough at a position that has plagued the Americans for years. Mike Dinovo Mike DiNovo-USA TODAY Sports Graham Zusi: Up ↑ \nZusi continues to impress in his switch to right back. His ability on the ball makes him perfect as a marauding fullback, and he's constantly getting better on the defensive side of the ball. He's surely not the U.S.'s first choice at right back, but his performances there and versatility will definitely be something Bruce Arena keeps in mind and gives the U.S. depth at a position they have long lacked it.

A few months ago we didn't know if Deuce would be back on the pitch, but two World Cup qualifiers later and Dempsey showed exactly why he's one of the greatest player this country has ever produced. He scored a magnificent hat trick against Honduras, and popped up with the goal against Panama, ensuring the U.S. got the point they needed. This content is subject to copyright. AFP/Getty Images Jermaine Jones: Down ↓ \nJermaine Jones didn't play against Honduras, and he shouldn't have played against Panama. He was unfit and looked it, and looked completely off the pace. He was objectively awful and it was the type of performance that seriously brings up the question of the 35-year-old's future in the national team. This content is subject to copyright. AFP/Getty Images Tim Ream: Down ↓ \nTim Ream didn't play against Honduras, and he had a rocky outing against Panama. His game was erratic, making more than couple costly errors, but it was interspersed with some moments of pure defensive brilliance. On the whole though, he didn't quite look up to the level on the night and it's hard to see him more than being a deep depth option going forward. ©Icon Sportswire (A Division of XML Team Solutions) All Rights Reserved contact: info@iconsportswire.com http://iconsportswire.c Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Kellyn Acosta: Up ↑ \nThe 21-year -old Kellyn Acosta was brought on in the center of midfield at a crucial point in a match the U.S. needed a point from. That should tell you Acosta's stock is rising, and the versatile FC Dallas midfielder showed well in his 15 minutes against Panama. This won't be the last we hear of him. Frederick Breedon Getty Images Walker Zimmerman: Up ↑ \nEven though he didn't play a minute of the two qualifiers, Zimmerman's stock is up. It was big for him simply to be included in the squad, and with neither Omar Gonzalez nor Tim Ream covering themselves in glory in their showings, it's safe to say that that there's room for a young up and comer like Zimmerman to sneak in at centerback. 0Shares Which USMNT players saw their stock rise (or fall) in the last two World Cup qualifiers?
