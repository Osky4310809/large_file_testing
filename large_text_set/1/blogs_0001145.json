King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 3 Max Cavalera gave his former Sepultura bandmates a bit of a bash, essentially saying the \"jackasses\" haven't released a single noteworthy song since his departure back in 1996.Chatting with Metal Rules , Max first noted he tried to reach out to guys for a reunion, saying:\"We've been trying to do the reunion for a long time with the other jackasses. But they don't want to do it. They keep fucking it up. At one time I called Andreas [Kisser] - I said, 'Let's fucking do it, man.' I got so frustrated. I was just going nowhere with it. Because I want to do it for the fans. \"So thank god Gloria [Max's wife and manager] came up with ['Return to Roots' tour featuring Max and Igor Cavalera playing ' Roots ' in full]. She was saying, 'How about just you and Igor? Just do it yourselves - it's your record, you wrote it. Igor played drums on it. You wrote all the music on it. You sang all the stuff. I think people will like to see it just like this. They don't care about the rest.'\"Asked if he received any feedback from Sepultura about the ongoing tour, Max replied: \"I'm sure they are not happy. But no, I haven't heard anything from them. \"There's one thing I have to say about those guys: tell me one great song they have written since I left. Name one great album they have put out after that. \"I haven't seen anything. I don't know one name of one song as popular as ' Roots Bloody Roots .' So, it just tells me like whatever they are doing, I don't know how they keep on going. I don't think it's working at all. But somehow they keep on going, somehow. \"It's crazy to me. But we say, just fuck it. Because we got tired of asking them to do reunion and they never wanted to do it... Fuck it. I don't give a shit what they say. We're going to do this, and it's great. We don't care what they think or say. They can talk shit if they want to.\"During a separate chat with Loud Magazine , Andreas Kisser actually did comment on \"Return to Roots,\" saying he's against the whole concept of playing old albums in full on tour.The guitarist noted: \"It seems like a waste of time. It doesn't bring anything new to your career. Of course, we did play full albums for special occasions, like we played the whole ' Arise ' here in São Paulo for the anniversary of this metal club here in Sao Paulo. But it's a show or two, it's not like a tour.\"Of course, 'Roots' is an amazing album. 25 years later, we're so proud to be a part of such an amazing project.\"Directly asked to comment on \"Return to Roots,\" Andreas stated: \"I don't care. Everyone does whatever they want. If they feel that's good for their career, whatever, man. It doesn't change anything that I do. It's weird to comment on something like that, because, for me, it's weird. [Laughs] I don't see the point. \"They have so many different projects. Actually, they left Sepultura for those projects, and now they're playing Sepultura. I don't understand that kind of attitude. But whatever, man. I respect any type of opinion, and, of course, I don't agree with them all, but people are free to do whatever they want. You just have to live with the consequences - that's all.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:03:25.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
