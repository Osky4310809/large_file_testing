Sure, there were several Latin dance nights around town, but each specialized in a certain genre, which required much party-hopping in order to experience all the different types of music. \nFor example, El Floridita has always been a hot spot for salsa dancing in Hollywood, but it does not expand much beyond salsa and bachata. Plus, the club is popular with some highly talented salsa dancers who are fun to watch but make it intimidating for people with average salsa skills. \nAll these events were not multicultural enough for Lucero, either. Originally from Toronto, Lucero grew up in a diverse environment. Known as one of the world's most multicultural cities, Toronto's communities include Italian, Greek, Portuguese, and people from all corners of Latin America. \nAll of that is why, in 2012, Lucero started the first Sudamericana parties at the old Barcopa on Main Street in Santa Monica. She envisioned a night that celebrated all the music of Latin America, where Latin American transplants now living in L.A. can go to reminisce on the music from back home.
