Moto smartphone with 8GB storage gets FCC certification, could be the new Moto E By February 20, 2017 “Lenovo is planning to launch a new entry-level Moto series smartphone soon” \nIt appears that Lenovo is planning to launch a new Moto smartphone in the US soon. Ahead of the official launch, an upcoming Moto smartphone with model number XT1750 has received approval from Federal Communication Commission (FCC) in the US. The certification reveals that the phone will have 8GB of internal memory, which suggests it might be a new Moto E series smartphone. Motorola Moto XT1750 stopping by the FCC… 8GB internal mem, Dual SIM, 2350mAh battery. Codename “Watson” it seems. Moto E? Moto C? Moto..? pic.twitter.com/ocnQS5jvnN — Roland Quandt (@rquandt) February 16, 2017 \nAs per the gadget tipster Roland Quandt, the Moto XT1750 is codenamed ‘Watson’. The phone will come with dual-SIM slots and a 2,350mAh battery. It’s worth mentioning that the battery capacity is what’s confusing as the last-gen Moto E offering has a bigger 2,800mAh battery with a 5-inch HD display. The FCC certification hasn’t revealed the screen size of the new Moto smartphone. However, given the small battery capacity, it could sport a smaller form factor. \nLenovo launched the latest-gen Moto E series smartphones called the Moto E3 Power ( review ) in India in September last year. Priced at Rs 7,999, the E3 Power sports a beefy 3,500mAh battery, a 5-inch HD display, a 1GHz quad-core SoC, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 4G, VoLTE, 8MP/5MP cameras and Marshmallow.
