At the time, the House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz called her on-air pitch “clearly over the line” and “unacceptable.” Last week, however, in reply to a letter from the OGE, the White House said that Conway’s endorsement came “without nefarious motives.”\n“The White House’s response makes clear that disciplinary action will not be taken,” Shaub said in a separate letter addressed to Chaffetz and House Oversight Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings.\nBut Shaub expressed greater concern with the White House’s “extraordinary assertion” that employees of the President’s office are exempt from many ethics regulations. “The assertion is incorrect, and the letter cites no legal basis for it,” Shaub wrote to Passantino.\n“It is critical to the public’s faith in the integrity of government that White House employees be held to the same standard of ethical accountability as other executive branch employees,” he continued.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:07:40.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
