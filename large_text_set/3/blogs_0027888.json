Back in the early 1980s, the infamous Bhagalpur blindings had shocked and infuriated India. The 49-year-old freelancer’s gut-wrenching, low-budget documentary shows how the heinous offence continues even today, often as a form of vigilantism .\nQ: Can you put the issue of forced blindings in perspective?\nA: In the 1980s, some policemen of Bhagalpur district blinded 33 undertrials by injecting acid, termed gangajal by the cops then, into the eyes of the victims. It became international news. While the policemen in those parts never indulged in the practice again, common people have now adopted this cruel method of ‘crime control’ either to ‘punish’ petty criminals or settle personal scores in districts such as Bhagalpur, Supaul, Madhepura, Arariya and Purnea. Some cases have been reported from Sitamarhi, Nawada and Bhojpur.\nIn my documentary, I have primarily focused on the victims between 2012 and 2016. But there are several cases where the victims were blinded much earlier. In Sitamarhi district, a mob caught hold of a youth and allegedly poured acid into his eyes as revenge for an old enmity between a village chief and his predecessor in December 2003. The same year, Dhanvir Yadav’s eyes were gouged out with a sickle by a group of boys on the reported orders of a sarpanch of a nearby village in Khagariya district. In Nawada district, the eyes of three youths were gouged out by a mob for allegedly snatching a motorcycle in 2007. Then there’s the shocking case of Mohammad Shahid, a mason by profession, who was blinded 24 years ago in the left eye, and again in the right eye allegedly by the same bunch of villagers in Araria district. He is completely righteous now. The blindings continue unabated.\nAmitabh Parashar\nQ: Your documentary has been praised by Ian Jack in The Guardian. How did you get the idea to make it?\nA: During a trip to Forbesganj, a municipal town in north Bihar, in early 2013, I stayed in Aurahi Hingna, the famed Hindi writer Phanishwar Nath Renu’s village, and met the late writer’s family. I came to know of a case where two villagers had lost their eyesight after a mob injected acid into their eyes. The victims were Munna Thakur, who admitted later on camera to being a criminal in the past, and his friend Kanhaiya Thakur. I met Munna to hear his side of the story. When I started enquiring further, I was shocked to discover that there are many other such cases. Then I decided to tell their stories through a long documentary.\nQ: How many such cases have happened in Bihar over the past five years?\nA: In my documentary, there are 10 people on camera speaking about their plight. If we add up all the newspaper reports on such incidents, the number would be at least 30.\nQ: What kind of role do caste and class play in these incidents?\nA: In some cases, caste does play a role. For instance, Munna Thakur is a nai (barber) by caste. His alleged perpetrators are upper OBCs. He was blinded after his wife decided to contest the panchayat elections. But in many cases, caste has no role. The victims are mostly from marginalized section of society. They are invariably poor; some petty criminals. In some cases, people have been blinded for the flimsiest of reasons. A labourer alleged that he was blinded for just asking for his full wage. Raju Alam lost his eyes owing to an intra-community dispute. Ajay Yadav, a 24-year-old Madhepura farmer, met the same fate on November 15, 2015, allegedly for an ‘extra-marital affair’.\nMunna Thakur\nQ: What is the Bihar government doing about these incidents?\nA: In several cases, FIRs have been filed. But during my research and filming, I couldn’t find a single case where the victim had received any compensation. They are all struggling to get help from the authorities. A sincere lawyer, Ram Kumar Mishra, is fighting their cases. It is not that the authorities are unaware of such brutalities. But the administration hasn’t taken any concerted action to eradicate this inhuman practice. For the Bihar government, it is just another form of crime.\nQ: Who financed the film? How much did it cost and how long it did take to complete?\nA: It was tough for a freelance journalist like me to arrange money. I spent my savings because I was sure I wouldn’t get any money from any government agency for such a project. I started my research in early 2013 but the shooting started in late 2013. I got the CBFC certificate recently.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:55:29.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
