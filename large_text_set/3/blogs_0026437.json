WATCH: Unedited footage of Shiv Sena MP R Gaikwad roughing up Air India staff (NOTE: STRONG LANGUAGE) pic.twitter.com/idFr8MpUTo \nâ€” ANI (@ANI_news) March 23, 2017 \nAs the video shows Air India crew tried to restrain the MP and bring him to his senses. The Shiv Sena MP is seen here roughing up the Air India staff member after a small tiff. \nAn Air India spokesperson said two separate first information reports (FIRs) were lodged against Gaikwad, with one being for abusing and assaulting an AI staffer with slippers and \"attempting to throw him out of the aircraft\" -- in which he was prevented by other staff present. \nThe second FIR is for delaying a scheduled New Delhi-Goa flight with 115 passengers, owing to his behaviour on board. Both FIRs have been lodged with the Delhi Police. \nThe AI is also examining the possibility of creating a 'no fly' list of unruly passengers on the lines of other airlines, the spokesperson said. Representational image. PTI \nExplaining their version of the incident following an enquiry, AI said Gaikwad travelled from Pune to New Delhi by flight AI852, which landed in Delhi at 9.35 am. \nThe aircraft was later scheduled to fly to Goa at 10.55 am. \nAfter landing in New Delhi, all passengers disembarked, except Gaikwad. \nEnquiries revealed that the MP held an open business-class ticket, but wanted to travel on this flight that is a regular all-economy service and his aide was informed accordingly by the Pune Airport Manager. \nHowever, since Gaikwad insisted on taking that flight he was allotted a seat in the first row as there was no business-class configuration on it. \nAt New Delhi airport, the MP refused to step out for almost an hour, even as 115 Goa-bound passengers waited to board the flight. \n\"While the staff requested the MP to deboard, he became abusive and started hitting the AI employee with slippers. Gaikwad also tried to throw him out of the aircraft but was stopped by other AI staff,\" the spokesperson said. \nWhile the national carrier lodged the two FIRs against Gaikwad, the Shiv Sena has not reacted so far. \nWith inputs from IANS \n 52  52 pm Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:33:38.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
