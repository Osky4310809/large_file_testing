Peters says recent warm weather has affected the ice in small bodies of water, adding he’s not sure if there were warnings to stay off the canal in Airdrie.\n“The ponds and the canals in all these areas that take on drainage this time of year,they’re not going to be stable, they’re not going to be safe to be on. Hopefully we can get everyone to stay away from those.”\nPeters said it happened in the Bayside neighbourhood of Airdrie.\nIt’s awful, it’s pretty hard to talk about it\n“All the houses in that area back onto the canal system. It has a park around it and people recreate there.”\nMonday was Family Day in Alberta, a statutory holiday.\n“It’s awful, it’s pretty hard to talk about it,” Peters said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:31:15.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
