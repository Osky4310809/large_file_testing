Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nZlatan Ibrahimovic has left his arrival in England too late in his career for him ever to achieve ‘Premier League great’ status. \nBut the way he has established himself as a cult hero and the lightning rod for the resurgence of Manchester United will have left an impression on every football fan that will last long in the memory. \nI thought he’d play well for half the season, score a lot of goals and then fade. But he has proved me wrong. \nWhat has impressed me the most is the way he has adapted his game to the Premier League. \nWe’re not seeing the Zlatan from seven or eight years ago — the one who scored outrageous goals . Father Time has dictated we haven't seen the Ibrahimovic who did THIS... (Photo: ITV) ...to score from 30 yards with an overhead kick against England in 2012... (Photo: ITV) ...as a 35-year-old at Manchester United this season (Photo: ITV) Read More Seven reasons Man United fans now love Zlatan Ibrahimovic more than life itself \nHe hasn’t been the lazy, languid, pick-the-ball-up-20-yards-from-goal-and-go-past-people player he once was. \nInstead, he’s doing what his physicality and 35 years dictate: he’s holding the ball up, laying it off to the widemen, getting into the box and scoring headers and volleys from there. \nHe’s almost become a normal centre-forward — albeit a world-class one — and that just shows the skill-set he has. The versatile Swede has instead been playing like a 'regular' striker.... (Photo: AFP) ...albeit a very, very good one — as his late headed goal on Sunday...

When he went to Juventus, Inter Milan and then Barcelona, he showed his technical ability and physicality as well. \nThat just shows what he can tap into. \nIn England, he realised people were going to stop him, were going to close him down, if he tried to run with the ball. \nSo he hasn’t really done that. \nHe has said, ‘You know what? I’m going to go back to being a big, 6ft 5in centre-forward — hold it up, lay it off, get in the box. I’m good in the air, good at getting in front of people.’ Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T21:31:40.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
