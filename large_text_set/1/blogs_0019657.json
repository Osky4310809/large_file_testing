The researchers discovered the mice had significantly less Th17 after eating a diet that involved way less chewing. \nTo confirm their findings, the scientists then rubbed the oral cavities of the mice with a cotton applicator, to induce damage similar to chewing. Afterwards, the amount of Th17 cells increased. (here’s why the sound of chewing drives you crazy .) \nThe researchers believe that this shows chewing food may help ward off sickness, by triggering a protective immune response in our gums. \nBut it’s important to note that a flood of Th17 cells is not always a good thing, the researchers say: Too much Th17 has been implicated in periodontitis , or gum disease. What’s more, the physical effects of chewing can also make the effects of periodontal bone loss worse. \nStill, the researchers believe the findings could eventually lead to new ways to treat other inflammatory conditions, according to MNT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:40:03.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
