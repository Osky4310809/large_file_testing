The team also placed first at the Connecticut State Girls’ Scholastic Chess Championships this past January. \n“For these young girls, it’s a tremendous confidence boost. It’s being part of a community, it’s learning how to be in a competitive environment, yet still be in a very supportive environment,” Mafosky said. \n“And it’s not like they’re just good for girl players — they’re some of the best players in the entire school.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:05:12.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
