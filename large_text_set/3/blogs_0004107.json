Huh? I thought, is this cute blue and purple bottle really for my hair, or is it one of those cleverly disguised skincare/makeup products? Even for someone who always keeps an Amazonian Clay 12 Hour Blush and Shape Tape Contour Concealer handy in my makeup bag, I can honestly say this caught me totally off-guard. \nNonetheless, I clicked on the brightly packaged bottle, and it was true. Tarte has just launched a new dry shampoo. Mind. Blown. While the brand dabbled into hair-care before with their Tarte Cosmetics Amazonian Clay Volumizing Brow & Hair Powder, this is a much different product we're hoping will become a hero product. Staying true to their mission, the formula is completely vegan. The dry shampoo uses rice bran wax to help lengthen and volumize strands, rice starch to help absorb oils, and cellulose to help add texture. But, what's really interesting about this product is that it is inspired by the brand's top-selling mascaras. If you've used any of Tarte's mascara's you know that these formulas really focus on the rootsâ€”lifting and adding volume to your lashes, which is also the same idea with this product. Not only will it remove any unwanted grease, but it will also add body to your hair with a bit of hold, too. \nMore from the world of Tarte:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:12:43.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
