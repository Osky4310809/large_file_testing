That’s the way I felt. I put my hands up,\" he said of the moment with the scoreline so tensely tied at 1-1. \n\"To not hit the target… it was a chance I should have hit the target with, and probably should have scored. I apologised for not hitting the target but the lads were fine. It’s one of those things, isn’t it? They happen sometimes.\" The England star failed to get a decent contact on his effort (Photo: Laurence Griffiths) The chance cost Liverpool victory (Photo: AFP) \nLallana produced a lung-busting run from midfield to get clear in the box on the end of a brilliant move he started, but after fine work from Giorginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino gave a him sitter from barely six yards, he fluffed his lines. \nIt was a miss that instantly became an internet trend, and he revealed that it left him totally devastated. \n\"Oh, I’m absolutely gutted. It could have proven to be the winner and it was a big moment in the game. I’m so disappointed with it,\" Lallana said. \n\"My eyes lit up, I just thought to myself if I get some connection on this, it’s a goal. It just took bounce in front of me, I might have just taken my eyes off the ball for a second and got excited. \n\"I’m only disappointed not to score it because it could have been the difference. It was a great game to play in and I’m sure it was a great game for the neutral to watch. \n\"Two top teams playing football like that. These are the games you want to be involved in. We were dangerous and looked as if we would get the second. I felt if we got the second, we would have put the game to bed.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:04:46.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
