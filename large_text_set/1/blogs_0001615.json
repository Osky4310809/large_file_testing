Sam Bradford and his record-breaking season is proof of that. \nSunday in the fourth quarter, after the Vikings had thoroughly thrashed the Chicago Bears and built a 38-10 lead, Bradford exited the game, finishing 25-of-33 for 250 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. \nWhile Bradford's stats were impressive, it was the 25 completions on 33 attempts that put the seventh-year quarterback in the record books for the highest single-season completion percentage in NFL history at an astounding 71.6 percent. \n\"Obviously, it's nice. It's pretty cool,\" Bradford said post-game about his new NFL record. \"I would trade [the record] for wins any day, but the fact that we were able to go out there and accomplish that as a group. You know, everyone contributes to that and it's pretty cool.\" \nNew Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees previously held the record when he completed 71.2 percent of his passes in the 2011 season but was unseated from the top spot on Sunday by Bradford. \nIt was overall a solid season for Bradford who wrapped up the season throwing for 3,877 yards, 20 touchdowns to just five interceptions and a passer rating of 99.3, sixth-best in the league. \nBradford had been criticized all season for not throwing enough deep passes and settling for short, underneath receivers that gain small bits of yardage at a time and surely that played a huge role in Bradford attaining such a milestone. However, a record is a record and Bradford earned this record \nThird-year receiver Adam Thielen became one of Bradford's favorite targets throughout the course of the season and was happy that he was able to contribute to such success for his quarterback. \n\"Yeah it's cool,\" Thielen said after the game. \"Obviously it's nice to have him here. He's a great quarterback and just a great guy to have in the locker room. He made it easy on us receivers, which was nice obviously.\" \nMinnesota's season may have come to a close on Sunday, but Bradford's record will remain at least until next season and likely even beyond that.
