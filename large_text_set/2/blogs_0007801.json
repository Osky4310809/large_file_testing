Forbes \nTHURSDAY 7 FEBRUARY 2008 - Police officers surround the shooting scene outside Kirkwood City Hall Thursday at the corner of Madison and Kirkwood Road on Feb. 7, 2008. Photo by J.B. Forbes \nEditor's note: This originally was published on Feb. 8, 2008, the morning after the deadly rampage in Kirkwood. \nAn armed man stormed into City Hall Thursday night and opened fire at a City Council meeting, killing five people and injuring two others before he was shot and killed by police. \nAmong those killed were Councilwoman Connie Karr, two police officers and two others at the meeting. \nThe rampage began in a parking lot outside City Hall, where the gunman shot and killed a Kirkwood police officer, according to St. Louis County Police spokeswoman Tracy Panus. \nThe gunman then entered City Hall and opened fire. A correspondent for the Post-Dispatch who was attending said the 7 p.m. meeting had just started - the mayor was opening the meeting just after the Pledge of Allegiance - when the man rushed into the council chambers yelling and began shooting with at least one weapon. She identified the man as Charles Lee \"Cookie\" Thornton, a man she knows from covering the council. \n\"He came from the back of the room, \" said Janet McNichols, the correspondent. \"He kept yelling something about, 'Shoot the mayor' and he just walked around shooting anybody he could.\" \nMcNichols said the shooter first fired at Tom Ballman, a police officer at the meeting. She said she looked up to see the officer had been shot in the head. \nThornton then targeted Public Works Director Kenneth Yost, who was sitting in front of McNichols. He was also hit in the head, she said. \n\"After that, I was on my stomach under the chairs, \" she said. \"I laid on my stomach waiting to get shot. Oh, God, it was a horror.\" \nMcNichols said Thornton continued to yell about the mayor, and from his voice and the gunshots, she could tell he had approached the dais at the front of the room, where the council sits behind a semicircular desk. \nHe fired at City Attorney John Hessel, who told McNichols he fended the attacker off by throwing chairs. She saw Hessel later and said he appeared uninjured except for a knot on his head. \nAmong those hit, in addition to Ballman and Yost, were Mayor Mike Swoboda, and council members Michael H.T. Lynch and Karr, McNichols said. \nThen police officers burst into the room and there was more yelling, McNichols said. First, Thornton saying he had a gun, she said. Then gunshots and the officers saying they'd got him. \nPanus later confirmed that police had killed the man believed to be the shooter. \n\"We have what we believe to be our suspect, \" Panus said. \"We are not currently actively searching for anyone in the area.\" \nMcNichols said about 30 people were in the council chambers at the time of the shooting. Witnesses were herded into offices while police secured the scene. Later they were taken to the police station to be interviewed. \nThornton was not a stranger to the council. He was often a contentious presence. \nMcNichols said he often aimed his ire at the mayor and at Yost. \nLate last month, a federal judge in St. Louis dismissed a lawsuit in which Thornton, representing himself, claimed Kirkwood officials violated his free speech rights by prohibiting him from speaking out at meetings. \nIn a ruling Jan. 28, U.S. District Judge Catherine D. Perry took into account that Thornton had twice been convicted of disorderly conduct for disrupting meetings in 2006 with off-point complaints about persecution by officials. \n\"He came to many, many meetings and always said terrible things to the mayor, \" McNichols said. \"He'd come to the meeting and he'd have a big easel and a picture of a donkey on there and call the council asses.\" \nSportscaster Doug Vaughn of Channel 4 said he went to Kirkwood High School with Thornton and has run into him through the years. He said Thornton's behavior changed after police cracked down on his parking of vehicles for his construction company outside his home in Meacham Park. He felt harassed, Vaughn said. \n\"He was more than a critic, \" Vaughn said. \"It got to where he was showing up at every council meeting and trying to dominate everything. He kind of lost his mind.\" \nFamily members of Thornton said Thursday night that they had no idea that he was contemplating anything violent. They said they were stunned after learning about the shootings from news reports. \nGerald Thornton said his brother's last words were, -\"'To God be the glory' and that he loved us.\" \nThey didn't know he was headed to the council meeting, they said. \nCity Hall is at 139 Kirkwood Road, with the police department just to the west across a parking lot. Three blocks surrounding it were quickly cordoned off as dozens of police cars, firetrucks and ambulances from other districts, including Normandy, Eureka and Des Peres, poured in to help. \nAn hour after the shootings, ambulances and fire rescue vehicles were still arriving at the scene. \nMedia were kept about three blocks from the scene. \nDotti Durban and her husband, Mike, had planned to attend the City Council meeting to learn about an idea to rezone an area near Manchester and Kirkwood roads but she got held up at work. She was met by dozens of police cars as she drove to city hall in hopes of catching part of the meeting. \n\"Lucky for us that we weren't at that meeting, \" Durban said. \nDonna Poe, executive director of the Downtown Kirkwood special business district, had been at a special work session about parking downtown with the city council. She left about 6:40. \nShe went home and relatives called to tell her about the shootings, so she came back. She was waiting late in the evening with others near city hall watching the scene. \n\"I'm very upset, \" she said. \nAbout a block away from city hall is a monument to another recent violent incident in Kirkwood. It honors Sgt. Bill McEntee, who was gunned down in the city's Meacham Park neighborhood by Kevin Johnson in 2005. Johnson was convicted late last year and sentenced to death earlier this month. \n\"It's just mind boggling to see all this happening again, \" said John DeSherlia, who lives nearby. \"I mean this is like deja vu. You don't think these things will happen in Kirkwood. We've built ourselves up as such a safe community.\" \nThe shooting spree Thursday night was reminiscent of the day in 1992 when Kenneth Baumruk, a litigant in a divorce case, pulled put a pistol in the St. Louis County Courthouse in Clayton, killed his wife and wounded four others. He survived and has been sentenced to death for the slaying. \nLeah Thorsen, Doug Moore, Stephen Deere, Ken Leiser, Steve Giegerich and Todd Frankel, all of the Post-Dispatch, contributed to this report.
