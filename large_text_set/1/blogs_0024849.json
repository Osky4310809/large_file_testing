Justice Azmat Saeed Sheikh, a member of the bench, said the violence took place \"right under the nose of Punjab Police and there was total inaction.\" \nThe court also said at the time that police at the \"highest level\" may have been told not to take action when the violence erupted. \nThe accused in the blasphemy case, identified as 26-year-old Sawan Masih, and the complainant, his Muslim friend identified as Imran Shahid, had quarreled under the influence of liquor, but the latter claimed it was a case of insulting the Prophet Muhammad. \n\"Both Imran and Sawan are close friends and the former has made the allegation only to settle a personal score because they had quarreled over some petty matter,\" a local resident, Dilawar Masih, who lost his house and shop in the attack, was quoted as saying at the time. He added that the attackers burned their houses even after the accused had been arrested. \nBlasphemy is punishable by life in prison or even death in Pakistan. \nThe blasphemy law, embedded in Sections 295 and 298 of the Pakistan Penal Code, is frequently misused to target religious minorities â Christians, Shi'as, Ahmadiyyas and Hindus â and allows Islamists and others to justify killings. Extremist Islamists believe that killing a \"blasphemous\" person earns a heavenly reward. \nJust an accusation under the controversial law is enough to have a person arrested, and there is no provision to punish a false accuser or a false witness of blasphemy. Some local Muslims seek revenge by making an allegation against his or her adversary who is a non-Muslim. Many who are accused of blasphemy are also often killed by mobs extra-judicially.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:51:53.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
