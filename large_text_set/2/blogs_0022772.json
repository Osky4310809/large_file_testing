So Akshay Kumar is playing the evil Doctor Richard in Shankar’s magnum opus that stars Rajinikanth as the protagonist. Remember the scary pic of Akshay looking like a crow? Well, yes. That’s his look for the movie. Anyway, the actor has left for Chennai to complete the film. We found out about the same through S Shankar’s fanclub on Twitter. The active page has been sending out updates of the film’s next step on their page for quite a while now. Slated to release this year, it also stars Amy Jackson as Professor Vasu’s bae. As this is Akshay’s South debut, fans are super ecstatic! Also, the film will be released in about six languages including Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, English, Japanese and Chinese! 2.0, which is Asia’s costliest film, also stars Sudhanshu Pandey, who will be seen as Dr Bora’s son, and Adil Hussain. \nEver since it has been reported that Akshay will make his South debut in Shankar’s film, fans have gone berserk. After working on several remakes of South films, looks like Kumar decided to go a step further and enter the untouched terrain of movies down South. Although Akshay’s fandom isn’t very strong in the South states, the way promotions of the film have started, it might give him an upperhand. On several occasions, Rajinikanth himself stated that the antagonist’s role is more powerful and impacting in this sequel to the 2010 blockbuster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:07:00.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
