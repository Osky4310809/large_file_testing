A pet to love and cherish not to abuse. read petition letter â–¾ \nAnyone can own a pet. The increasing abuse suffered by these pets is at an alarming rate right across the world. We need a register in Australia so that you can see if that person is on the register so that if you are a breeder or just have to give your pet up due to extenuating circumstances. You can be reassured that the person and/or family they are going to will provide a home that is safe and free from abuse.Now that animal abuse is being taken far more seriously than ever before, more and more jurisdictions are altering their laws to reflect this new reality. A number of United States jurisdictions have now made laws that require the names of animal abusers to be displayed in a registry that is similar to the ones that are used for sex offenders.These registries are designed with the objective of keeping people who have harmed animals in the past from ever having the chance to do so again and they are a welcome addition to the law-making policies of places as disparate as New York City and Tampa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:56:31.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
