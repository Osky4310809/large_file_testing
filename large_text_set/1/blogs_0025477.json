The boxer mentioned that he is on good terms with his family despite being hurt by the disagreements. \nAs per the publication, the boxer said that he intends to have “a family relationship with them rather than a business relationship. They'll be at my next fight, hopefully. I will invite them.” \nIn the ongoing dispute between his wife Faryal Makhdoom – a model – and his parents, Shah Khan claimed that Faryal lied about abuse and mistreatment, and said that she was neither a good wife nor a decent mother. \nDuring this time, Shah Khan also stated that the boxer will soon divorce Faryal, something that the couple denied completely in their interviews to media. \nTwo weeks back, Amir Khan found himself at the centre of controversy again after an alleged inappropriate video clip surfaced on the Internet. In response, the boxer and his wife Faryal explained that they suspected ‘someone close to them’ was behind the leak, doing so simply ‘out of revenge’. \nDuring a TV appearance, the couple reiterated that divorce is still not even a remote possibility, according to a Daily Mail report. \n0 0 Boxer Amir Khan drops dad, uncle from management team following feud was posted in sports   Amir Faryal, Amir Khan Boxing, Amir Khan Family Dispute, Amir Khan Faryal Makhdoom, Boxer Amir Khan, Faryal Makhdoom Allegations, Amir Khan, Boxer Amir Khan, Faryal Makhdoom, Saj Mohamed, Saj Mohammed, Shah Khan, Tahir Khan, Taz Khan.   \"Boxer Amir Khan drops dad, uncle from management team following feud\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/129370-Boxer-Amir-Khan-ditches-family-best-man-to-keep-business-separate .
