And young people are even more tired of it — 71 percent of those between ages 18-34 say Trump should close his Twitter account.\nSEE ALSO: The Trumpster Fire is the Yule log that 2016 deserves\nIt's worth noting just 899 voters nationwide were polled between Jan. 5-9. But even Republicans weren't exactly lining up to defend Trump's love of Twitter; just 49 percent said he should keep his account. And the Republicans polled were pretty much the only ones who kind of supported Trump keeping his Twitter account.\n\"Voters in every other party, gender, age and racial group say close the account,\" the poll reports.\nTrump has used Twitter to showcase the vague outline of his policy ideas and beliefs, but perhaps more notably, to come down on anyone who says anything about him that's not exactly glowing — from the rant about Meryl Streep in which he called her \"overrated\" to that time he tried to set the cast of Hamilton straight after they appealed to Vice President-elect Mike Pence (again using his apparent go-to insult for entertainers).\nThe cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016\nIt's not the first time voters have said they don't like all the Trump tweets, as another Quinnipiac University poll back in late November reported that 59 percent of Americans wanted him to delete his account.\nThat's the feeling of a lot of people, from Hillary Clinton to some of the #MAGA voters that put Trump in office, a reality shown by a little Tumblr page called Trumgrets.\nDelete your account. https://t.co/Oa92sncRQY\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 9, 2016", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aK2bKnuXQg4mlM098adiW_5_ppQ=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F343977%2F3098c291-b4fc-42ba-95ac-ee497d9bff0a.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/K0_OhCIWWR-8Z8aTT5ckJ-fs1ow=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F343977%2F3098c291-b4fc-42ba-95ac-ee497d9bff0a.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xrxd1dLi7jFn8jYYdV9KEyjmfg0=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F343979%2Fcb51f299-9b22-4f87-9ce8-62d12c07758c.png", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/800298286204723200", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IBgA63AZLfPPN_7MW81AOEiMbEw=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F343979%2Fcb51f299-9b22-4f87-9ce8-62d12c07758c.png", "https://t.co/Oa92sncRQY", "https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/740973710593654784", "https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2405", "https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2415"], "published": "2017-01-11T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:22:37.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
