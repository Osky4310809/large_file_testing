About 28 percent wanted it repealed immediately even if there is no plan in place, and 11 percent had no opinion. \nThe poll results come as the GOP-controlled Senate votes on a budget resolution this week that will kickstart the repeal process. Republicans aim to repeal the healthcare law but leave it intact for a few years while a GOP replacement is created and approved. \nHowever, the delay has caused consternation from several GOP senators. More than five have announced doubts with the plan and are worried about uncertainty in insurance markets. \n  \nThe poll did find that a majority wanted the law to be either repealed in part (32 percent) or completely (27 percent). Another 24 percent want it expanded and 11 percent want it left alone. \nA majority of Americans also want to keep several parts of Obamacare. \nFor instance, 55 percent want to keep the employer mandate, which requires businesses with more than 50 employees to offer health insurance. Another 27 percent want it repealed and 17 percent didn't know or had an opinion. \nThe poll was of 1,988 registered voters with a margin of error of 2 percentage points.
