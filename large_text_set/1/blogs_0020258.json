Could   \nThe 'Kate effect' is running out if the latest sensational claims are to be believed – that the Duchess of Cambridge isn't welcome at the upcoming Baftas. \nThe organisation has confirmed that an invitation both to its president, Prince William and his wife, have been given despite claims that senior staff are allegedly concerned that mother-of-two Kate would upstage the star-studded guests expected to attend. \nA Bafta spokesperson told The Sun: “It is completely untrue that Bafta has suggested that our president attend on his own. We would be delighted to welcome Their Royal Highnesses any year they are able to attend.” \nIts statement comes amid the newspaper's claims that several sources had claimed that they want Prince William to come along without his wife for fear of the 35-year-old 'stealing the spotlight'. \nIt would be the first time ever that anyone didn't want the Duchess to bring her 'Kate effect' on an event. \n“William has faced serious criticism from the film industry for missing the Baftas the last two years, despite being our president.
