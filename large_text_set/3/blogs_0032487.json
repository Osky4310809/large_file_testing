They have not been given due process,” the Waterville Area Humane Society wrote in a letter to District Attorney Maeghan Maloney. “The new owners were not aware of the more recent court case, nor the date for it, and therefore were not involved with the proceedings.”\nDakota didn’t display any aggression toward dogs or people while housed at the shelter.\nAnother court hearing over its fate is scheduled for Friday.\nView this document on Scribd \nView this document on Scribd \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:24:21.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
