Save REUTERS FILE PHOTO / Reuters \nA day after a WikiLeaks post claimed to reveal inside details of the CIA's hacking apparatus , the agency has responded with a \"no comment\" and then some. In a statement posted by NBC News , the folks at Langley said: \"We have no comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents released by WikiLeaks or on the status of any investigation into the source of the documents.\" \nSimple, right? But it didn't stop there, as the agency went on to defend why (theoretically, of course) it might keep a catalog of exploitable vulnerabilities in smartphones, TVs and other devices without warning their manufacturers. The CIA confirmed its mission to \"aggressively\" collect foreign intelligence as the first line of American defense, highlighted that it's legally prohibited from operating inside the US and said the American people should be \"deeply troubled\" by any attempt to damage the Intelligence Community.
