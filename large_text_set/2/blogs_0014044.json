For example, while a scene in a movie does correctly show that *NSYNC once surprised a teenage Spears with a serenade on her birthday, Lance noted that it happened onstage, not in a room.\nBut Spears and Timberlake’s big breakup scene — in which Nathan Keyes’ Timberlake accuses Natasha Bassett’s Spears of fooling around with choreographer Wade Robson — was completely a product of producers’ imaginations.\n“It just didn’t happen,” Bass explained. “It’s fun to think [that it] happened — just like the Justin-Britney dance off — but it didn’t happen, guys.”\n…Damn. There goes everything we thought we knew about the early-aughts.\n\nBass added that he realizes how fun it is for all of us to speculate about potentially super dramatic things that happened back then, and seemed genuinely apologetic about being the bearer of lame news. But on the bright side, he did reveal that he and the *NSYNC dudes have a text message group chat.\n“We talk daily,” Bass said. “All five of us…All we do is bag on each other all day long.”\nWhich apparently means there’s no bad blood between the rest of the guys and Timberlake, even though he dragged them without mercy in his Hollywood Reporter profile last week for literally no reason at all, saying he “felt like I cared more about the music than some of the other people in the group.”\n“I don’t think it’s true,” Bass concluded. “Obviously we cared about the music. But I understand where he’s coming from, for sure. Because at the height of *NSYNC, it was crazy. You’re getting pulled in so many directions, and you do feel like you’re not in control anymore.”\nYou’re a class act, Bass.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:21:48.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
