He appeared to be practicing his speech. \n\"Trump sure looks like he's practicing his speech here,\" Axios tweeted.\nThe video clip got the social media treatment, with several Twitter users providing their own commentary as to what President Trump might have been doing in the limo. The Daily Show went as far as to adding the audio from Trump's infamous hot mic moment with Billy Bush where he bragged about grabbing women \"by the p*ssy\" over the video clip.\n\"BREAKING: Hot mic catches Trump rehearsing speech. #JointSession,\" the Daily Show tweeted.\n\nOther Twitter users provided alternative theories as to what President Trump was up to before his big speech.\n\"Trump looks like he's trying to cram moments before an exam,\" wrote one Twitter user.\n\"Trump practices talking about his 'crowd size' in limo ride to #JointSession,\" wrote another.\n\"Trump is practicing his speech 'I do not like them Sam I Am, I do not like green eggs and ham!' #JointAddress,\" tweeted another user.\nOther Twitter users were more critical of Trump's actual speech.\n\"Trump wants 'streets where mothers are safe from fear.' Reminder: A man who bragged abt assaulting women is President. #JointSession,\" NARAL tweeted. \"Trump: 'My job is to represent the USA' Unless you are a woman, Latinx, an immigrant, Muslim, #LGBTQ... #JointSession #TrumpTranslator.\"\nAnother key moment during President Trump's address to congress included his recognition of the widow of Navy Seal Ryan Owens, who was killed during the Yemen raid.\n\"Ryan died as he lived -- a warrior and a hero,\" Trump said during his speech. The crowd then stood and applauded the veteran's wife for about two whole minutes. Trump then told her that \"Ryan is looking down and he's very happy cause he just broke a record.\"\nWhile the tribute touched some people, others were not so moved.\n\"Disgusting. Ryan didn't want to break a record,\" one social media user tweeted. \"He probably wanted to live no thanks to this sloppy mission. Trump's fault. #Jointsession.\"\nOthers felt President Trump did a fine job.\n\"Trump has exceeded my expectations with this speech,\" wrote one user. \"Bravo.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:50:53.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
