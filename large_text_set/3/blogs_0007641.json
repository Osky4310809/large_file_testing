The cheapest new MacBook Pro , the one with just two USB-C ports and no Touch Bar, starts at $1,499.\nThere is now a way to get it cheaper, as Apple started adding that particular variant of the 2016 MacBook Pro, to its online store of refurbished products.\nSEE ALSO: Why the new MacBook Pro's battery life is great for some, not so for others\nUnfortunately, at the time of this writing all the refurbished new MacBook Pros are sold out; there's only a couple of models from 2015 for sale. But the fact that Apple started adding laptops from 2016 to its refurbished store probably means there will be more such deals in the future.\nMacRumors grabbed a few screenshots before these laptops were sold out; the discounts varied from 12 to 16 percent, which isn't amazing but is in line with Apple's usual prices for refurbished laptops.\nApple tests its refurbished products and sells them with a 1-year warranty. As the company puts it, the supplies are limited, but the page is updated frequently.\nWATCH: Turn your laptop into a touchscreen with this ingenious magnetic bar", "external_links": ["https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/08/2016-macbook-pro-refurbished-store/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/jxHP9OsY.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/jxHP9OsY.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-09T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T17:51:06.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
