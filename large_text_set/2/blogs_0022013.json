Five-a-day: what counts towards it? \nL ead author Dr Dagfinn Aune, from the School of Public Health at Imperial, said: \"We wanted to investigate how much fruit and vegetables you need to eat to gain the maximum protection against disease, and premature death. \n\"Our results suggest that although five portions of fruit and vegetables is good, 10 a day is even better. \"Fruit and vegetables have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and to boost the health of our blood vessels and immune system. \n\"This may be due to the complex network of nutrients they hold. For instance they contain many antioxidants, which may reduce DNA damage, and lead to a reduction in cancer risk. \n\"It is clear from this work that a high intake of fruit and vegetables holds tremendous health benefits, and we should try to increase their intake in our diet.\" Whilst consuming more than five portions of fruit and vegetables a day may be desirable, two thirds of adults currently don't consume the recommended minimum of 5-A-Day Dr Alison Tedstone \nT he study, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, also found that smaller intakes had benefits; a daily intake of two-and-a-half portions was associated with a 16 per cent reduced risk of heart disease, a 4 per cent lower risk of cancer and a 15 per cent reduction in the risk of premature death. \nMeanwhile, a separate story published in the journal Thorax, found that a fruit and veg-rich diet is linked to much lower risk of chronic lung disease. \nExperts assessed information on the health and dietary intakes of more than 44,000 men from Sweden. During a follow-up, almost 2,000 cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were diagnosed. \nThe authors found that those eating five or more daily servings were 35 per cent less likely to develop lung disease than those eating two or fewer daily servings. \nEach additional serving was associated with a 4 per cent lower risk of COPD in former smokers and an 8 per cent lower risk in current smokers. \nThe British Thoracic Society stressed that people who smoke should know that kicking the habit is the most effective way of reducing their chances of developing COPD. \nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: \"The 5-A-Day target is the foundation of a healthy balanced diet and is an achievable way to help prevent a number of diseases. \n\"Whilst consuming more than five portions of fruit and vegetables a day may be desirable, two thirds of adults currently don't consume the recommended minimum of 5-A-Day. \n\"Adding pressure to consume more fruit and vegetables creates an unrealistic expectation.\" Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:59:37.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
