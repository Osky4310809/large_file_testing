Like so many others who are saddled with skin disruptions they didn't ask for, the two conditions took a toll on Mitchell's confidence, filling her with shame. Now the 23-year-old Las Vegas-native has created a YouTube channel, both for those who love makeup artistry—and for those who suffer from similar skin conditions. The idea is that serious conditions are more prevalent than one might think, and nobody should have to deal alone. Growing up, Mitchell rarely (or never) saw anyone with either conditions in magazines or on TV. (Think about it: Have you?) Well, that's not entirely true. Mitchell saw those suffering from acne or hyperpigmentation touted on television only in commercials—when somebody was trying to sell her something to make it all go away. The pressure Mitchell faced from her peers and the media to\"correct\" her skin deflated her self-esteem, especially as her conditions only seemed to worsen. \"As I grew older my skin became more sensitive, and I would automatically scar no matter what I did. The scars would take months to go away or they wouldn't go away at all,\" Hendrix told Allure . Eventually, the cycle drove Mitchell to extreme measures. \"I tried starving myself for two weeks, eating nothing but yogurt once a day, because I was told that if I lost weight my acne would go away,\" she says. \"It's frustrating when people judge me and assume that I can simply wash this condition off with a product. It's not that easy.\" You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:35:28.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
