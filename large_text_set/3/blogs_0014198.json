Part of that was earned, as Jackson made coaching hires based on previous knowledge of the system that helped him win 11 titles, but it also feels like a lazy go-to for story ideas about a team that’ll miss the playoffs for a fourth consecutive season. \nEven when considering this, when the head coach comments on it, it becomes a newsworthy item. \nJeff Hornacek was asked about the offense in the context of free agency, and told reporters that he believes it would be a bonus, and not a deterrent, for certain types of players. “There might be players that think [the triangle offense is a deterrent], but there are also probably players out there that say ‘Oh man, I’d like to run something like that,'” Hornacek said Wednesday, via ESPN . “There are guys that may not necessarily like to run around and in [screen] staggers and all that stuff. It’s still an offense where guys, if they’re knowledgeable about the game, should like.” \nWhen run correctly and consistently, the triangle offense provides an equal opportunity for everyone on the floor to be in a position to take open shots. Role players and shooters in the corners can benefit greatly from it, while other systems may end up leaving them more lost. \nBut there’s a fairly big learning curve where this particular offense is concerned, and it requires having the right roster construction for it to work without a hitch. We’ll see if the Knicks are able to make the right kind of offseason moves so that Jackson’s vision can finally be realized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T05:11:58.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
