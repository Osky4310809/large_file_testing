PM @theresa_may concedes to MPs, allowing the @HouseofCommons a vote on any proposed #Brexit deal. https://t.co/fF0CKbxNGN — RT UK (@RTUKnews) February 7, 2017 \nHowever the vote was canceled abruptly at a meeting on Tuesday, after the council leadership changed its mind and instead approved a 4.99 percent increase. \nCorbyn suggested the government gave Surrey Council a special deal because Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Chancellor Philip Hammond both represent constituencies in the county. \nSurrey is one of the richest counties in the UK and represented solely by Tory MPs. \n“ My question was whether there’d been a special deal done for Surrey – the leader said they’d had many conversations with the government, ” Corbyn pressed May in the House of Commons.
