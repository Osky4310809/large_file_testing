The Red Devils beat Rostov 1-0 at Old Trafford on Thursday to advance to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Europa League. It was their third match in eight days and 18th so far in 2017 due to their involvement in the Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and EFL Cup. Paul Pogba and Daley Blind both went off injured against Rostov, and Mourinho hit out at fixture scheduling after the match, per BT Sport (h/t Goal ): \nIt's difficult to play Monday with 10 men, it's difficult to play now, it's difficult to play 12 oâ€™clock on Sunday. We have a lot of enemies. \nA lot of people might say we should have scored more goals. But a lot of things are going against us. The boys are amazing boys. We will probably lose the game on Sunday. Fatigue has a price. \nI will remember forever when I spoke to the UEFA delegate in Rostov. He told me if any of our players gets injured, the insurance paid. Whoever decided the Monday and Sunday games probably thinks the same way. Jake Humphrey @mrjakehumphrey 3/16/2017, 10:37:00 PM As well as Pogba and Blind likely being absent to take on Boro at the Riverside Stadium, Ander Herrera and Zlatan Ibrahimovic will both miss the fixture due to suspensions. United have not lost a league game since October, and Middlesbrough have dropped into the relegation zone after a run of 10 games on the bounce in the English top flight without a win, but clearly Mourinho does not feel form will matter that much. Boro sacked manager Aitor Karanka on Thursday, so assistant head coach Steve Agnew will take charge for the visit of United.
