One person in the group, Eric Sinton, watched from across the platform as a 47-year-old Medford man wandered dangerously close to edge.

The man, who later admitted to being under the influence, badly hurt his ankle and couldn’t get up. \nEric, who’s now home on spring break in New York, recalled for WBZ that split second decision to jump in after him. \n“The train had just come and dropped off a bunch of people,” Sinton said. “I knew I had a few minutes. I had some confidence jumping in.” Group rescues man who fell on tracks at Davis Square Station (Image from MBTA) \n“I wasn’t really thinking a whole lot,” Sinton said. “One moment he fell in and then I was down there with him.” \nThe MBTA does encourage people to contact police or MBTA staff if someone is on the tracks, because of the electrified third rail. \nEric said he could not have helped the man without his friends. As Transit Police arrived to take the victim to the hospital, Sinton says he gave them a “thank you fist bump.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:37:27.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
