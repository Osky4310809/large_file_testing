Davis/Getty Images\nThe American Health Care Act, the GOP bill to repeal and replace Obamacare , is expected to be voted on by the full House of Representatives later this week.\nHealth policy experts have been digesting what the law could change for average Americans, including the AHCA's impact on the cost of health insurance.\nAs part of the AHCA, Americans who do not get coverage through their employer or a government program like Medicaid or Medicare will receive a tax credit to go out and buy insurance through the individual insurance market.\nThe AHCA does not adjust subsidies based on income or cost of living, unlike the Affordable Care Act, instead giving a flat total to people based on their age.\nWalletHub looked at the ACA and AHCA tax credit structures and determined the metro areas where the average tax credit for insurance would fall the most.\nThe cities are clustered in a few states. For instance, of the 17 metro areas that would see the average credit decline by $3,500 or more, 7 of them are in North Carolina — the most of any state.\nOnly two of the top 17 cities are in states that voted for Hillary Clinton, with the other 15 cities in states that went for Trump in November.\nWe've got the top 17 via WalletHub, check them out below:\nView As: One Page Slides 17.
