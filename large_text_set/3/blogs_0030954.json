KL Rahul laid the base for the win with a finely-crafted fifty while Ajinkya Rahane, in his first Test as captain, gave India a finishing touch that they would've have wanted with a brutal 28-ball 37, completing a fine turnaround after their crushing loss in Pune in the first Test. \nAs a result, India won the series 2-1, regaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and ending the season as the top-ranked Test team in the world in a season that ended with 12 wins, four draws and a solitary defeat - an amazing phase that they will look back with immense pride. \nIndia had put in a splendid bowling effort on the third day to dismiss Australia for 137. Needing 106 to complete a series victory, Murali Vijay and Rahul held on to their wickets for more than 30 minues. Runs didn't really flow during a tough initial phase, but India made decent progress with Rahul looking to press on. \nAustralia needed a barrage of wickets and quickly if they were to put India under pressure. Pat Cummins gave them an opening when he had Vijay feather an edge behind while on 8. Vijay should have been dismissed in Cummins's previous over, his first of the day, but the Australians didn't choose to review a caught behind appeal that had gone off the gloves. \nIn the next over from Cummins, Vijay's defence took the edge through to the keeper and the umpire made the right decision. Cheteshwar Pujara's knock lasted just five deliveries, ending in a comical run-out after a huge mix up. Glenn Maxwell hit the stumps direct from covers and India suddenly found themselves two down. \nThe captain, Rahane came out looking to score quick and put the pressure back on Australia. He opened his account with a solid straight drive for four, and followed that up with an equally impressive pull off Cummins. After the drinks break, Rahane stepped into Twenty20 mode. He slammed a brutal pull over midwicket for six, and then followed it up by stepping away from the stumps and whacking another one over covers. Any hopes the Australians had of a miraculous comeback when up in smoke with those shots. \nRahul gave India their victory and brought up his sixth fifty of the series with a flick for three off Steve O'Keefe and let out a huge roar, while Rahane calmly went up to the Australians to shake hands. \nIndia will look back at the series with tremendous pride. For the first time this season, they found themselves playing catch up, and they responded in style. They did not really find themselves in the dominant scenarios that had come to define them, but yet, chasing the eight ball, they showed they are still close to impossible to beat. \nFor Australia, they will go back with their head held high. They were expected to have their socks knocked off, but competed in every single game and took the contest until the end. They had their chances in the final game too, but couldn't find the killer instinct to put India to the sword. A fascinating series, full of controversy and outstanding cricket comes to an end. Perhaps, this is one during which cricket was truly the winner. \nBrief scores: Australia 300 & 137 (Glenn Maxwell 45; Ravindra Jadeja 3-24, Umesh Yadav 3-29, R Ashwin 3-29) lost to India 332 & 106/2 (KL Rahul 51*) by eight wickets. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T09:03:42.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
