The players are the medicine for the Spain team and they will help us achieve our goals.\" \nSpain take on Israel on Friday in World Cup qualifying looking for a win that will keep them above Italy and at the top of Group G. \nBut with Israel just a point behind the top two in third place, Lopetegui is well aware of the threat they pose. \n\"The main focus is to get points against Israel. We need to convey the importance of this game,\" he said. \n\"They have good players and they are a competitive team. We know how difficult they are, we have to perform well. \n\"We absolutely respect Israel and I'm sure that they are also going to be respected by the city of Gijon.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:01:31.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
