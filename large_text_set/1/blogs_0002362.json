The planning application can be viewed/commented on here:-http://planning.sholland.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=H23-1295-16&from=planningSearch [Reference H23-1295-16]It is highly likely that this breeding facility will be used to supply rabbits for medical research.Rabbits are frequently used because they are mild-tempered and easy to handle. In addition to the suffering caused by experiments, the laboratory environment itself is also particularly noxious to rabbits, causing great stress, weakening their immune systems, and making them more prone to illness.The British Union Against ­Vivisection said rabbits are forced to endure cruelty in research that often poorly mimics human diseases. BUAV’s chief executive, Michelle Thew, said: “It is unacceptable that many thousands of rabbits continue to be used in UK laboratories each year. We ask that people stop and consider the plight of these sweet animals who continue to suffer and die in experiments.”Eyelids ripped & bones broken - Britain's horror testing on 12,000 rabbits in ONE YEARhttp://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/577401/Britain-cruel-animal-testing-rabbits-Eyelids-ripped-bones-brokenWe the undersigned ask South Holland District Council to refuse the application for the proposed rabbit breeding unit in Crowland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T04:00:31.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
