(and here you thought having to wait an extra few months for Game of Thrones season 7 is going to be hard). But what if you’re curious about the series but never got around to watching it the first time around, or maybe weren’t even born yet? Don’t worry, because Showtime has got you covered. \nStarting on Sunday, February 5th at 7 p.m. ET, Showtime will start replaying the entire series every Sunday night, with two episodes per night, starting with Lynch’s extra-long pilot, followed by the first regular length episode. This schedule will continue for all 30 episodes of the series, as well as the prequel film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me . All of this will dovetail perfectly into the May 21 premiere of the long-awaited third season of the show. (And for those of you watching the show for the first time, may I recommend our handy-dandy Twin Peaks: Revisited recap series). \nTo promote the classic episodes’ return, Showtime has put together a little trailer celebrating the original series–specifically, celebrating one of the few things everyone in the town of Twin Peaks has in common: a deep love of rich, black coffee. And no one on the series loved coffee more than FBI Agent Dale Cooper, played by Kyle MacLachlan . You can now watch the new “Damn Good Coffee” supercut trailer for the original series above . If that doesn’t put you in the mood for a cup a’ joe and a Twin Peak s marathon, well…maybe the eventual “cherry pie and donuts” supercut teaser will do the trick. \nThe classic episodes of Twin Peaks return on Sunday, February 5th at 7p.m ET. The new series debuts on Sunday, May 21 at 9 p.m., ET. \nAre you planning on giving the classic series a rewatch on Showtime before the new season debuts? Let us know down below in the comments!
