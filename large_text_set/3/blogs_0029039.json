I'm happy when he makes a goal, or gives an assist. \n\"Suarez also, he will be the best player in the world. I think it's the best moment of my career, not in numbers, but in football, I hope to keep this average by helping my team-mates.\" \nThe forward's talent in the final third has led many, including three-time World Cup winner Pele, to tip him as the eventual successor to Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the world's best player. \nBut Neymar insists that he will not be drawn on comparisons, and that he is a big fan of both stars. \n\"This is something that I do not feel comfortable talking about, I do not like it,\" he admitted. \n\"They are two great players, players who have been maintaining a gigantic level for 10 years. I admire these guys. \n\"One I have at my side every day (Messi). I just want to be better every day, to get better every day, not to be better than anyone else. \" \nBrazil and Neymar triumphed 4-1 over Uruguay on Thursday, and can seal World Cup qualification this week with four games to spare should they beat Paraguay and Ecuador and Chile fail to win their fixtures.
