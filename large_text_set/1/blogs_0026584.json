As part of the transition, it will stop all sales of its first (and only) phone, the Robin , along with accessories. It will, however, commit to honoring warranties for the next six months, and releasing security updates until February 2018.\n\nThe short blog post on Nextbit's community page outlines the move pretty succinctly:\nNextbit will operate as an independent division inside Razer, focused on unique mobile design and experiences. To put it simply, we'll be doing exactly what we've been doing all along, only bigger and better.\nRazer is known primarily for its lineup of gaming accessories, but more recently for its move into audacious and popular laptops.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:17:20.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
