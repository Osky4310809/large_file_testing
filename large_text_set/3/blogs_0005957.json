Gary Gray’s directorial debut in the franchise is packed with over-the-top action — serious fire power, burning rubber, a humongous wrecking ball, tanks, gorgeous Lamborghinis, snowmobiles, fighter jets, some awesome stunts (like cars doing somersaults) and, yes, even a submarine are all part of the action. \n“The Fate of the Furious” hits theaters on April 14. \nCheck out the trailer above to see just how rogue Dom goes. 'Fate of the Furious': 8 Craziest Moments From First Trailer (Photos) \nWe finally got our first look at the eighth movie in the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise , dubbed \"The Fate of the Furious.\" And the trailer was quite a doozie -- it showed us Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) turning on his family, as well as a parade of increasingly insane stunts and set pieces. So insane that street racing in Cuba seems positively mundane. Let's take a look. Universal \nThe trailer opens with our heroes driving through a concrete wall and through a bombed-out town -- and apparently that's Roman's (Tyrese Gibson) fault. The carnage continues when Tej (Ludacris) summons a wrecking ball to wipe out a convoy of bad guys in spectacular fashion. Universal \n\"The Fate of the Furious\" is all about Dom's betrayal -- the team isn't going to let it slide. So they chase him down, and attempt to trap him by firing cables from five cars into his. But Dom easily does some kind of shenanigans to smash the other cars. In the process he kinda punches his own door off. Universal \n\"The Fate of the Furious\" will take the family to these icy wastes for a big chase that gets interrupted by, uh, a submarine. No, really, this movie is going to have a car chase that involves a submarine. Universal \n\"Fate of the Furious\" seems filled with stunts involving car doors, as we see Roman use his, from a cool orange Lambo, as a shield from gunfire before whacking his snowmobile-riding attacker with it. Super good. Universal \nThe good guys find themselves overmatched as they try to take down Dom, so they seek help from an unlikely place: Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), who killed Han. To procure his help, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has to go into the prison where Deckard is being held and start a riot. Hahahaha. Universal \nWe still don't know the exact deal with Dom turning his back on family, but this kicker at the end of the trailer when he kisses Charlize Theron (the real villain) right in front of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is a real punch to the gut. Universal \nThe \"Fast\" family will take to the streets of New York for the first time in \"Fate of the Furious.\" While we don't know exactly why they'll be there, we do know that it will involve a lot of vehicular mayhem and a roof-mounted mini-gun. Universal \nWe got a new chrome twist on the Universal logo, one fitting the high-octane car franchise. Even for \"Fast and Furious,\" this is pretty out there -- most of the movies in the series thus far just had the regular old logo. Of course, this may just be a trailer thing. It's cool either way.
