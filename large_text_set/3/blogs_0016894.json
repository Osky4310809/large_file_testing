Photo: Graham Denholm/Getty Images \n\"I had no idea that was going to happen,\" she told the crowd. \"So that was unplanned, I had no idea there, Chris. I'm sorry.\" \nAfter goggling at the engagement ring - and remarking \"Oh, that is sharp\" - Adele offered her congratulations to the pair. Advertisement \n\"Thank you for coming to the show, I hope you enjoy it,\" she said. \"Thank you for doing that, that was emotional.\" A post shared by Ticketmaster Australia (@ticketmasterau) on Mar 19, 2017 at 5:49am PDT \nEmotions were certainly running high during the concert, with the 15-time Grammy-award winner telling off a security guard who was ordering screaming fans to sit down mid-show. \n\"If I see one more person being told to sit down, I swear to god,\" she said. \nThe impassioned performance topped off a wildly successful few weeks for the British singer, who impressed audiences all over the country with her honesty and wit. \nThe numerous \"Adele\" moments have apparently worked a treat, with industry insiders speculating the star could be pulling in around $1 million minimum per show . First, there was that moment at one of her Brisbane concerts where she confirmed she was married to long-term partner Simon Konecki. \nThen, she laughed off an incident where she almost tripped off stage thanks to the length of her dress. And there was also the infamous run-in with Brisbane mosquitoes (\"They're all trying to kill me!\"). \nAustralians also learned that Adele is very self-depreciating, with Perth's weather making her sweat-off her makeup to reveal what she looks like \"in real life\". \nAs Adele bids Australia farewell and makes her way to New Zealand, many will still be left wondering how someone so talented can be so incredibly down-to-earth. But perhaps, like the confetti cannons and tour T-shirts, it's just all part of the show.
