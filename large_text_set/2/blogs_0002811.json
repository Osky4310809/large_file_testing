Donald Trump impeachment effort already underway \nAfter the case Brad Edwards, a lawyer for the ex-members, said he had \"never been more confident after trying a case that this would be the result.\" \nHe added: \"To me, it was just a matter of time before this verdict came but I'm glad we got it.\" \nTrump Organisation lawyer Alan Garten said they were planning an appeal. \n\"The members who resigned were all members under Ritz-Carlton who resigned prior to Trump taking ownership,\" he said, adding that the new President had \"purchased the club from Ritz and effectively saved it because it was in financial ruin. \n\"Notwithstanding the foregoing, we disagree with the judge's ruling and intend to appeal it.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:00:56.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
