The rollout will include a high-end model that costs $1,000 and features two new hardware innovations, at least on the Apple front. The first major change is a curved OLED screen possibly supplied by Samsung, who implemented the technology in their Galaxy S7 Edge. More practical in function will be the new iPhone’s USB-C port. Previous iPhones used the Apple-exclusive Lightning port for inter-device connectivity, forcing consumers to buy additional adaptors and extensions if they wanted to hook their phone up to, say, a Bose speaker. This could indicate a new broad-scale approach from Apple in terms of positioning its product amid the rest of the smart-tech marketplace. \nOne piece of speculation about the 10th-anniversary iPhones that remains unconfirmed is a wireless charging feature. Apple recently joined the Wireless Power Consortium, a tech coalition that seeks to standardize and normalize wireless charging capacities across all our most common devices.
