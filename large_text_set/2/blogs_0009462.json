Water in one practice pool is orange. Turf has turned brown and, along with countless stadium seats, has been inexplicably removed from the field.\nAnd that does not even begin to describe the situation in Rio's favelas, which were supposed to be cleaned up ahead of the start of the Olympics this summer. Instead, as Gizmodo noted , there is sewage and feces flowing through the streets \"in small rivers\".\nOf course, none of this should come as much of a surprise. Time and again we have seen Olympic hosts promise that the billions of dollars spent for the two-week spectacle will have a lasting impact on the local economy and its citizens, only to then watch silently as the venues begin to decay and become abandoned.\nHere's what Rio's Olympic venues looks like just six months later.\nView As: One Page Slides The Olympic golf course took three years to make and caused much ire because it was built in a national wildlife reserve. Now, it's rundown and empty. Nacho Doce/Reuters The Olympic Village, too, is a ghost town.
