The authorities are unable to trace the children now. Sneha Agrawal | Posted by Sanjana Agnihotri 11 children rescued from a brothel in 2015, went missing again. 2 They were handed over to some people who introduced themselves as their parents. 3 However, the authorities now suspect chicanery in the matter and are unable to trace the children. \nMissing, found, and missing again - that appears to be the status of 11 children rescued from a city brothel in 2015 with the issue now in the Delhi High Court. These kids, between 4 and 13 years of age, were handed over to some people who introduced themselves as their parents. But authorities now suspect chicanery in the matter and are unable to trace the children. \nThe Delhi State Legal Services Authority has challenged the order of a city child welfare committee in the HC, saying due process was not followed and sought an inquiry. The high court has issued a notice to the state, the child welfare panel and the child care homes that had kept the children with them. Thousands of kids go missing every year - often abducted for sexual exploitation - and are never found. On June 22, 2015, 56-year-old Anita, a social activist working for the welfare and rehabilitation of the children of sex workers at Delhi's GB Road, rescued 11 kids from the brothel on request from some women claiming to be their mothers. These kids were produced before the CWC in Lajpat Nagar. Of these 11 kids, five were minor boys and six minor girls. Seven children were sent to Jyoti Home and the three boys were sent to Ummeed Aman. \nSix days later, the alleged mothers appeared before the CWC with some unidentified men and demanded to take the children back. The DLSA in the petition says that till the time the children were restored with the parents, these women kept coming to the committee daily and created commotion. \"The Lajpat Nagar police was also informed about the ruckus but did not take action,\" the plea said. \nAlso read: Missing kids: Domestic trouble main reason, says Delhi police \nThe \"parents\" said they were victims of the 2015 Nepal quakes and moved here after their houses were destroyed. While the restoration was still underway legal services advocate Anuradha Vashisht had submitted objections before the CWC Lajpat Nagar, highlighting certain discrepancies. \n\"The interaction of the children revealed that they were brought from Nepal at the time of quake; their nationality is yet to be verified. Bringing kids from Nepal, keeping them in brothel, asking their custody within a period of one month shows something fishy in the matter. Keeping kids in NGO was pre planned to keep children in a safe place. It seems that the children were allured and were kidnapped for some ill motive,\" said Vashisht in her report. \nThe report which was accessed by Mail Today revealed that the address of the children during the rescue was GB Road. However, the address mentioned in the child restoration form is: Majnuka-tilla, Punjabi Basti, Civil Lines, Delhi. The mother's name is different at the time of seeking protection and claiming custody. \nAlso read: Nursing home owner arrested on charges of child trafficking \n\"The interaction of the children revealed that they were brought from Nepal at the time of earthquake, their nationality is yet to be verified.

Keeping children in NGO was pre planned to keep children in safe place. It seems that the children were allured and were kidnapped for some ill motive,\" said Vashishtha. \nIt was suggested a major intercountry racket was trafficking kids affected by the earthquakes. Child rights activist and advocate Anant Kumar Asthana says that restoration of a child is not a foolproof process. When a child is handed over to a parent, regular visits to the kid's home are made for next two years. DLSA alleged that when the time came for the follow-up visits, it turned out that the children could not be traced. \"Restoration of children is carried out casually across the country, largely because child welfare committees lack required degree of procedural and functional competence,\" said Asthana.
