Tretter and giving Joel Bitonio an extension, plus signing veteran receiver Kenny Britt. \nThen they made the biggest move of the day, trading for Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler — a move that left their fans fearing another season with a struggling QB. But when the dust settled, it was clear just what the Browns had netted by taking on Osweiler and his guaranteed $16 million salary for next season. \nThe Browns received a 2018 second-round pick and swapped a fourth-rounder in this year’s draft for Houston’s sixth-rounder. And suddenly they’re sitting on an absolute arsenal of draft picks: 11 in each of the next two drafts. The #Browns draft picks after the Osweiler trade: \n2017: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 62018: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7 \n— NFL GameDay (@NFLGameDay) March 9, 2017 Browns now own 8 picks in the just 1st and 2nd rounds alone of the next two @NFL drafts. \n— Andrew Siciliano (@AndrewSiciliano) March 10, 2017 First quote from the Browns on the Osweiler trade: \"We’re really excited to acquire a second round draft choice in this trade.\" \n— Field Yates (@FieldYates) March 9, 2017 \nAnd that’s not all. The Browns reportedly are discussing Osweiler trade proposals that could reduce his cost to them: Breaking News: Browns shopping Osweiler contract all over the league. Want to trade Brock and late rnd pick for '18 3rd rnd pick … \n— Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) March 9, 2017 Again, Browns shopping Osweiler and late rnd 17, for a 2018 3rd rnd pick and will eat \"at least half\" of Brock's $16M salary \n— Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) March 9, 2017 Browns are fixated on the 3rd round pick in 2018, leading many to believe they're out to deal bevy of picks to NE for Jimmy G \n— Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) March 9, 2017 \nIf the Browns move Osweiler and move on from Robert Griffin III, it remains to be seen whether they’ll draft a potential franchise QB or try to pry Jimmy Garoppolo from the Patriots. Clearly they possess the picks to do it. My understand of #Browns QB situation: They’ll release RGIII. Shop Brock Osweiler and see what comes of it. Likely draft a QB as well. \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 9, 2017 My understanding is #Browns are expected to make a run at Jimmy G. They can offer the most. I do not believe the #Patriots want to trade him \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 9, 2017 \nEither way, Cleveland’s offseason already appears to be infinitely better than its one-win 2016 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:35:42.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
