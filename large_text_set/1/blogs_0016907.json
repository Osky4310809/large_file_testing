Photograph: Glenn Hunt/Getty Images   08.31 GMT Last modified on   08.33   Share on Messenger Close \nThe Queensland government will scrap its lockout laws in exchange for a deal with pubs and clubs to run mandatory identification scanning to enforce bans on selected patrons. \nThe premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk , said on Monday her cabinet had decided to drop its proposed 1am lockout because reduced trading hours already in place would “reduce the level of violence across our state”. \nThe decision came despite an independent report on the first six months of earlier nightclub closures finding the effects on violence levels had been “blurred” because of some venues “abusing the system”, Palaszczuk said.

Read more \nBut Palszczuk said she had been “listening to Queenslanders” and that “many women” had been raising safety issues with her about “travelling home on public transport in the early hours of the morning”. \nShe said forcing venues that trade past midnight to have identification scanners, which copy details of every patron entering, was “good policy”. \nA Deakin university report, commissioned by the government, found that the “widespread and systematic” use of extended trading hour permits to 5am had undermined the impact of 3am closures in nightclub precincts. \nBecause of this, there had not been a single weekend since last July where all venues in Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley had stopped serving alcohol at 3am, it said. \n“The current research evidence suggests that the introduction of lockouts (one-way doors) is not likely to significantly change current trends (except for pre-drinking),” the report said. \nA mandatory scanning network for late-night venues in the state’s main entertainment precincts was already due to take effect next month alongside the lockout. \nThe network, by which venues would share information on patrons banned for violence or what clubs consider misbehaviour, would operate via a database that only “approved operators” of licence scanning systems, and not clubs themselves, could broadly access. \nGuardian Australia can reveal that one of only two government-approved custodians of this data on banned patrons is part-owned by a former internet business operator whom the federal court found guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct in 2004. \nScantek Solutions Pty Ltd, which will transmit information to scanners at venues flagging when a banned patron seeks entry, lists Chesley Paul Rafferty as a director and shareholder – holding 16% of ordinary shares and 34% of employee shares – according to company searches. \nRafferty was taken to court by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over conduct by his web domain names business. \nThe court found Domain Names Australia, and Rafferty as its sole director, breached the Trade Practices Act by sending businesses invoices demanding payment to renew registration of their domain names, when they were actually paying to register a slightly different name. \nThe Deakin university report found there had been “no obvious reduction in alcohol-related assaults” in nightclub precincts or across Queensland since July. \nNor had there been any “significant change in injury presentations at emergency departments during high alcohol hours”, it said. \nBut since the government’s changes, there had been a “continuing downward trend in common and serious assaults” between 8pm and 6am statewide, as well as an ongoing drop in common assaults in Fortitude Valley between 3am and 6am. \nThe Deakin report concluded that restricted trading hours needed to be “actuated” for the governments “last drinks” policy to be effective. \n“It is very important to note that there has been virtually no fidelity to the last-drinks at 3am in [nightclub precincts] across Queensland due to the systematic and widespread use of extended trading permits,” it said. \nIt suggested changes to extended trading hours permits, which are expected to be used for occasions such as New Year’s Eve. \n“The lack of change in alcohol-related harms during earlier hours also indicates that measures used to reduce harm earlier in the night such as ID scanners, and banning orders for repeat offenders continue to be warranted,” the report said. \nPalaszczuk in response said the government would cut the number of extended trading permits from 12 to 6. \nShe said that “some of the data that has been collected is blurred, because some people have been abusing the system”. \n“We need good factual data where people are not misusing the permits,” she said.
