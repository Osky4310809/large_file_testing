And now, out of the blue, the Dark Knight is teaming up with the legendary detective for a new crossover series. Advertisement \nRevealed through The Hollywood Reporter today, the appropriately titled Batman/The Shadow (written by Scott Snyder and Steve Orlando, with art from Riley Rossmo) is a new six-part collaboration between DC and Dynamite Entertainment, and sees Batman track down the murderer of a Gotham citizen to the trail of a man who’s been dead for half a century. Little does Batman know, however, that that man is Lamont Cranston—the mysterious Shadow himself. And naturally, the Shadow isn’t going down without a scrap or two, even against Batman. \nIt’s not actually the first time Batman’s met the Shadow— the two teamed up for two issues in Batman #253 back in the ‘70s —but decades after their last pairing, it’ll be interesting to pit one of comic’s most famous characters against the legend that inspired a whole generation of heroes. Batman/The Shadow #1 is due to hit stores in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:57:46.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
