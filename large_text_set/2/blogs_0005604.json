Nordstrom sold Ivanka Trump shoes and clothing items. \nThe department store chain said on Thursday that it had decided to put the brakes on its relationship with Ms. Trump and removed her brand from a list on its site. “We’ve said all along we make buying decisions based on performance,” Nordstrom said in a statement. “In this case, based on the brand’s performance, we’ve decided not to buy it for this season,” referring to the spring. \nA spokesman for the brand disputed Nordstrom’s assertion that it had not bought clothes for the coming season. \nNordstrom had been subject to the \" #GrabYourWallet \" and \" Boycott Trump \" campaigns due to their affiliation with Ivanka Trump. The creator of #GrabYourWallet, Shannon Coulter, claimed victory on Twitter. Big news everyone. You did this.
