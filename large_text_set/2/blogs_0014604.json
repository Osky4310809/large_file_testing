UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 17 hours ago 4 \nSteven Adler offered a lengthy explanation on what role in the reunited Guns N' Roses originally was, explaining how a physical injury brought everything to a halt. \nThe drummer said on the Mitch Lafon Podcast : \"The understanding was - I was going to do all the ' Appetite ,' ' Lies ,' and three or four of the ' Use Your Illusion ' songs, and then Frank, who is a wonderful awesome guy, he was going to do the ' Chinese Democracy ' stuff and a couple of the other songs. \n\"I was going to start it, he was going to come in the middle, and I was going to end it, and I was cool with that. Even a psychic 9 years ago in Australia I talked to, she said, ‘You're going to be back with them, but you're going to share the stage.’ I went, 'That's cool, as long as it's not Matt Sorum, I'm fine.' Boom! Just kidding Matt, I love you. [Laughs]\" \nSteven continued: \"That would have been cool. I was ready to do the Troubadour show, I had been playing like 25 songs twice a day for almost two years, every day, so I was ready to go. Then the second rehearsal, I came into the rehearsal in March, and fuckin' second day, I just stretched - all I did was stretch. \n\"I pulled my arm and went, 'Ow.' I went, 'I just did something.' Then we played another seven songs, and then my back was really sore, and I came home at about 8 at night, then by midnight I couldn't even stand up. It was just terrible. \n\"I was out for two weeks, and then I got the epidural after about a week, and then I had the surgery. I was ready when they did the Troubadour show, and Duff called me and said, 'Dude, you're not going to play with us anymore, you're not going to do these shows.' \n\"I went, ‘You're the worst fucking person in the world,' and I hung up on him. I called him back and left a message saying, 'I'm so sorry I said that.' When I said he was the worst person in the world, I didn't mean he was, I was thinking I was the worst person in the world. \n\"I couldn't even get back with my fuckin' guys after they gave me this opportunity, but I said it to him. When you have resentment you say things that you're feeling - I was feeling it about me, and I said it about him. I couldn't apologize to him enough, because he knows I love him more than anything. Obviously I got to apologize, because we did shows together, and he understood.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:24:42.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
