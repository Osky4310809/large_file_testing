'We will resist' \nThe event included speeches by human rights groups, abortion rights campaigners, trade union representatives and lawyer and anti-racism campaigner Aamer Anwar. \nThe protestors called on President Trump's proposed state visit to the UK to be cancelled, and for an end to the so-called special relationship between Britain and the US. \nA statement from Scotland Against Trump said it was \"time to fight back\". \nIt added: \"We will stand up and be counted. Trump is the apex of an insurgency of an international far-right. We will resist. We are the majority. We are ready to make our voice heard.\" Image caption Protestors gathered at the Meadows before the march through the capital \nSince January's protests, most of the provisions of Mr Trump's travel ban, which targets seven mainly Muslim countries, have been suspended amid legal challenges . \nThe president insists America's national security is at risk and has indicated he intends to pursue further legal avenues . \nMore than 1.8m people across the UK have signed a petition urging the UK government to withdraw the offer of a state visit to Mr Trump. \nThat, and a counter-petition insisting Mr Trump should be allowed to visit, which gathered more than 300,000 signatures, will be debated at Westminster on 20 February.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:07:29.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
