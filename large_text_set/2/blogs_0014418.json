His argument points to the fact people are taught the earth is round from an early age without a chance to form their own opinion.\n“If you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that, can you really think of us rotating around the sun and all planets aligned?” Irving asked. “There is no concrete information except for the information they’re giving us. They’re particularly putting you in the direction of what to believe and what not to believe. The truth is right there. You just got to go searching for it.”\nPerhaps Irving’s search should take him to Google, where he can find the concrete information he believes is lacking.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:46:50.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
