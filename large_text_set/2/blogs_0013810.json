It’s not as easy to move this time of year,” he says. \nWith little warning from the landlord, he says, 19 families — 80 people altogether, in the 4500 block of North Christiana — were told in January they had one month to leave. \n“We don’t have a lease, but we think it’s unjust that they’re evicting us,” Garcia says, “when we’ve lived in this community and in this building for several years.” \nThe tenants say they’re being forced out because they’re Latino. \nChad Baker is their attorney and predicts the building units will be leased to “mostly non-Latino folks.” \nBaker claims it’s happened at other apartments in the area owned by the Silver Property Group. \n“The charge we are forcing the tenants out of their homes because they are Latino is simply false,” said Ron D. Abrams, of the Silver Property Group. “This is a pure business decision to renovate a recently purchased building.” \n“None of the tenants have leases and are living there on a month-to-month tenancy. Applicable laws provide for termination of the tenancy with a minimum of one full month notice,” Abrams added. \nAbrams said Silver Property offered to discuss the situation with the tenants individually, but “no one has contacted us.” Jim Williams facebook Follow Jim Williams, a native Chicagoan, co-anchors the CBS 2 Chicago Weekend Evening News.
