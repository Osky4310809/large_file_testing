This evening, Roginsky took notice of a Mediaite piece which reported on an Instagram photo of Baldwin wearing a Russian lampoon of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” hats. A photo posted by Alec Baldwin (@iamabfalecbaldwin) on Jan 6, 2017 at 8:26am PST \nWhile various outlets picked up on how Baldwin’s hat has all the standard qualities of Trump’s hats, Roginsky pointed out that the translation wasn’t quite correct. Sigh, Alec Baldwin… that hat is both grammatically incorrect and is more about making America groovy again. https://t.co/86xmaX6HAA \n— Julie Roginsky (@julieroginsky) January 8, 2017 \nMediaite reached out to Roginsky for her translation, and we have received a response: The grammatical declensions of the words are all wrong and the word for \"great\" is better translated as \"awesome\" or \"groovy.\" https://t.co/0cYQ7wDwFt \n— Julie Roginsky (@julieroginsky) January 8, 2017 \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T03:32:00.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
