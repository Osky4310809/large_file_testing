You can watch the stadium rise in real time, thanks to a live-stream viewable on the Rams’ website.\nSo far, the Hollywood Park project site is mostly just a giant pit of dirt, but it’s somewhat hypnotic to watch the tiny workers making their way through the project’s massive footprint.\nOnce complete, the stadium will be the largest in the nation , at nearly 3 million square feet. It’ll include seating for 70,240 fans—and up to 100,000 in standing-room only scenarios. Also planned for the 300-acre project site is a huge urban village with retail, restaurants, a hotel, parks, an artificial lake, and 3,000 units of housing.\nThe stadium is set to open in time for the 2019 football season, so that pit of dirt is liable to see plenty of action in near future. \nObviously still in the early stages of construction, the venue has already been selected to host the 2021 Super Bowl. It will be the first time Los Angeles has hosted the big game since 1993—a year before the Rams relocated to Saint Louis.\nThe Chargers are moving to LA and will share the Rams’ future Inglewood stadium [Curbed LA] Take a look around the construction site for the new Rams stadium [Curbed LA] Take a Good Look Around Los Angeles's Future NFL Stadium [Curbed LA] Los Angeles will host the Super Bowl in 2021 [Curbed LA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T06:52:11.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
