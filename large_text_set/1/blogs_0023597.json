Mr Trump's controversial travel ban has been condemned across the globe (Getty Images) \nThe other four were from Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates - none of which are included in the ban. One million people call for Donald Trump's state visit to the UK to be called off \nChechnya, where Boston Marathon bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were raised before moving to the US, is also exempt. \nThe brothers - ethnic Chechens who lived in the Dagestan region of southern Russia before moving to America around a decade before the 2013 attack - killed three people and injured nearly 300 others. \nThe travel ban has been condemned around the globe, with a Government petition proposing to ban Mr Trump’s state visit to the UK attracting more than a million signatures. Protests erupt outside JFK Airport after President Trump's immigration ban \nProtests have been planned around the world, including in major UK cities on Monday evening, while Hollywood stars hit out at the policy at the Screen Actors Guild in Los Angeles on Sunday. \nUp to 18,000 Londoners have pledged to attend an “emergency demo” and march to Downing Street from 6pm this evening in protest at the policy.
