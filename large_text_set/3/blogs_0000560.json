Externally, the bag is graced by an ultralight 100% nylon ripstop Pertex Quantum fabric to create a shell half the weight and twice the strength of Patagonia’s other down shell fabrics.\nOther fit elements such as a low-profile hood, Houdini fabric liner, and custom food bed also serve to ensure maximum comfort internally.\nThe Patagonia 850 Down sleeping bag is now available online at Patagonia’s official site .\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:33:05.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
