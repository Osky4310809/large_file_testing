Goode” and other classics, has died in St. Charles County, Missouri, west of St. Louis. He was 90.\nSt. Charles county police say they responded to a medical emergency Saturday afternoon and found Berry unresponsive. He could not be revived and was pronounced dead.\nBerry hit the Top 10 in 1955 with “Maybellene” and went on to influence generations of musicians. Among his other hits were “Johnny B. Goode” and “Roll Over Beethoven.”\nHaving found a way to play the pumping rhythms of jumping R&B on the guitar (instead of a piano and saxophone,) Berry developed a unique style of guitar playing that became his signature. His solos were accentuated with bent notes that seemed to scream, and movements that seemed to capitalize on his sense of humor, like his opened-mouth gawking at the audience and his long tradition of “duck-walking,” which guitarists like ACDC’s Angus Young would later borrow.\nThis story will be updated. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \nWatch Chuck Berry play “No Particular Place to Go” in 1958. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:03:12.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
