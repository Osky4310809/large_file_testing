We're going to start making good deals,\" Trump said. \nTrump also said: \"It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, we’re going to be at the top of the pack.\" \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was responding to a question about other countries increasing their nuclear arms: \"The United States will not yield its supremacy in this area to anybody.\" \nTrump made the comments during an interview with Reuters that also touched on issues involving Russia, China, and North Korea. \nIn his interview with Reuters, Trump said: \n• Said Russian deployment of a new type of cruise missile violates an arms control treaty, and he will raise the subject with Putin \"if and when we meet;\" no such meeting is yet scheduled. Trump has been criticized by Democrats who say he has been too friendly toward the Russian leader. \n• Sought to pressure China over the nuclear challenge from North Korea, saying the Beijing government could solve it \"very easily if they want to.\" Trump said he personally is :\"very angry\" at North Korea over recent ballistic missile tests, and may accelerate a missile defense system to protect Japan and South Korea. \nChina, however, has said it would ban all imports of coal from North Korea, which depends on its trade with China for a large chunk of its income. \n• Spoke favorably of some kind of tax on goods flowing across the border, but did not endorse a specific plan. \n\"I certainly support a form of tax on the border,\" he told Reuters. \"What is going to happen is companies are going to come back here, they're going to build their factories and they're going to create a lot of jobs and there's no tax.\" \n• Said the administration will take up tax reform after a plan to change the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care plan.
