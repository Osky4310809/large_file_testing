NFL Twitter’s favorite activity Thursday, meanwhile, seemed to be Photoshopping increasingly more crude variations on the Chargers’ new lightning-bolt L.A. logo.\nAnd the reaction in L.A. itself? A massive yawn.\nActually, that’s not quite right. There was also indignation from L.A. folks who had gotten used to seeing the best national games on TV during their two-decade NFL hiatus but will now — puke — be limited to the woeful Rams and Chargers each week.\nWhile the hapless Spanos is the villain of this story and now a suntanned version of Art Modell, you can also blame the unrelenting greed and complete moral emptiness of the NFL in the Roger Goodell era.\nChargers fans stand around a pile of discarded memorabilia in front of the team’s stadium Thursday. AP The Chargers’ move, as well as being a heartless stab in the back, makes no sense for multiple reasons.\nThe Chargers have no fans in L.A. — merchandise sales show the second-most popular team there is the Raiders — and they are already a year behind the Rams in trying to win fans in the market.\nSpanos won’t get to share in the spoils of the new stadium Rams owner Stan Kroenke is building in Inglewood (former home of the Lakers) because he will be renting, not owning. And if you’ve ever read about Kroenke’s cutthroat ways in real estate over the years, “tenant” is the last thing you want to be with him.\nStan Kroenke Shutterstock Spanos has no head coach at the moment, a bad team with an aging quarterback in Philip Rivers and is all but guaranteed to provide the NFL with two years of embarrassing visuals from being unable to sell out even their 30,000-seat temporary home in Carson. Except, of course, when the Raiders come to town and fill the building in silver and black — a whole other embarrassment.\nThe biggest head-scratcher of all, though, is the money situation. Spanos and the NFL were reportedly just $150 million apart with San Diego on a new stadium, which is a pittance for someone like Spanos and his family estimated to be worth $2 billion.\nBut rather than make up that difference (and allow the city to use that money instead for things that matter, like roads and schools and police salaries), Spanos decided instead on the move to L.A. and the staggering $650 million relocation fee that comes with it.\nHuh?\nApparently, the NFL’s amoral principle of never letting local taxpayers (or taxpaying tourists) off the hook is so important to Spanos he’s even willing to spend an extra $500 million just to spite San Diego residents for not building him a gaudy new sandbox.\nSEE ALSO \nThe Chargers' relocation is just sad for everyone involved :0 Let the San Diego mourning and the Los Angeles moaning...

People laughed at Cuban, but football ratings nosedived this season and the trendline of interest in the sport is no longer pointing forever upward.\nBetraying another good football town in San Diego for rampant disinterest and acres of empty seats is just another self-inflicted NFL wound.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:27:25.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
