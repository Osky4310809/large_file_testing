Frozen solid.” \n“Can’t blame them”? Yes we can. \nEven if you inexplicably didn’t realize we were heading into the deep freeze, there were plenty of folks who still found a way to remove the bulk of the problem Wednesday morning. \nFor the rest? No excuse. \nRelated: State Police Say ‘Don’t Be This Guy’ \nAnd that enabling tweet was nothing compared to an e-mail I got from a usually-thoughtful listener, who wrote of the scofflaws: “I’m sure they don’t want to damage their car by chipping away at it. Sometimes the bureaucrats have to bend to accommodate unusual conditions. As we all know, one size does not fit all.” \nReally? \nBy that logic, the next time I’m in a rush to get home after a long day, maybe I’ll just blow through those red lights. Who does the DPW think they are trying to cramp my style? \nThe point is, there are certain obligations we all have as citizens that are non-negotiable. \nYou have to pay taxes, unless you’re very rich. \nYou have to shovel your sidewalk. \nAnd you have to make sure you’re not a hazard to others on the road. \nTo pretend otherwise is more than a trip to fantasyland by the clueless. \nIt’s downright scary.
