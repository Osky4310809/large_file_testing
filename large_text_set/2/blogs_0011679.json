The bland New General Catalog designation of NGC 2237 doesn't appear to diminish the appearance of this flowery emission nebula . Inside the nebula lies an open cluster of bright young stars designated NGC 2244 . These stars formed about four million years ago from the nebular material and their stellar winds are clearing a hole in the nebula's center, insulated by a layer of dust and hot gas. Ultraviolet light from the hot cluster stars causes the surrounding nebula to glow . The Rosette Nebula spans about 100 light-years across, lies about 5000 light-years away , and can be seen with a small telescope towards the constellation of the Unicorn ( Monoceros ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:36:18.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
