Voter Guide: Should We Give City Hall Power to Legalize Pot Shops? \nMeasure M seeks to make those shops compliant with MCRSA by overturning D and allowing the City Council to issue permits and start taxing and regulating retailers and producers of pot products. The measure, spearheaded by City Council president Herb Wesson, also would allow the body to expand the number of shops in town and legalize delivery services. \n\"This is a framework that allows for control and sensible regulation,\" Spiker of the Southern California Coalition said last month. \"There will also finally be licenses, and operators can do business without looking over their shoulders.\" \nThe measure would also clear the path for recreational pot shops in L.A. Under Proposition 64, which California voters approved in November, recreational sales can begin next year. \nAlso on the ballot was Measure N, organized but abandoned by a group of marijuana dispensaries, the United Cannabis Business Alliance, that's now throwing its weight behind M. Similarly, N would open the door to licensing, taxation, regulation and expansion. But N favored those 135 limited legal immunity shops going forward. \nN was losing — with nearly 55 percent of voters opposed — with about 8 percent of precincts reporting. \n*Updated at 10:40 p.m. with fresh vote figures and a quote from the Southern California Coalition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:16:19.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
