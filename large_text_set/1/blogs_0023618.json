Both artists teased the video via Instagram and Twitter, and fans are having mixed reactions. As a reminder, Swift dated Harry Styles, a member of One Direction. Malik controversially left One Direction to pursue a solo career. Conflict of interest? Perhaps, but that's not enough to stop them from playing love interests in this video. The full video drops Thursday at midnight (technically Friday morning), but you can see the sneak peeks here.
