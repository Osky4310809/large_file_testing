However, if this Lesnar appearance is anything like most of Brock’s Monday Night Raw cameos, The Beast Incarnate will mostly stand silently as Paul Heyman cuts a promo. But with Lesnar being a part of the Royal Rumble Match — and 17 spots remaining to be claimed — could one of the superstars from the red brand have the audacity to interrupt Heyman and his client to announce his own entry into the 30-man battle royal at WWE’s January PPV? Can Roman Reigns bounce back after losing the United States Title to Chris Jericho? [Image by WWE] \nWhile Roman Reigns could invoke his obligatory rematch for the United States Championship, it seems more likely that he’ll remain focused on his WWE Universal Championship Match at Royal Rumble , in which Y2J will be locked in a shark cage above the ring. If Roman Reigns is walking into WrestleMania 34 as the champ, this is almost certainly the match in which Kevin Owens will drop the title. Now that both members of Jeri-KO are holding titles, they claim to be the faces of Raw . Reigns will undoubtedly have something to say about that. \nBayley also has a title shot at the Royal Rumble , in arguably the biggest match of her career. Raw Women’s Champion Charlotte Flair is seemingly unstoppable when it comes to PPV title matches. Is there any chance that Bayley will figure out how to do what Sasha Banks has repeatedly failed to do? One week after Bayley and The Boss lost to Nia Jax and Charlotte, how will the No. 1 contender bounce back? \nFinally, Neville continues his campaign to be recognized as King of the Cruiserweights as he challenges WWE Cruiserweight Champion Rich Swann for the title at Royal Rumble 2017 . With the PPV still two weeks away, which member of the 205 Live roster will Neville look to obliterate on Monday Night Raw ? \nRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:29:34.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
