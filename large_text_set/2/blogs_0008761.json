We have very, very strong vetting. I call it extreme vetting and we're going very strong on security. We are going to have people coming to our country that want to be here for good reason.\"\nTrump also said that \"in honor of the [Ninth Circuit] decision,\" he would likely wait until next week a new measure. \"Perhaps Monday or Tuesday,\" he said.\nTrump's comments came a day after the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a restraining order on his original travel ban. The president has cast the order as crucial for national security.\n\"We'll be doing things to continue to make our country safe,\" Trump pledged at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \"It will happen rapidly. We will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.\"\nThe president's comments were far more restrained than his angry reaction to last week's initial court ruling blocking the travel ban. Trump took aim at both the \"so-called judge\" in that case and the ruling, which he called \"ridiculous.\"\nDemonstrators yell slogans during protests against the travel ban imposed by President Donald Trump's executive order, at Los Angeles International Airport on January 29, 2017. Reuters/Ted Soqui\nTrump continued to conjure images of unspecified danger Friday, saying he had \"learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely president. And there are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen, I can tell you that. We will not allow that to happen.\"\nThe 9th Circuit ruling represented a significant setback for Trump in just his third week in office. The appellate decision brushed aside arguments by the Justice Department that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the United States and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted that Trump \"ought to see the writing on the wall\" and abandon the proposal. The New York Democrat called on the president to \"roll up his sleeves\" and come up with \"a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe.\"\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California promised, \"Democrats will continue to press for President Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional ban to be withdrawn.\" And Trump's former presidential rival Hillary Clinton offered a terse response on Twitter, noting the unanimous vote: \"3-0.\"\nSen.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nCongress' Republican leaders, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, declined to comment.\nUS District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued the temporary restraining order halting the ban after Washington state and Minnesota sued, leading to the federal government's appeal.\nThe Trump administration has said the seven nations — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — have raised terrorism concerns. The states have argued that the executive order unconstitutionally blocked entry based on religion and the travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities.\nTrump and his aides frequently refer to a ruling by a federal judge in Boston who declined last week to extend a temporary injunction against Trump's travel ban. In a separate federal ruling in Seattle, a different federal judge put the ban on hold nationwide; it is that judge's decision that the White House has challenged.\n\"It's a decision that we'll win, in my opinion, very easily and, by the way, we won that decision in Boston,\" Trump said.\nSEE ALSO: How Trump killed Obama's vaunted trade deal — and why it could affect the US for decades NOW WATCH: Trump's doctor and a hair surgeon explain what's going on with his hair Associated Press Trump ban Executive Order Shinzo Abe Supreme Court Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:43:00.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
