Cirilito Sobejana, Joint Task Force Sulu commander, said he and his men consisting of 14 battalions are doing their best to recover not only Kantner but also the 26 other foreign and local hostages being held by the Abu Sayyaf. \nMalacañang and presidential adviser on the peace process Jesus Dureza said the government stands firm on its no-ransom policy. \n“The AFP has been directed to continue and intensify its military operations,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said in a statement yesterday. \nAbella added the government is working closely with concerned local governments as well as other sectors to facilitate the safe rescue of Kantner and the other hostages. \n“We have enough forces to do that (rescue operations) but we cannot do it alone. We also need the support of civilians, particularly (in) communities where these hostages are being brought,” Sobejana said.   \nIn a video released Tuesday, the Abu Sayyaf bandits threatened to execute Kantner if the P30-million ransom demand is not paid by Feb. 26. \nLast year, the bandits executed two Canadian captives – Robert Hall and John Ridsdel – when their families failed to pay the huge ransom they were demanding. \nHall and Ridsdel, along with Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad and their Filipina companion Maritess Flor, were kidnapped from the Island Garden City resort in Samal Island, Davao del Norte in September of 2015. \nEnding up in Sulu, the four were also paraded by their captors to relay their ransom demand. \nIn last Tuesday’s video, Kantner is seen kneeling and appeared to be appealing for help from his family and the German government. \nKantner was kidnapped from a yacht in November of last year in waters off Sabah while his female companion was killed. – With Jose Rodel Clapano, Alexis Romero  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:14:07.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
