RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Sessions Confirmed as Attorney General ] \nThe president added that he is ordering the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security \"to undertake all necessary and lawful actions to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and [are] destroying the blood of our youth.\" \nReferring to Sessions, he later said, \"these dangerous times require a determined attorney general.\" \nThe executive orders range in scope. One aims to improve cooperation between agencies in combating international criminal organizations and drug cartels, while another directs the attorney general to form a task force on reducing crime. \nThe third calls for a review of federal laws that could lead to legislation creating new crime categories and penalties for attacks on law enforcement officers. \nIn May, Louisiana became the first state to make targeting an officer a hate crime through legislation known as the \"Blue Lives Matter\" bill that easily passed the legislature and was signed into law by the state's Democratic governor. During the presidential campaign, Trump said he would issue an executive order mandating the death penalty for anyone who killed a police officer, though Thursday's directives do not include such language and that type of order likely would face substantial legal hurdles . \nBoth Trump and Sessions have portrayed America as in the grips of a crime wave, despite FBI data and public policy experts indicating otherwise. \nSessions, who was confirmed by the Senate as attorney general in a near-party line vote Wednesday evening , said at Thursday's ceremony that \"the rise we're seeing in violent crime\" is a \"dangerous, permanent trend,\" echoing similar remarks the GOP senator from Alabama made during a confirmation hearing last month. \nViolent crime in the nation's 30 largest cities increased by about 3 percent in 2016, while the murder rate leaped 14 percent, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law. \nRoughly half the increase in homicides, however, was attributable solely to Chicago, which saw a 50 percent surge in killings. A handful of cities, meanwhile, were mostly behind the increase in violent crime. \nOverall, the nation's crime rate held steady last year, increasing just 0.3 percent after a fall of 2.6 percent in 2015. \n[ READ: Law-and-Order Sessions Echoes, Departs from Trump ] \nTrump's and Sessions' stances on crime – in many ways a reflection of traditional law-and-order conservatism – won support from law enforcement groups such as the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. \nPolice officers did see a higher rate of fatalities in 2016. Sixty-six officers were feloniously killed last year, up from 41 the year before for an increase of 61 percent and the highest death toll since 72 officers were killed in 2011, according to FBI data. \nSessions, during his confirmation proceedings, attributed much of the blame for the attacks on officers – and the rise in violent crime overall – to the protests of police violence that filled city streets in the U.S. \n\"We are failing to appreciate police officers who place their lives at risk,\" Sessions testified. \"To smear whole departments places officers at risk,\" he said, adding that he didn't think \"there's any doubt\" that criticism of police has led to more attacks on officers. \nCivil rights groups and public policy experts have disputed that characterization.
