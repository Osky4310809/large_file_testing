Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA group of teenagers dumped their McDonald's to rescue an elderly man blown off his feet during Storm Doris. The group of four college students had been enjoying a lunch break in Corby, Northamptonshire, on Thursday afternoon as the deadly storm reached its peak across the UK. One of the boys were shocked to see an elderly man being blown off his feet, leaving him lying flat on the floor. Adam O’Neill then alerted his friends Liam Meney, Ryan Mcauley and Harry Glass – all 16-years-old – and they rushed to his aid, leaving their belongings behind. With the help of passers-by, they put him in recovery position, called for an ambulance, shielded him from the strong winds and stayed by his side until paramedics arrived and took him to hospital. The incident unfolded outside this McDonald's restaurant in Corby, Northants (Photo: Google Maps) \nThe teenagers then went back to McDonald’s to finish off their lunch, before returning to Tresham College to carry on their sports studies. But little did they know that a picture taken of them by an amazed onlooker after they returned to the fast food restaurant would see their actions go viral. And speaking exclusively to the Mirror Online, Adam has told how the reaction has left the young group ‘overwhelmed’. “When I got home, I noticed a couple of friends had tagged me in the picture. One day later it had over 80,000 likes!” Adam said.

We were just doing a good deed!” It is believed that the man was taken to hospital with several cuts and bruises, including a gash to his hand that required stitches. He has since returned home. While being looked after by the teenagers, Adam says he and Ryan walked to the elderly man’s car to check he had not received a parking ticket, and to alert the parking attendant to what had happened. And when the group returned to McDonald’s, although they found their food had been thrown away the staff gave them all a free hot drink as a reward for their kind act. Thirza O'Boyle watched the boys rush to the man's aid, and asked to take their picture afterwards - which has since gone viral on Facebook (Photo: Facebook / Thirza Smith O'Boyle) \nAmong those impressed by what the group did was Thirza O’Boyle, a mum-of-three who witnessed the whole scene unfold in front of her eyes while eating at the same fast food restaurant with her son. It was her who asked the teenagers for a picture after they returned, so that she could share the story of what happened on Facebook.
