(Photo: Michael Reynolds, European Pressphoto Agency) \nWASHINGTON — Rick Perry, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Energy secretary, will explain to senators Thursday how he plans to lead the federal agency he once said he wanted to eliminate. \nPerry, a former Texas governor and one-time rival of Trump, will answer questions during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nTrump has boasted that, as governor, Perry created the business climate that produced millions of new jobs and low energy prices in Texas and has said Perry would bring that same approach to the country as Energy secretary. \nBut Perry is almost certain to face questions about his qualifications for the job — he’s not a scientist, as his two predecessors have been — and about his ties to the fossil fuel industry. \nRead more: Rick Perry, who said he wants to scrap Energy Dept., may lead it \nPerry owns stock in Energy Transfer Partners, the Dallas-based company that is trying to build the disputed Dakota Access pipeline. He has said he would divest his interests in the company no later than 90 days after he is confirmed. He also resigned from the company’s board of directors at the end of last year. \nPerry also will likely be asked his views on nuclear energy, whether the United States should resume underground testing of its nuclear weapons and whether the government should revive the stalled plan to store radioactive waste at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain. \nA vocal skeptic of climate change, he could face questions on whether he believes reducing carbon emissions is important. \nPerry ran unsuccessfully for the presidency twice — in 2012 and again in 2016, when he and Trump attacked each other vehemently. \nIt was during the 2012 campaign that Perry had his infamous “oops” moment. During a debate in late 2011, he said he wanted to eliminate three Cabinet agencies, but he could only name two of them. Energy was the department he forgot. Facebook Posted!
