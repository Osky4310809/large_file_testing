The tagging aficionado and general baseball wizard ‘s talents don’t stop when he’s done playing for the Chicago Cubs, apparently. Playing for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic, he broke this gem out Tuesday night, celebrating a tag at second before he had even laid it down: Got 'em so good, @javy23baez doesn't even have to look. #WBC2017 pic.twitter.com/fNLbXFejJt \n— WBC Baseball (@WBCBaseball) March 15, 2017 \nHere’s an extended look at it: \n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) March 15, 2017 \nThe put-out came at a critical spot in Puerto Rico’s game against the Dominican Republic. Adrian Beltre was up to bat as the tying run in the top of the eighth, with Nelson Cruz on first. On a 1-0 pitch, Cruz took off, and catcher Yadier Molina threw the on-target throw to Baez to end the threat. Puerto Rico went on to win 3-1 to kick off Pool F second-round play in San Diego, of which the United States is also a part. \nIf you were worried Baez might not have any new tricks up his sleeve for the 2017 season, it appears you’re mistaken.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:59:39.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
