He was taken to hospital by his mother to check his knee, according to his grandmother Ida Winn. \nThe incident happened Wednesday morning at the Port Arthur convenience store in Jefferson County, Texas according to KHOU.com. The driver pulled up and got out of the car followed by three other children while a fourth sibling remained in the backseat. \nThe family say they don’t know how the car shifted back into gear but say Jayden’s 14 year old brother jumped into the front seat to stop the car from going any further. \n\"If he was more over to the left this could've been actually serious. But like I said you know I just thank God that he's okay and that he was in the position he was in when he walked into the store,\" Winn said. \nThe City of Port Arthur is not releasing any further details on the crash, according to 12 News Now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:48:55.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
