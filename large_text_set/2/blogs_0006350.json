Many of you may be taken for a ride if you are looking primarily at institution buildings, location, residential facilities, placement records, curriculum, research labs, tuition fees, Quality of the website, national and international rankings, excellence awards, prominent visitors to the institution etc. \nI am in no way saying that all these things are less important, but what I want to emphasize is that all these things will automatically be there if there are excellent human resources in the institution. So to make your task of selection easy, I will recommend you to just do a comparative analysis of the faculty of the institutions you are looking at. \nThe logic for this recommendation is simple to understand. Institutions can have good infrastructure and resources but may not have faculty who are passionate and have a drive to do something. Reverse is not true; to have and retain best teachers in your institution, it must have all the requisite infrastructure and facilities in place. \nSome institutions may show you a historic placement record, but that does not guarantee that you have been fully prepared for the job. There are many examples where there has been cases of fake appointment letters and companies asking the new recruits to leave after initial training period. Looking from another angle, if you have been mentored by some of the bright minds, then you are an enterprise in yourself and can lead a career of your choice. \nCurriculum can be easily configured as a world class collection of courses with the help of a consultant or using online resources, but if there are top experts sitting in that institution as a teacher, then they themselves are the live embodiment of the cutting edge material in their domain. So the primary need is good teachers in this case also. \nCostly research labs can be installed with one time investment, but more important is the availability of energetic faculty who can come up with new ideas and projects in those research labs to utilize the latest equipment and tools. Research oriented faculty will not even stick to that place in the absence of advanced research facilities. So what matters is ‘good research oriented faculty’. \nTuition Fees may be less in some places due to Govt funding/policies or Tuition Fee may be more in case of modern private institutions. That does not in any way reflect the quality of the institution. Some institutions with high tuition fee are spending most of the profits in opening new campuses and courses; instead of spending it to increase the quality of the faculty. \nSome youngsters are looking at the quality of the websites of the institutions to make up their mind and many times they regret later. Most of the time website information is tailored to meet the marketing requirements of the institution and does not portray the real scenario of the institution. Some of the institutions don’t even show up the list of faculty on the website. You may even think of visiting the institution and interacting with faculty to get the real feel of the things on the ground. \nNational and international rankings are another dilemma for the students. Competing ranking agencies are giving dissimilar ranks to different institutions. In other words every institution has good position to show in few of the rankings. Each ranking agency is using entirely different methodology to serve their own interests. Some of the parameters being used may have no relevance to the program you want to enrol. \nSimilar is the case of awards. Every institution advertisements are having excellence awards from one or the other agency. You need to be very careful to be carried away by such things. \nEvery institution is showing some celebrities, national or world leaders coming to the conferences, convocations or other events in their institutions. Needless to say, most of the time these are paid visits and there are third parties helping the institutions to arrange such visits. \nBut, if there is good faculty in the institution then empowered teachers act like the magnets to attract rankings, awards and visitors for that institution. So, what you need to look at it is the relative quality of the faculty. \nThere are other characteristics of the internal quality of any institution which may not be seen from the outside and cannot be measured. These traits are: enabling academic freedom in the classes, inculcating understanding of different cultures, Internationalization of campus environment, overall personality growth through co-curricular activities, imparting life skills with outreach and excursions, access and exposure to niche projects and pedagogy, debating the status quo and enabling the growth of new ideas, encouraging the enterprising mind-set etc. These all things can be guaranteed only if different schools and departments are buzzing with the spirited, skilled, intelligent and knowledgeable faculty. \nAnd take my words, if there is good faculty in the institution then all other things can be taken for granted but the converse is not true. \nThis even applies to the specific subjects or courses you may need to choose. Because there may be variations in the quality of the faculty in different departments of the same institution. \nAs a faculty myself, it is so much fun and satisfying if you are surrounded by such brilliant minds and doing team work to solve some of the problems of the society. This type of system enables you to develop some of the futuristic technologies to increase the quality of life of public in general and for the underprivileged and specially-abled people in particular. \nEven in old golden days the ‘Gurukulas” were known by their Acharya (Teacher). In Nalanda and Takshshila universities students were known by the lineage of Acharya’s under whom they have taken their teachings. \nIn Modern world also, at the higher echelons of academic world, young faculty is known by their Ph.D. or Masters Supervisors. Recommendations are key components of hiring of students by Ivy League Universities. \nSo all these things point in the same direction and justify the following line… \nSingle most important thing you should look out in selecting a College/University is the quality of people you will interact with during your stay at the campus.
