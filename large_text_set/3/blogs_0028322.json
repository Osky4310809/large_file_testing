The campaign begins in Australia this Sunday with Abu Dhabi again bringing the curtain down on the season on November 26. \nThere are now also only 10 teams again after Manor collapsed in January after years on the breadline. \nNew colours F1's new era has ushered in a series of dramatic livery changes. McLaren have returned to orange for the first time since the 1970s, while Toro Rosso have swapped their long-time navy blue for a lighter shade and metallic finish. \nForce India have gone pink, while Sauber and Haas are also sporting revised paint jobs for 2017. \nBig name technical moves Personnel changes for 2017 haven't been confined to the driver market with two of F1's leading technical figures signing for new teams. \nAfter four years at the technical helm of Mercedes' world championship-winning juggernaut, Paddy Lowe has rejoined Williams to replace Pat Symonds as the team's new chief technical officer. Meanwhile, former Ferrari and Renault whiz James Allison has arrived at Mercedes as their new technical director. In a year of dramatic change, watch Sky F1's 2017 season opener ahead of the Australian GP \nUnrestricted engine development The hybrid turbo engines remain for a fourth season but manufacturers are now free to develop them without restriction. \nThe unpopular 'token' system has been scrapped, but the catch is that teams can still only use four power units on each of their cars without penalty during the season. This is one less than 2016 when the regulations allowed for a fifth engine owing to a 21-race schedule. \nOld engine elements cannot be retrofitted with updates, meaning teams will have to coincide major updates with scheduled engine changes to avoid penalties. Don't miss a thing with Sky F1 in 2017 \nClampdown on engine stockpiling Remember those ludicrously high grid penalties of recent seasons? Well, in a bid to discourage teams from introducing a raft of engine elements in one go, the regulations now state that if 'a driver introduces more than one of the same power unit element which is subject to penalties, only the last element fitted may be used at subsequent events without further penalty'. \nStanding starts in wet races Even if a rain-affected race starts behind the Safety Car, the race director now has the option to line the field back up on the grid for a normal standing start once conditions have sufficiently improved, rather than initiating a rolling getaway as has hitherto been the case. That only doesn't apply if the race has been red-flagged after the initial Safety Car-controlled laps.
