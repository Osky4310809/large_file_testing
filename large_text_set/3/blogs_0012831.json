It was so thick that we couldn’t even see the far end of the lobby.” \nNarrow escape \nThe situation could have been worse as the fire alarm did not go off in time at the hotel. \n“What added to our concern was the fire alarm didn’t go off, so we assumed it to be a small fire accident. But when there was a strong burning smell, we were asked to vacate immediately. The seriousness of it struck us only when we got out. The smoke spread to our rooms as well. That is when we were asked to run down the stairs,” Jaggi added. Delhi: Fire had broken out in store in Dwarka's Welcome hotel complex.
