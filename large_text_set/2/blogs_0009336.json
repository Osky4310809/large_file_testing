Critics of the guidance argue Obama’s Justice and Education Departments attempted to rewrite the definition of “sex” in “sex-based discrimination” to include gender identity and Republicans have asserted that the decision imposed federal mandates by unlawfully sidestepping Congress. \n“We are proud to lead a 13-state coalition against the Obama administration’s latest illegal federal overreach,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement at the time. “This president is attempting to rewrite the laws that were enacted by the elected representatives of the people, and is using the threat of losing federal funding to get schools to fall into line. That cannot be allowed to continue.” \nThe court placed a temporary injunction on the matter pending review. In so doing the judge said that Title IX “is not ambiguous” about sex being defined as “the biological and anatomical differences between male and female students as determined at their birth.” \nThe Obama administration filed a motion last year to have the judge set aside the temporary injunction. \nBut now it appears that the Trump administration is withdrawing that motion. \nFrom ABC: \nIn a filing Friday with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal government asked to withdraw a motion filed last year that asked a judge to scale back a temporary injunction blocking Obama’s guidance on the issue. \nThe Department of Justice’s filing, which came a day after Jeff Sessions was sworn in as Trump’s attorney general, said the parties were “currently considering how best to proceed in this appeal.” \nIt is not clear yet what the Trump administration will ultimately decide. However, if the government backs off, that will leave each state the ability to decide on its own. Congress can also consider if they want to change and broaden the laws. \nAs it should be, since they make the laws, not former President Obama.
