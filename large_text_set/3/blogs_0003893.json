We sure think so, and according to the actress, she’s all-in on the mom idea in real life too. In fact, This Is Us brought out Moore’s maternal side and joked that she and Milo act like doting parents to the child actors on set.\nOn Wednesday, Moore stopped by Conan and of course talked about her wonderful This Is Us family, and babies…adorable babies. She explained that the NBC series and her role as Rebecca made her “totally ready to have kids.”\nWhile she wants kids even more now, the A Walk to Remember actress admitted she had NO experience with babies before taking this role.\n“I mean, we get to hold these newborn children, and I can’t believe their parents were willing to hand over their babies to me,” Moore told the show’s host Conan O’Brien . “I’m like, ‘Hi, I’m Mandy. I have absolutely no experience with small children,’ and they’re like, ‘Here’s my two-week-old baby.'”\nHappy belated bday, sweet @theparkerbates! Hope you had a fantastic day of celebration. Miss you and can't wait to see you and your \"siblings\" in a few months (@lonniechavis and @mackenziehancsicsak). ⭐️ \nA post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm) on Mar 2, 2017 at 7:28am PST \nLuckily, the cast and crew stepped in to help and made her feel even more ready for baby duty. “I didn’t know how to change a diaper,” she said.\n“I had crew members showing me how to change a diaper,” she continued. “I’m terrible, but yes it has sort of activated that maternal side of me that I’m totally ready to have kids now.” \nDouble the trouble. On set with almost all of the children. #thisisus \nA post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm) on Dec 9, 2016 at 10:28am PST \n“We have three extraordinary young actors on the show, who have fantastic parents by the way. They’re very attentive,” Moore explained about her TV children. “I think it’s a lot of their first jobs for most of them and any time there’s a scene that requires them to eat, I have to remind them [to slow down].”\nThe 32-year-old actress then told a hilarious story about how both she and Milo Ventimiglia take their role as parents on set very seriously. “Milo, who’s my husband on the show, we’re always like, ‘Guys slow down because you guys don’t realize you’re committing yourself to eating that same amount for the entirety of the scene which can sometimes be a couple hours,'” she said.\nAlso, I love this shot of Mi and me sitting on the floor, waiting to finish a day of interviews about @nbcthisisus, moments after getting the good news that we get to play Jack and Rebecca for atleast 2 more years. Thanks for documenting this moment, @miloanthonyventimiglia. #thisisus #stillpinchingourselves \nA post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm) on Jan 27, 2017 at 7:26am PST \nMoore also recalled a funny candy story from set saying, “I remember we were shooting the Christmas episode and there was some melted peppermints in a candy dish that wasn’t even from the prop department. Clearly, it was set decoration and I turn my back for one second…and all of them have jammed peppermints in their mouths!” We think the Tangled actress will make a great mom, especially after all of her This Is Us experience. Who wouldn’t want to have Moore as they mom? She’s the best.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T21:18:17.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
