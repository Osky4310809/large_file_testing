Armed with these assets she embarked on a journey of self discovery, to put her passion to the test and to conquer her dream. But along the way something most girls fear and love happened to her – she fell in love. Chidinma Anyah \nAnd with love comes complications. For Chidinma, her budding career had to be put on hold because her love, her boyfriend, didn’t take kindly to acting. She had to stop even when the career was beginning to grow wings to fly. It was all for love, as long as her love remained with her. But how wrong she was. \n“Seriously, I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t have any intention of ever leaving acting again because the man I left it for is no longer with me. I hate going into the details, all I can tell you is that he became a chronic cheat and I got tired of accommodating him,” she said. \nChidinma, who is from Aniocha, Delta State, celebrated her birthday on March 14, with some sexy, lively pictures. She has since featured in many films like Banana Island, Dorobucci Love, Stubborn Beans, Oma in Lagos, the Stupid Ghost and Hard Fate , to mention a few.
