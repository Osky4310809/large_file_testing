Barack Obama comes out on top!\nOn January 20, the controversial President-elect will have his inauguration where he will begin his four-year term. But how many people are expected to show up to the ceremony??\nRelated: The Porta-Potties At Donald Trump's Inauguration Are Being Censored \nIt depends who you ask!\nAccording to the inauguration planners, they are expecting around 900,000 people at the National Mall. On the other hand, The D.C. Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management is planning for 800K to 900K, while The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Activities (JCCIC) expects 700K to 750K.\nThe biggest estimate comes from Destination D.C. who is anticipating one million people, including protestors.\nRegardless of which number is most accurate, Trump's swearing-in ceremony will most likely attract less people than Barack Obama's. In 2009, Barry's event gathered 1.8 million, while his 2013 inauguration drew around one million. \nHowever, these figures are simply estimates, and you should be wary of anything you read. According to Arizona State University professor Steve Doig :\n\"Take any estimate with a grain of saltâ€¦ What you need to do is look carefully at how the estimate was done and how transparent the group who did it is about their methods.\" \nEither way, Obama is still the man of the people! \n[ Image via WENN . ] \nTags: barack obama , ceremony , donald trump , inauguration , politik", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:10:40.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
