Entirety of television owner Ryan Murphy admitted he was just a little bit tipsy when he went on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live last week and told that annoying but kind of hot (don’t judge) Andy Cohen that the next season of American Horror Story would be about the 2016 election . Ryan even hinted that Donald Trump might be a character.\nDespite that being a valid topic for a show about abject horror, Ryan nows says that he was shittoed and exaggerating.\n\nVia Indiewire :\n“The themes of ‘American Horror Story’ have always been allegories,” he said, while accepting his award for Television Showmanship of the Year. “You will not see [Donald] Trump and [Hillary] Clinton as characters on the show.”\n“Watch What Happens Live” is known for serving its guests plenty of booze, which Murphy blames for the slight misdirect. “They gave me three martinis in 20 minutes! That’s not good.”\nRyan was speaking at the Publicists Guild Awards Luncheon in Beverly Hills, CA. He did note that one of his many muses, actress Sarah Paulson , would make a helluva propaganda ministress and alternative facts expert.\nOf course, on stage Friday at the Beverly Hilton, Murphy couldn’t help but make another joke, after “The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story” star Sarah Paulson handed him the award. As she stood nearby, he quipped, “Now as I look over at Sarah Paulson, I think of Kellyanne Conway. I don’t know! I might be rewriting!”\nI’m not sure even an actress of Sarah Paulson’s caliber could quite capture the extremity of self-delusion necessary for that performance. Ryan, who’s got four shows and counting going on, also spoke out about a tweet he received telling him that the election idea for AHS was a little much.\nMeanwhile, Murphy also took offense at a tweet that he saw from a “straight, white critic,” who wrote – in response to the original news – “Sometimes you just need to say no.”\nMurphy said he considered it a message to FX CEO John Landgraf “that I apparently needed to be put in my place and quick. This is after not even a word of the season has been written. Was this a white wine spritzer after a hard day at the office reviewing ‘Big Little Lies’ tweet? Maybe. But later that week I had dinner with my friend Lena Dunham and we were talking about this tweet and we came to the conclusion that this idea of infantilizing, of ‘stay in your box,’ of not expressing yourself or what you’re interested in is something that gay people and women and people of color have to endure all the time in this world and this industry.”\nThe tweeter had a point. Ryan brings some sick shit to the small screen (there are parts of the last season of AHS that even made MY gorge rise, and I’m a horror fan), but nothing would be as disturbing as having to watch the grotesquerie that was Election 2016 again on a weekly basis. Imagine their take on Twitler’s wig? Blech.\nPic : WENN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:27:33.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
