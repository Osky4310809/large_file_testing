A judge will have to approve it before it becomes official. Richard Toussaint \nHe founded Forest Park along with Dr. Wade Barker and others as an out-of-network hospital. That allowed it to set its own prices for services, meaning the hospital was paid higher rates than in-network providers. The hospital's owners initially refused to join insurance networks to allow its physician investors to profit from the higher reimbursements, federal authorities say. \nFrom 2009 to 2013, the now-bankrupt medical center billed patient insurance plans more than $500 million and collected over $200 million in paid claims, federal prosecutors said. \nToussaint, an anesthesiologist, first met Barker in 2003 and began providing anesthesia for his cases in 2005, according to the plea document. The highest bidder \nToussaint would follow Barker around to various hospitals and noticed that Barker, a bariatric surgeon, \"would always take his patients to the highest bidder,\" meaning the hospital that paid him the most for bringing his patients to its facility, the document said. \nTwo of those hospitals were identified in the plea document as \"Hospital A\" and \"Hospital B.\" \nThe first one paid Barker between $5,000 and $10,000 a month. The kickbacks were disguised as \"marketing payments,\" the document said. \nBarker's lawyer could not immediately be reached. Wade Barker \nBarker also was paid by Vista Hospital, an aging former psychiatric hospital in Garland that was run by co-defendant Alan Beauchamp, the document said \n\"Vista was a dumpy, beat up hospital. But Barker took his patients there because Beauchamp paid him the most money,\" the plea document said. \nBarker told the hospitals that they need to pay him because he helped them make money from insurance reimbursements, according to the document. \n\"Baker would not take his surgeries to nicer hospitals like Baylor or Presbyterian because they would not pay Baker for those patients,\" the document said. \nAround 2008, Toussaint and Barker started their own physician-owned hospital, which became Forest Park Medical Center. It targeted bariatric and spinal surgeons because \"their surgeries generated the most money,\" court documents said. \n\"Toussaint knew that he would have to compete with other hospitals to get surgeries, and that Barker was going to take his cases to the highest bidding hospital,\" the plea document said. \nAt the time, Hospital B was paying Barker about $25,000 a month for his cases, the document said. \nEven though Barker owned a substantial share of Forest Park, he \"made it clear he was not going to accept\" less that than from Forest Park if the hospital wanted his surgeries, according to the document. \nForest Park began recruiting its own doctors. But most of them \"were already being paid marketing payments from other hospitals in exchange for their cases being performed at those hospitals,\" the document said. \nBeauchamp decided who to pay and how much, prosecutors say, \nForest Park's kickbacks quickly grew from $30,000 a month to more than $1.2 million per month. \nDr. William Nicholson was performing his surgeries at Baylor and initially did not want to leave the hospital unless Forest Park \"offered him something,\" the plea document said. He eventually accepted money to bring his surgeries to Forest Park, according to the document.

Kim had been performing his surgeries at other hospitals but complained that they were not supporting his practice, \"which Toussaint understood to mean that they were not paying him sufficiently in exchange for his cases.\" \nToussaint said one of those hospitals was paying Kim about $10,000 a month for his surgeries, the plea document said. \n\"Beauchamp told the board that Kim was coming on board and that he needed two operating rooms and wanted marketing money,\" the plea document said. \nLawyers for Nicholson and Kim could not be reached. Shares for surgeries \nForest Park also offered its referring doctors an opportunity to invest in the hospital to sweeten the pie, prosecutors say in court documents. \n\"The more surgeries a surgeon could bring to FPMC, the more they were allowed to invest and profit from the hospital's billings,\" the plea document said. \"Surgeon investors who did not bring enough surgical cases to FPMC were divested or their shares were cut.\" \nWhen Forest Park cut its kickback payments in late 2012, many of the surgeons stopping bringing their patients to the hospital, the plea document said. Others were furious \nShortly before the cuts, a competing hospital had offered Nicholson \"marketing money\" to attract his surgery cases, according to the plea document. \n\"Barker told Toussaint that he did not think the other facility would offer Nicholson more than the $75,000 a month that FPMC was paying him.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:41:51.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
