A video posted by Ángel Di María (@angeldimariajm) on Jan 27, 2017 at 8:35am PST \nDi Maria’s ability has never been in question, but his ability to perform on a consistent basis has. \nHe struggled at Old Trafford and is yet to show his true colours in France. \nBelief is a big part of his game, though, and PSG will still be looking to the 28-year-old to help spearhead a pursuit of major honours on multiple fronts this season.
