Ribery will feel hollow after this (Photo: FC Bayern Munich) \nIn Munich training the stars were playing their favourite game - El Rondo. \nRibery somehow found himself as the piggy in the middle, and he was soon made to pay. Rushing in to challenge Brazil's Rafinha, the Frenchman was rewarded with a delicious nutmeg. Ribery took it in good jest (Photo: FC Bayern Munich) \nThe right back delicately rolled the ball through his opponent's legs sending his teammates spare. \nGood job Ribery took it in good fun.
