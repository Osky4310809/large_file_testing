And no, it’s not Corinne Olympios ’ boobs. (There’s still time for that!) \nOn the Monday, January 9, episode, spirited photographer Franco Lacosta had Nick Viall ’s ladies to dress as brides, asked them to kiss their leading man — it didn’t take much begging — then shot their coveted wedding pictures. Now, he’s recounting the, er, rosy experience exclusively with Us Weekly . PHOTOS: 'The Bachelor' Season 21: Meet Nick Viall's Bachelorettes! \n“Nick is a hot piece and so fun to work with because he was down to push boundaries,” Lacosta, who has been featured on America’s Next Top Model , tells Us . “He understands the pressure of the show and he’s a gentleman in all ways. Nick is Batman and I felt like Alfred. You have to get through to me to get to him.” Lacosta and Olympios Rick Rowell/ABC via Getty Images \nThe day of the shoot, Lacosta admits his mission was to “ignite the fun and sexual energies” of the women vying for Viall. And he certainly succeeded, especially when season 21’s villain Olympios slipped into the pool — and out of her bikini top . “Corinne was just playing a game and being seductive. I thought it was great, but the other girls were dying! They were saying, ‘Oh, my God, I would never do that!'\" recalls Lacosta. “She was confident. She said, ‘Franco, I want to do something different and special. I want to make it like Janet Jackson ’s Rolling Stone cover.’ Nick was shocked! He had no idea that was coming. But I just told him, ‘You grab those babies! She’s going for it and you have to go for it.’ \nThe bare-all move won her the group date — and a spot in Lacosta’s heart. “ I loved how she was spicy and vivacious !” he says. “She was my favorite. You have to be a lady in the streets and a freak in the sheets to get Nick!” Rick Rowell/ABC via Getty Images PHOTOS: Biggest Reality TV Villains Ever! \nThere’s competition for Viall’s rose, though. Lacosta says he was also impressed with grade school teach Sarah Vendal and special education teacher Vanessa Grimaldi . “Vanessa had great energy, which I loved. But she has to step up her game. She really seemed intimidated that day. If she can get out of her head, she has a lot going for her,” he tells Us . “Sarah, too. There’s something special there. I wanted to make the shoot energetic and bring the passion out of every girl. Corinne, Vanessa and Sarah really brought what I was looking for and what Nick was into.” \nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET . \nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!
