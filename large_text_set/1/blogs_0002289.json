But without that, they agreed, the charges might as well be dropped.\n“If you believe that he’s not going to become competent, then what’s the point?” Chief Deputy District Attorney Charles Gallagher III told Judge Banach. “We ask you to dismiss the charges.”\nBanach said she would reconsider her decision if new evidence came to light and a hearing was held in December to determine whether Snuka, a Florida resident, could stand trial.\nBanach told the court on Tuesday that Snuka’s condition was too severe and that she would need to drop the charges.\nBack in June, an expert for the prosecution testified that the wrestling icon’s brain showed normal signs of aging and it appeared as if he may be pretending to have dementia. But Banach later shot down these claims, saying there was no chance.\n“I don’t believe he’s faking it,” she said at the time. “I don’t think he’s smart enough to fake it,”\nWhile Snuka — a native of Fiji who tied up with some of the sport’s greats in the 1970s and ’80s, including Rowdy “Roddy” Piper and Don Muraco — had been a “person of interest” in the Argentino case for years, but wasn’t charged until 2015 after new evidence and witness testimony was presented to a grand jury.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:22:40.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
