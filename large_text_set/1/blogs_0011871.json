Due to his noble actions, valor and bravery that saved many Elves during the Fall of Gondolin, he was re-embodied after a short time. \nA thousand years later, in SA 1600 , Manwë sent him back to Middle-earth as an emissary of the Valar and granted him powers nearly as strong as that of the Maiar 's. [8] Third Age \nIt is possible that Glorfindel remained for a time in Lindon along with the other noble Elves, such as Gil-galad , Círdan , and Elrond , a descendant of Tuor and Idril. Battle of Fornost Do not pursue him! He will not return to this land. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall. —Glorfindel's prophecy about the Witch-king [9] The Battle of Fornost, by Jan Pospíšil \nDuring the Battle of Fornost , Glorfindel was the major reason the evil Witch-King of Angmar was defeated. After the battle was over, and the Witch-King had fled, it was Glorfindel who predicted that no mortal man would ever destroy the Witch-king. [9] This prediction would come true a thousand years later at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields , when Éowyn of Rohan (a woman) and Meriadoc Brandybuck (a Hobbit ) destroyed the Witch-King. [10] War of the Ring Edit Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed.... it appeared that white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if though through a thin veil. — The Lord of the Rings , The Fellowship of the Ring , Flight to the Ford Glorfindel and the Nazgûl \nA thousand years later, Glorfindel was sent by Lord Elrond to search for Frodo and his companions. He pursued some of the Nazgûl and drew them away from the Ford of Bruinen . He then found and led the company for days stopping only briefly to let the Hobbits rest. When the Nazgul approached again, Glorfindel put Frodo on his white horse Asfaloth , and bade the horse take Frodo to Rivendell. Asfaloth out ran the black horses of the Nazgûl and managed to cross the Ford of Bruinen which lead to Rivendell. A severely weakened Frodo, conscious but delirious due to the wound he was carrying from the Morgul Blade, turned back to defy the Riders who pleaded for him to come with them. The Nazgul entered the shallow ford but were there un-horsed and swept away by a torrent of enchanted water which guarded the entrance to Imladris charged with the power of the Half-elven and indeed by Gandalf the Grey . [11] He later led the injured Frodo and the rest of the company safely to Rivendell. \nAt the Council of Elrond , Glorfindel sat in a position of honour alongside Elrond and Gandalf. He suggested that the One Ring should be either sent to Tom Bombadil and cast into the depths of the Sea , but Gandalf believed that the One may resurface on land after a hundred or thousand years. He was briefly considered to be a member of the Fellowship of the Ring , but was later ruled out: his power would be of no use in a mission of secrecy to Mordor. [12] After the War Edit \nAfter the Ring's destruction, Glorfindel, along with Erestor and the sons of Elrond, witnessed the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen. [13] His ultimate fate is not known, but it is reasonable to assume that he eventually sailed to Valinor with the rest of his kin. Character Glorfindel, by Magali Villenueve \nGlorfindel was known for his golden hair, which at some point, was described to be yellow. He was an elf of great bodily and spiritual structure, wisdom, and bravery. The Gondolindrim loved him dearly and wept upon witnessing his passing at Cirith Thoronath. [2] He was a capable leader, as seen when he led his House during the Fall, and loyal to his King and brothers-in-arms. He was very courageous and mindful of the refugees as they escaped. He chose to protect all the escaping Gondolindrim (especially Tuor and Idirl), though he \"would have defended them even had they been fugitives of any rank\". [8] He displayed more of his power and courage when he faced against the Nine Riders to save Frodo, and when he participated in the Council of Elrond. Powers Edit \nGlorfindel was a very capable fighter, with great endurance; he fought for hours during the Fall of Gondolin and managed to face against a Balrog on his own. [2] \nAfter his re-embodiment, Manwë had given Glorfindel powers nearly equal to the Maiar 's, to help him in his missions in Middle-earth. [8] He was considered one of the most powerful elves from Rivendell, given by his powerful and almost \"angelic\" presence, which had made the Black Riders flee many times. [9] He also had medicinal knowledge, as seen when he tends to Frodo's wounds. [11] Etymology Edit \nHis original name is said to have been Laurefindil , which is the Quenya for \"Golden-haired\", from laurë (\"golden\") and findilë (\"head of hair\"). [14] Glorfindel is simply the Sindarin translation of Laurefindil, from glaur (\"golden\") and fîn or find (\"lock of hair\"). [15] [16] Parentage Edit \nGlorfindel was said to be descended from a house of princes and one of the noble elves in Gondolin. Due to his golden hair, he might be descended from a Ñoldorin - Vanyarin intermarriage, like Finrod and Galadriel . His loyalty and following Turgon also indicated that he could be one of Turgon's kin, despite Turgon and the House of Fingolfin having dark hair. In The Complete Guide to Middle-earth , it is suggested that Glorfindel is a member of the House of Finarfin . [17] Controversy Edit \nIn Tolkien's early drafts, there were two Glorfindels: a Glorfindel of Gondolin and a Glorfindel of Rivendell. These two were initially thought to be different individuals. While writing The Lord of the Rings , Tolkien borrowed a name from one of the earlier elves. As the legendarium grew more diverse, however, Tolkien decided that an elf who had fought in many wars might be a good companion for Gandalf. He explained in The Last Writings that the Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rivendell are one and the same: He then became again a living incarnate person, but was permitted to dwell in the Blessed Realm; for he had regained the primitive innocence and grace of the Eldar. For long years he remained in Valinor, in reunion with the Eldar who had not rebelled, and in the companionship of the Maiar. To these he had now become almost an equal, for though he was an incarnate (to whom a bodily form not made or chosen by himself was necessary) his spiritual power had been greatly enhanced by his self-sacrifice. — The History of Middle-earth , The Last Writings , Glorfindel Other versions of the legendarium Edit \nUpon deciding Glorfindel's return to Middle-earth, Tolkien came up with three options: SA 1200 (during Annatar's appearance in Númenor ), SA 1600 (the completion of Barad-dûr ), or TA 1000 (with the five Istari ). Although all were probably, Tolkien favoured the SA 1600 as Glorfindel's return. [8] \nDuring the first draft of The Council of Elrond , Glorfindel was among of what was to become the Fellowship of the Ring, along with Durin son of Balin (who later became Gimli son of Gloin) and Trotter (later named Strider or Aragorn ).
