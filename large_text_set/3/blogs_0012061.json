This would not only keep cold air in place in New England and the mid-Atlantic but could also drive a wedge of cold air into the Piedmont areas of the South. \n\"The latest trends in the long-range weather pattern suggest that a rather swift warmup may take place in the Northeastern states,\" according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity. \nEven if cold air leaves the region swiftly late next week, a few pockets of cold air may remain long enough to allow a brief period of ice and/or snow. The greatest chance of snow and ice on the front end of the storm is in northern New England and the upper Great Lakes. \nThere is a possibility that snow could fall as far south as the central Appalachians and part of the mid-Atlantic. \nRegardless, it appears that a dynamic storm will take shape over the Central states, which could unleash severe weather for parts of the Plains, Mississippi Valley and the South next week. \nWith 2-3 feet of snow on the ground in parts of the Northeast, the threat for rain along with the warm air could lead to possible flooding. \nWidespread flooding problems will be avoided as long as the storm weakens before reaching the Northeast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T19:58:22.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
