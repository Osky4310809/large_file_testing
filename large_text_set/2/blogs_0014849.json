Their success has been built on a core of young and emerging talent, first and foremost of whom is Franck Kessié, who’s been heavily linked with Chelsea, Roma, and many others. Some have even claimed that he’s already agreed to join Roma, leaving all other suitors looking at other targets. But there are plenty of other players to poach from La Dea as well, including right wing-back Andrea Conti, who scored the only goal in a 1-0 win over Crotone on Saturday. With Chelsea scouts in attendance, La Gazzetta dello Sport surmise that they were impressed enough by the 22-year-old to recommend making a bid for him. Atalanta's initial asking price for Conti would be €15 million, according to the report, but with the right back signed through 2021, Atalanta have plenty of leverage and are in no hurry to sell. Still, transfer rumors have been created from less, and this isn’t the first time Conti’s name has been brought up. One to watch for then in the next transfer window.
