A post shared by Kane (@freddiegibbs) on Mar 6, 2017 at 9:44am PST \n“The Return” is also the name of a track from Danny Brown’s Old album that featured Gibbs. \nThis is Gibbs’ first Instagram post in 22 weeks as his last upload to the social media site was him celebrating his freedom with his daughter.
