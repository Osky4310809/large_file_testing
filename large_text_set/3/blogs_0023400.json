If you’re sick with a cold or flu—or just kicking one—you can likely blame acute laryngitis for your temporary hoarseness. The bugs can migrate to your vocal cords, causing swelling that alters the way they vibrate, making you sound deeper and huskier, Dr. Johns says. \nBut if your voice grows gravelly the day after your team blows the playoffs or you sang karaoke, it’s probably due to vocal overuse or abuse. \nOn any given day, your vocal cords collide millions of times, Dr. Johns says. When you yell, scream, or sing without proper training, they do so more forcefully, producing shearing forces and trauma that leave the delicate tissue of your vocal cords torn or swollen. Unnecessary sounds—say, grunting at the gym or clearing your throat—can add to the damage. \nWhat to do about your voice change: Hoarseness from illness or overuse usually resolves within a few days, but while you’re still coughing and croaking, the tissues in your larynx are prone to further injury. So even if you feel better physically after an illness, rest vocally until you sound better too, or you risk prolonging the problem, Hunter says. \nRelated: 9 Reasons Your Throat Is Sore \nThat means stop screaming at your TV, obviously. But you might also be straining your voice in some surprising ways. For instance, using your phone while driving—raising your voice over the din of highway noise— is a subtle but significant source of vocal strain, Emerich says. Just think about how much you have to turn up the radio when you speed up: That’s how much louder you’re talking, often without realizing it. \nIf your work requires you to yell frequently—say, you’re a punk-rock singer, third-grade teacher, or spin instructor—consider investing in vocal training. Learning to use your voice properly can reduce your risk of short- and long-term damage and also make you more effective at your job, Dr. Johns says. 5/6 Getty Images Voice change #5: Your voice is raspy for more than a couple weeks. In addition to short-term swelling, viruses and vocal overuse can also contribute to problems like lesions, cysts, nodules, and scarring that usually don’t away on their own. \nHuman papillomavirus—the bug linked to genital warts—also can cause growths in the vocal cords that create a lasting raspiness, Dr. Johns says. \nRelated: 4 STDs You Might Already Have \nThough it’s probably the least common cause of vocal changes, laryngeal cancer often has no signs except for an increasingly raspy voice, Dr. Johns says. (The disease strikes about 10,000 U.S. men per year, compared to more than 222,000 with lung cancer and 161,000 with prostate cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.) \nLasting hoarseness—say, that persists for more than a couple weeks without other cold-like symptoms—may also occur because tumors in your lungs, thyroid, or chest are pressing on the nerve that controls your larynx, Emerich says. \nRelated: 10 Cancer Signs You Should Never Ignore \nThen there’s acid reflux disease, in which stomach fluids back up into your esophagus. This can also damage your larynx and cause a croaky sound, Emerich says. However, it’s rare for vocal changes to be the only sign—hoarseness due to reflux is usually accompanied some combination of heartburn, throat irritation and clearing, or a sense of post-nasal drip, Dr. Johns says. \nWhat to do about your voice change : Any hoarseness that lasts longer than two weeks should be evaluated by a laryngologist—a throat doctor—preferably one with special vocal training. You can see your primary doctor first, but you really should push for a referral, especially if he or she just writes you out a prescription for acid-reducing medication, Dr. Johns says. \nThe specialist will first check for serious conditions like cancer, usually treated with surgery or chemotherapy. While these therapies cause further damage to the vocal folds, new technologies and treatments can go a long way toward restoring speech one you’re cancer-free, Emerich says. \nFor benign vocal conditions, speech therapy, surgery, laser therapy, or an injection of collagen or stem cells to rebuild the structure of the vocal cords may help. In most cases, your voice can be restored, Dr. Johns says. 6/6 Getty Images Voice change #6. You sound breathy, strained, or tight. Persistent vocal changes other than hoarseness often point to a neurologic cause. Muscle spasms in the larynx—a condition called dystonia—make your voice seem tight and strangled, with frequent breaks in pitch, Dr. Johns says. \nOne or both vocal cords can become paralyzed due to injury, tumors in the thyroid or chest, stroke, or a mysterious virus, he notes. When this happens, you might sound monotone, quiet, or only be able to utter a second or two of speech. Often, you’ll have trouble swallowing or breathing too, and make choke or cough while trying to eat. \nAnd Parkinson’s disease, a degenerative condition affecting nerve cells in the brain, causes difficulty moving muscles throughout the body—including in the larynx, mouth, and face. People with the condition often have soft, slurred, or flat-sounding speech. \nWhat to do about your voice change: See a doctor—again, preferably a laryngologist—for any unexplained changes to your voice that don’t go away after a couple of weeks. He or she will put you through a voice evaluation to test your loudness, pitch, strength, and endurance. \nThen, you might undergo what’s called video stroboscopy, where the doctor uses a strobe light—the same thing that freeze-frames your dance moves at the club—to watch your vocal cords in action. \nThe treatment for these issues depends on the cause. Parkinson’s disease is usually managed with medications, while injections or surgery may ease paralysis and dystonia. Even if your voice can’t be completely fixed, assistive technologies and physical therapy can help you function better with what remains, Dr. Johns says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:10:50.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
