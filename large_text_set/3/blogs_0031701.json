Ryan, a veteran reporter, was told by Sean Spicer to stop shaking her head as he answered a question. Elsewhere, Joe Walsh was misinterpreting a statement from Angela Rye and attacking her on Twitter for it, so it was a banner day for public, condescending interactions between white men and black women. \nThe high volume of social media reactions to all three of those incidents is likely what prompted the addition of the topic to Clinton’s address. Note that — as highlighted in the remarks — in the case of Ryan and Waters (and, indeed, Rye), the women were just doing their jobs before being scorned for it. Given that the speech was one for the Professional Businesswomen of California, the addition makes sense. \n[image: screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
