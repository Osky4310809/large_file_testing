According to Africa News , Maliango will be sharing his sentence with his brothers, Lucas Mathayo Malyango and Abdallah Ally Chaoga, who aided at least 15 trafficking syndicates. \nMaliango, who you may recognize as one of the criminals highlighted the in the 2016 Netflix documentary, The Ivory Game , was considered east Africa’s biggest ivory poacher as well as the head of several major poaching networks. One of the networks he was involved in supplied China’s “Ivory Queen,”Yang Fenlan. Fenlan is currently on trial in Tanzania for trafficking at least 700 elephant tusks between 2000 and 2014. \nWhile Maliango’s arrest and his subsequent prison sentence is a major victory for elephants, 12 years is not nearly enough for the hundreds of lives he has taken. Although the trade and sale of ivory obtained after 1989 is illegal, thanks to the international ivory ban, there are many loopholes that allow the trade to continue on the black market. Sadly, as a result, Africa has lost nearly 60 percent of its elephant population and around 100 elephants are killed every day for their tusks. \nElephants are highly intelligent, emotional beings who are similar to us in so many ways. They love, they grieve , and they share a bond with members of their herd that is perhaps closer than many of us ever will be with our friends and family. The ivory trade destroys families and leaves behind countless orphaned calves who have no hope of survival without human intervention. \nWhile we are happy to see Maliango go to prison, a 12-year sentence is not nearly enough for the man and his brother who are responsible for so many broken families.
