He used GCHQ.” GCHQ is the acronym for British intelligence. \nThat report got the attention, first in the White House press briefing on Thursday and then was citied by Pres. Trump on Friday during his news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \n“All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television,” Trump said. “I didn’t make an opinion on it. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox.” \nThe GCHQ called Napolitano’s commentary “utterly ridiculous.” \nNot long after Trump made those comments, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith said the news side of Fox News “cannot confirm Judge Napolitano’s commentary.” \nA Fox News insider we talked to last week expected Napolitano to be back on the air today as part of the coverage of the Supreme Court nomination hearing for Judge Neil Gorsuch .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T08:24:43.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
