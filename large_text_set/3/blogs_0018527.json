WrestleMania 33 matches \nUniversal Championship -- Goldberg (c) vs. Brock Lesnar: As expected, Goldberg beat Kevin Owens at Fastlane for the title, putting this clash between two part-time superstars with a combined age of 89 as the main event for WWE’s signature show each year. \nWWE Championship -- Bray Wyatt (c) vs. Randy Orton: This is now officially official after Orton beat AJ Styles on SmackDown to become the No. 1 contender he already was after winning the Royal Rumble. WWE felt the need to take the long road to get here despite Orton earning the shot over a month ago, but it still worked its way out. \nRaw Women’s Championship -- Bayley (c) vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Sasha Banks vs. Nia Jax: As predicted in this space, WWE has now made this a Fatal 4Way match with Jax defeating Bayley in a no disqualification match on Raw to earn a spot. \nThe Undertaker vs. Roman Reigns: First teased in the Royal Rumble, Taker-Reigns was setup perfectly by WWE after Reigns dispatched Braun Strowman at Fastlane. The Deadman makes sense as the next obstacle for him to overcome. Strowman is still lingering around this feud. \nSeth Rollins vs. Triple H: Not yet “official,” this remains contingent on Rollins’ health after he tore his MCL weeks ago following an attack by Samoa Joe on Raw. WWE played up the injury angle with a Triple H crutch attack on Rollins, and now Rollins will need to appear on the final Raw before WrestleMania to accept a hold harmless clause to compete. \nUnited States Championship -- Chris Jericho (c) vs. Kevin Owens: This match was a shoe-in for WrestleMania as soon as Jericho agreed on Owens’ behalf to fight Goldberg for the universal title. Glad to see the title will be on the line here and won’t be surprised if some stipulation is added before the big show. \nAJ Styles vs. Shane McMahon: Though not exactly “official,” McMahon threw down the challenge to close last Tuesday’s SmackDown. Still waiting for a stipulation to be added. \nJohn Cena & Nikki Bella vs. The Miz & Maryse: Cena won the WWE title at Royal Rumble and has now been relegated to a mixed tag match with his girlfriend against one of his oldest rivals and his wife at WrestleMania. It became official on SmackDown last week and something tells me, based on the way the angle went, we might see a proposal. \nRaw Tag Team Championship -- Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson (c) vs. Enzo Amore & Big Cass vs. Cesaro & Sheamus: The triple threat match became a head-to-head match for about three minutes on Raw before Cesaro and Sheamus earned their way back into the title match. \nSmackDown Women’s Championship -- Alexa Bliss (c) vs. Entire SmackDown roster: Rather than go one-on-one with Becky Lynch, Bliss will face “every available woman on the SmackDown roster,” likely meaning everyone except Nikki Bella, Maryse and possibly Naomi, depending on her health. \nCruiserweight Championship -- Neville (c) vs. Austin Airies: After taking the No. 1 contender’s match on 205 Live last week, Airies will fight Neville for the strap. \nAndre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal: Mojo Rawley, Apollo Crews, Big Show and Curt Hawkins have been announced as participants. Thrilling. Will Shaquille O’Neal make an appearance for a second-straight year? WrestleMania 33 predictions \nIntercontinental Championship -- Dean Ambrose (c) vs. Baron Corbin (Falls Count Anywhere): This should come to a head Tuesday on SmackDown. The title is currently being wasted on Ambrose. Corbin made his presence known one year ago at WrestleMania and could walk out of Orlando with one of the company’s most prestigious titles. I also expect a stipulation to be added. Believe it or not, the IC title could be contested on the kickoff show. \nSmackDown Tag Team Championship -- American Alpha (c) vs. The Usos: The real build for this match started weeks ago and then took a week off before The Usos beat Alpha clean last Tuesday. \nSamoa Joe vs. Sami Zayn: Would be a quality kickoff show match. WrestleMania 33 tickets \nUnsurprisingly, WrestleMania 33 is the best-selling wrestling event thus far in 2017 with a median ticket price of $300. Tickets have been purchased for as much as $10,675, though you can get in the door for much less than that. With NXT TakeOver set to go down that Saturday, the Hall of Fame scheduled for Friday and WrestlemMania Axxess also going down in Orlando, Florida, there’s plenty of events to enjoy should you head over. \nCheck out TicketCity.com for some of the best prices on tickets to WrestleMania 33 and its surrounding events this April.
