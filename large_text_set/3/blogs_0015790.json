offered a club director role at his beloved Roma, with playing future uncertain \nRoma's president James Pallotta has offered Totti a six-year contract as a club director, after manager Luciano Spalletti threatened to resign if the 40-year-old was not retained  42   Football Totti could be set with a move upstairs at AS Roma Getty \nAS Roma legend Francesco Totti, who has played at the Stadio Olimpico for the last 28 years, has been offered a six-year director contract by the club president James Pallotta. \nHowever, Pallotta has refused to be drawn on whether or not Totti will play on for a 26 th full season. \nTotti, who turns 41 in September, was offered a one-year contract extension last season on account of his impressive performances at the end of the season, which included a pivotal free-kick goal in the 3-2 comeback win over Genoa . \nBut this season he has been limited to a role on the periphery of the first-team and has managed to score only two Serie A goals this campaign: his lowest goal return since the 1995/96 season. Roma first joined Roma aged just 13 ( Getty ) \n\"We've not spoken [about his playing future] but Francesco has a six-year contract as a director,\" Pallotta was quoted as saying by Gazzetta dello Sport after Roma’s 3-1 win against Sassuolo. \n\"Our objective now is to qualify for the Champions League, even if the season's not over yet because [league leaders] Juve still have to play Napoli so I'm hoping for a draw in that game. \n\"We've just got to think about this now, not about contracts. I'm confident we can finish second. The Champions League is where this club belong. We've slowed down a bit, but I think we'll pick up the pace again towards the end.\" Most expensive players by age Most expensive players by age 1/27 14 years old: Sheyi Ojo, MK Dons – Liverpool, 2011. £2.13m. \nLiverpool beat off competition from practically every European superclub to land the signing of 14-year old wonderkid Ojo, from MK Dons’ academy. Encouraging loan spells at Wigan and Wolves followed, with the winger graduating to Liverpool’s first-team squad last season. Liverpool FC via Getty Images 2/27 15 years old: Fran Merida, Barcelona – Arsenal, 2005. £2.72m. \nFrightened by the number of prodigiously talented young players being signed by Barcelona, Merida’s parents encouraged a move to Arsenal. But Merida struggled to acclimatise himself in England, making just six league appearances before returning home. Recently signed from second-tier Huesca by La Liga outfit Osasuna. AFP/Getty Images 3/27 16 years old: Theo Walcott, Southampton – Arsenal, 2006. £8.93m. \nA precocious talent: Nike agreed to sponsor Walcott when he was just 14-years old. Arsenal splashed the cash after an impressive debut season with Southampton in the Championship, and they have been rewarded with twelve seasons worth of hard-work and underwhelming finishing. AFP/Getty Images 4/27 17 years old: Alexandre Pato, Internacional – AC Milan, 2007. £8.93m. \nPato began life at the San Siro encouragingly, scoring 18 goals in his debut season and winning both the Golden Boy and Serie A Young Footballer of the Year awards. But from then on his form fluctuated, and he acquired an unwanted playboy reputation after well-publicized trysts with Barbara Berlusconi, a director at the club and daughter of former Italian president Silvio. Now starring for Tianjin Quanjian. AFP/Getty Images 5/27 18 years old: Luke Shaw, Southampton – Man Utd, 2014. £31.88m. \nShaw became the most expensive teenager in football when he left Southampton for Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United. His time at Old Trafford didn’t get off to a great start: the Dutchman promptly accused him of not being fit enough. Injury has dogged his time at the club, and recent reports suggest he could soon be moved on. AFP/Getty Images 6/27 19 years old: Anthony Martial, Monaco – Man Utd, 2015. £42.5m. \nAnother one of Louis van Gaal’s excessively expensive teenage signings. Has generally fared better than Shaw, and made a blistering start to his United career when he scored on his debut before winning the Premier League Player of the Month award in his first month in English football. But has struggled for game time under Jose Mourinho. AFP/Getty Images 7/27 20 years old: Raheem Sterling, Liverpool – Man City, 2015. £53.13m. \nDeserted Liverpool for Manchester at the end of one of the most protracted transfer sagas of recent time, after a length and tortuous dispute over a new contract. Has enjoyed an encouraging start to his City career and has been a regular under Pep Guardiola. AFP/Getty Images 8/27 21 years old: Neymar, Santos – Barcelona. 2013. £74.97m. \nThe exact sum of Neymar’s transfer from Santos to Barcelona is one of the most controversial subjects in football, but the following is without doubt: Neymar was the most expensive 21-year old player in the history of the game. An undoubted success at Barca, forming a formidable attacking triumvirate alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Getty Images 9/27 22 years old: John Stones, Everton – Man City, 2016. £47.26m. \nEyebrows were raised when Manchester City made John Stones the second most expensive defender of all-time (behind David Luiz). It was hoped that Pep Guardiola would be able to get the best out of a talented but frustratingly erratic young talent, but the costly mistakes have unfortunately yet to be eradicated. Getty Images 10/27 23 years old: Paul Pogba, Juventus – Man Utd, 2016. £89.25m. \nManchester United infamously allowed Paul Pogba to leave for Juventus for a pittance, and then had to spend a world-record fee to get him back. It wasn’t the shrewdest of business decisions, but it made sense where the football was concerned: Pogba has scored four goals since returning and has been instrumental in United’s recent improvement. Man Utd via Getty Images 11/27 24 years old: Gareth Bale, Tottenham – Real Madrid, 2013. £85.85m. \nSurpassed Cristiano Ronaldo as the most expensive player in the world when he joined Real Madrid in 2013. He may not quite have reached the same formidable heights as CR7, but he has played an invaluable role in two Champions League winning campaigns. AFP/Getty Images 12/27 25 years old: Oscar, Chelsea – Shanghai SIPG, 2017. £51m. \nJoined Chelsea in 2012 as the next Kaka. Left this year as the next Paulinho. Showed flashes of his talent at Stamford Bridge – and started 28 games during Chelsea’s title-winning 2014/15 campaign – but ultimately failed to impress Antonio Conte. Worth far less than the £51m he was sold for. AFP/Getty Images 13/27 26 years old: Angel di Maria, Real Madrid – Man Utd, 2014. £63.75m. \nFurther irrefutable evidence that Louis van Gaal doesn’t know how to spend large sums of money. Di Maria joined from Real Madrid for a club record fee, but a promising start to Old Trafford quickly faded, and United were more than fortunate to recoup £44m from the equally profligate PSG. AFP/Getty Images 14/27 27 years old: Luis Suarez, Liverpool – Barcelona, 2014. £69.46m. \nThe Uruguayan came so very close to single-handedly winning Liverpool the Premier League title in 2014, before quitting and joining Barcelona. Things didn’t get off to the best of starts when he was suspended for the start of the season after biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, but 40 goals in just 35 La Liga matches in his second season meant his occasional bouts of ill-discipline was quickly forgotten. AFP/Getty Images 15/27 28 years old: Gonzalo Higuain, Napoli – Juventus, 2016. £76.5m. \nIn the 2015/16 season the irrepressible Higuain scored an incredible 36 goals to claim the Capocannoniere and equal Gino Rossetti's 87-year-old record for goals in an Italian top-flight season. His reward was a £76.5m move to Juventus, where he has unsurprisingly proved an instant success. AFP/Getty Images 16/27 29 years old: Zinedine Zidane, Juventus – Real Madrid, 2001. £62.48m. \nOne of the best players of all-time, and for eight years, the most expensive player in the history of the game. Joined Real in the twilight of his career but still managed to fit in five highly successful seasons. Now manages the club he retired at. AFP/Getty Images 17/27 30 years old: Samuel Eto’o, Inter – Anzhi Makhachkala, 2011. £22.95m. \nFC Anzhi Makhachkala perhaps wasn’t the natural next stop on a glittering football C.V. that included Real Madrid, Barcelona and Inter Milan, but there was little chance Inter were going to turn down such a large fee for a 30-year old. Spells at Chelsea and Everton followed. Now interim player-manager at Turkish outfit Antalyaspor. AFP/Getty Images 18/27 31 years old: Gabriel Batistuta, Fiorentina – Roma, 2000. £27.63m. \nBatistuta hit the ground running when he first signed for Roma, managing 20 goals in 28 Serie A games, only six less than golden boot winner Hernan Crespo. But his advancing years soon caught up with him: The Argentine scored only 10 more league goals for the club over the next two league seasons. 19/27 32 years old: Shay Given, Newcastle – Man City, 2009. £7.65m. \nGiven was regarded as one of the finest goalkeepers in the Premier League when he quit struggling Newcastle for nouveau riche Manchester City in 2008. Immediately displaced a junior Joe Hart – who was banished on loan to Birmingham – before the rookie was to replace him in the 2010/11 season. Given moved on to Aston Villa, for £3.5m. AFP/Getty Images 20/27 33 years old: Claudio Bravo, Barcelona – Man City, 2016. £15.3m. \nThe less said about this one the better. Another case of Manchester City signing a goalkeeping in his twilight years, booting Joe Hart out on loan, and then wishing they could take him back. Bravo arrived for big money but his signing has proved an unmitigated disaster. Recently he has been benched in favour of Willy Caballero. AFP/Getty Images 21/27 34 years old: Lilian Thuram, Juventus – Barcelona, 2006. £4.25m. \nThe most capped player in the history of the France national team, who enjoyed long and successful spells at Monaco, Parma and Juventus. Barca took advantage of the infamous Calciopoli scandal to sign Thuram for a discount price when Juventus dropped into Serie B, but the defender was forced into an early retirement after only two seasons at the club, after he was diagnosed with a heart defect. AFP/Getty Images 22/27 35 years old: Ze Roberto, Bayern Munich – Hamburg, 2009. £3.4m. \nMany thought Ze Roberto would see out his career at Hamburg, after the German club paid Bayern £3.4m for the then 35-year old. How wrong they were. He spent two successful seasons at the club only to depart for Qatari club Al-Gharafa, following that up with stints at Grêmio and Palmeiras. He’s still playing. He’s 43 this July. He signed a contract extension in December. Bongarts/Getty Images 23/27 36 years old: David James, Man City – Portsmouth, 2006. £1.45m. \nWhen 36-year old David James hurriedly left Manchester City for personal reasons in 2006, little did he know how successful his next move was to prove. James kept clean sheets in his first five appearances for Portsmouth, setting the tone for a fine four seasons on the south coast, which included an FA Cup win and an appearance in the Uefa Cup group stage. AFP/Getty Images 24/27 37 years old: Brad Friedel, Blackburn Rovers – Aston Villa, 2008. £2.13m. \nFriedel left Blackburn just two appearances short of Terry Gennoe's club record of 289 for a goalkeeper. Villa beat off interest from Manchester City for his signature, and the American was ever present for the next three seasons. He would move once again before his retirement, to Tottenham Hotspur. Now the head coach of USA Under-19s. Getty Images 25/27 38 years old: Marko Simeunovic, AEL Limassol – Interblock, 2006. £765k. \nThe Slovenian goalkeeper enjoyed a storied career across eastern Europe and represented Slovenia at Euro 2000 and the 2002 World Cup before he became the most expensive 38-year-old player of all time upon signing for the appealingly named Interblock. 26/27 39 years old: Craig Brewster, Inverness – Dundee Utd, 2006. £340k. \nThis is possibly the only instance of humble Dundee United featuring on a list of the most expensive transfers in football. Craig Brewster returned to the club as player-manager in January 2006, although the move wasn’t a successful one. The Tangerines went unbeaten for their first three matches, but then went on to win only one match for the remainder of the season. Brewster would cling on until October. Getty Images 27/27 40 years old: Bogdan Stelea, Unirea Urziceni – Brasov, 2008. £85k. \nBrasov forked out £85k for 40-year old Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea, but the former Salamanca number one was to make only 23 appearances before calling it a day. He immediately embarked on a managerial career, spending time at Astra Ploiești and Viitorul Constanța. \nTotti is a revered figure in the city of Rome and, should he signal an intention to continue playing, it is highly unlikely the club will be able to deny offering him a further extension. \nRoma’s coach, Luciano Spalletti, has certainly thrown his support behind the 40-year-old playmaker and in February he suggested he would resign in protest if Totti was not retained by the club. \n\"Don't ask me about how well my team is doing, ask me about Totti,\" he said at a news conference after Roma's win against Torino, in which Totti had featured. \n\"It is only right that his contract is renewed. Totti doesn't have a contract with this club, he has a pact of love with this city, and this is something that has to continue. \n\"I will go even further: if they send him away at the end of the season then I am not staying, not even if I win the Treble. I don't want him to retire while I am the coach.\" Totti in 2007, with the coveted Capocannoniere award for the best player in Serie A ( Getty ) \nHowever, Pallotta – a billionaire American businessman who became president of the club in 2012 – has said he is eager for Spalletti to stay, which means Totti’s future at the club looks assured. \n“I want [Spalletti] to stay, but it is up to him to decide. It's not down to me,” Pallotta commented recently. More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:56:14.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
