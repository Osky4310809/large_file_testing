As thousands of protesters took to the streets and major airports throughout the country to stand up against the Muslim ban, Teigen tweeted, \nDonald Trump is an unwell, evil human being. To the core. \nAs expected, the vile haters flooded in Chrissy’s Twitter mentions like a swarm of cockroaches for simply expressing herself. The tweet racked up over 53,000 retweets and 153,000 likes, what did you expect?! Here’s Chrissy Teigen’s tweet calling out President Trump for his controversial executive orders to ban immigrants from select countries on Saturday. Donald Trump is an unwell, evil human being. To the core. \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 28, 2017 When one hater challenged Teigen calling her “just another celebrity that doesn’t live in the real world,” she responded perfectly. @chrissyteigen Just another celebrity that doesn't live in the real World and has no idea what the hell is going on. \n— Chris Sussdorf (@chrissussdorf) January 28, 2017 As always, she had the last word. Sarcasm did the trick. Yeah I am watching from a fucking throne in space. https://t.co/FVUlhHijFf \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 28, 2017 Obviously, she received way more hate than that. It began with the generalization of liberals (typical). @chrissyteigen Liberals are hilarious \n— Josh Richardson (@j_c_richa) January 28, 2017 They just don’t see eye-to-eye. @chrissyteigen Horrible thing to say of any Human being, especially when it's unfounded and untrue.
