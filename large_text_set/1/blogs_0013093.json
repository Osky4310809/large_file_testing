I can understand why President-Elect Donald Trump would be upset about that,\" Tapper said. JAKE TAPPER, CNN: Well, there are two categories of news. Let me take on the first one that has to do with us. CNN. At the beginning of the press conference Sean Spicer, who is going to be the White House press secretary, suggested that both BuzzFeed and CNN publish this dossier full of uncorroborated rumors. that's not true. That's false. CNN never did that. We never provided even one detail from that dossier except this morning when I said that there was reason to believe that one detail that had been out there because of buzz feed was false involving Trump's attorney Michael Cohen. That conflation whether it's because Sean Spicer misunderstood or some other reason, that's not true... When Mr. Trump went after our own Jim Acosta saying he is fake news and he isn't going to call for him, what I suspect we are seeing here is an attempt to discredit legitimate, responsible attempts to report on this incoming administration with irresponsible journalism that hurts us all and the media going forward should keep that in mind. That's one, just to get it out of the way. WOLF BLITZER, CNN:You're referring specifically to BuzzFeed. TAPPER: It's irresponsible to put uncorroborated information on the internet. I can understand why President-Elect Donald Trump would be upset about that. I would be upset about it too. It's why we did not publish it and why we did not detail any specifics from it because it was uncorroborated and that's not what we do. We are in the business of sussing out what is true and what is false.
