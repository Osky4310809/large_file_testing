Worldwide sales of the Obamas’ books are expected to be “substantial.” \nAs expected, the Obamas will also donate a generous portion of the profit generated from the sales to a number of charity organizations including the Obama Foundation. \nChief Executive of Penguin Random House, Markus Dohle, released a statement regarding the new deal, saying, \nWe are absolutely thrilled to continue our publishing partnership with President and Mrs. Obama. With their words and their leadership, they changed the world, and every day, with the books we publish at Penguin Random House, we strive to do the same. Now, we are very much looking forward to working together with President and Mrs. Obama to make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance. \nI’m not too sure about you, but I’ve been waiting on these two memoirs for two presidential terms. If anyone has a story to tell, it’s President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. \nI do have one question, though… Is there any way we can cut Joe Biden in on the deal and get him to narrate the audiobooks?! Make it happen (please).
