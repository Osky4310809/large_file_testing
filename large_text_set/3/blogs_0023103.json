One destination domain, Trump-Email.com, stuck out because the conspiracy theory of Trump colluding with Russia was already being heavily floated by Hillary operatives and parroted by the mainstream media. \nThe malware appeared to have been connected to two Russian banks – Alfa Bank and SVB Bank, and was suggested to be proof of secretive communications, or possible illegal banking activity. \nMany believe that this spurred the Obama administration to obtain FISA permission to conduct electronic surveillance, directed at ‘the Russians’ in communication with Trump tower. \nIn other words, there is significant evidence to suggest that the CIA could have planted information as a means of deceiving the NSA into believing Trump and Russian entities were communicating. \nEven though the FBI found no evidence for any of the accusations, an investigation still appears to have been continued. The domain Trump-Email.com turned out to not even be owned by Trump. \nThe entire story has already been thoroughly debunked.
