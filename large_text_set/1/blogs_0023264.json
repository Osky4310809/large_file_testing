Unfortunately, the new material isn't George R. R. Martin 's long-awaited book. \nInstead, it's a short story from the author slated to be included in an upcoming anthology. \nSEE ALSO: George R. R. Martin hints at a 2017 'Winds of Winter' release date \nDetails as to what exactly will be addressed in the new story have yet to be revealed. All we know for now is that it is set in the Game of Thrones universe.\nHowever, even for this smattering of new George R.R. Martin material, hardcore fans will be forced to wait most of the year — until October! \nOn the book's Amazon description page , the anthology, titled Book of Swords , highlights Martin's involvement, stating: \nFifteen original tales celebrating fantasy’s golden age of sword and sorcery, including a new story from George R. R. Martin set in the world of A Game of Thrones!\nEdited by longtime Martin collaborator Gardner Dozois, the writers featured alongside Martin will, according to one author with a story in the book, include Matthew Hughes, K.J. Parker, Scott Lynch, Robin Hobb, Garth Nix, C.J. Cherryh, Elizabeth Bear, Ellen Kushner, Ken Liu, Danial Abraham, Cecelia Holland and Peter S. Beagle. \nHowever, that list was posted back in 2015, so the list of authors may have changed since then. \nSo while the new story won't bring the closure many Game of Thrones fans have been waiting for from Martin, it will serve as a sweet sip from the fountain of Martin fiction until he finally finishes his next book. \nBONUS: The 'Game of Thrones' Show Will End Before the Books", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T00:36:14.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
