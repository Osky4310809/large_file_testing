But among his list of achievements lies a lesser known app called Recently; Recently is a great little tool that allows you to customize the way your recents menu handles apps. After languishing for a while, Recently has just been updated to version 1.40 which adds support for Android Nougat .\nThat’s basically all that has been added to Recently, but the app has its fair share of dedicated fans that will be very happy to know it’s now Nougat compatible. Recently was originally introduced as a way to take control over the potentially endless list of entries in the apps overview introduced with Lollipop and continued through Marshmallow.\nSee also: 15 best root apps for Android October 26, 2016 While Google fixed some of those issues with the update to Nougat , Recently will let you maintain complete control over what is displayed there.
