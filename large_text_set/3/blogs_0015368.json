Hughes asked that the visit not be political.\nBut the visit did stir controversy from the minute Hughes announced Pence’s scheduled appearance on social media, with some parishioners voicing objections. “This is a diverse congregation, perhaps more Democrat than Republican,” said Hughes.\nThe vice president received a round of applause from the congregation when he was ushered to a front row seat by a squad of Secret Service agents soon after the musical opening of the 10 a.m. service.\nBefore summoning Pence to the stage, Hughes told the audience about the call from the Vice President’s office. “They asked if he would be welcome,” he said. “I said we’d be honored. This was not about partisan politics, but patriotism.”\nOnce on stage, Hughes asked Pence to talk about his own Christian faith before bringing up the political polarization in the country.\nOutside about 50 people gathered at the corner of Atlantic Boulevard and Lakeview Drive to protest Pence’s appearance, calling attention with signs and rainbow flags to his past opposition to same-sex marriage and gay rights.\n“He has a terrible history on women’s rights,” said Kathleen Van Schalkwyk, one of the rally organizers. “We feel the pastor made a mistake in accepting the offer that he come here. But we are protesting Mike Pence, not the church.”\n@pastordhughes on Instagram » \nBefore the service, Hughes said he did not want the Pence visit to become political.\n“Our intent is for this NOT to be a political or partisan event, but rather an opportunity to hear how a sitting Vice President integrates his personal faith with his very public calling,” Pastor Hughes wrote in his Instagram post.\nHughes said the Church by the Glades congregation is “not red or blue, not donkeys or elephants, just Jesus.”\nDebate on pastor's Facebook page after announcement that Pence will visit Church by the Glades » \nA mobile Oval Office: Mar-a-Lago readied for president's Marine One helicopter Skyler Swisher This is not just another weather chopper you’re going to start seeing in South Florida.\nMarine One, the president’s helicopter, can cruise at speeds of 150 mph to get the commander in chief to safety.\nIt flies so smoothly, it’s quiet enough inside for the president to talk in a normal tone of voice.\n...
