On Norman Lamont getting sacked \nThe Treasury has helpfully reminded me that I am not the first chancellor to announce the last spring budget. Twenty-four years ago, Norman Lamont also presented what was billed then as the last spring budget. … The then prime minister described it as the right budget, at the right time, from the right chancellor. What they failed to remind me of, Mr Speaker, was that 10 weeks later, he was sacked. Comparing Labour to a car without a driver \nHammond promised \n… £70m to keep the UK at the forefront of disruptive technology such as fire tech, robotics systems and driverless vehicles, a technology I believe the party opposite knows something about… On Jeremy Corbyn disappearing down a black hole \nA well-functioning market economy is the best way to deliver prosperity and security to working families and the litany of failed attempts at state control of industry by Labour leave no one in any doubt about that. \nExcept, apparently, the Right Honourable Gentleman opposite, who is now so far down a black hole that even Stephen Hawking has disowned him. On Britain’s troubled relationship with the EU \nOverall, public sector net borrowing as a percentage of GDP is predicted to fall from 3.8% last year to 2.6% this year. \nAnd for those who care about such things, it means we are forecast to meet our 3% EU stability and growth pact target this year for the first time in more than a decade. \nBut I won’t hold my breath, Mr Deputy Speaker, for my congratulatory letter from Jean-Claude Juncker. On being upstaged by Theresa May on International Women’s Day \nI am delighted to use the occasion of International Women’s Day to announce three additional measures. \nWell, not quite announce them, Mr Deputy Speaker, because my Right Honourable Friend the Prime Minister’s already announced two of them. \nMay replied:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:19:29.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
