For one, the schedule is ever changing, so it’s almost impossible to draft up a concrete itinerary (heads up to all you OCD planners out there). Secondly, the sheer quantity of designers showing their respective collections all at once makes it nearly impossible to attend every show, so the selection process can be quite daunting. \nThe FW17 menswear-dedicated Fashion Month recently concluded in the Big Apple, where industry folk flooded the city’s streets to soak up all the sartorial happenings taking place at breakneck speed. While we did our best to hit up as many shows as we could, some shows unfortunately didn’t make the cut (time travel sadly doesn’t exist yet). \nThe latest installment of our ongoing Under the Radar series spotlights five burgeoning designers whose collections generated a sizable amount of buzz at New York Fashion Week: Men’s this season. From ghetto-fab Louis XVI voguing gear to politically-charged repurposed sportswear, stay ahead of the game by getting to know these brands before they become huge. \nIf your label wants to be considered for future posts then, by all means, get in touch .

Dubbed “To Whom It May Concern,” the collection was defined by operatic cuts and whimsical silhouettes, drawing inspiration from ’90s hip-hop, skaters and Austrian artist Erwin Wurm. Further heightening his extravagant vision, LaRose made ample use of kinky fabrics such as PVC, metallic silver lamé and mesh, adding a fetishistic and feminine touch to his baggy “menswear” ensemble. \nKey Pieces : Invisible mesh cropped varsity with lamb fur collar, white PVC wide-leg trouser, beryl green quilted PVC bubble throw.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:48:28.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
