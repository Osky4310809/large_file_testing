American Provisions plans to bring its carefully curated farm-to-table products to a new shop in a mixed-use development near the Ashmont MBTA stop. Co-owners Matt Thayer and Andy Fadous received city approval to build out their new store within the Treadmark building, which will be situated at 1961-1981 Dorchester Avenue. The original 613 East Broadway shop has been around since 2010, and this expansion has been in the works for more than a year, Boston Magazine reported. It was first announced back in July 2016, according to the Dorchester Reporter , shortly before the official groundbreaking of the Treadmark building. At the time, Thayer said that the team had been approached about expanding to various neighborhoods, but due to the ownersâ€™ strong connections to Dorchester, they felt committed to finding a space there first. The new space will have approximately 1,500 square feet dedicated to retail, plus another 1,000 in back for a kitchen. Thayer and Fadous will seek a beer and wine license as well, to carry that portion of the business over to the new location, along with its specialty goods, sandwiches, and other prepared foods. The targeted opening for the new shop will be summer of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T08:57:30.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
