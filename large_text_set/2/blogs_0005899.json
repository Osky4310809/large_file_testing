Philstar.com/File ZAMBOANGA CITY — The military urged local officials to intensify their vigilance against bombing strikes staged by the Abu Sayyaf in Basilan. Maj. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) chief, reiterated his call following the latest bombing that hit the vehicle of Tuburan Mayor Dorie Kallahal Saturday. Kallahal survived the bombing explosion but his driver and a scout ranger trooper were injured from the blast that hit around 2:45 p.m. at Sitio Sawiti in Barangay Calut. The blast happened minutes after the first explosion occurred at the nearby village which prompted the local official and the soldiers to respond and verify the attack. Galvez said the bombing attacks was aimed at disrupting the medical services provided by the local government and the soldiers. “The local community must stay cautious and intensify its vigilance against suspicious activity because the lawless elements are just waiting for time to stage atrocities that will affect the peace initiatives of the government,” Galvez said. At least six bombings believed to be perpetrated by the Abu Sayyaf in Basilan occurred last week. The military and police authorities were not discounting the possible diversionary attack by the Abu Sayyaf Group after one of its senior leaders, Isnilon Hapilon, got injured in an airstrike launched by government forces in Butig, Lanao del Sur. The military launched the attack after Hapilon, a designated Islamic State-inspired militant group leader, was monitored in the area with the Maute group.
