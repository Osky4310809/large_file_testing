But one body-positive model shared a side-by-side beach body photo of herself that shows just how much angles, lighting, and even clothing can affect the way your body looks on camera — and how a “transformation” can take mere moments.\nSara Puhto, better known as @saggysara on Instagram , shared two snaps of herself in a bikini top and shorts taken seconds apart on a recent trip to Singapore. She did so to prove a point about how unnerving those perfectly-posed bikini beach shots can be when you’re casually scrolling through IG.\nA photo posted by Sara Puhto (@saggysara) on Jan 12, 2017 at 2:41am PST \n“The photo on the left is what I look like relaxed and not posing, basically how I look 99% of the time in a bikini! And the one on the right is how I look in good lighting, flexed and posing,” she wrote.\n“I wanted to share this because I know how it feels to go through Instagram and see photos of people looking amazing on the beach , which are usually planned and not candid, that’s why they look so good. So don’t get caught up on how they look and compare that to your everyday relaxed body.” Sound advice!\nPuhto often shares side-by-side photos like this one to shatter different body illusions. The one below demonstrates how the body changes throughout the day, especially after a big meal. 20 hour transformation photo Since it's the day after thanksgiving I thought it'd be appropriate to share this photo The first photo was taken yesterday morning after working out, the second was at night after eating a whole bunch of food with my whole tummy relaxed and the third was this morning again after working out I've posted a photo like this before but I just wanted to remind you that it's normal for your stomach to get bigger after large meals and that our bodies don't look the same throughout the day! I know I get pretty bloated looking after I eat a lot and that used to really upset me because I thought there was something wrong with me and that nobody else's tummy looked like this after eating but I realised its just not shown or talked about a lot. So I just wanted to show what my relaxed food baby tummy looks like compared to my empty, post workout tummy. I'm learning to love my body in ALL its forms, not just when it looks lean and toned because I know I don't look like that all day. It's time for me to love and appreciate the body I have and stop striving for \"perfection\" ☺️ Anyway, I hope you all had an amazing thanksgiving, got some delicious food in and spent quality time with your family and friends!! ☀️ \nA photo posted by Sara Puhto (@saggysara) on Nov 25, 2016 at 1:35am PST \nAnd this one proves that the size of your clothing has nothing to do with your health or fitness. Pants size transformation I've been asked many times in the past few days if my legs have grown bigger rather than slimmed down while working out. For me my legs and butt grow muscle the fastest, I hated this first when I started working out and my pants size got bigger. I've always had this odd idea that the smaller my clothing size the more attractive I am. (That's why in the picture on the left I'm wearing a jean size way too small for me) I think it's mostly come from magazines/Internet putting up ads along the lines of \"drop 2 jean sizes in a month with these workouts\" \"this diet will make you drop a dress size in a week\". Just absurd stuff that honestly won't work and isn't true. So when my jean size went up from gaining thigh/butt muscles, I just felt like I was doing something wrong and wasn't attractive. It took me a long time to realise that it's just the muscle and I shouldn't let some number on my clothes define how I felt about myself. I want my clothes to fit properly and not suffocate me when I sit down. It should be about feeling comfortable and confident because there is nothing wrong with having to go up a pants size. Why should a size 34 be more attractive than a size 38? As long as you are happy and healthy that's all that matters. I'm so glad I've learnt this, it took a long time but I'm finally there and it feels good not to constantly judge my own body. I felt the need to share this to show that it's normal for your booty/thighs to grow while working out, so go out and buy some amazing jeans that you look gorgeous in and wear them like the beautiful human you are!!! The sizes refer to European sizes so: European size 34 (AUS 6, US 2) European size 38 (AUS 10, US 6) Just wanted to put this here so you know what sizes I was referring to in the photo I hope you all have an absolutely amazing day and a great start to the week!! ☀️ \nA photo posted by Sara Puhto (@saggysara) on Dec 5, 2016 at 4:23am PST \nWe love Puhto’s simple-but-reassuring message and hope she continues to share photos from her self-love journey!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:20:17.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
