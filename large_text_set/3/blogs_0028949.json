It arrived with the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport , but it’s taken until now for Google to announce the update for any previous watches running Android Wear 1.0.\nA Google Community Manager has now revealed the first three watches to receive the update via the Android Wear support page and these are the Fossil Q Founder, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, and TAG Heuer Connected.\nThe Community Manager also said that the update was rolling out now over-the-air and would be on all devices by Tuesday, April 4.\nSee also: Fossil goes full-in on Android Wear, 300 connected watches planned for this year 6 days ago The update to the Fossil Q Founder is no surprise as we’d heard that this had started to receive Android Wear 2.0 two weeks ago . Around the same time, reports suggested that the Tag Heuer Connected would be updated before the end of March too.\nMeanwhile, the Huawei Watch was also expected to receive in the update in March after Huawei DE stated as much on Twitter . There was no mention of this from Google in the latest announcement, however, so we don’t know if this is still planned (it shouldn’t be far off regardless).\nWe’ve got a full list of smartwatches expected to receive the Android Wear 2.0 update but we don’t have much in the way of timelines for when it will be rolling out. Now that the floodgates have opened, we’re hoping other updates will pour in soon.\nFor everything you need to know about Android Wear 2.0 , hit the link.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:22:09.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
