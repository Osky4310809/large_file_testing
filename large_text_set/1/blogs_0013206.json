Print Charu Chowdhary   \nWhen you don’t know what’s causing a slow but sure death of your beloved phone; you got to pay some heed to how you're charging your phone, especially those who can't get over the iOS. Mostly that’s where we mess up the battery of our rather expensive mobile device, although it seems like a space you can hardly go wrong in. \nHere’s a list of things you shouldn’t do while feeding food to your phone. 1. Charging to 100% \nPlugging in your phone the whole night so you can get the coveted 100% charge does more harm than good. Short bouts of charging through the day are actually good to juice up your phone’s battery. 2. Letting it die \nExtremes of any kind is bad. So keep from letting your phone hit the ‘low battery’ warnings. It loses a little bit of life every time it hits low power mode. 3. Leaving the case on while it charges \nDo your phone a favour and undress it because it needs to release the heat while it charges. 4. Using too much of the kickass battery charging case \nIt is a Godsend when you really need charge in your phone and have forgotten to carry the charger. Attaching the battery case to your phone heats up both the battery and the phone, which can get lethal. Avoid making a regular habit of charging your phone via the case. Use power banks instead. 5. Using fake chargers \nIt’s a pain when you lose your expensive charger, but don’t take the easy way out and buy a pretty-coloured fake charger. Think long term. Fake chargers eventually kill your phone, so you might as well pay a little now and get an authentic charger, saving it in the long run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T07:00:32.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
