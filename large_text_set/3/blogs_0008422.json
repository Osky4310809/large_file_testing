Like REALLY good to be lucky. \nFor evidence of that, here in America we have people like Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton . If they had been born into different families we probably wouldn’t even know who they are and they would surely be a whole lot poorer as a result. Of course, a couple of sex tapes didn’t hurt in both of their cases, but those wouldn’t have gone viral had they not, once again, been born into the right families.\nA similar story is unfolding over in Italy with the 22-year-old granddaughter of a man named Ferruccio Lamborghini. If that names sounds familiar, that’s because it should. He is the man behind all those legendary supercars.\nHer name is Elettra Lamborghini and she’s already garnered quite a reputation for herself. Actually, her full name is Elettra Miura Lamborghini. Miura being the name of Lamborghini’s first supercar.\nNot only did she show up kind of naked to the MTV European Music Awards in 2016, she has also appeared on Super Shore , kind of an Italian version of our Jersey Shore .\nIt was there that she earned the name “The Italian Killer” because of how many fights she got into on the show.\nHowever, that was after she was already being called “The Italian Paris Hilton” for all the racy pics she had been sharing on social media combined with her wild lifestyle.\nToday we will be focusing on her social media prowess, in particular some of the crazy and sexy stuff she’s shared on Instagram.\nMeet your new crush, boys and girls… (and yes, those wild leopard spot tattoos do appear to actually be real…I think).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH/T Maxim \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T19:23:49.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
