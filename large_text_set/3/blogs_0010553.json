Cynthia Villar said. MONG PINTOLO, file photo \nMANILA, Philippines - Despite the continued crackdown on the mining sector, the country should still develop new domestic mineral processing plants, Sen. Cynthia Villar said. \n“Mining is an industry that we have to develop provided that they follow responsible mining,” Villar told reporters. \nShifting from export to processing is the government’s long-term goal to boost employment and significantly improve the mining industry’s contribution to the economy. \nThe Philippines is currently just exporting raw materials as the industry has yet to be developed. \nHowever, Environment Secretary Gina Lopez’s move to close down 23 operations, suspend five others and cancel 75 contracts is scaring industry stakeholders. \n“It’s very controversial but I don’t think they will stop mining. We just have to follow the law with regard to these industries,” Villar said.   \nThe downstream plan is similar to that of the Indonesian government’s, which requires companies to build domestic processing facilities. \nFor its part, the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines (COMP) expressed confidence the results of the review being conducted by the Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC) would counter the audit findings of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. \n“We are pinning our hope on MICC and we believe downstreaming is the way to go. Economics and the competitive and comparative advantage of trade will dictate implementation. It will be a long haul,” COMP executive vice president Nelia Halcon said in a text message. \nShe added that the establishment of processing plants could not be done in a short period of time as these need economic feasibility studies that would benefit both investors and the government. \n“This administration will lay down implementation. Downstreaming needs billions of capital and implementation will be defined by the economics of the program and an enabling investment environment even if there is political will,” Halcon said.
