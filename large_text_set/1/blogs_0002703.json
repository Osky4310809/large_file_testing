(Photo: Getty Images) More We’ve seen food brands make beauty products ; in fact, we’ve even picked up some of our makeup bag favorites at Whole Foods . And let’s not forget that the food-grade beauty trend blew up when everybody realized how much lipstick they were eating. (Remember when Gwyneth Paltrow and Jimmy Fallon ate her Goop Beauty skincare line with french fries?) But Burt’s Bees is the first beauty brand we’ve seen that’s actually making food. After 30 years of crafting natural skin care products and makeup , Burt’s Bees is expanding its line to include products that nourish the inside of the body, using the same care that goes into the company’s beloved beeswax lip balm . “Entering the functional foods space is a natural extension for us,” Jim Geikie, general manager for Burt’s Bees, told PR Newswire . “For three decades, Burt’s Bees has connected people to the beauty, wisdom and power of nature. And for just as long, we’ve held the belief that real beauty and well-being should be nourished from the inside out. We’ve been nurturing skin with nature’s most powerful ingredients. Now we’re helping to nourish the body with them.” This week, the brand released three plant-based protein powders, which are more sustainable than animal-based ones. They are non-GMO, 70 percent organic, gluten free, soy free and dairy free, and are packaged in recycled and recyclable containers. They also pack 4.5 servings of fruits and vegetables and are naturally sweetened with honey, monk fruit extract, and stevia leaf extract. “We’ve created formulas that not only enhance your daily nutrition but also support specific areas,” said Geikie. “Burt’s Bees Protein +Gut Health supports digestive health as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, and Protein +Healthy Radiance gives skin a healthy glow. Both are new benefit offerings in the category that we believe strengthens holistic beauty.” Let’s keep in touch!
