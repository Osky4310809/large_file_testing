[Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images] \nA number of Spears fans took to social media to express their excitement amid the tour rumors, speculating about the possible 2017 tour and potential dates on Twitter. \n“Is Britney actually going on tour??? I’ll do whatever it takes to see her omg,” Spears fan @marktynan_ tweeted out amid the speculation, while @Daniel_Skr wrote of Spears possible upcoming international tour, “Britney’s world tour is coming? I’ll die.” \n“So glad Britney is touring internationally this summer! It will get her ready to tour in the U.S. next year!” Britney fan @Gaga4BritBrit added, and @FeimM wrote online amid the tour speculation surrounding Spears, “Britney is really going on tour y’all… I can’t believe this is real life.” \nSpears is yet to officially comment on the rumors, but hinted last year that she was looking to get back on the road and tour again after almost exclusively performing in Las Vegas for the past four years. \n“I hope we can do some touring,” Britney told Las Vegas Sun last year when asked about a possible tour. “It’ll be fun to see my fans from overseas who haven’t been able to make it out to Las Vegas.” \nDo you think Britney Spears is about to announce a big international tour for 2017? \n[Featured Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T15:31:58.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
