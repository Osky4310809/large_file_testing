However, once his wife showed paramedics the picture she had taken, they saw that the victim was not holding a gun in the photo, WTAE reports.\n“Anytime you see something of that nature, where crucial evidence is moved, and you have inconsistent statements and discrepancies, it’s cause for concern,” Frazer Township Police Chief Terry Kuhns told WTAE.\nLater, while under questioning, Drum allegedly told officials she and her husband had fought over a burnt casserole, which led to insults and cursing, TribLive reports.\nAllegheny County Police charged Drum with criminal homicide for the death of Dennis Drum Sr., 42, and is being held without bail, TribLive reports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:49:19.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
