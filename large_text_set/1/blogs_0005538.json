SWD Under-19 folded for a mere 61 in response, Annerie Deckersen getting 36 of them. Annerie was eventually caught and bowled by Shania-Lee, who finished things off quickly by clean-bowling Miehantay Moos and Lorieta Vaaltyn in quick succession. She finished with the remarkable figures of 3-1-3-3, almost at par with teammate Katie Prior’s 4-3-2-3. \nDo note that her 289 was followed by 54 and 47 (both in T20 matches), but she was more interested in discussing the duck: “The ball rolled me out, I wanted to block but it went under my bat.” \nSimilarly, she was not satisfied with the other failure, of 4. She acknowledged that the fault was hers, for she had hit it straight to a fielder. As the world knows, South African fielders do not spill catches. \nThe 68 at the end of the sequence was curiously not enough for her to make it to the South Africa National Academy Squad. She sounded upset. Some of her competitors at the National Week had private coaches. Even diamonds need to be shaped. \nThen she asked something that took me by surprise: “Every good batsman has to get a duck sometime, right?” \nShe had not got over it yet. \nAlso Read Shania-Lee Swart slams 160, teammates manage 0 in Under-19 Girls cricket! \nI checked the sequence again. The innings immediately after that duck was 160, an innings that had made statisticians rummage through their notes and had made her famous around the world. \nHowever, she chose to remain occupied with that duck in her mind. I had to inform her that Don Bradman had got seven of them in his Test career, two of them in consecutive innings. \n“Okay, so I don’t have to feel bad.” \nIf anyone has to be worried after she scores a duck, it is probably the bowlers. Given her hunger for big scores, she will try to more than make up for her failures. \nBut was there anything before the 289? When did it all start? \nShe reeled them off excitedly, just like any other teenager would. There was that 213 not out in a T20 match ( what? )… and that 107… then that 147 in a club match… and, oh, the 19-ball fifty in a 50-over match… and that unbeaten 76 out of a team score of 99 in a school match… \nHang on, 213 in a T20 match? \nYeah, 2013: “I hit one over the fence onto a drivers bonnet… he was so angry (smiles)! His bonnet was damaged and he said the school will have to pay (smiles)! It was not my fault! It was my bat’s fault!” \nShe was 15 at this stage. Fifteen . If that is not unreal, or borderline unreal, I do not know what is. Abhishek Mukherjee is the Chief Editor at CricketCountry.
