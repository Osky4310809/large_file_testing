There's the Golden Girls series, a Suicide Squad release, and now, a venture that's sure to appeal to nostalgic Millennials everywhere. Today, Funko announced on its blog that a line of Pop! Animation figures featuring classic characters from '90s Nicktoons is on its way. The announcement was first made at the London Toy Fair. \nSo far, there are no pictures of the actual toys, but the blog did offer some illustrations to give us an idea—and they are adorable. The lineup includes CatDog, the monster gang from Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, and Tommy, Chuckie, and Reptar from Rugrats . As usual, all the designs feature giant heads and minimalistic eyes. \nFunko was vague about when we might see the real deal, but we know it will be sometime this year. In the meantime, we'll be in our pajamas eating Reptar Cereal .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T07:51:09.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
