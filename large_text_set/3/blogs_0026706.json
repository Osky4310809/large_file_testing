Image source: WPLG-TV video screen cap \nThe mom, who didn’t want her name reported, told WPLG that she quickly ran to her bedroom and grabbed her shotgun. Image source: WPLG-TV video screen cap \nVideo shows the perp finally breaking through and running into the house — but he doesn’t stick around long. \nSeconds later, he’s seen high-tailing back outside and quickly getting into a car he parked on the property’s front lawn. Image source: WPLG-TV video screen cap \nSure enough, video also captured the mother’s shotgun poking through the front entrance, sufficiently scaring the intruder. Image source: WPLG-TV video screen cap \n“He was running for his life and kept looking back, making sure I wasn’t going to shoot him in the back,” she told WPLG. \nThe mother didn’t fire her shotgun, which prompted a reporter to ask, “What stopped you from killing this guy?” \n“My kids,” she replied to the station. “Not traumatizing them, and I did have a baby.” \nPolice told WPLG the intruder got away in a stolen Mercedes-Benz, which was recovered in Miami — and he’s still on the loose. Information about the intruder can be shared with Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-8477. Image source: WPLG-TV video screen cap \n“I don’t sleep great at night,” the mom told the station of how the March 4 incident has affected her. “Any little noise I listen to, I have to constantly look at my camera or look at my window.” \nBut it’s probably best not to test this gun owner twice. \n“I will do anything to protect my family,” she told WPLG.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:30:32.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
