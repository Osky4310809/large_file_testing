rarely if ever has he taken the game by the scruff of the neck or lifted the rest of the team around him.\nOzil has reportedly angered Wenger by missing the West Brom game (Picture: Getty) Goals + assists 2016/17 Alexis Sanchez 27 Olivier Giroud 11 Theo Walcott 10 Mesut Ozil 9 Share\n\nIt’s never easy being a record signing (just ask Paul Pogba), but while the £42.5million Arsenal paid for Ozil in 2013 looked a big statement at the time, it has since been dwarfed by a rapid inflation in transfer fees (David Luiz and John Stones have since moved for more). And while Arsenal are yet to pay more than that for a player, it still seems a fairly modest fee in the modern era.\nDamningly for Ozil, that still doesn’t make him look a bargain.\nEven with a year left on his contract by the end of this season, one would imagine Ozil would still be a hugely expensive purchase for any club in terms of both transfer fee and wages. Despite being excellent in his three years at Real Madrid, that ship has surely sailed, and apart from that it seems unlikely that any club who could afford him would want him.\nWould Ozil really be a better signing than this lot (Picture: Squawka) Ozil’s sluggishness and habit of disappearing when it matters is clear for all to see, but his overall stats have also dropped hugely this season as he’s barely even doing the job asked of him anymore.\nHe may have finished with 19 assists in the Premier League last season, but he’s slumped to just four so far this year. That might be more forgivable if he made up for it with his goals, but he doesn’t – his return of five this season, combining to an overall goal contribution of nine, just doesn’t scream ‘world class attacking midfielder’.\nAs the numbers from Squawka above show, if top teams are going to fork out huge sums of cash this summer, it would surely be more wisely spent on the likes of Eden Hazard, Dele Alli, Kevin De Bruyne or Dele Alli – all younger, more consistent and more effective at their jobs.\nOzil hasn’t looked as good since leaving Real Madrid (Picture: Getty) Ozil will turn 29 next season and – last season aside – has not looked a genuinely top ‘number ten’ since he had the luxury of Cristiano Ronaldo to aim at up front; he performs well in a team perfectly set up for him, but there’s little reason for European heavyweights such as Barcelona or Bayern Munich to change the way they play for one flaky and erratic creator.\nWith his reputation, Ozil may rightly feel he could get himself a gig at a bigger club than Arsenal, but realistically he’s at the stage now where he would only match or better his current wages at a wealthy owner’s glamour project like Paris Saint-Germain or Inter Milan, or even the Chinese Super League. If he’s tempted by a return to Germany, he’s surely not heading to Bayern so would have to make do with a Borussia Dortmund, Schalke or Wolfsburg – none of whom are going to win the Bundesliga and certainly not the Champions League.\nMore: Football Confirmed: Man Utd ace seals transfer away - could leave Old Trafford next week \nSpurs and Arsenal incapable of putting pressure on Chelsea, says Blues legend \nSurprise Man Utd ace set for new deal after making huge strides under Mourinho \nArsenal's most expensive signings Mesut Ozil – £42.5million Alexis Sanchez – £35million\nShkodran Mustafi – £35million\nGranit Xhaka – £33.8million\nJose Antonio Reyes – £17.4million \nThings look bleak at Arsenal right now, but there’s the growing reality that a new manager could be coming in to turn major silverware into a more realistic prospect. Even after recent results, the top four is still in sight, meaning Ozil can continue to play at Europe’s top table next season. Even if Wenger stays, that at least means a team built around Ozil’s strengths, and a club whose philosophy dictates that they’re more willing than others to pin their hopes on Ozil and therefore pay him what he wants.\nWanting to leave Arsenal is hardly controversial at this stage – but Ozil needs to take a look at himself and accept that this is his level now. Leaving would be a cold hard dose of reality for a player who has to take as much blame as anyone for failing to lift his current club up from the level it finds itself in.\nMORE: New figures show leading Arsenal shareholders worth DOUBLE Chelsea owner Roman Abramovic \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:12:52.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
