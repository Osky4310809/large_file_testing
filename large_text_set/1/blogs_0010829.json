I was in floods of tears and couldn’t hold myself together. I know a lot of people who read it have been in pieces. \n“I mentioned it on Twitter and everyone’s said it’s a fantastic idea and that they wanted to help. \n“Some people have even said they want to give me their donations in cash at the next match.” Liverpool and Plymouth drew 0-0 on Sunday (Photo: Getty) \nThe banner is being produced by a shop on Smithdown Road and will include the words “RIP Daniel May”, You’ll Never Walk Alone and the image of a Liver Bird. \nIt will be held aloft at Liverpool FC’s FA Cup third-round replay against Plymouth Argyle at Home Park next Wednesday, January 18. \nMr Grice said the banner would cost just over £100 – and the rest of the money will be donated to Royal Surrey County hospital, where Daniel passed away. Liverpool plan to take a banner down to Plymouth for the away leg in remembrance of Kevin's son Daniel (Photo: Michael Steele/Getty Images) \nOn the fundraising page he wrote: “We are creating a banner for supporters to take to Plymouth away next week in Memory of Daniel May who passed away. \n“Banner to be held aloft by LFC fans during YNWA and during a minute of applause in the 25th minute of the game.” \nMr Grice added: “Hopefully this is a classy little touch and something we can do for the family as Liverpool supporters.” \nIn his Facebook post, Mr May said the men who helped him were “an absolute credit to Liverpool FC” and he wanted to thank them for the “care and the kind words” at his time of need.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:21:17.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
