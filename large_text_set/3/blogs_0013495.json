By: PTI | Surajkund (haryana) | Published: March 18, 2017 2:58 PM Home Minister Rajnath Singh (Reuters) \nHome Minister Rajnath Singh today made an assurance that farmers’ income will double by 2022 while terming agriculture as a sunrise sector of the 21st century with ample growth potential. \nAllaying fears that prospects of agriculture are bleak, the minister maintained that on the contrary, farmers have a bright future. \n“Our Prime Minister has already spelt out the vision of doubling farmers’ income by 2022 and we will convert that vision into reality,” Singh said while addressing a summit on agriculture organised by the Haryana government here. Also watch: \nThe minister also spoke of the challenges faced by farmers with regard to high input costs and a fair price for their produce. \nDispelling the notion that agriculture has no potential and Indian farmers have no future, Singh said: “People like me and many more believe that neither the potential for growth in agriculture has ended nor the future of farmers is bleak.” \nHe corroborated his stand by saying a lot of people around the world have started believing that farming is the only sunrise sector of the country in the 21st century, thanks to the way technology is deployed to increase output. \nDevendra Fadnavis makes a case to bring back debt-ridden farmers into credit system \nMaharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis today said he had positive discussions with the Centre over formulating a scheme to bring back farmers defaulting on loans, into the institutional credit system in such a way that investment in agriculture is not affected. \nMaking a statement in the Legislative Assembly, Fadnavis said he had assured Union Finance minister Arun Jaitley and Agriculture minister Radhamohan Singh that the state was willing to contribute its share in this scheme to help farmers. \nFadnavis said out of the 1.36 crore farmers, 31 lakh had loan dues worth Rs 30,500 crore. \n“These farmers are not eligible for fresh loans. There is a need to bring them back into the institutional credit system. But we have to give an incentive to over one crore farmers who pay their loans on time. Systems need to be created as such decisions cannot be taken overnight. \nIf farmers who pay their loan on time get a message that if loan dues are not repaid, the loan will be waived off, then the banking system will collapse,” the CM said. \n“A wrong message will be sent among agriculturists,” Fadnavis felt. \nAlso watch: \nHe said his government’s endeavour is to ensure that the farmers are not debt-ridden again. \nFadnavis also took a jibe at Opposition Congress -NCP saying, “you cannot be a messiah of farmers by raising slogans on loan waiver. The plight of farmers is because of your 15-year rule.” \nEarlier as soon as the House assembled for the day, the Opposition accompanied by Sena members came into the Well shouting slogans for loan waiver. \nSpeaker Haribhau Bagde immediately adjourned the House till the end of the Question Hour. \nLater when the House assembled, Fadnavis made his statement and appealed to the House to allow smooth presentation of the State Budget.
