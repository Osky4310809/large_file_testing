Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJose Mourinho returns to Stamford Bridge on Monday and will do so without star man Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nIbrahimovic was banned for three games for elbowing Tyrone Mings during Manchester United's 1-1 draw with Bournemouth. \nWayne Rooney and Luke Shaw come back into contention, however, as does Eric Bailly after serving a European suspension in Russia, where United emerged unscathed despite concerns over the pitch. Bastian Schweinsteiger remains a doubt with an unspecified complaint. \nMourinho admitted the trip south will be \"hard\" without his top scorer, especially considering his squad only arrived back from Russia on Friday morning. \nSpeaking ahead of the game, Mourinho said: \"We have to go to London. It’s really hard. We don’t have Zlatan, of course not, but we go with everything we have. We don’t put a [weakened] team out like some clubs sometimes - Manchester United cannot do that.

We cannot go there with a [Reserve] team, we'll try to manage it within our squad and get a good team to compete with them. \n\"Manchester United is Manchester United; it's the winner of this competition. It's not Chelsea's fault we were given this Monday match. We'll make changes, as we played on Thursday, but we cannot go to Chelsea with a [Reserve] team.\" \nChelsea head coach Antonio Conte, meanwhile, has a fully-fit squad and is considering his options for Monday's FA Cup quarter-final. \nJohn Terry has played in the three prior FA Cup rounds, but the defender's place against United is not guaranteed. \nAnd with Chelsea next in action at Stoke five days later, Conte could field his first-choice line-up against United. \nProvisional Chelsea squad: Courtois, Begovic, Fabregas, Zouma, Alonso, Kante, Hazard, Loftus-Cheek, Moses, Pedro, Costa, Matic, Willian, Batshuayi, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Chalobah, Luiz, Eduardo, Aina, Ake. \nProvisional United Squad: De Gea, Romero, O'Hara, Valencia, Jones, Rojo, Smalling, Bailly, Blind, Darmian, Shaw, Young, Carrick, Herrera, Fellaini, Schweinsteiger, Pogba, Mata, Lingard, Mkhitaryan, Martial, Rooney, Rashford.
