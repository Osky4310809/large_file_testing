This was later changed to \"River Zora\". River Zoras are water-dwelling fish monsters that shoot fireballs at Link, which can only be blocked by a Magical Shield . They dive down into the water and come back up to attack passersby. Edit \nZoras in The Adventure of Link behave much differently than other Zoras. They are land-dwelling and heavily armored, although they still attack by shooting energy balls at Link. This may be because they are actually a different type of Zora. They appear all over Eastern Hyrule; in caves, deserts, roadways, and bridges. Primarily quadrupedal, they can stand up on their hind legs to shoot at Link. Their armor is strong enough to withstand sword attacks; the Fire Spell must be used to defeat them. Even then, they are extremely tough, requiring three fire-enhanced sword attacks at Link's full strength. \nAlthough they are called Zora in the Japanese release of The Adventure of Link , they were never officially named in the North American version of the game. Edit \nZoras, called Zora's Spawn in this game, appear all over Hyrule. They act almost exactly the same as the Zoras in the original The Legend of Zelda , but have a more detailed appearance. This is the first game to feature a unique Zora, the only creature in the game to actually go by the name ' Zora ', who lives beneath a waterfall. He offers to sell Link Flippers for 500 Rupees . In BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets , he is instead called King Zora , and at certain times in a certain week, he will offer them to Link for 300 Rupees. He also gives Link the ability to use the warping Whirlpools in both the Light World and Dark World . This is the first and only game to have the enemy Zoras able to jump high in the air and walk on land and shallow water. In the Dark World, Zoras take the shape of a strange, one-eyed fish, also known as Ku . Edit \nZoras only appear as enemies, with the exception of an invisible Zora who is found in the Animal Village and is only viewable with a Magnifying Lens in the DX version . Talking to him gets the Photographer to take a picture of Link and the Zora, which is printable with the Game Boy Printer. Edit \nZoras take a drastic turn from the ones in the earlier games, in which they were called 'River Zora' or 'Zora's Spawn', depending upon the game. In those games, they were more monstrous, and breathed magic fire, while in the 3D games, they are blue and scaled, with a more gentle look, and a decidedly more amiable disposition. Zoras primarily reside in the Zora's Domain, while some may appear in Lake Hylia . They can exist both in and out of water, but they are best adapted to life in the water. There are two Zora scales obtainable in Ocarina of Time ; the Silver Scale , from the Zoras in Zora's Domain as a reward for winning the diving minigame, and the Golden Scale , a reward for catching a nine pound fish at the Fishing Pond . \nSeven years in the future in this game, the Zoras, with the recent exception of Princess Ruto, are trapped within a sheet of ice in the Ice Cavern , although King Zora XVI and the local shopkeeper can be saved with Blue Fire . They are an extremely proud race, and allow no outsiders to enter their domain unless they have some connection with Hyrule's Royal Family. Edit \nThe Zoras remain, for the most part, exactly the same as the Zoras in Ocarina of Time , except they reside in Termina . The only unique Zoras are the members of The Indigo-Go's and their manager. Most Zoras are found in the Zora Hall , located in the Great Bay . Link is also able to transform into a Zora via the Zora Mask . Interestingly, the Terminan Zoras appear to have no monarchy and apparently, no government at all, although it's possible that they have one located somewhere else in Great Bay as the only Zora building shown is Zora Hall. Edit \nIn both The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons , Zoras appear as enemies, acting exactly as past Zoras. However, there are also Zoras that are similar to the ones in Ocarina of Time in Oracle of Ages . In that game, the more gentle Zoras make a distinction between them and the monstrous Zoras, claiming that they are \"river Zoras\" as opposed to noble \"sea Zoras\". \nIn Oracle of Ages , Zoras live in an underwater city, which Link can access after he has acquired the Mermaid Suit . In Present time, King Zora has perished, and Lord Jabu-Jabu is a large fish, but without King Zora 's consent, Link cannot enter Jabu-Jabu's Belly . In the Past, the king is gravely ill, and requires a Potion in order to survive. Link can get one from Syrup , Maple or a Gasha Nut , and once the king is given it, he gets better. Link asks King Zora to allow him entrance into Jabu-Jabu to get an Essence of Time, but Jabu-Jabu is too small. However Link can go into the future, and gain access to the mature Jabu-Jabu. Zoras only appear in Oracle of Seasons through a linked game, and will give Link an item. There is also an old Zora who lives far away from the Zora City. He will give Link the Broken Sword in exchange for a Sea Ukulele. Despite being from a very aquatic and fish-like race, he has a beard and moustache. Edit \nZoras are supposedly extinct in The Wind Waker . However, according to Zelda director Eiji Aonuma , the Rito are evolutionary descendants of Zoras. This can be seen in the game by the fact that Medli is the descendant of an ancient Sage , Laruto , who is a Zora. Ritos are bird people, who gain their wings through acquiring a scale from Valoo . Another detail to support this is the Zora emblem on Medli's dress. The only actual Zora in the game is Laruto, who appears only as a ghost . Edit \nZoras appear as enemies in several stages with large bodies of water. Like their early incarnations, they stay in the water, from where they shoot fireballs at Link, and must be defeated with projectiles. In The Swamp , some Zoras hide under Lily Pads . When one of these Zoras bursts out of the water, it launches anyone on the Lily Pad, allowing access to higher or more distant areas. One Zora, who will ask Link to try to get 10 fish in his mouth, may be found in Kakariko Village . Edit \nThe Zoras once again reside in Zora's Domain. The Domain was raided by Shadow Beasts under Zant, and Queen Rutela was killed to show their power. The Domain then became frozen, blocking water from flowing down the river. Once Link and Midna arrive, they must warp a flaming boulder from Death Mountain into the center of the Domain in order to get the water to flow again and unfreeze the area. Also, the race has warriors that carry spears and wear fish-shaped helmets. \nThe prince of the Zoras, Prince Ralis , fled to Hyrule Castle Town in order to escape capture by the Beasts, and as a result of staying away from water too long, became ill. Ilia and Telma attempt to nurse him to health, but, unsuccessful, bring him to Renado in Kakariko Village with the help of Link. The spirit of Queen Rutela in response grants Link the Zora Armor so he can swim and breathe underwater. \nLater on, Link can find Zoras near Death Mountain, mostly in the hot springs. Interestingly, most of the Zora's encountered in Twilight Princess have feminine sounding vocal effects. Edit \nAs in The Wind Waker , there are no Zoras, or Rito for that matter. However, there are certain creatures called Zora Warriors , which are encountered throughout the games that have the heads of River Zoras and a body resembling a bloated Zora body. They appear to be either a cross between River Zoras and Zoras, the missing link between the two species, or simply a monster based off their design. They attack by spitting fire balls at Link, like River Zoras, but they also have swords and shields, which makes fighting them substantially harder. Link finds them in caves and sometimes on boats. There are also Zora scales and crowns in the game that Link can buy and sell. The crowns are known as Ruto Crowns and Zora Scale , two of many Treasures that Link can sell to the Treasure Teller for a varying price of Rupees. Both are said to have been worn by a princess of the Zora. This is strange, as all crowns that Link find are described in the same way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:13:59.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
