Prepare for battle in the coming months, because Valkyria Revolution is launching in the Americas on June 27 for PS4 and PS Vita! Our previous PS.Blog post covered how the game is quite literally a revolution from previous Valkyria games, but let me give you a brief refresher before you charge once more unto the breach.\nFirst things first: Valkyria Revolution is not a sequel to the Valkyria Chronicles series. “Spinoff” would be the right word. It takes place in a whole different timeline, continent, and universe than its predecessors, but familiar elements — such as the precious mineral ragnite and the legendary beings known as the Valkyria — make a return.\nInstead of a World War II influence, the game is inspired by the European industrial revolution and focuses on a war of liberation between two vastly different nations. But arguably the biggest difference is the battle system. The turn-based action has been replaced with faster-paced (but no less strategic) combat. This hybrid battle system combines the tactics of customizing squad behavior and loadouts with real-time action for some pretty intense moments on the field.\n\nBut at its core, Valkyria Revolution is a very human story about war. The small independent kingdom of Jutland is suffocating from an economic blockade sanctioned by the tyrannical Ruzi Empire, and must resort to war in order to liberate itself and the surrounding lands from the Ruzi’s imperialist conquest.\nThere’s one small problem: the Ruzi Empire have a Valkyria. You know, the living embodiment of death in demi-god form? Yeah, things aren’t going very well for the soldiers of Jutland. But that’s where the Vanargand come in. This elite team of ragnite sensitive warriors have been assembled with the sole purpose of annihilating the Ruzi’s Valkyria with extreme prejudice. Led by the consummate professional Captain Amleth Gronkaer and bolstered by the inspiring presence of Jutland’s Princess Ophelia, the Vanargand are ready to turn the tide of the war in the name of freedom. However, Amleth hides a terrible secret. Is he friend or foe to the country he has sworn to protect?\nAnd we’ve got one more thing to reveal. Loyal soldiers are always rewarded for their service, so pre-orders and limited launch copies of the physical PS4 game will come packaged as the Valkyria Revolution Vanargand Edition in the Americas. This special edition comes with a bold pin inscribed with the Vanargand’s ferocious coat of arms, a 12-track soundtrack by the extremely talented Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger, Stella Glow), and stunning outer box. Quantities are limited, so grab your copy of the Vanargand Edition on the double!\n\nValkyria Revolution will be released physically and digitally for PS4, and as a digital-only title for PS Vita.\nGodspeed, soldier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T19:12:06.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
