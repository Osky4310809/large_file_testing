When asked about the issue repeatedly, she said she would not try to “keep bits of membership”. \nBut Angus Robertson, the SNP’s Westminster leader, claimed the Prime Minister had used “a lot of words to say nothing at all” and offered no clarity on her policy on Brexit. \nMs Sturgeon told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme her message to the Prime Minister was “don’t disregard Scotland because it is not acceptable to do so”. Watch | Theresa May not muddled over Brexit plans 02:47 \nS he added: “You said during the independence referendum that Scotland was an equal part in the UK, it is now time to prove that. \n“How you respond to the sensible, compromise consensus proposals that the Scottish Government has put forward will tell us much, possibly everything we need to know, about whether Scotland really is an equal partner or whether that is just rhetoric.” \nTold that the view in London was that she was bluffing and would not win another referendum, Ms Sturgeon replied: “They will be making a big mistake if they think that I am in any way bluffing.” \nShe added: “I am trying to compromise, you know I lead a party many of whom would want an independence referendum tomorrow. \n“I am trying to act as First Minister to say there is compromise ground. But if we are in a position where I am doing that, but we have a Prime Minster, a UK Government that says no compromise, Scotland just has to shut up and like it or lump it, then the question for Scotland, and it is a much more fundamental question than the EU and Brexit, is are we happy with that? \n“Are we happy to have no voice in the UK, to simply have to accept the direction of travel that an increasingly right-wing UK Government wants to impose upon us?” \nShe also said again that a new independence vote could be shelved, within the timescale of Brexit, if the UK as a whole, or Scotland as part of the UK, remained in the single market. \nHer proposals for a soft Brexit would involve keeping the UK in the single market, or exploring ways of keeping Scotland in, while protecting trade across Britain. The second option would require additional powers for Holyrood, including powers over immigration. \nRuth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, said Ms Sturgeon claimed she was going to take a referendum off the table, only to put it back days later. \nShe added: “The SNP are where they’ve always been, trying desperately to use Brexit as a means of whipping up support for independence. \n“The First Minister needs to start acting in the interests of all Scots, not simply playing to her nationalist base. That means ruling out another referendum to give Scottish business the certainty it needs.” \nWillie Rennie, Scottish Lib Dem leader, added: “The First Minister is all over the place on independence. One minute she backs off, the next she threatens to break up the UK.” Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said Ms Sturgeon was sowing division when Scotland needed to pull together. \nA spokesman for the UK Government reiterated its position that it was committed to a deal “that works for all parts of the UK, including Scotland”.
