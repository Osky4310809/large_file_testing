Quite frankly, you have my community members being yanked from their homes, the streets and their jobs,\" said Yovany Díaz, a 25-year-old DREAMer who self-deported back to Mexico. \nSome 70 organizations were involved in the rallies, including Amnesty International, Mexico's National University, business and community organizations and numerous young activists. \nIn Mexico City, 11,000 people marched along Reforma Avenue to the iconic Angel of Independence with banners that called the U.S. president \"Twitler\" and read, simply, \"Stop Trump.\" A protester at an anti-Trump rally in Mexico City on Feb. 12. 2017. Mariana Atencio \nHowever, some demonstrators choose not to protest after encountering those supporting President Enrique Peña Nieto, underlining ideological fractures inside the country between those who support the Mexican president and those who oppose him. Peña Nieto's approval ratings are the lowest they've been since he took office. \nSome argued that attending the rallies, partly organized by \"Mexicanos Unidos,\" a group known to favor Peña Nieto, legitimizes his government. \nAnd high profile journalists like Gerardo Villamil from the publication \"Proceso\" warned against the rallies, arguing the focus is just on criticizing Trump and doesn't offer any solutions to the current crisis. \nThe Mexican government has reiterated it will not pay for the wall, while at the same time it has tried to maintain a conciliatory tone toward Trump. But judging from the scene around the country Sunday, many Mexicans have had enough of that.
