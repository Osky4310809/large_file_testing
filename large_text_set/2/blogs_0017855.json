FX announced today that the third season of Fargo —which is set to feature a bunch of competitive bridge with its usual dose of crime—will premiere April 19. As previously reported, Ewan McGregor stars in dual roles as brothers Emmit and Ray Stussy, the former of whom is the successful “Parking Lot King Of Minnesota” and the latter of whom is a bitter parole officer. According to FX, “their sibling rivalry follows a twisted path that begins with petty theft but soon leads to murder, mobsters and cut-throat competitive bridge.” \nThe rest of the cast includes Carrie Coon as the “steady” police chief , Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ray’s parolee girlfriend , and David Thewlis as a “mysterious loner and true capitalist.” Also involved : Michael Stuhlbarg, Jim Gaffigan, Fred Melamed, Scoot McNairy, Karan Soni, and Thomas Mann. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:57:05.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
