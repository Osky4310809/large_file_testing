Three days is no time” A chance for others \nMourinho followed it up by saying that would then mean there would be a chance for other players to get into the line up, with the likes of Fellaini and Bastian Schweinsteiger both now in contention for the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:04:41.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
