As expected, one thing led to another and the dog swallowed the ball. \nWe saw it happen. My son was playing with the ball and the dog grabbed it as it was bouncing around. \nKeep in mind this is one of those little balls you typically see in those coin-operated machines at the supermarket. They bounce EVERYWHERE. \nAfter the dog swallowed the ball, Redditor Ferenginar reacted the same way we all would. Little did the dog owner know, they’d have to shell out nearly $1,000 for medical bills following the procedure needed to removed the ball. \nThey did an [x-ray] and discovered it was too big to move past her stomach. \nNow, I doubt Ferenginar cared about the medical bills. After all, your pet’s life is far more valuable than $1,000. But I also doubt the dog owner expected the hilarious facial expression from the smug pup after the ball was removed. Here’s the moment a dog savagely smirked at her owner after they paid $1,000 to have a $0.25 ball removed from her stomach. \nDoesn’t she look like she totally meant to screw her owner out of a grand?! EVIL. \nI guess they should just be glad they weren’t this person… Reddit \nAll jokes aside, it’s a relief to know the little pup is going to be OK. And besides, she’s probably just smirking because she pooped on the floor in the other room and no one’s stepped in it… yet.
