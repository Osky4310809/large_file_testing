Because, #weather. This is a known fact, and Disney World — situated right in the center of Florida — is prepared to deal with whatever kind of storm might roll through. But sometimes, the clouds approach so fast, and so forcefully, that there’s literally TOO much rain to deal with.\nYesterday, this scenario happened. While the day started off bright and sunny, not one but TWO powerful storms hit Disney World one right after the other, and dropped a whole bunch of rain on the Magic Kingdom . The clouds actually dropped so much rain, that the water couldn’t drain out of the walkways fast enough, and the park actually began to flood. This isn’t a sight you see every day.\nOutdoor attractions were closed because of the storm, and guests in the park immediately took shelter indoors (good job, guests!). With nothing left to do but try and wait out the stormy weather, obviously everyone pulled out their phones and started taking pictures of the rising water levels. Seriously, is Magic Kingdom under the sea right now?\nWhat started off as a few lil’ puddles… A post shared by Nano Portillo (@nanoportillo) on Feb 22, 2017 at 1:51pm PST \nA post shared by Taylor Anderson (@tande58) on Feb 22, 2017 at 7:02pm PST \nA post shared by Bonnie Laufer Krebs (@boneb) on Feb 22, 2017 at 1:50pm PST \n…quickly turned into HUGE PUDDLES that guests were literally wading through.
