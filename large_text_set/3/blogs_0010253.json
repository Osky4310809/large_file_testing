The company’s own-brand tablet, the brilliant Google Pixel C , has also been gifted Nougat already. \nBuy Now: Google Pixel C at Amazon.com from $643 HTC \nThe flagship HTC 10 , last year’s HTC One A9 , the affordable HTC Desire 530 , and the HTC One M9 should all have received the Android 7.0 Nougat release by now – including in the UK. \nBuy Now: HTC 10 at Amazon.com from $568 SAMSUNG \nUpdate : Samsung seems to have officially released Nougat for the S7 and S7 Edge, and the update has already started arriving from UK carriers. \nNougat on the S7 \nBeing the biggest doesn’t always mean being the best when its comes to Android updates, and, like a lazy teen trying to be roused before noon, Samsung’s isn’t exactly known for its speedy updates. That's why we didn't see Samsung's Nougat release for the latest Galaxy phones in the UK until 2017. \nLast time around, Samsung handset owners were forced to wait five months for the first Marshmallow updates to drop, and then it was only US-based Galaxy Note 5 owners who got in early. \nBuy Now: Samsung Galaxy S7 at Amazon.com from $540 MOTOROLA \nAs Motorola’s – or Moto's, as the Lenovo-owned firm is now known – recent flagship phones have all come running the closest thing you can get to stock Android, the American firm was expected to be one of the quickest to offer the Android Nougat update. Still, Motorola didn't start properly dishing out Android until early 2017. \nThe Moto G4 has already received the update, but the Moto X Style and Moto X Play have suffered rollout delays. \nBuy Now: Moto G4 at Amazon.com from $199 LG \nLast year LG got its flagship phones on the latest version of Android within just two months of it hitting Nexus devices. That might not sound that impressive, but trust us, that’s seriously speedy in Android update terms. \nThe LG G5 has already received the update, and last year's LG V20 landed with the software on board. We're also pleased to confirm that the new LG G6 is also a straight-out-the-box Nougat handset. \nBuy Now: LG G5 at Amazon.com from $409 SONY \nUpdate: We've seen reports of Nougat rolling out to Xperia Z5 and Z5 Premium, which is great news. \nSony's 2016 flagships appear to now be receiving the Android Nougat update, and its 2017 batch of phones all ship with the new software as standard. \nBuy Now: Sony Xperia Z3 at Amazon.com from $299 \nRelated: Sony Xperia X review HUAWEI \nHuawei used to be awful at updates, but that seems to have been slowly changing. The Chinese brand has begun rolling out EMUI 5 and Android 7.0 to the P9, P9 Lite, P9 Plus and Mate 8. \nWe have to say that EMUI 5.0 and Nougat make a huge difference to Huawei phones. The UI is much clearer and it runs much smoother, especially on the Mate 9 . \nAnd the new Huawei P10 already has the software on board. \nBuy Now: Huawei P9 at Amazom.com from $449 ONEPLUS \nOnePlus began doling out a stable Android Nougat build to the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T at the beginning of 2017 – huzzah!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T16:27:14.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
