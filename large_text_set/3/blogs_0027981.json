It’s already over 35,000 light years from the galaxy’s centre, where such black holes usually reside, and hurtling away at 2 thousand kilometres per second. Advertisement \nMarco Chiaberge at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland and his colleagues discovered this rogue black hole , the biggest one ever detected, using the Hubble Space Telescope. They found that it may be ricocheting from a powerful blast of gravitational waves. \nWhen a pair of galaxies merge, their central black holes fall towards each other, meeting in the middle of the newly merged galaxy. As the black holes orbit one another, they emanate ripples in space-time called gravitational waves. \nIf the two black holes have different masses or rates of rotation, the gravitational waves radiate in one direction more strongly than all the others. As the black holes smash together and merge, the resulting black hole recoils in the other direction. Extreme kick \nWe knew that smaller black holes could merge and rebound like this, but this is the first time the aftermath has been observed with supermassive ones. \n“The amount of energy that you need to kick a supermassive black hole out like this is equivalent to 100 million supernovae exploding simultaneously,” says Chiaberge. “Nothing else can really do that.” \nIf the black hole really is being propelled by gravitational waves, they got lucky in spotting it. “This is an extreme kick – right on the edge of what we’d expect – so it would be a very unusual system,” says Daniel Holz at the University of Chicago. \nSuch an unusual system might help provide evidence that supermassive black holes do merge in our universe, a phenomenon for which we only have circumstantial evidence so far. “It’s a big question: do two supermassive black holes actually merge, or do they stall and basically orbit each other for the age of the universe?” says Chiaberge. “Seeing this proves indirectly that they can merge.” \nIt is still possible, though, that the black hole wasn’t actually kicked out at all and is just located in front of or behind the galaxy to which it seems to belong. “It could be incredibly extreme physics or it could be pedestrian astronomy,” says Holz. “Time will tell.” Journal reference: Astronomy & Astophysics , DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/201629522 \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:18:04.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
