The show has always been framed as a “social experiment”, using experts with ~scientific methods~ in an attempt to elevate its content above other reality shows. Nine\nNine\n ID: 10515871 3. And while the concept is not without its issues (like the trivialisation of marriage when same-sex couples still can’t wed in Australia), putting couples in arranged “marriages” has made for some interesting television. Nine\nNine\n The weddings might be fake, but they force the couples into trying to make their new relationships work. They go through a really intense, condensed version of a normal relationship - whether that be having their feelings blossom and continue to grow, or quickly fade and be replaced with frustration and resentment. Watching each couple’s unfolding dynamic is often the most interesting part of the show.

Aside from Andrew and Lauren, who seemed to get on until Lauren bailed on their wedding night, these couples all appear so incompatible it’s hard to understand why the experts matched them at all (beyond the obvious: drama!!!).\nID: 10516173 6. By placing them into an alcohol-fuelled dinner party with the other couples before they’ve had a chance to properly get to know each other or get past their differences, the show is setting them up to fail.

Some of the answers in the commitment ceremony were less plot twists, and more entirely missing plot points (Sean and Susan’s concern about long distance, for starters).\nID: 10516178 7.
