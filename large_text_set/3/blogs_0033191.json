The seriousness of Messi’s words are also very strong, but I think it [the suspension] can be changed. \n‘He is a sensational person and doesn’t do anything except train. He is a teddy bear with his team-mates, with everyone.’ \nThe Argentine FA insist that Messi’s outburst was made ‘to the air’ and not directly to the official, but it remains to be seen whether the ban will be reduced. \nWorryingly, Argentina have won just one of the seven World Cup 2018 qualifiers they have played without the Barcelona star, as opposed to winning five of six that he has played in. \nAt present, Argentina sit fifth in the South American qualification group, with four matches left to complete. They are currently on course for an inter-confederation play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament. \nAnd Maradona suggested his country should look to Portugal – who won the final of the European Championship last season despite an injury to star man Cristiano Ronaldo early in the game – for inspiration. \nHe added: ‘Messi’s absence is crucial. Argentina with Messi are one thing, and quite another without. \n‘If you take Ronaldo out of Portugal, they’re still a winning team. It’s the same with Real Madrid, and Barca, too.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:51:45.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
