Since then, Sushant has been linked with multiple actors, the most recent being Kriti Sanon . Rumours were rife that the two took a holiday together and have been spending lots of time together post the shooting of Raabta . TOI caught up with the actor and asked him about these rumours. Here’s what he said. \nWhen you are successful, you get talked about a lot. If you fail, people will stop talking about you. I’m aware that people get attracted to your success, not you. \nOn being asked whether being single is lonely, he added. \nEven when I was living with my family, I would feel lonely at times. I have experienced that the more you take yourself seriously, the lonelier you feel. When I was in school, I was allowed to play my video game from 4-5.30 pm and every day I would wait for those few hours. I’ve lived the last 10 years like that… Waiting for those few hours of my own time. Once I engage myself in work, nothing else bothers me. \nThere you have it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T11:07:52.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
