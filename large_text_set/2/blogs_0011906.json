For the United States market, the Expedition is available in XLT, Limited, and Platinum trim levels. \nIn terms of styling, the new car certainly looks a lot more handsome than before, with hints of the new F-150 in the headlamps and front grille. The hood bump has also been split into two separate elements, while the lower apron sees additional chrome trim around the fog lamps. \nAs for the rear, new wraparound taillights, a reshaped hands-free tailgate and silver-painted skid plates form part of the SUV’s makeover. The top-spec Platinum comes with larger 22-inch aluminium wheels, with sizes ranging down to 17-inches available for lower-end variants. \nOn the mention of aluminium, the Expedition’s new bodywork largely uses the material in its construction. Coupled with a redesigned frame that is lighter but stiffer, Ford claims the new Expedition is lighter than its predecessor by some 136 kg. \nThe SUV’s dimensions are revised as a result, with 101 mm added to its overall length, while the wheelbase is 76 mm longer (3,098 mm). For the long-wheelbase model, dubbed the Expedition Max (replaces the EL), 25 mm has been added to its length, while the wheelbase is unchanged at 3,327 mm. \nPowering the Expedition is a 3.5 litre EcoBoost V6, which will be mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission (previously six-speed), similar to the F-150 on which it is based on. Ford isn’t disclosing any output figures just yet, but expect it to be similar to the F-150’s 375 hp and 637 Nm. Models with optional four-wheel drive will get a new electronic limited-slip differential as well. \nInside, Ford has decided to provide more room and storage options to passengers by revising the cabin in several areas. For starters, the gear selector is now a rotary dial on the centre console, placed just aft of the drive mode selector, four-wheel drive controls and electronic parking brake. \nThe Expedition’s eight seats can also be slid, folded flat and tipped in a variety of ways to allow for easier ingress and egress of passengers, or to swallow cargo such as 4 x 8-foot sheets of plywood. The latter also comes with what Ford calls the “Advanced Cargo Manager,” whereby the boot floor can be flipped and folded out to provide a shelf in the cargo area. \nOther tweaks include revised dashboard, air-con vents, multifunction steering wheel and instrument cluster. The new Expedition also gets plenty of new connectivity technologies and convenience features such as wireless charging, a rear seat entertainment system, SYNC 3 infotainment system, 12-speaker B&O PLAY sound system and a panoramic roof spanning two seat rows.
