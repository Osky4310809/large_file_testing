Lights out for the 2017 season curtain-raiser at 6am on Sunday March 26 \n\"After a difficult two weeks of testing we're prepared to face a difficult weekend in Melbourne,\" Alonso said. \n\"We'll do our best with what we have and there's a lot of hard work and collaboration happening within the team, but the lack of time before the first race means you have fewer options for big changes. Fernando Alonso had limited running time during the two winter tests in Barcelona \n\"The first step will be to work on reliability before we can make any assumptions or predictions about performance, and we will try to enjoy the weekend as much as we can.\" \nMcLaren-Honda's reliability problems meant their longest stint during winter testing was just 11 laps - not even a fifth of the distance of the Australian Grand Prix. \nHonda F1 chief Yusuke Hasegawa said the Japanese manufacturer had made progress with mapping and was confident they were moving in the right direction. Alonso insists the focus of the team is on reliability \n\"In terms of performance, there has been room for improvement with mapping in order to have better driveability, and with further analysis we were able to make additional changes to be ready for Melbourne,\" he said. All the ways you can watch and follow Sky Sports F1 in 2017 \n\"We know we are heading in the right direction and we'll continue our efforts in order to increase our competitiveness throughout the season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T11:47:12.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
