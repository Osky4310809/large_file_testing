Bayer back in it as Bellarabi fires across Moya from lovely cut-back from RB Henrich. - Dermot Corrigan (@dermotmcorrigan) February 21, 2017 \nBut Falcao took centre stage in Manchester. He missed a penalty. SAVED BY WILLY!!! pic.twitter.com/YcsnVaaEQ8 - Manchester City (@ManCity) February 21, 2017 Falcao dreadful - saved by Caballero. That's the Falcao were used to in England. - Jonathan Smith (@jonnysmiffy) February 21, 2017 Willy easily mops up Falcao back pass. - Mark Lovell (@LovellLowdown) February 21, 2017 \n2-1 became 2-2 as a horrible error from Danijel Subasic let Aguero score. Subasic...one word...Shakastrophic!!! - Alejandro Moreno (@AleMorenoESPN) February 21, 2017 Wayne Shaw would have saved that... #MCIASM - Mattias Karén (@MattiasKaren) February 21, 2017 Sergio Aguero's first goal in 580 minutes of Champions League football. - Richard Jolly (@RichJolly) February 21, 2017 @ agents acting on behalf of Chinese clubs. I'm a reasonable goalkeeper. End of message. - Mark Lovell (@LovellLowdown) February 21, 2017 Subasic should just start eating a pie and be done with it - Tom Adams (@tomEurosport) February 21, 2017 Falcao pulled off an incredible chip. \nThen Falcao scored an incredible chip after destroying John Stones. You filthy dog. #Falcao - Alex Morgan (@alexmorgan13) February 21, 2017 Falcao n disgusting dirty...dinked it from 15 yards! Wow what a game @btsport - Rio Ferdinand (@rioferdy5) February 21, 2017 This performance from Falcao is confusing the bloody hell out of me. This one from Stones isn't: been a massive flop this season. - Alex Shaw (@AlexShawESPN) February 21, 2017 That Moment when you realize you're performance will make you the subject of a week-long Internet Meme pic.twitter.com/ZSBkLGrE10 - 101 Great Goals (@101greatgoals) February 21, 2017 \nSo 3-2 to Monaco. But the scoring wasn't done. Aguero got his own back to make it 3-3. David Silva corner, Aguero smashes it on the volley. Twenty minutes to go and they'll be more goals. - Jonathan Smith (@jonnysmiffy) February 21, 2017 Aguero: Back over to you, Falcao. Brilliant stuff. - Sam Borden (@SamBorden) February 21, 2017 \nAnd Stones turned from pebbles to rock to make it 4-3. My word. This game is insane. #UCL - Julie Foudy (@JulieFoudy) February 21, 2017 John Stones is the new Niall Quinn \nThen 5-3 followed. GOAL, Man City! Leroy Sané makes it 5-3 after great work from Sergio Aguero and David Silva!
