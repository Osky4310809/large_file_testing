Doctors said Dominique is expected to live a normal life after the successful surgery. \n“It’s truly amazing. I mean, you can say the words, but until you see it and try to figure out what in the heck is going on, it’s pretty impressive,” Vicari said. “It’s very exciting. Treating kids, these are the kinds of things you live for in a sense.” \nVicari said a 3-D model of Dominique was developed so medical experts could choreograph the steps that would be taken during the operation. \nNancy Swabb, a resident of the Edgebrook neighborhood on the Northwest Side of Chicago, has been acting as Dominique’s “host mom” until the infant returns to Africa next month, when she’s expected to be medically cleared. \n“She is adorable, and bubbly, and very receptive to affection and love; and we are just completely smitten by her,” Swabb said. \nSwabb said her family picked up Dominique at O’Hare International Airport on Feb. 5, and once she posted on Facebook that her family was having another baby in the house, if only temporarily, neighbors came through with donations of diapers, formula, a stroller, and more. \nShe and her husband, Tim, have two daughters of their own: 9-year old Mara and 15-year old Lena. \nDominique came home from the hospital five days after the extra limbs were removed. \n“She’s sitting up, and playing with my kids, like nothing’s ever happened. She’s amazing,” Swabb said. \nThe Swabb family said they hope to be able to stay connected with Dominique’s family on social media to see her grow up. \n“Dominique has such a special part in our hearts. I mean, she’s really an amazing baby, and has so touched us beyond words,” Swabb said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:03:55.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
