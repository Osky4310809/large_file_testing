And how do you ever believe something is inevitable?\nHow do you ever – as in ever, again – count out a great team, especially this great team, after watching the Patriots rally from 21-0 down, from 28-9 down, to capture this 34-28 victory in Super Bowl LI? And how do you ever – as in ever, again – allow yourself to invest your heart in a team like the Falcons, a team that had this game by the jugular vein and then … just let it get away ?\n( “Man,” Falcons coach Dan Quinn said, “this hurts like hell.” )\nHow do you ever again think Tom Brady – if he plays until he’s 50 – isn’t capable of anything after watching him piece together the 19 unanswered fourth-quarter points on the most challenging arithmetic possible (field goal + TD + 2-pointer + TD + 2-pointer) when just one misstep would have not only ended all hope for New England, but reduced the fourth quarter to unwatchable mess?\n(“ You know how Tom is,” Bill Belichick would say. “He just grinds away better than anyone ever has. ”)\nAnd how can you not feel bad for Matt Ryan, selected this week as the league’s Most Valuable Player over Brady? Ryan was perfect, literally for a half. But when simply being adequate would have solidified the first world championship in his team’s history, the banana peels started falling at his feet. He coughed up a fumble. He took an unforgivable sack. Matty Ice to Matty Vise just like that.\n\nDevonta Freeman runs for a first down in the first half.

Belichick has now won five titles by a total of 19 points and won this one in large measure because Julian Edelman made a David Tyree-style miracle catch on the drive that tied the game.\n(“We’ve been on the other end of those passes, you know,” Brady would gush. “That was one of the greatest catches I’ve ever seen. I have no idea how he caught it. And I don’t think he does, either.”) \nAnd how can you not look at Dan Quinn and wonder if he even wants to replace Kyle Shanahan once the Falcons’ offensive coordinator takes the 49ers job this week? Two years ago, late, as Seattle’s defensive coordinator, Quinn watched helplessly as Seattle offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell bypassed his bowling-ball beast back, Marshawn Lynch, in favor of a high-risk pass on the goal line. Sunday, the Falcons were already in position to kick a game-sealing field goal … and once again, the OC tried to be too cute, soon it was fourth-and-33, and soon it was 28-28.\n(“#@#$$#*&%!” every Falcons fan you know just screamed. \n(“#@#$$#*&%!” added every Seahawks fan you know) \nSEE ALSO \nRobert Kraft and crowd mercilessly stick it to Roger Goodell 0:0 The most anticipated handoff of the Super Bowl didn’t come... How could you not look at the defiance in Robert Kraft’s eyes as the Patriots’ owner endured torpid congratulations from Commissioner Roger Goodell before shaking his hand (as Brady, classily, had done earlier) and not detect, clearly, the satisfaction in his voice as he declared to the joyful mass of Patriots Nation: “This, unequivocally, is the sweetest one of all!”\nAnd how could you not look at the sad-eyed, hang-dog look that Arthur Blank wore on the sidelines at NRG Stadium, clutching the hand of his wife, Angela, believing he had come to the first floor of a civic coronation and slowly seeing all of it melt around him, like a surreal (and sorrowful) Dali painting? How could you not see the entire sporting city of Atlanta – now 1-168 in the four major sports going back to their origin as a big-league town in 1966 – in those eyes, in that face?\nHow can you awaken this morning with hate in your heart for the Patriots – even those devil Patriots – who played with precisely the kind of heart and grace and grit that is only and exactly what we ask from any team we hand our heart over to? Just because they don’t belong to us doesn’t mean they can’t elevate us?\n(“For a long time today,” Brady conceded, “it was hard to imagine us winning.) \nAnd how can you not have pity for the Falcons – a team so nondescript for most of its 52 years – who now must convince themselves that the sun really will come out Monday morning?\nAnswer to all: You can’t. What a game.\nWhat a hell of a game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:42:00.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
