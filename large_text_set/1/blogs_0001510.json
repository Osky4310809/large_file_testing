(Photo: Reuters) ...but that's a lifetime compared to the handful of games replacement Bradley got (Photo: Getty) \nThough bookies rate them odds-on to go down, Swansea, who sacked Bradley last week after just 11 games as Francisco Guidolin's replacement, believe they can still climb out of the danger zone. \nEven if they fail, Clement has been assured that he is a long-term appointment and not considered a short-term fix. \nClement is due to arrive from Germany on Monday, having been given the green light to leave Bayern by boss Carlo Ancelotti. \nBut he may just be in the stands rather than in control for Tuesday night’s visit to relegation rivals Crystal Palace. poll loading Will Swansea avoid the drop this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T00:53:43.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
