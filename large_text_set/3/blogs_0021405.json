My team have seen the proof of that,” he added. \nThe 30-year-old Khan hasn’t fought since getting knocked out by WBC middleweight champion Saul “Canelo” Alvarez in May last year. He is itching to return to the ring soon. \nAnd Khan badly wants Pacquiao, whom he used to train and spar with under Freddie Roach. \n“I think the fight could happen — I really believe there’s still a chance,” he continued. \n“Pacquiao is the biggest name in boxing, and I’m in the same 147 division, so it makes sense.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:23:42.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
