We’re still not really over Vin Scully’s emotional retirement from the Dodgers’ broadcasting booth back in September. So even though legendary sports announcer Brent Musburger revealed last week that he’d be hanging it up at the end of January after calling virtually every American sport since 1973, we were hoping he’d just kinda forget about the whole thing and keep telling us that we are “ looking live! ” until the end of time. Alas, Musburger called his final game for ESPN last night—a marquee hoops matchup between Kansas and Kentucky that went into overtime—and the 77-year-old signed off as only he could. \n“What a road we’ve traveled together,” Musburger said. “Thanks so much to you for sharing your time with me. What great memories we’ve had over the last almost 50 years. By now, it’s time for me to turn over the play-by-play duties to those fine young announcers who are growing up at ESPN. Make no mistake about it, I’m going to miss games like this. I’m going to miss working with all the great analysts that I’ve been working with through the years.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:55:51.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
