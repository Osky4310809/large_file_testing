Advertisement \nWhen police officers pulled Benson over for speeding, he left his car tried to walk into a nearby convenience store. The officers then tried to give him a field sobriety test, which seemingly went poorly, as Benson claimed that he could not say the alphabet from Gthrough T because he “played eight years in the NFL.” \nLocal news reporting based on court documents did not make it clear if Benson recited the alphabet from A through F before stopping and picking up again with U through Z, or if he simply told police directly that G through T wasn’t his strong suit. He also told the police that he could only count from one to three. Benson was arrested and later released on bond.
