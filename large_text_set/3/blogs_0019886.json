Another battle against Christian crosses on the property. \nThis time, it’s happening outside the Orange County Courthouse in — wait for it — Texas. \nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation is on it : \nA white Latin cross is on display outside the Orange County Courthouse next to the main entrance. In addition, there is a veterans’ memorial on the grounds of the courthouse that features a large Latin cross and the phrase, “For God and Country.” \nFFRF has no objection to honoring veterans, but maintains the crosses send several troubling messages. They endorse religion over nonreligion. And they indicate that the government cares only about Christian veterans — and disdains the service or deaths of non-Christian and nonreligious veterans. \nIn a letter to Orange County Commissioner Barry Burton , FFRF attorney Rebecca Markert points out that legal precedent is on the side of church/state separation: \n“ A majority of federal courts have held displays of Latin crosses on public property to be an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. The display of this patently religious symbol on public property confers government endorsement of Christianity, a blatant violation of the Establishment Clause.” \nThe question now is whether the people in charge of deciding whether the law is being followed are going to follow it themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:52:45.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
