There's an undeniably dark quality to the abstract imagery that's emphasized by Macintyre's lo-fi instrumental, which evokes a cloudy, lightheaded, and claustrophobic mood. \nMcintryre told THUMP via email that the track took inspiration from extreme weather conditions. \"This track came about late at night in the studio during a massive snowstorm here in Toronto,\" he said. \"The cavernous, washed-out textures featured in the song are definitely a reflection of those circumstances.\" \nDack also emailed to explain the production process, and the conceptual grounding behind the clip. \"Using a custom macro photography setup combining modern digital film making tools and lights with vintage and inexpensive lenses, I wanted to create a miniature and strange underwater world of beautiful and sometimes menacing organic shapes; oscillating between the origins of life and an toxic oil spill,\" he said. \n\"It's Not The End Of The World\" is off Macintyre's LP Secret Dream , released last year by Los Angeles imprint Distant Works . \nFollow Alexander on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:45:34.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
