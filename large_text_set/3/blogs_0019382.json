According to the model, Phobos will break apart upon reaching the Roche limit, and become a set of rings in roughly 70 million years. \nDepending on where the Roche limit is, Hesselbrock and David Minton believe this cycle may have repeated between three and seven times over billions of years. \nEach time a moon broke apart and reformed from the resulting ring, its successor moon would be five times smaller than the last, according to the model, and debris would have rained down on the planet, possibly explaining enigmatic sedimentary deposits found near Mars’ equator. \n“You could have had kilometre-thick piles of moon sediment raining down on Mars in the early parts of the planet’s history, and there are enigmatic sedimentary deposits on Mars with no explanation as to how they got there,” Mr. Minton said. \nThe findings were published in the journal Nature Geoscience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:21:25.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
