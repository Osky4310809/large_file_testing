If rumours are true, the two have been approached by their Tollywood friend Akkineni Nagarjuna, better known as Nagarjuna, for his son Akhil's second film. After Akhil's somewhat unsuccessful debut, Nagarjuna is pulling all strings possible to make sure his next venture is a hit, and is even producing it himself. \nRegardless, the film, which was earlier set to star Megha Akash, is now in hot water because Megha is no longer available to shoot the film. So, reports suggest Akhil is keen on roping in Alia for the part, and is using his father's friendship with Mahesh Bhatt to get the job done. \nAkhil Akkineni \nHowever, Sanjay Dutt had earlier tried to rope in Alia for his film, Bhoomi , through similar means, but in vain. This time, though, KJo's involvement in the matter increases the chances of Alia doing the project, as KJo launched her into the industry, and has always been her mentor. Plus, with only Ranbir Kapoor-starrer, Dragon , in her kitty, Alia doesn't have much on her plate. Already chilling in London with her buddies, we wonder if Alia is ready to jump back in the game, and that too down south.
