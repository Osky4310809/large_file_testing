And he did just that. \nThe rapper called Tyson who agreed to support, saying, well, saying things we can’t repeat on this family-friendly website but you can click here , is you want to hear it for yourself. \n50 Cent was pretty happy with his catch and shared the news on Instagram: A video posted by 50 Cent (@50cent) on Jan 6, 2017 at 5:00pm PST \nIt was just a day ago that Soulja Boy was boasting on Instagram about the Mayweather news, writing, “It’s going down … Signed my contract I’m leaving the fight with $1,000,000 I got the best ever my big bro Floyd Mayweather training me dam (sic).” Also Read: Soulja Boy Goes HAM on Chris Brown: 'I'm Gonna Knock Your B--h A- Out' (Video) \nNot a bad choice of trainers, if you ask us, considering ESPN ranked Mayweather Jr. as the greatest pound-for-pound boxer of the last 25 years. \nThe feud kicked off on Jan. 3, when Soulja Boy began taunting Brown on Twitter . Apparently it was spawned by Soulja Boy liking an Instagram post by Brown’s ex-girlfriend, Karrueche Tran. \nIt has since spun out of control and gone from throwing garbs at each other on social media to committing to throwing punch in a ring. Now it’s on its way to pay-per-view, courtesy of Mayweather’s companies — Mayweather Promotions and The Money Team — who are promoting the fight. 12 Hip-Hop Beefs Ranked, Wack to Best: From Drake v Meek Mill to Biggie v Tupac (Photos) \nIn light of the genre's most recent petty feud between The Game and Meek Mill, TheWrap looks back at hip-hop's best and worst historic beefs. Getty Images \nThe Game v. Meek Mill \n\nThe East Coast–West Coast feud may never die, even if its combatants occasionally do. In its latest installment, The Game shot disses at Meek Mill in September after the Compton rapper came to believe that Meek implicated him in the assault and robbery of performer Sean Kingston. \nThe Game released a diss track called \"Pest Control,\" while Meek Mill has yet to retaliate. As of now, this feud is still raging -- The Game likes to call his adversary \"Meeky Mouse.\" Getty Images \nIggy Azalea vs. Azealia Banks \n\nThe battle of the Azaleas started in 2012, when Banks called out XXL magazine for placing Iggy on its \"Freshman\" cover after she spit lyrics like \"runway slave master\" on one of her tracks. \n\nIn 2014, Banks called out Iggy for being quick to appropriate black culture while staying silent went it comes to black issues -- like the police shooting of Mike Brown. She also called her \"Igloo Australia.\" \n\nIggy hit back with a Twitter rant, calling Banks \"poisonous\" and blaming her lack of success on her \"piss poor attitude.\" Getty Images \nDrake vs. Meek Mill \n\nThe Philly-based rapper called out Drake in a tweet in 2015, claiming the \"Views\" artist wasn't promoting Meek's \"Dreams Worth More Than Money\" album -- on which he was featured -- because Drake doesn't write his own raps. \n\nThe Canadian rapper shot back with two diss tracks, \"Charged Up\" and \"Back to Back,\" in the same week. Meek Mill fired back with his own \"Wanna Know.\" The feud still appears to be active, as Drake released \"Summer Sixteen\" earlier this yeah, which was perceived as another track aimed at Meek Mill. Getty Images \nThe Roxanne Wars \n\nWBLS D.J. Mr. Magic made U.T.F.O.'s \"Roxanne, Roxanne\" a hit, but When the group bailed on a thank-you appearance on his radio show, the Marley Marl-backed Juice Crew cut a diss track in response, featuring teen Lolita Gooden under the moniker Roxanne Shanté. \n\nU.T.F.O. responded to Shanté's diss, which opened the flood gates for any Roxanne, Rox and Roxy to get in on the feud, which they did, with a number of unauthorized responses by acts like Sparky D, Ralph Rolle and Dr. Freshh. Getty Images \nNicki Minaj vs. Lil Kim \n\nLil' Kim, a.k.a. Queen of Hip-Hop, thought Nicki Minaj was biting her style, so shortly after Minaj's \" Pink Friday\" release, Kim recorded a diss track titled \"Black Friday.\" \"I'll turn Pink Friday into Friday the 13th, Alright you Little Kim clone clown,\" Queen Bee rapped. \n\nNicki threw subliminal shade at Kim during her 2015 BET Awards acceptance speech. Although she never mentioned her by name, many took it as a direct slam: “Please make it your business to follow your dreams because one day, you will wake up and look around and your dreams will be gone. And then you’ll be mad at somebody, but be mad at your f-", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T06:56:46.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
