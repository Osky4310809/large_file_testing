Manuel Pellegrini looks at Silva, Nasri; Payet latest 6 minutes ago KIWI a China target, Pellegrini to plunder City, Alli’s princely price, Payet’s options. \nIt’s a weekend dose of gossip in Rumour Mill. \nFROM CHELSEA TO … LEEDS \nTianjin Quanjian have seemingly failed in their quest to prise Diego Costa away from the Premier League leaders Chelsea, so ESPN FC have reported that Leeds United’s New Zealand striker Chris Wood has become the big spenders’ contingency. \nThe 25-year-old Kiwi, who has 17 Championship goals this term as Leeds United push for a belated return to the Premier League, has caught the attention of Premier League and Bundesliga clubs, too, with Swansea, West Ham, Sunderland and Wolfsburg reportedly interested. \nFabio Cannavaro’s club have already lured Axel Witsel from Zenit St Petersburg but failed with further audacious bids for Monaco’s Radamel Falcao, PSG’s Edinson Cavani, Benfica’s Raul Jimenez and Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema, according to the club’s owner Shu Yuhui. \nLeeds are Wood’s 10th English home. Chris Wood of Leeds Source: Getty Images \nMORE CHINA TARGETS \nT he Sun suggests that Manuel Pellegrini, now in charge at Hebei Fortune in China, will target two of his former favourites at Manchester City. \nDavid Silva and Samir Nasri are the reported targets of a £80m play by Pellegrini, \n31-year-old Silva is not ready to head to Asia yet, but the report suggests 29-year-old Nasri, on loan at Sevilla, is open to discussions. Manchester City's Spanish midfielder David Silva (R) Source: AFP \nALLI’S PRICE RISES \nThe Daily Express suggest that Real Madrid have decided that they’ll throw at least £50 million at trying to get Dele Alli from Tottenham. \nThe 20-year-old re-signed for five more years in September, but after his 12th goal of the campaign at Manchester City, he once again re-iterated the wonderful talent that has Zinedine Zidane and Real’s hierarchy watching him closely. Report: City, Spurs draw \nPAYET POSSIBILITIES \nMarseille aren’t Dimitri Payet’s only options for his homecoming. \nThe Daily Express suggests Paris Saint-Germain want the disgruntled West Ham star, while The Mirror reports that Nice, where Mario Balotelli is, are eager as well.
