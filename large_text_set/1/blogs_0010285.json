Pain caused by bruises, for instance, typically subside in e few hours or days as the color of the affected area fades, on the other hand, some ailments cause you to experience pain for a longer period, which lingers for several months or years. \nWhat is pain? Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Two types of pain are an acute and chronic pain. The former results from disease, inflammation, or injury to tissues and comes on suddenly whereas the latter persists over a longer period of time than acute pain, e.g. three to six month, and is resistant to most medical treatments. \nThere are many types of pain. Common pain syndromes include back pain, arthritis, cancer pain, headaches, migraine, head and facial pain, muscle pain, neuropathic pain, sciatica, and shingles. Pain is also as a result of painful disorders of the skin, sports injuries, surgical pain, spinal stenosis, trauma, and vascular disease/injury. Two categories \nGenerally, there two categories of chronic pain: nervous system and structures (neuropathic) and deep tissue and organ (nociceptive). Common symptoms of chronic pain include tingling, aching, throbbing, and burning in any part of the body. \nTreatment of different types of chronic pain may vary, however, natural foods and supplements are typically effective for treating chronic pain originated from many different ailments. \nNatural treatments include activated charcoal, apple cider vinegar and blackstrap molasses are particularly effective for relieving pain. Additional treatment options include undergoing acupuncture, avoiding artificial sweeteners and soaking in Epsom salt baths. Activated Charcoal \nActivated charcoal or activated carbon is commonly used to treat food poisoning. It is also can be used to flushed out toxins and chemicals, that’s why it is used in emergency trauma centers across the world for the safe and effective treatment of poisoning and drug overdoses. \nPlease note that activated charcoal is not charcoal used in your barbecue grill. Activated charcoal is created through a heating process, during which water vapor is added that results in the formation of an abundance microscopic pores. An increased surface area formed by the microscopic pores can effectively trap toxins in the form of many types of chemical compounds. \nSurprisingly, taken orally, activated charcoal can be used to treat pain caused by arthritis (gout and rheumatoid). It can also be used in the form of a poultice made by combining flaxseed and activated charcoal powder. It is said to be able to alleviate pain associated with cancer, sore throat, earache, irritated eyes, sprains, toothache, inflammations, and bruises. Pain will subside between ½ – 1 hour is not unusual. \nNote: Sluggish detoxification , drug/chemical abuse, chemical exposure in a workplace, and long-term uses of drugs especially polypharmacy (concomitant drugs: five or more drugs used at the same time) is associated with toxic neuropathy , which can induce pain in susceptible individuals. Apple cider vinegar \nBesides acetic acid and vinegar, apple cider vinegar contains many types of beneficial chemical compounds including similar molecules found in fresh apple, some or most of which are probably in modified forms (unfortunately, no studies to substantiate). It may contain quercetin, chrologenic acid, phloridzin, and catechin, all of which are typical bioflavonoids found in apples. \nThese phytochemical constituents along with acetic acid as well as other biologically active chemicals such as many types of organic acids, several types of vitamin B, vitamin C, carotenoids, and mineral like magnesium is believed to work synergistically in helping flush out many types of toxins and chemicals. \nIn short, many people have reported anecdotal evidence of using apple cider vinegar to successfully alleviate chronic pain including digestive problems, headaches, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis. \nNote: Taking 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil can alleviate pain much faster. Molasses \nSome people use molasses to treat health conditions such as pain associated with PMS, menstrual cramps, carpal tunnel syndrome, toothache, and ulcerative colitis. Besides bioflavonoids and carotenoids, molasses especially blackstrap molasses contains mineral including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, phosphorus, copper, manganese, and selenium. \nIt also contains vitamin B1, B3, B5, B6. Magnesium, calcium, vitamin B6 (synergized by other vitamin Bs) along with bioflavonoids and carotenoids are thought to be essential in managing pain caused by PMS, menstrual cramps, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
