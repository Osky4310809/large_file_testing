By Mark Jones, Komando.com Â© Elliot Burlingham | Dreamstime.com - Older man shocked with content on his computer, horizontal \nFinding out your family's history can be a fun project that you share with your loved ones. You never know what surprises are going to show up on the genealogical tree. \nThere are many websites that allow you to explore relationships between people over several generations. However, you're not going to believe some of the information that one of these sites lets anyone in the world see. \nFamily Tree Now is a free site that lets you look up historical records. Shockingly, the site gives away much more information to the public than you would want. Personal information publicly displayed on Family Tree Now \nThe site is easy to navigate. Just enter your first and last name, and the state in which you live and a list of matches will appear. Once you find the correct match, the site surprisingly displays this information: Your age, including the month that you were born A listing of potential relatives People you may be associated with Your current and past addresses \nThe most disturbing fact is that you don't even have to sign up to have your information listed on the site. It's already there, for anyone to see for free . Your home address is listed and anyone can find out where you live in a matter of seconds. Scary! \nObviously, this makes it far too easy for a stalker to find you. You really need to go to the site and opt out to have your information taken down. How to opt out \nThe good news is, opting out is a pretty simple procedure. Follow these steps: Click here - This will direct you to the Family Tree Now Opt Out page. Once there, click the \" Begin Opt Out Procedure \" button. After clicking on the Begin Opt Out Procedure button, you will be taken to a search page. Run a search for yourself. Click on the record detail. Verify that this record is you and not someone else with the same name. When you are positive that it's your record, click the red \"Opt Out\" button. \nThat's it, you're finished. It takes up to 48 hours for your opt-out request to be processed and then your record will be removed. \nDouble check the site, as there may be multiple records of you that need to be taken down. If there are, repeat the opt-out procedure for each record. \nAlso, make sure that you use the link to the opt-out page to have your records removed. Your request will take longer if you try sending Family Tree Now a message through its Contact Us page. \nThere is a warning on the Contact Us page stating, \"Due to high volume, opt out requests submitted here will be severely delayed!!!\" \nKeeping your personal information private is very serious. I recommend that you follow the opt-out procedure ASAP!
