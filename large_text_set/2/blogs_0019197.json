The tender yellow cake, the thick, crystalline frosting that marries caramelized sugar and butter — it's an easy cake to fall in love with. \nThe very best caramel cakes are anything but simple; the yellow cake must only carry the whisper of caramel flavor and be both tender and sturdy enough to support the frosting, which is the real star of the show. The frosting on a caramel cake is a true masterpiece — a thick, whipped caramel that will make you close your eyes in pleasure with every bite. If caramel is your weak spot, this recipe will teach you the way, step by caramelized step. (Image credit: Lauren Volo) Everything You Need to Know About Caramel Cake \nThis particular caramel cake is one that I've been working on for seven years. With a frosting technique that you might call life changing (if you're into that kind of hyperbole) it turned a near impossible ideal of a cake into something that can be easily made in a long afternoon. Rockstar bakers, intrepid beginners looking for a project, and lovers of caramel — this is the cake for you. You're going to need a lot of butter, a lot of sugar, and a little bit of patience for this cake, but every single bite will be worth it! \nThe most challenging part of making a caramel cake is making the frosting. Guarantee success by having a good candy thermometer and some patience while waiting for the caramel to cook, then cool, and finally thicken. You're baking a pretty standard yellow cake, swapping some of the granulated sugar for brown sugar for a caramel-like sweetness. Be sure to cool and level the cakes before making the frosting. The frosting requires a little candy-making know-how: First you caramelize some sugar and then you turn the caramel into a crystalline frosting similar to fudge. (Image credit: Lauren Volo ) The Best Cake for Caramel Cake \n\"Caramel cake\" can be a bit of a misnomer, as the cake itself contains no caramel or caramel flavoring. Traditional caramel cakes call for a boiled milk cake, which is fussy and prone to dryness. I prefer an updated yellow cake which includes brown sugar for more caramel flavor. The yellow cake has more butter, and partnered with the brown sugar, the cake becomes moist with a tighter crumb. \nI don't believe that every cake needs to be leveled (cutting away the raised hump that results from baking), but because caramel cake frosting isn't the fluffy filling kind of frosting, this cake demands leveling. Once the cakes are cooled, use a long serrated knife to remove the hump of the cake. You'll expose the inside of the cake, which when sandwiched with the frosting will absorb moisture from the frosting, making the cake taste even more incredible. Pro tip: You can bake the cakes several days in advance, cool them, and wrap them tightly in plastic wrap. The cakes freeze well for up to three months. (Image credit: Lauren Volo ) The Best Caramel Frosting \nThe frosting for caramel cake is unlike any other frosting. There are no eggs or powdered sugar and it is inarguably the challenging part of making the caramel cake. Have all of your ingredients and equipment ready to go, including cake layers that are cooled and leveled, and a cake plate. Here's a play-by-play of how you'll make the frosting. Make a dry caramel: Heat some of the sugar for the frosting in a heavy bottomed pan. I love my enameled Dutch oven for this, because the bottom is white and let's me keep an eye on the caramel easily. Unlike some dry caramels, you can stir the sugar while it cooks. It will go from dry sugar to liquid before beginning to caramelize. Keep your eyes on it and remove it from the heat as soon as it is an even golden-brown. Add more sugar, cream, and flour and cook the caramel to 238°F: Right to the pan of caramel you'll add the remaining sugar, flour, and heavy cream and bring the whole mixture to the soft ball stage, which is typical of fudge and praline candies and why having a candy thermometer is important here. This cooking stage is what will determine the eventual thickness of your frosting. Cool the frosting: This is where your patience will be required; the caramel mixture needs to cool from 238°F to about 100°F. This will take about an hour at regular room temperature. Pro tip : If you are both impatient and brave, you can place the pot of caramel frosting into a shallow ice bath and stir occasionally to cool. This will cut the cooling time in half, but you want to avoid getting any water from the ice bath into the frosting. Finally, beat the frosting: This is when the magic happens. Beat the cooled frosting with a hand mixer to both crystalize and cool it. The frosting will thicken to a spreadable, fudge-like consistency. If you don't have a hand mixer you can beat the frosting by hand or move it to a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Frost the cake: While the frosting is still a little warm, frost the cake. Use a little of the frosting to fill the cake and then pour the rest of the frosting onto the top of the cake. Twirl and swirl the frosting down the sides of the cake with intention and add any sprinkles before the frosting cools and sets. Pro tip: Caramel cake only gets better with age, so if you can stand it, let the cake sit for at least a day before slicing and serving. Heat the oven and prepare the cake pans: Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350°F. Coat 2 (9-inch) round cake pans with butter or cooking spray. Sprinkle a little flour into each pan, tilt and shake to distribute evenly, then tap out the excess over the sink. You can also line the bottom of each pan with parchment paper for extra insurance, if you'd like.
