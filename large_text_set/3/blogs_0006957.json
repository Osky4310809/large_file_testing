And you didn't believe it because you knew Border Patrol agents were suffering from low morale because they weren't allowed to do their jobs?\nNow you can believe it.\nThe number of people illegally crossing the U.S. southern border has dropped 40 percent since the inauguration of President Donald Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly announced, late Wednesday.\nThe Homeland Security chief said that the drop represents \"an unprecedented decline in traffic\" that it coincides with Trump's new executive orders dealing with immigration laws.\nJanuary and February are usually busy months for illegal border crossings, but since Trump's inauguration, border jumping is significantly down.\nIt looks like the president's \"controversial\" immigration policies are working.\nKelly said in a statement at the DHS website:\nThe drop in apprehensions shows a marked change in trends. Since the Administration’s implementation of Executive Orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years. This change in the trend line is especially significant because CBP historically sees a 10-20 percent increase in apprehensions of illegal immigrants from January to February. Instead, this year we saw a drop from 31,578 to 18,762 persons - a 40 percent decline.\nThis is encouraging news as in the period from Oct 1, 2016 to the Presidential inauguration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 157,000 apprehensions of illegal immigrants – a 35 percent increase over the previous fiscal year, with family units increasing by more than 100 percent. However, since President Trump took office on January 20, we have seen a dramatic drop in numbers.\nAdditionally, we are seeing an increase in the fees charged by human smugglers along the U.S. southwest border. Since Nov. 2016, “coyotes” have hiked their fees in some areas by roughly 130 percent - from $3,500 to $8,000 in certain mountainous regions. Changes in U.S. policy, including the detention of apprehended aliens, drive up the smuggling fees.\nAs directed in my memoranda implementing the President’s executive orders, we remain committed to carrying out fair, impartial and humane enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws. We will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as numbers of illegal crossings typically increase between March and May. However, the early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact.\nUnder Trump's new directives, Customs agents are allowed to send illegal border crossers directly back to Mexico, even if they’re not Mexican.\nUnder previous administrations, people from Mexico and Canada could be deported directly back home. But people from all other countries, such as from Central America, had to be detained until they could be flown back to their country of origin. https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/03/09/homeland-security-chief-illegal-border-crossings-down-40-percent/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/03/08/statement-secretary-homeland-security-john-kelly-southwest-border-security", "http://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20140622/border-patrol-union-warns-of-low-morale", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dL75NjwWDe8", "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/house-border-security-caucus-obama-not-allowing-agents-do-their-job-putting", "http://www.9news.com/news/nation-now/homeland-chief-illegal-border-crossings-dip-40/421112412"], "published": "2017-03-09T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:15:40.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
