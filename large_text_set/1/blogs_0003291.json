Kiefer Sutherland, the new Veronica Lodge, the newest Marvel superhero and other stars poised to have big years on the small screen Linda Ge, provided by Published 4:46 pm, Thursday, January 5, 2017 Image 1 of / 1 Close Image 1 of 1 17 Breakout TV Stars to Watch for In 2017, From Ricky Whittle to Rose Leslie (Photos)   \nSonequa Martin-Green, “Star Trek Discovery” We don’t know anything about the new “Star Trek” series, but it’s a new “Star Trek” series, and if you’re the star of it, you’re going to have a big breakout moment. \nFinn Jones, “Iron Fist” Marvel’s latest superhero will do his best to keep up with the likes of “Daredevil,”“Jessica Jones” and “Luke Cage,” all of whom have been breakout stars and critical and fan favorites. \nRicky Whittle, “American Gods” Bringing a sizable fanbase from “The 100” with him, Whittle is set to endear a whole new set of rabid fans in Bryan Fuller’s Neil Gaiman adaptation. \nCamilla Mendes, “Riverdale” The entire cast of The CW’s teen drama are about to become huge stars, but our safe bet is on the new Veronica Hodge, \nCorey Hawkins, “24: Legacy” Stepping into Kiefer Sutherland’s shoes is no small task, but could reap big rewards for Hawkins, who’s been poised for a breakout since last summer’s hit “Straight Outta Compton.” \nRachel Keller, “Legion” After impressing Noah Hawley on “Fargo,” the showrunner is giving Keller an even bigger breakout platform, as the female lead opposite Dan Stevens in FX’s X-Men superhero series. \nJermaine Fowler, “Superior Donuts” CBS has been high on CollegeHumor alum Fowler and retooled this sitcom for him twice before ordering it to series – time for the world to see Folwer’s talents. \nJacob Lofland, “The Son” As the younger version of the central character, Lofland is central to the sprawling Texas-set family drama, setting the groundwork for his character to grow up to be Pierce Brosnan. \nAdria Arjona, “Emerald City” “Wizard of Oz” fans, get ready to meet your new Dorothy. From director Tarsem, NBC’s new fantasy drama should be visually stunning if nothing else. \nAlison Tolman, “Downward Dog” After her impressive turn on “Fargo,” it’s about time Tolman got her own show – hopefully that talking pooch doesn’t hog all the limelight. \nRose Leslie, “The Good Fight” This “Game of Thrones” alum no longer has to share the spotlight with a cast of thousands as the lead of CBS All Access’“The Good Wife” spinoff. \nLogan Browning, “Dear White People” The Justin Simien movie made Tessa Thompson a breakout star, and Browning is set to take over the role in the Netflix series. \nPearl Mackie, “Doctor Who” The new Doctor’s Companion should prepare herself to become a star. Just ask her predecessors Karen Gillan and Jenna Coleman. \nAustin P. Mckenzie, “When We Rise” The Broadway alum plays a young LGBT activist in Dustin Lance Black’s chronicle of the early days of the gay movement. \nDylan Minnette, “13 Reasons Why” The “Goosebumps” star plays the lead in the long-gestating Jay Asher YA novel, from producer Selena Gomez. \nJodie Comer, “The White Princess” The star of the sequel to “The White Queen” could find herself becoming the next Rebecca Ferguson. \nRead original story 17 Breakout TV Stars to Watch for In 2017, From Ricky Whittle to Rose Leslie (Photos)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T03:27:58.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
