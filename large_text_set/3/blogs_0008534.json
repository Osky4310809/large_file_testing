WATCH: Pochettino also hailed Harry Kane after he won Player of the Month \nThe Spurs boss said: \"Always it's difficult to share a position with Danny Rose, who is one of the best left-backs in Europe, but Ben has worked very hard to find his place. \n\"He is a fantastic professional and boy. Only I can praise him because his position wasn't easy from the beginning, but he kept fighting, always waiting for his opportunity to play. \n\"He fully deserves to improve his contract and salary because, when we are talking about the team and the squad, this player deserves all the credit to keep fighting to keep up the level of the squad.\" Danny Rose is expected to return in April after suffering a knee injury \nSpurs host Millwall in what could be the last FA Cup game at White Hart Lane on Sunday, should they move to Wembley next season while their new stadium is completed next door. \n\"We are ready to fight. The FA Cup is special and the level of the teams is the same because they all want to win,\" Pochettino said. \n\"Wycombe was a very tough but good experience for us. We are expecting a tough game so we need to be motivated and excited to play.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T16:33:39.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
