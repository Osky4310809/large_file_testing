On Saturday, he finally got to be a part of it. \nWhen the Birmingham, Alabama, native stepped onto the court for the first time against the Crimson Tide, he had only one thing on his mind. \n“I really just wanted to beat them for real,” Wiley said. “I grew up in the rivalry and it was a hype game, really hyped coming into it. Just wanted to continue the legacy and beat Alabama.” \nHe did his part and then some as Auburn did just that in an 84-64 thumping of Alabama, the Tigers' largest win over the Crimson Tide since Jan. 23, 2007. Wiley shattered his career-high with 19 points and matched his personal best of nine rebounds. \n“ Austin Wiley was an enormous difference,” Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl said. “This game means a lot to Austin coming from Birmingham and understanding the rivalry, growing up with the rivalry. This is a bragging-rights thing for him.” \nAfter a mediocre first half, Wiley asserted himself in the second like he had not before in an Auburn uniform. Time and time again, Auburn’s guards lobbed the ball to the 6-foot-11 freshman in the post and watched as he carved up the interior of the Alabama defense. \nThe Crimson Tide often resorted to fouling Wiley to prevent easy buckets, but he made Alabama pay from the free-throw line more times than not. Wiley knocked down 11 of 18 free throws in the game and was 9 for 14 from the line in the second half. \nOn a couple of occasions, the Auburn crowd broke out into chants of Wiley’s name as he headed to the line. \n“I really don’t think about that,” Wiley said. “I feed off the energy. I hear the loud (cheers), but I don’t really hear what they’re saying. It means a lot just to get this program back and going, to get a lot of energy in the building and (for) Auburn fans to have something to cheer about.” *** Get free breaking news in the Auburn Undercover newsletter *** \nSaturday’s performance was the highlight of Wiley’s young career thus far. \nAfter joining the team in December, the first priority of the Auburn coaching staff was to teach Wiley the schemes the team’s offense was built on. Now that he’s familiar with the system, Auburn can begin to build on his strengths. \n“When Austin first got here, it was all we could do to teach him what we do, and that’s all he wanted to learn,” Pearl said. “And over the last week or two, now that we have him and he knows what we do, let’s start doing some stuff that’s best for him and take advantage of him. That’s what we’re doing.” \nWiley conceded he may have been a bit too amped up for his first meeting with Auburn’s crimson-clad rivals. But once he settled in, he was a riddle Alabama could not solve. Over a span of 8:19 in the second half against Alabama, Wiley scored 14 of Auburn’s 19 points. \n“I can’t lie, I think I was overhyped. I was just big eyed out there,” Wiley said. “But I calmed myself down and my teammates did a good job of calming me down, saying I was good.” \nAs Wiley dominated Saturday’s game, his parents, Aubrey Wiley and Vickie Orr , sat in the corner of the lower-level bleachers of Auburn Arena and wore their emotions on their sleeves. \nBoth his mother and father, who combined to go 9-3 against Alabama in their playing careers at Auburn, beamed with pride as Austin added his own chapter to the family legacy in the first of at least four matchups he’ll have with Alabama. \n“I don’t really think about how I performed,” Wiley said. “As long as we got the win, I just do whatever I need to do for my team to win. That’s pretty much how I look at it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T10:41:25.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
