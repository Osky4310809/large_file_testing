Some of the applicants, especially those who lost out, claimed that some of the winners simply copied and pasted the plans of other applicants in order to win. \n“Some of them also said they were asked by some civil servants to use specific consultants in order to be considered. \n“Contrary to the rules of the game, awards were also given to some entrepreneurs that were operating outside Nigeria. In fact, some of these people simply took the cash and migrated to foreign countries.” \nThe source added that the investigators found out that the ministry under Jonathan awarded a “disproportionate” number of awards to people from a particular part of the country. \nThe source said, “Some of the members of the team used it to set up friends and family as awardees. In one case, a husband and his wife used the same address and pocketed N10m each. In another instance, a son of one of the directors in the ministry was given N10m. \n“When the (current) administration got into power, one of the first things that the ministry did was to ask for the BVN of awardees. It was an attempt to find out if some of the awardees got more than a single slot and whether senior civil servants awarded slots to their family members.” \nIt was learnt that the BVN verification, which exposed the fraud in the programme and initiated the probe, might lead to the indictment of some senior civil servants. \nSome of the documents sighted by The PUNCH showed the rot in the system. \nOne of the documents indicated that a former director in the ministry of finance might have awarded a slot to his son. \nInvestigators are said to be probing whether the son’s company met all the requirements. \nAnother document sighted showed that two awardees shared the same surname and the same address. \nOne of the documents also indicated that two grants were given to a couple running two different companies. \nThe husband’s company is said to be involved in building and construction projects while the wife’s business, stated on the form, is ‘food and catering’ services. \nSources in the ministry explained that the ongoing probe would see investigators thoroughly combing through the information supplied by the 1,491 awardees. \nIt was learnt that the investigators would check for alleged duplication of business places, duplication of BVNs, criminal entries and other culpabilities of some civil servants and whether the companies awarded grants existed. \nLast year, some YOUWIN awardees had protested against the Muhammadu Buhari administration, alleging neglect. \nAfter the protest, a Director of Information at the Ministry of Information and Culture, Na’inna Dambatta, said a total of 18,000 young entrepreneurs were trained in management and business skills under the YouWin programme. \nDambatta added that 3,900 of the trainees, including 1,200 women, got non-repayable grants ranging from N1m to N10m. \n“The third edition of the programme, which is still running with 1,500 beneficiaries, has received the sum of N11.2bn in funding. So far, grants totalling N7.4bn have been disbursed to the awardees,” he had said. \nEfforts to get the reaction of the Special Adviser on Media to the Minister of Finance, Mr. Festus Akanbi, failed to yield result on Monday. \nAkanbi requested 10 minutes to get appropriate reaction when The PUNCH reached out to him for comments but did not get back to our correspondent as of the time of filing this report. \nCopyright PUNCH.
