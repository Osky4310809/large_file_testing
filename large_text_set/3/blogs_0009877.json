Afterlife Party” on March 11. The flier, which features two satanic symbols, promises students a “lamb sacrifice” and “live bloodletting,” a public satanic ritual in which people draw blood from a live animal. \nIn addition to sacrificing lambs, the flier promised students a “Bible Torching Ceremony” at 7 p.m. and promised the “C.U.N.T. sucker who brings the most bibles wins $25!” \nThe Clemson Unorthodox Neo-Satanic Temple claims in the flier the event was planned to “help summon Baphomet,” a goat-headed satanic figure with horns. \nBaphomet is a popular image in modern satanism. In 2014, a satanic group in New York designed and built a one-ton statue of Baphomet and attempted in vain to have the statue placed near a statue of the Ten Commandments at the Oklahoma State Capitol. However, that attempt failed when the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled the Ten Commandments statue violated the state’s prohibition on using public property for religious purposes. \nIt’s unclear whether the Clemson Unorthodox Neo-Satanic Temple truly held the event or where the event was scheduled to occur. \nThis isn’t the first time a college group has attempted to hold a satanic ritual on or near a college campus. In 2014, a Harvard University student group, the Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club, planned a large, satanic “black mass” on Harvard’s campus, but it was canceled after significant backlash from parents, students and faculty. Foxnews.com reported nearly 400 students and 100 alumni petitioned against the event. \nThe same organization that helped plan the event, the Satanic Temple, announced in May 2016 its plan to roll out an after-school satanic club for public elementary school students. According to a report in USA Today, the group is more interested in promoting “rebellion against tyranny and authoritarian rule,” as the group defines it, and places science above all religious ideas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T17:10:06.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
