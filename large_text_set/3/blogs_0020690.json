Check out the trailer below! \nDistinguished producer Raffaella De Laurentiis makes a triumphant return with a fresh installment of the legendary fantasy franchise that has delighted audiences worldwide. Packed with thrilling adventure and stunning visual effects, Dragonheart: Battle for the Heartfire on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD showcases extraordinary special features including a featurette on the magic behind Drago and a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film. \nIn an interesting bit of little-known trivia, Stewart was technically the first person to voice the original Dragonheart in the early ’90s when writer/original director Patrick Read Johnson shot test footage using a Jim Henson Studios-built animatronic head puppet. A young, unknown Clive Owen stood in for Bowen (later played by Dennis Quaid) and Stewart voiced the dragon, though the test was unsuccessful and the film was taken over by Rob Cohen, who created the dragon with CGI and the voice of Sean Connery. \nIn Dragonheart: Battle for the Heartfire , Patrick Stewart voices Drago, the magnificent dragon who became bonded with King Gareth. When the king dies, his potential heirs, twin grandchildren who possess the dragon’s unique strengths, use their inherited powers against each other to vie for the throne. When Drago’s source of power – known as the Heartfire – is stolen, more than the throne is at stake; the siblings must end their rivalry with swords and sorcery or the kingdom may fall. \nThe Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD bonus features include: \n– The Making of Dragonheart: Battle for the Heartfire– The Magic Behind Drago– Inside the Castle– Dragonheart: Battle for the Heartfire will be available on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD with UltraViolet. \nDragonheart: Battle for the Heartfire stars Patrick Stewart, Tom Rhys Harries, Jessamine-Bliss Bell, André Eriksen, Richard Cordery, Martin Hutson, Turlough Convery, Delroy Brown, Lewis Mackinnon, Marte Germaine Christensen, Ørjan Thormod Gamst, Daniel Berge Halvorsen, Stig Frode Henriksen and Tamzin Merchant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:28:09.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
