The couple tied the knot on December 30 (Photo: Craig Handfield) \n“The wedding was absolutely perfect and couldn’t have gone any better. I was treated like a princess all day from arrival until checking out. \n“I was actually very calm the entire day. I just kept thinking to myself that walking down the aisle to the man of my dreams was far easier than most other things I’ve had to deal with recently.” \nKelly, from Caerphilly, first began to feel unwell in February 2016 and started coming up in lumps. \nIt was initially thought she had a bad bout of flu but when she couldn’t lift her own head off her pillow she decided to call her out-of-hours doctor. \nAfter being seen at Ystrad Mynach Hospital she was sent to Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil where blood tests were carried out. The happy family didn't think this day would come (Photo: Craig Handfield) \nIt was discovered the mum-of-one had leukaemia and would need to undergo chemotherapy. \n“All I kept on thinking was that my daughter Ruby wouldn’t remember me if I died,” added Kelly. \n“That just absolutely killed me inside. Ruby is my life and I couldn’t bear the thought of not seeing her grow up. \n“That actually gave me the strength I needed to fight this.” \nDoctors decided to carry on giving her treatments for both her cancer and pneumonia and amazingly she was soon well enough to undergo a stem cell transplant. \nIncredibly she pulled through and now needs just weekly hospital check-ups. \nKelly and Daniel, who had been engaged three years, decided to enter the Bryn Meadows Golf Hotel & Spa ‘Win A Wedding’ competition when Kelly was well enough to return home. \nThe pair beat 350 other entrants to land the prize worth more than £5,000.

She was the flower girl,” added Kelly. \n“She definitely stole my thunder. She didn’t stop all day.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T19:48:41.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
