After debuting in 2016's Captain America: Civil War as the web-slinger, the young actor appears this year in Spider-Man: Homecoming , his first solo film as the character. Now, it's been confirmed that he'll appear in 2018's Avengers: Infinity War , and the untitled Avengers movie in 2019 (not to mention a planned Homecoming sequel for 2019. This kid is busy). Face it, Tom, you hit the jackpot. \nWell, he doesn't seem to need to be told that by any reheaded next door neighbor; he realizes it just fine on his own. (Photo: Marvel Studios) \n\"I remember going to see the first Avengers with one of my best mates back home, and I would never have dreamed that I'd be in one of these movies, let alone playing Spider-Man,\" Holland said in the new Avengers: Infinity War \"start of production\" featurette Marvel Studios debuted tonight. \"I feel like I'm on top of the world, because this is just mind-blowing!\" \nMind-blowing is certainly a great way to describe it. The actor got to officially reveal his oft-rumored role in the next two Avengers films in a fun facebook live broadcast from Iron Man himself, Robert Downey, Jr. from the set of the movie. His face covered in motion capture dots, he smiled and hammed it up for the camera in his American Spidey accent, clearly thrilled to be a part of this experience. \nExactly what role Spider-Man will play (hopefully a bigger one than his cameo in Civil War ) remains to be seen, but suddenly Tony Stark's appearance in Spider-Man: Homecoming carries a lot more weight, and it seems like that movie will be much more connected to the MCU as a whole than many fans first expected. \nMORE Infinity War: First Look Set Video | Iron Man's New Suit | New Thanos Artwork | Spider-Man Confirmed --- \nHave you seen LEGO Batman yet?
