Officers attended and spoke with a man in his 20s. He was not arrested. \n\"He voluntarily attended a west London police station where he was interviewed under caution. Enquires continue.” \nA source close to the player has told Goal that Xhaka denies all wrongdoing, instead insisting he was provoked, and says media reports quoting alleged racial comments towards an airline staff member are \"not true\". \nNeymar fails in Coutinho to Barca coup \nGoal understands that several members of Xhaka's family, including a close cousin from Kosovo, are expected to arrive in London tomorrow as a show of support. \nThe ex-Borussia Monchengladbach player is believed to be frustrated that he was red carded at the weekend for the second time this season. \nMeanwhile, Gunners captain Per Mertesacker organised a team bonding meal at Prime Steak & Grill in St Albans on Tuesday night.
