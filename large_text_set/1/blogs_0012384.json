Bush. He’s a passionate carbon dioxide advocate who once testified to the Senate that “CO2 is not a pollutant and it is not a poison and we should not corrupt the English language by depriving ‘pollutant’ and ‘poison’ of their original meaning ... CO2 is absolutely essential for life on Earth.”\nProfessor Happer hasn’t outright denied climate change. He just has a radically different take on it than the rest of the scientific community. Happer also told the Senate in 2009, “The current warming also seems to be due mostly to natural causes, not to increasing levels of carbon dioxide.”\nAdvertisement \n\nConsidering how Trump called global warming a concept “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive,” it seems like the two men would make a good pair. Happer has also repeatedly compared efforts against global warming to the Holocaust. \n“The demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler,” Happer told Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC in 2014. “Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world, and so were the Jews.”\nE&E News first reported on the meeting and mused that Trump is possibly considering Happer for an energy or science position in his administration. Trump has already picked climate change denier Rick Perry to head the EPA, so Happer would be in likeminded company. Scientists have expressed grave concern about what’s going to happen to climate change and health research under the rule of our new Supreme Leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:10:53.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
