By Gaurang Chauhan | Updated: January 22, 2017 2:46 pm Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit tons: Shah Rukh Khan reacts in a 'Raees' way \nNo one makes stylized thrillers as Sanjay Gupta does. It won’t be wrong to call him the master of the genre. After mesmerizing us with films like Aatish, Kaante, Zinda etc he is back with Hrithik Roshan ‘s revenge saga, Kaabil . Talking to Bombay times he mentioned how different was it for him to work on Kaabil than his previous films. He reveals that it has to do with Hrithik Roshan. He says, “Hrithik (Roshan) is completely hands-on, wants perfection in every frame and likes to personally supervise everything. That makes me more responsible because I can’t let his effort go to waste. I want this film to work for my team and for Hrithik and Rakeshji (producer Rakesh Roshan).” \nNot just that he went to praise Hrithik for his dedication towards the role of a blind person, he said, “I didn’t take him through any prep. I just told him what I wanted and how I planned to shoot. The rest is his doing. He locked himself up for days, met people, did his research and when he came on the set, he was the character he plays in the film. I was in awe of him. His performance is the best thing about the film. Over the last two months, we’ve seen it more than a hundred times over. He amazes me with some of his scenes. Unlike most actors, he does 500 rehearsals but just two takes.” Also read: Hrithik Roshan has an unexpected response to Shah Rukh Khan and the Raees vs Kaabil clash – watch video \nWhen he was asked about the Box office aspect of Hrithik’s previous two releases and if it bothers him for Kaabil, he said, “Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan and Hrithik are beyond the box office syndrome. Their stardom has transcended that. Yes, box office matters to everyone, but their audience and fan base won’t take a hit if one of their films don’t do well. These actors have gone beyond the Friday fears where a hit decides their prospects.” He went on to say that even he has gone past the worry of box office aspect of any film, he says, “Somewhere, as a filmmaker, I feel, in all humility, I am past my Friday meter too. My next job is not decided by a Friday anymore.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T11:34:14.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
