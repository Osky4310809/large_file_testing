Upgrade to Sky Sports now and get 12 months for just Â£18 per month! \nFour years after his retirement in 1998, McKenzie joined forces with the Croydon branch of mental health charity Mind after an introduction from one of the members of his south London fitness centre and gym. \n\"It is single-handedly the most important job I have done in my life bar none,\" McKenzie told Sky Sports during an appearance on behalf of Mind at the Lycamobile British Ethnic Diversity Sports Awards [BEDSAs]. McKenzie was awarded an MBE for services to boxing in 2011 \n\"I don't want to manage boxers or train boxers. I like to train people with mental health problems. It is far more rewarding on a personal level for me and that is where I have found my vocation. \n\"I have been so privileged and so blessed because boxing has given me so much on so many different levels in my life. McKenzie (left) with brother Clinton and footballer-turned-boxer Leon McKenzie (centre) \n\"There is clearly a link between mental health and physical stimulation and wellbeing. \n\"As a former world champion I have got a very strong mind and a very strong will, and I just try and pass on that experience to people who need some kind of guidance in their lives and to try and help educate people.\" David Haye and Johnny Nelson led a tribute to Muhammad Ali at the BEDSAs \nThe third annual BEDSAs, hosted by the charity Sporting Equals, took place in central London over the weekend, with Sir Mo Farah, British Paralympic sensation Kadeena Cox and Brighton manager Chris Hughton amongst the winners. \nMind sponsored the inaugural BEDSA Wellbeing award, which recognises the contribution of an individual, project or programme to improving people's mental wellbeing through sport and physical activity. Sonia Smith was presented with her award by Ashpal Bhogal and Isa Guha \nSonia Smith, co-ordinator of the east London-based Coping with Football project collected the award, which was presented to her by Sky cricket pundit Isa Guha and England junior hockey international Ashpal Bhogal. \n\"In my opinion events like this are really important and I am only too happy to lend my support,\" McKenzie added. \n\"I really see it as a big deal to be a part of this and do my bit to raise public awareness of the fact that people with mental health problems need help.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T11:47:01.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
