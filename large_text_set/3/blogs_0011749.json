She is also set to present the weather on news channel BFMTV at the end of the month.\n“I’ve done it, I’m finally a weather girl,” Ségard tweeted after the broadcast, “I am different, but I can do lots of things.”\nIn an interview with French newspaper Le Parisien , Segard — who reportedly cannot read or write — said that it was her “dream” to present the weather. “And this can open doors to other people with disabilities,” she said, according to the BBC.\nDown’s Syndrome is a genetic intellectual disability caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21.
