Economists have extrapolated that there is a strong correlation between the increase in broadband penetration and GDP of any country. That’s why the ministry is not leaving any stone unturned on the implementation of the ICT Strategic Roadmap, eGovernment Masterplan and Broadband plan for the country.” \nSpeaking further, he said the policy intervention being worked out with the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation would facilitate digital service delivery with benefits. \nThese benefits, he noted, include saving of running cost, enhanced budget implementation and easy identification and enumeration of government assets. \nThe ICT sector, he stressed, has the capacity to employ over 40 million Nigerians with obvious benefits to the overall economy of the country. \nThe Chairman, Board of Director of the school, Prof. Ademola Ariyo, said the ICT communications sector has the capacity to turn the Nigerian economy around if the potentials are well harnessed. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T18:09:13.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
