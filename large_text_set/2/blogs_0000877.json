About 9 percent of the companies from Pueblo that responded omitted marijuana from pre-employment screening. \nIn resort areas, 8 percent of businesses removed marijuana from all drug tests, including pre-employment. \nDrug testing in general is down across Colorado, the exception being Pueblo, Graves said. Across the state, 62 percent of businesses test for drugs, down from 77 percent that tested in 2014. The Denver and Boulder region had the smallest percentage of businesses that drug tested at 57 percent. Pueblo had the most with 89 percent. \nThe industries that had the highest percentage of businesses that drug test employees were mining, utilities/transportation/communication and construction. The industries with the lowest percentage were insurance, financial/real estate and software/hardware. \nThe most common times for tests were pre-employment and when there was a reasonable suspension. A majority of the employers that drug tested also did so after a workplace accident.
