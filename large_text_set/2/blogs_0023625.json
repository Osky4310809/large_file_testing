May Almighty Allah reward you abundantly; my sincere regards to all,” the President said. He spoke at about 6.30pm during a phone call to Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje at the Africa House, Government House, in Kano. The telephone conversation, initiated by the president who is ‘resting’ at the Abuja House in London, took place during a prayer session for the president’s quick recovery. Apart from the governor, there were many Islamic scholars, prominent politicians and Imams of the Friday Mosques. Ganduje said: “Your Excellency, you are calling at the right time, when we have gathered here praying to the Almighty Allah for your quick recovery. All participants said they are extending their heartfelt greetings to Your Excellency. “Many of those at the session expressed surprise to hear President Buhari’s voice. As he spoke, the mood changed in the prayer hall. Many people burst into tears as others expressed relief.” The governor told the President that, on Friday, there would be special prayer sessions in over 7,000 Friday Mosques. He said the call from the President was a sign of good things to come. Moments after the phone call, Ganduje told the gathering: “This is the end of my speech. We are very happy Allah has showed us that He has answered our prayers. “From the way we heard his voice, we are so happy to believe that he is recuperating quickly and with full happiness and good wishes for the country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:38:50.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
