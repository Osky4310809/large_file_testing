The Americans certainly looked more organized than in recent times, with a clear division of roles and players put in their best positions. Balance wasn't an issue, nor was possession. A few of the names returning to the fold showed well, including Darlington Nagbe, \nNegatives \nThe Americans lacked for a cutting edge in the attacking end of the field. Despite the encouraging performances of players like Nagbe and Sacha Kljestan, the result of numerous moves was wayward shots or crosses eaten up by Serbian defenders. On the other end, the US defense looks a bit out of sorts, with the full-backs struggling to find a rhythm up and down the flanks. \nManager rating out of 10 \n5.5 -- Failing to win on home soil against a weak Serbian team is a mark against the returning USMNT boss. That said, nothing about Arena's lineup or approach was necessarily wrong -- his team simply failed to create a wealth of chances and did not convert the chances they did create. Arena's substitutions provided good looks at a number of players that will help as he looks to build depth and competition at several positions. \nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10 = best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating) \nGK Nick Rimando, 7 -- Had very little to do until late in the match when called upon to make a pair of easy saves and one that salvaged the draw when Serbia hit the Americans on a break. \nDF Graham Zusi, 6 -- Stepped into an unfamiliar position and got stronger as the game went on. Beaten by speed on a few occasions, though. \nDF Steve Birnbaum, 5.5 -- Did not stand out -- for either good or bad play. The D.C. United man made one important intervention in the second half when the game was stretched. \nDF Chad Marshall, 6 -- Solid defensively and brave winning balls in the air. The Seattle Sounder was guilty of more than one egregious giveaway when trying to play out of the back. \nDF Greg Garza, 4.5 -- Should have been whistled for a penalty in the first half but was saved by the referee mis-spotting the call. Up and down defensively and did little going forward. \nMF Michael Bradley, 5.5 -- Effectively played balls over the top in the first half, and covered the backline well. Tired as the game went along and gave the ball away too often as a result. \nMF Jermaine Jones, 6 -- Up and down first half before giving way to Sebastian Lletget. Committed a few painful giveaways but gave the amount of effort expected. Darlington Nagbe's future with the national team was questioned under the last regime but he was a bright spot vs. Serbia. \nMF Alejandro Bedoya, 5.5 -- Played smart soccer on the right-hand side of midfield, but was limited in his ability to impact the game going forward. \nMF Sacha Kljestan, 6 -- Pressed well and earned the Americans a couple of chances because of it. Combined well with Nagbe in particular. \nMF Darlington Nagbe, 7 -- Nearly everything he did was good, save a few moments of indecision in the final third. Impressed enough that we should expect to see him in the team moving forward. \nFW Jozy Altidore, 6 -- Earned his 100th cap with the start and did a yeoman's job with hold-up play and passing. Isolated as lone striker and didn't get many looks at goal. \nSubstitutes \nMF Sebastian Lletget, 6.5 -- Guilty of a bad turnover that led to a Serbian chance, but was otherwise a bright spot in relief of Jermaine Jones. Drove into space and set up teammates. \nMF Chris Pontius, NR -- Popped up in a few good places and tracked back well on the right side. \nDF Jorge Villafana, NR -- Good on the ball, smart with his passes, and a danger overlapping in his USMNT debut. \nFW Jordan Morris, NR -- Stretched a tired Serbian defense with his speed. Wasted a late chance with a shot well over the bar. \nMF Benny Feilhaber, NR -- Took players on with his dribbling ability during a late-game cameo to good effect. \nMF Juan Agudelo, NR -- Added a late spark, and found himself with a good chance in the dying moments only to stay too long on the ball. \nJason Davis covers Major League Soccer and the United States national team for ESPN FC.
