But one body-positive and totally motivational model is done worrying about having \"a completely flat stomach,\" and her message is going to inspire you to do the same. Meet Brittany Cordts, a self-described plus-size model spreading confidence across her Instagram feed . She recently posted this stunning bikini photo with a powerful note about loving her body. \n\"So what I don't have a completely flat stomach? Who cares? Whats the big deal anyway?\" Brittany wrote alongside the photo above . \"What I am is strong, healthy, confident and capable of doing anything I set my mind to. My motto: If you don't like it, don't look! #byefelicia I choose to love every inch.\" \nBrittany continued to explain that no matter how many flawless models we see on the covers of magazines and on our social media feeds, the only person who matters is you. Every single person is different and has a different body, different metabolism, different lifestyle habits, and different diet, but we cannot let how we see other people with different lives influence the way we see ourselves. ADVERTISEMENT \n\"Your own opinion about your body is the only one that matters. Don't let society tell you you can only be happy once you achieve flat abs, size x, perfect skin, a round booty, etc. . . It's a trap,\" she wrote. \nBrittany's message comes during a time where we're seeing a huge shift in the modeling industry, with models with all different body types representing the same campaigns, and it's incredibly empowering. See you later, flat-stomach goals! Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:16:13.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
