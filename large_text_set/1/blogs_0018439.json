Like the majority of European pros at the Tour Down Under, the race is important in the context of the season with many arriving in Australia well below 100 %. Sagan explained that in comparison, Ewan has enjoyed summer training in the sunshine with higher expectations and motivation for the race. \n\"I did one month without the bike, relax, holiday then I start to train for December and I am really happy how I am riding now and for sure he is really motivated for this kind of race,\" he said of Ewan, adding that a lack of sprint depth is playing into the hands of the Orica-Scott rider, while acknowledging that he can only beat the riders 'on the pitch'. \n\"It' his first race, he is racing in home, he wants to win, he is a good sprinter and for now, Kittel, Greipel, Gaviria, you know the best sprinters in the world, are not here. He is still winning a lot because he is the best here I think,\" added Sagan who still has two chance in the race to steal a stage off Ewan. \nAsked of Ewan's potential, Sagan described the 22-year-old as a \"really fast guyâ€¦ but still he has to start riding big races.\" While Ewan has the world champion's measure in Australia, Sagan has bigger fish to fry and second place in Victor Harbor is likely to pale into insignificance at the conclusion of the 2017 season as he chases a sixth straight green jersey and third consecutive rainbow jersey. \nClick here to subscribe to the Cyclingnews video channel.
