Mick McCarthy succeeded Paul Jewell as Ipswich Town manager Ipswich Town's Mick McCarthy says he has not joined the string of managers sacked by Championship clubs because he has \"done a really good job\". \nNorwich City, Derby County and Wigan Athletic have parted company with Alex Neil, Steve McClaren and Warren Joyce respectively in the last week. \nMcCarthy was appointed as Ipswich boss in November 2012, and they just missed out on the play-offs last season. \nThis term they are currently seven points above the relegation zone. \nMcCarthy told BBC Radio Suffolk that the fact he is still in post confirmed that \"for four years I've done a really good job here\", but \"this year it has been tough\". \nHe continued: \"We haven't spent Aston Villa money. We haven't spent Norwich money. We haven't spent vast sums of money. \n\"And we've been competitive every season up until this one.\" 'Getting tough' \nDefender Christophe Berra has admitted that the current table suggests the team are in a relegation battle. Christophe Berra has played for Mick McCarthy at Wolves and Ipswich \n\"Seven points isn't that big a gap. Two or three wins would ease it, but it is getting tough,\" he said. \nBerra suggested the club's predicament could be down to a lack of spending. \n\"We've not made the most investments,\" he said. \"Teams in and around us have maybe done a little bit more.\" \nMidfielder Luke Hyam, meanwhile, has been ruled out for another six weeks after rupturing ankle ligaments in training. \nHyam, 25, has yet to play for the first-team this season after previously undergoing surgery on a damaged nerve in his leg.
