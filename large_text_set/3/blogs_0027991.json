Adele, who is open about her struggles with stage fright, referred to this tour as “my greatest accomplishment in my career.” She began to cry as she said, “It’s changed my life. I understand why I do it.”\nThe singer’s last four concerts—billed collectively as “The Finale”—will take place in London over the summer.
