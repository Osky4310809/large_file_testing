Chris Spags | Email \nSo tomorrow is the big debut of our dating podcast with me, Smitty, and busty broadcasting legacy Alyssa Rose that we call Swipe Drunk Love on the Barstool Sports Facebook Live at 11pm. One thing we wanted the show to be was honest above all else and be willing to look at our own lives and talk about them candidly, a safe space for us and the listeners to talk about our lives and love lives without judgment along with being quality content every week like the Tinder roundup . \nBut lo and behold during our “test episodes” that got us the pickup from Pres was one troubling thing I heard a lot of times, namely that I might be a sociopath. Now to be fair a sociopath isn’t as bad as a psychopath by definition because they have a conscience, but it’s still hard to hear. Smitty even casually dropped the ol S word in a blog defaming my win-at-all-costs-against-the-mentally-weak attitude in cornhole : \nSo now I’ve got to take a cold hard look in the mirror and ask myself: Am I actually a sociopath? Does the word maybe not mean something as bad as it seems? Aren’t we all sociopaths in some way? Am I just asking those two follow-up questions to make myself better? So we all took the test determining if you’re a sociopath on the show: \nOverall, I feel like the main revelation there wasn’t that I’m a sociopath as much as it was that everyone’s a bit of a sociopath. Even Mikey Flash who might be more labradoodle than human adult man had a few shocking yesses in response to the questions that determine if you’re a sociopath or not. Here’s a test you can take yourself (for the record: I only got a mere 14 out of 25 here, paltry amount of sociopathy at best, I’d fail the test if it were a class). Now I fully admit I am a flawed human being despite my best efforts — something that will quickly become apparent if you check out Swipe Drunk Love tomorrow — but it seems to be like these allegations of “sociopathy” are an easy thing to place blame on. If you’re single and you’re not living with your own interests first and foremost, you’re only letting yourself down. Treat others honestly and fairly out there but it’s 2017, there’s a bottomless wealth of sexy idiots out there and you only owe yourself loyalty unless otherwise specified. \nOn the plus side, other sociopaths have gone onto great success in the field of dating advice so there’s hope for all of us (mostly me): \nSucks that a fictional person was the best example I could think of as being a functioning sociopath but now that we’re taking Sociopathy back maybe more can feel emboldened enough to come forward. Either way tune in to Swipe Drunk Love tomorrow at 11pm on the Barstool Facebook Live , should be a blast that definitely won’t blow up in our faces and leave each of us with a wide variety of regrets over things we said publicly.
