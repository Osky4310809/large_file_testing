Italy, by contrast, has around 600 craft monitoring a coastline which is less than 5,000 miles long. \nAlarm bells have previously been raised by Admiral Lord West , former head of the Royal Navy, and David Bolt , Chief Inspector of Borders, among others. \nWhile the threat from drug-smugglers, gun-runners, and people-traffickers is particularly acute, Bolton was at pains to point out the more general implications with respect to large-scale illegal immigration, exacerbated by European Union (EU) regulations. The bloc’s rules make it very difficult to deport migrants who arrive after mounting illegal sea crossings, forcing their way on to lorries or even storming the Channel Tunnel . \nBolton singles out the Dublin III regulations in particular. These prevent the UK from simply deporting migrants who arrive via safe countries, unless it can be determined which EU country they first arrived in and what their country of origin is. Many migrants refuse to divulge the relevant information and destroy their passports. Consequently, only 14 out of several thousand illegal arrivals could be sent back to France in 2014. \nThe issue raises questions about the priorities of the Conservative government, which is led by politicians who campaigned to Remain in the EU. The party cut £36 billion from UK public spending in 2010-15 alone, assisted by the Liberal Democrats – but £85 billion (gross) or £42 billion (net) in membership contributions was handed to the EU over the same period.
