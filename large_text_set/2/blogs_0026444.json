Both actresses donned head-turning golden numbers, making for a red carpet twinning effect. And whew , did the looks impress!\nFirst up, let’s discuss Jess. The one and only Mrs. Justin Timberlake was flat-out flawless on the carpet, donning a mixed-metals confection in the form of a Kaufmanfranco original. The textured number featured head-to-toe sequins and a feathered collar, which only served to kick the glam factor up a notch further.\nPhoto by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic Sticking with a truly glamorous feel, the 34-year-old accessorized the glittering gown with a Tiffany & Co silver choker. She pulled everything together with a slick updo, glowing complexion, and dusty rose lips. This show-stopping look may prove one of the red carpet veteran’s best.\n“I call it perfection,” Timberlake gushed to E!’s Ryan Seacrest.\nPhoto by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic As for Dakota, the Fifty Shades Darker star went the silky-sleek route with a Victoriana-inspired Gucci number. The satiny dress with its long sleeves, delicate train, and dramatic pleats were perfectly up Miss Johnson’s alley, and the vintage Cartier jewels didn’t hurt the eyes, either.\n“There are like 20 body guards following me around for this!” Johnson laughed as she described her priceless jewels’ security detail to Seacrest on the red carpet.\nAll in all, these girls may not be up for any Oscar noms tonight, but they’re certainly taking home the gold.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:26:47.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
