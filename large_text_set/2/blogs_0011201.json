Gary Herbert signed a resolution passed by Utah’s mostly Republican legislature calling on President Donald Trump to rescind former President Barack Obama’s designation in December of the Bears Ears National Monument on tribal lands in southeastern Utah. \nThe decision to consider other cities was triggered by a host of factors, one of which is the frustration from participating retailers about the continued push by Utah political leaders for more control of public lands, organizers said. \nIt’s not the first time they have considered moving in recent years. Utah officials say they’re confident they can once again do enough to keep the show, which brings the state an estimated $45 million in annual direct spending. \nColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said Denver may be ready to host the show. The city has pledged more than $1 billion to expand the Western Show Complex event center near downtown. Hickenlooper, who has highlighted the importance of the outdoor industry to the state and to many residents and visitors, said the state would welcome the show and its participants. \nGov. Herbert declined comment Friday through his office about the new boycotts. He said Thursday that the boycott was a “political ploy.” The Republican governor also said critics’ claims that Utah is trying to take away public lands do not hold up and represent a perpetuation of misinformation. \nHe is scheduled to meet with representatives from the Outdoor Industry Association on Thursday. \nREI, meanwhile, said Friday it will still come to Utah for the largest outdoor retailer show in the world and wants other companies to attend so they can gather and discuss how to protect public lands, company CEO Jerry Stritzke wrote in a letter on the REI website. \nStritzke also said he was upset about the effort to rescind Bears Ears and complimented show organizers for opening up future shows for bids. He applauded Patagonia for its stance but said the sector must prepare to take its fight beyond Utah and to federal government officials in Washington, D.C. \n“It would be a mistake for us not to gather as an industry this July,” Stritzke wrote. “Now more than ever, we need to act together to advocate and find a common voice to protect our most important asset — our public lands.” \nBlack Diamond Equipment founder Peter Metcalf said in January at the winter Outdoor Retailer show that keeping the event in Utah makes the industry complicit in supporting rhetoric and strategies that don’t align with its values. \nIn a letter to other companies and organizations in the outdoors industries, Scott Baxter, group president of The North Face, said the company will attend the summer Outdoor Retailer show to discuss the issue and to support small companies and nonprofits. The letter was shared online by the Boulder-based Outdoor Industry Association.
