I don't know why it is so important, to be honest,” he said at the FIFA ceremony on Monday. \nRonaldo also revealed that he did not speak to Owen after his gag, while Roberto Carlos - another former Real great - has hit out at the ex-England star. \n\"I don't like these type of jokes. Ronaldo is a very good friend of mine and we have to be careful. The thing about Ronaldo is not about his body, it's his heart, he has a very big heart,\" he added.
