Then Do Something Different! By Sharell Cook Updated June 01, 2016 . \nDelhi's top attractions are dominated by ancient monuments, mosques and forts. No doubt, they're mesmerizing, must-visit places. But what next, after you've seen them? These things to do in Delhi will give you a very different and unique experience of the city! 1. Visit Asia's Largest Wholesale Spice Market \nKhari Baoli Road, next to Fatehpuri Masjid at the western end of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi, is home to the biggest wholesale spice market in Asia. Spices are what connected India to the West, and it's been in business since the 17th century! However, Gadodia Market (which is on the south side of Khari Baoli and is where many of the spice shops are) was built in the 1920s by a wealthy local merchant. You'll get to see huge sacks of spices being transported and sold. \nAs fascinating as it is, the spice market is also super congested and you're likely to feel overwhelmed trying to navigate through its interior alleyways by yourself. If you think the mayhem could be a concern, it's a good idea to see the market on a tour such as this Old Delhi Group Tour or Old Delhi Night Tour from Viator. Do note that the market is closed on Sundays. More » \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Tips to Make Coach Feel Like First Class Anders Blomqvist/Getty Images 2. Listen to Qawwalis at Nizamuddin Dargah \nHazrat Nizamuddin Dargah, the resting place of one of the world's most famous Sufi saints, Nizamuddin Auliya, attracts Sufi devotees from across the world. On Thursday evenings, its courtyard erupts with the soulful sound of live qawwalis (Sufi devotional songs) accompanied by traditional Indian instruments, which serenade the audience into a trance. One of the families that perform the qawwalis has been singing there for hundreds of years. \nNizamuddin Dargah is located in the Nizamuddin West neighborhood of New Delhi, surrounded by a bustling market, near Humayun’s Tomb. Get there just before sunset. Prepare to walk through alleyways and face large crowds, and touts and beggars if you're a foreigner. Do dress conservatively and you may wish bring something to cover your head with (although it's not compulsory if you only enter the courtyard). You'll need to take off your shoes just before you go inside. Ignore the shopkeepers who will insist on minding them for a fee. Delhi by Foot conducts an excellent walking tour.

See the Changing of Guard \nThe Changing of Guard ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan is one of many similar ceremonies that take place around the world (the most famous one is at London's Buckingham Palace). Yet, it remains a relatively unknown attraction in Delhi. Introduced in 2007, the ceremony was revamped and relocated in late 2012. It now happens on the forecourt of the Presidential residence every Saturday morning, where there's space for 200 guests. An equestrian display by the President's Body Guard, on horseback in their ceremonial regalia, has also been added. Since access to Rashtrapati Bhavan is generally restricted, the ceremony provides a fantastic opportunity to see the architecture of this immense building, once the centerpiece of New Dehli. \nThe starting time varies depending on the season. It gets underway at 8 a.m. from March 15 to August 14, 9 a.m. from August 15 to November 14, and 10 a.m. from November 15 to March 14. \nIf you'd prefer to take a tour, Viator offers a tour of Rashtrapati Bhavan Changing of Guard and the National Museum (or Rail Museum), bookable online.

Walk into the Street Life of Delhi \nLearn about the underbelly of Delhi, as you are guided on a two hour walk through streets of Paharganj and the area around New Delhi Railway Station by children who were once living and working on the streets themselves. This unique tour, recommended as one of the best walking tours in Delhi , aims to make the story of Delhi's street children heard and to give a view of their world through their eyes. It's run by Salaam Baalak Trust, an organization that provides shelter, food, and support to the city's homeless street children. The tour is eyeopening, and sadly haunting and heartbreaking in parts, as you'll witness a brutal side of the city. However, it's also inspiring as it highlights how much the children can achieve if given the right opportunities. More » Danita Delimont 5. Visit Delhi Folk Artists \nUnderneath the Shadipur Depot bridge in west Delhi, there's a slum called Kathputli Colony. It's home to around 800 folk artists, many of whom have represented India at shows abroad. Magicians, acrobats, mime artists, puppeteers, jugglers, folk singers, and traditional dancers are just some of the performers who live in the colony. Yet, the colony's time is limited. It's undergoing redevelopment and the artists will be relocated to a temporary transit camp nearby while construction goes on. For many of the artists, who belong to lower castes, life has been tough. However, they bring joy to so many through their work. \nVisit and be entertained by them on this fascinating three hour Art of Hope Tour. It's a very authentic tour that will provide you with great insight into a special Delhi community. More » Alex Mares-Manton /Getty Images 6.
