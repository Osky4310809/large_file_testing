Sanjay Singh claimed 100-seat win Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is yet again hitting the news headlines with a video that was leaked and which is now cauding it much humiliation. By: FE Online | Updated: March 14, 2017 3:33 PM AAP Leaders Bhagwant Mann and Sanjay Singh (PTI) \nAam Aadmi Party (AAP) is yet again hitting the news headlines with a video that was leaked and which is now causing it much humiliation. The video shows party-members celebrating a Punjab state government win even before the results of the Assembly Elections were announced by the Election Commission. The video that has gone viral on social media, shows the party convenor Sanjay Singh along with other party workers singing, laughing and celebrating a 100-seat win in Punjab. The video was allegedly shot on the morning of March 11, the date on which results were announced. Sanjay Singh claims that the video was made after the February 4 elections and not on March 11. \nIn this 8 minute video, Sanjay Singh was also seen calling and talking with Member of Parliament (MP), Bhagwant Mann. While talking to Mann, Singh was seen telling him that the party is going to win 100 seats and he also went on asking that whether Mann would like to be the Chief Minister of the state? On this all the party workers present there burst into a laugh. Though in his reply Mann said that he would bid for CM’s position once the results are out. \nYou May Also Like To Watch This: \nThe video was believed to be have been made and leaked by one of the party workers present on the occasion. Singh also said that he and the party workers were sharing a good time by cracking jokes, laughing and enjoying teh moment and nothing else should be read into it. ये विडीओ 4 Feb का है चुनाव सम्पन्न होने के बाद हमलोग आपस में हँसी मज़ाक़ कर रहे थे,ये कोई तालिबानी पार्टी यहाँ हँसी मज़ाक़ की आज़ादी है https://t.co/5c8pUFW6J3 \n— Sanjay Singh AAP (@SanjayAzadSln) March 14, 2017 \nCheck out the hilarious video and see how AAP party workers celabrated their ‘win’- it ultimately transpired that while Congress , under Captain Amarinder Singh won the majority on its own, at number two position came the much-maligned Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD- BJP ) alliance while AAP came in a poor third. \nAAP performed really poor in the Punjab Assembly Elections. It was not able to even reach the one-fifth mark in the 117-member house. The Aam Aadmi Party claimed to be the party of citizen power, the opponent of the politics of business as usual. But 2017 Assembly Eletions poured cold water on their ambitions.
