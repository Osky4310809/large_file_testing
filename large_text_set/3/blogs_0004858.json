Born and raised in Melbourne before uprooting to Nuremberg, Germany, Rachel Muscat has served as global director of icon collaborations at the brand since 2009.\nIn that time, Muscat has cemented affiliations with the likes of Kanye West (YEEZY,) Pharrell (Hu/Supercolor,) Palace, Alexander Wang, and Opening Ceremony. It’s not coincidental that 2015 saw the Three Stripes record gross revenue figures of more than $15 billion.\nIn a new interview with Broadsheet Melbourne, Muscat has dished the dirt on her favorite collaborations, work with Ye, and how the Three Stripes plans on moving forward in the future. Check out some of our choice takeaways below.\n“When we work with the likes of Palace Skateboarding and Opening Ceremony, it’s about how we can reinterpret what we are as a brand, but also keep the essence of who they are. I loved working with Jeremy Scott because he loved our logo. The collaboration was about how to make the three stripes in a different way we haven’t seen before. I’ve also worked a lot with the skateboarding part of our business, and one thing I took from that was this connection to true culture. For me, that’s about what’s happening on the streets day-to-day.”\n“My two main collaborations are with Pharrell Williams and Kanye West, so it’s really looking at what our key priorities that day or week are – a fashion show coming up, or a sample round you need to see, a meeting you need to plan with management and the collaborator, factories, and then the sales strategies, what city to launch our collections.”\n“Kanye is a creative genius. I have so much respect for his vision and what he’s brought to life. He’s one of the hardest working people I know. He cares about every detail … which is really inspiring.”\nThanks LA #makingmagic 👌back to global HQ #adidas ✈️✈️ first wear of my #yeezyboost 350V2 @kanyewest @wex1200 @jimfuso @sirmattgeorge @benitaylor 🎉🎉👌 marble camouflage? 🤗See u soon Nuremberg!!
