They will go on to face Puerto Rico to determine this year’s champion. It’s the first time the United States has ever made it to the finals in the World Baseball Classic.\nIt was a close game, ending with a narrow 2-1 margin for the United States.\nBoth pitchers were solid and pitched a shutout until the top of the fourth inning, when Christian Yelich made it to second base on an error by Ryosuke Kikuchi. Eric Hosmer then walked and Andrew McCutchen hit a single to shallow left field, scoring Yelich for the first points of the game.\nJapan didn’t get on the board until the bottom of the sixth, when Kikuchi struck a 376-foot homerun at the expense of Nate Jones , who had come in to relieve Tanner Roark in the bottom of the fifth inning. That tied the game, and the United States escaped the inning without further damage.\nIn the top of the eighth, the United States took the lead back when Brandon Crawford hit a single and Ian Kinsler hit a double to centerfield. That sent Crawford to third. Adam Jones ground out to third, scoring Crawford and sending Kinsler to third with two outs.\nKodai Senga managed to escape the inning when he struck out Yelich, stranding Kinsler on third base. The United States suffered a scare in the bottom of the inning when when Pat Neshek came in to relieve Mark Melancon , and Yoshitomo Tsutsugoh struck one hard into right field. Fortunately, it dropped for the third out and the United States made it to the ninth inning with their one-point lead intact.\nPuerto Rico is coming off a hard-fought 4-3 victory over the Netherlands in the first semifinal of the championship round. They are coming off a year in which they lost in the finals and are trying to make things right this time around. They lost in the final four years ago, to the Dominican Republic, who found themselves eliminated in the second round in 2017.\nThis year, Puerto Rico has been on a tear. They beat the Dominican Republic, 3-1, and then edged out the United States in a narrow 6-5 matchup. After that, they absolutely ran roughshod over Venezuela, winning that game, 13-2. Finally, they had their win over Netherlands in their semifinal matchup.\nThe final of this year’s World Baseball Classic will take place on Wednesday, March 22 at 9 p.m. ET from Dodger Stadium. Seth Lugo is set to make the start for Puerto Rico.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:26:36.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
