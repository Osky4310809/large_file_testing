Southampton have been all over the place at the back, with their inexperienced defence failing to deal with Perez, Walcott and, in particular, Welbeck. The latter has been excellent thus far, with his two goals leaving young Lewis with no chance whatsoever. HALF-TIME: SOUTHAMPTON 0-3 ARSENAL 45'+2' What an opportunity for Sims! Gibbs is caught sleeping on the ball on the edge of the Arsenal penalty area, allowing Martina to dispossess him before setting up Sims. The youngster's first touch is poor, however, and he ends up poking the ball away from him before Walcott deals with the danger. 45' The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time. 44' Welbeck brings an end to another Southampton attacking move before kick-starting a quick counter-attack, but Bellerin is unable to move the ball on to Perez and the latter ends up losing out to a good tackle from Clasie. 43' Southampton continue enjoying a good spell of possession inside the Arsenal half of the pitch before Hojbjerg picks out Sims inside the penalty area. The youngster is in a great position and quickly tries to tee up Long, but Maitland-Niles is there to dispossess him with an excellent tackle at the near post. 41' Ospina received an accidental elbow to the head as he beat Long in the air, and it's left him looking in discomfort on the floor. However, after receiving medical treatment for a few moments, he's able to get back to his feet and the game gets underway once again. 40' Long goes close! Southampton win back possession in the middle of the pitch before Hojbjerg charges down the right flank. He gets himself into a great position and swings a cross into the middle of the box, but Ospina is there to pluck the ball out of the air before it can find the head of Long. 39' Walcott cuts inside from the right wing and tries to dart into the penalty area as Arsenal search for yet more goals, but this time McQueen is able to keep the forward at bay and dispossesses him on the edge of the box. 37' Southampton push forward straight from the restart as they desperately try to find a way back into the game. They do well to win themselves a corner that is cleared only as far as Jordy Clasie, but the Dutchman's follow-up shot from 30 yards out is poor and misses its intended target by several yards. 35' Assist Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah WelbeckOnce again, Welbeck was able to skip into the penalty area far too easily. Southampton have really struggled to deal with his runs, and it was both McQueen and Stephens who were most at fault for the visitors' latest goal. 35' Goal Theo WalcottGOAL! Arsenal are running riot! The Southampton defence are all over the place as they lose the ball over on the right wing. Arsenal break forward quickly before Perez tees up Welbeck once again, and the striker is then able to set up Walcott with a cross that is easily poked into the back of the net from close range. 34' Reine-Adelaide looks excellent on the ball as he weaves his way forward. He then spins and finds Gibbs, who fires a lofted pass into the penalty area and finds Walcott, but Stephens is there to dispossess the forward at the vital moment. 32' Hojbjerg goes close! The Dane steps up and curls a strike over the Arsenal wall and towards the top right-hand corner of the net, but it doesn't have quite enough curl on it and it ends up flying into the side-netting. 31' Arsenal are sloppy in possession and allow Southampton to break forward quickly. Sims does well to dart towards the penalty area before firing a deflected strike over to Long, who is barged into by Kieran Gibbs and wins the home side a free-kick in a very dangerous position just a yard or so outside of the box. 30' Mustafi almost makes it 3-0! The throw-in is sent short to Perez, who is then clumsily fouled by McQueen. The resulting free-kick is whipped into the heart of the box and finds Mustafi all alone in front of goal, but he's unable to make decent contact with the ball and sends his close-range header wide of the goal. He really should have buried that! 29' A lovely chipped pass forward from Maitland-Niles flies over McQueen and finds Bellerin, but the Spaniard's low cross into the middle of the penalty area fails to find a team-mate and is blasted out for a throw-in by Stephens. 27' The resulting corner is whipped towards the near post and finds Lloyd Isgrove in a dangerous position, but the youngster is unable to make decent contact with the ball and ends up shinning a shot wide of the far post. 26' Great strike by Long! Martina breaks down the right wing before firing a brilliant bouncing pass into the path of Long. The striker skips past Holding and then tries to beat Ospina, but his thumping half-volley is well saved by a diving stop from the Arsenal goalkeeper. 24' Almost a costly mistake by David Ospina! The goalkeeper comes out too far in an attempt to deal with a loose ball, and he's caught in no man's land on the left-hand side of the Arsenal penalty area. Sims spins and fires a cross into the middle of the box that is deflected out to Hojbjerg, and the Danish striker then unleashes a thumping strike that flies just a yard or so over the top of the crossbar. 22' Assist Alex Oxlade-ChamberlainThe Southampton defence haven't looked entirely comfortable so far, and it was on show during the build-up to that goal. Gardos was caught out of position whilst Stephens didn't do well enough to try and stop Welbeck's run. 22' Goal Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah WelbeckGOAL! It's 2-0 to Arsenal! Oxlade-Chamberlain receives possession on the halfway line and immediately fires a brilliant lofted pass over the top of the Southampton defence and into the path of Welbeck. The striker skips past Stephens far too easily before bringing the ball down with a wonderful touch, and he then slots a lovely shot through the legs of Lewis. 21' Florin Gardos, who has looked rusty on his return to the starting line-up, commits a third mistake of the game and gifts Walcott with a chance to break towards the penalty area, but he's just about able to dart back and make amends for his error with a well-timed sliding interception. 19' Mustafi picks up the ball on the halfway line and immediately chips a lofted pass up towards the edge of the Southampton box, where Walcott is waiting. The winger sticks out a foot in an attempt to make contact with the ball, but he's unable to do so and the hosts just about manage to deal with the danger. 17' Arsenal continue patiently passing the ball around as they keep putting the home side under plenty of pressure. Reine-Adelaide picks up possession in a pocket of space before charging forward, but he's quickly closed down by Josh Sims and loses out to the Southampton midfielder. 15' Assist Lucas Pérez MartínezPerez did wonderfully well to pick out Welbeck with his clever pass, but the Southampton defence will be frustrated at how static they were in the build-up to the goal. 15' Goal Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah WelbeckGOAL! Wonderful play by Arsenal! Ashley Maitland-Niles breaks forward before picking out Perez with a deft pass up to the edge of the Southampton penalty area. With his back to goal, the Spaniard cleverly flicks the ball round the corner and into the path of Welbeck, who easily beats both Jack Stephens and Martina before chipping a delightful shot into the back of the net. 14' Chance for Arsenal! Bellerin is easily able to skip down the right flank before firing a low cross into the middle of the Southampton. It's poorly hit by the Spaniard, however, resulting in the ball rolling into the hands of Lewis before it can find Perez in front of goal. 12' Hojbjerg slips and loses the ball in the middle of the pitch, allowing Arsenal to counter quickly once again. They move the ball forward well before Walcott spins and tries to find Bellerin, but the two aren't on the same wavelength and his chipped pass bounces out for a goal-kick. 10' Vital block by Shkhodran Mustafi! Cuco Martina flies down the right wing on an excellent run before swinging a cross into the heart of the Arsenal penalty area and towards Shane Long, but just as it looks as if the striker is going to make contact with the ball, Mustafi dives in the way to stop him from doing so. 8' Reine-Adelaide wins back possession for Arsenal with a great tackle before ploughing forward. He heads towards the Southampton penalty area and then tees up Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose long-range strike fails to test Lewis and instead bounces comfortably wide of the far post. 7' Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg is dispossessed after falling asleep on the ball, allowing Arsenal to counter quickly. They initially do so well through Danny Welbeck, who had stolen the ball from the Dane, but he's unable to pick out a team-mate and gifts possession back to the home side. 6' Bellerin and Walcott, who have both started well, link up well once again before the latter tries to skip round Sam McQueen, but just as he's about to, the linesman's flag is raised for offside and brings an end to a promising attacking move. 4' The corner initially fails to result in a chance on goal before Holding wins Arsenal another corner, this time on the right flank. It's whipped in by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and eventually finds Lucas Perez, who fizzes a dangerous pass across the face of goal that misses Walcott by the narrowest of margins. 3' Early chance for Jeff Reine-Adelaide! Hector Bellerin and Theo Walcott link up brilliantly deep down the right wing before the latter spins and picks out Reine-Adelaide, but the youngster's quick shot is closed down well and deflected out for a first corner of the game. 2' Arsenal patiently work the ball around inside their own half of the pitch before Rob Holding tries to pick out a team-mate with a thumping lofted pass towards the penalty area, but it's overhit by the defender and sails straight into the hands of Harry Lewis. 1' And we're off! Southampton get us underway, attacking from right to left. The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off. Meanwhile, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has also made 10 alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with everyone but Shkodran Mustafi making way for a combination of youngsters and fringe players. There’s a first start since last March for Danny Welbeck, whilst Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Jeff Reine-Adelaide have also been handed rare appearances. Claude Puel has decided to make 10 changes to the Southampton side that started the victory against Liverpool during the week, with only Jack Stephens retaining his place in a heavily-altered line-up that includes several youngsters. Arsenal substitutes: Martinez, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Gabriel, Monreal, Sanchez, Iwobi. Arsenal XI (4-2-3-1): Ospina; Bellerin, Mustafi, Holding, Gibbs; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Maitland-Niles; Walcott, Reine-Adelaide, Perez; Welbeck. Southampton substitutes: Taylor, Yoshida, Bertrand, Romeu, Davis, Tadic, Redmond. Southampton XI (4-3-3): Lewis; Martina, Gardos, Stephens, McQueen; Hojbjerg, Clasie, Reed; Sims, Long, Isgrove. There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon… Arsenal have to face their opponents today without Arsene Wenger on the touchline after the Frenchman received a four-game ban earlier this week. The manager was also given a £25,000 fine for verbally abusing and pushing the fourth official in his side's win against Burnley last weekend. 20 points currently separate the two sides in the Premier League, but Southampton have got the better of Arsenal in recent years, with the most recent meeting between them ending in a 2-0 win for the Saints. They also enjoy an excellent record at St. Mary’s, where they have won both of the last two games against the Gunners and haven’t lost to the North London side on home soil since December 2003. Arsenal are unbeaten in their previous six games, with all of their previous three ending in victories, but they were made to work extremely hard by Burnley on Sunday and only just managed to leave with all three points thanks to a 98th-minute Alexis Sanchez penalty. They also struggled for large sections of the game against Preston North End in the third round, with their second-tier opposition finally being beaten by a last-minute Olivier Giroud winner. Southampton will be certainly hoping that this afternoon’s clash isn’t as close and hard-fought as both of the games they had to endure against Norwich City in the last round. After being held to a 2-2 draw in the first meeting between the two sides, the Saints narrowly beat their Championship opponents thanks to a last-minute goal scored by Shane Long, who went on to fire in another late winner against Liverpool on Wednesday. After suffering a disappointing new year period, Southampton head into today’s big cup tie full of confidence thanks to their third consecutive victory. Another impressive performance against Liverpool saw the Hampshire side win 1-0 to book their place in the final of the EFL Cup, and they’ll be looking to repeat that feat with a similar performance today. Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s FA Cup fourth round clash between Southampton and Arsenal at St. Mary’s Stadium.
