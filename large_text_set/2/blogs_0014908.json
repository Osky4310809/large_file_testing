And for those of you hoping he would be punished for his actions, you can rest easy knowing that things aren’t looking so good for Binks. 2 \nAn aging Jar Jar is now a street performer, juggling and doing tricks for children. He explains to a young boy that he’s ended up in his predicament after making some unforgivable “uh-oh mistakens” *groans*. \nFrom the book: \nSince children started coming in by the shipload as refugees, the Gungan has served them, performing for the kids once or twice a day. He does tricks. He juggles. He falls over and shakes his head as his eyes roll around inside their fleshy stalks. He makes goofy sounds and does strange little dances. Sometimes it’s the same performance, repeated. Sometimes the Gungan does different things, things you’ve never seen, thing’s you’ll never see again. Just a few days ago, he splashed into the fountain’s center, then pretended to have the streams shoot him way up in the air. He leapt straight up, then back down with a splash. And he leapt from compass point to compass point, back and forth, before finally conking his head on the edge and plopping down on his butt. Shaking his head. Tongue wagging. All the kids laughed. Then the Gungan laughed, too. \nThe clown, they called him “Bring the clown. We want to see the clown. We like it how he juggles glombo shells, or spits fish up in the air and catches them, or how he dances around and falls on his butt.” \nThe adults, though. They don’t say much about him. Or to him. And no other Gungans come to see him, either. Nobody even says his name. 3 \nThen the boy asks Jar Jar why none of the adults will speak to him. \n“My no so sure.” The Gungan makes a hmm sound. “Mesa thinks it cause-o Jar Jar makin some uh-oh mistakens. Big mistakens. Der Gunga bosses banished me longo ago. Mesa no been to hom in for-ebbers. And desa hisen Naboo tink I help the uh-oh Empire.” \nPoor Jar Jar. \nHe thinks none of the adults will talk to him because of the whole “aiding a heartless ruler who shoots lightning from his fingertips” thing. But maybe it’s because the way he talks is so damn annoying, the guttural moans of Jabba the Hut climaxing would be pleasant in comparison. 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:07:06.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
