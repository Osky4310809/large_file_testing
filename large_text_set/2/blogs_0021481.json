Did recent Tavon Austin tweet hint Rams asked him to take a pay cut? By Bryan Kalbrosky 13 hours ago 2.7k shares By: Bryan Kalbrosky | 13 hours ago \nLos Angeles Rams receiver Tavon Austin tweeted about value. It could mean nothing. Or it could be in response to something from the team. \nWe decided to screenshot this tweet in case it ever gets deleted. Here’s the original post : \nReplies to Austin include “ coming from one of the most overpaid players in the league ” and “ drop??? How bout you don’t drop any more passes ” on the post. \nAustin is the highest-paid player in the Rams organization. Here’s how he compared to others at his position across the league for 2017, when he is set to make $14.9 million — or 8.9% of the cap space for Los Angeles. \nBelow is the order of who is owed the most in the league next season ( via Spotrac ): \n\nHere’s what Michael Lombardi recently said about his value ( via The Ringer ): \n“Last year, he averaged 8.8 yards a catch, which would be fine if he was their backup tight end. I keep hearing that the Rams believe new coach Sean McVay will figure out, finally, how to unleash Austin’s talents in the right offense. That’s the Rams front office scouting outside in — they see the playmaking talent, only no consistently productive scheme can highlight that talent. Like Percy Harvin before him, Austin is an expensive accessory — like wearing a Rolex for show even though you can keep track of time on your phone. He can carry a play, not an offense.” \nLast season, Austin had the highest dropped pass percentage of any receiver in the league with at least one hundred targets. He had seven dropped passes (6.6%) on 106 targets. \nBrandon Marshall (6.3%) and Michael Crabtree (6.2%) were next in those rankings. Marshall makes $7.5 million next season; Crabtree is due $7M. Even if you combine both their salaries, Austin will make more next year.

Here’s what he said about him in a recent press conference: \n“When you look at the receiver position, you look at some of the things that Tavon Austin does with the ball, both in the run-game and when he’s able to catch it as a receiver. He’s a guy that you want to move all over the formation. Just getting a chance to watch his touch tape, when he’s targeted in the pass-game last year.” \nLet’s be fully clear: there’s absolutely no evidence that the Rams have asked Austin to take a pay cut. When your boss approaches you about a pay cut pic.twitter.com/uo0U1rAoSh \n— Brandon Bate (@NoPlanB_) February 24, 2017 \nBut based on his tweet, it’s easy to speculate that perhaps that’s what caused him to post that tweet. \nPro Football Focus ranked Austin as the No. 81 overall receiver last season, which was aided by his rushing statistics. As a pure receiver, according to PFF rankings, he was better than only 6.1% of eligible wideouts. \nYet with such a high salary, the Rams are limited in free agency spending, where they have just $38.9M in cap space.
