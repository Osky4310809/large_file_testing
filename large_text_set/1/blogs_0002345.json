Only one fighter managed to reach Sagat: a young martial artist named Ryu . Initially, Sagat was able to pin Ryu, and was sure that he was the winner of the match, even going to help Ryu up. However, Ryu became desperate to win the fight and was accidentally corrupted by the Satsui no Hado and his dark side and executed the Metsu Shoryuken , grievously wounding Sagat and leaving a massive scar across his chest. Sagat swore revenge on Ryu. Edit \nIn the retconned events of Street Fighter Alpha , Sagat enters the tournament to exact his revenge on Ryu, and succeeds. Although pleased that he got his revenge, he somewhat felt empty after the fight. Sagat realized that Ryu didn't give it his all, and he believes Ryu held back. Sagat eventually gave up this vendetta, considering it to be foolish and pointless. However, Bison's plane arrives at the scene. Bison comments that Sagat had succeeded in defeating Ryu, but suggests that he must master the Psycho Power if he is to be feared. Edit \nSagat dedicated himself to learning a move to rival the one that scarred him, and developed the Tiger Blow . At a later point, Adon mocks his teacher for losing to Ryu and challenged him for the title of God of Muay Thai. Sagat had not recovered from his chest being ripped open, and lost to Adon, but not before beating the younger man so hard that he would be in traction for four months. \nConsumed with rage and hatred, Sagat eagerly joined the criminal organization known as Shadaloo ; M. Bison had offered him Shadaloo resources to find Ryu and provide Sagat with a rematch. Sagat's nearly indomitable power provided him with the position of Bison's personal bodyguard, one of the feared \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Shadaloo. He then immediately set about tracking Ryu down. \nSagat soon caught up to Ryu and challenged him to a fight, with Ryu protesting that Sagat had not fully recovered from their last one. Sagat persisted, and won. Afterwards, he couldn't help but feel that the victory was hollow somehow, and realized that Ryu had let him win; after the match, Ryu had not said a word, and merely gave him a mysterious look. Sagat determined to train even harder and win cleanly the next time. He worked on honing the Tiger Blow, which would later be perfected as the Tiger Uppercut in his ending. \nSagat also encountered Dan Hibiki , now an adult seeking revenge for his father's death in the fight with Sagat ten years previously. Sagat, his thoughts still lingering on how Ryu had let him win in their last match, felt a sort of kinship with Dan during the match, and he purposely threw the fight, which allowed Dan to satisfy his anger (although he doesn't know that Sagat did so). Edit \" Sagat is known as the \"Emperor of Muay Thai.\" The scar upon his chest serves as a reminder of his defeat... to Ryu and his Shoryuken! He fights for vengeance alone... But, he's begun to realize that the power of hatred is limited. \" —Sagat's Profile in Street Fighter Alpha 3 \nSagat realized that his scar was a result of the Satsui no Hado, which possessed Ryu. He understood that true rivals should not be blinded by rage and hatred, nor be seduced by it, and realized Bison's true intentions. \nHowever, Bison presented him with a brainwashed Ryu, and told Sagat he could have the rematch he always wanted. Despite his disappointment at fighting a corrupted opponent, Sagat still fought Ryu, but sought to break Bison's mind control. He implored to Ryu that a true warrior would not give in to such treachery. Ryu awakened from Bison's control and, rejecting the Satsui no Hado, defeated and drove away Bison temporarily. Sagat finally realized that rivalries must have their limits. Sagat tells Ryu that he was almost destroyed by the corruption, and is not yet ready to take him on again. Ryu then leaves Sagat, promising to return when he becomes a true master. Sagat realizes that he must defeat Ryu not for revenge, but for his destiny. Edit \nWhile Sagat's goal in the second World Warrior Tournament was a clean rematch with Ryu, his hopes were eclipsed when Ryu was knocked out of the competition; therefore, he dropped out before his next match, finishing third in the tournament. Afterwards, he resigned from his Shadaloo post. Sagat continued to train his body and mind in Thailand, hoping to become the world's strongest fighter once again before he became too old to do so. Edit \nAfter the second World Warrior Tournament, Sagat lapses into a depression, \"feeling like a loser\". Attending one of Adon's matches in search of \"something to reignite [his] spirit\", he is mocked and challenged to a match by his former pupil. Defeating Adon with his Tiger Destruction as he is cheered on by the fans, Sagat feels reinvigorated, and then enters S.I.N. 's new tournament in the hopes of a rematch with Ryu and discovering the \"ultimate purpose of the fight\". He eventually finds Ryu and battles him. The outcome of the battle is currently unknown. \nAfter the tournament, Sagat reflects on his obsession with Ryu, realizing that instead of focusing on victory or defeat, what's truly important is communicating one's soul to the opponent through one's fists. Sagat compares his former self to Seth , whose fists Sagat says were \"mute\", and wonders whether he has changed now. In his ending, as he returns home to his village, he is greeted by Chit, his sister, and a monk (characters who all appear in the second volume of Masahiko Nakahira 's Ryu Final manga) who ask how the tournament went. Sagat replies that he \"actually had fun\" because he \"met an old friend\" (presumably Ryu). Meanwhile, Adon watches him as he leaves, vowing to dethrone him and become the new God of Muay Thai. \nIn a recent patch, Sagat has been added to Street Fighter IV for the iPod Touch and iPhone. Edit \nWhile Sagat has yet to make an physical appearance in Street Fighter V , in Rashid 's prologue story, among the many fighters using social media was Abel , whom stated that he found Sagat hidden deep in the mountains. He questions why the former Shadoloo king was at his present location. \nIn the Lair of the Four Kings stage, F.A.N.G 's statue is replaced with one of Sagat in the former's story mode fight with M. Bison since it takes place at a time when Sagat had not yet been replaced within Shadaloo.
