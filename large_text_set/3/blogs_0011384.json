Money has been an important factor in his career, but it is secondary compared to winning. \n“He will want to win the Premier League because he has won titles in every country he has played in since leaving Sweden. \n“That might be in United’s favour, ­because he will not want to leave England without being a champion. But at the same time they will have to convince him that next ­season will be United’s year in the Premier League.” \nIbrahimovic has won titles in ­Holland, Italy, Spain and France in a career that has brought an ­astonishing 13 ­championship medals.

Ibrahimovic is yet to add a ­European Cup medal to his bulging collection of honours from a career that has taken him from hometown club Malmo to Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan, PSG and now United.

If he goes to the USA it will be a lifestyle choice. There have been absolutely no suggestions that Zlatan’s wife and children are unhappy in Manchester – but his wife will be involved in the decision.” poll loading Will Zlatan Ibrahimovic be a Manchester United player next season? 4000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:29:55.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
