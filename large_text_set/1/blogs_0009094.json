Shares \nSkydiving into an enemy fortification may be the most impressive way to extract a target, but is it the quietest? Is it even the best way? As this new Ghost Recon Wildlands video demonstrates, it's probably the most violent. In what appears to be a co-operative mission, two separate players take out some guards before a third leaps from a helicopter and smashes through the ceiling of a warehouse. \nNaturally, violence ensues, and certainly not the stealthy kind: turrets are deployed, throats are cut, and even the extraction target cops a face full of metal as he's secured in the chopper. \nThis video follows the release of a cinematic trailer last week, similarly violent, although featuring a very pleasant looking cat. The game launches March 7. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Shaun Prescott Shaun is PC Gamerâ€™s Australian Editor. He loves masochistic platformers but lacks the skill and grace to complete them.
