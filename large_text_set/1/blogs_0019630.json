Escobar famously said he preferred the grave in Colombia to a US prison cell.

Follow him @paulcallan . The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

Prosecutors across the country would like to get their hands on the alleged chieftain of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel for crimes that have touched the lives of thousands of Americans. And even if federal authorities in Brooklyn fail to obtain a conviction in their wide-ranging conspiracy and drug trafficking indictment, Guzman faces similarly serious charges in California, Illinois, Florida, Texas and New Hampshire.
