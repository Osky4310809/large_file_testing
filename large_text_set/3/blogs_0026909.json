'This is a big f***ing deal' VP Biden's infamous f-bomb in 2010 To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nIt was the first big legislative battle of Trump’s presidency, and it didn’t pass. \nAfter all of this transpired, Trump called The New York Times and told them the bill failed because of Democrats and added they would try to seek a deal with him within a year once “Obamacare explodes” due to higher premiums. \nBut, in reality, the health care plan was probably doomed from the start for a very simple reason: It was awful. \nThe Republican health care plan, also known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), was extremely unpopular, with only 17 percent of the nation supporting it, according to a recent Quinnipiac Poll. It was not only Democrats who opposed the bill, but also a number of Republicans. Republicans at odds over legislation to replace Obamacare To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nA recent report from the Congressional Budget Office showed the implementation of the plan could increase the number of Americans without health insurance by 14 million within a year and 24 million by 2026 . \nThroughout the day on Friday, many members of Congress tweeted their constituents had called them about the health care plan to voice their objection. These efforts from Americans across the nation appear to have had a major impact. My constituents overwhelmingly oppose #Trumpcare . MD-08 calls/emails so far: \nOppose: 3764 \n— Rep. Jamie Raskin (@RepRaskin) March 24, 2017 Phones won't stop ringing with constituents asking us for one thing: to stop this horrible bill. #TrumpCare \n— Rep. Joe Kennedy III (@RepJoeKennedy) March 24, 2017 Thank you to the ACLU activists who sent 213,733 emails to their representatives demanding they reject the repeal of the ACA. We did it! \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) March 24, 2017 For anyone who has ever wondered whether marching, speaking out at town halls, & making calls to Congress works—today is proof that it does. \n— Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 24, 2017 \nTrump has repeatedly promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but his hopes of doing so have just being diminished drastically. We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare – and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2016 \nThis is definitely an embarrassing moment for the president, as he’s frequently painted himself as someone who can close a deal. But, in this case, he came up short, bigly. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
