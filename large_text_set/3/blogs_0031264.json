However, one was just added recently and “ominous” would be one word to describe how it looks like. \nThe new cloud is called “Undulatus Asperitas.” Its journey for recognition was a long-time mission of The Cloud Appreciation Society founder Gavin Pretor-Pinney, reports The Verge. \nUndulatus Asperitas was officially recognized on World Meteorological Day, nine years after it was submitted as a new classification. It was initially proposed by Pinney as “Undulatus Asperatus.” ADVERTISEMENT Image: Gary McArthur, Location- Burnie, Tasmania, Australia Image: Louisa Price, Location- Colchester, Essex, UK \nThe cloud formations are described by Pretor-Prinney as, “…localized waves in the cloud base, either smooth or dappled with smaller features, sometimes descending into sharp points, as if viewing a roughened sea surface from below. Varying levels of illumination and thickness of cloud can lead to dramatic visual effects.” \nFor an onlooker, it may seem like a great disaster is about to befall the earth or perhaps an alien mothership is about to make a landing. Fortunately, it’s just one of the many wondrous beauties found in nature.
