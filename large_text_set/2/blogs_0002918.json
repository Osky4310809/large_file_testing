King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 11 hours ago 25 \nTomorrow in Birmingham, fathers of metal, the monumental Black Sabbath, will perform their last concert ever.Asked about his feelings ahead of the event, Ozzy Osbourne told BBC he finds himself in a \"whirlwind of emotions.\"\"My emotions are flying all over the place,\" the singer said. \"Since I've got to this building today, I've been happy, I've been tearful. Let's see what happens.\"Going down the memory lane, Oz added: \"I remember playing the Crown pub in Birmingham and thinking, 'This'll be good for a couple of years - drink a few beers and have a jam.' But it was the beginning of the most incredible adventure you could think of. I've had the best life out of it.\"One of the proudest things I have in my heart is the fact that Black Sabbath wasn't a band that was created by some big mogul. It was four guys who said, 'Let's have a dream', and it came true beyond our wildest expectations.\"Adding that \"this is definitely it\" and that Sabbath has \"run its course,\" Osbourne concluded: \"I've got to say something but I've nothing rehearsed. I'm no good at speeches.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:29:53.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
