Topshop has answered your prayers.\nBehold the ‚Äòclear knee mom jean‚Äô. They‚Äôre mom jeans (you know, that mid-waisted, straight leg fit that flatters the very few) but with large plastic rectangles in place of denim over the knees.\n(Picture: Topshop) Why? Well, we‚Äôre not entirely sure.\nMaybe this is a cool new trend people over the age of 21 simply cannot understand.\nMaybe knees are the new erogenous zone to display proudly to the world.\nPerhaps these jeans are for those days when you‚Äôve actually bothered to shave your legs above the shins and you want to show off your hard work to the world.\nWho knows?\nAll we know is that these jeans cost ¬£49 (or ¬£82.91 on Nordstrom, for some reason), and they have divided the world.\nSome people despise them with the fire of a thousand suns.
