By now, you know the drill: people on Twitter delighted in rubbing Dallas’ face in the loss. As the self-proclaimed America’s Team, the Cowboys are just an easy target for everyone.\nBefore we get to all the online people dunking on the Cowboys, or just holding their hearts after the game’s crazy finish, let’s take a moment to appreciate the Cowboys fans who, true to their overconfident nature, started taking their victory laps way too early. Like Skip Bayless, who tweeted this out when the Packers still had 30 seconds left. \nCongratulations to Dak Prescott for again outplaying Aaron Rodgers, again holding off Romo and again performing like a clutch MVP.\n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) January 16, 2017 \n\n\nYou’ve got to give it to the man — he works really hard to be this wrong. But he’s not nearly as committed as this poor fan, whose tweet from December blew up again after the game for predictable reasons:\n@nfl Hey Dallas Cowboys! Now it's official. Don't let me down.
