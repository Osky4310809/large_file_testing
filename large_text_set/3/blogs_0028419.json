She never leaves my side as shown perfectly in the photo above. She sticks to me as surely and as loyal as the shadow I know will be there on a sunny day. This January 2017 she proved this beyond any doubt that I may have ever had. 2 \nThis is Dixie (isn’t she beautiful). January 20th this year we were on our normal walk right before I headed to work for the evening. Her human father (My soon to be husband, we are getting married in May) was working a double shift and was not scheduled to be home for at least 12 more hrs. It had just rained and the ground was super wet and quite slippery for me trying to get a grip while walking. We were about a block from the apartment when I was walking down a small grass hill. I slipped on the wet grass and landed directly on top of my ankle, hearing and feeling a very prominent SNAP! 3 \nWhile laying on the ground seeing my ankle in the most unnatural position I’ve ever seen. I reached for my phone realizing I can’t walk… nope it’s on the coffee at home. Sheer panic, helplessness, and a lot of pain set in as I realized I was in some trouble. That’s when a warm wet nose touched my cheek and licked the few tears I didn’t even know were on my face, then she laid down directly next to me. “No mom never alone” 4 \nI sat there praying for about 20 mins that someone would come along so I could awkwardly ask them for assistance but no such luck. That’s when I decided I could either sit here on the cold wet ground and wish for help or I could do something to get help. So I rolled myself over and got on myself on all fours and looked at Dixie like please just DON’T drag me. I started my crawl home and true to her nature not only did she not pull on me at all she merely paced me the whole way, an occasional encouraging nudge when I stop due to pain. “Mom, you’re almost there!” 5 \nWe eventually make it to the front of the apartment and I was so happy but then realized we live up two flights of stairs. No turning back now, so I crawl up to the first step. Position Dixie up two of the steps then grab her collar with my left hand and a hand full of her fur in the right. Lean in close to her face and tell her that she’s a good girl and to STAY. Then I pulled myself up one step then the next. Positioned her up two more steps and repeated until I made it to my front door. We got in the apartment I crawled to my phone and called help. She laid next to me on the floor as I waited for EMTs to show up and even had to be pulled back and kenneled for them to touch me because she was getting upset and a bit testy with them.
