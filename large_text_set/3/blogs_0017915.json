Already, they have identified one very strong candidate, according to SpaceNews . \nWhat makes a good landing spot for a Mars spacecraft? Proximity to ice near the surface of the planet is a big one, because thatâ€™s going to be ðŸ”‘ to any settlementâ€™s ability to maintain itself during long spells without support from Earth-based shipments. Another important factor is low elevation and positioning near the equator for better sun exposure, for both power and thermal conditions. Those donâ€™t normally co-exist with large quantities of ice not far from the surface, so that has helped narrow the potential touchdown points to just a handful. \nThese Mars landing points assume compatibility with SpaceXâ€™s long-term goal of going to Mars and staying there, but the company could also land elsewhere on the planet to satisfy other needs, for scientific and commercial clients, for example. \nMars for SpaceX is still a relatively distant target â€“ its planned first launch to the red planet was originally slated for 2018, but itâ€™s now much more likely to occur in mid-2020 at the earliest, according to the company. At least it looks like that first mission will know exactly where itâ€™s headed long in advance.
