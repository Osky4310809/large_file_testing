And while a series of new videos aren't officially tied to the project, they're certainly enough to get fans excited. \nTina Guo, who helped create the now-iconic theme 'Is She With You?' for Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice , recently shared several videos on Twitter of her reworking the song. While elements of the song, which she co-created with Hans Zimmer, are still present, the pieces of Guo's new version are much more heavy metal in tone. \nThe first video showcases Guo playing the song on electric cello, while the second one shows her playing a bass track. — Tina Guo (@Tinaguo) March 5, 2017 \nGuo later confirmed that the track is her own personal single, which is sure to be disappointing news for fans hoping to hear this heavy-metal version of the theme in the upcoming film. But Guo also reassured that she is, in fact, involved with the Wonder Woman soundtrack, although its unclear exactly in what capacity. \nWhile the Batman v. Superman version of 'Is She With You?' was played in Wonder Woman 's first trailer, it is unclear if a version of it will actually be heard in the film itself. \nFans of the film - and of Guo's awesome renditions of the song - will just have to wait and see exactly how the Wonder Woman soundtrack shapes up. \nWonder Woman , directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot as Diana, Princess of Themyscira, is in post-production now for a June 2, 2017 release. \nBefore she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, when an American pilot, Steve Trevor, played by Chris Pine, crashes on their shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. Fighting alongside man in a war to end all wars, Diana will discover her full powers...and her true destiny. \nMore Wonder Woman News:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:22:44.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
