Dell's UltraSharp 32\" 8K monitor will be the first of its kind to reach the masses when it goes on sale in March. It packs in 33.2MP of resolution (280 ppi) and provides 100% Adobe RGB and sRGB color gamut. If that sounds enticing, you might want to start saving: it'll start at $4999 when it goes on sale March 23rd. \nA thin 9.7mm bezel keeps it looking sleek, and the monitor offers two Displayport 3.1 connections and four USB 3.0 ports. Dell's product information claims the monitor displays 1.07 billion colors, and lists an X-Rite color checker as 'optional hardware,' but we're pretty sure you'd want to throw one of those in too. \nPCWorld points out that just because you can buy an 8K monitor doesn't mean you should pull the trigger just yet. They suggest waiting until GPUs can keep up, which will likely be later this year. \nSo are you ready to shell out $5000 for 8K, or will you wait a while?
