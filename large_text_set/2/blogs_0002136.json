There was no sand in sight at Deception Bay at the weekend when thousands of jellyfish stranded themselves \n\"It's amazing actually,\" Dr Strauss said. \n\"I guess though, if you consider how many people go for a swim down at Burleigh over summer often with their sunnies and their goggles on...\" \nHe said the large haul of eyewear could just be this summer's collection of lost glasses from Burleigh Heads beach as the lightweight plastic items gather in the depths with the seaweed. \n\"They just drift out to that deeper water where not much is really happening,\" Dr Strauss said. \n\"Over time, they're gathering out there and just washing backwards and forwards.\" \nHe said the causes could be similar to recent mass of jellyfish washing up in Deception Bay. \n\"The wind ... kind of collects that stuff in the corner at Burleigh,\" he said. \n\"The other process is upwelling [where] the surface water is moving offshore and it gets replaced by cold water from underneath.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:28:08.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
