Punk rock hasn't been punk rock for 30 years. For too long metal has been bullshit, milky pandering crap. What happened to metal? What happened to punk rock? What happened to being anti-establishment? I wanna bring that all back.\" \nThe musician added: \"Our goal has always been to write songs that we like. All That Remains has seen a lot of criticism about the songs that we've written and what people think we're supposed to do. \n\"We started as a very underground death metal kind of band, we've since moved away from that and have never apologized for it. The music we've written has been reflective of that and I think the lyrics, the ideas, have always been reflective of that as well.\" \n\"Madness\" is due out on April 28, you can check out the title track single below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T11:43:19.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
