Liverpool's new chief executive profiled Moore, 62, replaces Ian Ayre who has accepted a position at 1860 Munich Share Get Liverpool   Thank you for subscribing!   \nPeter Moore will become Liverpool's new chief executive following the departure of Ian Ayre, who has joined 1860 Munich. \nMoore is a 62-year-old Liverpool-born businessman will leave his role as chief competition officer for gaming giant Electronic Arts in the US. But what do we really know about him. \nHere, the Liverpool Echo's James Pearce profiles the new Anfield chief... What's his background? \nIt's fair to say that Moore will bring with him a wealth of business experience. \nHe studied at Keele University before doing a masters degree at California State University. After spells working for sportswear companies Patrick USA and Reebok in marketing, he moved into the gaming industry after taking on a role with Sega. \nMoore, who was key to the initial success of the Dreamcast game console, rose up the ranks to become president and chief operations company of Sega of America. \nHe's never shied away from making big decisions. He announced in 2001 that Sega would quit the hardware market amid tough competition from PlayStation and focus on developing games instead. \n“I had to fire a lot of people. It was not a pleasant day,” he said. Moore replaces Ian Ayre (Photo: Reuters) \nn 2003 Microsoft secured Moore's services as corporate vice-president of their interactive entertainment business division to help them boost Xbox's market share and launch the Xbox 360. He drummed up publicity for the launch of the game Halo 2 by getting a supposedly permanent tattoo of the release date on his arm. \nIn 2007 he moved on to Electronic Arts to head up their sports division and another reshuffle saw him promoted to the role of chief operating officer. He's been credited with the immense success of their FIFA video game series. \nIn December 2015 he was appointed as the chief competition officer for EA's new competitive gaming division. \nAfter a decade of service to EA he has decided to pursue a new challenge with Liverpool.

For a boyhood Reds fan, this is a dream job for him. \nSpeaking to the Telegraph back in 2009, he said: “I’m a Scouser by birth and football is my passion. \n“My dad took me to Anfield when I was four, in 1959, and I’ve bled red ever since. \n“I had the pleasure of getting involved with them when I was at Reebok, when we did the kit deal, which was a big thrill for me. But, yeah, I live and die Liverpool.” Moore says he has always supported Liverpool (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty Images) What do other people say about him? \nThe announcement of his departure from Electronic Arts has been accompanied by a gushing tribute on their website from their CEO Andrew Wilson. \n“Passion is essential for all of us at Electronic Arts,” Wilson said. \n“It’s what gets us up in the morning and drives us to do extraordinary things. \n“And if you’ve ever met Peter Moore, you know that he quite literally wears his passion for Liverpool FC on his sleeve. So it’s with great excitement that we congratulate Peter on following his dream to become the next CEO of his beloved Liverpool Football Club. \n“I believe deeply in following our passions and dreams in life. Spend every moment doing something that you love. \n“We’ve been fortunate to have Peter doing that with us here for almost a decade. We could not be happier to see him take the helm at Liverpool, and I personally could not be more honoured to call Peter a dear friend for life. \n“Peter has built a fantastic team that is now running dozens of global tournaments and events with millions of players With more exciting expansion plans on the horizon, Peter will be working with the teams to drive a leadership transition before he returns to the UK this summer.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:33:57.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
