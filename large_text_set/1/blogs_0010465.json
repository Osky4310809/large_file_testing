Alicia McElhaney Jan11,20175:08PMEST \nAs if there wasn't enough turmoil around Mylan ( MYL ) , things may have just gotten worse for the company even as its CEO reassured investors in presentation Wednesday. \nCigna ( CI ) will no longer cover Mylan's EpiPen and EpiPen Jr. autoinjectors, instead encouraging patients to use Impax 's ( IPXL ) generic device for treatment of severe allergic reactions. \nThe move was effective as of Jan. 7, when Cigna released a list of changes to coverage for 2017. In it, Cigna officials wrote that EpiPen is no longer covered, and that the plan \"requires approval from Cigna for these medications to be covered.\" \nMylan's Heather Bresch on Wednesday told attendees of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference that healthcare's pricing model and the interaction between the entire supply chain needs to be revisited. The CEO asserted that the lines between pharma, biotech and generic have blurred. \n\"As I reflect on 2016, I guess I would start by saying the EpiPen started an important discussion and dialogue,\" Bresch said at San Francisco's Westin St. Francis Hotel \n\"If I look at five entities that go across the healthcare supply chain, all the discussion has just been around one of those five - the drug manufacturers.\" \nBresch described the launch of its generic EpiPen at half-price as an \"unprecedented\" and \"responsible\" move. \nAccording to Cigna, if a doctor feels that a generic isn't as effective for a patient, they can ask the insurer for an exception; however, this does not guarantee that the drug will be covered under the patient's healthcare plan. \nThe company had became the scapegoat for public outrage over high drug pricing earlier last year, when news that EpiPen saw price increases from the company 25% year-over-year. The drug industry average is 10% increasing in prices. \nPatients saw prices for EpiPen between $600 and $700 per two pack in 2016, according to GoodRx. As a result, Mylan now offers a $300 off coupon for the name-brand version of the drug. \nThe Pittsburgh-based company made moves to trim prices of the drug, and now offers a generic for $300 per two-pack. Mylan offers a $25 discount for the generic. \nAs Mylan was taking heat for its drug pricing, the company was hit with the additional bad news when it was disclosed the company had been misclassified by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services for years, allowing Mylan to collect more money for its device. \nAs for Impax? \nThe Hayward, Calif.-based drug company acquired the rights to a generic version of Adrenaclick, an epinephrine autoinjector used to treat anaphylaxis and severe allergies, in 2015. \nIn 2016 alone, Impax has been able to grow its market share by about 5%, which its vice president of investor relations, Mark Donohue said in a November interview with TheStreet was better than expected. When he was reached Wednesday, Donohue said the company continued to grow its market share through the end of the year. \nPrices for Impax's autoinjector hover around $200 per two pack according to GoodRx, although the company offers a discount card for customers with insurance to pay a $0 copay on up to three twin packs. \nThere are concerns, though, over the company's slow manufacturing process. Impax puts together its autoinjector together manually. Since there are about twenty pieces, the process takes a bit of time. Further complicating manufacture of the device is the fact that its cartridge comes from a third party company, which can slow the process even more. \n\"We've done a lot on the supply side on building out our process,\" Donohue said by phone Wednesday. \"We've invested a lot of money in our lines.\" \nBack in November Donohue noted that the company isn't actively seeking new customers through marketing in schools like Mylan has done. He said the company doesn't have the manufacturing capacity to do that yet. \n\"We've been able to really improve the efficiency of the operation,\" Donohue said Wednesday. \"Our goal would be able to supply the market as much as we can.\" He declined comment on how accretive to earnings Cigna's move could be. \nCigna officials also could not be reached. \n-- Sarah Pringle contributed to this report.
