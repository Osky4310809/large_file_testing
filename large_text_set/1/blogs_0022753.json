Amy Adams is the woman version of Leonardo DiCaprio. I hope someday she'll break the curse like Leo did\n— Scarlett Johansson (@tasharowmanoff) January 24, 2017 JUST REALIZED AMY ADAMS DIDNT GET NOMINATED WHEN WILL WE RALLY FOR HER OSCAR LIKE YALL DID FOR LEONARDO DICAPRIO\n— lusi (@ilovelusi) January 24, 2017 Amy Adams really is the new Leonardo DiCaprio. I'll wait with you, mahgirl. #IBelieve #JusticeForAmyAdams https://t.co/ovWlTu12Gs \n— Juan Miguel Severo (@TheRainBro) January 24, 2017 Others are pointing out that she was the heart and soul of Arrival — so if it got nominated for Best Picture, why did she get snubbed? I've never liked her, and never found anything remarkable about her acting, but hello, #AmyAdams was the soul of Arrival.\n— Shekhar Iyer (@hedonist_redux) January 24, 2017 Happy for Ruth Negga, sad for my girl Amy Adams - dude, she IS that movie. How does it get nominated without her?\n— Sasha Stone (@AwardsDaily) January 24, 2017 Her fandom is PISSED. RIGHT NOW THE AMY ADAMS / ANNETTE BENING GAYS ARE LIKE... pic.twitter.com/I4O8BkAQq8 \n— Chris Schleicher (@cschleichsrun) January 24, 2017 I guess I knew the world was in bad shape. I just didn't realize it was \"Give Mel Gibson more nominations than Amy Adams\" bad.\n— Trosterstrudel (@Trost_Mike) January 24, 2017 The Amy Adams snub for Arrival is one of the worst snubs of all time. Disgusting. #OscarNoms \n— Denizcan James (@MrFilmkritik) January 24, 2017 At least she’s in Annette Benning and Taraji P. Henson’s flawless company? \"Hey! I just wanted to say--\"\n\"Honey, I've been underrated all my life. Get used to it.\"\n-text between Amy Adams and Annette Bening\n— Louis Virtel (@louisvirtel) January 24, 2017 passengers, doctor strange and suicide squad got nominations, but Amy Adams and Taraji P. Henson didn't pic.twitter.com/uSnUw5PIyp \n— laura (@daisyrdley) January 24, 2017 “No Amy Adams” was seriously trending nationally within seconds. Arrival with 8 nominations, best pic and director and editing and no Amy Adams = scandal\n— Christopher Rosen (@chrisjrosen) January 24, 2017 Isabelle Huppert is amazing but no Amy Adams is absurd. Wow. #OscarNoms \n— Alex Withrow (@shiftingPersona) January 24, 2017 Biggest Oscar SNUB: No AMY ADAMS for Arrival. #Crushed \n— Scott Mantz (@MovieMantz) January 24, 2017 She seems to be the official snub of the year, and we’re totally bummed to see our girl left off the list. Arrival was a meditative, thought-provoking sci-fi flick led by — gasp — a strong and intelligent female lead who, as said above, totally carried the movie. \nSo while we’re totally happy for the rest of the nominees (pulling for Ruth Negga, though Natalie Portman was also great, tbh), we’re also awaiting Adams’ inevitable Oscar win down the line — and hoping she doesn’t have to get mauled by a freaking bear to get it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T17:23:27.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
