Yet Bill O'Brien is back after leading the Texans to the postseason, and a Wild Card win over the Derek Carr-less Oakland Raiders .\nThere is one new notable addition to his staff, and that's in former NFL wide receiver Wes Welker , according to John McClain . He most notably played with the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos , catching passes from Tom Brady and Peyton Manning .\nIt doesn’t seem like Welker’s been wasting time getting involved, either:\nWes Welker is here in Mobile with the #Texans staff. Has been considering coaching opportunities. Played under Bill O'Brien with #Patriots .\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 25, 2017 He last played for the then St. Louis Rams , where he appeared in eight games, catching 13 passes for 102 yards and no touchdowns. \nWelker's ties to O'Brien come from their time in New England, where they both joined in 2007. O'Brien stayed five seasons before leaving to replace Joe Paterno at Penn State. Welker signed with the Broncos in March of 2013 after the Patriots decided to move on after the 2012 season.\nHe, along with Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker made for the league's most dangerous passing attack. They made it to Super Bowl XLVIII before taking a spanking by the Seattle Seahawks .\nWelker had an unfortunate series of concussions over the course of his career, but it’s nice to see him resurfacing in the NFL as an assistant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:20:36.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
