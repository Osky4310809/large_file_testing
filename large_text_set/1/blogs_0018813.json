Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge \nSee more Galaxy S7 photos | See more Galaxy S7 Edge photos \nSamsung did a killer job with their 2015 flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Design-wise, many would say those two phones were close to perfect. The company forwent a plastic design and instead included glass front and back panels with an aluminum frame. They weren’t without their flaws, though. The S6 and S6 Edge didn’t offer expandable storage or removable batteries — two features Samsung has been known to include in all its smartphones for years.\nNow the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have made their way to the masses, and they fix many of the problems the S6 line introduced last year. While they don’t offer removable batteries, Samsung included expandable storage on both handsets in case the 32GB of on-board storage isn’t enough. Samsung mostly stuck to the same design this time around, though they did shrink down the camera bumps on the back and made the devices a little thicker to make room for larger batteries.\nIn terms of specs, these are top-of-the-line smartphones. They come with Quad HD Super AMOLED displays, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processors, 4GB of RAM, great 12MP rear-facing cameras and run the latest version of Android. Instead of featuring the same screen sizes this time around though, Samsung kept the S7 at a smaller 5.1 inches, while the S7 Edge has been bumped up to a larger 5.5-inch panel.\nSeriously, these are some incredible smartphones. They are a little pricey, but all in all, we think the high asking price is worth it.\nSpecs Samsung Galaxy S7 \n5.1-inch Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 577ppi Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 200GB 12MP rear camera, 5MP front camera Non-removable 3000mAh battery Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9mm, 152g Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge \n5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 534ppi Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 200GB 12 MP rear camera, 5MP front camera Non-removable 3600mAh battery Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7mm, 157g Read more Samsung Galaxy S7 review Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review Samsung Galaxy S7 unboxing and first 48 hours Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge unboxing and first 48 hours Samsung Galaxy S7 camera: feature focus Best Galaxy S7 cases Best Galaxy S7 Edge cases HTC 10 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 / Edge vs LG G5 Buy the Galaxy S7 from Amazon Buy the Galaxy S7 Edge from Amazon OnePlus 3T \nSee more OnePlus 3T photos \nWe weren’t expecting OnePlus to release another new flagship in 2016, but it happened. If you were a fan of the OnePlus 3, you’ll certainly love the OnePlus 3T.\nWith its powerful Snapdragon 821 processor backed by 6GB of RAM, the 3T absolutely flies through web browsing, gaming and most other everyday tasks. It also has a bigger battery this time around (3,400mAh to be exact), which is more than enough to get you through a full day of use on a single charge. In addition, the 3T now sports 16MP rear and front-facing camera sensors, a dual-SIM card slot, plenty of on-board storage, and a fast front-facing fingerprint sensor on the front.\nBasically the OnePlus 3T is a better OnePlus 3, and we’re certainly not complaining. You can buy it from OnePlus’ website in Gunmetal and Soft Gold color options.\nSpecs 5.5-inch Optic AMOLED display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 401ppi 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 6GB of RAM 64/128GB of on-board storage, no microSD card expansion 16MP rear camera, 16MP front camera Non-removable 3,400mAh battery Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm, 158g Read more OnePlus 3T review OnePlus 3T announced: Snapdragon 821, 3,400mAh battery, 16MP rear and front cameras OnePlus 3T: pricing and availability Buy now from OnePlus Huawei Mate 9 \nSee more Huawei Mate 9 photos \nHuawei has done a great job at making its way to the mainstream over the past few years – first with the Huawei P9, and now with the Mate 9.\nWith a big 5.9-inch display, powerful Kirin 960 processor, dual-SIM capabilities, and an impressive camera setup, the Mate 9 may be one of the best big phones of the year. While its display is ‘only’ 1080p and its software is a bit odd sometimes, we still think the high price tag is worth it. If you’re after a smartphone that offers exceptional battery life and incredible performance, the standard Mate 9 delivers in spades. If money is no object and you want a smartphone that is unattainable to most customers, the Porsche Design Mate 9 might be worth your while.\nSpecs 5.9-inch IPS LCD display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 373ppi Octa-core Hisilicon Kirin 960 processor 4GB of RAM 64GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 256GB Dual 20 and 12MP rear cameras, 8MP front camera Non-removable 4,000mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 156.9 x 78.9 x 7.9mm, 190g Read more Huawei Mate 9 & Porsche Design Mate 9 review Best Huawei Mate 9 cases Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9 hands-on: the dream machine Huawei Mate 9 vs the competition Huawei Mate 9 officially announced The Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9 is an incredibly expensive Note 7 lookalike Buy now from Amazon ZTE Axon 7 \nSee more ZTE Axon 7 photos \nZTE’s Axon Pro from 2015 was a good phone, but it fell short in a few key areas. It came to market with only one storage option, no expandable memory, and the dual camera setup on the back of the device felt a bit gimmicky. Not only does the company’s latest flagship fix all of those problems, it brings much more to the table.\nIt has a big 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display, the latest Snapdragon processor, plenty of RAM, multiple storage options, and yes, expandable memory up to 256GB. It also sports some killer front-facing speakers, all-day battery life, a great camera, and a sleek, attractive design. While certain parts of the software could use a little more polish, the ZTE Axon 7 goes toe-to-toe with the best in the Android market. It’s also inexpensive at only $400, making this an even more attractive option for folks looking to score a solid flagship device.\nSpecs 5.5-inch AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 538ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4/6GB of RAM 64/128GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 256GB 20MP front camera, 8MP rear camera Non-removable 3250mAh battery Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow 151.7 x 75 x 7.9mm, 175g Read more ZTE Axon 7 review ZTE Axon 7 officially announced ZTE Axon 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 ZTE Axon 7 vs Honor 8 ZTE Axon 7 hands-on and first impressions Buy now from Amazon LG G5 \nSee more LG G5 photos \nWhile the Galaxy S7 series is a minor refresh in terms of design, the LG G5 sees a massive departure from the design language used in the G series, ditching the rear volume/power setup that first debuted with the LG G2. The G5 also adopts a unibody metallic design that has a removable cap for access to the removable battery and a port for modules that allow users to expand the phone’s capabilities by adding a camera grip and other special accessories.\nThe distinctly different design of the LG G5 may not be for everyone, but there’s little denying that LG has went out of its way to try and innovate in a market where big changes like this aren’t all that common.\nSpec wise, we’re looking at a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 with 4 GB RAM, a 5.3-inch display, and 32 GB storage with microSD for expansion. The specs here are certainly impressive all across the board. It’s also worth mentioning that LG has revamped its software, making it faster and less bloated. One controversial move with the software, however, is the removal of the app drawer in favor of what LG says is a “simplified experience.”\nSpecs 5.3-inch IPS LCD display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 554ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4GB of RAM 32GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 200GB 16 and 8MP dual rear cameras, 8MP front camera Removable 2800 mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7mm, 159g Read more LG G5 review Best LG G5 cases LG G5: specs, features, price and availability LG G5 vs iPhone 6s Moto Z Force vs LG G5 LG G5 vs LG V10 LG G5 vs LG G4 Buy now from Amazon Motorola Moto Z Play \nSee more Moto Z Play photos \nIf you’re looking for a smartphone with insane battery life, a good camera and a modular design, Lenovo’s Moto Z Play might be the phone for you. \nThe standout feature on this phone is its big 3,510mAh battery, which really impressed us in our full review . \nOne reason why the Moto Z Play has such good battery life is the sensible spec sheet – you get a 5.5-inch Full HD display and a Snapdragon 625 processor, compared to the more power intensive Quad HD/Snapdragon 820 found on the Moto Z and Z Force. You also get 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage space, which is expandable up to 256GB. It won’t yield the best performance, but that’s not really the point of this phone. \nIt’s not the cheapest phone out there, but it does mow down the competition in certain areas. \nSpecs 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 403ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor 3GB of RAM 32GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 256GB 16MP rear camera, 5MP front camera Non-removable 3510mAh battery Android 6.0 Marshmallow 156.4 x 76.4 x 7mm, 164g Read more Moto Z Play (Droid) review Moto Z Play and new Hasselblad Mod with 10X optical zoom announced Unlocked Moto Z Play now available from Amazon, Best Buy and B&H Buy now from Amazon Motorola Moto G4 Plus \nSee more Moto G4 Plus photos \nInstead of announcing just one Moto G variant this year, Lenovo brought us three different devices – the Moto G4 Plus, Moto G4 and Moto G4 Play.\nThe highest-end of the bunch is the Moto G4 Plus, and it brings a handful of notable improvements to the Moto G range. It has a big 1080p display, capable processor, expandable storage, and even a fingerprint sensor this time around. While we had a slight problem with the volume/power buttons and the camera in low light, we can honestly say this is one of the best budget offerings in 2016.\nRight now you can buy it in the U.S. for $249.99 through Amazon or Motorola.com .\nSpecs 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 401ppi Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor 2/3/4GB of RAM 16/32/64GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 256GB 16MP rear camera, 5MP front camera Non-removable 3000mAh battery Android 6.0 Marshmallow 153 x 76.6 x 9.8mm, 155g Read more Motorola Moto G4 Plus review Hands-on with the Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus officially announced Buy now from Motorola So there you have it – our picks for the best dual-SIM options Android has to offer at the moment.
