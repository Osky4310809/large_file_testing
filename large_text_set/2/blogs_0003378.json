The Mughal Garden will now have two new varieties of roses named ‘President Pranab’ and ‘Suvra Mukherjee’. \nThese two varieties were developed by Prabir Kumar Maity and Ashok Kumar Maity of Pushpanjali Rose Nursery at Jakpur, West Bengal.

About 14,000 Tulip bulbs in seven different colors such as red, orange, pink, and purple have been planted in the Mughal Gardens. Several beds of roses, including both new and heritage varieties are the main attraction of the Long garden. \nYou may also want to watch: \n\nFlower Carpets in various designs will be on display in the Central Lawns of the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Exhibition Stalls will be set up near the Spiritual Garden displaying produce of fresh vegetables and fruits grown in the President’s Estate Organic Farm. The Spiritual Garden will also showcase a Lotus pond with a cascading waterfall. \nThe Mughal Gardens will remain open for general public from February 05 to March 12, 2017 (except on Mondays which are maintenance days) between 09:30 A.M. to 04:00 P.M.
