Revenues dropped 14.8 percent in the third quarter of 2016. And now, an analyst is reporting that Chipotle could very well bear the brunt of President Trump’s announcement that he may impose a 20 percent tariff on Mexican goods entering the US to fund the wall he’d like to build to attempt to keep out illegal Mexican immigrants. \nInstinet analyst Mark Kalinowski said he believes Chipotle gets around 70 million pounds of the 99 million pounds of avocados it uses each year from Mexico. A price increase thanks to a tariff would be problematic for the chain, to say the least. \nAnd it’s not just Mexican avocados that could put economic pressures on the chain. Kalinowski wrote in a note published Tuesday, “Our belief is that the company generally obtains about 70-90 percent of its avocados from Mexico, all of its limes, the majority of its jalapeño, less than half of its tomatoes, and small amounts of other items (e.g., cilantro).” READ MORE: Trump’s Mexico Tariff Would Be Very Bad News for Americans Who Like Food, Alcohol \nBottom line: “Should a 20 percent tariff be enacted for goods imported from Mexico, Chipotle likely would bear the biggest brunt of this potential impact on food costs compared to the other companies we cover.” \nTrump has said that a border tax is just one of the options he is exploring to fund his promised wall. Because of how the tax would affect food costs, many stateside food retailers are hoping that the President will drop the tariff. Previously, he insisted that Mexico would pay for the construction of the wall, but Mexico’s president fired back by clarifying that there was no such plan and then cancelling a meeting with Trump last week. \nMUNCHIES reached out to Chipotle for comment, and received the following statement: “Any impacts or projections stemming from this tax are purely speculative as this tariff is nothing more than a proposal. There are a host of variables that can impact upon food costs (weather, supply and demand, and public policy decisions, among others). If any events impact our food costs in material ways, we’ll make that information available in a timely fashion, but we’re not going to speculate about what any of these events might mean.” \nIs the priest from The Exorcist available?
