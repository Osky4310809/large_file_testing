Not only are some cars ( like the ones in Mad Max: Fury Road ) made to such exacting standards that they actually perform all the outrageous functions that you’d see in the movie, but they’re built by engineering firms that are filled to the brim with car lovers. \n\nThis ‘67 GTO, at least on its face, seems to be no exception. The jury’s currently out on reviews of the movie, but I’d wager to guess it’s the same entertaining, schlocky, B-movie-plot-with-A-list talent we’re apt to see dominate the box office in late January. \nAdvertisement \n\nHaving said that, I’m glad to know that this Pontiac GTO was chosen as the movie’s lead car, as it was likely picked by a gang of writers then approved by a movie studio as the one that correlates its badass virtues best to a worldwide audience.\nThis particular car was built by Eddie Paul Customs and John Frazier Special Effects, and it was used during scenes where practical effects were used to depict a flamethrower shooting out of the car’s hood scoop. I’m willing to bet this option will be disabled for renters, however I fantasize that it isn’t. \n\nThe GTO is powered by a 335 horsepower, 400 cubic inch V8 engine, mated to a TH400 automatic with a B&M shifter, which is pretty standard fare as far as muscle cars go. The devil lies in the bodywork details, and there are indeed many to note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:17:59.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
