At 21, detained after an Isis counter-attack on the Kurdish city of Kirkuk in October 2016, he was so strong he “snapped the plastic handcuffs off his wrists,” a Kurdish counter terrorism agent told Reuters, after granting the news organisation a rare interview with an incarcerated fighter. \nAround 100 civilians and members of the security forces died in the October attack, launched as revenge for the ongoing US-backed coalition efforts to drive Isis from their stronghold of Mosul.

Survivors’ stories documented by rights groups are chilling. \nKurdish security officials, while they did not confirm the details of Hussein’s story, said they did have evidence that he had committed rape and murder, but did not know the scale of his crimes. \nHussein said he also killed about 500 people since joining Isis in 2013.
