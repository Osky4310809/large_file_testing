BARCELONA INJURIES \nAleix Vidal is sidelined for the remainder of the season after suffering a horrific ankle injury at Alaves last month. \nJeremy Mathieu is also been out injured, but Neymar, who starred against PSG, returns after missing the 2-1 defeat away to Deportivo La Coruna last weekend. BARCELONA SUSPENSIONS \nBarcelona boss Luis Enrique has an otherwise full-strength squad to choose from on Sunday. However, both Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique are just one yellow card away from picking up a one-match ban. BARCELONA POTENTIAL STARTING LINE-UP \nBarcelona boss Luis Enrique is set to stick with 3-4-3 following the success of the formation in recent weeks. \nThe Asturian coach welcomes back Neymar after the Brazilian missed the 2-1 defeat at Deportivo La Coruna last weekend through injury. He will start along with international team-mate Rafinha in attack alongside Luis Suarez, with Messi in a deeper role. \nSamuel Umtiti will return in defence alongside Gerard Pique and Javier Mascherano. VALENCIA TEAM NEWS \nValencia are down in 13th place in La Liga and the stricken side have won just three games away from home in the Primera Division all season. \nVoro's men lost 3-0 at Atletico Madrid in their last match away from Mestalla, but they sit 11 points clear of the drop zone and should be safe from relegation despite their poor form this season. \nEnzo Perez returns from suspension and should start at Camp Nou. Voro has no major injury concerns for the trip to Barcelona. BEST OPTA MATCH FACTS \nBarcelona have only lost two of their last 19 league games against Valencia (won 12, drawn five), both at Camp Nou (a 2-1 defeat in 2015-2016 and a 3-2 loss in 2013-2014). \nLuis Enrique's side has won their last six league games at Camp Nou, scoring 4.1 goals per game. \nLuis Suarez has scored seven goals in his last five games against Valencia in all competitions, including his first four-goal haul for Barcelona. \nLionel Messi has scored more goals against Diego Alves than versus any other goalkeeper in his career at Barcelona (19 in all competitions). \nBarcelona are the only La Liga side to have not had a player sent off in the Primera Division this season. TV COVERAGE & KICK-OFF TIME \nBarcelona versus Valencia kicks off at 20:45 CET at Camp Nou on Sunday and will be shown live in the UK on Sky Sports 2 from 19:30 GMT.
