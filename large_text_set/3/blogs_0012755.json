He got Milwaukee’s Nate Orf to fly out on a 95 mph fastball. Holland struck out Gabriel Noriega on an 84 mph slider. And Holland got Ryan Cordell to fly out after two 75 mph curveballs. \nHolland, a two-time all-star, once an elite, shutdown closer for Kansas City, moved right along. He was the winning pitcher in the Rockies’ 5-4 come-from-behind victory. Midspring caveats aside, Holland cleared a major hurdle toward regaining his form. He could not hide the emotion. \n“I’ve been trying to do that for years,” the 31-year-old Holland said. “It’s a game, it’s fun, but it’s nerve-racking at times. A lot of people look like they’re not emotionally invested in the game. I try not to look that way. But I am.” \nNed Yost, Holland’s manager at Kansas City, called him one of the two best closers he has ever seen. In 2014, Holland recorded a 1.21 ERA, and in 2015 it was 1.44 ERA. He struck out two of every five batters he faced over those two seasons. And Holland was about to pitch in a World Series before his right elbow wore down to the point of surgery. \n“It was barely holding on,” Yost said of Holland’s elbow. “He wanted to pitch until it blew. That’s his mentality. He’s tough as nails.” \nThe Rockies in January signed Holland to a one-year, $7 million contract that is heavy on performance bonuses. Colorado was desperate for help to pair with Adam Ottavino on the back end of the bullpen. And Holland was eager for an opportunity to prove his arm was still attached enough to succeed. \n“When you’re coming back from injury and it’s been awhile since you’ve been in a game, you get pumped up,” Colorado manager Bud Black said. “We’re still looking at the big picture. But he’s crossed some bridges here in Arizona. He’s feeling good physically. And mentally, he’s in a good spot.” \nHolland on Wednesday threw to minor-league catcher Jan Vazquez, who visited him briefly on the mound before the ninth. Holland told him he wanted a varied pitch mix: one, two and three for fastball, curveball, slider. Vazquez understood. He told Holland, “Let’s go get ’em.” \nThe inning flew by. But the season will wait. Holland’s health will get a look-see Thursday to check his muscle strength. He will not pitch again before Saturday at the earliest. But the plan is to pitch in six to eight more spring games. Holland is on schedule for Colorado’s opening-day roster, Black said. \n“Weirdly enough, I enjoy being in bad situations sometimes,” Holland said. “That’s the fun of it. I try to look even-keel. But I’m excited.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T06:01:54.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
