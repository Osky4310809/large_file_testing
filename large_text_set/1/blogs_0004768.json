(Facebook) \n(AP) – A spokesperson for President Obama has condemned the now-infamous Facebook video that emanated from Chicago showing a mentally changed teen beaten by four captors. \nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest says the torture video demonstrates “a level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans.” \nEarnest says he had not yet spoken to President Barack Obama about the incident in the president’s hometown but says he’s confident Obama “would be angered by the images that are depicted on that video.” \nCook County prosecutors have filed hate crime and aggravated kidnapping and battery charges against four black suspects in the incident that police say went on for as many as 48 hours. \n(© 2017 The Associated Press.
