He looked to the street below and saw two men struggling alongside a car that was rolling, as if it was set in neutral. \nChung, 37, ran downstairs. On the way, he heard the gunshot. \nThat shot ended the life of a man who had traveled to St. Louis with his wife to visit their daughter and her newborn baby, neighbors say. The fatal shooting on the 3800 block of Juniata Street — one of three in St. Louis Friday night — has shaken to its core Chung’s Tower Grove South neighborhood of tidy brick homes and well-kept front yards two blocks from the park. \n“St. Louis is a city full of murders,” lamented resident Richard Buthod, who stood with a crowd of neighbors late Sunday in a subdued candlelight vigil for the victim and a show of support for their neighborhood. “I do not understand the violence.” \nPolice had released few details by Sunday night, only that the victim was a man in his 60s and had been fatally shot in the neck. It appears he was killed during either an attempted robbery or attempted carjacking involving two men, one on foot and one in a car. \nAt the time Chung looked, he said, the assailant on foot was trying to escape and the victim was grabbing him by the arm, calling for help to prevent him from getting away, as his gray BMW 3281 rolled into a neighbor’s car. \nChung heard but didn’t see the gunshot. The victim’s wife told him a car had pulled up and the person in it fired, hitting the victim in the throat. \n“When I opened the front door the victim’s wife said he had been shot. I ran and got a clean kitchen towel to put on the wound to stop the bleeding,” Chung said as he sat in his front room with his wife, Saras, 35. “He was falling and stumbling down and I caught his head and saw the gunshot wound and applied pressure to it. He was just trying to breathe.” \nThe wounded man’s wife was on her cellphone talking to a 911 dispatcher as other neighbors started coming out of their homes. The dispatcher gave directions to Chung to conduct CPR on the man. Chung attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while another man held the victim’s nose and Chung’s wife applied chest compression. \n“I tried to give him mouth-to-mouth but he was at a bad angle on the steps and I just didn’t want to move him,” Chung said. “. . . He was already fading.” \nParamedics arrived and continued the CPR as they transported him away. The Chungs later were told he had died before being taken away. +2 \nA candlelight vigil was held on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017, at the corner of Juniata Street and Gustine Avenue, for a man who was shot and killed on Juniata on Friday.

Forbes, \nChung said the neighborhood has come together and provided meals for the family. “There’s never just one victim,” his wife said. She said neighbors are afraid for their safety. \nAbout 100 neighbors gathered on the street Sunday night for a short candlelight vigil, to show the family of the victim “our shared pain,” as Buthod put it. \nAnother area resident, Debra Knox Deiermann, said the gathering doubled as “a public display of support for the neighborhood,” which she said has seen a noticeable uptick in robberies and carjackings recently. \n“We had a neighbor come over to watch the election returns last November, and on our front porch, which was well-lit, she had a gun put in her face,” Deiermann said. The assailant took the woman’s bag and ran, shooting twice in the air, she said. \n“This is a nice neighborhood. For years, it has been a beautiful place to live, with wonderful neighbors, and it still is,” Deiermann said. “We just have to do something about the crime.” \nBarbara Gilchrist, president of the Tower Grove Heights Neighborhood Association and an organizer of the vigil, told the crowd the tragedy was worsened for happening during “what should have been a joyous occasion,” a couple’s visit to their new grandchild. She urged them to be “the embodiment of love for our neighbors” in the face of rising crime. \n“It’s horrifying,” she said. “Horrifying.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:14:12.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
