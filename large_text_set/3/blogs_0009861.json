ET caught up with the Flip or Flop star at the All-Star Chef Classic at L.A. Live on Saturday, where she opened up about her and her ex's now-amicable relationship. WATCH: Tarek and Christina El Moussa Share Behind-the-Scenes Pics From Set, Prove They're Amicable \"Honestly, I'm doing really good. I'm in a really good place,\" Christina told ET's Lauren Zima. \"The kids are happy, they're healthy, Tarek and I are in a good spot. We have a lot of things that we're working on, cool things coming in the future, so we're just looking forward.\" The pair, who share two kids, 6-year-old daughter Taylor and 1-year-old son Brayden, are currently filming season seven of their popular HGTV show, and Christina says everything's going \"really good.\" A post shared by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on Mar 9, 2017 at 6:44am PST \"We have an amazing crew, they are like the funest, funniest guys, and they just keep everything super upbeat and light,\" she gushed. \"Tarek and I have worked together for 10 years, and we're going to continue to work together. We're getting along really, really well right now.\" \"I think honestly it's just like letting go of past resentment and living in the future, and remembering that kids are the priority,\" she added. \"And we are going to be in each other's lives for forever, so we just decided to put the past in the past and move on.\" A post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa) on Mar 2, 2017 at 3:48pm PST WATCH: Tarek El Moussa Says Fame, Bad Communication Is Responsible for Divorce From Christina Christina tells ET she and Tarek are very communicative with each other, especially when it comes to co-parenting. \"We both travel a lot, so we're very flexible with our schedules,\" she explained. \"We both put the kids first we just decided to really get on the same page and both make sure we're doing the best we can.\" \"For sure 100% my children,\" she added, when asked how she's staying so positive amid divorce. \"They are the biggest joy in my life and they are just happy fun amazing kids.\" But she admitted it certainly wasn't easy breaking the news to them. \"I think when we first told Taylor we were not getting back together, that we're going to be living apart, that was tough,\" she said. \"It took a few months to get to where we are now, but I'm not going to lie, that was difficult.\" A post shared by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on Mar 11, 2017 at 12:48pm PST WATCH: Tarek and Christina El Moussa Are in Good Spirits While Filming 'Flip or Flop' Together In addition to raising her kids and filming Flip or Flop , Christina is also in the process of writing a book, a project she started as a coping mechanism. \"Going through a divorce is tough on anyone, so I'm just kind of writing about some of the experiences that I've had and things that have really helped me cope, and just hoping I can help people going through similar situations,\" she said. \"Putting the kids first and recognizing the fact that we need to be happy, healthy, wonderful parents [has helped me cope. Other things that have helped me a lot is -- I've found yoga, and yoga has really helped me relieve a lot of stress and really helped me think that I have control over my emotions and just really find peace.\" Christina adds that following the split, she and Tarek surprisingly didn't receive much backlash from viewers. In fact, \"the majority 99%\" has been very positive. \"People grew up with our family,\" she said. \"They just want what's best for us. I've had a lot of outreach, a lot of very positive messages from people that have been in similar circumstances and, you know, just-- they are keeping us in their thoughts and prayers which has helped a lot.\" \"[Rumors] are totally not on my radar at all anymore,\" she continued. \"I don't even read [them]. It is what it is. It really hasn't affected my life.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:10:08.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
