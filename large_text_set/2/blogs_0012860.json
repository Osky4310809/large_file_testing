I think it’s a couple of years since I last played at Anfield,\" he said.

I’m so excited, I can’t wait for it. \n“ I’m often asked the question what was the best buzz during your career and it was always running out at Anfield with the Liverpool shirt on in front of a full house.

For myself and all the other players it’s the reason why we are doing it. It’s a great fixture but the key to all this is that we raise some funds, it stays in the local areas and it goes back to less fortunate people.” \nGerrard will be joined by the likes of Jamie Carragher, Robbie Fowler and Ian Rush for the legends match. poll loading Will Steven Gerrard manage Liverpool one day? 3000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:21:49.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
