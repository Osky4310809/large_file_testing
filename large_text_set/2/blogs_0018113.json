The new book Star Wars Aftermath: Empire’s End might give us some new information on the inexplicable power behind the First Order. Hit the jump to learn more about how Empire’s End may reveal Snoke’s origins.\n\n\nChuck Wendig’s Star Wars Aftermath: Empire’s End book was released in stores today ( you can buy it now for around $17 on Amazon ), and the following bit of speculation is derived from information in that book. So if you don’t want to be spoiled on that novel, now is your chance to click away.\n\nThe nice guys at Star Wars Explained posted the above video which relays the following information.\nThe Aftermath book series seems to have been slowly releasing information about Supreme Leader Snoke’s backstory.\nIn the first book, Star Wars: Aftermatch, one of the Emperor’s advisors Yupe Tashu says that Palpatine believed the power of the dark side came from somewhere in the Unknown Regions. Laboratories and communication stations were constructed at the edges of the galaxy seeking the source of the dark side. In the second book of the Aftermath series, Aftermath: Life Debt, we were told that one of those stations was on Jakku, but it wasn’t constructed and instead found and unburied. In the third and final book in the series, Aftermath: Empire’s End, we discover that the station on Jakku was originally part of a contingency plan should the Emperor ever fall but later became an obsession of the Sith master. It housed ancient computers used to chart the Unknown Regions. Palpatine spent decades sending beacons, droids, men, and women into uncharted space looking for the source of the dark side, and most of them were lost in the journey. Sometime before the Battle of Endor (at the end of Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi), navigational coordinates were established that supposedly led deep into the Unknown territory, possibly even into an entirely new galaxy.\nIn the instance of his death, The Emperor wanted to destroy the Empire that failed to protect him; this was originally the purpose of the information on the buried Jakku station. The coordinates would supposedly allow a select few of the Emperor’s loyal followers to venture into a new galaxy to start anew.\n\nBut something happened. Palpatine began receiving a signal from the area, something only he could feel that even his apprentice Darth Vader didn’t have the power to sense. Palpatine became convinced that something out there was calling to him from the deep unknown. Maybe it could be the origin of the Force, or some darker malevolent substance. The Emperor wanted to take an expedition to the coordinates but was killed before he could make the journey. Palpatine was not the only being to receive visions of the dark side, as the book revealed that every member of the group known as the Acolytes of the Beyond began having dreams and visions of Sith, both ancient and recent.\nStar Wars Explained theorizes that the Empire’s exploration into the Unknown Regions awoke something ancient and powerful, most possibly Supreme Leader Snoke. That a being found the literal source of the dark side and had chosen to stay there, somewhere, perhaps in an entirely different galaxy. If that is the case, why did Snoke begin to send visions to particular beings?\n\nThe novelization for Star Wars: The Force Awakens mentioned that Snoke watched the Empire rise and fall. So if he was out there this whole time watching, what caused him to reach out? Did he see the incoming threat to the dark side of the Force? With the introduction of Luke Skywalker to Obi-Wan Kenobi, maybe he foresaw the danger the young Jedi would bring to the dark side of the force? Perhaps that’s why he didn’t send visions to Luke’s father, Darth Vader.\nSo what do you think? Is the Aftermath book series teasing us with some details of Snoke’s origins or is this all leading to something else entirely. Recently, I’ve become very disillusioned with the connectivity of the new Star Wars. It was once pitched that the story would be told over multiple platforms, but so far I don’t feel fans have been rewarded from many of the ancillary story connections. For the most part, the books, games and tv shows tend to fill in the details after the fact rather than hint or set up details for future movies.\nSo it’s my cynical position that this backstory is setting up something that will be explored in future books, something that we will likely not see in the movies at all. And if that is the case, I think fans will be extremely disappointed.\nThe post Snoke’s Origins Revealed In New ‘Star Wars’ Book? appeared first on /Film .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:04:30.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
