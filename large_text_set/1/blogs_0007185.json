When it becomes unclassified. Documents are marked classified for a reason. https://t.co/n78QF9xGmd \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 6, 2017 You routinely treated leaked reports abt Clinton as fact. Now bad report for Trump emerges & your concern is leaks. https://t.co/BlQgs8SaYJ \n— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) January 6, 2017 Trump is dead wrong on Russia and I've always said it. What you state here is misleading at best. A lie at worst.

Joe, so did you go to @realDonaldTrump s New Year's Eve party or not? Is lying \"repulsive\"? https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 Joe, you say you are a \"real conservative\"! Was NBC's coverage of the election last year \"repulsive\" to you? Are you proud of MSNBC? https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 So Mr \"repulsive Joe\" why didn't NBC go interview @wikileaks ? By the way at Fox (where u want to work) we let the audience decide!!! https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 The only thing that is really \"repulsive\" is you calling yourself a \"conservative\". You are the poster child for \"establishment\". https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 Ok enough for now \"Repulsive Joe\". I have my radio show to do. How is your radio show doing? https://t.co/jQ6FEjH8gJ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 6, 2017 \nPHEW! \nI’m not so sure Hannity can call himself a conservative anymore at this point, though. That ship sailed long before he recently interviewed Julian Assange – a man he claimed back in 2010 should’ve been arrested for doing exactly what he did in 2016. \nRepublican, sure. \nHowever, Hannity went for the jugular on a number of occasions and for that reason alone he wins this round of Commentators Gone Wild .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T04:57:37.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
