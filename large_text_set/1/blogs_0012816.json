Anthony Beminio, who were shot and killed separately in a related ambush in November . \nWhile there, Wahlberg also attended a special “invite only” screening of his new movie “Patriots Day,” which chronicled the actions of first responders in Boston following the 2013 terrorist attack on the famous marathon. \n“’Patriots Day’ is a tribute to law enforcement and anyone who commits to serving their community and country,” Wahlberg explained of the message behind the film, set to be released nationwide on Friday. \nWhile Mark Wahlberg has always stood out from the rest of the Hollywood crowd, he certainly distinguished himself from the whiny liberals in the aftermath of Trump’s election, when he scolded them for getting involved in politics and informed them that the general public really didn’t care about their political opinions and only wants to watch them perform. \nPerhaps Rosie O’Donnell could take a lesson from Wahlberg, both in understanding that her opinion carries no more weight than anyone else’s, and in how to treat the men and women who place their lives on the line to protect the nation and their community, who most certainly DO NOT want to be called out to impose martial law against the inauguration of the next president. \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter so everyone can see the major difference between two Hollywood celebrities.
