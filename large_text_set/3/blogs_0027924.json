Investment decision is out of our hands and we'll know in next few weeks. Coach appointment going well but can't announce yet. — Stephen Vaughan (@StevieV1874) March 21, 2017 \nThat could be seen as further indication that Gloucester are close to securing the services of Ackermann. \nAnd listening to Ackermann talk after the Lions’ 44-14 win over the Reds last Saturday, it would not come as a surprise if he was to leave Johannesburg. \n\"The whole decision is quite tough,\" Ackermann said. \n\"The question for me is, where do I see my next challenge? Do I want to coach another three or four Super Rugby seasons and believe that that will be the best for me as a coach? Or is it time to go and test myself in Europe or at a Premiership level and grow as a coach there? \n\"There is so much more to it than that. Your children are at school, your wife is happy, your friends are here, the people that you love, your culture, your language… it's a rugby decision but it's also an emotional decision. \n\"It's probably the best time to go if you want to go because they (Gloucester) aren't doing as well as they would like, but that's not to say that I'm going to be the ones to change it. Time will tell.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T12:43:38.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
