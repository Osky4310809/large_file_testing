It’s probably the thing he does best. Here’s how to make it at home. Advertisement \nIn this video, YouTube chef Andrew Rea shows you how to make a chili recipe that’s been passed down the Malone bloodline for generations. In case you’re unfamiliar with the source material, the character describes how he makes his famous chili as he spills it all over the office carpet . It’s quite tragic, but it’s also one of the characters most memorable moments. \nTo make the chili yourself, you’ll need some dried ancho chiles (toasting them yourself is optional,) and some dried cascabel chiles to even out the flavor. You’ll also need some chicken stock, jalapenos, chopped tomatoes, garlic for pressing, and some onions for under-cooking. Just follow along and you’ll have a killer batch of chili in no time. As a joke, Rea serves the chili on a piece of carpet, but I’d recommend using a bowl. You can find the complete ingredient list at the link below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T01:05:41.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
