A new DC TV show is coming, and we’ll know more soon. Plus, Michael Fassbender talks Alien: Covenant , and new footage from Beauty and The Beast . To me, my spoilers!\n\n\nThor: Ragnarok A synopsis released through D23 , Disney’s official fan club, officially confirms that Doctor Strange will appear in the movie\nAdvertisement \n\nThor: Ragnarok in November brings together Thor, the Hulk, and Doctor Strange to face off against intergalactic baddies both familiar and new.\nWhile we’ve heard rumblings about Doctor Strange’s presence in Ragnarok for a while—and of course, his own movie’s post credit scene teased future interactions between the sorcerer and Thor. But his name being lobbed in here along Thor and Hulk like this seems to imply that Strange has much more than just a minor cameo role in the movie. [ Coming Soon ]\nAnimated Spider-Man (Movie) Comic Book Movie spotted a since-removed a casting call Backstage.com for a Sony Animation movie codenamed Cabin Fever that could possibly be the animated Spider-Man feature, including two characters named “Terrence” and “Pete” who sound an awful lot like they could be casting calls for Ultimate Spider-Man Miles Morales and his best friend Ganke.\nAdvertisement \n\n“Terrence” is described as “a young African-American/Puerto Rican teen from Brooklyn; he is new to this suburban school and now feeling out of place, overwhelmed, pressured with new responsibilities, and dealing with puberty; while trying to fit in he must do his best to stay out of trouble; along the way in developing his identity he’s losing old friends but now making a new one, Pete.” Meanwhile, “Pete” is described as, “a young, slightly geeky, Asian-American teen; he’s smart, sweet, and encouraging; although very unlike any of the friends Terrence had in his old Brooklyn neighborhood, Pete proves to be a good fit for Terrence making good decisions.”\nThe movie could turn out to be a different project altogether, so keep this firmly in the speculation category for now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T16:17:18.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
