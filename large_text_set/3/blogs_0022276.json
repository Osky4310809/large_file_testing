We’ve previously seen a leaked image of what was claimed to be a Galaxy S8 Plus battery cell which was of the reported 3,500mAh capacity . A couple of images have been leaked online today likely confirming the concerning possibility that these are the battery capacities that Samsung is sticking with. \nThe battery packs that we see in these images are said to be for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. The marking show that they are of 3,000mAh and 3,500mAh capacity respectively. The markings also reveal that the cell has been made in Korea and the battery itself has been assembled in Vietnam by Samsung SDI. \nMany have expressed concerns that the battery capacity simply may not be enough for these devices so either Samsung has made impressive gains elsewhere to reduce battery consumption or we’re about to see a repeat of the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge . Samsung will officially confirm these details about the Galaxy S8 on March 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:04:16.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
