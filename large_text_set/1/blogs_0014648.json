In the first round of the Australian Open, she still managed to do it. \nIn her shock run into the fourth round last year Gavrilova took out two seeds — Petra Kvitova and Kristina Mladenovic — but none of them were as imposing physically as her first round opponent this time, big-serving Briton Naomi Broady. \nGavrilova’s size belies her enormous heart. The Russian-born 22-year-old couldn’t have chosen a better adopted country to call home. Aussies love an underdog and simply because of her height Gavrilova will always appear to be one, no matter her skill and ability. \nRACQUET SMASH SAVES YOUNG GUN \nThen there’s how hard she fights in matches. On her run into the fourth round in 2016 many compared Gavrilova to Lleyton Hewitt who wasn’t born with obvious physical gifts and yet made the most of what he had to produce an exceptional career. \nBut where Gavrilova already arguably differs from Hewitt is attitude at a young age. After her fourth round loss in 2016, Gavrilova was introspective; she called herself a brat and recognised that acting up and being upset when things didn’t go her way weren’t going to make things any better. \n“(Last year) I was a troublemaker,” she said post-match on Tuesday night. \n“I wouldn’t listen to my coaches sometimes and I would whinge. I said to myself ‘it really is up to me if I want to help myself’.” \nSo while it has only been one match, Gavrilova says she is already feeling the difference on court thanks to her different mindset.

Surely it’s going to pay off,” she said. \n“Yeah, after the match, I was joking around. I said, I’m a grown-up woman now.” \nGiving up almost a foot to Broady — and probability of success on Broady’s first serve because of it — but making up for it in pace and determination, Gavrilova clawed her way back from a lost first set to tie things up at a set apiece. \nThe third set was tense, tight and with a parochial crowd behind her; just as she likes it. Down 30-40 at 6-5 in the third set, Gavrilova then won three straight points, seemingly with ice in her veins on her sole match point opportunity — the only one she would end up needing. \nShe joked after the match on-court that she couldn’t win a match in less than two hours; but there was a serious point to that comment based on her natural style. \n“I’m someone who’s always going to have tough matches because I can’t just blow someone off the court,” Gavrilova said. \n“I don’t have a big serve, like, huge forehand or backhand. I think all my matches are going to be tough.” \nThat’s certainly not a bad thing for fans who enjoy her thrilling matches. And thankfully for Dasha, she has the fighting spirit to win them.
