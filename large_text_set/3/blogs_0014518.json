The smartwatches are currently already on sale in the US, and it looks like they might become available in Canada soon.\nThe LG Watch Style is already listed on Google’s online store in Canada, but you can’t buy it just yet. For now, all you can do is join the waiting list and once the device goes on sale, you’ll be notified by email. There’s currently no word on when exactly that might happen, but based on the fact that the smartwatch is already listed on the website, you probably won’t have to wait for much longer.\nUnfortunately, the LG Watch Sport hasn’t made its way to the Canadian Google Store yet, which is a bit surprising. Nevertheless, it will probably start selling around the same time as the Style model in Canada.\nSee also: LG Watch Sport and Watch Style review 3 weeks ago As a refresher, the LG G Watch Style is equipped with a 1.2-inch P-OLED screen with a resolution of 360 x 360 pixels. You’ll find the Snapdragon Wear 2100 under the hood along with 512MB of RAM. The smartwatch also features 4GB of storage, a 240mAh battery, and is IP67 rated. It comes in Silver, Titanium, and Rose Gold and ships with Android Wear 2.0 on board.\nGoogle hasn’t mentioned how much the watch, which starts at $249 in the US, will retail for in Canada. The exact pricing will be available at launch.
