Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!” I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!

Journalists from other outlets, including Time magazine and the Associated Press, boycotted the briefing to protest the exclusion of other media. \nThe White House Correspondents’ Association tweeted about the situation , “The WHCA board is protesting strongly against how today’s gaggle is being handled by the White House.” \nOn Thursday at CPAC, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon damned the media for how it “portrayed the campaign, how they portrayed the transition and now they’re portraying the administration.” \nTrump continued his habit of echoing Bannon’s rhetoric when it comes to dealing with the media, which Bannon calls the “opposition party” on a regular basis, when he delivered his own speech at the event. \nTrump said that the “dishonest” media claims the administration can’t criticize coverage because of the First Amendment. \n“I love the First Amendment. Nobody loves it better than me. Nobody. Who uses it more than I do? But the First Amendment gives all of us, it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans the right to speak our minds freely,” Trump said. “It gives you the right, and me the right, to criticize fake news.” \nMore to come… 9 Comedians Who Could Host Trump's White House Correspondents' Dinner (Photos) \nThe White House Correspondents' Association will hold its annual dinner on April 29 at the Washington Hilton, but after President Trump had a hard time finding talent for his inauguration – who will host the event? \nSeth Meyers, Stephen Colbert, Larry Wilmore, Joel McHale, Conan O’Brien and Cecily Strong are among the liberal comedians that have hosted the event in recent years. So Who will be open to hosting during Trump's presidency? Getty Images \nJeff Ross \nThe roast master recently told TMZ that it would be his “patriotic duty” to emcee the event, saying, “It would be the greatest show ever.” TBS \nJay Leno \nLeno has already hosted the dinner three times but appears to be the type of comic who wouldn’t discriminate against Trump if he’s asked to host for a fourth time. NBC \nGreg Gutfeld \nThe Fox News personality and political satirist isn't a typical comedian but Trump isn't a typical president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:41:22.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
