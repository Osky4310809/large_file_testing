We have a clear manifesto commitment. there is no need to take huge tracts of land out of the green belt to solve the housing crisis,” he told ITV1’s Peston on Sunday.

The plans are expected to signal an end to the Tory crusade of mass home ownership (Photo: PA) \nIt will include proposals to amend planning rules to enable councils to plan for more build-to-rent-properties as well as measures to ensure more secure, longer term tenancies are available in the private rented sector.

At the moment we are far too dependent on a small number of large developers building our homes. \n“We need to get more people involved in building homes and more different kinds of tenure - for outright ownership for shared ownership, for renting.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T18:29:29.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
