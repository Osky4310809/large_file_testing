From playing at Outside Lands for the first time to their love of San Francisco. Media: Kat Duncan \nIn June, the band will set off on a mostly national tour (one date will be played in Toronto, Canada) with Silversun Pickups and Ocean Park Standoff, beginning in Miami, Florida, and wrapping at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley on July, 23. At each date, the band will perform their debut album in its entirety as an homage to their roots. \n\"We are all about fostering a feeling of aliveness and connection,\" says front man Stephan Jenkins in a press release. \"That's why we have the summer vibes, because our heat comes from being alive and in the moment and you can only get it when you are willing to keep it real. No one can create the vibes we do fronting over a backing track.\" \nTickets for the Berkeley date are on sale now at their website . \nNo details have yet been given as far as when tickets for the two April benefits will go on sale; we will update when more information is released.
