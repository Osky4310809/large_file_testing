Oh, my God! No one ever does that. That’s a mistake! How did he do that? That’s ridiculous.’ Okay, the granddaddy of them all, the Oscars, and they handed that guy the wrong envelope … Boy, do I know that feeling.”\nHarvey also pointed out that while Warren Beatty caught some flack for the incident, it was actually his co-presenter, Faye Dunaway , who read the wrong name: “ disappeared and Warren didn’t even read the wrong name, but when he walked back up to do the apology he became the guy — the lady read the name and then she just left!”\nRegardless, Harvey said he can empathize with the miscue.\n“People have read the wrong name a thousand times — it’s just you never see it because it’s not live. But boy, when it’s live, that was one of the greatest moments of television for me in my entire life, watching them,” he said.\nRELATED: How Emma Stone’s Reaction to the Oscar Mishap Took the Internet by Storm \nAs for how he thinks Beatty is handling the heat, Harvey said, “He’s old school, he’s not used to social media backlash — I’m an expert.”\nThe Family Feud host also commented on “Gary from Chicago,” saying he hopes to bring the tourist who made an Oscars cameo onto his talk show.\n“He just got out of prison, been out three days, he walks into the Oscars and he hits the jackpot, man,” Harvey said. “It was really a great story.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:24:34.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
