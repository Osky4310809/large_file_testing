Again you have to try to defend better, but I think in about 12-15 minutes of the second half in our game in Monaco we created five chances and few teams in Europe can do that. \n\"Chances where you arrive at the byline and with one pass you score a goal, but we missed those chances. That's happened a lot, a lot of times. \n\"In the second half, Monaco created no chances [from open play] – [Tiemoue Bakayoko's] goal, which was a set-piece, nothing else. \n\"The problem in Monaco was in the first half when we didn't create. That is what worried me the most. \n\"In the last games in the Premier League we conceded few. We were so stable.\" \nCity had kept six consecutive clean sheets in all competitions before facing Leonardo Jardim's swashbuckling Monaco and Guardiola has been pleased with the form of John Stones. \nThe 22-year-old former Everton centre-back's maiden season in Manchester has been dogged by some high-profile errors, but his manager is optimistic over the England international's future prospects \nGuardiola rules out £600m transfer spend \n\"John Stones next season will be a better player,\" he said. \"The last month, month and a half John made a huge step forward, but next season will be better. \n\"He is so young, it is the first time he has got to Europe to play at Camp Nou and these kind of stages. \n\"I am delighted with his performances and how important he will be for your national team in the future. \n\"Of course he makes mistakes, but it is part of the process. I never saw a central defender of 21 years playing on the biggest stages who doesn’t make mistakes. It is impossible. We need to create a good environment to help him.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T03:02:24.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
