Big details still need to be worked out, of course, most prominently, which track would lose a race so that Vegas would get one? But we love the idea of a playoff race in Las Vegas. Here are five reasons why: Stephen R. Sylvanie Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports 5 Las Vegas is a destination Let’s face it, Las Vegas is one of the world’s most popular destinations, a place that draws millions of tourists every year because there’s so much to see and do. It’s an exciting, high-energy town and that’s exactly what NASCAR’s playoffs should be. Stephen R. Sylvanie Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports 4 The community is behind it Every since Las Vegas Motor Speedway hosted its first Cup race in 1998, it’s had huge support from local government and the business community. Moving the awards banquet to Las Vegas has been a home run, too. Nothing says “big event” like Las Vegas, and a NASCAR playoff race is a big event. Jerome Miron Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports 3 The racers would support it The Cup teams and drivers love coming to Las Vegas for many of the same reasons tourists do: There’s lots of fun to be had and an almost limitless choice of entertainment options. More to the point, a huge part of running a successful race team is building and maintaining relationships with sponsors. You can provide world-class entertainment for big-ticket sponsors in Las Vegas. In some of the current Cup playoff tracks, all you really have is a race. Jerome Miron Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports 2 NASCAR needs more West Coast playoff races Right now, Phoenix is the only true West Coast Cup playoff race, with the majority of the races in the East and Midwest. Las Vegas would increase the geographic diversity of the playoff races. Stephen R. Sylvanie Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports 1 The schedule is due for a change In the last five years, NASCAR has gotten a new series title sponsor, introduced a new generation of cars, changed rules packages multiple times, altered the playoff format twice, added stage racing and overhauled how it officiates races. Yet the playoffs haven’t had a single new track added since Chicagoland Speedway replaced Auto Club Speedway in 2011. The schedule is old, it’s stale and it’s badly in need of refreshing. A Las Vegas playoff race would be a great place to start.
