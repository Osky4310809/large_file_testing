The other expected specs include a 5.5-inch full HD display with 2.5D Gorilla glass, 1.8GHz octa-core MediaTek processor, and 4GB of RAM. \nThe Gionee A1 will reportedly feature 64GB of expandable storage. The camera department will include a 16-megapixel selfie shooter and a 13-megapixel primary snapper. The phone will come with an IR blaster, dual-SIM slots, Android 7.0 Nougat with Amigo OS 4.0 and a 4,010mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. \nThe source claims that the Gionee A1 will be launched in Nepal on March 15th, and will be priced there at around Rs 22,500.
