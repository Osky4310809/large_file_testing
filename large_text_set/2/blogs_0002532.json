The initial disclosure came in a federal court hearing in Virginia in a case challenging the revocation of the visas of a pair of Yemeni brothers who arrived at Washington’s Dulles airport on Jan. 28. The Justice Department initially said 100,000 visas had been revoked, but the State Department later claimed it was closer to 60,000.\n\nThe admission capped a week of legal and political turmoil triggered by the imposition of a ban that could reshape the network of allegiances and historic grudges that govern the modern Middle East. Nation states there divided roughly into two camps: those affected by the ban, and those exempt. Among the first camp, outrage ensued. Iran banned U.S. citizens from entering. The Iraqi parliament called for the same. An official from Libya’s U.S.-backed government accused America of “racial discrimination.” But elsewhere there was a tactical silence. With their citizens unaffected by the ban, the governments of some U.S.-allied states, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, declined to comment. The United Arab Emirates defended the ban .\nThroughout the region, Trump’s executive order seemed to foreshadow a coming season of turbulence in relations with the United States. During his campaign, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown” on all Muslims entering the United States. Here, in the first week of Trump’s administration, was a policy that followed through on his campaign rhetoric, apparently with little regard for the geopolitical fallout.\n“The Americans don’t get to act in a vacuum, and when they do act they will often trigger responses from other political leaders who have their own political base. And I don’t think they thought about that at all with respect to Iraq and Iran. My guess is they would say, ‘we don’t care,’” says Robert S. Ford, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria and a career diplomat with years of experience in the Middle East.\nCarlos Barria—Reuters President Donald Trump signs an executive order imposing a four-month travel ban on refugees entering the United States and a 90-day hold on travelers from Syria, Iran and five other Muslim-majority countries at the Pentagon in Washington on Jan. 27, 2017. U.S. allies in the region now face a choice of acquiescing to a policy that appears to indiscriminately target citizens of other Arab and Muslim states, or rattle relations with the new U.S. administration by expressing reservations about the ban. Few seem likely to take the latter path; among states not included in the ban, only Qatar voiced criticism of the new policy. Asked about the ban, Egypt’s former ambassador to the U.S. Abdel Raouf el-Reedy tells TIME, “Is Egypt supposed to say—to comment on anything happening in the United States?”\nTrump spoke on Sunday with Saudi King Salman, but a Saudi readout of the call made no reference to the ban. In Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates’ foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan voiced support for the Trump’s policy, saying the executive order “is not directed at a certain religion.” Israel’s right-wing government remained silent. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted in support of Trump’s plan to build a wall on U.S.-Mexico border, but Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin later apologized to his Mexican counterpart for that statement.\nThere was far more dissent within the U.S. than in the Middle East. The executive order enacted on Jan. 27 created days of chaos at America’s international airports, as customs and border officials struggled to interpret the order. The White House initially declared that the order also applied to permanent legal residents of the United States—Green Card holders—before reversing that position two days later. As a policy, the order mirrored Trump’s personal style: abrupt, unpredictable and sometimes inscrutable.\n“He’s too erratic. It’s one of the things that sets off everybody around the world, that he just says stuff. He issues policy, this crazy Muslim ban thing. And nobody knows quite what it means, so they’re scrambling,” says. H.A. Hellyer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council and the Royal United Services Institute in London.\n“Imagine you’re sitting in one of these foreign ministries. Is there a difference between ‘Real Donald Trump’ tweeting and POTUS tweeting? Is there a difference, policy-wise? That’s how some people are going to look at it,” he adds.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:14:36.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
