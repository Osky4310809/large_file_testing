Robin Hood has a reputation for being quite clean and wholesome, aside from Alan Rickman ’s amazing performance in the Kevin Costner version, but it’s tights and thigh-slapping and merry men,” Taron told Collider . “This is really kind of dark and gritty and very funny too, but it’s a real revisionist version of the story. There’s no singing and riding through the glen in this; it’s a real war movie. Quite an anti-establishment war movie, I would say… It’s dark. And Robin’s not perfect in it, either, which is what I like about it. He’s not a classic hero, he makes mistakes.”\n40+ pictures inside of Taron Egerton on the set of the movie… ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T20:59:32.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
