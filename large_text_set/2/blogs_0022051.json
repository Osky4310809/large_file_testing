What is it? \n\"VX is the most toxic chemical weapon ever produced,\" according to Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former NATO commanding officer and leading chemical weapons expert. “ VX acts so quickly that victims would have to be injected with the antidote almost immediately to have a chance at survival” \nIt's banned under several international conventions and was designated a weapon of mass destruction by a U.N. resolution in April 1991. \nIts origins date back to the early 1950s, when a British scientist named Ranajit Ghosh was researching pesticides and developed the \"V-series\" of nerve agents — the V stood for \"venom.\" \nAccording to the Council on Foreign Relations , a Washington-based think tank, the compound was deemed to deadly for commercial use. \nHowever, the U.K. shared the formula with the American government, which began full-scale production of VX in 1961. Who has it? \nDuring the Cold War, both Washington and Moscow built up large quantities of chemical weapons, including VX. \nBut after signing the Chemical Weapons Convention, which banned the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, the U.S. says it has destroyed all of its arsenal and Russia has pledged to do the same by 2020. \nElsewhere, the spread of VX is believed to be relatively contained, mainly because it takes a sophisticated laboratory to produce. \nSaddam Hussein was accused successfully weaponizing VX in the 1980s, before using it against Iranian forces and the Kurds. \nA decade later, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo killed 12 people on the Tokyo subway using the less-toxic nerve agent sarin. The group also killed one person using VX. Victims of a sarin attack by doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo are taken to hospital in Tokyo, Japan, on March 20, 1995. Chiaki Tsukumo / AP \nThe apparent assassination of Kim Jong Nam would add North Korea to this inglorious list. \nAlthough the recent focus has been on its nuclear arsenal, the country is believed to possess between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative , a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C. \n\"Nerve agents such as Sarin and VX are thought be to be the focus of North Korean production,\" it said, although Kim's death would be the first known occasion where the country has actually deployed it. \nNorth Korea, Egypt and South Sudan are the only countries in the world that haven't signed the Chemical Weapons Convention. How does VX work? \nUnlike sarin, which is usually deployed as a gas, VX is very slow to evaporate and is therefore usually found as a viscous liquid, similar in texture to motor oil or honey. \nIn this state, it's highly toxic when it comes into contact with skin. \n\"You need a microscopic amount to kill one person, which is what happened to Kim Jong Nam,\" said Bretton-Gordon, the chemical weapons expert.

But this needs to be administered almost immediately to be effective. \n\"VX acts so quickly that victims would have to be injected with the antidote almost immediately to have a chance at survival,\" according to the Council on Foreign Relations. \nBretton-Gordon added that \"Kim Jong Nam had absolutely no chance at all.\" \nVX also featured in the 1996 action thriller \"The Rock.\" \nAlthough the symptoms displayed in the movie — the liquid evaporating quickly and burning the skin — are inaccurate, and more closely associated with chlorine. Why was no one else killed? \nThis might be down to VX's chemical properties. It doesn't evaporate very quickly, so people have less chance of breathing it into their lungs. \nThere may have been one other casualty, however: Malaysian officials say that one of the two women who allegedly attacked Kim vomited after the incident.

This tallies with guidelines from the U.S. Army, saying that \"a solution of common household bleach and water, followed by water rinse, can be used to decontaminate the skin where contact was made with VX.\" \nThe airport itself has not been decontaminated and has remained open and at full capacity for more than a week. \nAsked by The Associated Press whether officials would sterilize the area following the discovery of VX, Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said: \"We are doing it now.\" How was VX smuggled into Malaysia? \nAssuming the chemical was made in North Korea and not Malaysia itself, getting such a potent substance past security may have been relatively easy.

What are the wider implications? \nFor the past decade, international focus has been on North Korea's ability to produce a nuclear weapon — something analysts predict is some way off. \nBut Kim's assassination may reveal a far more short-term threat: that it could arm a long-range missile with VX and fire it at a city or a military base. \nPreviously, one thing that's reassured experts about terrorists' ability to use VX is that it's very hard to produce. \"It's not something you can knock up in your back shed,\" according to Bretton-Gordon. \nBut this also means that the substance used to kill Kim was likely cooked up in a government-level laboratory — another indication that Pyongyang was behind the attack. \n\"If they were behind this then it means a nation state has taken a weapon of mass destruction into another country and used it,\" Bretton-Gordon added. \"It will be very interesting to see what the international reaction will be.\" Alexander Smith", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:00:33.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
