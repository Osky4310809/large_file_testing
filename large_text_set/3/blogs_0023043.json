Everyone else has the same lens, but every other country has the advantage of being at the previous meeting.” \nGerman media outlet DW reported that the official communique also dropped language signifying a commitment to “free” trade but was unable to add language focused on “fair” trade.   \nOther changes included the removal of language expressing a commitment to the World Trade Organization, as well as the financing of various climate change programs . \n“We will strive to reduce excess global imbalances to promote inclusiveness and fairness and reduce inequality,” Mnuchin told journalists after the summit. “We think there are parts of the WTO that are not being enforced and will look to aggressively enforce things in the interest of American workers.” \n“I understand what the president’s desire is and his policies, and I negotiated them from here,” Mnuchin said, according to Reuters . “I couldn’t be happier with the outcome.” \n“We believe in free trade, we are in one of the largest markets in the world, we are one of the largest trading partners in the world, trade has been good for us, it has been good for other people,” Mnuchin added. “Having said that, we want to re-examine certain agreements.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:22:07.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
