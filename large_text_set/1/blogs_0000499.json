And aren’t they so easy to totally scar for life? What follows is a collection of 20 of the most amazing, irresponsible, catastrophically wrong-headed parenting photographs ever assembled – from snake cuddling to unsupervised tricycling, these kids are bound for either reality TV or the grave. \nI’m sure that kid’s mother is so happy that she went through 9 months of Hell so that her husband could have his own personal dwarf Coyote Ugly bartender. \nThat’s nice. Raw meat right on top of the kid. God forbid you carry a tote bag – wouldn’t want anybody to think you were a faggit . \nYeah, the kid’s really enjoying that, you creepy backwoods Steve Irwin. \nIt could be worse – at least the little guy knows how to share. \nIt’s called “Slip & Slide,” not “Drop & Concuss.” \nLook at how jaded that little dude is. He’s seen this routine a couple dozen times. He’s all “Mom, you lost some focus in the bit where you winked your cooch at the mark. Keep your energy up during the drum break in ‘Freak Nasty’ and you’ll get better tips. Just saying.” \nThe one in the middle has already iced somebody. She ain’t playin’. \n“Oh, I’m just keeping her warm for Daddy.” \nDo you know how hard it is to get white-hot nacho cheese out of a diaper? \nYou know what, little Korean dude has to work. Don’t begrudge him a living. \nThey’ll wash him off before they eat him, at least. \nSomeday, kid, you’ll look back on all of this and laugh. If you survive. \nWhat? He’s buckled in. We’re only going to Papa John’s, it’s like three miles. I’m not even that drunk. \nGeorge Washington chopped down a cherry tree. I think this kid is at best an Insane Clown Posse fan. \nSnakes are totally clean, bro. Like the cleanest animal on Earth. It’s cool. \nWould you prefer he not wear a helmet at all? At least this way, if he gets into an accident, all of his brains will be inside the bag. \nThat’s great. You made your daughter into a sea whore. \nHey, who am I to tell them what to spend their allowance on? \nThis is totally the worst because that kid has no legs. He couldn’t even make a pathetic attempt at running away to give the noble lioness some sport. Do you know how demoralizing that is for them? \nYeah, you’re probably right. \nCheck out more hilarity in our 20 Worst Archive. K.
