Research by Arcview Market Research, a leading publisher of marijuana market research, and its  big-data partner  New Fron tier  projects this number to grow to nearly $8 billion by 2020.\nAt a late September breakfast in Beverly Hills, Entrepreneur's Kim Lachance Shandrow asked five of the six Shark Tank Sharks how they feel about the growing marijuana industry, and whether they'd invest.\nDallas billionaire Mark Cuban told her he'd keep his money out of it:\n\"Would I invest in the cannabis industry? No. Not because I have anything against pot. I don't care. But right now it's a gold rush. When everybody's rushing in it's hard to keep track of what everybody's doing because there's a new startup every single day.\n\"I think the oversaturation of the market creates a very difficult challenge.

And if Snoop Dogg's in it, it's over for everyone else.\" \nHe went on to highlight the difficulty of getting involved in an industry so hampered by regulations and red tape, and said again he thinks we're late to the game:\n\"There's a saying that I live by: 'First there are the innovators. Then there are the imitators. Then there are the idiots.' The three I's. You have to know which one you are, and I think already in the cannabis industry, we've at least gotten to the imitators and we may already be to the idiots.\"\nYou can read Cuban's entire reaction and the rest of the Sharks' responses — with the exception of Daymond John, who wasn't present — on Entrepreneur .\nNOW WATCH: You can now have your weed legally delivered in 60 minutes or less with this new app \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T20:30:12.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
