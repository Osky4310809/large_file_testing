These exercises strengthen the U.S.-ROK alliance and improve regional security,” said Navy Cmdr. Clay Doss. \n“It’s neither surprising nor concerning that other regional navies may have an interest in our exercises so long as they operate safely and professionally. For information about the presence and intent of Russian naval vessels, we refer you to the Russian Navy,” he said in a statement to Breitbart News. \nThe Russian surveillance comes as the Trump administration has spoken of seeking to improve the U.S.-Russia relationship. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is reportedly planning to go to Russia in April, according to a report by Reuters. \nRussia’s presence in the region also adds to what is already a tense situation. \nNorth Korea fired a mid-range missile Wednesday , seen as a message of warning to the U.S. and South Korea. The missile reportedly exploded within seconds of launch. \nEarlier this week, North Korea released a video showing a simulated attack on the Vinson as well as a U.S. B-1B Lancer, accompanied by bellicose language. North Korea also recently announced it had tested a new rocket engine. U.S. defense officials told CNN the engine could be used for a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile. \nNorth Korea had launched at least four ballistic missiles in tests earlier this month, which prompted the Trump administration to announce it had begun deploying the first elements of the THAAD missile defense system to South Korea, a move opposed by China. \nChina’s foreign ministry blamed the joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises – expected to last until April 30 – for the heightened tensions. \n“‘Everyone with his dagger drawn’ would be a fair description,” the Chinese foreign ministry said.
