He was a key fourth-quarter cog as a point guard in a fourth-quarter rally from 13 points down in Milwaukee on Jan. 6 as Derrick Rose sat the entire period. Hornacek has praised Baker for bringing energy on defense and making the simple pass on offense. He played both point guard and shooting guard at Wichita State.\nBefore revealing the change, Hornacek mentioned what he would be looking for.\n“You’re looking for the little things, who’s going to do the little things, make the extra pass, make sure defensively this guy gets stopped,’’ Hornacek said. “Who is in the help position more often than not? Who’s going to be that guy that elevates the other guys and does the little things not in the box score? I look at [assistant coach] Kurt Rambis that way. His stats weren’t great on the Lakers, but defensively he was always in the right spot.”\nLee, who had a poor game in Toronto, said afterward he felt the bench players were bringing more energy than the starters were.\nRookie Mindaugas Kuzminskas also was placed in the starting lineup in place of Kristaps Porzingis, who will miss his sixth game of the season with Achilles tendinitis. Lance Thomas also was out after suffering a broken orbital bone and concussion symptoms Sunday in Toronto. It is the first NBA start for Kuzminskas and Baker.\nBefore the game, Hornacek said he thought Porzingis had a shot at playing, but the team announced after warmups he was a no-go. This is the third straight contest he’s missed.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:23:27.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
