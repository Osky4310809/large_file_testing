We were thinking the same thing. \nThe nefarious plots of shadowy “globalists” have long been a staple of the Trump-favored purveyors of news-like-product. Whether it’s hidden in the pages of a plan to make the world slightly more sustainable , or blatantly trying to stage a military takeover of Texas , the global conspiracy never sleeps. \nBut for those Wolverines who have long been shouting about how the United States would never be a part of this New World Order, take heart. The world doesn’t want us. \nNot Germany. \nGermany must stand up in opposition to the 45th president of the United States and his government. That's difficult enough already for two reasons: Because it is from the Americans that we obtained our liberal democracy in the first place; and because it is unclear how the brute and choleric man on the other side will react to diplomatic pressure. \nNot the United Kingdom . \nDonald Trump will not be welcome to address Parliament on his state visit to the UK because of his racist and sexist attitudes, the Speaker of the House of Commons has said in a major snub to the American president. \nAnd they’re not the only ones. \nThe irony that Germany is put in the position of leading the fight against a rising tide of fascism isn’t lost on anyone, least of all Germany. And they know they can’t go it alone. \nThe fact that opposition to the American government can only succeed when mounted together with Asian and African partners -- and no doubt with our partners in Europe, with the EU -- doesn't make the situation any easier. ... \nHey, conspiracy theorists … wake up! This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. Germany, Germany , is building a world-wide alliance against the United States. And it sounds like there will be no Battle of Britain required in forming this alliance, because Britain is already on board. \nDonald Trump isn’t welcome to speak to the Parliament, and is afraid of running into Prince Charles. \nMr Trump’s visit is fast emerging as a political minefield. His team are reportedly hoping avoid any meeting with Prince Charles, whose environmental campaigning might put him at odds with the president. \nIn fact, he’d be better off just staying home. \nNearly two million people signed a petition calling for Mr Trump's state visit to be cancelled in just days after it was announced. MPs are to debate the issue in Westminster Hall. \nInstead he could just make a state visit to Mar-a-lago. Then he can sit around in his bathrobe, sneering at the TV, and muttering about how they’re “all out to get me.” Because they are. They really are. \nAt home and around the world, those who say that Donald Trump can’t bring people together have been proven wrong again and again. There’s always been this theory that nothing brings unity like a common enemy. Now there is one. Except, perhaps, that enemy isn’t really the United States. \nIt is literally painful to write this sentence, but the president of the United States is a pathological liar. The president of the U.S. is a racist (it also hurts to write this). He is attempting a coup from the top; he wants to establish an illiberal democracy, or worse; he wants to undermine the balance of power. He fired an acting attorney general who held a differing opinion from his own and accused her of \"betrayal.\" This is the vocabulary used by Nero, the emperor and destroyer of Rome. It is the way tyrants think.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:47:29.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
