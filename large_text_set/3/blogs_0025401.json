Two amazing plays, only one of which counted.\nFirst: Xavier scores a bucket when Gonzaga’s Johnathan Williams fails to corral a rebound which bounces off of his face into the basket. Have you ever seen this before?\nAfter a Gonzaga bucket, Xavier’s J.P. Macura fired a 3 ⁄ 4 court shot and drained it at the buzzer. Unfortunately, it was just a hair late:\nWeird things happen when there’s a Final Four berth on the line.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:12:13.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
