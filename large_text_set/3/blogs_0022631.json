Foundation leaders will set up a parallel defense fund for Muslims this spring. By Shannon Prather Star Tribune March 22, 2017 — 2:06pm Jerry Holt, Star Tribune St. Paul Police officers stood out front of The St. Paul Jewish Community Center after it was evacuated after receiving a bomb threat Monday February 20, 2017.   A surge in anti-Semitism, including 150 bomb threats made against Jewish schools and community centers across the country and in the Twin Cities, has prompted the Minneapolis Foundation to create a new fund to help local Jewish organizations enhance security. The foundation has seeded it with a $50,000 donation and is encouraging people to contribute to show solidarity with the Jewish community. \"The Faith In Each Other Fund\" will help pay for staff training, coordination and technology to amp up security at synagogues, schools and the two Jewish community centers in the region. The work will be done in partnership with law enforcement and private security. The foundation will set up a parallel fund for Muslims this spring. \"For the past 100 years, The Minneapolis Foundation has been working toward creating a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive,\" said R.T. Rybak, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Foundation, in a written statement. \"Religious intolerance has no place in our community, and it is essential that everyone who lives here stand up against the deeply distressing instances of bias and hate that we have seen in recent months.\" The Minneapolis Foundation joins a growing coalition of politicians, law enforcement and faith-based groups vowing to help protect faith communities now under attack. Sen. Amy Klobuchar met Sunday with local leaders at the St. Paul Jewish Community Center and pledged more federal aid for security at community centers. FBI Special Agent in Charge Richard Thornton, Acting U.S. Attorney Greg Brooker and St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell all stood together at the St. Paul JCC last week to update the investigation into telephoned bomb threats to both Jewish community centers in St. Louis Park and St. Paul this year. In February, leaders of several Twin Cities Muslim organizations placed an ad in the Star Tribune extending their sympathy and support to Jews affected by bias-inspired acts. Clergy from more than 220 faith communities also signed a letter in support of the Jewish community. There are between 35,000 and 40,000 Jewish people in Minnesota, primarily in the Twin Cities. The Jewish community has always prioritized security but it's taken on a new urgency, said Steve Hunegs, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas. \"Now there is a greater appreciation for the need in our community — in all communities,\" Hunegs said. \"One community at risk places many communities at risk.\" Hunegs said he is thrilled the foundation is also creating a fund for Muslim security. He said there has been a rise in hate speech directed at the Jewish community in recent times. In addition to the bomb threats, anti-Semitic fliers and postings have popped up on the University of Minnesota campus. \"Three thousand years of Jewish history is 3,000 years of anti-Semitism. It waxes and wanes with times,\" Hunegs said. \"In times of political and economic uncertainty, you see elevated amounts to anti-Semitism. Perhaps we are living in those times now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:24:35.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
