Back at CES in January, we were able to go hands-on with the new Blade V8 Pro , a budget-friendly smartphone with dual 13MP rear-facing cameras. Just two days later, the company announced the Blade V8 (without the Pro), which still offered great mid-range specs. Today, here at MWC 2017 , ZTE is taking the wraps off two Android 7.0 Nougat -powered smartphones, the Blade V8 Mini and Blade V8 Lite.\nThe higher-end device out of the two is the ZTE Blade V8 Mini (pictured above), which sports a metallic unibody design. Perhaps the most standout feature the V8 Mini offers is its 13 and 2MP dual camera setup on the back, which will allow you to take advantage of bokeh effects and a handy refocus mode. These cameras also support a 3D shooting mode, which will allow the sensors to take photos from different angles and combine them together to generate 3D pictures. What’s more, the device also comes with manual camera controls and automatic HDR.\nSee also: ZTE Blade V8 Pro hands-on January 4, 2017 \nThe Blade V8 Mini does not skimp on the pro camera features\nThe V8 Mini sports a 5.0-inch display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of on-board storage, expandable memory, a 5MP front camera and a non-removable 2,800mAh battery. It also features a fingerprint sensor on the back, which will let you launch your favorite app when the screen is off or locked. And as mentioned, the V8 Mini also runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, complete with ZTE’s MiFavor 4.2 software overlay. The V8 Mini will initially be available in several Asia Pacific and European markets. Pricing and availability details have yet to be announced.\n\nThat’s not the only device ZTE launched today, though. The company has also unveiled the Blade V8 Lite (pictured above). This device sports a metal chassis, a 5.0-inch display, an octa-core MediaTek 6750 processor, an 8MP rear camera, 5MP front camera, as well as a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. In addition, this device runs Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, along with ZTE’s Mifavor 4.2.\nThe Blade V8 Lite will be available in Italy, Germany and Spain at launch, and will roll out to more Asia Pacific and European markets later on. No pricing or exact availability details have been announced yet, but we’ll be sure to update you as we learn more.\nAndroid Authority is on the show floor at MWC 2017, bringing you all the new news as it happens.
