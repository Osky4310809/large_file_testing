Suddenly, the woman motions to the crowd around her breasts and points at Elliott. He then reaches over to the woman next to him and pulls down the strap of her top, exposing her left breast to the crowd below. \nAccording to TMZ’s report, Elliott’s representative said that the woman wasn’t upset with Elliott and hung out with him and his friends once it concluded.

NFL has no comment on the video of Ezekiel Elliot pulling down a woman's top at a St. Patrick's Day parade. \n— ProFootballTalk (@ProFootballTalk) March 13, 2017 \nElliott has been under investigation by the NFL in regard to domestic violence allegations. The investigation is still ongoing, Sports Illustrated reported , and the league sent Elliott follow-up questions in January. \nHis ex-girlfriend filed a police report in July that said he assaulted her inside of a car . Once the report was filed, Elliott denied the allegations and no charges were filed by authorities . It was later found that the same woman accused Elliott of assault in February 2016 in Florida, according to a report from The Dallas Morning News . \nBut a report by USA Today found that the allegations are still undergoing an investigation by the NFL and a conclusion hasn’t yet come. The NFL can suspend or fine a player in the league even if criminal charges aren’t ever filed against him. \nIn January, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones expressed his support of Elliott through the NFL’s investigation. He told The Dallas Morning News that he believes Elliott and thinks the probe will wrap up prior to training camp. \nI don’t want to get ahead because that’s obviously somebody other than me, but I’m well aware of all of the circumstances involved there and have felt good about it since training camp and have seen nothing that in any way would make me think any differently than we felt shortly after it became a point. I don’t want to get into how this comes out one way or the other. \nElliott, who just completed his rookie season with the Cowboys, led the league in rushing yards by a landslide. He rushed for 1,631 yards on 322 carries to go along with 15 touchdowns. \nFor his huge success on the ground, the Ohio State University star was awarded the FedEx Ground Player of the Year award at the NFL Honors ceremony in February .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T13:41:47.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
