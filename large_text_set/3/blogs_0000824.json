There is a drum brake and spoked wheels model that goes for RM4,535.74 and the disc brake and cast wheels variant which costs RM4,927.74 , with all prices include GST. \nNew for 2017 is the Pearl Nightfall Blue colour scheme, which complements the existing Pearl Magellanic Black and Vivacity Red Wave Alpha models. A pillion grab rail is now standard on the disc brake Wave Alpha. \nCurrently claimed to be the market leader in the small-capacity kapchai market, the Honda Wave Alpha sports a 109.1 cc air-cooled OHC single-cylinder mill powering a four-speed automatic clutch gearbox. Power is listed at 8.3 hp at 7,500 rpm while torque is rated at 8.59 Nm at 5,500 rpm. \nCertified as an energy efficient vehicle (EEV) , the Wave Alpha is touted as having better fuel economy than before, with fuel carried in a 3.7-litre tank. A small cubby storage space under the seat is big enough to hold small items such as sunglasses or a folded raincoat. \nComing with both an electric and kick-starter, the Honda Wave Alpha weighs in at 93 kg. The Wave Alpha is available at all Honda Impian showrooms and authorised dealers from today. Coming with diverse and extensive experience in heavy engineering, Mohan enjoys making anything with wheels go fast, especially motorcycles. His weapon of choice is the Desmoquattro engine, and he has a penchant for anything with a dash of Italian design. Strangely enough, he insists he's a slow rider.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:13:40.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
