He was coming off a fifth-place run at Atlanta, and opened the season by leading 39 laps and finishing 14th in the Daytona 500 after starting from the pole. \nAll of which indicates that his first Cup win cannot possibly be too far out in his future. \n“I’m really proud of the way we have performed,” Elliott said. “Our pit stops have been great, our cars have been good. We’ve been able to run solidly in the top five the past couple weeks, which is great for me and our team, and we’ve just got to keep that going and find that next little bit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T17:54:26.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
