That’s not exactly what you call acting, is it?\n‘I would probably play myself. I have not seen an actor that looks like me or that I’d particularly want to represent me,’ he told the Confidential On Nova radio show.\nWe’re not convinced that anyone’s told him how badly this could shake out.\nLewis hasn’t seen anyone he would want to star as him (Picture: Clive Mason/Getty Images) That being said, Lewis has an impressive story – and the screenplay would focus on his rags to riches story and how his dad worked three jobs to support him as a young driver who went on to become three-time world champion who won his first title with McLaren in 2008 before moving to Mercedes, where he won back-to-back titles in 2014 and 2015.\n‘My story is about coming from humble beginnings. I am probably the last of a dying breed because pretty much every other driver I’m racing with has come from wealth,’ he said.\n‘It will be really telling a family story about where we’ve come from, how we did it as a family, the sacrifices my family made and the trials and tribulations we came across along the way.’\nThank you, Melbourne!
