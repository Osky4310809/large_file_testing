They were formed by people who thought the Chamber of Commerce was too progressive and they’ve railed against schools, parks, pools, public transportation, public health, and pretty much everything that makes a Lincoln a great city. LIBA President and Drive Time Lincoln host Coby Mach For people unfamiliar with Coby Mach , he is the president and CEO of LIBA and also the host of the conservative talk radio show “ Drive Time Lincoln. ” Ever since this 2011 Lincoln Journal Star article came out , I have never understood how LIBA could successfully keep it’s nonprofit tax exempt status while paying Coby Mach a six figure salary as a political operative. Mach has tried to explain , but the nuances of LIBA PAC versus LIBA get jangled and he gets away with violating the spirit of tax exempt laws, if not the letter of the laws. In 2013 LIBA leaders upped the ante and formed the PAC “ Citizens For A Better Lincoln ” who’s sole purpose was bringing trashy beltway style politics to Lincoln with hatchet-piece hits on Democratic candidates. Coby spent all of spring 2013 lying that Citizens for a Better Lincoln and LIBA were unrelated, but... EXCLUSIVE — FCC Filing Documents from 2013 prove that Coby Mach was lead political operative for Citizens For A Better Lincoln Please CLICK HERE to download all of the radio contracts proving that Coby Mach operated as the main political operative on behalf of Citizens For A Better Lincoln while being paid a 6-figure salary from LIBA, a group that maintains a non-profit tax exempt status. Coby Mach, with Governor Ricketts and others in Cleveland this summer at the Republican National Convention, serving as a Trump delegate. Social Media graphic promoting the peaceful demonstration outside the LIBA Luncheon Mach was recently called out mercilessly by the Lincoln Journal Star editorial board for attending the Republican National Convention and his unwavering support for Donald Trump while claiming to be nonpartisan in his role with LIBA. I wrote a letter to the editor later discussing his unsettling Trump support (they got my city wrong.) Coby Mach and LIBA have stooped to the next level of hilarious absurdity recently in reaction to a peaceful protest outside a LIBA Luncheon where Senator Deb Fischer was the keynote speaker. The grassroots group Indivisible Lincoln thought that since Senator Fischer wouldn’t host any townhalls, they would bring the town hall to her while she met behind closed doors with rich donors and special interests. Emails obtained from the Lincoln Police Department show Coby Mach thought peaceful protesters should have been arrested and Lincoln Police should have provided free security to his private event. Email from Coby Mach to Lincoln Police Chief Jeffrey Bliemeister Coby Mach sent this to Lincoln Police Chief Jeffrey Bliemeister as proof of a terroristic threat. You can’t make this stuff up. Another screenshot and picture of a young man Coby Mach sent to the Police Chief that Mach considered a terroristic threat. Coby spoke with Lincoln Police Captain Jason Stille and was told that the Lincoln Police Department would not be providing on-duty personnell in a security capacity for a private event. Lincoln Police offer LIBA the same sort of private event security detail they offer any organization or event. For some reason Mach believed LIBA was owed taxpayer-funded security for their private event. Chief Bliemeister’s email to Mayor Beutler’s aide Molly Burton on his conversations with Mach. On Coby Mach’s February 21st podcast on Drive Time Lincoln he discusses the situation, accuses the Lincoln Journal Star of falsely reporting a peaceful protest, and bashes the police department for not providing free security for his private event and not arresting any protesters. The most hilarious quote “this isn’t little old Lincoln Nebraka anymore.” He also posted this to Facebook… Here’s Coby Mach bashing the Lincoln Police Department on Facebook, and admits that these were non-violent protests. For anyone following Lincoln politics and is familiar with the antics LIBA and Coby Mach have pulled over the years , watching Coby whine and cower like a schoolyard sissy over a peaceful demonstration is the kind of sheer entertainment only karma can provide. Watching LIBA spew nonsense and mudslinging against people far better than them like Gene Carroll , Meg Mikolajczyk , and countless others over the years leaves me with no sympathy for them. During 2011 Mayoral debate LIBA-recruited candidate Tammy Buffington makes a claim she can refuse funding from the federal government and state and can cut $180 million out of the city budget to pay for the South Beltway with “efficiencies” when the entire annual budget was around $120 million. The fact is, LIBA is not an effective political organization. They are 0–4 in contested races in the last 20 years, losing after endorsing the opponents of Don Wesley, Colleen Seng, and Chris Beutler twice, and in 2011 were forced to endorse Beutler after the candidate they recruited imploded during a debate. Republicans have enjoyed higher voter registration than Democrats for decades in Lincoln, still LIBA hasn’t been able to win a Mayoral race since Mike Johanns won in 1995. Given every monetary and registration advantage they continue to fall short.
