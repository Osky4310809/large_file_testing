There’s no doubt about it. \nBut, let’s remember that this is a starting point and there could be changes made to this bill. \nConservatives have a right to be mad because this isn’t the bill they were promised.   \nHowever, it is possible that this could be a step in the right direction.   \nThere is a lot to figure out. However, one thing is for sure, liberals are on the wrong side of this argument.   \nLiberals are celebrating the fact that the CBO came out today and said the bill will leave 14 million people uninsured. \nHowever, the CBO isn’t exactly the most reliable source in the world. \nThe media seems to be forgetting that the CBO did a terrible job scoring Obamacare. \nFrom The Daily Caller : googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nThe Congressional Budget Office said Monday that the White House-backed plan to repeal and replace Obamacare would result in an estimated 24 million more uninsured people by 2026. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nThe CBO previously overestimated the amount of people who would gain private health insurance due to Obamacare by the exact same number — 24 million. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nThe Weekly Standard reported that soon before Obamacare’s implementation in 2013, the CBO said that 201 million people on average would have private health insurance by 2016. The CBO downgraded that estimate to an average of 177 million people last year — a difference of 24 million people. \nThe point here is we shouldn’t get too worked up about what the CBO said. \nTrump’s HHS Secretary Tom Price isn’t buying what the CBO is selling either. \nFrom Mediaite : \nPrice said that they “disagree strenuously” with the report and added, “We believe that our plan will cover more individuals at a lower cost and give them the choices that they want for the coverage that they want for themselves and their family, not that the government forces them to buy.” \nThis GOP plan needs work. \nHowever, that doesn’t mean that liberals are correct when they use fearmongering to discredit it. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:47:24.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
