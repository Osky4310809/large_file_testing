But no matter how many times you've been burned by the sunflower-seed burger at that cafe that your juice-chugging friend from LA always wants to hit up when they're in town, trust us when we tell you that this is no ordinary vegan lasagna. \nYou won't find cardboardy, gluten-free noodles in this dish, nor a bland, unseasoned tomato sauce that claims to be \"clean,\" or, godforbid some spirulina dust or dehydrated cashew butter crackers. \nThis vegan lasagna recipe from author and Cro Mags frontman John Joseph is for people who love lasagna in all forms, and it's totally loaded with a super-flavorful homemade sauce, tons of cheese (vegan mozzarella and ricottaâ€”store-bought for your convenience), meatless ground beef, and yep, a bunch of veggies snuck in there for good measure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:28:34.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
