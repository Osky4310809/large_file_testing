While they won't cut it for deep cleaning, according to Consumer Reports , handvacs are great for picking up smaller messes that might not be worth breaking out a full-sized vacuum for.\nIf you're looking to invest in a handheld vacuum, there are a few things you'll want to consider before you buy: First, you'll need to choose whether you want a cordless or plug-in model. Cordless handvacs win when it comes to ease of use, but the battery will likely run out of juice in a matter of minutes, according to Consumer Search . Corded units are limited to where their cords can reach, but can keep going for the time it takes to, say, vacuum out your car.\nYou can also get more bang for your buck with a model that comes with versatile attachments. Good Housekeeping recommends looking out for accessories like dusting brushes, crevice tools, and rotating brushes for cleaning carpets and picking up pet hair. And, another handy tip from GH : Be sure to check out the switches before you buy. Some units make you hold down the button as you work, a real pain for vacuuming for more than, say, 30 seconds. Even better, find a model that boasts multiple speeds for different jobs.\nFrom versatile vacs to powerful suckers, check out our top picks for handheld vacuums:\nView As: One Page Slides Best for your budget Amazon With its long, skinny head and comfortable handle, the Black & Decker Dustbuster CHV1410 makes cleaning up a little bit less of a chore.
