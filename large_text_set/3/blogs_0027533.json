Deadline has the news, reporting that a The Pro movie is in the works, based on the 2002 one-shot from Image Comics and the creative team of writer Garth Ennis, the husband and wife art team of Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti , and colorist Paul Mounts . Although the original article does not mention that an R rating is being targeted by Paramount, it’s hard to imagine the source material getting adapted any other way. Zoe McCarthy ( Bitches on a Boat ) is providing the screenplay. \nRELATED: Preacher Season Two Premiere Date Set For June \nVery much a sendup of the superhero genre, The Pro follows a down on her luck waitress turned prostitute who, as part of a bet made between intergalactic beings, is given super powers. \n“My first and favorite candidate is Sarah Silverman,” Palmiotti wrote on his now defunct blog (via MTV) back in 2009. “First off, she is funny as hell and I think has the right attitude. Second, she can act… which is important for this to work and last, she has more balls than most people I know and would be willing and able to pull this off just right, in my opinion. I also think the big screen needs to see more of her.” \nPalmiotti also noted that Conner’s top choice at the time was for Dead Like Me ‘s Ellen Muth to play the lead. Of course, a lot may have changed over the last nine years. Check back for casting details when they become availalble. \nThe Pro movie will be produced by 3 Arts’ Erwin Stoff. \nAre you interested in a The Pro movie? Who would you cast in the leads?
