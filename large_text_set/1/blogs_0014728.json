They sound hispanic. There are drills sounding off. The screen opens to Logan in the backseat of a limo -- he wakes up and drops an a frustrated F-bomb. \nLogan stumbles out of the car, hearing Latino music play and seeing men taking the rims from his futuristic Chrysler 300 limousine. You can see on his face and hear from his grumbling that he is tired. The men are ready to fight, though. \nQuickly, they shoot him down mid-sentence. They think him dead -- big mistake. Logan lays on the ground, struggling to catch his breath. He stands back up and the men are shocked. He assures them: they don't want to do this. Still, they start punching him after he draws his claws for the first time. It takes him a second but he finds his wits and starts taking control of the fight before the tide turns once again in the criminals' favor. Logan is geting stomped...until he cuts off a man's arm, yells, \"Mother---er!\" and slices up the others, including a moment where his claws go clean through a man's head. \nOne man flees for his life. Logan is bitter about his escape and launches a pipe in his direction. \nImmediately, the tone of Logan is clear. The first scene conveys the harsh language (which Charles Xavier will take thorough part in, as well), brutal violence, and gritty, tired Logan we will be seeing throughout the film. \nCharles Xavier is all but crazy. One of the last remaining mutants, he is hiding out in the middle of a New Mexico desert, isolated from society to keep his \"incidents\" from effecting the public. Luckily for Logan, Caliban is around to help take care of him and prevent earth-shaking seizures by providing steady doses of medicine which Logan has been out retrieving. \nTheir desert paradise -- or hideaway -- falls apart when X-23 comes into the picture. Desperate for help, being hunted by Reavers, the little girl ends up at Logan and Caliban's hideout. Unfortunately for the squad, Donald Pierce now knows where they've been hiding. \nIt's when Pierce shows up with his band of machine-gunned-armed brutes that the film truly takes off. Although Logan has been fighting it, there's an undeniable connection to X-23, so much that Charles seems to be implying she is Logan's daughter. When Pierce's men want to search the property and find the young mutant for reasons unclear at this point, the action begins, again. This time, it's a breathtaking team-up between Wolverine and X-23. \nDonald Pierce shows up asking for Charles with a sarcastic, arrogant flavor which is enough to make us hate him without being aware of his motives. \nLogan insists the little girl isn't here says Xavier has been dead for a year. Pierce's metal hand comes up into frame and he tells Logan, \"You're not the only one who has been enhanced,\" before suddenly being hit in the head with a pipe. \nX-23 threw it. \nCharles is excited for her to be there, saying they've been waiting for her. She yanks her pink bag from Logan before heading to Charles' hideout. Caliban displaces the body but that's when reinforcements arrive -- prompting the aforementioned action sequence. X-23 is full of surprises, leaping from enemy to enemy, slicing them up as she goes while Wolverine does the same. \nAfter a well-fought battle, it's time to hightail it out of town and fulfill the mission begged by X-23's not-mother, Gabriela, to North Dakota. \nThe set up for the film after its first act is reminiscent of The Last of Us , one of the most acclaimed video games in history. Logan, like the game's Joel character, is reluctant to develop a relationship with the young girl but will inevitably become a father figure to her, whether he likes it or not. Their mission will take them from New Mexico to North Dakota, if things go according to their plan, but they will almost certainly run into more trouble along the way. \nThe father-daughter relationship which is forced upon Logan contains enough hard to balance the R-rated grit and language packed into almost every sequence. If that's not enough, Logan is watchable if only to hear Patrick Stewart yell the F-word a countless amount of times. \nThrough one-act, Logan sets itself up to be the best installment to the Wolverine franchise. It's almost enough to be worth the price of admission in itself. Some might argue that is not a credible scale given the receptions to X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Wolverine , but the film has tones similar to Deadpool in its raw portrayal of exasperated and drained super heroes -- the comedy is absent, but that's okay -- and looks like it will be a brilliant sendoff for Hugh Jackman 's run as the Adamantium X-Men.
