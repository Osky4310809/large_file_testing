TriMet plans to post updates as service alerts , as well as on its Twitter account . \nIf service is interrupted in the central city, it would continue in other areas, Saporta said. He said the agency hadn't determined whether it will stage extra vehicles in those areas to avoid delays. \nSaporta said the decision was made in response to protesters' behavior in earlier demonstrations, when protesters surrounded trains and buses and pounded on windows. He described the behavior as \"harassing\" transit operators and riders. \n\"We want to protect our employees and our customers,\" Saporta said Thursday, adding, \"I respect the right of freedom of speech. We're asking protesters to be respectful.\" \nPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Twitter that the transit agency had made the decision to suspend service without his input. He added he had told TriMet General Manager Neil McFarlane that police were \"well-prepared to minimize disruptions and protect riders.\" TriMet, an independent entity, makes their own decisions regarding their operations. They made this decision without my input. 3/4 \nWheeler said Wednesday that police would work to keep mass transit moving. \nThe city-owned Portland Streetcar said it would continue to operate \"unless conditions are unsafe.\" \nProtesters had previously blocked both MAX trains and buses while demonstrating against the approval of a new contract for Portland police officers , as well as after the election. It's the first time that TriMet has announced plans to suspend service ahead of planned protests. \nEvents planned Friday include including a student walkout at Portland State University starting at noon and a \"Rise up and Resist Fascism\" rally at Pioneer Courthouse Square at 3:30 p.m. \nTriMet says it hasn't yet developed its plan for Saturday, when a \"Women's March on Portland,\" affiliated with a national march in Washington, D.C., is expected to draw thousands of people. The route will cross TriMet's Red and Blue MAX lines and several bus lines. \nSan Francisco's BART, meanwhile, announced Thursday it would add extra cars to trains Friday and Saturday to accommodate larger crowds headed to and from inauguration events. It said extra officers from its in-house police department would be on duty for crowd control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:19:57.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
