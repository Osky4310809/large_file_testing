The All Blacks are expected to play the Barbarians later this year. Source: Getty Images \nThe fixture between the Baabaas and the All Blacks still requires the approval of the New Zealand board, but is highly likely to be approved. \nThe Barbarians received clearance to stage the fixture from the RFU on Wednesday (GMT) after approaching the organising body last month. \nBarbarians chairman John Spencer thanked the RFU for giving the fixture the green light, replacing a previously approved match against Australia. \nHe dismissed allegations the RFU had threatened to veto the Barbarians fixture altogether if not granted a Test against the All Blacks. \n“For the record, and contrary to some recent media reports, the Barbarians have a strong and very collaborative relationship with the RFU,” Spencer said. \n“Any suggestion that the RFU has not acted correctly in any part of the discussions around staging this fixture is unfair and wrong.” Jones upbeat about Irish loss 0:46 \nThe Baabaas have played New Zealand 10 times since 1954, most memorably when Gareth Edwards’ try contributed to a 23-11 win in Cardiff in 1973. \nThe Barbarians are next in action against England at Twickenham on May 28, and also play Ulster on June 1. \nDeparting Scotland head coach Vern Cotter will take charge of the team for those fixtures, with the coach for the All Blacks match still unknown. \nThe All Blacks will follow up the Barbarians match with northern tour Tests against France, Scotland and Wales. \nThey’ll also take on a number of Jones’ troops in this year’s British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand. \nEngland and the All Blacks are already locked in for a Test in 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:19:37.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
