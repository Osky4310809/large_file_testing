Fans can expect to see the show on their TV screens Mondays at 8 p.m., beginning May 10.\nThe reality show will then move to a regular slot on Tuesdays at 10 p.m., starting May 30. And OMG, Tuesday nights will never be the same again!\nIt’s been pretty cool watching as the production team puts the epic show together. And we can’t wait to see what else the gorgeous judge and executive producer Jennifer Lopez has in store for us! Maybe an awesome opening dance number with the show’s host Jenna Dewan Tatum? One could only hope!\n\nJ. Lo has been doing such a great job keeping fans in the loop on the show’s progress. And she posted this awesome Instagram announcement with the premiere date, below!\nMay 8th at 10pm!!! Don't miss #WorldOfDance on @nbc w/ @derekhough, @neyo and @jennaldewan \nA post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Mar 17, 2017 at 12:44pm PDT \nSeriously, it only makes sense that the original Fly Girl have a dance show of her own. And we’re dying to know which lucky and talented contestant will walk away with the million dollar prize.\nTen episodes to experience all that the show has to offer isn’t nearly enough. But, hey, we’ll take what we can get. We’re just hoping the TV gods sense our desperation, and add more episodes to following seasons.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T17:46:13.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
