In a year where women's issues have taken center stage—from ongoing debates about women's reproductive rights to a march that became one of the largest acts of protest in U.S. history—it's more important than ever to take a day to acknowledge women's worth in the world. \nWe'll be abstaining from our regularly-scheduled programming and devoting our site and social coverage wholly to International Women's Day actions—specifically, A Day Without a Woman , an initiative that seeks to raise awareness around issues of equality and women's rights through a one-day demonstration of solidarity. Expect coverage around today's IWD and ADWAW-related events, as well as conversation-sparking stories around the topics that affect women most. I highly recommend taking a look at our story around real people confronting the pay gap , for example, or this essay from a young woman who went from pro-life to pro-choice , or these excellent interviews with Women's March co-chair Linda Sarsour , Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice . We'll also be spotlighting some killer art on Instagram in partnership with Women Who Draw , a directory of illustrators, artists, and cartoonists who identify as female. \nGlamour has a long history of covering women's equality issues—looking through the archives from the '70s , one of our editors even found a list that called starting a consciousness-raising group a Glamour \"Do\"—and I'm proud to continue that legacy. \nA Day Without a Woman is, at its core, a moment for all of us to pause and think about how women impact our world big and small. It's a day where women and their allies can show support for the rights of women and all gender-oppressed people through a variety of actions, from taking the day off to simply wearing red. (Note: our homepage banner and social icons are red today!) Still others may abstain from action altogether, and instead simply take a moment to consider the women in their lives and communities. There's no right way to show your support: any action, no matter how small, has value. Today should be about inclusion, not exclusion. \nWhatever your plans, I encourage you to contribute some act of service, if you can. Think especially of acting locally. Sometimes the women who need your support most are closer than you think. These organizations are a great place to start!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:32:32.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
