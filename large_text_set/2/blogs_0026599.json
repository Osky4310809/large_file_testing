In his place, Iranian-American space traveler Anousheh Ansari read a statement Farhadi had written beforehand that called for empathy and denounced the desire to divide the world into “us and our enemies” just to create a “justification for aggression and war.” \nShortly after that, the U.S. State Department’s official Farsi-language Twitter account tweeted a message of congratulations to Farhadi and the people of Iran, but some time later the tweet was deleted. According to a statement given to Reuters , the State Department had decided that it wanted to “avoid any misperception that [the government] endorsed the comments made in the acceptance speech.” Supposedly, this decision came from within the department and not from a certain orange-faced politician higher up the food chain, but of course they’d say that. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:53:09.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
