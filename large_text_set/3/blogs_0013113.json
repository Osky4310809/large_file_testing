The offer, however, is only available for postpaid Airtel subscribers. Under the new ‘Suprise’ offer you will get 30GB of free data. The Airtel Surprise offer can be used for a period of three months from March 13. Meanwhile, the monthly limit for the ‘Surprise’ offer is 10GB for each month. The offer is valid only for postpaid users, and users can avail 10GB of free data each month, which will total up to 30GB. The deadline for subscribers to make use of this offer is March 31. \nIn order to get this offer, postpaid subscribers will have to go to the MyAirtel application on their smartphones. If you do not have the app, download it from the Google Play store or Apple app store. When you open the app you will see an automatic prompt which asks you to open the ‘surprise. Clicking on that will give you 30GB of data for three months, with a monthly cap of 10GB.
