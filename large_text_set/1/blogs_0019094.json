There was a 20-foot drop between them and the water.\nThey were traveling southbound on Interstate 5 just north of County Road 22 when the winds turned ferocious.\n“The truck started vibrating more and the wind started gusting and the rain was really strong,” Jose said.\nHe knew he had to get off the freeway, but not the way Mother Nature attempted.\n“I felt the truck kind of jumping like this; I felt it moving then I just went over,” he said.\nHe described it like the truck tipped over in what felt like cyclone. He and his wife thought this would be the end as they went over the edge of the bridge. The truck continued to move and he was afraid the rest would flip over, sending them on a 20-foot plunge into the water they likely wouldn’t survive.\nThen they saw a light from the fire department.\nThe Castros were able to get a look at the damage on Thursday, which was minimal when they think about what they almost went through.\nBut the harrowing experience won’t keep them off the road for long. They hope to get back behind the wheel soon, together as always.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T04:34:42.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
