Twelve spots remain to be claimed in the 30-man battle royal, the winner of which will move on to a main event title match at WWE WrestleMania 33 . Three titles from the red brand will be defended at Royal Rumble 2017 , as Roman Reigns challenges for the Universal Championship, Bayley challenges for the Women’s Championship, and Neville challenges for the Cruiserweight Championship.\nWho else will announce their entry into the 2017 Royal Rumble Match on this week’s Monday Night Raw? [Image by WWE] With United States Champion Chris Jericho suspended high above the ring in a shark cage, WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens will defend his title against Roman Reigns. While there is one more Monday Night Raw- branded PPV before WrestleMania 33 , it seems likely that whoever leaves the Royal Rumble as the Universal Champion will hold that title until April 1 in Orlando. After KO powerbombed Reigns through the announce table to end WWE Raw last week, how will Roman respond this week ?\nPutting her incredible PPV title match winning streak on the line at Royal Rumble 2017 , Charlotte Flair defends the Raw Women’s Championship against Bayley. Despite multiple opportunities, Sasha Banks was never able to defeat Charlotte in a PPV title match. Will Bayley be able to accomplish what The Boss never could? And after Bayley had the last laugh during her encounter with Charlotte last week, what will Ric Flair’s daughter have in store for Bayley this week?\nFinally, with twelve spots still open for the Royal Rumble Match, how many more Monday Night Raw superstars will join Goldberg, The Undertaker and Brock Lesnar in the 30-man battle royal? Some WWE Superstars from the red brand that could still enter this Sunday night’s main event include Enzo Amore, Big Cass, Big Show, Bo Dallas, Goldust, Karl Anderson, Luke Gallows, Rusev, Sami Zayn, and any of the competitors from 205 Live (with the exception of Neville and Rich Swann, who will be competing in a Cruiserweight Championship Match). With Goldberg being booked as one of the “odds on favorite” to win — and everyone expecting a Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg rematch at WrestleMania 33 — what will be on Goldberg’s mind just six days before Royal Rumble 2017 ?\n\nRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR \nWWE Fantasy Booking: Who Should Win the Royal Rumble?
