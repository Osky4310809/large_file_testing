She was brought to the shelter in desperate need of help, which she received straight away.\nWhile healing, Peanut’s former owner was convicted of animal abuse – and Peanut was able to put everything in the past as a new, loving family adopted her, welcoming her into their home with open arms.\nBut it seems this family aren’t the only ones doing the saving – as Peanut’s instincts led her to rescue a little girl.\nPeanut’s new-owner, penned a letter to Delta Animal Shelter to let them know of the events.\nStarting the letter by first letting the shelter know what a ‘blessing’ she has been to the family, and how happy she was to have taken her into her home to give her the love and care she deserves, the owner went on to say she thinks Peanut may have a ‘sixth sense’ about ‘her past life that she has carried with her’.\n\nShe explained: ‘Today, Peanut was responsible for saving the life of a 3 year old little girl. About 11am this morning, Peanut started going crazy at our house. She was running up and down the stairs, barking and yelping.\n‘She then went and got my husband, who was in the garage working on some projects, and alerted him that she wanted to go outside. He said he could hear her running around upstairs but didn’t understand why.\n‘He let her outside where she went barrelling into the field behind our house at full speed. My husband followed her and to his surprise, he found a naked, shivering, 3 year old girl curled up in a ball.’\nThe owner’s husband picked up the little girl, wrapped her in his sweatshirt and took her back to their home after calling both an ambulance and the police.\nAccording to the owner, the only thing the little girl could say was ‘doggie’.\nShe continued: ‘Thanks to Peanut, a little girls life was saved today. She has been such a blessing to us, and now to others.\n‘Words cannot express how grateful we are that we have Peanut in our lives and how amazing she is. She is a part of our family now and thanks to wonderful people like you at the shelter, she is alive.\n‘Without her, not only would she have been gone from this world, but the life of this little girl might have been taken as well.’\nOn 20 March, Delta County Sheriff’s office confirmed Peanut’s owner’s story to be true.\n\nIn a statement made to Facebook, they wrote: ‘On 3/17/17 at approximately 11:15am, Deputies from the Delta County Sheriff’s Office responded to the Rapid River area for the report of a 3 year old girl found lying naked in a ditch.\nMore Woman speaks out after her amazing weight-loss photo was deleted from Instagram \nThis rainbow unicorn candle that cries rainbow tears is the ultimate hipster gift \nA real-life 'Mary Poppins' manual has been found \n‘The temperature at the time was approximately 32 degrees. A citizen was alerted to the child’s presence by his dog. The citizen then located the girl and wrapped her in his shirt and rushed her back to his residence in attempt to warm the child.’\nLuckily, the little girl was found unharmed but was transported to St Francis Hospital by UP Health Systems.\nHer parents were located, and further investigation unveiled their property to be unsafe with unsanitary living conditions, Child Protective Services were contacted and the little girl, along with another young female living on the property were removed from the residence.\nMORE: Families meet adopted rescue dogs for the first time \nMORE: One of Britan’s oldest rescue dogs is looking for a home at the age of seventeen ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:45:03.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
