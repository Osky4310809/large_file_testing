Arsenal vs Hull City Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \nAfter losing just one league game in the opening 15 fixtures of the campaign, Arsenal have now been beaten in four of their previous nine. \nWenger insists the club win together and lose together and does not believe a perceived drop in form from Sanchez and Ozil can be credited as the reason behind Arsenal's stuttering results. \n\"The team wins and the team loses. When you win sometimes some players are singled out as they are treated like exceptional players, but when you don't do well sometimes just focus a little bit more on the team aspect and not try to blame each other,\" Wenger said when asked about Sanchez and Ozil. Arsenal have fallen 12 points behind league leaders Chelsea \n\"The blame culture is part of the perception of people, but what is important is that we have a good opportunity to show that we are a united strong unit and that we bounce back. \n\"When you don't win you cannot as well say that all is well. You have to analyse that something is not right. It is our job to find where and to have a strong united response.\" \nWenger's position continues to be questioned by a section of Arsenal supporters, while Saturday's opponents are enjoying an upturn in results since replacing Mike Phelan with Marco Silva. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain says he apologised to Arsene Wenger after his Twitter accident following Arsenal's defeat to Chelsea. \n\"He is doing well,\" Wenger said. \"There are many top managers in Europe. They all come to England. I believe aswell that Hull played well with Mike Phelan but so many times they were not rewarded by results and they had injuries as well. \n\"I felt they played well since the start of the season but they had not always the results. The Premier League is difficult for everybody - they were a bit unlucky sometimes so they are a tough opposition for us.\" \nArsenal's match with Hull City is live on Sky Sports 1 HD and Sky Sports Mix from 11.30am on Saturday.
