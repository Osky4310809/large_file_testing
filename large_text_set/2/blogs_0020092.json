A loving husband and father, Bill began his career in Hollywood working on films in the art department and went on to have an illustrious career spanning four decades as a beloved and prolific actor and filmmaker. Bill’s passion for the arts was felt by all who knew him, and his warmth and tireless energy were undeniable. We ask to please respect the family’s wish for privacy as they mourn the loss of their adored husband and father.”\nIn the course of his career, Paxton faced three of science fiction’s most famous villains. In Aliens , he faced the xenomorphs; in Predator 2 , he faced a Predator; and in The Terminator , he played one of the punks from whom Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character demanded clothes. /Film wrote that this makes him “the only actor to have been killed by a Terminator, a Predator, and a Xenomoprh,” and I personally can’t think of anyone else who can come for that title.\nOne fan has put together a compilation of Paxton’s encounters on YouTube:\n\nPaxton appeared in a number of other genre properties, including Weird Science , Edge of Tomorrow , and the TV show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. He also collaborated frequently with director James Cameron–not only on Aliens and Terminator , but on Titanic and Trues Lies .\nOver his career, he received a number of honors. With the rest of the Apollo 13 cast, he received a Screen Actors Guild Award in 1996 for Best Ensemble. He also received three Golden Globe nominations for his role in Big Love .\n(Via /Film and The Hollywood Reporter ; image via ABC)\nWant more stories like this?
