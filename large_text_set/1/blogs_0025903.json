Chelsea in keeper crunch ESPN FC's Gab Marcotti explains why he believes a move to China for Wayne Rooney is \"extremely unlikely.\" \nThe winter transfer window is now in full swing! As usual, Transfer Talk has its finger on the pulse when it comes to which rumours are picking up steam. Check out all the latest deals here . TOP STORY: Rooney to China rumours persist \nWayne Rooney looks to be winding down his Manchester United career and will quit Old Trafford in the summer, with the Chinese Super League his most likely destination, the Sun reports. \nThe 31-year-old became United's record goal scorer with an important equaliser against Stoke City last weekend, but he has been reduced to a bit-part role under Jose Mourinho. And with reports of interest in Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann , Rooney could find himself further marginalised. \nThe England international has 18 months left on his current deal, and although United have the option to extend that an additional year, it seems unlikely, despite the player wanting to end his playing career at the club. Chelsea's goalkeeper conundrum \nShould Chelsea's attempts to sign Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon fail, they could turn to Paris Saint-Germain's Salvatore Sirigu , who is currently on loan at Sevilla. Brendan Rodgers said on Friday that Chelsea's bid for Craig Gordon was not in line with the player's valuation. \nBrendan Rodgers confirmed on Friday that Celtic had rejected a £3m bid for Gordon , who might yet push for a move to the Premier League leaders, where he could reportedly double his salary. But if the move doesn't come off, Antonio Conte has suggested going for Sirigu, a player he selected for Italy's Euro 2016 squad. \nChelsea's goalkeeper search takes place amid Bournemouth's interest in Asmir Begovic , but with Thibaut Courtois also said to be the subject of interest from Real Madrid, there is the possibility of a potential promotion from No. 2 to No. 1. Rakitic to Man City back on \nIt looked like Manchester City's hopes of landing Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic were nonexistent, but the Manchester Evening News reckons a deal could be back on. \nBarca could be forced into the sale of a top star in order to finance a new deal for Lionel Messi, who is entering the final 18 months of his current contract. \nIt looks like a win-win situation for Pep Guardiola, who would happily bolster his midfield with 28-year-old Croatia international Rakitic, but would also take Messi off Barca's hands should an extension fail to be agreed that sees him stay at Camp Nou. Steve Nicol has his say at the latest rumours, including Man United's reported attempt for Antoine Griezmann. Tap-ins \n- Branislav Ivanovic is set to leave Chelsea on a free transfer before the January transfer window closes, according to the Daily Mirror . The 32-year-old has plenty of options available to him, with West Bromwich Albion, Leicester City, Crystal Palace and Zenit St Petersburg all in the running for his signature. Conte was coy about the Serbian's future but did say on Friday that he wouldn't be in Chelsea's XI for their FA Cup match versus Brentford at the weekend. \n- Should Southampton fail to tie up the signing of Manolo Gabbiadini this month, he will leave Napoli for AC Milan in the summer instead. Saints have offered €16m plus €4m in add-ons, Calcio Mercato claims, but Napoli chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis wants more, something the Rossoneri might be able to afford at the end of the season, when their takeover has gone through. \n- Odion Ighalo could be the man to make way following Mauro Zarate and M'Baye Niang's arrival at Watford. The Daily Mirror reports that Ighalo, who has only scored one Premier League goal this season, is the subject of a £27m offer from the Chinese Super League that the Hornets are currently considering. \n- Aston Villa's extensive rebuilding programme saw them sign nine players under former manager Roberto Di Matteo in the summer and a further five under new boss Steve Bruce this month. But are they finished? Not a chance! Swansea City duo Neil Taylor and Modou Barrow are the Villains' latest targets, according to the Daily Telegraph .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T04:38:44.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
