The fÄ“nix 5S is lighter, sleeker and smaller than previous models â€“ perfect for small wrists without sacrificing multisport functionality. The fÄ“nix 5X boasts preloaded wrist-based mapping; and the compact fÄ“nix 5, like other fÄ“nix watches, is feature-packed and ready to take on any adventure with an all-new industrial design. All of the fÄ“nix 5 models are 24/7 wearable with extended battery life, daily activity tracking, Garmin Elevateâ„˘ wrist heart rate technology, and a host of connected features. And users can easily switch between stylish leather and metal accessory bands to sporty silicone in seconds and without tools, thanks to the new QuickFitâ„˘ bands. With the new fÄ“nix 5 lineup, users now have a watch that compliments their style and adventures.\nThe fÄ“nix 5, 5S and 5X are announcing in conjunction with the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., and will be showcased at the Garmin booth #35811. Additionally, fÄ“nix 5S has been named a CES 2017 Innovation Awards Honoree in the wearable technologies category. Products entered in this prestigious program are judged by a preeminent panel of independent industrial designers, independent engineers and members of the trade media to honor outstanding design and engineering in cutting edge consumer electronics products across 28 product categories.\n\nâ€œAfter years in the wearables market, Garmin knows that athletes and adventurers come in all sizes, which is why we have designed the new line of fÄ“nix 5 watches to fit every wrist and every workout,â€ said Dan Bartel, Garmin vice president of worldwide sales. â€œThis is the first time Garmin has created a variety of sizes for one product so now users don’t have to choose between getting the features they want and wearing a watch that fits.â€\nMeasuring 47mm, the fÄ“nix 5 has a brand new industrial design and is more compact than previous models like the fÄ“nix 3HR, but is still packed with multisport features. All of the new fÄ“nix 5 models are available in a variety of colors and finishes with more accessory bands available (sold separately), which makes the new QuickFit bands a great addition. Users can mix and match between their choice of leather, metal or silicone watchbands and switch between them in seconds with no tools needed. Easier than changing clothes for different occasions, fÄ“nix 5 users just need to swap, click and go to change out their band.\n\nThe first fÄ“nix designed with a focus on female adventurers, the fÄ“nix 5S is a sleek, smallersized watch. At 42mm, fÄ“nix 5S is small and comfortable for petite wrists, without compromising any multisport features. Both stylish and functional, fÄ“nix 5S is available in silver with either a white, turquoise or black silicone band with a mineral glass lens. The fÄ“nix 5S Sapphire has a scratch-resistant sapphire lens and is available in black with a black band, champagne with a water resistant gray suede band or champagne with a metal band. The fÄ“nix 5S Sapphire units also come with an extra silicone QuickFit band.\nPreloaded with TOPO US mapping, routable cycling maps and other navigation features like Round Trip Run and Round Trip Ride, the fÄ“nix 5X measures at 51mm. With these features, users can enter how far theyâ€™d like to run or ride, and their watch will suggest appropriate courses to choose from. Users can also get at-a-glance guidance from their fÄ“nix 5X. During an activity, easy-to-read guidance cues for upcoming turns are displayed as banners on the watch so users are always aware of their route. Additionally, fÄ“nix 5X users can use the Around Me map mode to see different points of interest, waypoints and other map objects within the userâ€™s range to help users be more aware of their surroundings. Users can configure their fÄ“nix 5X to see data overlays on mapping screens, and to see highlight key information without having to switch screens during an activity. The fÄ“nix 5X is available with a scratch-resistant sapphire lens.\nAll of the new fÄ“nix 5 models come preloaded with the full multisport toolset for running, hiking, swimming, biking and more that has made the fÄ“nix line one of Garminâ€™s bestselling wearables. Whether users are on an adventure, or just in the gym, Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology gives users 24/7 heart rate monitoring, without needing a chest strap. In addition to the wide variety of sport profiles, all three fÄ“nix 5 models have daily activity tracking, so users can wear their fÄ“nix as a daily timepiece and a rugged training tool. Built-in navigation features include a 3-axis compass, gyroscope and barometric altimeter, as well as GPS and GLONASS support to track in more challenging environments than with GPS alone. Users can also keep their training stats right at their fingertips with a performance widget that shows training status, training load and more.\nIn addition to the multiport features, the fÄ“nix 5, 5S and 5X boast a variety of connected features. When paired with a compatible smartphone, users can get call, text and email smart notifications right on their wrist. All fÄ“nix 5 models are compatible with Connect IQ so users can customize their watch with apps, widgets, data fields and watch faces. To take watch faces one step further, fÄ“nix 5 watches are compatible with the Face It app, so users can set their favorite photo as their watch face. Sapphire models are Wi-Fi Enabled, so users can connect their watch to their home network for automatic uploads to Garmin Connectâ„˘ when within range.\nEach of the new fÄ“nix 5 models is water rated to 100 meters , and is built to withstand the elements with a stainless steel bezel, buttons and rear case. The fÄ“nix 5 can get up to two weeks of battery life in smartwatch mode and 24 hours in GPS mode. The fÄ“nix 5X can get up to 12 days of battery life in smartwatch mode and 20 hours in GPS mode. The fÄ“nix 5S can get up to eight days in smartwartch mode and up to 13 hours in GPS mode.
