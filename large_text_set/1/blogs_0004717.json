ratifies death penalty for kidnappers if … Lagos Assembly ratifies death penalty for kidnappers if … On 12:56 am In News by adekunle Comments \nBy Ebun Sessou Lagos — The Lagos State House of Assembly yesterday passed a bill aimed at checking the spate of kidnapping in the state into law, with stiff penalties including death sentence for offenders. \nThe lawmakers passed the Law to Provide for the Prohibition of the Act of Kidnapping and for Other Connected Purposes after the third reading. \nThe passage of the bill was also sequel to the adoption of a report presented by Mrs Adefunmilayo Tejuosho, the Chairman of the House Committee on Judiciary, Petitions, Human Rights and Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission, LASIEC. \nSponsored by the Speaker of the House, Mr Mudashiru Obasa, it prescribes death sentence for kidnappers whose victims die in their custody and life sentence for those whose victims do not die in the hands of their abductors. \nThe bill states that any person who kidnaps, abducts, detains, captures or takes another person by any means or trick with intent to demand ransom or do anything against his/her will, commits an offence. \nThe bill also stipulates life imprisonment for anyone who makes an attempt to kidnap another person. \nAlso the bill prescribes seven years imprisonment for anyone making false representation to release a kidnapped or abducted person. \nThe lawmakers also approved 25 years imprisonment as penalty for anyone found guilty of threatening to kidnap another person through phone call, e-mail, text message or any other means of communication. \nThe bill prescribes penalty for any person, who knowingly or wilfully allows or permits his premises, building or a place or belonging to which he has control of, to be used for the purpose of keeping a person kidnapped. \nAccording to the bill, such a person is guilty of an offence under the law and liable to 14 years imprisonment without an option of fine. \nThe speaker, who read the 20 sections of the bill one after the other for members’ approval, conducted a voice vote before its passage. \nObasa directed the Acting Clerk of the House, Mr Azeez Sanni, to forward a clean copy of the bill to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for assent. \nThe state recorded recurrent cases of kidnappings, with the incident affecting students in two schools in 2016. \nIn February 2016, three school girls were seized from Babington Macaulay Junior Seminary, Ikorodu, but were later freed by the police. \nIn October, gunmen stormed the Lagos Model College, Igbonla, Ikorodu, and took away the vice principal, a teacher and four students. \nThey were released after several days. \nAlso, kidnappers stormed the palace of a traditional ruler, the Oniba of Iba, Yishau Goriola Oseni, in July and abducted him. \nHis release was later secured and several persons are on trial over the kidnap. \nAlso at yesterday’s sitting, the House adopted the recommendations of its Committee on Youths and Sports on a Bill for a Law to Provide for the Establishment of the Lagos State Sports Commission and for Connected Purpose after a debate. \nThe bill, seeking to create a commission for sports in the state to administer sporting activities, provides for the constitution of board members, duties and responsibilities, among others. adekunle", "external_links": [],
