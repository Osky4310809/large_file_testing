It did that by injecting CNY20 billion via 7-day reverse repos and another CNY20 billion via 14-day reverse repos in its open-market operations Tuesday, according to traders, while continuing to skip 28-day reverse repos.\nThe move resulted in a net drain of CNY155 billion for the day, and followed a substantial drain of a net CNY245 billion last week - the first removal of liquidity in three weeks. We promptly followed up with a warning:\nPBOC drains a net CNY155 billion for the day. Keep an eye on overnight SHIBOR/ HIBOR/ Repo\nâ€” zerohedge (@zerohedge) January 3, 2017\nJust over an hour later, it appears our warning was warranted, because according to the latest daily fixing of the Treasury Market Association, as a result of the PBOC's massive liquidity drain which soaked up a nearly a third of a trillion Yuan in the past two weeks, the interbank market is freezing again as follows:\n1-month yuan interbank rate in Hong Kong rises 1.16ppts to 13.01%, 3-month CNH Hibor +89bps to 10.02%;\nAnd most importantly, the overnight CNH Hibor rate has soared 4.95% to 17.76%, the highest since September\nBut wait, because the interbank market freezing was not all, and in a repeat of two weeks ago when China's halted the trading of its government bond future, the Shanghai Stock Exchange announced that Shanghai halted trading of the 3.99% government bond due May 2065 after \"abnormal fluctuations.\" It was not exactly clear what that particular phrase meant aside from \"aggressive selling\" as per the chart below.\nAccording to a statement, trading was set to resume at 11:06 am after being halted at 10:36am, but not before the exchange called on investors to \"remain rational and reminded them of trading risks.\" In other words, please don't sell, especially when the central bank just yanked a near record amount of liquidity from the market.", "external_links": ["http://www.cafepress.com/zerohedge", "http://www.sse.com.cn/disclosure/announcement/general/c/c_20170103_4223868.shtml", "http://zerohedge-newsletter.iclnd.com/", "https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/816093509413457920", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/zerohedge/feed"], "published": "2017-01-03T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T06:01:06.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
