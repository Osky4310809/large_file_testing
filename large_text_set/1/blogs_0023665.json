It can be hard to get your bearings. Fear not, would-be victims. I am here to share some tips for making it out alive.\n\nPlay on Normal You’ll initially have two difficulty options: Easy and Normal. There’s actually not too much difference between the two. Easy mode has less monsters, some more items laying around, and the nasty folks who stalk you will have a little more trouble finding you. If this if your first Resident Evil, it’s a good introduction.\nAdvertisement \n\nThat said, I’d encourage most players to stick with the Normal difficulty. There are more monsters and less ammo than in Easy, but the tension and excitement are ramped up. This is already forgiving game. Be confident and you’ll do just fine.\nSave Often Unlike previous titles, you don’t need a special items like an Ink Ribbon to save your game if you are playing on Easy or Normal. You should save often, particularly after major encounters.\nExplore Everywhere There are a few hidden items and puzzles in the game awaiting those who can find them. Dig around, take a close look at your surroundings. You’ll not only get to enjoy the game’s superb art directions and design, you might actually be rewarded for your efforts.\n\nRemember when special doors are and come back to them once you find the key. Explore Everywhere Again If you’re having trouble with supplies, head back to a checkpoint and retrace your steps for a while. Resident Evil 7 isn’t the Caribbean vacation that RE4 or RE5 were. Taking time to backtrack and stock up on spare ammo will help avoid frustration.\nAdvertisement \n\nThroughout the game, you’ll also find special keys. They will help you progress forward but can also be used in previous areas. Remember where locked doors are and double back later for some really good items.\nFully Examine Objects Some the objects you find might seem useless. Don’t be fooled. Rotate the object and look at it from all sides. Boxes will open, keys will be found, and you’ll also discover puzzle hints and lore snippets. Always take a closer look.\nIf You Can Pick It Up, Take It There are a few knick knacks that don’t have obvious uses. Keep them. These are actually the keys to solving hidden puzzles and unlocking items.\nAim for the Head The enemies in Resident Evil 7 are much more robust than the zombies from earlier titles, but headshots still do a lot of damage. Headshots will help you preserve ammo, which you’ll need for boss fights.\nSpeaking of Boss Fights... The bosses in this game take a lot of punishment. Don’t give up if it feels like you’re not doing much damage. Be aggressive and let loose. The game tends to give you a lot of ammo and goodies right before fights. Use them!\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T19:19:15.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
