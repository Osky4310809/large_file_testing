According to The Wrap , who consulted the Wisconsin Department of Corrections’ records, they were also transferred on the same day to the Waupun Correctional facility.\nEvans claims that during this time, he and Avery became friendly, which eventually led to Avery confessing to the murder of 25-year-old Halbach.\n“He said he put the knife to Teresa’s throat as he guided her to his bedroom,” the letter continues. “Steven said Teresa was crying and begging him not to kill her.”\nIt only gets more and more disturbing from there, with Evans claiming that Avery said he would have gotten away with it had his nephew Brendan Dassey — whose release was blocked by a federal appeals court back in November — not spoken to police, as we saw on the critically acclaimed Netflix series.\nEvans also claims, in hideous detail, that Avery coerced Dassey — who is mentally disabled — into raping Halbach’s recently dead body.\nAs expected, neither Avery’s attorney nor the Wisconsin Department of Justice has responded to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nNetflix As it stands, Season 2 of Making a Murderer is currently in production in Wisconsin, with recent reports claiming we might see new episodes by the end of this year. The first season was, again, a colossal hit, but executive producers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos also came under fire for intentionally leaving out details that made Avery look bad — like additional DNA evidence, for example.\n“Of course we left out evidence,” Ricciardi later said at the 2016 Television Critics Association press tour. “There would have been no other way of doing it. We were not putting on a trial, but a film. Of what was omitted, the question is: was it really significant? The secret is no.”\nAvery and Dassey are both currently appealing their convictions, with Dassey’s case set to be heard in front of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals later this month.\nLetters like Evans’ are reportedly relatively common , and are turned over to the State Attorney General’s Office so official investigations can be conducted.\nWe sincerely hope that answers are found soon, for the sake of Halbach’s friends and family.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:33:57.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
