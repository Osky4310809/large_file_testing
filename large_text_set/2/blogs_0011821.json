Title race still alive Sterling and De Bruyne celebrate the opener (Photo: Getty Images) \nThanks to Burnley, who held Chelsea on Sunday, and Manchester City, the title race is still just about alive just. City cut the gap to eight points with this victory, routine win which was not spectacular or sparkling but they got the job done nonetheless. \nIt was a fourth win in a row for Pep Guardiola's men. If they continue that form for the next couple of months their April 5 trip to Chelsea will still be a game that matters. 2. Aguero takes his chance Manchester   celebrates his sides second goal (Photo: PA) \nSergio Aguero ended up playing 75 minutes against Bournemouth. He forced City's clincher and might be about to get an extended run of the team. \nBut any doubt that he is second choice in Pep Guardiola's thoughts was confirmed on the team-sheets. It was the third game running he started on the bench with new kid on the block Gabriel Jesus picked again ahead of him. \nAn ankle injury to Jesus gave Aguero a route back into the team and how long he stays there will depend on the seriousness of the Brazilian's injury. 3. Bournemouth's survival prospects It's starting to look worrying for Bournemouth (Photo: REUTERS) \nIt is starting to look worrying for Bournemouth. They are six points clear of danger in 14th. \nBut with the resurgence of Hull and Swansea there is a growing danger they will be dragged into the relegation dogfight. \nIt is now six league games without a Premier League win and they need to end that sequence quickly to avoid a nervous end to a season that looked set to end comfortably. 4. Flexible Fernandinho Fernandinho (R) was impressive in midfield (Photo: Michael Steele / Getty) \nPep Guardiola love Fernandinho and hailed his versatility earlier this season. He claimed the Brazilian can play in ten different positions and continued his bid to prove that against Bournemouth. \nHe fielded Fernandinho as a left-back and preferred to keep his actual left-back, Aleksandar Kolarov at centre-back. 5. Luckless Jack Wilshere Bournemouth's Jack Wilshere receives medical attention (Photo: REUTERS) \nWilshere left Arsenal for Bournemouth temporarily for regular football and to put his injury problems behind hin. He had been doing that under Eddie Howe and was getting stronger and stronger by the game. \nAfter a shaky start he made a positive impact against City, setting up a chance for Jordon Ibe and then catching the eye with his pressing. \nThen his injury woes struck again when he was forced off before half-time after coming off worse in a challenge with Fernandinho.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:17:27.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
