PSL 2017 was two steps forward, but four steps back at the same time for Pakistan.International cricket, thus, comes as a much-needed tonic for the national side. Beyond the alleged corrupt individuals, PSL has made a positive impact on Pakistan cricket, helping them unearth some fine local talent. A Twenty20 International (T20I) series away from home, against a higher-ranked team will be a true test of potential for the newcomers, who will hope to be more than just PSL specialists.It is also an opportunity for Pakistan to rise up the ICC T20I rankings and make good use of the dividends that the teams have reaped through two seasons of their T20 league. But the task will not be straightforward. They go up against a side known to boss the shortest format, and bolstered by the presence of stalwarts like Kieron Pollard, Marlon Samuels and Sunil Narine. Dwayne Bravo's absence, due to injury, however, comes as a dampener for the T20 champions.Pakistan can take heart from the fact that they blanked their opposition in Dubai just six months ago in the T20I (and ODI) series. With the Champions Trophy coming up, T20I bilateral tours have been sparse, with the Dubai series in September 2016 being the last time both teams played the shortest format of the game. While there isn't a vital bigger picture to the upcoming T20I series, it allows both teams to find form and combinations ahead of the ODI series, which will be highly important for both teams.Top eight teams in the ICC ODI rankings by the September 2017 cut-off date will get direct entry into the 2019 World Cup, while the final two berths will have to be contested in a World Cup qualifier in 2018. At the moment, Pakistan and West Indies are placed eighth and ninth, and could have a lot to play for.
