During Napolitano’s spot on America’s Newsroom today, Bill Hemmer noted that “you’ve had a few quiet days.” \nHemmer then asked the judge whether he was still confident in the story, to which the Fox judicial analyst said yes. \nThe American public needs to know more about this rather than less because a lot of the government surveillance authorities will expire in the Fall and there’ll be a great debate on how much authority we want the government to have to surveil us, and the more the American public knows the more informed there and Congress’s decisions will be. \nNapolitano has been absent from the network ever since White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer cited his allegations in defense of the president’s claims. The White House was ultimately forced to (sort of) apologize to the United Kingdom after GCHQ called the charge “utterly ridiculous.” \nWatch above, via Fox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:40:39.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
