They saw me see it from far away and walked into the back. Told everyone I knew. Slaughterhouse451 ____ \nIt was our favorite bar. We used to live down the road from it. We had our first date there and knew every employee. Even the cooks in the back. We moved about 25 minutes away. We got engaged and needed to save money. We went for the first time in months. The menu changed drastically, the management changed, almost none of the servers recognized us, as most staff had left. We tried to give it a go, but the food was awful, they’d even changed cooks. We realized what we had was gone. sn34kypete 4 \nMexican restaurant I had never been to before. Me and two friends go in, wait for awhile by the door while being stared at by staff, eventually, we sat ourselves. A boy no older than ten years old greeted us after a minute and I asked for a water. He said they didn’t have water. They didn’t have water. They didn’t have water. They didn’t have water. benunciojr ____ \nI worked at this place for one day, It was a deli-type place. I had five years kitchen experience and needed the work in a small town. Within 5min I was questioning their sanitary disposition, with unregulated temperatures, improper disposal methods and general disregard for cleanliness. After a half hour, I told myself I needed the money, could look past it, and do my best to make improvements over time… then came the french fry that broke the camel’s back. Their fryer, they dumped a basket of fries in it, but when it came out, it had a brown film or sludge over the delicious crispy fried potato product. I asked if they were going to serve that to the customer, they said yes, it’s the gravy. After further questioning, I found out they inherited the property and the oil hasn’t been changed in 7 years. After 45min of working there, I quit and called the health inspector. I never looked back. ____ \nWent to a local Mexican place and got a burrito. Took a bite in and found glass. yeosinx3 5 \nWhen I was 3 my parents and I were at a Pizza Hut and when the waiter brought out drinks, he spilled them all over me (all three of us got pop so I was sticky). This in itself wasn’t too bad, but when my parents got the check, the realized that they got charged for two sets of drinks, including the ones that were spilled on me! When my dad asked the waiter about this he said it was only fair, this is the only time I’ve ever seen my dad, not tip. Musef ____ \nLocal breakfast place in my hometown that I went to as a kid. Ordered a Belgian Waffle, and it comes out dark brown and crunchy. I complained that it was burned, and they sent it back to make a new one. About 5 minutes later, they returned with a new waffle. Except it wasn’t new. It had bite marks. Right where I had bitten it… And hey, the section I bit out of had butter on it… They walked in back and turned the waffle over, thinking no one would notice. CorahIlCappo ____ \nThere was a small fly (a fruit fly I think) in my fried egg. It was all fried and crispy. I wasn’t even that bothered, I’m not a confrontational person. I didn’t even want a whole new meal, I just wanted a new egg. The waitress came back from the kitchen and said that the chef was insisting it was a bit of “herb” that he uses in his cooking. You could see the legs and wings. They were so insistent that I could see it wasn’t worth arguing. They were a new business as well so you would have thought they would want to establish a customer base. ____ \nThey lost a lawsuit over stealing server’s tips. Best pancakes/stuffed french toast/breakfast skillets of my life, but I couldn’t do it after that. \nRelated Video: Meanwhile, in the world’s grossest restaurant kitchen… Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:06:00.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
