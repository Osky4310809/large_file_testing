After diving into Google's blog post , we fired up our developer tools and got Android O loaded on a sacrificial device. There are a few new interesting features, lots of UI tweaks, and plenty of odd bugs and unfinished areas. Let's dive in!\nNotifications: Snooze, channels, and a terrible new ambient mode You can snooze notifications! Just slide the notification over a bit and click on the clock. This works for everything. The notification panel topper has a bit of a redesign; there are now status bar elements up there. Long pressing on a notification will bring up a new set of controls, allowing you to jump right to the new notification settings. Apps can now provide on/off switches for custom notification types. System UI one of the rare apps that supports it. Expand to the quick settings and you'll find some of the status bar items overlap. It's definitely a beta. Also check out the bottom of the notification panel. Icons stick around after the main notification collapses. The double-target Quick Settings tiles are back, too. The top half is usually a power toggle, while the bottom half opens a panel. The new Ambient Display (left) sucks. So much information is missing. This is when a new notification first comes in. Subsequent ambient light ups are even worse, showing only an app icon. My favorite new feature in Android O is the ability to do system-wide notification snoozing. If you don't want to deal with a notification right now, just pull it to the side a bit, which will unveil a new \"clock\" icon. Tap it and the notification will be automatically snoozed for 15 minutes, and you can tap on the drop down menu to up it to 30 minutes or an hour. This is really handy, but I'd like to be able to customize the times here. I'm sure some people would like a few hours, or maybe a \"tomorrow\" option. A \"type in your time\" option would be fine, too.\nThe top of notification panel has been reworked yet again. When the notification panel is open, the status bar isn't shown, but in Android O there are now a few status bar elements at the top of the notification panel. You'll see your Wi-Fi, cellular, and battery status, along with the settings gear and the expand button.\nFurther Reading Google announces the Android O Developer Preview We noticed in Google's announcement that a new thing called \"Notification Channels\" would be in Android O, and now we actually have a good example of them. You can long-press on a notification or dig through the settings and tap on an apps \"notification categories\" settings. System UI actually has a working version. Before you could only block all or none of the System UI notifications, but in Android O you get separate controls over notifications for screenshots and storage, along with more ambiguous items like \"Alerts,\" \"General Messages,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\"\nPull down the notification panel to reveal the Quick Settings and you'll see even more changes. The triple-function Quick Settings buttons are back—tapping on the icon does one thing, tapping on the text does a second function, and long pressing on the icon does a third thing. Take Wi-Fi for instance: A tap on the icon turns Wi-Fi on and off, while a long press opens the full Wi-Fi settings. A tap on the bottom Wi-Fi text will open the Wi-Fi panel. It's complicated and hard to remember. Google started this Quick Settings layout in Lollipop, got rid of it in Marshmallow and Nougat, and now it's back in Android O. Flip floppers!\nThere's a new Ambient Display design that is a big regression over the old design. Ambient Display is a low-power notification mode that kicks in when the screen is \"off.\" When a notification comes in, or when the device is moved or tapped on, the screen will light up briefly with a white-on-black UI and show you what your new notifications are. The older method was great—it was just a black-and-white version of the notification panel. This new version is a custom design that shows much less information when a notification first comes in and even less on subsequent viewings.\nTake Gmail: in the old version you got the \"Gmail\" app name, the account, time, contact icon, contact name, and e-mail subject. Now you get the app name, contact name, and that's pretty much it! You get action buttons now (\"Archive\" and \"Reply\"), but they are pretty useless when all you can see is the contact name and none of the message text. This display is what you get when a notification first comes in. After that, all you get is the Gmail icon! This is terrible and just seems unfinished.\nSettings: Lots of improvements, and don’t worry about the unfinished UI The settings are totally new and totally white. Everything has been rearranged. Keep in mind this is the AOSP Android O Settings versus the Google Settings for Android N. There's a new icon too. It's white. It looks bland and hard to see against the white background, but it's probably supposed to be bland. No one ships the AOSP settings anymore. This will be rethemed. The new settings are much shorter than the old settings. Here are the first items from O and Nougat. It used to just be a list of Wi-Fi routers, now it's a comprehensive connectivity page. You can get the same options on different screens now, so there's no more guessing if \"sleep\" is a display setting or a battery setting. There is nothing in Android N like the new \"Apps & Notifications\" screen, which gathers up all the various notification settings into a single The new battery screen. Scroll down for some \"device usage\" stats, and the battery chart still exists. It's just on another screen now. It seems like fine-grained battery data, like this screen from Nougat, is gone, however. Storage gets a new circle graph and a big teal \"Free up space\" button. The new \"security\" page has a big fat \"Security Patch Level\" button at the top. It seems to open the \"check for update\" page right now. The new sideloading app install message. Rather than a phone-wide \"unknown sources\" checkbox for sideloading, sideloading is now limited on a per-app basis. You now get a lot more information about what's going on with the backup system. Pick your Bluetooth codec! The settings app has been totally reworked. Everything is rearranged and condensed, and the design is... well it's different. Settings now has a bland, white theme and lots of funky margins. Even the icon is nearly all white, which makes it very hard to see on the white background of the app drawer. I wouldn't put too much stock into the color scheme of the current Settings app though. Remember these are the AOSP settings, which almost never ship in production devices. Samsung and other OEMs will, of course, skin the crap out of the settings, but even Google now ships the \"Google Settings\" on Pixel devices. The AOSP Setting design looks like a placeholder because it most likely is a placeholder.\nThe Android O settings have been seriously condensed and now are only about half as long as the Nougat version. Things have been placed into logical sections like \"Network & Internet\" for Wi-Fi and cellular options, \"Connected Devices\" for Bluetooth, NFC, and USB devices, and \"Security and Screen Lock\" for encryption, fingerprint, and lock screen type.\nGoogle also took the fantastic step of having multiple entry points for a setting in different sections. You no longer have to wonder if the device timeout setting is under \"Display\" because it's tied to when the display shuts off, or \"Battery\" because it's closely tied to battery usage. You'll now find the option in both spots. For people that would rather browse the settings rather than use the search option, this is a great change.\nI'm also a big fan of the \"Apps & Notifications\" screen. It pulls in all the various app settings and permissions onto a single screen—notifications, app permissions, default apps, special access, and more. One of the things we complained about with past Android versions was that app settings were just all over the place in the settings, and now they're finally in one handy spot.\nThe permissions for \"sideloading\" apps—installing an app from outside of the Google Play Store—work differently now. In older version of Android, there was a single, system-wide \"Unknown sources\" checkbox. In Android O, installing non-Google Play apps works on a per-app basis. The new \"Install other apps\" screen will show which apps have permission to install apps. There are some really silly entries here—is anyone installing apps from the calculator? Does that need to be on this list with a \"no\" next to it? I think it would be better to only include apps which can access the outside world.\nAnother interesting new addition is the \"Backup\" screen, powered by Google Drive. This is basically a big status dashboard for the \"new\" backup system introduced in Android 6.0. Right now everything says \"waiting to backup\" so we'll have to let the phone sit for a few days and see what it does.\nYou are now asked for your lock screen PIN or password when you enable the Developer Options. Inside you'll find the big new option is a selectable mode for the Bluetooth, allowing you to pick from the traditional SBC, or the new, higher-quality options like Sony's LDAC and Qualcomm's AptX. Anyone have some compatible headphones?\nPage: 1 2 Next →", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:03:49.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
