Unsurprisingly, the crowd was extremely down.\nYG had State going 🅱️razy last night #FDT #SDSU #GreenFest pic.twitter.com/SN1RYupgcy \n— Angel G. (@bigjuicy57) March 4, 2017 \n\nSDSU’s Greenfest is all about “sustainability, SDSU Pride, and diversity,” and fans definitely gave props to YG for losing some bands for the sake of spreading his activist message, as you can see below.\nYG really broke a 60k contract to play FDT. And he said If you a Donald Trump supporter well then… Fuck You. This man my idol\n— ¯_(ツ)_/¯🔪 (@impulsivemari) March 4, 2017 \n\n@YG knew if he played Fuck Donald Trump at Greenfest he wouldn't get paid and he fucking played it anyway I'm so wet\n— 3hunnalei (@hanaleii) March 5, 2017 \n\nIn addition to creating the ultimate sonic middle finger to the 45th President, YG had a hugely productive 2016. Red Friday was leaked ahead of its release date back in November. and his sophomore album Still Brazy dropped last summer. We’re stoked to see what’s next for the Balifornia boy.\nUntil the human Cheeto “stops talking out of his neck”, revisit “FDT” below.\n\nNeed more political bangers in your life?
