When it's going bad, it's really bad (\"SELL HIM FOR Â£1 NOW, JUST GET HIM OUT!\") \nAnd it's safe to say recent relations have been nestling comfortably in the \"awful\" zone, if this furious chant after their mauling in Munich is anything to go by, anyway. \nNow Arsenal fans are likely viewing him in an even worse light - and they didn't even have a fixture this weekend. \"For fu... now what?\" (Photo: Getty) \nWith the Gunners having a week off owing to scheduled opponents Southampton competing in the EFL Cup final , the only team in the top four to play on Saturday was Chelsea. \nThey overcame a stubborn Swansea 3-1 at Stamford Bridge, where former Arsenal hero-turned-villain Cesc Fabregas marked his 300th Premier League appearance with both a goal and an assist. (Photo: Darren Walsh) \nA great performance from a man who's struggled to nail down a regular starting place under Antonio Conte. \nAnd in doing so, he's now been involved in more league goals (10) than Mesut Ozil (9) - despite playing a huge 1,227 fewer minutes than the German. \nOh dear. (Photo: Reuters/Getty Images) \nIt's an unfortunate irony that the man Arsenal passed up the opportunity to re-sign has now rubbed salt into the wounds of the their record signing. \nHe may have taken a lot of stick from Gooners since signing for Chelsea, but it's Cesc who's laughing at the minute.
