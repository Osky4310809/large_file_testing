Former England U21 team-mates Nathan Redmond (left), Marcus Rashford (centre) and James Ward-Prowse are all in the senior squad \nThe 26-man group includes Southampton pair James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Redmond, both of whom have played for Southgate at under-21 level but have yet to feature for the seniors, along with the uncapped Michael Keane and Michail Antonio. \nWest Brom midfielder Jake Livermore has made the squad and should get the chance to add to the England cap he won against Italy in 2012. \nWith Tottenham's Danny Rose sidelined through injury, Southgate has selected full back Luke Shaw despite the fact he has made just one Premier League appearance for Manchester United since October. \nEngland squad in full: \nGoalkeepers: Fraser Forster, Joe Hart, Tom Heaton \nDefenders: Ryan Bertrand, Gary Cahill, Nathaniel Clyne, Phil Jones, Michael Keane, Luke Shaw, Chris Smalling, John Stones, Kyle Walker \nMidfielders: Dele Alli, Michail Antonio, Ross Barkley, Eric Dier, Adam Lallana, Jesse Lingard, Jake Livermore, Alex Oxlade Chamberlain, Nathan Redmond, Raheem Sterling, James Ward-Prowse \nForwards: Jermain Defoe, Jamie Vardy, Marcus Rashford Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:26:44.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
