(Have you seen the Dallas Cowboys’ recent rise to victory?!) \nBut, I digress. \nTom Brady is also famously known for being the husband of 36-year-old supermodel Gisele Bündchen. Since getting married in 2009, Brady and Bündchen have had two children, and the model loves showing off the precious family on her Instagram account. Here they are being preciously too short to reach the Thanksgiving spread: Here they are riding horses on the beach like a picture-perfect postcard: And here they are celebrating Father’s Day near a crystal-clear ocean, molding a… mountain (?) into the sand: \nDespite marrying a supermodel and famously being a part of # deflategate (Can you tell I don’t know anything about the Patriots?), Brady has remained relatively low-key. \nBut it seems he decided to get in on the Instagram action, so he can finally post photos of himself in his own private sanctuary. Behold, his first post: \nBrady appears in the snow, embracing it with delight, as he reminds us he’s just a simple Cali boy living life in the harsh Northeastern winters. \nSince joining Instagram 23 hours ago, Brady already has an impressive 741,000 followers. So he followed up his success with a touching father-daughter post: \nAwwww. \nHere’s to hoping his little tot learns more about football than I do. *Clicks follow* \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T01:35:08.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
