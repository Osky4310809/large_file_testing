This kid’s birthday rivaled most of the big blowout backyard weddings we’ve been too, and that’s saying a lot.\nCo-parenting can be hard, but maybe not for Batparents. Sebastian's costume is by @calicr8! #sebastiantaylorthomaz Happy Birthday Pumpkin \nA post shared by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Feb 20, 2017 at 11:35am PST \nKhalifa and Rose, who are divorced, made headlines last week when they shared a very public smooch at a pre-Grammys party. Amber later explained on Instagram that while they are not together, she had just gone through an amicable but tough breakup (with Dancing with the Stars ‘ Val Chmerkovskiy, with whom she was partners with on the show) and Wiz was, and always has been, there for her. They share a son and make one beautiful family, regardless of their togetherness status. We support couples making it work for their kids (and for them!). And if that means the occasional red-carpet-kiss and couple’s costume, we say go for it .\nI can't believe my baby is 4 years old! #sebastiantaylorthomaz by @iamkevinwong \nA post shared by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Feb 20, 2017 at 12:22pm PST \nSebastian (aka, Bash or Pumpkin, if you’re his momma) dug into a gigantic layer cake, danced with little friends to Pharrell, bounced in a bounce house and, we’re guessing, got some majorly impressive presents. Amber shared a few videos on Instagram that also subtly showed off her party-friendly backyard. Can we come over? Please?\nLol Birdman hands #sebastiantaylorthomaz photo by @iamkevinwong \nA post shared by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Feb 20, 2017 at 11:52am PST \nAlso in attendance? Bash’s best bud King Cairo, also four, the son of Amber’s ride-or-die bestie, Blac Chyna. While reports say Chyna was sans engagement ring, she was also at a kid’s party with a bounce house, and we can see how a rock that size may not be the easiest thing to bounce around and chase a kid with. Just saying.\nLol boys will be boys! Happy birthday Pumpkin! #sebastiantaylorthomaz by @iamkevinwong \nA post shared by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Feb 20, 2017 at 11:47am PST \nHappy Birthday, Bash! We look forward to watching this cool kid grow …and to scope out more of these insane parties. Who knew Amber was such a party planner?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:59:22.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
