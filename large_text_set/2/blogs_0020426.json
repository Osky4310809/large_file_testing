Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGareth Bale helped make one Real Madrid fan's dream come true by replacing him for a special film made by Nissan. \nThe Wales superstar was ready to join Manchester City's Sergio Aguero on set for the commercial, but an injury and crutches ruled him out. \nInstead of cancelling the project, Bale and Nissan reached out to Ana Rueda Hernandez, a Madridista from the Spanish capital, to replace him. \nThe part-time baker, student and avid footballer for CD Magerit, was thrilled to receive the call. \n“My life is studying and soccer. In my family, we all support Real Madrid. Every time I can, I’m playing. I need it – it’s like my release,\" said the 24-year-old. \"But I still don’t believe it. I never thought I would do something like this in my life.

Gareth is my favourite player anyway – I wish I had the same left leg!” \nNaturally Ana felt the nerves of stepping up to replace the former Tottenham star, but Aguero was able to help settle her down. \n“At the beginning I was really nervous, but after a few minutes we started speaking in Spanish and telling each other about our lives, he was great.” Bale was on crutches and therefore unable to take part (Photo: Nissan France) Aguero and Ana pretended to drive at full speed for the commercial (Photo: Nissan France) \nThe pair seemed to click throughout the film with Aguero screaming his head off as the pair mimicked driving the Nissan GT-R at the 196 mph full speed, before a series of football skills exercises and acrobatic stunts from high-standing beams. \nThe day only got better once filming ceased with Bale himself making a late appearance and give Ana the chance to meet one of her idols. \n“It was awesome,\" Ana remarked. \"It’s definitely a memory for a lifetime.” poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:57:15.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
