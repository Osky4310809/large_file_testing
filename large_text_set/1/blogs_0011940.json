The Jefferson Memorial is pictured on Jan. 12. ( Erik Cox Photography via Flickr ) \nIt’s Jan. 12, the dead of winter, but Washington has come to life with 70 degree temperatures. The May-like weather has brought out walkers and al fresco diners in droves. \nThrough 3 p.m., the temperature had soared to 72 degrees at Reagan National Airport, the District’s official observing site. \nDulles International Airport posted a temperature of 69 degrees, obliterating its previous record for the date of 63 from 1995. \nThese temperatures are 25 to 30 degrees above normal. \nReagan National’s 72-degree temperature is the highest posted in the month of January since 2013 (on Jan. 30, when it was also 72) as noted by Capital Weather Gang information lead Ian Livingston . It also ranks among the top 30 warmest January days in D.C. on record. However, it is still several degrees shy of the District’s record high for the date of 76 set in 1890, when temperatures were measured at 24th and M streets. \nSeventy-degree temperatures aren’t totally out of the norm in D.C. during January thaws. Top 30 warmest January days. Jan. 12, 2017 not yet added to this list. \nThursday is actually the 55th time since 1872 that the District has reached 70 or higher in January. So this happens about once every three years on average. Since 2000, we’ve had eight days at 70 or higher in January (including Thursday), suggesting that the frequency may be starting to tick up a bit. \nThe warmth is merely a tease as temperatures will fall on Friday and a frozen mix of precipitation is predicted on Saturday. \nWashingtonians, understandably, aren’t quite sure what to make of this bipolar weather. It is creepy warm outside. And then we're getting an ice storm on Saturday? awesome https://t.co/7qeUkgczDd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:20:30.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
