To get negotiations going - a process that has a two-year time limit- the U.K. government has to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets out the formal steps that have to be taken. \nThe U.K.'s representative in Brussels Monday informed the EU Council's President, Donald Tusk, of next week's move. \n\"The Government is clear in its aims: a deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe â€“ a new, positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union,\" Davis added in his statement. \nThis story is developing.
