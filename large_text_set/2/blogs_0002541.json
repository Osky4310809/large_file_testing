The state of Minnesota has also joined the suit , while several other states have filed their own.\nIn Ferguson’s complaint, the attorney general details several cases where Washington residents were affected by the order. One case involves an Iranian-born Facebook employee who was in Canada watching his little brother perform in a high school play. According to the complaint, the employee was advised by his immigration attorney to rush back across the border before the executive order took effect.\n“The President’s Executive Order of January 27, 2017, is separating Washington families, harming thousands of Washington residents, damaging Washington’s economy, hurting Washington-based companies, and undermining Washington’s sovereign interest in remaining a welcoming place for immigrants and refugees,” the complaint reads.\nLawyers from Trump’s administration argued in a response that Washington state doesn’t have the authority to challenge the executive order and that Trump was acting within his presidential authority in issuing the order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:59:18.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
