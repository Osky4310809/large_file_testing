UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 8 hours ago 0 Following its debut appearance at the Wacken Open Air 2016 festival, the hologram of late Ronnie James Dio is set to embark on a tour this year.Jeff Pezzuti, the CEO of the company behind the hologram, told Talking Metal : \"For the tour he's going to have different looks. [At the Wacken show] he was somewhere around '88, the ' Dream Evil ' era. For this next tour we're going to be somewhere later than that for certain songs and maybe earlier than that for other songs.\"The tour will be an over-the-top mind-blowing experience. We are going to have both live singers with Ripper Owens and Oni Logan as part of the show as well as Ronnie appearing throughout the show at different parts, some duets. \"It's going to be mind-blowing from the fans' perspective. We are going to bring album covers to life. We are going to bring things that are known to Ronnie to life onstage.\"Ronnie will be involved in each show from probably six to seven song a night that he will be singing on. Some of the ones we can expect are ' We Rock ,' ' Holy Diver ' and ' Rainbow in the Dark .'\"In case you missed it, you can check out the hologram's debut show below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:03:16.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
