Now being a portal to digital good times isn’t enough. People are doing real work on these devices. It’s mostly Apple’s fault. The company started a revolution 7 years ago, with the first iPad and, when the market saturated and sales declined, it pivoted to the iPad Pro, a giant tablet masquerading as an ultraportable with optional keyboard and pencil. Soon after Apple delivered the 9.7-inch iPad Pro , thereby solidifying the iPad’s transition to a full-on productivity tool.\nSEE ALSO: The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the best iPad Apple has ever made\nSo, it comes as no surprise that Apple’s chief competitor in all mobile technology, Samsung, has followed suit with an expertly crafted, 9.7-inch productivity tablet. Like the iPad Pro, it works with an optional, $129 keyboard. Like the iPad Pro, it works with a Bluetooth pencil. Unlike the iPad Pro, Samsung’s S Pen comes with the tablet.\nConsidering the excellent quality of the pen, this is not an insignificant fact.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 is just 6 mm thick and weighs less than a pound.\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nBut let’s leave aside the exquisite, nearly perfectly-designed S Pen for a moment and focus on the tablet proper.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 looks so much like the iPad Pro 9.7, it could charitably be called an homage. There’s the matching screen size and resolution (2048x1536), the near matching dimensions (the Tab S3 is slightly thinner and lighter), the single home button with integrated fingerprint sensor on the face and even the quad speaker grills.\nThis tablet is ready for work.\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nThe 13 MP camera takes sharp, color-rich photos\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nThere are, obviously, differences. While Apple still uses an aluminum body chassis, Samsung chose to put glass on the back, giving the device a nice, upscale feel.\nI have no qualms with the iPad Pro’s Retina display, but the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3’s super AMOLED technology is gorgeous, providing brilliant, crisp, vibrant colors (yes, they are sometimes too over-saturated). Android 7 never looked better.\nThe iPad Pro 9.7 beats the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 on benchmarks, but the Tab S3 didn't feel much different in real-world applications.\nImage: geekbench\nPowered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 and 4 GB of RAM the Tab S3 has excellent performance across a wide-range of tasks, even if it benchmarks don’t quite match those of Apple’s A9X.\nI played games like Sonic Dash, streamed video via Netflix, drew, edited Ultra HD video in Power Director and wrote this review in Microsoft Word on the tablet.\nOn games and video, by the way, the quad speakers were loud and sharp.\nS Pen Samsung has made several smart choices with the S Pen. First, it comes with the tablet. That’s an instant $99 savings over the iPad Pro accessory. Second, it never needs charging. The Apple Pencil is one of the thirstiest peripherals I’ve ever owned. I constantly get messages about it being down to 5% power, even when I haven’t used it in a while. Third, the S Pen is significantly smaller, or should I say shorter, than the Apple Pencil. This makes it lighter and a little less unwieldy. I also like that Samsung covered the S Pen in a slightly rubberized finish. It’s really a pleasure to hold. Fourth, they provided a place (two, actually) to store the S Pen when you’re not using it. There’s the tab on the Pogo Keyboard and a hidden magnet on the back of the tablet. Since I have the keyboard, I keep it attached there. The magnet on the tablet won’t do much when I throw the Tab S3 in my backpack.\nSamsung's S Pen is a perfect companion for the Tab S3. Our only complaint might be the button, which we hit too often when we don't mean to.\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nOkay, the button is useful for the lock-screen note taking. Two presses while the pen tip is near the screen and you can write and save reverse notes like this.\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nThe S Pen's 0.7mm tip offers both precision and excellent on-screen mobility. I loved drawing with it, especially because the S Pen includes palm-rejection, so I can rest my hand on the screen while I doodle. Air Commands, which let you hover over the screen and then access a set of hidden features by tapping a Pen icon are useful, especially if you’re someone who likes to grab screen shots (I do), jot random notes (yes, that’s me) and GIF random videos (I could learn).\nWhile these photos are not original size, they give you a good idea of how the two tablets handle colors differently.\nImage: lance ulanoff/mashable\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S3’s 13 MP camera takes excellent, distortion-free photos that tend to be a bit more color-saturated than those of the iPad Pro’s 12 MP iSight camera. They’re also, thanks to 1 more megapixel, a little more detailed. The 5 MP front-facing camera is useful for Skype, but I wasn’t thrilled with the Selfie camera that automatically tries to fix your face.\nUltra-ultra-portable I’m glad Samsung sent me the $129 Pogo keyboard to test with the Tab S3. It’s not as thin and light as Apple’s Smart Keyboard but otherwise accomplishes the same tasks in much the same way. Like the iPad Pro, the Pogo keyboard, which doubles as a cover, connects to the tablet via magnets and a smart connector. Apple puts theirs at the end of the keyboard cover, Samsung puts the connector in the middle. Thus, the Pogo is a tiny bit less flexible than the smart Keyboard. I could not, for instance, find a way to use the Pogo keyboard as a stand that only raises up one edge of the tablet, say, 45-degrees — a useful angle for drawing.\nYou connect the Pogo keyboard to the Tab S3 in much the same way as you would an iPad Pro to the Smart Keyboard.\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nThe Pogo keyboard may be thicker and heavier than the Smart Keyboard, but it offers an excellent typing experience.\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nOtherwise, though, the typing position is virtually the same as the Smart Keyboard. Typing on the Pogo Keyboard is a pleasure; the island keys offer a surprising level of travel for such a thin keyboard. Even though it’s roughly the same size as the Apple’s taffeta-fabric-covered Smart Keyboard, the physical keys are better defined and offer excellent response. I like typing on Apple’s Smart Keyboard. I love typing on the Pogo.\nThe tablet is also an excellent multitasker, letting you easily create split screens between virtually any apps (those that don’t work in multi-task mode will offer a warning). It’s a capability the Tab S3 shares with the iPad pro and is critical for a true productivity product.\nMulti-tasking with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 is a breeze.\nImage: screenshot\nAnd gaming was smooth as silk.\nImage: screenshot\nThe measure of a good ultra-portable is battery life and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 didn’t disappoint. It generally lasted a full day of mixed use. Charging, by the way, is performed via the Tab S3’s USB-C port.\nFractured ecosystem There are some issues, most of which revolve around the Samsung ecosystem.\nI used Samsung Flow to transfer files between a Samsung Galaxy S7 and the tablet, but the set-up was a huge pain. The instructions failed to tell me I needed Flow running on both systems and even when I did get both apps running, it took me a few tries to connect. The biggest issue, though, was that the app appeared to be designed for a portrait-only screen. I had the tablet in the Pogo keyboard and the Flow app insisted on running sideways. I saw this with other Samsung apps. That’s just sloppy and reminds me of how weird Samsung’s extra Android ecosystem can get. Similarly, I found it odd that the Chrome Browser was hidden in the Google Folder while I had the non-descript Samsung browser owning prime home-screen real-estate. Please, Samsung, I don’t want or need your browser.\nAwesome, a place to put the pen!\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nNothing I’ve said here diminishes the Apple iPad Pro, itself an excellent and powerful productivity tablet. However, from a value standpoint, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, which starts at $599, with the included S Pen, for the 32 GB model (and offers the ability to upgrade storage without buying a different tablet – not possible with an iPad Pro) wins.\nIf I were an Android person, I’d spend the $728 to get the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and Pogo keyboard and never look back.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S3 The Good Light weight • Excellent design • Great performance • Great value • Awesome S Pen\nThe Bad Samsung apps that still don't know they're on a tablet.\nThe Bottom Line With the Galaxy Tab S3, Samsung has solved the Android productivity tablet conundrum.\nWATCH: Indulge your fear of heights with China's latest glass bridge", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3bvWWfGB_ZnWG7tDS4aTrraS0mY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421279%2Fd2f53594-b8f1-4aa2-b227-11a03597a998.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dcFRIep_rA9B3_0odoS3BWyLxks=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421292%2F3f58a783-9eb6-4703-bef1-45f0cbc494d9.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GTHn4FN8Hq_4U6wYcWrgZsDXUU8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421287%2F45a748c0-36e8-42c6-b178-d7ba9b3e0908.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/g90Uoi3bu0MDxBjfaBzmpe6QvHM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421281%2Fdab53b96-de56-4e6d-9a16-4b52589b0136.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2F2tCIil2CR_OsotTxAYeTe48KY=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421291%2Fe7c2a1c4-f40f-4844-a0db-db92e64e6907.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/F-g8rI9aRLMFKMU0vIqOqErYasA=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421282%2F3fffa985-f363-4b04-b726-b7d0c80c5d22.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1KMe6TwNRosA-xmfSM3Aqf2OPbU=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420108%2F6fc5fb14-8280-4591-ae9d-b0adef722f81.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ClvHfXLzsQ-wjK2RfMyCLb5urwg=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419883%2F12b7e998-4e5a-47ee-aaa9-1857abdb0170.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0QsyZxgD0_9eZ8NTH02cW0vGep8=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421282%2F3fffa985-f363-4b04-b726-b7d0c80c5d22.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CmnDkPkZK0w9yMwTv5uRSrSJbmU=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419864%2F9c07ebac-9706-408f-a864-89f2628a05cf.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FfZb4aNvScqpTnkTl6_jUtwCqaE=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419883%2F12b7e998-4e5a-47ee-aaa9-1857abdb0170.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/rgQB8NjD.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gGh1zYDDMiYZQelw8JVMa0zpTGw=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421279%2Fd2f53594-b8f1-4aa2-b227-11a03597a998.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/U5nDtqwyfl1_ITpTdLZ3pHb-Xtk=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421280%2Fd7a48672-202f-4778-90a7-1d8af3f950ba.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/rgQB8NjD.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aWsZFI5sbX6WOh9cwNK0Roi-aUM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420106%2F12bfa835-de60-448e-90ab-a61ec98b3971.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4KRmWTrkwH50HJ0WkfH0cfZ9vuc=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F421290%2F2096a415-f174-4007-b9f0-418385bae2bb.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0NyasHVQMPsFDHqAf4MQ_gvA3cM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419864%2F9c07ebac-9706-408f-a864-89f2628a05cf.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-22T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:13:57.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
