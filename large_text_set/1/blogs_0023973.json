ESPN FC's Gab Marcotti discusses what's next in store for Wayne Rooney \nWayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard have all spoken of their desire to get into coaching recently, but how would the three Premier League legends fare in the job? \nRooney is training to become a coach and says he is keen on getting into management when he retires -- though that looks some way off as the 31-year-old striker just surpassed Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time scoring record at Manchester United by scoring his 250th goal, and has a contract until 2019. \nGerrard, now retired, is back at Liverpool as an academy coach, while Chelsea's all-time leading scorer Lampard has spoken of his desire to get into coaching once he hangs up his boots for good. \nThe trio have been some of the best players the Premier League has ever seen, but here's a look at their prospects in management. Wayne Rooney \nManchester United's record goal scorer would have to rewrite the history books again if he wanted to become a decent manager once he retires from playing. Even learning from Sir Alex Ferguson, arguably the greatest manager of all-time, hasn't been enough for many players who turned to coaching after hanging their boots up. \nNotable qualified successes include Laurent Blanc, who managed France and won Ligue 1 with Bordeaux and Paris Saint-Germain, and Stoke boss Mark Hughes, who has forged a respectable career in the Premier League. But of Sir Alex's 31 former players to turn to management, there's more failures -- Gary Neville, Teddy Sheringham, Bryan Robson, Paul Ince, Mike Phelan -- than successes like Blanc, Hughes and Jaap Stam, who has begun brightly with Reading. \nThere's also a question of discipline, a key component in a manager's repertoire. Rooney was at his best when he played on the edge, with a spark, and although that often spilled over into unruliness it was the payoff United bought into when they gambled on his talent as an 18-year-old. \nIt's difficult to imagine Rooney swotting up on xG (expected goals, to the uninitiated), embracing analytics and the tactical side of the game as a boss. He's a throwback to a bygone era, rambunctious and bustling, but that will only take you so far -- especially in the cutthroat world of management. \nThe 31-year-old has paled in comparison to the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic (35) and Ryan Giggs when it comes to extending his playing career; he hasn't been able to see his decline coming and manage it accordingly. Giggs, for example, embraced yoga to continue playing until 40. \nRooney may be softly spoken but he commands respect in the United dressing room and the players admire his character. He has won it all at the club in a career of highs and lows, but so did the likes of Robson and Roy Keane and, despite the latter briefly shining as Sunderland boss, the pair have proven a glittering career and iron-will only get you a step of the way. \nHe'll always know how to score, though -- so perhaps a less pressurised role as an attacking coach on the backroom staff could be the way forward. -- Alex Shaw Steven Gerrard \nThe fact Gerrard is starting his coaching career from the bottom and not using his illustrious CV as a player to jettison him into a better role shows what a level-headed individual he is. It is one of many reasons why he can be a successful boss. \nGerrard should be make for a brilliant man-manager, having experienced all the extreme highs and crushing lows during his 19-year playing career. There should be no-one better equipped to know what a player needs and how to get the best out of them. \nEveryone at Liverpool was quick to praise Gerrard's humility and presence as a leader. However, it will not simply be a case of Gerrard walking into a dressing room and expect all his players to listen because of his achievements on the pitch. No, he is an extremely intelligent thinker of the game -- something which his recent pundit work on BT Sport has proved. \nHe played under five managers at Liverpool and observed each of their methods and tactics in preparation for when he moved into the coaching side of the game. \nGerrard, who turned down the chance to manage MK Dons, will carefully assess his options when taking the plunge for his first job in management. But first, he will work his way up the ladder at Liverpool's Kirkby academy and get some much-needed experience under his belt. -- Glenn Price Steven Gerrard has taken the first steps on the managerial ladder by returning to Liverpool as a youth coach. Frank Lampard \nNo member of England's \"golden generation\" is more embedded in the culture of coaching than Frank Lampard. It's in his blood; from 1994 until 2001 his father held the position of assistant manager at West Ham under Harry Redknapp, his uncle via marriage. \nLampard worked with both until his Â£11 million move to Chelsea in 2001, and in 13 years at Stamford Bridge he regularly won the biggest trophies in the sport as a senior player in partnership with a wide range of managers, including two all-time greats in Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti. \nWorking with top coaches is, of course, no guarantee of becoming one, but Lampard has other strings to his bow. \nIt's often said that great players generally don't make great managers because they can't find a way to communicate with those far less talented than they were, but Lampard's greatness came more from his relentless drive to improve than his natural gifts. \nAs well as respecting his achievements, it's not hard to picture players being inspired by his attitude -- or imagine that Lampard's natural instinct to learn and adapt would serve him just as well in the dugout as on the pitch. \nMuch of the challenge of succeeding as a manager is picking the right jobs (just ask Neville about Valencia). Lampard is smart and politically savvy enough to distinguish between good and bad opportunities, and he is under no pressure to take the first offer that comes along. Though following Gerrard's example by starting at the bottom might be best for his long-term ambition of managing Chelsea -- Liam Twomey. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T12:52:05.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
