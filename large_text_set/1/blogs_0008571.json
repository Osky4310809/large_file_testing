Also believed to have punched this hole in pic.twitter.com/dOpRJyremD \n— Jordan Raanan (@JordanRaanan) January 9, 2017 Following the game, it was clear that Beckham was frustrated by backlash he anticipated about the Giants’ boat trip earlier in the week. Beckham said that wasn’t the reason the team lost on Sunday. \n\"I went through practice,” Beckham said. “Had zero drops, zero missed assignments, there was nothing that could connect seven days ago to today and how we came out and played and executed.”\nBeckham was also surprised by the outcome. \n\"I didn't expect the game to go this way today,” he said. \nThis isn’t the first time Beckham has reacted this way following a tough loss. \nAfter the Giants’ 24-19 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16, Beckham walked through the tunnel from the field to the team’s locker room “growling” to himself. He then banged his head against the wall three times. He was escorted into the locker room by security staff and Giants owner John Mara. \nOdell Beckham was growling to himself, losing it outside locker room. Team security & John Mara guided him into locker room eventually pic.twitter.com/ebdB8dH787 \n— Pat Leonard (@PLeonardNYDN) December 23, 2016 Beckham is an emotional player, and Carolina Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis spoke on NFL Network’s NFL Gameday Morning about the way Beckham’s reactions on the field can impact his team. \n\"When you think about Odell and what he's able to do on the football field is truly special. But it's very important for him this weekend to make sure that he controls his emotions,” Davis said. “Whenever he goes out and he plays and he controls his emotions, he's huge for that team. But when he goes out and he allows his emotions to get the best of him, he's a cancer for that football team and you can see it, it's evident.\"\nBeckham kept his emotions in check during the game, but the aftermath of the loss was a different story.
