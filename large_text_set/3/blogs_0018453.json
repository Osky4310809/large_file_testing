Dog attacks are said to to be on the rise (Photo: Moment RF) 2. Take your shirt off. \nAnd put it around your arm. You want to protect where the ulnar and radius (the bones in your forearm) flow because that's where your major arteries are. \nSo if you are giving the dog your arm in defence, give them your forearm, not the inside, which is where the vital arteries are.
