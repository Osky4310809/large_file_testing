Nokia flagships with Snapdragon 835 SoCs and dual cameras expected to launch in June By March 8, 2017 “The Nokia flagships will allegedly sport 23MP dual cameras” \nHMD Global launched a couple of budget Android-powered Nokia smartphones at MWC. The brand is also rumoured to be working on a couple of Nokia flagships, and a new report by Chinese publication MyDrivers suggests that the devices, allegedly dubbed the Nokia 8 and 9, are expected to launch in June this year. The report has also revealed a few key specs of the phones. \nAs per the source, the Nokia flagship smartphones will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processors. The phones will flaunt 23-megapixel dual cameras at the back. The phones will not sport Carl Zeiss camera technology as the brand confirmed it’s no longer in partnership with the company. The report also suggests that the two Nokia flagships will come with 4GB and 6GB of RAM respectively. Unfortunately, the source didn’t reveal anything else regarding the other specs of the phones. We expect the rumour mill to come up with more details in the coming weeks, so stay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T09:13:43.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
