However, one account does stand out among this dank closet of retrograde opinion: @NoToFeminism .\nA parody account created by Australian writer and comedian Rebecca Shaw, the hilarious account (which has even been published into a book ) skewers the arguments of women who say they don't need feminism, one garbled self-hating tweet at a time.\nSEE ALSO: CNN and Kellyanne Conway's Twitter feud just escalated hilariously\nIt's not like the account tries to hide its intentions. Its tag line is \"lol feminsim no thanks.\" Its pinned tweet is this spectacular bon mot:\nI don't need femims women can't be leaders what if they get periods?? They might start a war over a bad reason! a thing men have never done\n— WomanAgainstFeminism (@NoToFeminism) February 9, 2015\nAt some point on Saturday, the tweet \"I don't need femims I like sex with men like I like my President: Screaming incoherently into the night & obviously unfit for the position\" would have appeared in Conway's Twitter feed.\nDid she chuckle quietly to herself? Inquiring minds want to know.\nI don't need femims I like sex with men like I like my President: Screaming incoherently into the night & obviously unfit for the position\n— WomanAgainstFeminism (@NoToFeminism) February 4, 2017\nI don’t need fimsms because feministss think women should be superior but I am an EGALITARIAN which means i believe eagles are superior\n— WomanAgainstFeminism (@NoToFeminism) January 3, 2017\nShaw said she first realised Conway followed her joke account about one month ago. \"I was just extremely pleased. It's very funny, to me. It's just perfect that someone so oblivious would be following an account like this,\" she said in an email.\nNot a fan of Conway, Shaw said she wasn't sure why Conway would follow @NoToFeminism.\n\"I assume it's because she saw the handle or a tweet and decided to make some kind of statement, without realising that it's a parody.\" she said, \"That happens a lot, but not usually with people who are meant to be smart enough to be given access to the leader of the free world.\"\nSince the discovery, people have been encouraging Shaw to tweet at Conway, and she said she's considering it, if she can think of \"something suitably funny.\"\n\"I suppose I should try and trick her into engaging with me seriously, but it might make me too depressed,\" she added.\nIt's so amusing to me that Kellyanne Conway follows @NoToFeminism pic.twitter.com/pYa1TjBkaB\n— Bec Shaw (@Brocklesnitch) February 7, 2017\nWhy and how did this happen spectacular follow happen? We've reached out to the White House to ask this very important question, with its serious implications for national security.\nBONUS: The hidden clues lurking in the 'Stranger Things' Season 2 trailer", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NoToFeminism/status/816269224121204736", "https://twitter.com/NoToFeminism", "https://t.co/pYa1TjBkaB", "https://twitter.com/NoToFeminism/status/827987863811739648", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/jYsBcNd0.m3u8", "http://www.simonandschuster.com.au/books/No-to-Feminism/Rebecca-Shaw/9781925475340", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/jYsBcNd0.jpg", "https://twitter.com/Brocklesnitch/status/829076231358255104", "https://twitter.com/NoToFeminism/status/564764588986494976"], "published": "2017-02-08T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:15:56.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
