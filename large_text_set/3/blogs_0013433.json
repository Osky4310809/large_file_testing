The slings and arrows of the American fashion industry tear me down. I feel fat. I feel ugly. I feel abnormal, bloated, simply too big to be allowed. I feel like I should have done another round of weights or biked another few speed intervals. I used to be a size 6. Then I took some medication, and over the course of nine months, I gained a roly-poly, curvy-wurvy, bouncy 50 pounds. It happened so slowly. And then one day I looked in the mirror, and I saw myself. I saw fat. \nAfter some struggle and rage, I began to come to terms with my new body. I am 5-foot-6. I wear a size 14. And bitch, I am fabulous. \nHere’s a secret though: I don’t always feel fabulous. And when I don’t, I turn to Europop for the answer. In my head, maybe quietly under my breath, I start singing: “Big girl, you are beautiful / Diet Coke and a pizza please/ Diet Coke, I’m on my knees / Screaming, “Big girl, you are beautiful!” \n\nThe song’s not just some Britpop candy-flip, and Mika didn’t write it that way. It specifically mentions The Butterfly Lounge, Orange County’s first size-acceptance club. Slant calls it “a discofied-exaltation of Queen’s ‘Fat Bottomed Girls.'” I call it my Britpop savior. It’s so earnest, and so dancy, and so exuberant. So my deep secret: I am singing Mika in my head. Right now. As you read this. I can’t stop. And bitch, I am fabulous. I’m saying that right now too. I say that a lot. Because I am. And so are you. \nI’m not joking. My body is fucking fabulous. I have curves for miles. And I’m in good company. Ashley Graham has snagged the cover of Sports Illustrated , and she’s perfect at size 16. Hunter McGrady, who graced SI ’s Swimsuit Issue in nothing more than body paint, told People that she loves her body now as a size 16. No less than traditional-beauty-worshiping Maxim says she “stuns in spray paint.” And voluptuous, gorgeous, Mad Men siren Christina Hendricks rocks a size 14 like nobody’s business. These women look amazing. These women look fabulous. And they are around the same size as me — or bigger. I look like Christina Hendricks , people. OMG. Excuse me while I go worship my mirror. Elizabeth Broadbent \nI’m just on the cusp between plus-size, extra large, and large. It depends on who’s making and where I’m buying. I learned to wear shapewear to smooth everything out — not to make it smaller but to make the curves more aesthetic. They still bounce and flounce and curve and wiggle. They just don’t bump out in weird ways. And I learned to wear clothes that flatter what I’ve got. I don’t wear empire waists, for example, because lots of the weight settled in my tummy. Tight with shapewear? Bangin’. Empire-waist flowy? Pregnant. My best dress clutches my tits, ass, hips, and thighs. It looks phenomenal on me. I catch men watching me walk down the street. Add some high-heeled sashay, and I am amazing. \nIt helps that I haven’t given up. I never looked in the mirror, saw a bigger body, and saw a non-person. I always saw a woman. And that woman likes product. I prefer red lipstick. I like gold eyeshadow. My makeup routine involves 20-plus steps and finishing spray. This does not count my hair. And no, I do not give myself contoured collarbones. That’s some bullshit right there. I also wear dresses almost every day because I can, because they look good, and because I love it — it’s what I feel the most confident and comfortable in. I deserve to dress well. I deserve to have people compliment me. \nI also deserve to be cuddled, and that starts with my kids. I remember, when I was small, how much I loved to hug on my grandmother. She felt squishy and soft and good. As I type, my 3-year-old is using my ample thigh as a pillow. It’s a nice thigh. It has some stretch marks, and it doesn’t belong to Kate Moss, but it’s a lovely thigh nonetheless. It serves its purpose and does its job well. \nThey also love to pillow their heads on my tummy. My squishy-squashy, lovely tummy, the one smattered with stretch marks from carrying them. When I wore the wrong clothes, I was mistaken for pregnant, and I learned to hate it. It was devastating to me at the time. Then I figured out how to dress, and I slowly came to love my body’s graceful curve. High-waisted bathing suits rock it out, as do rash guards. \nI can’t lie — I still struggle. It’s hard to feel fab when you know assholes like Milo Yiannopoulos would take your pic and slap the caption “ fatty ” on it. Sometimes I don’t believe my husband when he says I’m gorgeous because he married a size 4, not a size 14. But he says I look amazing. So I try to keep myself away from the haters. I surround myself with body positivity. I sing Mika. And most of all, I remind myself: It is a fundamental human right to love the skin you’re in. Every curve, every jiggle, every stretch mark is me, and I am amazing. I am beautiful. Bitch, I am fabulous. \nAnd you are too, no matter what size you are, and don’t you forget it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:52:49.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
