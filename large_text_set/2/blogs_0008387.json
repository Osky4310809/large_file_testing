Feb 10, 2017 9:57 AM \nStrange I thought they made the Super Bowl this season Feb 10, 2017 10:11 AM \nDidn’t realize the Falcons axed their D Coordinator over that choke fest. Can’t say I blame them, but dang, that’s harsh. atlatlatl says: Feb 10, 2017 10:17 AM \nAtlanta is treating their Super Bowl loss the way many teams treat not making the playoffs at all. I like it. They’ll be back. peyton42 says: Feb 10, 2017 10:58 AM \nAnybody who thinks the Falcons are going to be also-rans next season is just practicing wishful thinking. This team is loaded with young talent entering it’s prime on both sides of the ball. They just need to get meaner on the DL and they could use a FS. This team is set.

Guy was a beast of a player. Manuel went up the coaching ranks quick. I feel like I was watching him play safety years ago, maybe I just got old quickly. Didnt Marquand ask Eli Apple if he was gay?
