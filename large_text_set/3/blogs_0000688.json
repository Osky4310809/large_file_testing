He's been at the center of two hilarious but unfortunate bloopers in back-to-back games. \nThe one on Friday night is definitely the more unfortunate one of the two, since it cost the Wizards two points. When playing defense goes wrong ðŸ™ƒ pic.twitter.com/jMtRqBT1n8 â€” Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) March 4, 2017 \nThat counted as two for the Raptors' Cory Joseph, and Toronto went on to win, 114-106. Poor Gortat. \nThis is what happened to him the game before this one on Wednesday: He got accidentally smacked in the face with a pass from his own teammate, John Wall. Gotta keep your head on a swivel ðŸ‘€ #SCNotTop10 pic.twitter.com/2IfETuxklf \nAt least he has a good sense of humor. Question is who will make @SHAQ ing-a-fool???
