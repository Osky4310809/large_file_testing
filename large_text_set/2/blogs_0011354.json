Shortly after the conclusion of that game, David Luiz posted a picture of himself in a surgical mask and hospital gown, with an overlay of a needle, some drops of blood, and the words “Hahahaha” and “let’s do it”. Presumably he wasn’t just doing some sort of Joker cosplay. Chelsea play down David Luiz injury concern despite social media post https://t.co/Y1m21GeZMK — Telegraph Football (@TeleFootball) February 13, 2017 According to Law’s sources, the treatment that David Luiz was receiving was just a normal part “the ongoing management of his knee problem” , which stems from Sergio Aguero’s “tackle” a few months ago. The report does go on to claim that David Luiz will be rested for Chelsea’s next game, coming up this weekend against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup. The lynchpin of the three-man backline was likely to be rested regardless (alongside most of the rest of the usual starting lineup), but now it’s even more crucial to get patched up properly. If needed, he could probably even miss the game two weeks from now (home to Swansea City) to ensure that he’s good to go for the rest of the season.
