The project is best viewed from a moving car as the movement allows the photo and terrain to synchronize perfectly. \nIn the language of billboard advertising this kind of reading is referred to as a Burma-Shave after the shaving cream company of the same name who used sequential placement to create messaging that could be read only from a moving vehicle. Within the desert empire of roadside signs, Bolande chooses to advertise the very thing so often overlooked. Looking up at the billboards our attention is drawn back to the landscape itself, pictured here as a stuttering kinesthetic of real and artificial horizons.\nA post shared by Desert X (@_desertx) on Mar 3, 2017 at 3:21pm PST \n\nA post shared by JULIA WALCK (@juliawalck) on Mar 14, 2017 at 6:03pm PDT \n\nRelated Laughing Squid Posts Monochrom & BLF: The Great Firewall of China at Google Billboard Liberation Front Hits Stella Artois Billboard In New York City Newcastle Ale Billboard Shadow Effect Created by 3000 Bottle Caps ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T02:06:19.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
