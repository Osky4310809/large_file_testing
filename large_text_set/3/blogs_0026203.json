Health & Fitness Over half of men say they donâ€™t benefit from a woman's access to free contraception \n52 percent of the men surveyed said they have nothing to gain from free contraception for women, a new study reveals Thursday 23 March 2017 17:24 GMT Click to followES Lifestyle Male contraceptive: a positive change? Shutterstock / Adrian_am13 \nOver half of men say they have \"not personally benefited\" from a woman having free access to birth control , according to a new US study. \nThe study , conducted by Washington-based public opinion research firm PerryUndem, surveyed over 1,000 people about contraceptives through a gender lens. \nIt found that 52 per cent of the men said they have nothing to gain from women in their life having access to free contraception. \nThe highest demographic to say 'no' were men aged 60 and over. \nBirth control is estimated to account for more than 30 per cent of the increase in the number women in skilled careers from 1970 to 1990. \nAccording to a Planned Parenthood fact sheet , \"Being able to get the pill before age 21 has been found to be the most influential factor in enabling women already in college to stay in college\". This is how your birth control method can affect your sex life \nIn addition to stopping unwanted pregnancy, birth control also stops the spread of infection, controls hormones and according to the study, plays a major role in equal treatment for women. \nThe same study found that while around seven in 10 women say access to affordable birth control is an important part of gender equality, the same proportion (around 76 per cent) of men said that they should be able to have sex for the purpose of pleasure, without having to worry about getting someone pregnant. \nSome 1.34 million women accessed sexual and reproductive health services each year in the UK, while currently, 75 percent of women aged 16-49 years use some type of contraception.
