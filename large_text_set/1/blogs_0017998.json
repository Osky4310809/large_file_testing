San Francisco, which went 2-14 under Kelly, set a franchise record with 13 consecutive losses and ended the year at the bottom of the league in most offensive categories. \nKelly told CSNBayArea.com recently that he would take his time to determine his next career move. \n“I’m not going to close the door on any opportunity, but I have to be very smart in what I do next,” Kelly said a couple of days after he was fired. “I don’t have to take anything, but I wouldn’t rule anything out. I need to make sure that I’m in the right situation.” \nWith every other head-coaching vacancy around the league filled (except the 49ers'), and no reports of other teams showing interest in the unemployed head coach, Kelly might have to consider a return to college. Earlier this month, he told Fox Sports reporter Bruce Feldman it was something he was open to. \n\"I evaluate all jobs individually,\" Kelly said. \"I wouldn't rule anything out. I never said I'm only looking at one thing.\" More Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:48:36.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
