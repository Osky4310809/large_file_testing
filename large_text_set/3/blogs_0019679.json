(@westicles69 via Twitter) \nThe car’s driver, carrying a pair of knives, then abandoned the vehicle and ran toward the Parliament. \nThe building was immediately put on lockdown after the knife-wielding attacker fatally stabbed a police officer — and was then shot to death by other London cops. \nSpeaker says Trump should not address U.K. Parliament \nWitness Rick Longley told the Press Association that he saw a man crash a car into the gate outside of Parliament just opposite Big Ben. The man exited the vehicle and approached the police officer. \n\"A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman,\" Longley told the Press Association. “I have never seen anything like that. I just can’t believe what I just saw.” \nThe White House was quick to offer support to its British allies. \nBaghdad car bomb attack kills at least 23, wounds dozens more \nThe U.K. “has the full support of the U.S. government in responding to the attack,” he added. \nThe NYPD announced that it had re-deployed long gun teams to the British Consulate, City Hall and Grand Central Station after the attack. \nBangs and gunshots could be heard around 2:30 p.m. local time as Britain's House of Commons was suspended. Members of Parliament told the BBC they heard \"three or four gunshots.” \nA heavy police quickly filled the area, and news crews reported that two people were seen lying within the grounds of Parliament.

(Stefan Rousseau/AP) \nA police officer was seen with his foot on what appears to be a knife while pointing a gun at a man on the ground — apparently the mortally injured attacker. \nMetropolitan Police Commander B.J. Harrington said “a full counterterrorism investigation is underway” and police presence around the city has been ramped up for the evening rush hour commute. \nJayne Wilkinson told Sky News she saw a middle-aged man carrying a knife \"seven or eight inches long.\" \n\"He was running through those gates, towards Parliament, and the police were chasing him,\" she told Sky News. \nAt least 10 people were treated on the Westminster Bridge, according to the London Ambulance Service.

When he looked up, Sikorski said saw multiple people lying on the pavement. \n“People started running up to them,\" he told TVN24. \"I saw one person who gave no sign of life, another man was bleeding from his head.\" \nPrime Minister Theresa May was in the building at the time of the attack, and was seen being ushered away by plainclothes officers, according to Sky News. She was later reported to be safe and unharmed. \nThe London Eye was also placed on lockdown with many riders still in the inside its cabs. One visitor from Madrid tweeted a photo from the towering obersvation wheel, adding that he'd been up there for more than an hour. \nLondon was already on alert for the funeral of former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, which is scheduled for Thursday. The attack comes a year to the day of the Brussells airport bombing that killed 32 people. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:36:29.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
