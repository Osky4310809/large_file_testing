Giphy \nAND WE ALL LOOK LIKE THIS WHEN WE TAKE OFF OUR SHIRTS. \nAnyway, besides bragging about what I have packed underneath this T-shirt, I want to talk about the Oscars again. \nMainly, I want to discuss what was quiet possibly one of the worst secondhand embarrassments of my life: \n“La La Land” being pronounced the winner of Best Picture because of a card mix-up, when really, “Moonlight” won the award . Oscars 2017: Best Picture confusion To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nUgh, excuse me while I dig my own GRAVE. I hate this. \nWhile most of the cast and crew of “La La Land” looked a mix of confused and heartbroken, the camera focused for a mere second on Ryan Gosling — who apparently thought the whole thing was fucking HI-larious. Twitter \nBut he wasn’t giggling because of the situation — he was giggling because he was so gosh darn relieved. \nIn an interview at the Adobe Summit , Gosling revealed, \nWhat really was happening as I was watching, it was surreal anyway, I was watching people start to have this panicked reaction in the crowd and guys were coming on with headsets and I felt like someone had been hurt. \nI thought there was some kind of medical situation, and I had this worst case scenario playing out in my head. And then I just heard, ‘Oh, “Moonlight” won,’ and I was so relieved that I started laughing. \nI TOTALLY GET IT, RYAN. I TOO ALWAYS JUMP TO THE WORST POSSIBLE SCENARIO IN MY HEAD. \nWhenever I hear anyone laugh in public, I assume they’re laughing at me. \nWhenever anyone calls me on the telephone, I assume someone I know has died. \nWhenever I take off in an airplane, I assume it is going to crash. \nYou know, quirky stuff. \nThanks, Ryan. I needed to hear that right now… \nGosling went on to say, \nI was also so thrilled that ‘Moonlight’ won, I know the director… I’ve worked with them before. It’s such a groundbreaking film, made for a million dollars, an incredible achievement, and I’m so happy for them that they were being recognized. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
