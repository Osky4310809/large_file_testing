The spontaneity that Alia reflects on screen, is every much evident in her media interviews as well. Anyway, coming to the point, many believe when she could excel in serious space why should she go for the so-called dumb variety of entertainment. “Nobody can tell me, what should I do and I should be able to everything. I don’t want to be pigeon-holed. And nobody can say that this space doesn’t have emotions. It does comes across as light-hearted and it does have lot of humour but that is harder to do. You are creating something from the scratch. You have to make people believe that these two people are in love. It is very difficult.” She makes it look easy and natural. In fact, her chemistry with her co-actors has been an outstanding feature of her short career. This is her third film with Varun Dhawan and the bonding is apparent. “I think that is my job as an actor to make it believable. You have to make the pair look desirable. It is not something as a bonus, it is a must. I see it as a mandatory thing. You got to bring the raw energy every time.” \nOn the surface, the film looks like yet another version of The Taming of the Shrew where the small town, less educated boy stalks the ambitious/arrogant girl for marriage. “I know many people think that way. We are not promoting teasing and stalking at all,” counters Alia. “Badri wants to get married and he tries to woo this girl. It is more in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way. The girl’s aim in life is not just to get married. She wants to have a career. She has an ambition. And that is a new thing for the boy. He comes from Jhansi, the girl is from Kota, the coaching capital of the country. I am not saying it has to do with small town but there are boys who are brought up in such a way that they believe that every girl’s only aim in life is to get married. There is a clash of thought process here,” Alia reasons. This, she adds, also makes Vaidehi different from Kavya of Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania . “She was happy with her lehenga and shaadi. Vaidehi wants to fly.” \nGirl as liability \nIt was the first 20 pages of narration by director Shashank Khaitan that drew Alia into the project. “I liked his humorous funny take on how a section of society differentiates between a girl and a boy. Like the boy is equal to asset, the girl is equal to liability. I found it interesting. It is a serious issue but it is not taken upon as a preachy way. There is fun, emotion and message.” \nAt an age when actors do films for fun, Alia says, she wants her films to live on. “Like Meryl Streep’s Sophie’s Choice . It was released ages ago; I was not even born. But the the fact that I am talking about it means that it has traversed across generations. I want my films to be like that. So that mothers tell their children that they should watch this film. Not every film in one’s career can be timeless, but some film should be.” \nIt is hard to imagine timelessness for something like Badrinath .... “Here the relationship has a very universal, timeless kind of feeling. See, we are moving backwards as time is progressing,” Alia suddenly moves on a different tangent. “These days everybody gets offended by the slightest of things. It was not the case, earlier. It is said that more you grow the more forward looking you become, but here we are moving backwards. So such films can become relevant once again.” Well, she might be contradicting what she said sometime earlier but that’s the honesty of the young actress. Like her characters, she doesn’t talk in absolutes. \nThe International Women’s Day is round the corner but Alia feels it is not the day for women to feel important. “Women should feel important every day. I believe it is a day to make boys remember that women are important in their lives.” As a young girl, Alia says the most important thing in a relationship is not love but respect. “Love will be there but you cannot survive on love alone. There has to be mutual respect for a relationship to last. In fact, respect forms the foundation of a relationship. If you don’t respect, you don’t trust the other person.” \nIn a short span, she has played some tough roles. Alia admits they have left an impact on her psyche. “ Highway left lot of memories. Udta Punjab was a very uncomfortable experience. These experiences make you stronger. You hear about them but when you are acting them out, it is very troublesome. At the end of the day, you feel grateful for the life you have. I am fortunate that such things are discussed during dinner table conversations in our home. So, I had some idea where these characters come from.” \nThe Rottweilers \nTalking about home, she was recently in news because of a death threat that her father Mahesh Bhatt received about her. “My father calls it an occupational hazard. He and my sister Pooja are the two Rottweilers at home. They, particularly Pooja, always keep an eye on what’s happening around me. So, all is sorted for now,” laughs Alia. \nThere are talks of her doing Aashiqui 3. “I am not interested in doing a film on the basis of a good story. I want a proper screenplay.” Is she playing pricey for the home production? “It is a valid thing. A story could sound good on the basis of beginning and end but I want to know what and how it happens in the middle. My inputs were taken. Now it is in writing process. Let’s see.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T12:18:17.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
