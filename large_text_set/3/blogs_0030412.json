It’s a teaching moment for the kiddos. Your little ones can learn the yes’s and no’s of recycling, and know they’re being a big help with their simple action. Win, win! \n2. You’re doing Mother Earth a favor. You guys, the amount of plastic we throw away each year is enough to circle the earth FOUR times . That’s plastic alone! Tons of these plastics can actually be recycled. By taking care of our planet now, we’re ensuring our kids will inherit a healthy place to live. In a way, we’re actually helping your children, grandchildren, and generations to come. \n3. It’s one less chore for you. We all know this: The simpler it is to do something, the more likely we are to do it. If you’re already on top of recycling in the home (high five!), you should still consider adding a bin to your bathroom to minimize the work. No more carting those recyclables all the way to the kitchen bin! \nTime to get your ducks in a row and start recycling ;) \nLastly, here are some VIP facts about recycling, courtesy of Care To Recycle® , a program of Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. Visit caretorecycle.com to learn more. \n1. When you throw away recyclable plastic, it can take 100 to 400 years for it to break down. \n2. Plastics with “#1” or “#2” printed on them can be recycled. \n3. Many everyday items are made from recycled items. Mouthwash bottles can be turned into fleece jackets, lotion bottles can be turned into flower pots, and floss containers can be turned into bike racks. How cool is that? \n4. The energy saved by recycling one plastic shampoo bottle could power a computer for 25 minutes. (Whoa!) \n5. Many places will recycle incandescent, CFL, and LED light bulbs. Find your local recycling center here ; they’ll know what to do with them :) \n6. Some broken bathroom electronics are actually considered scrap metal. That means broken hair dryers, curling irons, and other tools can be dropped off at a scrap metal recycling center instead of going into landfill.
