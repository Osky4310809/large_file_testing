Around 1,500 migrants have been sheltering in warehouses in Belgrade (Photo: REUTERS) \nAmin Jahn, from Pakistan, said: \"Actually the cold is too much and last night we didn't sleep, we (were) all sitting around the fire and it was too cold, I think it was minus 16, 15 (Celsius) last night. \n\"Try to arrange something for us and try to open the border. It's our request.\" \nAuthorities say most of Serbia's estimated 7,000 migrants are from Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria. \nDozens of Asian, Afghan and Pakistani migrants, some with children, are camping out in makeshift tents on Serbia's northern border, waiting for their turn to try to enter Hungary.
