For comparison, Jordan Henderson’s equivalent figures are 3.7 and 1.7, but he has scored just one Premier League goal and assisted four more. \nThe Goal report describes the interest as ‘ambitious’ as PSG and Arsenal have both been linked with Keita this week. \nThey cling to the notion that the Guinea international shares an agent with Sadio Mane and he has been impressed in his dealings with Liverpool. Imagine if we manage to sign Naby Keita because we are dead nice to Mane..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T10:23:13.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
