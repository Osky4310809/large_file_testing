Is it true that Akeju is a loyalist of Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu? We should not close our eyes to that allegation just because we hate Omisore over an issue that court has resolved. If the allegation against Akeju is true that means Akeju can not conduct credible elections in Osun and Jega should do something about it. Thanks Tommy \nLet them change the REC hundred times, they cannot change the voters! Aregbesola will defeat all of them hands dawn! Cicero \nAkeju represented Tinubu at a function, isn’t that enof reason to redeploy him, besides being a card carrying member of APC. Elections are not won on pages of newspaper, Osun people are tired of Aregbe anti-people policies. Aregbe is a goner jman \nPdp strategy hahaha u will fall yakata in fact omisore will never win 2 local government. Omogidi \nWho is going to vote for MURDERER OMISOORE ? Not me…. Murtala kadarko \nyes’s ooo we can not vote for Murderer and assassinators we stand by the good humanity Ogbeni Rauf has open our eyes to know all these killers of yesterday, today and tomorrow, but they are killing their generation too unknown to them…..Omugos Bonje \nWhat has the REC done to warrant such a protest. The writer of the story should have told us who these protesters are representing?Then,on what basis?I sincerely do not see anything reasonable in this.Let their Paymaster know that this strategy will not work. \nIt is the hand work of Senator Iyiola Omisore who thinks that removing the REC will facilitate electoral victory. Water No Get Enemy \nOmisore sponsored thugs,they cannot choose who presides over the elections.Changes or no changes Omisore can never defeat Ogbeni Rauf.They are masquerades dancing in the market square,we are watching them with passion. Cicero \nThe issue here is not about Omisore, it is about having an unbiased umpire. Akeju represented Tinubu at a function some years back, isn’t that enof reason to redeploy him, besides being a card carrying member of APC. Take it or leave it, Omisore is already giving Aregbe a good fight for his money. Don’t forget that elections are not won on the pages of newspaper, Osun people are tired of Aregbe anti-people’s policies. samcandid \nGod bless you my brother. Should a card carrying member of APC who also represented Asiwaju Tinubu some years ago at a function be allowed to conduct election in which another Tinubu’s boy is involved? Let us leave sentiments apart here saint cross \nall this useless apc and is supporters TheRockBy aj \nMr Jega should listen to people’s voice and mitigate their concerns, Nigerians must have credible elections. samcandid \nThank you my brother. Some people here comment base on sentiments. I guess they are staunt supporters of APC. I think there is a need for us to be always objective in our contributions. Indeed, this allegation should not be swept under the carpet and should not be politicised because Nigerians want credible elections", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:11:29.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
