P. Howell. Shi Davidi @shidavidi January 31, 2017, 9:28 PM • J.P. Howell could fill void left by Brett Cecil • Blue Jays believed to have interest in adding RHP • Toronto’s 2017 commitments sit around $154M \nTORONTO – The Toronto Blue Jays moved another step closer to completing their off-season business by reportedly reaching agreement with left-handed reliever J.P. Howell on Tuesday. \nThe deal, first reported by Buster Olney of ESPN and said to be worth $3 million pending a physical by Ken Rosenthal of FoxSports.com, aims to fill the void created by the departure of Brett Cecil . \nIf completed, the Blue Jays’ commitments for the 2017 season would sit at roughly $154 million factoring in the $1.25 million Jarrod Saltalamacchia will earn if he makes the team, with another $5 million or so due to players with 0-3 years of service time. \nWith a payroll believed to be in $160-million range, that leaves them right around their limit and suggests they may only have another small move or two left before spring training. The Blue Jays are believed to still have interest in adding another right-handed reliever, and depending where their ceiling is, it’s possible they’ll be limited to rebound-type arms. \nA desire to spread their remaining payroll space around may have led them away from Jerry Blevins , who will be pricier than Howell and likely require a two-year commitment. Blevins and fellow free agent Boone Logan are considered the top lefties still remaining on the market.
