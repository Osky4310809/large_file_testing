He’s broken six of them on the court.” \nI remember someone telling me this when I was a junior at Wimbledon in 1998 and I kept hearing about this kid with the crazy temper, just going mental on the court. \nIt turns out it was Roger Federer. \nNowadays Roger as one of the calmest players on the court but it’s well-know that he wasn’t always that way. \nWe played juniors together at the same time and we were voted the ITF’s No.1 juniors together for the 1998 season. \nThe talk was often about Roger’s temper back then but he was also really nice off-court and you could see his talent and technique early on. \nThe way he was able to turn that around so dramatically and get control of these issues before turning pro is just another reason why he’s one of the greatest ever, not just as a tennis player but as a person. \nWhat we’ve seen him do at the Australian Open this week is just incredible, although probably not that surprising when it comes to Roger.

Roger was there with his Australian coach Peter Carter, who has sadly since died. \nI remember watching him practice and you could tell, with his technique and everything, that he was special. \nThe other thing that sticks out in my mind is that he was always there watching the other matches, even the women’s matches and some of mine. You could tell he really loved tennis. \nHe was really nice to me back then and always has been since. \nThat’s the thing with Roger, what you see is what you get. There’s no act about it and the way you see him on TV, on court or in interviews, that’s really him Fed wins top shelf rally 0:46 \n‘MACHINE-LIKE’ \nMany people think of Roger as somewhat of a late bloomer and forget how good of a junior he was. He won the Wimbledon boys title in 1998 and made the US Open final the same year. \nHe also knew he need to get on top of his emotions and he did that. A lot of players have matured and developed in that way but he has been able to do it to another level because he was quite extreme. \nNow, he’s become one of the calmest guys on the court. You will never see anything negative. His body language is incredible and mentally and emotionally, he’s so stable and so strong. \nSome players are never able to change that sort of thing on-court - and to not show emotion - and I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing. Someone like Goran Ivanisevic comes to mind. Everybody was so entertained by that and, while it’s not always the best thing to do on court, that was him and everyone is individual. \nBut Roger has been able to turn himself into a machine-like player because he’s been able to deal with it. Yes, you mature as you get older but he actually worked hard on that and made sure that didn’t affect his tennis. Roger Federer hits a return against Mischa Zverev.

To display the level of tennis he’s displayed, especially for someone coming off a six-month break, not a lot of people can do that. \nIt’s really special and I think all of us are hoping - nothing against the other players – that he can get to the final and win it. \nThe reality is it’s going to be very tough against Stan Wawrinka. Roger has a great head-to-head record against Stan and mentally he probably does have a bit of an edge. \nBut Stan has been going under the radar, not a lot of people have been talking about him which is surprising because he won the US Open, the last grand slam played. \nI actually think, even though Roger has played so well, he’s probably not the favourite in this match. It’s going to come down to how both guys play on the day. \nA lot of people are starting to talk about the prospect of a Federer vs Rafael Nadal final and that would be incredible, a dream final really. \nIt won’t be easy for Rafa to make it there either but with these two legends of the game, I certainly wouldn’t write it off.
