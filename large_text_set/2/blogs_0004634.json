I began this process a year ago,” Weinberg said. \nWeinberg is of the opinion that the AG’s office will drop all the charges. \n“Because I think we will satisfy them as the criminal process unravels, we will satisfy the AG’s office that we have complied with all of the pre-need funerals,” Weinberg said. \nWeinberg says if anyone has a question or concern about a pre-paid funeral, give him a call at 412-877-0728 . \nTaucher waived her preliminary hearing and paid a $20,000 bond.
