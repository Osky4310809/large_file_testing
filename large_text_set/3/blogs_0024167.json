His first week in office saw numerous protests worldwide, with people of all backgrounds blocking highways in Los Angeles, anarchists punching trust-fund Nazis in the face, and millions of women marching in defense of their rights with the power of the knitted pussy hat. \nThe protests have dwindled since then (though anarchists punching Nazis is still a regular thing), which leaves one wondering: What comes next after the resistance and the protests? One possible answer lies in Quetzal's latest album, The Eternal Getdown . \n\"It's actually a line ... on a song called 'Critical Time' ( Tiempo Crítico ),\" explains Martha González of the album title. \"It's one of the lines toward the end of the song, which is: How do we initiate our people to get down? ... [For] people who are involved in social justice and the struggle in general, how can we not lose momentum and initiate new people? Social movements aren't just about putting out fliers but also about creating generative practices, things that also give us energy and don't just take from us all the time. We're fighting against something but also creating new things.\" \nPolitical music of any stripe tends to be an emotional outlet for aggression and despair. Most of it takes the form of protest music, which is an outlet against an antagonizing force. That protesting energy, however, is unsustainable, because it rarely offers an alternative to the forces of oppression it's fighting against. \nGonzález points to the 1960s and all of the achievements won by radical groups and power movements. The work they put in advanced agendas that propelled people of color and other marginalized groups toward better representation in media and higher education. There has been a massive pushback against many of these progressive advancements, especially during the current administration. Related Stories Quintessential East L.A.

It's not a sustainable mode to be in. You burn out.\" \n\"There's always going to be a challenge but that's really the big question for us in different songs: how to create new forms of social movements,\" González adds. \"There are new ways of involvement in social movements ... so that we don't have to keep reacting.\" \"We feel very accountable to the community that we're from.\" -Martha Gonzalez", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:44:04.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
