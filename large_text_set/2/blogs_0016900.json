The mega successful app has waged a war against nudity and sexual images with its community guidelines and it has even been known to delete entire accounts, including Rihanna‚Äôs and Grace Coddington‚Äôs.\nTheir community guidelines read: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt allow nudity on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.‚Äù\nLuckily there‚Äôs a growing army of sneaky artists who are skirting Instagram‚Äôs community guidelines in creative ways to free the nipple (and much more). Here are 10 artists who are trolling Instagram‚Äôs prudishness with art, illustrations and food that leave little to the imagination:\nGiving & taking in equal measure üå∑ALPHACHANNELING.com prints \nA post shared by Alphachanneling (@alphachanneling) on Feb 19, 2017 at 3:30pm PST \n\nPornhub has been slowly cementing its place in the the arts, one X-rated video at a time. Two years ago they signed a deal with Coolio and recently they produced Mykki Blanco‚Äôs Matt Lambert-directed video ‚ÄúLoner,‚Äù which YouTube later censored.\nAt the end of 2016 they also released a coloring book for ‚Äì you guessed it! ‚Äì adults. In it you can find Alphachanneling‚Äôs smutty illustrations of couples getting down to business.\nSelf-described as ‚Äòutopian erotic,‚Äô the artist‚Äôs aesthetics channel the Kama Sutra with references to the potential emotional and spiritual states these contortionist positions might take you to.\n\"Domino\" #petitesluxures #erotic #eroticart \nA post shared by ‚ù§Ô∏è Petites Luxures ‚ù§Ô∏è (@petitesluxures) on Nov 26, 2016 at 11:42am PST \n\nProving that the French can turn any situation into softcore erotica is Petites Luxures. This Parisian erotic minimal illustration project actually started on the gram. It counts 619k followers and its images are so raunchy that it often gets reported.\nThere is an air of je ne sais quoi to this account: the drawings are half drawn but they reveal just about enough to make this IG very NSFW. The artist has that French ability to turn any quotidian scene into an orgasmic experience, whether it‚Äôs when two girlfriends meet for a bevvie or a couple spilling their freshly made brewed coffee.\nCaught in the act \nA post shared by Stephanie Sarley (@stephanie_sarley) on Feb 1, 2017 at 4:10pm PST \n\nAnyone could be forgiven for thinking Stephanie Sarley‚Äôs account is an X-rated homemade porn channel. At least that‚Äôs what can happen when you watch her video of what initially looks like a pale schlong until you realize it‚Äôs a strudel about to enter the oven.\nStephanie Sarley has a sharp eye, one that sees almost any fruit as an object of sexual desire for her to finger in a very salacious manner. The account has amassed a respectable amount of followers, 196k to be precise, and the artist has also published a coloring book entitled Dick Dog and Friends ‚Äì the title says it all.\nWhat turns me on is turning my partner on \nA post shared by SHELBY SELLS (@sweaterpupz) on Feb 7, 2017 at 10:23am PST \n\nLiberating sexual prowess is Shelby Sells‚Äô mission on Instagram. The artist‚Äôs feed features her own suggestive pictures and videos showing her bikini line, back and crack while pushing the limits of art.\nWhen not focusing on herself, she interviews and snaps other sexually liberated folk, including Mistress Veronica Vixen, who‚Äôs known to wear a bra five times too small.\nUnsurprisingly, Shelby Sells‚Äô account often gets reported, but not for her raunchiness; rather, because some people think she‚Äôs going through a rough patch and might need some help. Perhaps she does, at least she‚Äôs been spotted getting a pair of helping hands from none less than A$AP Rocky .\n\"A Taste\" Now on view through August 31st with a bunch of other pieces at the M√§ntt√§ Art Festival in Finland!!! Really wish I could have made it out there to see all the beautiful work but thanks so much to @kuvataideviikot and @anssikasitonni for letting me be a part of this wonderful exhibition!!

Thank you so much for the love and support! Here's to ending this crazy year and an awesome 2017! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíï \nA post shared by Aaron Tsuru (@tsurufoto) on Dec 9, 2016 at 1:17pm PST \n\nNew York artist Aaron Tsuru can‚Äôt be accused of not being meticulous. Tsuru reflects on their experiences with their partner to sketch illustrations of nudes revealing all of the details of very private parts.\nBy superimposing drawings of pierced nipples on photos of bare breasts, Aaron Tsuru is trolling Instagram big time. The non-binary, agender artist also use their work to voice political statements ‚Äì ‚ÄúGrab them by the pussy‚Äù is the phrase that keeps on giving.\nlmao who made this??? but for #real talk tho it‚Äôs less about actually growing hairy ass armpits/etc and more about being absolved from the shame a divergent decision a person has made w/r/t their body/gender can incite w/r/t it being wrong or gross. and #furthermore we don‚Äôt have to pit (LOL!!!) those whose concerns lie within this realm against issues more pressing. for some v potent expropriation of gender politics pls take note of @thuggerthugger1 who put on a dress again this week and ppl like ‚ÄòUR GAY DUDE‚Äô and he‚Äôs all ‚Äúno i‚Äôm not gay‚Äô and ‚ÄòULGHH juhjuhHGE‚Äô. y‚Äôall can‚Äôt just chill and let the man look good in a tulle dress ??? @sarahlarnach \nA post shared by look at this pussy (@look_at_this_pusssy) on Aug 12, 2015 at 11:10am PDT \n\nTortelloni, a jacket potato or the Roman Coliseum: for this Instagram account, anything can look like a vulva. Or, as the tagline of Look at This Pussy, reads: ‚Äúalmost nothing is not a pussy.‚Äù\nFounded by LA-based Eva Sealove and Chelsea Jones, the feed of this account will make you wonder, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I see this before?‚Äù Some of their most out-there sightings include gari ginger slices, a stairwell and a church.\nGreat art might make you see the world differently, but so does a great Instagram account like this one, which already boasts 158k followers.\n‚ú®Vulvalove! ‚ú®Today I am feeling very happy, it's a sunny day and it feels like spring. So in my happy and loving mood, I want to give you some extra love as well: with every order in my etsy shop today, I will paint a vulvacat for you. Let me know when checking out which color you want it to be, and I'll wrap it nicely and send it along with your order. Thank you all for your support, you are awesome and I love you lots! üíïüñ§üíï #vulvalentinesday #love #positivity #thevulvagallery #vulvaart #vulvacat #vulvalove #happiness #springfeelings #bodypositivity #empowerment #genderinclusivity #bodylove #selflove #loveyourself #hildeatalanta #yay \nA post shared by The Vulva Gallery (@the.vulva.gallery) on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:56am PST \n\nThe Vulva Gallery is not only here to showcase vulvas in all shapes, sizes and colors, but also to educate the public on female anatomy.\nStarted by Hilde Atalanta in Amsterdam, this account prides itself on raising awareness of labiaplasty, the cosmetic surgery that alters the size of the labia minora; that is, the inner folds of the vulva. The feed is replete with cutely drawn illustrations of zoomed in vulvas that for the unaware visitor might even look like muffins.\nApollonia Saintclair 679 ‚Äì 20161001 Le partage (Sharing the loot) FIRST DRAFT #apolloniasaintclair #illustration #drawing #erotica \nA post shared by apollonia saintclair (@apolloniasaintclair_) on Oct 2, 2016 at 2:08pm PDT \n\nApollonia Aaintclair is the account for all your goth-erotic needs. Featuring black and white erotica illustrations this Instagram is so popular that it‚Äôs reached a staggering 216k followers and cult following on Tumblr. The success can be attributed to the the horny heroines that get fingered by masked men, eaten out by long haired women or climb life size erect penises.\nUnsurprisingly, the anonymous artist has already collaborated with feminist porn director Erika Lust to bring to life and in the flesh these surreal and arty, porny moments.\nPussyWisperer‚ù§Ô∏èneener (what I've been workin on) #aintyouaprettygirl #pussywisperer #er√≥tica #erotik #nsfwart #nsfw #nsfwcontent #lowbrowart #lowbrow #digitalart #drawing #blackandwhite #eroticillustration \nA post shared by ‚ù§Ô∏èneenerpants (@neenerpants) on Nov 28, 2016 at 5:37pm PST \n\nJudging by the similarities between @neenerpants‚Äôs creator and the persona in the erotic drawings, it‚Äôs safe to say the artist is inspired by herself. This Instagram may only have just over 6k followers, but that allows for a more personal, intimate and portrayal of girl-next-door erotica.\nJumping between reality, imagination and porny cliches the action depicted in shaky lines includes chicks munching on Wiener sausages and sitting on spray cans. DIY porn doesn‚Äôt get more authentic.\nIf you‚Äôre after more Instagram art, check out 14 of the best artists to follow on the ‚Äògram here . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:22:17.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
