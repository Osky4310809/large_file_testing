And in the new year, there are some fun, new trends that are set to blow up this wedding season. So, if you're getting married this time around, or somewhere down the year, here are some wedding trends from 2017 for you to take inspiration from. Colours everywhere \nFrom flower arrangements to decor, and definitely your outfit, vibrant colours are all the rage for weddings in 2017. Mix and match bright complementary colours, or go through various shades of one colour, but definitely play with hues for your wedding this year. It's all in the details \nWe're sure that if you're getting married, you're already pretty clued in on the concept of using details at your wedding, but detailing is a huge wedding trend this year. From including tiny, personalised elements in your wedding invitations to table settings, and even in you and your groom's outfits, break out all your inside jokes and cute moments to make your wedding even more close to your heart. Greenery in form and colour \nAs the Pantone colour of the year, you can be sure to see a lot of greenery at various weddings this year. Whether in actual foliage form, or as a colour, this lush green shade will definitely be a mainstay on your Pinterest wedding day pages. Social media will be openly welcomed \nWith the increasingly popular wedding hashtags trend, this year will see more and more couples incorporating social media in their weddings. Because everyone's going to be doing it anyway, so why not openly welcome it? Metallics are here to stay \nWhile metallics have been a big deal since last year, the trend is ruling this year as well. So experiment with the trend in your wedding lehenga , or get yourself a metallic cake that might look too good to eat. More interactive entertainment and food \nCouples this year are all about including their family and friends in every aspect of their wedding, so this year will see a lot more interactive activities for the guests to partake in. This includes food counters that are full of life, more bite-sized foods, and fun desserts that go beyond just the cake. Floral arrangements will get a modern update \nWedding day flowers are breaking past clich√©s, with couples using all kinds of unique, soft-blooming flowers like dahlias for their decor. Plus, floral arrangements are set to be bigger and better this year, and are even taking on gravity, with couples opting to suspend their arrangements from the ceilings as well.
