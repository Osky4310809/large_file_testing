As HotForSecurity noted, dozens of email account were targeted by a cyberattack allegedly carried out by a ‘foreign state’, according to the foreign ministry in the Czech Republic, cited by politico.eu. The minister’s own email was also targeted by hackers. \nAuthorities are also investigating whether the unexpected power outage in Ukraine’s capital could be the latest in a series of hacking attacks that have struck the country’s electric grid and financial infrastructure in the last year, as HotForSecurity also noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:36:30.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
