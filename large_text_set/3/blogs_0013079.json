The Bellator president announced via Twitter on Thursday that the California-based promotion had signed Larkin after a 10-bout stint in the UFC. Larkin’s debut is expected to take place soon. Looking forward to seeing @da_MONSOON in the @BellatorMMA cage very soon. Welcome back Lorenz! #BellatorNation https://t.co/e1EEZNrErx — Scott Coker (@ScottCoker) March 16, 2017 Larkin suffered losses in four of his first five Octagon appearances while competing as a middleweight. He had more success after moving to 170 pounds, however, as he posted a 4-1 mark within the Las Vegas-based promotion from 2015 to 2016. “The Monsoon” is coming off consecutive triumphs over Neil Magny and Jorge Masvidal . Prior to that, Larkin went unbeaten during five bouts in Strikeforce, which was led by Coker. During that stretch, Larkin posted notable wins over Robbie Lawler and Gian Villante . The 30-year-old California native owns an 18-5 career mark, with 11 wins coming via knockout or technical knockout.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:12:00.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
