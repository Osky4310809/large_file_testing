Mar 29, 2017 11:56 PM 0 SHARES \nThis was making waves yesterday , after Evelyn Farkas admitted on The Morning Joe show that she and her staff tucked away intelligence regarding Russo-Trump ties for the sake of preservation, to protect it from the onerous bureaucracy she obviously finds to deplorable. Former Obama DoD Deputy Evelyn Farkas reveals White House gathered intel on Trump campaign staff and then leaked it! https://t.co/W6FG4IFe5Q pic.twitter.com/VwaF2CnZzn \nâ€” ZeroPointNow (@ZeroPointNow) March 29, 2017 \n\"Get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration,\" said Farkas in an interview yesterday on MSNBC. \nShe was afraid the Trump people would gain access to their intelligence and whisk it away -- because they're all Russian spies, obviously. \nAside from what appears to be a brazen confirmation of spying on the Trump team, the bigger red flag here is Dr. Farkas wasn't employed by the Obama administration at the time of these so called allegations arose. \nAccording to Pentagon record, Dr. Farkas resigned in September of 2015. \nSo how did this non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, gain knowledge of intelligence regarding members of Trump's team and their relations with Russia, when she was the senior foreign policy advisor for Hillary Clinton at the time? \nFarkas was the prime driver behind the anti-Russia phobia inside the Pentagon during the Obama years -- shilling hard for the Ukraine -- requesting that the President send them anti-tank missiles -- which, essentially, would mean outright war with Russia. \nBack to the interview with Mika Brzezinski. Dr. Farkas said 'we' had good intel on Russia. Who does she refer to when she says 'we?' \nProfessional Deep Stater, Dr. Evelyn Farkas, Globalist Shill \nHere's Mark Levin's take on this scandal. \nPerhaps someone inside the Obama government was leaking to the Hillary campaign? \nContent originally generated at iBankCoin.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:01:11.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
