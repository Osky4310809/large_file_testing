Dennard, the director of black outreach for former President George W. Bush, called the topic \"fake news,\" which upset Lemon. The CNN host cut off Dennard and lectured him on what fake news is.\n\"Fake news is when you put out a story to intentionally deceive someone and you know that it is wrong,\" Lemon said. \"I don't know of anyone who has put out a story in the mainstream media that I can think of right now to intentionally deceive anyone.\"\n\"Please stop it with that stupid talking point that it is a fake news story,\" Lemon added.\nWhen the CNN host went back to Dennard, the conservative commentator began to explain why in his opinion the segment was focused on a fake news story, but Lemon quickly ended the segment and the show before he could make his point.\nLemon has suggested in the past that a tape of Hillary Clinton laughing about defending a rapist was fake and that the controversy over Clinton's private email server was due to sexism .\nThe post Don Lemon Cuts Off Republican Guest Because of ‘Fake News’ appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:36:11.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
