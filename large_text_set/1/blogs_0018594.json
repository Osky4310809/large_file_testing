Lee over bribery charges \nMozilla is setting itself up for a big year ahead. The organization’s flagship Firefox browser, for example, is about to get a brand-new rendering engine . After a few years of missteps and misplaced priorities (remember Firefox OS and Hello ?), it looks like Mozilla, which is more important to the open web ecosystem than most people realize, is back on track.
