He’s been posting multiple photos from the set in Sydney, giving quick glimpses into filming and making us even more eager to see what’s coming up.\nMonday night, Boyega tweeted one of the first official looks we’ve gotten from the new film with the caption “I am Pentecost.”\nI am Pentecost\n2018 #PacificRimUprising pic.twitter.com/36BEwIVRVD\n— John Boyega (@JohnBoyega) February 7, 2017\nIt’s hard to tell what we’re looking at. Boyega is in civilian clothes, not a Jaeger uniform. It’s dark, so it’s difficult to parse what state he might be in. Is this even a still from the film or concept art? Does it even matter?\nWe previously reported that the film was going to be called Pacific Rim: Maelstrom after pictures emerged from the set of scripts and clapboards showing the subtitle. However, that was apparently just a working title.\nThe film stars Boyega following the departure of previous protagonist Charlie Hunnam. Guillermo del Toro, who directed the first film, also left the project but will serve as an executive producer.\nSteven S. DeKnight, best known as a producer on Spartacus and the Netflix Daredevil series, has taken on directing duties and has also been sharing some glimpses from the set. His most recent Instagram post shows a burned government sign with the caption, “Someone’s not paying attention to the warning signs.”\nSomeone's not paying attention to the warning signs… #pacificrimuprising #ppdc\nA photo posted by Steven S. DeKnight (@stevendeknight) on Feb 2, 2017 at 8:01pm PST\nDetails are scarce on Pacific Rim: Uprising ‘s plot, especially after the last film ended so definitively. We don’t have an official synopsis, but we do know some cast members are returning. Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, and Rinko Kikuchi will be reprising their roles from the first film. Uprising will also star Scott Eastwood as a Jaeger pilot named Nate Lambert, which he spotlighted on his Instagram.\nNate Lambert. He’s the ace of the jaeger fleet in #pacificrimuprising . It’s exciting to play this role because we’re both pilots. Aviation has been a large part of my family for many years, and it’s awesome to get in the cockpit of a 200 story robot instead of a plane or helicopter this time around! My dad is a pilot and got me into flying years ago. It teaches responsibility, attention to detail, and an appreciation for nature that is hard to experience otherwise. Thankful for it all!\nA photo posted by Scott Eastwood (@scotteastwood) on Feb 3, 2017 at 5:36pm PST\nPacific Rim: Uprising is expected to hit theaters on Feb. 23, 2018.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/PacificRimUprising?src=hash", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQEku7rDJSe/", "https://t.co/36BEwIVRVD", "https://twitter.com/JohnBoyega/status/828817860013154305", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQCQgwdBYbu/"], "published": "2017-02-07T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:08:54.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
