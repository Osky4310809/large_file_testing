This year, Panasonic will present at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, an exceptional installation and various design products, showcasing state-of-the-art craftsmanship and aesthetic awareness that highlight the theme, \"Electronics Meets Crafts.\" Panasonic's installation will bring to light an aesthetic awareness and allure of space combined with Panasonic's imaging and audio technologies. This outdoor exhibition features an installation where Panasonic's projectors, speakers, and lighting create not only an inspiring space for visitors but also stimulate their five senses through touch and sensation. Through this exhibition, Panasonic promotes the \"Future Craft\" philosophy. With dedication and thoughtful consideration for people and the environment, Panasonic strives to provide a better future for the next century through visionary designs. Detail and refined craftsmanship are inherent in all Panasonic products, which is the company's basic philosophy toward design. Panasonic has been working with GO ON, a joint collaboration of Kyoto craftspeople, who apply time-honoured techniques of Japanese crafts to create inspiring, new designs with international and contemporary appeal. This collaboration leads to the theme of this year's Milano Salone exhibition: \"Electronics Meets Crafts.\" Panasonic's philosophy fits in perfectly with GO ON's collaboration of traditional crafts, materials, and several hundred years of Japanese design heritage. Through this partnership with GO ON, which has been attracting attention in luxury markets globally, Panasonic's exhibition aims to resonate with people, in both their imagination and their five senses. In this exhibition, Panasonic's cutting-edge audio, imaging, and lighting technology will fuse with traditional Japanese craftsmanship. \"Electronics Meets Crafts\" will highlight Panasonic's technologies including vibrating speakers and LED lamps made out of textiles which interact with an innovative induction heating table. Panasonic will also collaborate with Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, the venue of this year's exhibition, and the students of the academy. These next-generation artists will exhibit their installations which will showcase the expanding possibilities of electronics. Michiko Ogawa, Executive Officer of Panasonic Corporation, commented that: \"I am extremely grateful to have developed this project together with amazing partners, such as GO ON and the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, in the incredible city of Milan. We hope everyone can experience dreams and possibilities through their five senses at our installation. Panasonic will continue to contribute to the realization of 'A Better Life, A Better World' through our advanced product design and trust-building craftsmanship developed from a careful consideration of people and the environment.\" Panasonic will pursue the mission to make people's lives better through the fusion of Italian and Japanese sensibilities and technologies, merging traditions and cultures that these two countries have nurtured through their long history. \"Electronics Meets Crafts:\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T06:43:54.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
