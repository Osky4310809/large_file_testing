But only 12 seconds of overtime. \nAfter the Wild managed to come back from four different one-goal deficits in regulation, the 25-year-old Granlund wasted no time in striking the death blow in OT. To say the Kings weren’t ready for it would be a major understatement. Your Browser does not support iFrames. \nGranlund managed to cut through reigning Selke winner Anze Kopitar, Jeff Carter, and reigning Norris winner Drew Doughty like a knife through warm butter before dangling around Jonathan Quick and finding the back of the net. It was equal parts beauty for Granlund and embarrassing for LA. \nThe win gave Minnesota an important extra point as they aim to stay atop the Western Conference heading into the regular season’s stretch run. As for the Kings, at least they got a point as they try to remain in the playoff hunt, though that didn’t seem to be much consolation for Quick.
