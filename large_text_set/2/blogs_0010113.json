She put on a cap, a t-shirt, and even drew on some facial hair. \n\"I was so embarrassed but I couldn't help but smile when he introduced me to his little friends saying 'this is my mom... she's my dad too so I brought her!'\" Whitney wrote on a Facebook, explaining why she did it. \n\"I've tried my best to let them [her kids] know they are loved but I wonder a lot if I'm actually succeeding at it. \n\"When I went to leave he ran after me and hugged me tight around my neck and whispered 'mom... I know that you'll always be there and do anything for me. Thank you. I love you', kissed my cheek and ran off. \n\"I hope he remembers this day cause I'll never forget it or his sweet words.\" \nWhitney says in her Facebook post , which has been shared more than 100,000 times, that when she became a single mum she made a promise to give her children the best upbringing she could.
