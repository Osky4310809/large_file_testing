WATCH: Officer Slams Girl to Ground at Rolesville High School in North Carolina Published Updated 6:51 pm EST, January 3, 2017 2 Comments By Tom Cleary 3.1k Share Tweet Follow (Twitter/ahunna) \nAn investigation is underway after a video was posted to Twitter on Tuesday showing a girl being slammed to the ground by a police officer at a school in North Carolina. \nThe brief video, posted by @ahunnaaa_ , shows an officer lifting the girl off the ground and then dropping her down. The incident occurred at Rolesville High School in Wake County. \nYou can watch the video below: \n— Ahunna (@ahunnaaa_) January 3, 2017 \nThe officer and the girl in the video have not been identified. Officials said the officer has been placed on administrative leave while an investigation is completed, WTVD-TV reports. \nThe officer is a school resource officer and has been with the department since 2013, officials said. Rolesville’s police chief has not yet commented, but plans to speak about it Tuesday night after a previously scheduled town meeting, WTVD reports. \nThe video does not show what led up to the officer throwing the girl down. A witness told WTVD-TV two girls, who are not seen in the video, were involved in a fight, and the girl who was thrown down was trying to break it up. \nA witness told WNCN-TV , the girl “was trying to defend her sister and to break things up.” \nAnother video was later posted on social media showing the fight itself.

That video has not yet been released. Eagles said there are two school resource officers assigned to the high school, and there may be footage from both officers. \nThe North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union told the News & Observer it is investigating the incident. \n“We’re very disturbed by what we saw in the video,” Irena Como, staff attorney for the ACLU of North Carolina, told the newspaper. “This kind of force, especially with kids in schools, in never justified.” \nThe incident is similar to others in schools involving police officers and students, most notably an incident last year in South Carolina. Then-Richland County Deputy Ben Fields was recorded grabbing a girl at her desk and throwing her to the ground. \nFields was not criminally charged, but was fired from his job. \nAfter the video of Tuesday’s incident was shared online, several Twitter users re-posted a video of an incident in October 2016 involving Rolesville Police and a high school student. \nYou can watch that video below: This is RPD in Rolesville Nc ..The boy was treated like dis by police cus he didn't wanna get off the bus.
