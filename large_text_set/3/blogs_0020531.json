El Cholo [Diego Simeone] knows it wasn't impossible for me to come back to Atletico. \n'Kante facts' sadly dispelled \n\"The relationship with Conte didn't start well because when he arrived I told him I wanted to go to Atletico. Chelsea's fans love me a lot, even more than in Atletico, figure that! \n“When Atletico had to wait for me they didn't, there was still a month to go in the transfer market. \n“I've done everything to come back to Atletico Madrid but I wouldn't fight the same to return. When Atletico didn't wait for me, I had to go to Conte with the tail between my legs.” \nWhile ruling out a return to Spain, Costa hopes current team-mates Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois take similar decisions – with both having been heavily linked with Real Madrid. \nHe also refused to close the door on a future switch to the Chinese Super League. \nCosta added: \"In life anything can happens. I don't close the door to anybody. Now I'm fine at Chelsea but you never know. \n\"I hope Real Madrid doesn't get Hazard or Courtois.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:15:07.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
