ADVERTISEMENT \n“They have been contenders all these years,” he said of the Painters, who would need to beat San Miguel two straight times to advance to the Final Four. \n“We beat them only in overtime (in the eliminations) and their confidence is still there. They know they can beat any team in the tournament,” said Austria, whose Beermen will be taking a nine-game winning streak into the playoffs as they search for a franchise-best third straight all-Filipino crown. \nThe Painters shook off a bum start against the Elite, slowly breaking away starting in the second period to win with plenty to spare and snap a four-game losing streak that could help them, mentally, in their clash with the defending champions. \n“We just have to be positive about it,” Rain or Shine coach Caloy Garcia said after the rout of the Elite, who will bow out for the third straight conference after what had been a strong start to the season. “If we want to make the Finals, we will still have to play San Miguel (at some time); they’re the No. 1 team,” Garcia said. “It’s good that we get to meet them early.” \nJericho Cruz came off the bench to shoot 12 points and grab the same number of boards and actually get the Painters out of a rotten 2-13 start. \nThere were six players in twin digits for Garcia, who said that the only way for them to beat San Miguel in their quarterfinal match-up is for them to run at every chance and offset the Beermen’s size advantage. \nArt dela Cruz had 20 points and nine rebounds, with highly-touted rookie Mac Belo finishing with just six points while playing 28 minutes with a hurting left knee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:49:14.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
