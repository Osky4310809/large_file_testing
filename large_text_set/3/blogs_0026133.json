Not one person.\nBut what it does do is show solidarity with each other and, importantly, with those who have suffered.\nMore: UK MPs praise children locked in Parliament during London attack \nFake tube message speaks for whole country after terror attack, says MP \nMan found dead in Wetherpoon toilets by cleaner next day \nIt gives others a moment to reflect as they scroll through news feeds.\nIt is a way of showing camaraderie and letting those who wish to disturb the peace in the UK and beyond know that we are not scared, that we will carry on and that we will live our lives without fear.\nThe use of these hashtags and pictures on social media is the modern-day equivalent of the candlelight vigil.\nYes, practically they are not very helpful.\nLandmarks lit up in solidarity with London after terror attack (Picture: Reuters) But to some, it shows strength in numbers and that despite the numerous social, cultural, political and religious differences in the UK, we are here for one another.\nIt shows that we won’t kowtow to terrorists and that we are grateful to the police, ambulance and firefighters – those who run towards danger when most of us would runaway.\nWestminster Bridge re-opens less than 24 hours after terror attack We are proud of our country.\nIt’s to give comfort to those who feel anxious after these attacks, letting them know that they are not alone – we all feel like that but we all must carry on because to live in fear is to let them win.\nIt may seem like a futile and simplistic response to some people but to others, it can help them feel comforted in uncertain times.\nIf you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. Nobody will judge.\nBut don’t judge those who do – there is already enough hatred, pessimism and negativity in the world.\nMORE: Isis claims responsibility for London terror attack \nMORE: Who was the London attacker?
