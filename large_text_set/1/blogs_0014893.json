The Green Well Rockford will have indoor seating for 120 and capacity for 60 in the outdoor patio area. The interior and menu will be similar to the Cherry Street location but have a Rockford flavor, said Lauren Jaenicke, Essence's marketing and sustainability director. \nThe restaurant plans to hire 35 to 40 new employees to staff the facility.
