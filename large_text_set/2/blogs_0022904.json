She was taken from us too soon, yet we are grateful we were able to have her for the time we did. If you are a Winehouse fan through and through, then you will be thrilled to know that Winehouse will be honored with an exhibit in her hometown of Camden. \nAccording to Nylon , the Jewish Museum in the London borough of Camden will host the installation titled, “Amy Winehouse: A Family Portrait.” The event will display family photos , personal belongings, and Winehouse’s family tree .\n#amywinehouse#love#queen#queenjaz#queencamden#happy#amy#27#rehab#grammy#performance#youknowiamnogood#thersdryontheirowh#backtoblack#album#diva#performance#youknowiamnogood#thersdryontheirow \nA post shared by Amy winehouse (@amy_winehouse_official_) on Feb 21, 2017 at 4:34am PST \nDirector of the Jewish Museum London, Abigail Morris, told Nylon, “Aside from being an immensely talented, iconic and inspirational singer, Amy was also a Jewish girl from North London. It is fitting that the Jewish Museum in her beloved Camden Town should be the place to tell her story.” On top of showcasing items from Winehouse’s Jewish heritage, the exhibit will also display pieces of her iconic wardrobe, her suitcase filled with family photos, and her guitar.\n#amywinehouse#love#queen#queenjaz#queencamden#happy#amy#27#rehab#grammy#performance#youknowiamnogood#thersdryontheirowh#backtoblack#album#diva#performance#youknowiamnogood#thersdryontheirow \nA post shared by Amy winehouse (@amy_winehouse_official_) on Feb 14, 2017 at 4:54am PST \n\n“Amy Winehouse: A Family Portrait,” was co-curated by Winehouse’s brother Alex and sister-in-law Riva in 2013. It first appeared at the Jewish Museum London and then went on an international tour.\nFor the exhibit’s return, the Jewish Museum is teaming up with an organization called Global Street Art. Global Street Art is pulling together an Amy Street Art Trail which leads to “Love Is A Losing Game,” an art installation by Winehouse’s family friend, Pegasus. The Camden-based art trail will feature artists Captain Kris, Mr Cenz, Philth, and Amara Por Dios.\nThe Amy-themed street art will be displayed from March 16th to June 4th. #amywinehouse#love#queen#queenjaz#queencamden#happy#amy#27#rehab#grammy#performance#youknowiamnogood#thersdryontheirowh#backtoblack#album#diva#performance#youknowiamnogood#thersdryontheirowh \nA post shared by Amy winehouse (@amy_winehouse_official_) on Feb 8, 2017 at 5:48am PST \nThe exhibit will run from March 16th to September 24th at the Jewish Museum London. Tickets cost £8.50. If you were waiting for a good excuse to renew your passport, this is definitely a good excuse. Amy Winehouse will live on in our hearts and visiting this exhibit will only deepen your love for her.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:07:15.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
