After partnering with Leica to launch the Huawei P9 ( review ) and releasing the Honor 8 (along with the Mate 9 flagship, which hasn’t made its way to India yet) in 2016, the Chinese company is kickstarting the new year by bringing the dual-camera prowess to the mid range with the Honor 6X . While its pricing or availability is yet to be revealed, we got a chance to spend some time with the device to give you a closer look at its retail packaging along with our initial impressions. \nLike its predecessors, the Honor 6X comes hidden in a compact, blue rectangular box. On prying open the cover, you are greeted by the smartphone. Underneath, you’ll find a SIM-ejection tool, a 2A wall charger and a micro-USB cable. \nComing back to the smartphone, we’ll start with its highlight – the dual-camera setup at the back. Unlike the Honor 8 ( review ), in the case of the 6X, both the sensors don’t have the same resolution. While the primary snapper is rated at 12-megapixels, the secondary shooter is a 2MP unit. However, you do get similar functionality, i.e. some interesting depth-of-field effects with the focus on the subject and rest of the background being blurred. The device is also able to lock the focus quickly with its phase detection autofocus mechanism. \nWith regards to the design, the Honor 6X is built around a 5.5-inch display, which is the same as its predecessor, the 5X (review). However, it sports an impressive ergonomic feel thanks to dual-curved edges. This allows for easy single-handed use. The metal unibody construction gives the phone a solid feel. \nIn terms of button and port placement, the Honor 6X is bog standard. The volume rocker is placed on the right, followed by a power switch, while the left spine hides an ejectable tray with hybrid dual-SIM slots. Interestingly, the device supports dual SIM cards unlike the previous devices from the brand, where the secondary slot was locked. Additionally, the primary SIM comes with the 4G VoLTE capabilities. The micro-USB socket is placed at the bottom, flanked by a speaker grille and a microphone. The top features a 3.5mm audio port along with a noise-cancelling mic. \nThe dual cameras can be found at the rear protruding slightly from the body. They’re supplemented by an LED flash. Below them, you’ll find the fingerprint scanner with the Honor logo further below. While our unit sported a silver hue, you will also be able to purchase the 6X in gold or grey colours. \nHonor is also pre-pasting a screen guard on top of the display of the 6X to make it slightly resistant to scratches. With a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, the screen is quite crisp. Although, the colours seem to be on the duller side, and brightness levels aren’t that impressive either. \nPowering the show on the Honor 6X is brand’s in-house Kirin 655 chipset. The processor is a combination of two quad-core clusters tuned at 2.1GHz and 1.7GHz respectively. Helping them in the multitasking aspect is the option of either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. The higher-end version also comes with twice the inbuilt storage at 64GB. The hardware is quite capable and should be able to handle heavy apps and games with ease. Of course, we will push the phablet to its limits to test its performance in our review. \nWhile we have talked about the rear cameras of the Honor 6X, it also targets selfie enthusiasts with an 8MP sensor at the front. The viewfinder on the phone is similar to other offerings from the brand – it’s minimalistic yet rich with features and modes. \nSoftware-wise, the Honor 6X isn’t very different from its siblings. The device comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the brand’s EMUI skin on top. You get support for various fingerprint-based gestures, floating dock, and navigation bar, among other options. Unfortunately, you do get quite a few apps preloaded – Facebook , Tripadvisor , UC Browser , and many more. The company has promised that the device will get Nougat update by the second quarter this year. \nFuelling up the 6X is an ample 3,340mAh battery, which combined with Honor’s battery management techniques, should be able to last more than a day. \nThe Honor 6X is staking a serious claim in the mid-range with its primary camera… or should we say cameras? However, it’s not the only smartphone with dual cameras at the back in this segment. There’s Lenovo’s Phab 2 Plus ( first impressions ), but its arch rival would be the recently-launched Coolpad Cool 1 ( first impressions ) which is loaded to the brim in terms of specs. We’ll surely be checking out how the Honor’s latest stack up against the competition, so watch out for our review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T09:03:53.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
