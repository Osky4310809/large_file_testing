Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe family of a woman beaten to death by her British fiance in a Paris hotel today demanded an inquiry after he was secretly released from prison after less than two years. \nKinga Legg, a 36-year-old multimillionaire, was found dead in an £800-a-night room at the five-star Bristol after Ian Griffin, now 47, hit her at least 100 times. \nGriffin was jailed for 20 years by judges in Paris in December 2014 after the court heard how he had “massacred” her in an act of cold-blooded murder. \nBut in a decision that has infuriated Ms Legg’s family, a French judge ordered Griffin’s release at a closed hearing in October, and he is now living in the Alsace region of eastern France.

How can this be? I thought that life meant life – you take a life and you pay for it by forfeiting your own freedom. \n\"We all thought he was in jail and that was where he was staying. How could they let him out?\" British businessman Ian Griffin (C) arrives, with his lawyer Francis Triboulet (R), at the Criminal court of Paris to attend his trial on December 1, 2014 (Photo: Getty) Hotel Bristol in Paris where Kinga Legg died (Photo: Google) \nGriffin has been posting photos on Facebook, including one in which he plays in the snow with Tracy Baker, a former Dragons' Den contestant, and their two-year-old son. \nGriffin, who suffers from a neurological condition, himself said: \"I can’t talk about the conditions of my release or the deal – it was a closed hearing.\" \nAsked how he thought Miss Legg’s family would react to his release, he said: \"I don’t know if they know. \n\"Nothing in the world would make me feel better than to make Kinga’s parents feel better. But I can’t.\" \nDuring the five-day trial in December 2014, Griffin, who once ran a chain of tanning salons and gadget shops, admitted being addicted to alcohol and anti-depressants at the time of the killing in May 2009.

I almost did. I’m incredibly sorry now.\" \nGriffin’s lawyers did not respond to requests to comment.
