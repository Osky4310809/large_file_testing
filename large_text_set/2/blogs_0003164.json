In March at the Geneva auto show, the company, which is now part owned by Nissan , is preparing to lean even more heavily on the market trend away from cars by announcing a brand-new compact crossover that will plop down right in between the two. But to help pique interest in the brand until that happens, Mitsubishi is adding a price-friendly Limited Edition Outlander Sport, rolling it out at the Chicago auto show. \n-The Limited Edition joins the ES, SE, SEL, and GT trim levels, sitting between the ES and SE in the hierarchy. As a step up from the SE, it adds 18-inch alloy wheels, fog lamps, HID headlamps, a rearview camera, an alloy fuel door, and black-painted exterior mirrors. The interior features black fabric with red contrast stitching on the steering wheel, shift knob, and brake lever. The Limited Edition also includes aluminum pedals, a heated steering wheel, and an upgraded audio system that has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capabilities.\n- - Yes, Mitsubishi Has Plans for a New Product (Hint: It’s a Crossover) - Mitsubishi Outlander Plug-In Hybrid Delayed to Summer 2017 - Mitsubishi Outlander Sport: News, Reviews, Specs, Pricing, Photos, and More - -The Limited Edition starts at $22,890 with front-wheel drive or $24,390 with all-wheel drive, and it is only available with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Like the ES, it’s powered by a 148-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It costs $1000 more than the ES and $700 less than the SE, which uses the 168-hp 2.4-liter four-cylinder but has less equipment. Mitsubishi hasn’t said that there’s any specific number it plans to sell—our guess is that they’ll make as many as people want to buy.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:12:18.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
