(CBS) — Police in Florida say a teacher found a 5-year-old student chewing on a used condom on the playground. \nAccording to TC Palm , Fort Pierce police are stepping up patrols at St. Lucie Elementary School following the incident that occurred last Wednesday. \nPolice said kindergarten students were on the playground when a teacher saw the young student chewing on a used condom that was found on the ground. \nThe teacher took the condom away from the boy. The school called the boy’s mother, who took him to the Lawnwood Regional Medical Center & Heart Institute where he was observed and declared fine. \n“It’s pretty clear that someone was likely having sex there or near there, or (it’s) a possible prostitution issue,” Ed Cunningham, public information officer for the Fort Pierce Police Department, told TC Palm. \nCunningham added this appeared to be an “isolated incident.” \nSchool security told TC Palm that similar items have previously been removed from the playground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:00:57.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
