WikiLeaks had earlier pledged, via tweet, that its founder would agree to U.S. extradition if Mr. Obama granted clemency to Manning. Holed up for more than four years at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Assange has refused to meet prosecutors in Sweden, where he’s wanted on a rape allegation, fearing he would be extradited to the U.S. to face espionage charges if he leaves the embassy. But the Justice Department has never announced any indictment of Assange. WikiLeaks lawyer Melinda Taylor said U.S. and British authorities refuse to say whether the U.S. has requested extradition. Though she praised the commutation for Manning, Taylor made no mention of Assange’s earlier promise to agree to extradition. White House officials said neither Assange’s fate nor separate concerns about WikiLeaks’ role in Russian hacking of the U.S. presidential election factored into the decision to commute Manning’s sentence. The officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. Any action that Justice Department officials may take regarding Assange “is something that they would do independent of the White House,” spokesman Josh Earnest told CNN. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
