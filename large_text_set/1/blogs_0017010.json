Joining the MPV on stage is a similarly-modified Subaru WRX STI, although the engraving has been dialled down a little for the boxer-powered sedan. \nKuhl also showcased the various body kit and styling options available for cars such as the Nissan GT-R, Skyline GT-R (R34), Toyota 86 and Prius. As you’d expect, each car gets an outlandish paintjob and plenty of negative camber to ensure maximum visual impact. Also on display was a collection of concave rims that should appeal to “stance and fitment” fans. \nWhile we’re not sure if Kuhl’s work will appeal to everyone, but there’s no denying that the company’s creations feature some pretty intricate handiwork.
