By Urmimala Banerjee | Updated: March 6, 2017 1:27 pm Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna were twinning in black for their Valentine's date \nIt is a season for remakes. We had the new version of Tamma tamma again in Badrinath Ki Dulhania this month and the year began with The humma song being made for Ok Jaanu! Now it is the revamped version of Tu Cheez Badi from Mohra that has been made for Machine. The song is a cult one from the 90s and ranks as one of Raveena Tandon and Akshay Kumar ‘s best ever. Till date, its beats are infectious and can make us sway in a trance. Abbas Mustan have remade the song for Mustafa Burmawalla’s debut film, Machine co-starring Kiara Advani. (Also read: Teaser of Akshay Kumar- Raveena Tandon’s Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast remake is out and we are scared – watch video ) \nBollywood Life got in touch with Raveena Tandon who told us, “Yes, I heard the number and liked it. I feel they have done complete justice to the number. It is peppy and I enjoyed it a lot.” When we told her that people would have difficulty seeing Kiara as the new girl, she said, “That is bound to happen but Kiara is very good. She has a lot of oomph in the number. She danced very well.” The original song is composed by Viju Shah who gave us the classic Saat Samundar. \nNot only Raveena, even Akshay Kumar is pretty kicked about the song. In fact, he launched the track today with the cast in attendance. He had fond memories of the day he had danced on this iconic song, which shaped generations. There is a reason Bollywood is presently obsessing with 90s dance tracks. There was something for everyone back then. The decade didn’t really produce exemplary films, but did give us some of the best tunes we have ever heard in Bollywood. A whole generation has grown up dancing to these, including the young actors of today. Ranveer Singh’s enthusiasm for all things 90s is what we feel for that decade. And Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast is just one of the many thunderous gems it has given us. But the best part is both Akshay and Raveena have liked it. So road ahead for this remix will be pretty smooth. \nHowever, it remains to be seen if it will gain similar popularity as The Humma song and Tamma Tamma again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T10:16:17.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
