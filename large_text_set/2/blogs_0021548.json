Well, it's easier (and cheaper) to train an eagle to do the work of these \"jammers\" that exist to do the same thing. The eagles have been at it since last summer, and it looks like French officials have a simple way of getting the eagles find the drones. \"They have been taught that there is food on the drones, and now when they see one of these devices they intercept. We are training them not just to attack them, but to detect them.\" Aside from being less expensive, it also looks cool as hell. Imagine being out somewhere and being horrified that a drone might shoot you dead, only to see a bald eagle swoop in and disable it. That's beautiful.
