Other states that have recorded one case each, without confirmed deaths, in-clude Edo, Ondo and Rivers.” \nMeanwhile, NCDC in the last quarter of 2016 commenced implementation of its Lassa Fever plan ahead of the current dry season with a view to strengthening nationwide capacity to prevent, detect and respond to the anticipated cases. \nThe deaths in Nasarawa, last week, occurred in Keffi and Lafia Local Government areas, barely one year after two persons died at the State Specialist Hospital in Lafia, including the medical doctor that was treating the patients. \nVanguard gathered that two persons reportedly died at the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital in Lafia, while the other patient, who was earlier referred to Federal Medical Centre in Keffi, also died in the course of treatment. \nThe Chief Medical Director of Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Dr. Ahmed Ashuku, also confirmed two new cases in an interview monitored on the state-owned radio station in Lafia. \nHe said the management of the hospital had engaged medical personnel on a one-day awareness campaign on the need to prevent further transmission of the disease . \nBakare, in the statement, further explained that NCDC is working with affected states to ensure an appropriate response to these cases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T07:47:48.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
