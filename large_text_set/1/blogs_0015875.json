Her house is cut into a hillside to the east of the city and sits at the top of steps brightly painted with hearts. Nearby, there’s a billboard that reads “I like you very much” by a taco stand that announces itself with rainbow parasols. It might be too much for some, but the optimism of California has had me hooked since I was a little girl. \nEvery Saturday morning we walk down the heart-covered steps and cross Sunset Boulevard to the tiny farmers’ market. January brings fat scarlet pomegranates, winter citrus in every shade from lemon chiffon to saffron: mandarins, tangerines, tangelos , Moro blood oranges, kumquats, tiny key limes. There’s pink radicchio, perfect avocados and fluoro-pink watermelon radishes. \nThere are deep bins of dried white peaches, mission figs, nectarines, pluots , yellow inca berries preserved in the sun during the late southern Californian summer. My bag fills up with a rainbow to rival the steps. \nThe walk home leads us past the taco stand, the coffee shops and the lady selling palo santo (which, like dried sage, people burn to cleanse their homes). Mexican food is the heartbeat here. Every type of it can be found within LA – not just tacos but whole menus dedicated to mole, quesadillas, enchiladas, burritos … and also upmarket vegan renditions. It’s almost too good to be true. \nIn the hands of Mexican cooks, the bursting produce of the Sunshine State has made for some of the best meals I can recall. Tacos piled high with avocado, the crisp crumbed outside resisting for a moment before giving way to a grassy green butteriness, a salsa layered with char and chilli, sweet and tart, all atop a perfect hand-size soft corn taco. Mole made with mission figs, spooned on to tortillas, beans gently spiced and refried, all the better for the second cooking. These are the things I cook when I get back home: a riot of colour and unabashed flavour that reminds me of the west coast’s vibrancy, all the more welcome on a January day in London.

They have a totally different texture and flavour to the softer corn and wheat tortillas we are used to in the UK, and are easily available online . Here I break my no-tomatoes-in-winter rule: the charring brings out a sweetness in even the most lacklustre winter specimen. If you’re able to cook this in the summer, when tomatillos are in season, do use them. \nServes 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T14:14:03.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
