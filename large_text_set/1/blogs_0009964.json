In November, he found out he has stage 4 muscle and bone cancer. Since, a lot of Chive Chapters across the nation have come together to create events and auctions to raise money for his hospital bills. Stretch is that Chiver we all want to be and right now he needs our help. 2 \nLast weekend, Chiverhood of Traveling Pants, a Facebook group held a live auction of handmade crafts and other gear to help the cause, ultimately raising $2,100. 3 \nTexas Chivers and Colorado Chivers teamed up and created a Crowdrise page to help his family raise funds during this trying time. The fundraiser page is currently at $5,191 and going strong. Donate to Stretch on his page HERE . 4 \nIt doesn’t stop there. Denver Area Chivers and Chivettes is teaming up with CHIVE TV to help the cause, collecting items in Breckenridge and Denver that can be auctioned to further help Stretch’s piling bills. \nBreckenridge Bar Crawl When: Thursday, January 12th @ 7PM Where: The Quandary, Park Ave. Pub, Ollies, Burk and Riley’s $4 drinks and shots with $2 going to charity \nWhen: Saturday, January 14th @ 5PM Where: Romes, Dive Inn Pub on Pearl, Candlelight, Stoneys $4 drinks and shots with $2 going to charity 5 \nStretch recently posted this on the Denver Area Chivers and Chivettes page: “TUES Jan 10 Good morning everyone! Hope you having a good day so far. Well nothing new to report since it’s still my sore throat. Gag reflexes kicked in and I noticed it’s a lot of flime when I am spitting up. I know that I am thirsty as all get out, but I can’t drink more than 1/4 to 1/2 oz, though a straw, at a time. So it looks pretty ridiculous with me trying to chug water, through a straw…. it’s not working lol. Oh I guess there is a few more things…low blood count yesterday so cancer doctor cancelled radiation treatment and cancelled also for today as well (remember I am staying here until radiation is over with so that means I am not leaving Wednesday or Thursday now). So today, blood transfusion. OH and getting another remote port needle today (every Tuesday anyway, but maybe I didn’t bring it up in a while). Have a great day everyone!!! #KCCO #tacotuesday” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T08:22:52.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
