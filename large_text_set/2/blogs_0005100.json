But every good thing comes with a cost and contact lenses are not an exception. \nWhen you take your contact lenses lightly, you end up making several common mistakes that could be hurting your eyes. \nAccording to a 2015 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost all of the 41 million estimated contact lens wearers in the U.S. may be practicing at least one behavior known to increase their risk of eye infections. \nThe report also pointed out that nearly one-third of contact lens wearers who participated in a national survey reported going to the doctor for red or painful eyes related to wearing contact lenses. \nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology has several safety recommendations for people who wear contact lenses. \nFor all contact lenses users, it is important to have knowledge about the safety measures and also what common mistakes you may be making. This will help you avoid mistakes in the future and protect your vision. \nHere are the common mistakes people make with contact lenses that could damage your eyes. 1. Wearing Contacts for Too Long \nWearing contacts for too long is bad for your vision health. It can lead to permanent scarring and even loss of vision. \nContacts sit on top of your corneas, which do not have blood vessels to bring oxygen to them. It is the tears that do this important job. But tears cannot reach your corneas while you’re wearing contacts, as they act as a shield. By removing your contacts from time to time, you allow oxygen to reach the corneas. \nProlonged wearing of contacts also make your corneas more vulnerable to germs. \nNo matter what type of contacts you have, avoid wearing them too long. This is a simple and effective way to reduce your risk for infection. 2. Sleeping in Your Contacts \nThe habit of sleeping with your contacts in your eyes is another big mistake people often make. \nIt is not at all safe to sleep with your contacts in. Extended wear deprives the corneas of oxygen, which can lead to irritation and discomfort, and even a serious infection. In fact, it is common for users who sleep with their lenses in to wake up with dry eyes and blurry vision . \nPlus, you can even lose a contact lens in the back of your eye because of movement when you sleep. \nA 2009 study published in the Journal of Optometry found that sleeping in contacts was the probable main cause of microbial keratitis. \nA 2015 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 25 percent of eye infections are due to modifiable risk factors. Among these factors, one was occasionally sleeping in contacts. 3. Wearing Your Contacts in Water \nWhether it’s the swimming pool, a hot tub or the shower, exposing your contacts to any kind of water is something you should avoid at any cost. \nWater is a breeding ground for different types of bacteria and other harmful pathogens that can lead to eye infections. In severe cases, it can even lead to vision loss. \nAlso, exposure to water can dehydrate your contacts. \nYou should remove your contact lenses before going in any water. Also, you must never store your contacts in water. Always use sterile saline solution recommended by your doctor. 4. Using Tap Water to Clean Contacts \nUsing tap water to clean your contacts is another big mistake that most users make. \nTap water is not sterile and cleaning your contacts in it can lead to bacteria and other harmful pathogens clinging on the lenses. In fact, tap water is known to contain an amoeba that can cause Acanthamoeba keratitis, a hard-to-treat eye infection. \nAlso, by avoiding rinsing your lenses in tap water, you will prevent your corneas from getting inflamed or scarred, which can impair vision. \nAlways wash your contacts in appropriate solution that is recommended by your eye doctor. It is best to always carry contact-friendly eye drops or a travel-sized contact lens solution with you. 5. Wearing Your Contacts Past the Expiration Date \nEverything comes with an expiration date, including your contact lenses. \nOld, expired lenses become a breeding ground for germs. With use, they also accumulate a buildup of proteins and other residue. Wearing such lenses can be uncomfortable, or worse, it can lead to infection. \nNever risk your eye health to prolong the use of a pair of contacts. By wearing old contact lenses, you are not saving money, instead you are calling for expensive medical bills. 6. Handling Lenses with Unclean Hands \nContact lens wearers often forget to wash their hands before handling the lenses. To avoid getting germs into your eyes, it is imperative that you wash your hands thoroughly before touching your contact lenses, even the case. \nAlways wash your hands with soap and warm water before handling your contact lenses. \nAlso, make sure you dry your hands thoroughly before handling your contact lenses because the microbes that cause eye infections are present in water as well.
