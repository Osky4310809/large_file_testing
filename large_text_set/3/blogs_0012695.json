The stunning actress often experiments with her clothing choices and roles. However, when it comes to makeup we’ve noticed that she favours one particular makeup trend… neutral lips. Need proof? Check out the pictures below. 1. At The Vanity Fair Oscars After Party \nDid someone say siren? Deepika’s nude lip complements her smoked out eyes perfectly, whilst letting those bombshell waves take centerstage. A post shared by Georgie Eisdell (@georgieeisdell) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:11pm PST 2. At New York Fashion Week \nNeutral lipsticks can often wash out your complexion. By pairing her pout with lightly flushed cheeks, Deepika looks fresh and glowing. A post shared by Deepika Padukone Fanpage (@deepika.padukone.fanpage) on Mar 1, 2017 at 5:44am PST 3. At The Promotions For xXx \nEvery beauty lover knows that when you go heavy on the eye, you have to go light on the lips. Keeping with this rule, Deepika offset her smoky, burgundy eye with a soft lip. The result? Beyond beautiful. A post shared by Hung Vanngo (@hungvanngo) on Jan 19, 2017 at 8:03pm PST 4. At The Late Late Show With James Cordon \nClean, minimalistic makeup holds a special place in our hearts. The actress nailed her look with a crisp, winged eye and a plush, nude pout. A post shared by Hung Vanngo (@hungvanngo) on Jan 18, 2017 at 5:48pm PST 5. At The Promotions For xXx \nWe are bookmarking this for our next night out. The shimmery eyes, fluttery lashes and subtle lip all work together to deliver one heck of a look! A post shared by Daniel Bauer Makeup And Hair (@danielbauermakeupandhair) on Jan 13, 2017 at 7:13am PST \nFrom the above pictures, it’s evident that a neutral lip is both wearable and versatile. It’s no wonder that Deepika sticks to it! 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:16:05.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
