Hitting rock bottom has helped it learn some hard truths and the early results have been almost entirely positive. \nExpectations have been dampened, for example, while the hullabaloo surrounding the team is more subdued. Osorio can talk openly about fans not being able to demand Mexico wins a World Cup; he can also both praise the quality of his players and warn that his team will only be able to join the world's elite when it has more players featuring in top European leagues. \nTo openly suggest such things previously would have been almost an affront to Mexico's vision of itself as a major player on the world scene. As such, the Chile defeat was like a bucket of ice-cold water over delusions of grandeur. \nMexico couldn't replace all of the squad, which froze on that day in Santa Clara, Calif.; there simply isn't enough player depth. It meant that any reboot had to come from soul-searching within the same core group and that fresh start is taking some very steady strides forward. \nThe latest incremental growth in Osorio's Mexico project was there for all to see in Friday's 2-0 World Cup qualifying win against Costa Rica at Estadio Azteca. The result, which sees El Tri move to the top of the \"Hexagonal\" standings , built on the historic and pivotal victory at the United States last November. \nMexico latest win highlighted maturity; Osorio's men were controlled and never looked in any real danger, despite facing very good opposition. And while the main headline was, rightly, Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez netting the first goal to level Jared Borgetti's all-time record of 46, the most important conclusion is that this squad is increasingly taking on board what its manager is asking. \n\"Every game the idea of our play is being executed better (by the players),\" said Osorio after the game. \"It was very important for us because there were a number of notable absences through injuries and suspension. It is even more important having won with almost absolute control and domination of various periods of the match.\" A seventh-minute goal by Javier Hernandez set Mexico on the way to victory vs. Costa Rica. \nWith hindsight, it is easy to brush all that off and suggest the hosts should always win in the Azteca against other CONCACAF nations, but let's not forget that the pressure was on. In the Hexagonal ahead of the 2014 World Cup, Mexico won only once in five games at home. \nAs a result, newspaper column inches ahead of Friday's game questioned whether the national team could stand the pressure at home and over 5,000 Costa Rica fans traveled north with the firm belief the Ticos could get a positive result. \nMexico answered empathically and there were positive individual performances from Jonathan dos Santos, Carlos Salcedo, Nestor Araujo and Carlos Vela, among others. \n\"An intelligent game,\" was how Miguel Layun described the display. \"I think things went as we wanted them to. That speaks of a high level of concentration from us.\" \nSpanish mental training coach Imanol Ibarrondo has again been present in Mexico City with the team and appears to be turning into an important figure. It has been noticeable that the mental approach to the game is stressed repeatedly by players. \nThe decision to prepare for Friday's game in Cuernavaca -- 90 minutes outside the nation's capital -- was purportedly to ease the pains of playing at altitude for Mexico's Europe-based players, but Osorio admitted that the lack of distractions in the secluded resort hotel was another important factor. \n\"You can breathe tranquilly; it's a very peaceful place, with the possibility of doing group activities with Imanol to strengthen the mental side. In the physiological part it was spot on,\" said Osorio. \nIt is difficult to believe that bringing in Ibarrondo, as well as allowing the team to prepare for games outside Mexico's state-of-the-art training complex, would have been so readily permitted without last year's humiliation vs. Chile. \nThat humbling will remain a dark yet important reminder that feet need to be kept on the ground, no matter how easily qualification for Russia 2018 may prove to be. In time, it may also be considered a blessing of sorts. \nTom Marshall covers Liga MX and the Mexican national team for ESPN FC.
