We shot this less than a week ago. \n— Andy Hines (@andyhinestv) February 2, 2017 \nIn addition to today’s video teaser, Sean Don hit fans with another dose of good news. The Motor City rapper will launch four separate pop-up shops to celebrate the release of his fourth studio album. \nPop-up shop locations include Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto. \n“I’m too excited to be Dropping new merchandise this weekend for y’all exclusively at the I Decided pop-up shop. Detroit, New York, LA & Toronto. 4 locations each one starts Friday and ends Sunday,” Big Sean wrote in the caption to a photo of the flyer for the pop-up shops.
