Image credit: Science & Society Picture Library | Getty Images --- Shares February 15, 2017 \nIf you’re nostalgic for a simpler, notification-free mobile phone era, have we got news for you. \nAt the 2017 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona later this month, HMD Global Oy, the Finnish manufacturer that holds the rights to the Nokia brand, reportedly will unveil four phones -- including a revamp of the beloved Nokia 3310. \nNokia originally launched the phone in 2000 and discontinued the model in 2005. During that time, it sold 126 million units and was the top-selling phone in the world. The first iPhone would arrive on the scene two years later, forever transforming the mobile market. \nRelated: BlackBerry's Smartphone Market Share Has Reached 0 Percent \nThe 3310 was known for having a super long battery life and sturdy structural design -- and the popular “Snake” game.
