Roman Catholics all over the world trooped to churches yesterday for the rites that remind people of their mortality. EDD GUMBAN \nMANILA, Philippines - Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle yesterday appealed to Filipinos for a “change of heart” which, he said, could be the nation’s biggest contribution to the world. \nIn his homily for the Ash Wednesday morning mass at the chapel of the Arzobispado de Manila in Intramuros, Tagle feelings such as envy, anger, boastfulness and revenge could destroy a community. \nHe asked the faithful to have a change of heart and return to God. \nAsh Wednesday marks the start of the 40-day Lenten season. During this period, the Lord calls on his people to return to Him by seeking forgiveness for their sins. Tagle recalled that in Pope Francis’ Lenten message, there are two things that should be done in order to achieve a change of heart. \nThe first is to discover the Word of God. A baby gets her forehead marked with ashes in a church in Quezon City yesterday. MICHAEL VARCAS   \n“Often times, we would give more importance on what other people say, when what they say does not come from God. We react and reply to these words that do not come from God… But when God speaks, is there a reply? Is anyone interested?” \nThe second is that in order to return to God, one should see his fellowmen as a gift. The Manila archbishop also advocated for people to show their humility and not brag or show off the goodness that they have done for other people. \nHe appealed to the people to give food to the hungry. \n“For as long as the heart of every person would not change in favor of God, for his fellowman, for justice, truth, concern and peace, we would never achieve change,” he said. \nIn life, a person encounters people who would be burdens and cause problems to them, but Tagle said: “We should treat these people as blessings. We should love them, take care of them and help them.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T06:42:23.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
