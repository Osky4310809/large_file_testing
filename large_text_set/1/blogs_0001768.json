Aaron Finch and George Bailey have been dropped from the side, while Usman Khawaja makes a return. Lynn, who has played five T20Is is yet to make his ODI debut. The 22-year-old right-arm fast bowler Stanlake has just played just two First-Class matches and four List A games for Queensland, has made a good impression in the ongoing Big Bash League (BBL). He has picked up 6 wickets in four matches for Adelaide Strikers at an economy rate of under 7. The first ODI between Australia and Pakistan begins from January 13 at Brisbane. \n“This is an extremely important series for us as, following it in a ODI context, we have the Chappell-Hadlee Series in New Zealand and then, in mid-year, the ICC Champions Trophy, a tournament which we won in 2006 and 2009,” said interim national selector Trevor Hohns, according to cricket.com.au . “We believe this squad is an exciting combination that covers all bases for us over the course of the five matches against Pakistan. Both George Bailey and Aaron Finch have been prominent players in the ODI squad over the past few years but both of them have missed out on places in this squad,” he added. \nFull Cricket Scorecard: Pakistan vs Australia 1st ODI at Brisbane \nFinch has scored just 215 runs in his last 10 ODIs, while Bailey has scored 288 runs at 36 in his last 10 appearances with the bat. However, Bailey has just scored 43 in his last five knocks for Australia. Hohns says that he wants to give a few younger players a chance and see how they go in the series \n“George has scored one fifty in his past 10 ODIs and, while his form has not been disastrous, it has not been to his usual standard so we have decided to look at younger players in the middle order in this instance. Aaron, across the past four series in the Caribbean, Sri Lanka, South Africa and the Chappell-Hadlee Series, has scored four fifties in his last 18 innings. I have spoken to both players and they understand our perspective as selectors,” Hohns said. \n“Usman Khawaja has been in excellent touch throughout this Test summer, is able to bat anywhere in the top order and deserves another chance to demonstrate his ODI credentials,” he further added. \nAustralia certainly have the momentum having whitewashed Pakistan 3-0 in the recently-concluded Test series.
