Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTheresa May has been slammed for branding livesaving charity the British Red Cross \"irresponsible\" over the chaos in the NHS. \nThe relief charity warned of a \"humanitarian crisis\" last week as it emerged A&Es were forced to shut their doors more than 100 times in December. \nWhen Tory MPs led a backlash against the claim, Theresa May avoided direct criticism - saying only she didn't \"accept\" the description. \nBut today she went much further as she came under attack from Jeremy Corbyn . \nShe said at Prime Minister's Questions: \"He refers to the British Red Cross's term of a humanitarian crisis. \n\"I have to say to him, I think we’ve all seen humanitarian crises around the world. \n\"And to use that description of an NHS which last year saw 2.5million more people treated in A&E than 6 years ago was irresponsible and overblown.\" \nMr Corbyn shot back: \"The Prime Minister might not like what the Red Cross said. \n\"But on the same day the British Medical Association said conditions in hospitals across the country are reaching a dangerous level. \n\"The Royal College of Nursing has said NHS conditions are the worst ever. \n\"The Royal College of Physicians has told the Prime Minister the NHS is underfunded, underdoctored and overstretched. \n\"If she won’t listen to the Red Cross, who will she listen to?\" \nOne MP could be heard heckling to Mr Corbyn: \"Not you!\" \nMr Corbyn devoted all six of his questions to the NHS crisis at his first weekly duel of 2017 with the Prime Minister. (Photo: AFP) \nHe accused Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt of trying to “fiddle the figures” by saying non-urgent cases shouldn’t count in the 4-hour limit for waiting times in A&E. \nHe suggested the Prime Minister's call for a 'shared society' really meant \"more people sharing hospital corridors on trolleys\". \nAnd he raised the case of a 22-month-old boy who was treated on two plastic chairs pushed together by a blanket in an NHS hospital. \nOne of the nurses, he said, told the boy's mother \"it's always like this.\" \nHe asked: \"Do the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary think this is an acceptable way of treating a 22-month old child needing help?\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T20:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T15:37:49.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
