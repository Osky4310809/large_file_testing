That’s a cry for help primarily for our pupils but also for all local families and our staff.” \nOne pupil at the Bounds Green primary school, nine-year-old Lola Chattam, has been taken to hospital five times for asthma attacks since she was five. Her family feared she would die after an especially severe one two years ago. “It gets quite overwhelming sometimes and quite hard to breathe,” Lola explained. “Cry for help”: Lola Chattam, left, with her mother Katie Dawson and brother Joe. Lola has been hospitalised five times with asthma. (Chris Gorman) \n“It feels very tight and quite scary. At school I have an inhaler and at home I use my inhaler in the morning and at night time.” \nHer film director mother Katie Dawson — who lives on busy Warwick Road close to the 450-pupil school — said: “The asthma has definitely got worse and worse over the last four years just because of the level of traffic. \n“Walking home from school you are literally walking through a cloud of black smoke — and that’s right outside our front door.” \nMother-of-two Ms Dawson, 42, went on: “Lola was exercising the other day and had to stop as she was breathless. It has got to a point where we are considering moving away from the area.” \nShe said her two-year-old son Joe had started “rasping” at night and may have “baby asthma”. Head teacher: Effie Demetriou (Chris Gorman) \nBowes Primary in Enfield borough is in one of at least 20 London locations where particulate pollution soared to a “very high” level — black or 10/10 — in this mid-winter’s toxicity episode from January 17 to 24, according to scientists at King’s College London. \nLocal families claimed that changes to the road system, which had made Warwick Road a “rat-run”, had worsened pollution. Kate Bentley, 46, a teacher with eight-year-old twin girls at Bowes, said: “It’s very worrying. Our children are going into that playground every day on the North Circular. You do worry about the long-term effects.” \nWarwick Road resident Lucinda Perez, 46, a supply teacher who has a daughter at Bowes, said: “I think the pollution levels are frightening. I get infuriated by the whole situation.” \nMayor Mr Khan said it was “shameful” that more than 400 London schools were “choking” in areas breaching legal pollution limits. \nHe added: “It is unacceptable that Bowes Primary, like many of our schools, suffered harmfully high toxicity levels earlier this week.” \nHe said that City Hall’s plans to extend the proposed Ultra Low Emission Zone to include the North and South Circulars would target toxic air in locations such as Bowes Primary. \nHe is also introducing a £10-a-day “T-charge” for the most polluting vehicles to drive into central London from later this year. But the Mayor appealed to millions of Londoners to pile pressure on the Government to do more to tackle filthy air, including bringing in a national scrappage scheme for diesel vehicles and a new Clean Air Act. \nOther areas hit by “very high” pollution in recent days include: \nNorth Kensington, Brixton Road, Lambeth, Bloomsbury, Blackwall in Tower Hamlets, Marylebone Road in Westminster, Swiss Cottage, Vauxhall close to the MI6 headquarters, Bushy Park near Hampton Court, close to IKEA in Brent, Havering, Merton, Stanmore, four in Greenwich, including Plumstead High Street, Shepherd’s Bush and Horn Lane in Ealing. \nOutdoor activity for pupils at Sir John Cass’s Primary School, Aldgate, was restricted this week due to a “very high” air pollution alert and the cold. \nThere were also more than 20 “high” readings in London during this toxic air episode, including a 9/10 at John Keble Primary School in Brent. The bout of filthy air, which is now believed to have lifted, led to Mr Khan triggering his first ever “very high” pollution alert, with warnings put out at thousands of bus stops, all Tube stations and on busy roads. \nThe Government insists it is “firmly committed to improving the UK’s air quality”. A spokesman said: “That’s why we have committed more than £2 billion since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emissions vehicles, support greener transport schemes and set out how we will improve air quality through a new programme of Clean Air Zones.” \nIf pollution rises to “very high”, then people should “reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as cough or sore throat”. \nAdults and children who have lung and heart problems and also pen- sioners are being advised to take greater precautions.
