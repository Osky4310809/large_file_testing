Another 75,000 people born in those countries live in Canada but are not full Canadian citizens.\nWhat‚Äôs unclear is whether Canadian citizens who were born in one of those seven countries but do not have dual citizenship will also be banned from entering the US. If that is the case, the number of affected Canadian citizens would rise to 170,000.\nThose numbers all come from the 2011 census and would all-but-certainly be higher today. The 2016 census data will start to be released next month.\nOne person who may be included in the ban is Ahmed Hussen, who was appointed Canada‚Äôs minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship earlier this month. Hussen came to Canada as a Somali refugee in 1993. He eventually became a lawyer and human rights activist before being elected as a member of Parliament in 2015.\nThe Prime Minister‚Äôs Office told BuzzFeed News it is ‚Äúnot concerned about the ability of the Minister to travel.‚Äù However, spokesperson Cameron Ahmad did not say whether Hussen would only be able to travel to the US using a diplomatic passport while on government business.\nAs news of Trump‚Äôs ban spread Saturday, Hussen tweeted from a citizenship ceremony he was attending.\n15 yrs ago I took the oath of citizenship. What an incredible feeling to welcome 21 new üá®üá¶ at my 1st citizenship c‚Ä¶ https://t.co/eeMOr41apE\n‚Äî Ahmed Hussen (@AhmedDHussen) ID: 10417492 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not directly addressed the immigration ban, but also tweeted a message that appeared to be in response to Trump‚Äôs executive action.\nTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada\n‚Äî Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) ID: 10417417 Meanwhile, Canadian airlines have stopped allowing passport holders from the seven listed countries to board flights to to the US, even if they have green cards or visas.\nCanada and the US share the longest undefended border in the world. Tens of thousands of trucks and hundreds of thousands of people cross the border every day . Passports were not even needed to drive across the border until after the 9/11 attacks.\nThe question now is how Canada will respond to a ban that could significantly impact trade and the mobility of Canadian citizens. It also runs contrary to the worldview Trudeau has championed. Whereas Trump has banned all refugees from entering the US for 120 days, one of Trudeau‚Äôs first acts in office was drastically increasing the number of Syrian refugees coming to Canada.\nCanada has resettled nearly 40,000 Syrian refugees since late 2015, as well as more than 20,000 from Iraq over the past decade.\nTransport Canada spokesman Delphine Denis said the department is in touch with US officials ‚Äúto get more information on the impacts.‚Äù\nThe Canadian Immigration, Foreign Affairs, and Public Safety departments did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": ["http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/welcome/milestones.asp", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/825438460265762816", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/the-canada-u-s-border-by-the-numbers-1.999207", "https://t.co/eeMOr41apE", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/825412704387072001", "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/28/passport-holders-of-7-muslim-majority-countries-cant-board-air-canada-flights-to-us.html", "http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=0&PID=105411&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=95&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF"], "published": "2017-01-29T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T01:53:22.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
