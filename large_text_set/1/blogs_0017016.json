Image caption Similarly, the Daily Express reports that Mrs May will walk out of Brexit talks if EU chiefs try to punish the UK for leaving. In what it calls a historic speech, the Express says the prime minister laid out Britain's path to becoming truly independent again. Image caption \"Give us a fair deal or you'll be crushed,\" is how the Times puts it. The paper says Mrs May warned Brussels that any attempt to punish the UK for leaving the EU would be \"an act of calamitous self-harm\". Image caption The Guardian says Mrs May warned European leaders that the UK is prepared to crash out of the EU if she cannot negotiate a reasonable exit deal. The paper says the tough rhetoric prompted key figures in Brussels to say the UK was on track for a \"hard Brexit\". Image caption A prominent cartoon on the front of the Daily Mail depicts Mrs May - in the distinctive green tartan suit she wore for the speech - trampling on the EU flag on white cliffs. \"In an iron-willed speech, Theresa May delivered an emphatic ultimatum to EU leaders,\" says the Mail. Image caption The Sun goes with a Biblical theme, referring to what it calls Mrs May's 12 Commandments and running the headline \"Brexodus\" on a stone tablet. The paper says the prime minister threatened to go it alone if the UK does not get a good Brexit deal as she laid out her 12-point plan. Image caption The Daily Mirror fills its front page with Mrs May striding confidently to her speech at Lancaster House in London. The Mirror says the prime minister said she would end talks rather than accept bad terms for the UK - but trade unions warned that quitting the single market was a gamble that risked millions of jobs. Image caption According to te i, Brexit means... the UK will quit the single market and customs union, Parliament will vote on the final deal, Britain will leave without a trade deal if the EU cannot provide good terms, the UK will be free from European courts and there will be immigration controls on all EU citizens. Image caption The Financial Times says Mrs May set out a new role for a \"global Britain\" outside Europe's single market in a speech outlining plans for the UK's \"epochal\" EU exit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:25:08.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
