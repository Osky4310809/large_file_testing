The most recent star to join the anti-awards group lead by the likes of Aamir Khan and Kangana Ranaut, is Amaal Mallik. \nThe popular musician of Bollywood took to Facebook today to lash out at the award shows and their unfairness. Amaal wrote, \"It is so funny & surprising that you go out of your way and give a star kid all the new comer awards for the best debut, for a performance no one even saw...Whereas a #DiljitDosanjh who deserved that award for #UdtaPunjab is nowhere !!#Sarbjit had #RandeepHooda almost kill himself to bones, and play that character, and you nominate only #AishwaryaRaiBachchan hahahahaha!\" \nAmaal goes on to pen more thoughts as he talks about forgotten albums of Kahaani and Neerja. Amaal's point is that many deserving music albums have not even been nominated. Read Amaal's long note and let us know if you agree with him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:20:58.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
