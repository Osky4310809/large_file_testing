The line announced a two-year brand partnership with \"O, The Oprah Magazine,\" which will bring Oprah's Book Club onboard more than 300 sailings in 2017 and 2018, along with fitness classes like meditation and tai chi, enrichment courses and demonstrations about healthy eating, and the travel-friendly fashion of Oprah's creative director Adam Glassman. Oprah will also make an appearance onboard, sailing on her first trip to Alaska aboard Holland America's Eurodam for two days during the July 15 departure from Seattle. \nFour other sailings, dubbed \"Adventure of Your Life\" cruises, will feature special guests \"in the Oprah wheelhouse,\" including members of the SuperSoul 100, a group of \"thought leaders and visionaries,\" according to a news release. The theme cruises will sail November 29, 2017; March 3, 2018; August 11, 2018; and October 28, 2018. \nThe partnership comes during Oprah Magazine's Year of Adventure, marking a year of exploration and enrichment. \"Our values line up in an exciting way,\" Orland Ashford, president of Holland America Line, said at the announcement, which was held at Hearst Headquarters in New York City. Ashford was joined by Gayle King, Oprah's longtime friend and editor at large of \"Oprah Magazine\"; Lucy Kalin, editor-in-chief of \"Oprah Magazine\"; and Jayne Jamison, senior vice president, publisher and chief revenue officer of the magazine. \nKalin said representatives from each of the two brands had lunch to talk over the idea of a partnership, and \"it was the corporate equivalent of falling in love.\" She spoke on their shared focus of personal growth, encouraging joy and richer connections. \n\"Oprah seldom partners with anyone,\" King said. \"It's not that she doesn't play well with others; she's just very particular about her brand and its perception.\" King also said the enthusiasm about the partnership was \"instant.\" \nReaders of Oprah's magazine will see a Holland America spread in the April issue, and a March contest will offer three winners a trip onboard Oprah's sailing. \nAshford also discussed the line's new TV advertisement, which he hopes demonstrates the line's commitment to \"embracing cultures and transforming lives, creating connections; through exploring new places, we improve and benefit.\" \n\"This is the most ambitious and fabulous thing we've attempted, and we can't wait to work it into our Year of Adventure,\" Kalin said. \nFor more information on Oprah's sailing, the Adventure of Your Life cruises and the fleetwide onboard activities, visit Holland America's microsite .
