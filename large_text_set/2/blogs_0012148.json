Avery Bradley was sidelined yet again with an Achilles injury, while rookie sensation Joel Embiid’s knee injury kept him out of the 76ers’ lineup. \nTHOMAS GETS JERSEY The Celtics will be well represented at the NBA All-Star game in New Orleans this weekend, as Brad Stevens will coach the Eastern Conference and Thomas will come off the bench. Prior to tip-off, IT received his All-Star jersey at mid-court. Prior to tonight's game @Isaiah_Thomas was given his All-Star Game jersey. #Celtics pic.twitter.com/JMlefMl4ai \n— CSN New England (@CSNNE) February 16, 2017 \nC’s REBOUND FROM ROUGH START The Celtics came out rather flat. The 76ers got out to a quick 6-0 lead after Boston turned the ball over three times in the first two minutes of action. The Celtics recovered, though, as the score was locked at 29-29 after one quarter. The C’s relied on their primary scorers in the opening frame. Thomas posted 11 points in the first 12 minutes, nine of which coming from beyond the arc, while Crowder contributed 10 points. Robert Covington was the main source of offense for Philadelphia to start the game, scoring 11 points in the first quarter. The Celtics were lucky to have the score tied after the first stanza, though, as they surrendered seven turnovers in the opening quarter. \nTIED AT THE BREAK The back-and-forth action in the first half translated into a tie score at the break, as the teams were locked at 61-61 after two quarters. The Celtics received quality halves from their role players, namely Olynyk and Smart. Olynyk contributed 13 points, as well as four rebounds and an assist. Smart arguably had the most well-rounded stat line of any Celtics player at the break, with nine points, four assists and three rebounds. Despite the absence of Embiid, Philadelphia still held the rebounding advantage over Boston after one half, 23-19. Thomas and Covington were tied for the halftime scoring lead with 18 points apiece. \nBOSTON CAN’T PULL AWAY Boston came out strong in the second half, going on a 12-2 run to take a 73-63 lead just 3:30 into the third quarter. The Celtics would extend their lead to as large as 14 points, but the 76ers chipped away to cut the deficit to 87-79 heading into the fourth quarter. The C’s posted a respectable 47.5 shooting percentage through three quarters, but turnovers continued to plague the green. Going into the final quarter, Boston gave the ball away an alarming 17 times. A lackluster free-throw shooting performance prevented the Celtics from pulling away as well. Through three quarters, Boston only converted on 18 of 25 attempts from the charity strip. \nCELTICS SHUT THE DOOR The 76ers rallied to open the fourth quarter, taking a 94-93 lead with eight minutes remaining in the contest. The teams would go back-and-forth for much of the quarter, but Smart hit a clutch 3-pointer with just under four minutes remaining to extend the Celtics’ lead to five. . @Al_Horford with some great defense and @Smart_MS3 knocks down a three at the other end! #Celtics pic.twitter.com/enV1dKGyL4 \n— CSN New England (@CSNNE) February 16, 2017 \nBoston wouldn’t look back from there, holding Philadelphia to just seven points in the final five minutes of the game. \nPLAY OF THE GAME", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:02:34.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
