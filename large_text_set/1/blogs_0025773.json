Essentially, he was annoyed that nobody cared about Live By Night as much as they cared about the iconic comic book character that has enjoyed a consistent level of popularity for several decades, with Affleck even going so far as to say that the constant Batman -related questions were “a pain in the ass.” \nNow, it looks like Affleck has finally caved to that pressure. According to Variety , he will be stepping down as the director of The Batman , but he will still star as the eponymous caped crusader—reprising his roles from Batman V Superman and the upcoming Justice League .

I am still in this, and we are making it, but we are currently looking for a director. I remain extremely committed to this project, and look forward to bringing this to life for fans around the world. \nNow, DC and Warner Bros. will begin searching for a replacement. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:00:13.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
