If taken to Nate / Nora 's corpse in Vault 111, he will say \"Damn. Hey, look, if you wanna get out of here...\" If Finn is killed by the Sole Survivor, Hancock will be rather calm and applaud the player character. He recognizes Nick Valentine from Diamond City . On the upper floor of the Memory Den the player character can break into Irma 's (novice) terminal and read an entry about Hancock that states: \"...well, let's just say if you thought he was handsome and dangerous now, you should've seen him before he turned ghoul.\" According to Deacon , Hancock turns a blind eye to the Railroad's activities in Goodneighbor . This can also be noted by the existence of a \" Join the Railroad \" holotape on his coffee table. If taken to Vault 81 , some of the residents there will insult him, to which he will reply with a witty remark. When the Sole Survivor travels without clothing across location borders, Hancock will make comments implying he appreciates the view or call them Emperor (in reference to the Emperor's New Clothes .) This will also increase his reputation with the Survivor. This can be exploited with quick saves and restores to quickly max out affinity. Hancock likes any actions done in the nude. Besides fast traveling, crafting and working on settlements are easy ways to gain affinity. Hancock can be killed by the player character, upon which he will say \"One... last... trip...\" This is most likely caused by the random companion death bug where essential flags get removed. If one has him around after completing In Sheep's Clothing , he will express regret for being wrongly angry with his brother. Hancock's chems of choice are apparently Mentats because they make him feel \"intellectual\", as stated in one of his off hand comments. [1] Hancock wears an American flag as a sash. If one kills Fahrenheit during The Big Dig he will describe as having a \"devil take me\" attitude. This could be a reference to the short story \"The Devil and Tom Walker\", in which a Massachusetts man makes a pact with the Devil for fortune. Tom Walker's last words are \"the Devil take me if I have ever made but a farthing!\". According to a relationship marker in the game files, Fahrenheit is Hancock's daughter. This is never alluded to in-game and is most likely a scrapped idea, given the small age gap. And it is unlikely as Fahrenheit is described as being his 'main squeeze' instead. It is possible that settlers in the settlements have a short conversation where they call him Mayor and talk about they owing him money, indicating that they once lived in Goodneighbor . Piper refers to him as her \"second least favorite mayor\". Notable quotes Edit \" Of the people, for the people. \" \" Plenty of folks wanna make life hard for people just tryin' to survive. I'm not willing to stand for that kinda shit. \" \" What kind of settlement requires a test for entry? \" – Referring to Covenant . \" Whoa, the Downs. Hope we're not going anywhere for a while. \" – Referring to Easy City Downs. \" That kinda bull is the reason I became mayor in the first place. \" – Referring to The Big Dig \" Damn. Hey, look, if you wanna get outta here... \" – If taken to Nate / Nora 's corpse in Vault 111. \" If someone needs help, we help 'em. If someone needs hurting, we hurt 'em. It's not hard. \" \" Like it? I think it gives me a sexy, king of the zombies kinda look. Big hit with the ladies. \" \" Looks like you can use a little pick me up. \" – Said when initiating dialogue with him as a companion (and him giving the player character a random chem) \" Whoa ho ho, I like you already! Walk into a new place, make a show of dominance. Nice. \" – referring to the Sole Survivor killing Finn \" Listen close. It's the last thing you're ever gonna hear. \" – When Sinjin tells the player character to stop speaking as The Silver Shroud \" Christ, it's bright in here. Clearly they didn't consider some folks might be nursing hangovers. \" – Possible comment when entering Vault 81 . \nIf completing The Big Dig with Bobbi No-Nose. \" How you doin' killer? Arms tired from all that digging? You know, my strongroom is surprisingly empty now... \" \" Now if it was just the money, I'd rough you up, break a few bones, and then we'd be square once you paid me back. But you killed Fahrenheit. That means blood for blood. \" When traveling naked: \" Hey Emperor, love the outfit. \" \" Let them stare. \"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:48:25.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
