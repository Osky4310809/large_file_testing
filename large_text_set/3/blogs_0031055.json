That, unfortunately, makes it completely vulnerable to an action backed up by no information and no concern for the outcome . \nEPA administrator Scott Pruitt says President Trump will sign an executive order Tuesday to roll back the Obama Clean Power Plant initiative, which aimed to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. \nFollowing the hottest year ever (that’s a NASA link, so get it while you can) it might seem reasonable to at least review the information behind the Clean Power initiative before drawing a line through the whole thing. But then, reasonable is not exactly a quality Trump is known for. \nAnd watch as Pruitt plays into the Trump Digs Coal fantasy: \nPruitt said he believes the order “absolutely” will bring back lost coal and manufacturing jobs “across the country.” He also promised the executive order would result in lower electricity rates for Americans. But the demand for coal has been waning, given the abundance of natural gas in recent years. \nThe facts? Killing the Clean Power Plan will not generate the slightest bit more demand for power. It won’t cause one coal power plant to be built, planned, or expanded. It won’t do any of the things that Pruitt claims. \nBut it will generate more profits for companies, and more pollution for consumers. Which is really what the Trump regime is all about.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:06:27.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
