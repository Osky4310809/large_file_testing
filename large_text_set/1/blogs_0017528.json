No matter who wins the AFC championship and how they win it, the Falcons looked so unstoppable in shutting down Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay’s eight-game winning streak that it’s hard to imagine anyone but Matt Ryan holding the Lombardi Trophy two weeks from tonight to bring Atlanta just its second sports championship ever. \nBut not so fast my friends. Winning championship games in a blowout has not been a sign of good things to come in the Super Bowl. In the past 20 years, four NFC championships have been decided by 20 or more points. None of those victorious teams went on to win the Super Bowl. \nLast year, Carolina rolled over Arizona 49-15 and entered Super Bowl 50 as five-point favorites over Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos. The game was a snooze. Back in 2006, the Bears beat the Saints by 25 and lost two weeks later in Peyton Manning’s first Super Bowl win (with the Colts). A year before that, Seattle won the NFC championship over Carolina, 34-14, a result that didn’t help them against the Steelers in Super Bowl XL. And then, in 2000, the Giants scored the biggest rout in NFC championship game history – shutting out the hard-luck Vikings 41-0. New York would then lose to Ray Lewis and the Ravens. (USA TODAY Sports Images) Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports \nOverall, NFC teams are 5-7 in the Super Bowl after a 20+ win in the conference title game. AFC squads winning by the same margin are 2-3. The Patriots wrecked the Colts 45-7 two years ago in the Deflategate game and then, of course, went on to win the Super Bowl. That’s the only time in the past quarter-century an AFC championship has been decided by 20 or more points. The only other AFC team to win after a 20+ championship game was the 1978 Steelers, who beat a Cowboys team that won their championship game by 28 points. \nThe biggest championship game blowout was when Buffalo beat the Raiders 51-3 to get to Super Bowl XXV. They lost to the Giants, wide right. \n\nAtlanta also became the fourth team in NFL history to score 44 points or more in a championship game (in either conference). Only one of those won the Super Bowl – those ’14 Pats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T02:12:07.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
