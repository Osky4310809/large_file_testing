Many of them believe that Christianity is under attack in the United States and that our nation’s moral fiber is weakening by the day. Additionally, many believe that a Hillary Clinton presidency would result in a liberal Supreme Court that could take away religious liberties. Perhaps these things are true. Like many people, we who are writing believe Clinton has proved herself untrustworthy with political power. We do not trust her judgment in choosing Supreme Court justices, and we understand why so many Christians are afraid. The future is uncertain,\" Liberty University students wrote in October 2016. \"Trump is the antithesis of our values; there is no reason to revisit his vices here. Most non-Christians recognize Trump as amoral and self-centered. If we ignore this fact and buy in to his promise of strength, what will it tell the world about how seriously we Christians esteem our values?\" \nGiven Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, he may receive a warmer welcome than previously expected. Trump will deliver his address on Saturday, May 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:07:07.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
