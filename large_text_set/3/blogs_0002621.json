I was told you guys raised a million and a half dollars already for Special Olympics, which is so great, let’s have a round of applause. \n“I want to thank the bagpipe players that are here to play, should I pass in the water,” Shepard continued. “They are going to play very lovely to honor me and I thank them for that. And this is a terrible idea! I thank you so much for inviting me.” Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band at the 2017 Chicago Polar Plunge (Credit: Shannon Blum) \nPromoting the upcoming action comedy “CHiPS,” in which he stars in, Shepard wore his cop uniform from the film to take the plunge.
