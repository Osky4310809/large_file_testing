The company’s budget Moto G series devices have helped the brand to create a strong foothold in the country in its second inning. Now Jan Huckfeldt, the chief marketing officer of Motorola, has revealed that India is the third largest market in value for the company. \nHuckfeldt said that the Indian market is among the fastest growing alongside the Brazilian market for Motorola. Lenovo is positioning Moto as the premium brand for the vendor. “Moto and Lenovo address two different consumer segments with the specs conscious customers going for Lenovo and customers looking for a trustable brand buying Moto,” Huckfeldt added further. \nHuckfeldt claims that Lenovo and Moto brands together control over 25 percent of the market in terms of online sales in India. The brand inaugurated a manufacturing plant in Chennai 18 months ago, which has the capacity to produce six million devices a year, around 60 percent of its sales in the country. \nThe Moto executive also revealed that the company crossed one billion in mobile sales in India some time ago. However, he didn’t disclose when exactly the vendor surpassed this milestone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T07:46:18.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
