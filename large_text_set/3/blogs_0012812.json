(Photo: khloekardashian/Instagram) \n\"They only endorse what aligns with their lifestyle - they turn a lot down,\" adds Heller. \nHe adds that Kim only promotes brands she has a stake in, including her Kimoji range and LuMee light-up phone covers. And she namechecks Kayne's Yeezy range for adidas, because you'd want to support your spouse, really. \nLast year, Kourtney's ex Scott Disick got rumbled by one of his sponsored posts when he simply cut and pasted an email to an Instagram post for Bootea, which read, \"Here you go, at 4pm est, write the below. Caption: Keeping up with the summer workout routine with my morning@booteauk protein shake!\" \nWhoops.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T17:04:17.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
