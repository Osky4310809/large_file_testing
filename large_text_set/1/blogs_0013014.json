'Not to be missed' \nA selection of the paintings has been on view in Rozelle House but the sheer size of the works will fill all the spaces at The Maclaurin Gallery and much of Rozelle House as well. \nSouth Ayrshire Council said it was \"a mammoth undertaking and a truly historic event not to be missed\". \nLachlan Goudie, the artist's son son, says: \"My dad was obsessed with Tam o' Shanter and he spent decades of his life creating these images. \n\"Since childhood he'd known about Robert Burns and it had been his lifelong ambition to create this complete cycle of images.\" \nMr Goudie, who is a painter himself, says: \"He was painting Tam o' Shanter way beyond the point where my mother was shouting 'enough'. \n\"He was a professional artist and needed to make a living and my mother looked at these terrifying huge canvasses and thought 'we are never going to sell these paintings.\" \nHe says his father was \"theatrical, noisy, hilarious and sometimes terrifying\" and that is exactly what comes through in the paintings. \nMr Goudie says viewing the cycle turns the black and white text of the poem into the \"most vivid fireworks that you can imagine\". \nThe exhibition runs from 15 January to 12 March.
