The answer is Instagram, if you’re former 7th Heaven sisters Jessica Biel, Beverly Mitchell, and Mackenzie Rosman, who reunited this week almost 10 years after their beloved series’ finale.\nMitchell, who is now 36 years old , married — Biel and Rosman served as bridesmaids in her 2008 wedding — and a mom to two children, posted a pic with her former TV sisters for “Woman Crush Wednesday,” also gushing about the reunion on her blog Growing Up Hollywood .\nI have been truly blessed with these two beautiful women who really are like sisters they [sic] me! They challenge me, they inspire me, and they make me a better person!” Mitchell wrote. “Though we don’t see each other as often as we would like, it is always like we have never been apart and I couldn’t be more thankful!!! I love these two beyond words and have to say that after a few hours together today my heart is full!” #Wcw #sisters #family #love gushing on my blog!

Along with Barry Watson and the group’s TV mom Catherine Hicks, the Camden girls were thrilled to support the new-ish mom’s latest venture, which is ostensibly for kids but also serves alcohol.\nSo much fun supporting our girl @JessicaBiel on the launch of her amazing new restaurant @aufudge! Love these people like family! #nothinglikefamily #7thheavenforever #aufudge #familyfriendly #getfudgedup \nA photo posted by Beverley Mitchell (@beverleymitchell) on Feb 26, 2016 at 4:11pm PST \nMitchell threw her daughter Kenzie a birthday party at the venue last April with Biel by her side, so we’re officially calling it — these three ladies are even closer in real life than the frequently squabbling Camden sisters were on the show, and we’re so happy for them that they’ve been able to make their sisterhood last for two freaking decades.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T17:46:32.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
