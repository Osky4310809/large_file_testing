Can the Reds bounce back after three consecutive home defeats against Antonio Conte’s inspired Blues? Liverpool v Chelsea (Tuesday 31st January, 8pm) Will Costa continue Liverpool's defeat? He's set to bring in a lot of Fantasy Football points this week (Photo: Getty) \nJurgen Klopp has had a terrible start to the year with Liverpool. They've now been beaten in four of their eight games in 2017 and their only victory this year has been against Plymouth. The defence looks fragile and Chelsea will look to take full advantage. \nDiego Costa’s fall out with the Chelsea management was well documented but the Spanish International has put that saga behind him and returned to action with the opening goal against Hull last week. \nCosta has collected 130 Fantasy Points this season with a record of 15 goals and 5 assists from 20 starts. As Chelsea’s established striker Costa should prove good value for Fantasy managers at £9.4m, unless he gets injured. Arsenal v Watford (Tuesday 31st January, 7.45pm) Sanchez is the best player for Arsenal by far... put him in your team and watch the points roll in (Photo: David Price) \nAlexis Sanchez is Arsenal’s best player, having collected 139 Fantasy points this season - in Fantasy Football terms only Theo Walcott with his 86 points even comes close. \nAlexis has started 21 games, scored 15 goals and assisted 8 this season. But the return of Danny Welbeck and the resurgence of Olivier Giroud may have a negative effect on his ability to score Fantasy points for the rest of the season. \nArsene Wenger experimented with Sanchez as the main striker earlier in the season when the others were unavailable, but he may look to play Alexis on the wing to accommodate one of the in-form strikers. Sanchez is currently the highest valued player in Fantasy Football at £9.5m, whilst he is equally capable playing wide it may limit his opportunities in front of goal. Manchester United v Hull City (Wednesday 1st February, 8pm) Ibrahimovic has made a big impact off the pitch as well as on - all eye's will be on him this week (Photo: Getty Images) \nAs well as making a big impact outside of the crucial 90 minutes this year, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is undeniably king of the scoresheets. \nThe Swedish 35-year-old is fast becoming this generation's Eric Cantona, inspiring his teammates on and off the pitch with his experience and wisdom. As well as this, he has collected more Fantasy points than any other United player, with 127 points after starting 21 games, scoring 14 goals and providing 5 assists. \nIf you don’t currently have any of these players in your Fantasy team, you're missing out on massive points and we recommend get them on your side, stat! \nIt’s still not too late to start playing Fantasy Football, you can play to win fantastic prizes every week and month. \nJoin our free fantasy football game now.
