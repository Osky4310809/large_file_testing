Most of us function at less than our full potential. When we practice meditative asanas and breath control on a regular basis, there is a palpable increase in our well-being. In the last two years of my journey with Yoga, there have been gaps… times when, for a host for reasons, I have not been able to practice for days on end. The first few times didn’t make a dent, because the effects of Yoga are often long-lasting. If you have a strong foundation in the practice, you can go months without it, before your body begins to lose the flexibility and strength that it had gained, and your mind begins to get foggy. Alternatively, if there the breaks are too frequent, and longer than the patches of daily practice, it begins to take a toll. In September of last year, I got hit by Chikungunya. High fever, followed by joint pain,followed by upset stomach left me unable to get back on the mat for a month. When into the fifth week, I still couldn’t hold the plank for ten seconds without my wrist hurting, a fellow Yoga practitioner and teacher advised that I should wake my body up slowly. The routine suggested by him helped incredibly, not just in regaining some of my strength, but also reducing the joint pain. But ever since that forced hiatus, I have been struggling to re-establish a routine. My practice is now sporadic, and often, the sessions are shorter than I would like for them to be. The first time I realised how the lack had been affecting me was when I had two weeks of erratic mood. I became snappy, and impatient, and my mood level dipped significantly. It was then, after much contemplation, that I realised that Yoga had been keeping me sane. Quite literally. According to Patanjali, Yoga is about calming the monkey mind. The first sutra that he puts forth “c hitta vritti nirodhan ,” is about learning to stay equanimous through the ups and downs of life. Without consciously working towards that goal, I had somehow achieved it. When I stopped giving myself the daily dose of calm and composure, my emotions went haywire. Yoga had done wonders for my body. I lost six extra kilos that I had been carrying around for years, toned up, and became stronger. Opening jars and lugging around heavy bags of groceries stopped being a problem. But, in the two years, I became accustomed to it, and forgot that I had to work for it. In the last few months, my declining practice has been a reality check, a gentle reminder that if I want a healthy body, I need to work for it. The fact is, that Yoga changed my life in every way. From my mood to how I look at myself. From my joint health to diet. From my daily routine to how I navigate relationships. And most importantly, how much I could pack in a day. It is said that the more you do, the more you can do. I never believed this until I welcomed Yoga in my life. The practice increased my energy level, and decreased the number of hours I needed to sleep every night. It cut my tolerance for any sort of bullshit, and anything that’s a waste of time. The focus that I had to practice on the mat taught me to do everything mindfully, so that I would gain more from any situation in a lesser period of time. The ability to be in the present moment is what creates more time and space to do more. I see all of this slowly fading, and it is truly heartbreaking. What I can hope for is that the discipline that I learnt to cultivate on the mat, can help me through this rut, and bring me back on the mat.
