She’s much better off wearing a swimsuit. \nAdvertisement \n\nVelvet’s revealing default outfit caused a stir when it debuted last year, with some fans disappointed that the first solo female main protagonist in the Tales series was wearing little more than scraps. I like it, but then I’m a big fan of strings. Strings are great. \n\nVelvet’s manner of dress prior to her tragic demon transformation is much more subdued. She’s just a villager, doing villager things like hunting boars and cooking quiche.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nUnfortunately, transforming into a pulsating hate being and spending three years in prison kind of ruined that look for her. \n\nIn the midst of her daring prison escape, Velvet pauses to put together an outfit that’s slightly less ragged. \n\nI’m not sure how much better this is. At least she’s got a jacket, and there’s a bit more color. She’s angry, red is angry. I suppose it fits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T18:18:24.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
