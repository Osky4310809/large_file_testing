Shut your f**king mouth.” Kim takes a swipe at Nicola's Page 3 career (Photo: bbuk/Twitter) Nicola tells Kim she's unimpressed (Photo: bbuk/Twitter) \nThen Coleen Nolan finds herself involved, as Kim brands her two-faced. But Coleen replies: “You are vile. I totally agree.” \nThere’s certainly no love lost between the two women and it doesn’t look likely that they’ll be calling a truce before Friday night’s live finale. \nHow Clean Is Your House star Kim, 74, lost her cool with model Nicola, 35, last night as well, unleasheding a torrent of fury against her when the Celebrity Big Brother Awards went very wrong. \nKim raged: “You really are a nasty piece of work and I don’t know why the hell you are. You want to pick on Kim? Don’t you bother. I had hoped we had a little something here but you’re a nasty b***h of a girl, you’re a saddo.
