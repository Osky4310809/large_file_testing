As a result of the tournament turning into a straight knockout at the quarter-final stage, an extra substitute will be allowed during the additional 30 minutes to add “extra intrigue and interest” as FA chief executive Martin Glenn put it. Whilst protecting player welfare as cramp sets in, it will also be interesting to see how managers use it – whether they attack relentlessly before throwing on an extra defender or add another forward from the offset to push for a winner. A combination of this and no replays will hopefully encourage more exciting and attacking football to revitalise the FA Cup. Ronaldo was replaced by Morata as a fourth substitute was used for the first time competitively last year ( Getty ) Mourinho’s Chelsea return (part II) \nJose Mourinho gets another shot at redemption when he returns to Stamford Bridge for the second time this season on Monday night. His first trip back there since being sacked last season was disastrous as United were picked apart in a 4-0 humbling as the Portuguese and his successor, Antonio Conte, clashed on the touchline. He will be Zlatan Ibrahimovic-less but United are a far better team now than they were back in October and there is no way Mourinho would allow such a capitulation to happen again. Knocking Chelsea out will be a tall order and it will be interesting to see whether Mourinho decides to play a full-strength team with the return leg at home to Rostov only three days later. Mourinho and Conte clashed when they faced off at Stamford Bridge in October ( Getty ) Battle at the bottom \nHull host fellow relegation candidates Swansea, who have had a resurgence under new manager Paul Clement. The Swans are up to 16 th and are five points clear of the relegation zone and Hull need to win on Saturday to prevent them from pulling away in the battle against the drop. Hull have improved under Marco Silva but good results for the likes of Swansea and Leicester mean it has counted for nothing so far. It is a must-win game for the Tigers if they are to have any hope of avoiding relegation while Swansea could jump up as high as 14 th and put themselves in a very strong position with 10 games remaining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T15:07:43.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
