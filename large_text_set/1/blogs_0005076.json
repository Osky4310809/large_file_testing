Josh Newkirk 9:13 AM / Originally published on The Michigan Insider Five-star 2017 OG Tedarrell Slaton names leader, and is playing defense in his future? \nVideo interview by Eugene Hankerson \nStory by Josh Newkirk Plantation (Fla.) American Heritage Tedarrell Slaton is rated by Scout as a five-star offensive. However, if he has it his way, he will be lining up on the defensive side of the ball in college. “When I started off in football, I started off at nose guard,\" Slaton said after his U.S. Army All-American Bowl practice on Tuesday. \"Actually really liked it. Unfortunately I stopped playing football in sixth grade. So when I came to American Heritage offense was the open position. So I just took it.” Florida and Kentucky have taken note of his desire to be a D-lineman and are recruiting him as such.. In fact, when asked, he even admitted that Florida was his outright leader for his collegiate services. Besides the aforementioned tow, Baylor and Miami (Fla.) are also notable teams recruiting him the hardest at the moment. He even intends on taking an official visit to Florida on Jan. 20. He says he also plans to take official visits to Kentucky, Baylor, and Ole Miss, though, no official dates have been set yet. That being said, where does that leave the Michigan Wolverines ? “I talk to Michigan sometimes,\" he replied. \"They like me. They want me to play offense. I have no problem playing offense. But if that’s what they need, that’s what I am going to give them.” Slaton says there are no more plans to visit U-M again, and was quick to point out he’s been on four visits to Michigan’s campus already and they've all been positive experiences. “Well I actually like them from the relationships with the coaches, that’s what I am really big on,” he said. “(I) still have a good relationship (with U-M). I still talk to them time to time.” Slaton's U-M visits have also given him a chance to connect with U-M coach Jim Harbaugh. “It was actually a good experience,” he said. “I didn’t know he was that type of guy, he’s actually really funny. So he’s really cool. He’s kind of laid back , but (also) enthusiastic. I like coaches like that.” Already with a strong relationship with offensive line coach Tim Drevno, Slaton says bonding with his future O-line coach will play a major role in his recruitment. “It’s very important,” he said. “When you have a good relationship the coach opens up more. He actually tells you everything that he knows. I am a good listener. So I just want to know everything that they can give me.” Share on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T06:24:32.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
