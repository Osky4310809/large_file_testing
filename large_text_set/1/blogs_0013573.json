The heat won’t ease much tonight. Picture: John Grainger Sleepless and sweaty: No respite in sight tonight as heatwave settles in Debbie Schipp, news.com.au January 17, 2017 5:16pm \nTONIGHT’S forecast? Sweaty with a side of sleeplessness. \nSydneysiders can look forward to a hot, sticky night: the heatwave with eastern Australia in it’s grip has no plans to sleep tonight. \nHot on the heels of scorching temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s across NSW today, temperatures aren’t expected to ease off to comfortable sleeping weather. \nThink a repeat of last Friday night’s record-breaking hottest January night : A minimum of 27C forecast in Sydney overnight before the mercury heads north again on Wednesday. \nToday, temperatures shot up quickly, leaving the city melting by midday, and it only got hotter. \nPenrith hit 43.6C at 4pm; Richmond 43.5C, Camden 42.7C and Badgerys Creek Creek 42.2C. \nAnd so much for it being ‘comfortably cooler’ near the coast, Sydney Airport hit 37C at 3pm. \nThe CBD wasn’t expected to go above 31C today — but it was 34C at 3.30pm. \nAnd a Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) spokesman said the humidity is only making things worse: it’s high, and will remain so, making the night seem even more sweaty and uncomfortable. \nSurvive the night, and the forecast 36C for the city tomorrow, and if you can hold until midday, the BoM predicts there’s hope of a southerly change sweeping in, reaching the west a couple of hours later. \nElsewhere in the state, Canberra hit 38.6C, Nowra hit 41.6C, Griffith has a top of 43.6C, Maitland topped at 40C, Mudgee topped at 38.9C, Casino in the Northern Rivers hit 35.3C and Walgett had a maximum of 41.1C. media_camera Might as well stay there for the night: A man cools off At Lake Parramatta today. Picture:AAP/Dan Himbrechts \nVICTORIA \nMELBOURNE was waiting on a forecast cool change after temperatures hit 26.7C by 9am, and kept right on rising past the forecast 35C top (achieved about 11am). \nMelbourne Airport hit 38.3C at 4pm. \nOut of the city, Essendon Airport topped at 38.9C, Avalon hit 39.5C and Swan Hill topped the state with a maximum of 44C. \nBack in the city, temperatures at Melbourne Park maxed out at 36.9C at 4pm, with Australian Open organisers keeping a wary eye on the weather. \nBall kids were given extra breaks, ice packs will be available to players and referees can stop play if the heat is thought to be a serious threat. \nBut Australian Open events and facilities director Tom Larner said it was unlikely the ‘extreme heat policy’, last initiated at Melbourne Park in 2014 when temperatures soared above 40C, would need to be enforced. media_camera Rafael Nadal of Spain prepares to serve as sweat drips off his nose in his first round match against Florian Mayer of Germany at the Australian Open.

Other hot spots include Roxby Downs with 43.5C and Whyalla with 42.8C. In Adelaide the temperature had climbed to 40C by early afternoon. The extreme conditions forced organisers of the Tour Down Under cycling race to cut short the first stage by 26 kilometres to 118kms. \nThe weather also prompted SA Power Networks to cancel some planned maintenance to ensure all residents had access to electricity for air conditioning and other cooling. \nTotal fire bans are in force across nine SA districts, but the BoM says conditions are expected to ease over the next 24 hours as winds shift to the southwest. Adelaide is forecast to have a top of 28C on Wednesday. \nQUEENSLAND \nTHE Sunshine State is set to get searingly hot: the BoM predicts an ‘extreme heatwave’ around Gympie, with temperatures expected to reach at least 38C each day until Sunday, and not drop much below 30C at night. \nThe southeast quarter of the state is set to swelter through warm nights and even warmer days as a heatwave sweeps through the tail end of the week. \nBoM forecaster Michael Knepp said the mercury would rise from Wednesday through to Saturday with maximum temperatures ranging from the low to high 30s from coastal to inland Queensland. \nHowever, there will be no respite from the heat overnight as minimum temperatures will remain in the mid 20s. \n“It’s not record breaking in terms of extremes, it’s a prolonged period of hot weather,” Mr Knepp said. \nMr Knepp said the bureau was not expecting any storms but there was an increased chance on Friday and Saturday, which would be particularly “yuck”. “We would like that to happen but that’s not always the case, just because we get the humidity doesn’t mean we get the storms,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T08:26:23.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
