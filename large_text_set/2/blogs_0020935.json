This type of training where you incorporate fun, happiness, sun rises, sunbathing - this works for me. David Haye \nHe told Sky Sports News HQ : \"I have heard him say I would go to the opening of an envelope. I think he's just jealous because he doesn't get invites to anything, because he's just a real dull character. A moaning, negative, dark clouds around him guy. \n\"If I was fighting Anthony Joshua, I would be doing exactly the same training, because I believe this works for me. The training of old doesn't work for me any more. My body breaks down. The former world champion is expected to attend the Brit Awards \n\"This type of training where you incorporate fun, happiness, sun rises, sunbathing - this works for me and you'll see come fight night, the difference between a happy athlete and an angry athlete.\" \nHaye marked his comeback with two routine stoppage victories last year and believes he is physically and mentally stronger after a break from the sport. Haye blasted aside Mark de Mori within the first round on his return to boxing in January last year \n\"People look at that gap as a negative, I look at it as a positive,\" said Haye. \"I've had time to reflect on my training, reflect on how I live my life. What makes me happy, what makes me sad. What training sessions went well and why they went well. \n\"I've had a lot of time to reflect on my career and that's culminated in me being standing right here, knowing exactly what needs to be done in training camp to get the best out of myself. Tony Bellew reveals hatred of training ahead of grudge fight with David Haye \n\"Although I haven't fought in competitive fights for five years, I'm fresh, I haven't taken any big punches, my body is in good condition and I'm ready to go. I feel like I've got a whole career ahead of me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:51:13.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
