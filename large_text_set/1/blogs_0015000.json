Free gift cards? \nOver the past weekend, several Naked Security readers in the UK alerted us to a similar sort of WhatsApp scam, this time stealing the brands of at least two major UK supermarket chains. \nUnsurprisingly, especially with the 6/6 vision that hindsight so often brings, the “free gift cards” in this latest scam campaign are as elusive as the “free Wi-Fi” in the earlier scam. \nWe received numerous screenshots of the offending messages, targeting two different brands and referencing three different domain names in their clickable links. \nFortunately, the hosting provider that services these three domains, all of which have their contact data shielded behind a domain privacy service based in The Bahamas, has pulled the plug on them. \nThe links in the scams we’ve seen now terminate at a holding page that keeps potential victims away from the scammers: \nAccording to reports from people we talked to who were tricked into going through with the scam while the links were alive, the results were very much like those we observed in the “free Wi-Fi” scam above. \nOne person was given a survey to complete; another was asked to install an app they wouldn’t otherwise have considered. The difference from email spam \nThe big difference between a typical WhatsApp scam and an email scam is that the messages you receive come from someone you know, because they’ve been tricked into forwarding the scam. \nEmail spam campaigns usually rely heavily on malware-infected computers known as bots (short for “robots”) or zombies that can be remotely commanded to start sending unwanted messages secretly in the background. \nBut WhatsApp scammers don’t need to mess around with malware to subvert your phone into sending unwanted messages, because they can use the goodwill and trust that typically exists between friends to convince people to spread their scams willingly. \nIn fact, we contacted some of the readers who reported these recent shopping voucher scams and asked them if they’d mind asking their upstream friends a pair of tricky and potentially friendship-challenging questions: “What made you think it was legitimate? Why did you forward it to me?” \nOne friend said: \nIt seemed unlikely but worth it. OK, I haven’t received anything yet, so perhaps it is a scam, but, hey, my mate got his voucher. \nOf course, this upstream friend didn’t actually get a voucher. \nHe was tricked into sending a boilerplate message that stated he’d got a voucher, and thereby understandably convinced his downstream friend it had actually happened. \nAnother sender admitted they’d forwarded the scam first, as requested, then ended up in a survey, and finally – we are glad to report – got cold feet halfway through and bailed out, though not after inflicting the scam on ten of their friends. What to do? \nWe’re going to repeat what we said last time. \nWhen it comes to freebies, special deals and other innocent-sounding web offers, especially when they are apparently recommended by your friends, it’s easy to fall into the “no harm in taking a look” trap. \nAfter all, this scam doesn’t actually try to trigger any exploits to implant malware on your phone, or trick you into installing malware, so it’s easy to think of it as mostly harmless. \nBut it’s a scam nevertheless, and even if all you do is to take a look, you’re taking part in something with potentially harmful side-effects on the community around you, from bombarding your friends with unwanted messages to helping crooks to earn affiliate revenues fraudulently. \nSimply put, keep your distance: don’t try, don’t buy, don’t reply .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T17:36:32.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
