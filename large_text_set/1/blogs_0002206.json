It is very unusual to find major proof errors.\"\nRegarding the quarter in question, Byers added: \"This unique 1970-S Proof Quarter from the United States was over struck on a 1941 Quarter from Canada. This mint error was originally discovered in [a] group of San Francisco Proof Errors that was auctioned by the State of California. ... This is one of the most fascinating and intriguing proof mint errors ever discovered.\"\n\n\nU.S. coin collectors come in two basic varieties, according to Collectors Weekly. There are those who collect rare coins that are in great condition. At the other extreme are the error collectors, who focus on those coins with physical mistakes or damages.\nOn the quarter in question, the \"1941\" can barely be seen above the word \"dollar\" on the back of the coin, according to Woman's World magazine, which added that it's \"unlikely that one of these high-value quarters will be in your junk drawer.\"\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T08:05:33.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
