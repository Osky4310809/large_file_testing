It finds that large majorities reject the basic idea that undocumented immigrants who have been in this country for a long time — and have not committed serious crimes — should nonetheless be subject to removal. It’s the latest sign of a larger trend that goes like this: Little by little, the narrative that President Trump and his top adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, have been telling about what is happening in this country is getting translated into concrete policy specifics. And Americans are recoiling from the results. x \nThis isn't amusing.

President Trump’s budget outline is what would happen if one reversed Churchill’s principle entirely, and then built a government around it... “He wants to value what’s visible and doesn’t care about what’s invisible, even if it actually does something,” Dan Drezner, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, says of Trump. “This is thinking that I’m going to add an addition to my house, and I’m going to do so by not paying my home insurance.” x \nTo understand why the Russians wanted Trump: ignore the liberal Glenn Becks and look at the way he's treating Germany and the U.K. — Jamie Kirchick (@jkirchick) March 17, 2017 \nBBC interviews Louise Mensch for 6 minutes here. Keep in mind much of what she says is in nutter territory. She gets facts right and connects the dots in a crazy manner. Be aware of the crazy. For example, check out the argument about “peddling wild conspiracy theories” such as Putin murdering Andrew Breitbart (which she states she believes); be careful how you use her theories and arguments. \nAndrew Neil interviewed former Conservative MP Louise Mensch about claims of Russian involvement in the US presidential election. \nMore from BuzzFeed : \nRussia Critic Sparks Feud At The New York Times \nAn opinion piece [ link ] by controversial writer and former UK member of Parliament Louise Mensch mentions her FISA warrant story, which Times reporters have knocked down. “The NYT newsroom disagrees with her baseless claims,” a Times reporter said. \nSee also this piece from Lloyd Grove /Daily Beast: \nRussia expert Tom Nichols, a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, publicly scolded Mensch last month for her claim that Putin had Andrew Breitbart whacked. \n“This is crazy talk,” Nichols tweeted. “And undermines the important point that Russia has done real things for which it must be held accountable.” \n“She’s batshit crazy, OK?” Nance told The Daily Beast. “She is a fruit loop of the highest order.” \nMensch fired back: “I am unfazed by little people snapping at my heels.” x \nLouise Mensch is Carrie Mathison on a bad acid trip and if you disagree with her, you're a Kremlin plant.
