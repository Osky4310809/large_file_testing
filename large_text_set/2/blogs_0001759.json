It was built by his grandfather in 1929, the year Grace Kelly was born. \nAsked for when it will open to the public, Albert told People: “To give ourselves enough room, I’m saying a year but it could be less than that. To give you an answer, 2018, possibly earlier.” \nPeople also reports that the Monaco-based Princess Grace Irish Library is in discussions with Villanova University on establish the library's first overseas extension at the house.
