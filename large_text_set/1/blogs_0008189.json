But I thank them today,\" he said. \n\"I just want to compliment many people in the room, I have great respect for the news and freedom of the press and all that but there were some news organisations that were so professional, incredibly professional, you’ve just gone up a notch as to what I think of you.\" \nHis press secretary, Sean Spicer, introduced him by saying the report was \"frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible\". \nMr Trump added the report was \"openly hostile\" and provided \"flat-out false information\". \nHis last press conference was on 27 July in Florida, and focused largely on questions about his alleged relationships to Russian business people. \n“So, it's been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference,” he said at the time. ”And you, as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports, should ask yourselves why. And I'll tell you why. Because despite the nice platitudes, she's been a mess.” \nThe conference at Trump Tower on Wednesday makes it more than 160 days since he last spoke himself.
