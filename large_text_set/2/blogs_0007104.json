I believe the Democratic party can save democracy. I’m concerned that we won’t take the chance. Here’s what concerns me the most: The DNC Chair race has been framed as a final showdown of the primary . Who will win the soul of the party? Moderate Liberal Cronyism or Populist Millennial Bernie Bros? Only two of the NINE candidates get coverage and they are treated as caricatures in a proxy war. This coverage gets clicks (and ad revenue) but doesn’t help us identify which of the candidates will successfully negotiate a ceasefire and build up the party’s failing infrastructure with effective, detailed operational plans and visions that will expand our coalition, build trust in the party’s brand, and win back seats at every level. Voting members of the DNC must resist this narrative. Democracy is at stake. Yet, they seem to be buying it. I went to the Chair forum in Detroit. Amidst the team spirit posters and cheers,* I talked to candidates and their supporters who were hearing variations on the theme: “You’re my top pick but you can’t win; this is a two person race,” punctuated with choruses of, “we can’t split the Progressive vote.” This bothers me for many reasons. First, there are nine people running. Who determined that seven of them aren’t even worth consideration? If the answer wasn’t “the voting members of the DNC and the people they represent,” then we must ignore that determination. Secondly, the vote is not first-past-the post. While you may decide to use some sort of strategy in later rounds, your first ballot cannot “split” or “spoil” the vote. If another candidate gets over 50% of the vote, it doesn’t matter which of the other 8 you voted for. That fear of splitting or spoiling is misplaced in this voting system (particularly on the first ballot). Third, it isn’t a legislative primary. The ideal candidate isn’t suggesting legislation and they absolutely must not control who runs or what platforms are established — that kind of favoritism threatens a split in the party. Those candidates who are ideologically strong are the ones we should be pushing into Congressional leadership roles, where their platforms can turn into actual laws. The ideal Chair candidate is one who has (and is capable of implementing) a detailed, visionary, sustainable plan that lifts the people’s voices, the people’s platforms, and the people’s candidates so that when Democrats win up and down the ballot, across all states and territories, the people are the real winners. We all agree there are a lot of lessons to learn from the 2016 primary. Let’s be careful about those lessons. Sanders supporters (myself included) must resist the temptation to claim that the chair simply supported the wrong candidate. Sure, it is nice to have things tilted in your favor, but the root of the problem is the structure of power at the DNC, not what the person in power favors. The power structure is set up so that the chair could (and, in my opinion, did )make decisions about who to support and then failed to set up reconciliation processes quickly or skillfully. The takeaway from 2016 is that our next DNC Chair must avoid favoritism by expressing an ultimate preference for democracy itself , supporting the people and the candidate(s) they democratically choose. The chair must buildand provide the resources that strengthen an expansive coalition of diverse people, rather than strengthening the Chair’s singular voice (or these who speak “in unity” with them). This is what the next chair must do. But an extraordinary Chair would also change the culture of the DNC so that the power structures live in the hands of the people, not the Chair, even after they leave. I have watched all of the forums and the debate. I have read the platforms of each of the candidates. I have talked at length with some of the candidates and, when that was not possible, to supporters of each of the candidates. While I believe several are qualified, only one stands out. That candidate has the clearest, most detailed platform with the strongest potential to make positive, long lasting changes to the DNC. That candidate is Sally Boynton Brown. Some candidates have used the words “organize” and “grassroots” over and over again, but never tell us the nuts and bolts of how or even what they mean by “grassroots.” Read her blueprint and compare it to the others’ plans. Sally gives us the clearest explanation of how she plans to accomplish her goals . Sally’s plan is also the most sustainable. Relying on one individual’s charisma or “commitment” to get the job done could be effective for a time, but sets us back to square one when the Chair position changes hands. Instead, she will set up structures to support the workers of the DNC and our state/territory partners in building enthusiasm, solving problems, addressing grievances, connecting with activists that share our values, getting out the vote, etc. With Sally’s plan, we will still be in motion when her term is up. With the power in the workers’ hands, we will continue to build the bench in times of transition. As the Executive Director of Idaho’s Democratic Party, Sally knows how to organize in red and rural environments AND in progressive urban centers. We desperately need this kind of experience and know-how in the current environment. Turning out the vote in the blue city centers is a failed experiment. (Candidates who say “My district’s turnout is so high, we keep the whole state blue” worry me — that is a failed plan in largely rural, deep red states.) We have to be making inroads, building trust in our brand among non-voters, third party voters, people considering whether they will leave the party, and those who have voted Republican against their own self-interest. As the President of the Executive Directors, she understands the challenges facing state parties. But she doesn’t have vague platitudes about “needing to partner” and “working closely” — she has a detailed, systematic approach to building those state party partnerships and supporting party leadership so they can build long term success. I could go on and on…but you don’t need to take my word for it. Instead, I encourage you to read her platform and then to take a leap and reach out to her with your ideas for democracy. Decide for yourself if she is someone who listens to the people, will expand our coalition, will strengthen our partnership with state parties, and will bring the vision, experience, and know how necessary to transform the DNC into an organization that the people are proud of voting for, up and down the ballot. *One particularly jarring cheer was a re-mixed protest chant: “Show Me What Democracy Looks like!” followed by, “(name of candidate) is what Democracy Looks Like!” I hope the candidate was unaware of the chant. Democracy absolutely does not look like one person. Any leader who thinks otherwise is dangerous. We must to change the hierarchical culture of the DNC and bring our values and operations into alignment. The best case scenario is that the candidate’s cheerleaders, who were brought in for the purpose of chanting, simply did not receive mentoring or instructions about messaging. It is concerning to have such a difference between the energy of the Resistance and the energy of the campaign. I would not want that out-of-touch feeling to be the brand of the Democratic Party.
