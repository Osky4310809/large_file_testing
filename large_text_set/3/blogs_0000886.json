Paul traveled tirelessly through the ancient world, taking the message of salvation to the Gentiles. Paul towers as one of the all-time giants of Christianity. Apostle Paul's Accomplishments \nWhen Saul of Tarsus, who was later renamed Paul, saw the resurrected Jesus Christ on the Damascus Road, Saul converted to Christianity . He made three long missionary journeys throughout the Roman Empire , planting churches, preaching the gospel, and giving strength and encouragement to early Christians . \nOf the 27 books in the New Testament , Paul is credited as the author of 13 of them. While he was proud of his Jewish heritage, Paul saw that the gospel was for the Gentiles as well. Paul was martyred for his faith in Christ by the Romans, about 64 or 65 A.D. Apostle Paul's Strengths \nPaul had a brilliant mind, a commanding knowledge of philosophy and religion, and could debate with the most educated scholars of his day. At the same time, his clear, understandable explanation of the gospel made his letters to early churches the foundation of Christian theology. Tradition portrays Paul as a physically small man, but he endured enormous physical hardships on his missionary journeys. His perseverance in the face of danger and persecution has inspired countless missionaries since. The Apostle Paul's Weaknesses \nBefore his conversion , Paul approved of the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:58), and was a merciless persecutor of the early church. Life Lessons \nGod can change anyone. God gave Paul the strength, wisdom, and endurance to carry out the mission Jesus entrusted Paul with. One of Paul's most famous statements is: \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,\" ( Philippians 4:13, NKJV ), reminding us that our power to live the Christian life comes from God, not ourselves. \nPaul also recounted a \"thorn in his flesh\" that kept him from becoming conceited over the priceless privilege God had entrusted to him. In saying, \"For when I am weak, then I am strong,\" (2 Corinthians 12:2, NIV ), Paul was sharing one of the greatest secrets of staying faithful : absolute dependence on God. \nMuch of the Protestant Reformation was based on Paul's teaching that people are saved by grace , not works: \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith-and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-\" (Ephesians 2:8, NIV ) This truth frees us to stop striving to be good enough and to instead rejoice in our salvation, gained by the loving sacrifice of Jesus Christ . Hometown \nTarsus, in Cilicia, in present-day southern Turkey. Reference to the Apostle Paul in the Bible \nActs 9-28; Romans , 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians , Ephesians , Philippians, Colossians , 1 Thessalonians , 1 Timothy , 2 Timothy, Titus , Philemon , 2 Peter 3:15. Occupation \nPharisee , tent maker, Christian evangelist, missionary, Scripture writer.
