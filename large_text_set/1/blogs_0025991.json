For Santa Cruz - the challenger - it was expected but deemed \"a little light\" by Sky Sports boxing expert Carl Froch. \nFrampton is convinced last July's victory over Leo Santa Cruz ensures he holds the \"psychological edge\" in this huge rematch in Las Vegas. Carl Frampton v Leo Santa Cruz - Tale of the Tape \nThe 29-year-old makes the first defence of the title he won when inflicting the first defeat of Santa Cruz's career, via a majority decision, and has been recognised since as among the world's finest fighters. \n\"Going into this fight, I have the psychological edge,\" Frampton said in Vegas. \"This is my second fight at featherweight, so I'm getting more used to the weight. I feel more comfortable overall this time. \n\"It means absolutely nothing to me that I am fighting him here. I am going to beat him again but this time more convincingly. \n\"Taking off four pounds to make super-bantamweight was affecting my performance. I prefer being up here at featherweight. I really feel like a different man.
