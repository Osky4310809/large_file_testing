Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLeft hurt by the lies pal Karen Matthews told her about the kidnap of her own daughter Shannon , Julie Bushby could be forgiven for wanting nothing to do with her. \nBut the 46-year-old has spoken out in defence of the convict , insisting she could not have carried out the snatch plot alone. \nJulie said Matthews does not have the intelligence to have thought up such a cynical plan, that many believed was hatched to cash in on reward money. \nAnd the shop worker believes others involved in the false kidnap have created a shroud of silence around the case to protect themselves from prosecution. \nJulie said: “I think there are at least three other people who know far more than they let on. This is a horrible conspiracy of silence and it’s time for those people to speak out and tell the truth.

I’m not saying at all what she did was right, or that she was totally innocent, but she’s not evil. \n“Karen is a child in adult’s clothing and easily used and manipulated. \n“This was never about the reward money, something else was going on. We need the truth now.” \nMatthews also insisted in a Mirror interview there were “others” involved in the kidnap of her daughter on the estate where she lived in Dewsbury, West Yorks, and wants police to reinvestigate. Karen at the time of her daughter Shannon's disappearance \nJulie, who is played by Sheridan Smith in BBC drama The Moorside about nine-year-old Shannon’s kidnap in March 2008, admits she is obsessed by the crime. \nShe admitted she was taken in by Matthews’ appalling lies during the hunt for the youngster, but started to have her suspicions after she was found alive. \nJulie added: “When Shannon was missing I was busy in the community centre sorting out the posters and supporting Karen. \n\"I was more concerned about finding Shannon and obsessed with keeping her name in the news. Karen and her partner Craig Meehan when Shannon was missing (Photo: Daily Mirror) \n“But after she was found alive I started to look at what had gone on. \n“I got straight on the computer to look at pictures of Karen and how she was when she made appeals. \n\"The first one seemed genuine but the one where she held a teddy bear up was weird. It just wasn’t right. \n“Then you start thinking about how she was in the centre, laughing and joking when the cameras were not there.

There started to be more talk on the estate. A lot of people were saying, ‘There’s more to this.’ \n“There was something not right and we all knew it. Me and Nat (neighbour Natalie Brown) were talking about the doubts. \n\"It wasn’t anything in particular, it was just a feeling. Then one night Nat called me down to her house. \n“She told me she wanted to confront Karen but she knew she wouldn’t meet her on her own, but that she trusted me.” A view showing the now boarded up former home of Shannon Matthews in Dewsbury Moor (Photo: PA) \nJulie told how she phoned Matthews, who had left the estate to stay with her brother when Shannon was found after nearly a month. \nShe said: “I told her, ‘Natalie wants answers.’ But Karen was scared and said, ‘She’ll hit me.’ “I said, ‘No you daft t**t I’ll be there’. And she said, ‘OK.’” \nNext day, Julie and Natalie got in police officer Christine ­Freeman’s unmarked police car where Matthews, dating Craig Meehan at the time, was sat in the front. \nJulie added: “Christine knew our suspicions and had wanted to be there for our meeting. I put my hand on Karen’s shoulder to reassure her. Sheridan Smith plays Julie in the BBC drama The Moorside (Photo: Getty) \n\"I said, ‘Right, Natalie’s got some questions for you. Don’t feel afraid because I’m here.’ It was like I was good cop and Natalie was bad cop. \n\"And she said, ‘OK.’ I went silent but kept my hand on her shoulder. I gave Natalie the nod and she went for it. \n“Natalie kept repeating the same thing. Then Karen let out a big sigh and it was like an explosion. A relief. She said, ‘You’re right. That’s what happened.’ It was like getting it off her chest. \n“The first thing I thought was, ‘S**t.’ S**t.’ Me and Natalie looked at each other and thought, ‘What now?’ Sheridan Smith as Julie in The Moorside \n“Christine got out the car to phone in and I was consoling Karen. She cried all the way to the station but almost in relief. Natalie and Christine were talking between themselves. \n“I got Karen out of the car. I think I had to help her. I said to her, ‘You’re all right, I’ll walk you to the cells or however far they let me. I’ll always be your friend. \n“As we got inside and were separated she said, ‘Love you Julie.’ I said ‘I love you too.’ But I felt hurt and conned. She’d lied to me and I felt like I let everyone down.” \nMatthews, 41, was jailed for eight years over the plot along with her partner in crime Michael Donovan, who got the same sentence. Shannon Matthews was abducted by her mum (Photo: PA) \nJulie was her only regular prisoner during the four years she served and her need to find the truth grew. \nShe said: “Every time I saw her I ­challenged her story. She would add little bits on and then take little bits off. \n“We talked about her evidence in court. She didn’t do herself any favours. \n“When she was asked, ‘Did you make the child’s tea every night?’ and she said, ‘Yes.’ Bulls**t Karen Matthews has found God since her conviction (Photo: Daily Mirror) \n“She didn’t do anything for those kids. Craig Meehan did it all. She was a really lazy mum. She was trying in court to paint herself as a perfect mother. Which was never going to work. \n“I challenged her but she told different stories. One minute there were others involved, the next people whispering behind her back planning things.” \n“In court they made a big deal out of Donovan’s low IQ but Karen’s is really bad too.” The cast of The Moorside (Photo: BBC) \nDespite “doing her head in” Julie says of Matthews: “I’d love to see her again and give her a cuddle. \n“I think about her and what happened pretty much every day. But I will never stop until I know the truth.” \nAround 7.2million viewers watched The Moorside last Tuesday. The concluding episode airs on Tuesday.
