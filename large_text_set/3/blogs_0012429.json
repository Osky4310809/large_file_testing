Fans pointed out her 'camel toe' (Photo: Instagram) \nLast week it looked like Kylie is finally overtaking her big sister Kim Kardashian when it comes to flooding the internet with raunchy snaps. \nThe young businesswoman recently launched an Instagram account to promote her latest venture - clothes. \nNot one to ever do things by halves, the cheeky teen shared two pictures of herself flashing her curvy rear to camera on the new page. \nThe polaroid-style photos see the star pulling down her jeans to reveal her bum as she poses seductively with her back to camera. \nOn her top half, Kylie - who is sporting a platinum blonde wig - is just wearing a red lace bra.

Kylie came under fire from fans after posting this picture (Photo: Instagram) She's not shy about flashing her flesh (Photo: Instagram) \n“Promoting smoking? classy,” wrote one, with another commenter sarcastically saying, “wow ur such a good model to young girls, and most of your fans are young girls what is ur problem? [sic]” \nOne concerned fan highlighted not only the dangers of smoking, but the destructive effects it will have on her skin. \n“Smoking is bad… you will end up with skin like a old leather handbag… jus sayin,” they pointed out.
