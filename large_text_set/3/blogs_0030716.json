Photo by Claire Lower. \nHello, and welcome back to to What’s Cooking? , the weekly open thread where you get to share all of your brilliant thoughts, advice, recipes, and opinions on all things edible. This week, I want to talk secret food habits. Advertisement \nI think people, as eaters, have two sides to them. There’s the eater you show to the world—the one who uses proper utensils and appropriately seasons their food—and then there is the feral eater. The feral eater comes out when no one’s around. It’s the eating personality you embrace when your partner is out of town or you’re just too tired to give a damn about what’s “right.” The feral eater is bold and adventurous, and asks questions like “why can’t I just eat saltines with butter and nutritional yeast for supper?” \nSo I would like to know how you eat at your most feral. I want to know what foods you consume when there’s no one else around, and what you eat when there are no judging eyes peering over your shoulder. You probably don’t need questions to get you started, but I’m going to give you a few anyway: Advertisement What’s the strangest thing you’ve ever put on ramen? My go-to “I’m all alone and feeling like a trash panda” meal is instant ramen (beef flavor) with the water drained out before adding the seasoning packet in. I then toss in a string cheese and some frozen peas. It kind of congeals into one super salty, cheesy mass. It’s good. Have you ever put Doritos on a tuna sandwich? Apparently it’s a more popular practice than I initially suspected. Which condiment do you overuse to the point of impropriety? I put sour cream on pretty much everything and get panicky if I don’t have it in the house. I also am in the habit of eating large flakes of maldon salt by itself, which I call “snack salt.” It really upsets my loved ones. What’s your stance on expired foods? I don’t eat a ton of expired food, but I routinely consume expired diet Coke. It tastes a little less sweet than un-expired diet Coke, and I like it a lot. (I know, I know. This is a terrible, very bad habit.) Do you have a deep love for a much-hated food? I’m a big fan of lima beans, and some people get really angry about that. I think my ex basically broke up with me because I put them in mac and cheese one time . Who is your secret fast food love? I’m pretty obsessed with McDonald’s, particularly Egg McMuffins and Double Cheeseburgers. ( Not the McDouble, which has less cheese.) \nBut enough about me, I want to hear all about your weird little food habits. In order to keep this pleasant, I would ask that everybody be chill and non-judgmental. I want this to be a safe space.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:27:57.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
