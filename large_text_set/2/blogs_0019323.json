It is the most expensive home for sale in America — a four-level, 38,000-square-foot mansion in Bel Air, Calif., with a 270-degree view of mountains, ocean and the Los Angeles skyline.\nDeveloper Bruce Makowsky built it, saying he wanted to create the most luxurious home in the United States.\n“I saw the opportunity because people spend so much time on their toys — planes, boats and yachts — but they live in the home 12 hours a day,” Makowsky said in a phone interview. “Home should be the best it can possibly be. A place you never have to want to leave.”\nThe Bel Air mansion — with a price tag of $250 million — has every toy imaginable.\nThe garage in the mansion in Bel Air, Calif., comes with 12 rare cars — including a 1936 Mercedes 540K that costs $15 million alone. (Courtesy of Berlyn Photography) The garage is a more than $30 million feature of the home. It comes with 12 cars — a limited-edition Pagani, a 1936 Mercedes 540K (that costs $15 million alone), a Bugatti, a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley are just a few in the collection — and its own staff member.\n[ A look inside the D.C.-area’s most expensive homes for sale ]\nThe listing price includes 2,500 bottles that fill the home’s two wine cellars.

There’s something for every man, woman or child — the candy wall,” Makowsky said.\nIn case the views aren’t helping you relax, there’s a massage room complete with a masseuse.\nThe 250 pieces of art were selected for the home.

These features are made from the 50 different types of stones inside and outside the house that were shipped in from Italy. The 85-foot pool also houses an 18-foot-wide hydraulic television screen that rises over the pool and costs $2 million.\n“Like a mega yacht, we’ve thought of everything,” Makowsky said. “It really touches every sense that makes you feel special.”\nFor information on the mansion at 924 Bel Air Rd., contact real estate agent Branden Williams at Williams & Williams Estates at 310-776-0737 or brandenwilliams@mac.com.", "external_links": ["https://www.toptenrealestatedeals.com/homes/weekly-ten-best-home-deals/", "https://www.thewilliamsestates.com/", "https://twitter.com/@vptwritenow"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:02:17.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
