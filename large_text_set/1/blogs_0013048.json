ET Soros Bet Against Trump Rally And Lost…$1B By Johanna Bennett \nThe stock market rally that followed Donald Trump ’s surprise victory in the 2016 presidential election has not been kind to George Soros . The billionaire hedge fund manager lost $1 billion , having bet, incorrectly so, that stock prices would decline in the wake of the Nov. 8 election, according to the WSJ. \nSoros was a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. His hedge fund, Soros Fund Management , manages about $30 billion. \nAs the Wall Street Journal reported today: \nLast year, Mr. Soros returned to trading at Soros Fund Management LLC, which manages about $30 billion for Mr. Soros and his family. Mr. Soros was lured back by the opportunities to profit from what he saw as coming economic troubles. \nMr. Soros was cautious about the market going into November and became more bearish immediately after Mr. Trump’s election, according to people close to the matter. The stance proved a mistake—the stock market has rallied on expectations that Mr. Trump’s policies will boost corporate earnings and the overall economy. \nAs a result, some of Mr. Soros’s trading positions incurred losses approaching $1 billion, the people say. Mr. Soros adjusted his positions and exited many of his bearish bets late last year, avoiding further losses, the people added. \nThe broader portfolio held by Mr. Soros’s firm performed better, posting profits before and after the election from long-held investments in sectors including financials and industrials, according to people familiar with the firm. Those gains helped Soros Fund Management gain about 5% on the year. \nOthers fared much better. Trump supporter Carl Icahn reaped big returns on the day Trump was declared winner of the presidential election. And citing people close to the matter, the WSJ reports that Stanley Druckenmiller , Soros’s former deputy, racked up sizable gains, having anticipated the market rally.
