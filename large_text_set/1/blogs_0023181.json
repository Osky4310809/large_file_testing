Pedowood: The \"Harvard\" Of Hollywood Child Acting Schools Is An Apparent Haven For Sex Offenders, Crime by William Craddick - Jan 26, 2017 5:17 PM \nShocking facts indicate one of Hollywood's most prestigious child acting schools appears to be a haven for child sex abusers and location of multiple celebrity deaths related to drug abuse. Trump Asks \"What The Hell's Going In Chicago?\" Gets One-Word Answer Jan 26, 2017 7:05 PM 0 SHARES \nAfter threatening to \"send in The Feds\" yesterday - after seeing the \"carnage\" in Chicago - President Trump asked (rhetorically) during his address to Congressional Republicans today, \"what the hell is going in Chicago?\" He received a surprising one-word answer that seemed to sum things up rather well... \n\"Democrats\"... \nwhile only time will tell how/if Trump will follow through on his campaign promises to crack down on rising violence in America's inner-cities, we suspect any approach taken by the new administration will be a welcome change from the Obama administration's parting efforts to delegitimize Chicago's police force by effectively labeling it as a racist organization that the habitually resorts to the use of \"deadly force\" in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. \nThey may have a point! \nWith 44 homicides already recorded, Chicago is on pace for 60 murders in the opening month of January which would exceed the two-decade record high set last year.

As Chicago residents, she feared more for her sons life had he stayed in Chicago and truly believed he would be safer being deployed to the Middle East. Upon being honorably discharged after serving a tour, he returned to Chicago and his mother. \nShortly after his return Abner was shot by a gang member and killed on a Chicago street. \nGarcia was a member of a mentoring program at the YMCA that pairs youths with veterans. \nThis is Rahm/Alinsky's Chicago. \nDid you ever notice how Dem-controlled places are consistently corrupt, crime-ridden, and falling apart? \nPerhaps Mr. Trump should point that out to the Black voters of America. \nMan I am becoming envious of Trumps kids, you know you got a decent start in life with a dad like that. \nSerious ... \nBut, but I thought \"he will not divide us\" \n/all the sarc I can muster from those libtards CompassionateCo...

Wayne LaPierre and his kooky supporters are causing all the crime in Chicago not the poor, oppressed, and police brutalized 65-IQ subhuman primates sane people call NIGGERS. You people just make me sick with your fucking racism. They ain't even done nothing! It's rural white goyim owning guns that is the cause of all crime. Quit oppressing them with your institutional racism, white privilege, microaggressions, and your criminal justice system! THEY AIN'T EVEN DONE NOTHING!!! Don't believe the crime statistics either because they were compiled by the KKK. Rural white goyim gun owners CAUSE CRIME! #womensmarch #endracism #imstillwithher #hewillnotdivideus #lovetrumpshate \n\"what the hell is going in Chicago?\" \nObamanation! \nThis is my kind of town, Chicago is My kind of town, Chicago is My kind of people too People who smile at you JBPeebles Jan 26, 2017 7:22 PM \nI was in Chicago last summer. I chanced upon a brewing encounter between city police and a small assortment of African Americans on a major street downtown. \nThe way they looked at the police was quite telling. Lit with flashing blue, I could see the people looking at the police with a mixture or fear and rage. It's quite an unpleasant face they were making. \nObviously the state of relations between CPD and its residents of color is in crisis. People are terrified of the police. At the same time, though, there was a stubborn defiance in them. They'd seen the police do terrible things. And they weren't just going away. Whatever the long list of demands and justifiable anger at the police response, it's time to bring Chiraq back under control. \nThe city is too important to let the gangsta culture rule. Death rates are too high. Intervention is a must. With the scope of the crisis defined, we can understand the problem and begin to deal with it. \nBetter yet, why don't we let the people police themselves? This can't be done without guns. Firearm ownership was severely restricted back in the 70's. \nChicago is the most segregated large northern city in the U.S.. It's also a city where the black middle class grew, removed as they were from white-owned businesses. Drive through the south side and you'll see the upper middle class homes and wide avenues--there is money there. \nGo through some neighborhoods and you're in very dangerous places, on a par with Haiti or Sub-Saharan Africa. \nLet's let South side Chicagoans do what's right for their neighborhoods. Rolling back the gang influence takes a lot of work and overhandedness can backfire. By liberalizing firearm ownership, the good people of Chicago can keep gang-prone yongsters in line; killing some yes, but also insuring the safety of the majority, who are victims in a society that denies them their right to firearms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:36:05.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
