It became a “symbol” to the environmental movement, as The Times put it, and Trump’s move to revive it is a major step away from the energy obstructionism of the past eight years. \nThis adds to the major moves Trump has already started making to put an end to Obama-era politics, including abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership and repealing the Affordable Care Act.   \n“From now we are going to start making pipelines in the United States,” Trump said from the Oval Office, according to Bloomberg . \nHe also said the pipeline construction would bring in “a lot of jobs, 28,000 jobs,” Trump said, according to The Hill. “Great construction jobs.” \nThis is a man of his word. From day one, Donald Trump has made tremendous moves that prove his presidency is going to be one of action. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and be sure to add your thoughts and opinions to the comment section below.
