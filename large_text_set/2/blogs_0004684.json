Chowdaheadz was allegedly selling counterfeit material. (Image Credit: Woburn Police) \nWhile searching the Chowdaheadz facility, police seized t-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, and other items. Business records, production material and equipment were also seized. \nCounterfeit charges will be brought against Chowdaheadz by summons. \nOn Saturday, Chowdaheadz posted a message to customers on its Facebook page . \nWe respect federal, state and local law enforcement officials, the work they do and the sacrifices they make for our community. And, we respect the legitimate intellectual property rights of others, but will vigorously always defend ourselves against any and all allegations that have no basis in law and fact. \nWe will be in touch soon with more details but know that we are 100% open for business, are not going anywhere, and most importantly we are ready for an exciting game this weekend! \nWoburn Police Chief Robert Ferullo said the investigation is ongoing. \n“I would like to praise the hard work across all of the agencies involved in this case including Woburn Police and investigators from Topsfield Police, Homeland Security and the NFL,” Ferullo said. “We will continue to assist in any way we can to aid this investigation moving forward.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:15:40.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
