She has spoken at the UN multiple times to spread the messages she believes in, and incorporates those values into her daily life and various film projects the best she can. Her latest attempt to spread a positive message about things she finds important is a new Instagram account created for the sole purpose of posting outfits that she wears to press events in the lead up to Beauty and the Beast ‘s release in March . \nWhile this may sound like a shallow or frivolous endeavor — an Instagram for clothes only isn’t exactly groundbreaking for celebrities — Watson’s purpose here is more varied than just showing off her latest dress while she jet sets around the world. Each outfit featured in the first three posts are eco-friendly in some way and come from a designer that Watson has worked with before and who shares her commitment to making the world a better place.
