(Photo by Bob Levey/Getty Images) \nHouston (CBS HOUSTON) – The Houston Texans are still playing in the NFL Playoffs, but rumors about their head coach moving to a different team don’t seem to be going away. \nOn January 1st, hours before the final regular season game Jay Glazer of Fox reported Bill O’Brien might be a surprise firing. Now hours before the Texans face the New England Patriots in the Divisional round of the playoffs Glazer again is reporting possible moves for Bill O’Brien. \nOn FOX’s pregame show Jay Glazer said to watch for the 49ers vacant head coaching position to be filled by either Bill O’Brien or Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. \n— Chelsea Callahan (@chelly_cal) January 14, 2017 \nThe 49ers are the only team left with a vacant head coaching spot. The Chargers, Jaguars, Bills, Broncos and Rams all filled their spots in the past week. \nThis obviously doesn’t mean that O’Brien is headed to San Francisco or even would consider it, but reports of him leaving, being fired or wanting a change keep coming from Glazer and other NFL reporters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:29:09.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
