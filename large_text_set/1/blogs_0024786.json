The residence includes many Disney-themed items, like murals of the castles that inspired Sleeping Beauty’s home.\n21 Royal Disney\nHosts share stories of the artwork and items throughout the residence before guests are taken to an opulent dining room.\nFor dinner, guests will be treated to an “epicurean theater,” in which chefs Andrew Sutton and Justin Monson will tell stories of their inspiration for each dish.\n“More than a time to eat and drink, this is a chance for our guests to discover the extraordinary 21 Royal space through the food and the storytelling — to live the 21 Royal lifestyle, if only for one magical evening,” Monson said in a statement.\nThe evening ends with dessert on the private balcony, where guests can catch views of the Rivers of America or watch the park's fireworks displays up close.\nThe experience, which costs about $15,000 for a party of 12, gives you a sneak peek into what it could have been like to attend a dinner party hosted by Walt and Lillian Disney.\nRead the original article on Travel + Leisure .
