(Photo: PA Video) \nThe Chilean scored from a rebound after initially missing from the penalty spot. \nBut if the Gunners were motivated by heading into half-time at 1-1, it didn't show in the second 45. \nRobert Lewandowski scored eight minutes after the restart, and Thiago made it 3-1 six minutes after that. (Photo: Bongarts) \nThe capitulation continued when the Spaniard doubled his tally seven minutes later and almost certainly ended the tie. \nSubstitute Thomas Muller then added insult to injury in the 88th minute by making it five. \nSpeaking in his post-match press conference, Wenger said: \"It was a strange game, in the first half we played well. We had two good chances before half-time. (Photo: Bongarts) \n\"In the second half we suffered two blows in Koscielny and the two goals we conceded in the 53rd and 56th minutes. \n\"The real problem came after the third goal, we lost our organisation, we looked mentally jaded and very vulnerable from that moment on. \n\"The last 25 minutes was a nightmare for us - we looked like we had no response.\" poll loading What should Arsene Wenger do at the end of the season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:12:33.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
