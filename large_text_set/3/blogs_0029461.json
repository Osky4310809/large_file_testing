Stagecoach had control of the franchise for 21 years, the BBC reported. \nThe RMT union said the Chinese state was now set to make \"a killing at the British taxpayers' expense\". \nBut the Department for Transport said MTR has experience operating the Hong Kong Metro and was well-placed to deliver “smooth and rapid” journeys for London commuters. \nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling said it was \"great news\" for rail passengers following the recent announcement of a consultation on the South Eastern franchise. \nHe said: \"First MTR South Western Trains Limited will deliver the improvements that people tell us they want right across the South Western franchise area, from Bristol and Exeter, to Southampton and Portsmouth, to Reading, Windsor and London. \n\"We are delivering the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century and this franchise will deliver real changes for passengers, who can look forward to modern trains, faster journeys and a more reliable service.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T10:11:32.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
