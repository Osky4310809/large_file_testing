Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Mar 22, 2017 | No Comments Pin Shares 11 \nApple yesterday launched the red iPhone 7 under its (PRODUCT)RED campaign. The handset is scheduled to go on sale in over 40 countries in a couple of days from now. Going by the press photos and the unboxing video posted by YouTuber MKBHD , the red iPhone 7 looks terrific. \nHowever, our comment section, social media, and online forums are filled with complaints regarding one aspect of the red iPhone 7: its white front. Arguably, the phone would have looked a lot better with a black front as the concept renders from artist Benjamin Geskin below show. \nApple could have also paid attention to detail and made the Touch ID rim in front of the device red to go along with the color of the rear panel. It seems like a rare oversight by a company which is famous for its attention to details. \n— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) March 21, 2017 \nPersonally, if Apple would have launched the red iPhone 7 with a black front, I would have purchased one on day one. While not official, I hope Apple gets around to releasing the red iPhone 8 with a black front as well. \nWhat do you think about the red iPhone 7? Will you be buying one? Or, like me, are you also disappointed that it does not come with a black front? Take part in our poll below and don’t forget to drop a comment and let us know your reasoning as well. Like this post?
