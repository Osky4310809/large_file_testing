We know this, you know this, everyone knows it. But, for someone who’s been in the spotlight for as long as Spears has, she’s also shockingly down to earth. After all, Britney’s just as comfortable in workout gear as she is getting all dressed for the VMAs . It’s safe to say she knows how to make any situation work for her — including her very own at-home outfit montage. \nAnd now she’s transformed her hallway into a full-time catwalk. It’s not the first time our girl Britney put on her own “fashion show” at home for her fans. \nJust doing my own runway show \nA post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Mar 2, 2017 at 10:36pm PST \nIt’s not even the second time Spears hit the home runway . \nAnother day, another runway \nA post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Mar 5, 2017 at 2:54pm PST \nIt’s now the third time that the superstar strutted her stuff down a catwalk of her own making — and we can’t look away. \nGirl knows how to work that walk! Option 1 or option 2? #ootd \nA post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Mar 17, 2017 at 5:35pm PDT \nThis time, she’s asking her fans for help picking between outfits. “Option 1 or option 2?” she asks while modeling to her own music. \nPersonally, we love the bright color of the red dress — but we can’t deny that the second dress has its own strengths. And Spears’ fans are certainly sharing their love for it in the comments, shouting out their support for the pink number. Paired with that choker and black platform pumps, both looks are seriously bomb. \nIt’s official. \nBritney Spears is queen of the catwalk. And not just the one at her house. While attending a fashion show with BF Sam Asghari this week, Britney was literally given the shirt off a model’s back . Talk about paying homage to the queen. \n\nIt’s Britney, bitch. Bow down. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T02:02:14.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
