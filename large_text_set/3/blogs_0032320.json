By David Leopold March 28, 2017 \nLast week’s health care debacle was another stunning embarrassment for President Trump, who has little to show for his first 100 days in office other than bluster, bravado, and failure. \nSo it was no surprise Monday afternoon when Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in an obvious effort to change the subject, showed up in the White House briefing room to read a statement decrying state and local governments that, he claimed, have “adopted policies designed to frustrate the enforcement of our immigration laws,” including refusing to honor ICE “detainer requests.” The attorney general went on to brazenly threaten state and local governments with the withholding and clawback of $4 billion in critical law enforcement and community-safety funding unless they goose-step behind the Trump administration as it implements the mass deportation plan. Advertisement \nAttacking immigrants is a role Sessions has prepped for his whole career. \nHe cited a legally flawed 2016 memorandum from the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General that speculated that several cities and counties across the United States may be in violation of a Section 1373 — a very narrow provision of the immigration law that prohibits state and local governments from limiting communication with ICE about “the immigration or citizenship status” of individuals. Sessions conveniently failed to mention that the sketchy memo did not find any state or local jurisdiction had actually violated the law. Nor did it recommend that public safety funds be withheld. In fact, there is nothing in the federal immigration law that requires state and local law enforcement to collaborate with immigration agents in rounding up noncitizens for deportation. To the contrary, the 10th Amendment of the Constitution prohibits the federal government from coercing states into becoming immigration enforcement agents.

But ICE detainers raise very serious constitutional concerns for local jurisdictions. The federal courts have ruled that the Fourth Amendment forbids the government from locking someone up without a warrant signed by a judge or probable cause.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T09:22:08.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
