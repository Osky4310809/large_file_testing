When he and Michelle constantly defined relationship goals\n\"Michelle ... Michelle LaVaughn Robinson of the South Side,\" Obama addressed FLOTUS during his farewell address while the world broke down in tears. \"For the past 25 years you have not only been my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend.\"\n\"You took on a role you didn’t ask for. And you made it your own with grace and with grit and with style, and good humor,\" he said. \"You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody and a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.\"\nAre you not crying yet?\n\"You have made me proud, and you have made the country proud.\"\n#UltimateRelationshipGoalsForever\n2. When he kicked it with our favorite celebs\nFrom Beyoncé and Jay Z to Chance the Rapper, Ellen and Oprah, Barack hanging out with so many of our favorite celebrities has only made us love them more.\nI mean, he even freestyle rapped with Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n3. When he taught us invaluable lessons\nWhen people went low, Obama never had any trouble going high. Though he has spoken countless words of wisdom during his time in office, this GIF of Obama teaching Kid President about the importance of kindness and respect really speaks to us.\n4. When he formed a life-long friendship\nWhile VP Joe Biden and POTUS may be going their separate ways, the bromance like no other will live on forever in our hearts and our memes.\nAt Obama's farewell address in Chicago, he addressed Biden, \"the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware’s favorite son.\"\n\"You were the first decision I made as a nominee, and it was the best. Not just because you have been a great vice president, but because in the bargain I gained a brother. And we love you and Jill like family. And your friendship has been one of the great joys of our lives,\" Obama said.\nWe're not crying, you're crying.\n5. When he cracked some legendary dad jokes\nSasha and Malia have one hell of a dad. Barack never shied away from embarrassing his two girls with a hearty dad joke, especially on holidays.\n6. When he dropped the mic on many occasions\nKing of the mic drop, Obama has made so many legendary speeches and performances during his time as president that it reached a point where he literally decided to drop the mic.\nObama first showed off his bold move on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon in 2012, and chose to revive it years later.\nThe GIF above shows the president at his final White House Correspondents' Dinner in April 2016, where he ended his speech with the iconic words, \"Obama out.\"\n*mic drop*\n7. When he showed off some smooth moves\nOver their eight years in the White House, Barack and Michelle busted countless moves, proving they are, in fact, cooler than us.\n8. When he never stopped reminding America it's already great\nWhile Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" has been used ad nauseum, in Obama's eyes, the nation and the people in it have never stopped being great.\n9. When he campaigned to help make history, yet again\nBarack Obama became America's first black president, and when it came time to step down he made extraordinary efforts to help Hillary Clinton become the nation's first female president.\nThis GIF of the two arm in arm at Clinton's Democratic National Convention will always give us some serious feels.\n10. When he asked us to never stop believing\nOn Jan. 10, Obama delivered his inspirational farewell address in Chicago. After reflecting on the amazing eight years he and his family spent serving in the White House, Obama thanked his fellow Americans and simply asked that we never stop believing.\n\" ... Whether you are young or whether you’re young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president — the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago,\" he said. \"I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change — but in yours.\"\nExcuse us, we're out of tissues.\nBONUS: The Obamas got real emotional at the president's farewell address", "external_links": ["http://giphy.com/embed/zVlvyY9c3vY0o?html5=true", "http://giphy.com/embed/3o7qDSOvfaCO9b3MlO?html5=true", "http://giphy.com/embed/3o6Ztdq3STfK6mMniE?html5=true", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/zbLczcwI.m3u8", "http://giphy.com/embed/l0MYMmf2B8XYk1xx6?html5=true", "http://giphy.com/embed/rzi1XUihZsWZ2?html5=true", "http://giphy.com/embed/2ADJrKQnqtZhm?html5=true", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/politics/obama-farewell-address-speech.html", "http://giphy.com/embed/l4JyYCo1POYWC9HmE?html5=true", "http://giphy.com/embed/26gYDx96QUTWgJFdu?html5=true", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/zbLczcwI.jpg", "http://giphy.com/embed/3o6wrdDVQRYLdyAivm?html5=true", "http://giphy.com/embed/3otPoU7OdyD8tVTGeY?html5=true", "http://giphy.com/embed/26FLgZz9yAQavjcvS?html5=true"], "published": "2017-01-12T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:32:37.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
