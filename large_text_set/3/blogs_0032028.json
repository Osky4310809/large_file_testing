James Ocholi while the nominee from Gombe would be replacing former Minister for Environment Ms Amina Mohammed who had gone to serve in the United Nations as a deputy Secretary General. \nThe list of ministerial nominees is coming at a time when the Senate stood down for two weeks consideration of the request of President Buhari for the appointment of Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs). \nThe Senate based its decision on what it termed disregard for its resolutions. \nThe upper legislative chamber specifically berated the President for appearing to be doing nothing about the rejection of Ibrahim Magu a the Chairman of the EFCC but allowing him to function in acting capacity. \nThe senate stressed that it was wrong to leave any appointee in acting capacity even after he had been rejected twice by the senate. \nNAN.ng", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:15:53.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
