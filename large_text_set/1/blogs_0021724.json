It took place at Harvard and at Boston Children's Hospital.\nSEE ALSO: This Albert Einstein robot can help you learn science \nMade of soft fibers including silicone, the robotic sleeve bonds itself to the heart by wrapping around it, essentially becoming part of the beating organ as it moves in synch with it.\nIn doing this, it provides circulatory support for hearts not functioning properly, supporting blood flow through a sleeve that manages to not come in contact with blood, as explained in the study .\n\nThis design marks a departure from the way VADs support heart function, as those devices must interfere with blood flow in order to assist in healthy pumping of the heart.\n\"Using current VADs, the heart and one or both of the great vessels are cannulated, blood is removed from the heart, and blood is then pumped into the aorta or pulmonary artery,\" the researchers write. \"In this scenario, the VAD assumes the function of one or both of the failing ventricles of the heart.\"\nBut clotting complications that can require potentially risky blood thinners make VADs a less than ideal solution for those suffering heart failure. \n\nA) How muscle fibers are oriented right outside the heart inspired the design of the VAD. B) The soft fibers of the robotic sleeve can compress and twist along with the motion of the heart. C) Silicone casting was used to produce the new implantable device. D) 3-D printing was also used to construct the implantable robot. E) These are areas of the heart which the robotic sleeve can wrap around.\nImage: American Association for the Advancement of Science\nResearchers tested out the new robotic sleeve using a pig heart to examine how effectively it supports heart function.\n\"The soft robotic sleeve we describe took inspiration from native heart muscle and was designed to augment cardiac function by closely replicating it, instead of disrupting it,\" the researchers wrote.\nIn this way, soft robotic techniques were used to \"replicate the heartâ€™s motion.\"\nThe study explains that the broader field of robotics is facing new developments as softer materials are being used in innovative new ways.\n\"The soft robotic sleeve ... took inspiration from a native heart muscle.\"\n\"However, the field is being transformed by a new wave of soft robots that are constructed using a combination of elastomers, fibers, and other filler materials,\" the study explains. \"This approach provides opportunities to create robots that are well suited for intimate interactions with humans and with tunable material properties to match biological tissues.\"\nSuch designs in medical robots can provide patients with more options, such as with the sleeve that wraps around the heart.\n\"The sleeve can be customized for each patient,\" Dr. Roche said in the statement. The parts of the heart involved, and the strength of the pressure the sleeve uses, can be adjusted according to a patient's individual case.\nRobots have been used for a lot of things, from being a personal writing machine to delivering food to your doorstep , but helping a person's heart pump makes them even more useful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T03:53:03.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
