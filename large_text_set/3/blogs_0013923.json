Sign In 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' Sequel That Isn't a Sequel Sets 2018 Release Share on Tumblr \nFans of David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo are upset all over again with the updated news that a sequel will be moving ahead without Fincher or stars Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig. We heard all about the new direction for the property back in the fall of 2015 , when it was revealed the next installment would be, out of order, The Girl in the Spider's Web . Here's the latest: \nSo we're really finally getting another movie in the Millennium series this time? \nYes, this is really happening, per official Sony Pictures announcement, and it will indeed be an adaptation of David Lagercrantz's Spider's Web . The book is more of a one-off adventure involving hacker heroine Lisbeth Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist, so more easily accepted as something separate from Dragon Tattoo . \nDo they have a director? \nYes. Fede Alvarez ( Don't Breathe ), who was reported as being considered last fall , is taking the helm. He has also worked on the script with Jay Basu ( Monsters: Dark Continent ), adding to the previously known-about draft by Oscar-nominated screenwriter Steven Knight ( Dirty Pretty Things ). \nDo they have a new Lisbeth? \nNot yet, but the \"global search\" is underway, though Variety claims the front-runners are Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, the latter having been up for the role for Dragon Tattoo years ago. Alvarez is quoted as saying, \"Lisbeth Salander is the kind of character any director dreams of bringing to life. We’ve got a great script and now comes the most fun part — finding our Lisbeth.\" Apparently, Alicia Vikander, who'd been named back in 2015 for the part, passed. \nWhat about a new Blomkvist? \nNope. The only person listed for the movie is Jamaican actor Kevin Navayne, who stars in an upcoming Marcus Garvey biopic, but his role is unknown. \nSo this isn't really a sequel, is it? \nSony is apparently calling it both a sequel and a reboot, which is how it's looked the last couple years. It's reminiscent of the Thomas Harris adaptations involving Hannibal Lecter, especially with Manhunter and The Silence of the Lambs . Characters were also recast in the more direct series of films, though they tended to have overlaps. But so have the James Bond movies, while Lagercrantz sees Lisbeth as being like Batman and Spider-Man, who are constantly being rebooted, actor-wise. \nWhat if we want to see the rest of Stieg Larrson's Millennium novels come to life? \nWell, fortunately, they already have. While we'll never get a Fincher-helmed The Girl Who Played with Fire or a Mara-led The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest , those books and Dragon Tattoo were made into very good Swedish movies back in 2009 with Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth (pictured above). You can even pretend Spider's Web is a sequel to those, if you like, since we're not likely to ever see Rapace return for an adaptation of that or Lagercrantz's new fifth installment. \nDoes Spider's Web have a release date? \nYes. Following a shoot set to begin this September, the movie is scheduled for release on October 5, 2018. Like it?
