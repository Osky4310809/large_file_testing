That means no plot details, no character descriptions, nothing. Abandon hope all ye who enter here.\nBut the crowd of mostly movie-theater owners and press seemed to have a good time with it, and many risked reacting on Twitter because, well — they liked it, an outcome that's less likely to irritate the studio. Of those, some even liked it so much as to say it's the best since the original.\nSEE ALSO: Sony teases first 'Dark Tower' footage: So the Man in Black has the Force?\nBut then, after the last 19 or so Pirates movies, most of which were unloved for their muddled myth-building and meandering, forgettable story (and the franchise seeming to overstay its welcome in general), this wasn't a very high bar.\nAlso the action scenes are really well staged and easy to follow. So much better than the last one. #PiratesoftheCaribbean\n— Steven Weintraub (@colliderfrosty) March 29, 2017\nPirates 5 is definitely the best one since the first. Admittedly, that isn't saying much but it does occasionally capture that magic.\n— Germain Lussier (@GermainLussier) March 29, 2017\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a pleasant surprise. Continues the legacy, focuses on the characters and the world.\n— Peter Sciretta (@slashfilm) March 29, 2017\nFans of #PiratesoftheCaribbean will not be disappointed. Pirates 5 is a very fun, action packed adventure w subtle nods to the ride itself.\n— Yolanda Machado (@SassyMamainLA) March 29, 2017\nYolanda is right: If you like the Pirates movies, Dead Men will wash over you like a warm, fizzy wave at high tide. That much we can say. If you were getting repetition boredom anxiety attacks from the last 27 Pirates movies, but someone forces you to sit through it, you'll probably come out OK.\nThere's just only so much you can do with ships and anchors and maps and ropes and sabers and teeth and hair and wide eyes, you know?\n— Josh L. Dickey (@JLDlite) March 29, 2017\nBut that's all I feel at liberty to say right now; anything more and Disney would kill me, and then I'd be dead, and ... dead ... men ... tell ... no ... tales .\nWATCH: ‘Beauty and the Beast’ cast tell us their characters’ musical guilty pleasure", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NnfcuenvOjbE8JGVnHMcxTqxpH8=/http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fthumbs%2FbRHLkcb5.jpg", "https://twitter.com/JLDlite/status/846978546308431873", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/bRHLkcb5.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/SassyMamainLA/status/846960535941865473", "https://twitter.com/GermainLussier/status/846957837251231744", "https://twitter.com/slashfilm/status/846957299231084547", "https://twitter.com/colliderfrosty/status/846957173070614528", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PiratesoftheCaribbean?src=hash"], "published": "2017-03-29T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:19:11.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
