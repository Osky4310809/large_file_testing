Yeah, I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And that’s end of story. Everything else was just…The easy [potshot] is like, ‘Oh, well you cheated on Sandra Bullock.’ That’s the world’s easiest comeback. \nBut, like, bub… it’s not a “comeback” if it’s true??? It’s a fact, and we have the evidence. REX/Shutterstock \nIn general, both women and men cheat. It’s part of life. \nAfter news came out James had extramarital affairs, fans and tabloids sided with Sandy. Giphy \nJames went on to say, \nIt’s like people love to see you fall. And the farther you get, the higher you get, the more they love it. I look at myself now and I look at how I was feeling then, and I think I was completely overreacting as far as letting it really get to me.

That was not a good feeling. \nHe added he’s a “fighter, man.” \nI come from the tradition of if you do something I don’t like, I’m going to punch you. There’s no lawsuits — nothing. We’re just going to fight it out. It’s hard for me to bite my cheeks and not say anything and just look down. \nIn 2013, James married Alexis DeJoria, a drag racer and his fourth wife. He says this marriage is different. \nHe also explained his 11-year marriage to Karla James “doesn’t count.” His reason being that he was ten years younger than her. \nI was 20 when I got with her and she was 30. Isn’t that kind of bad? Like, my daughter’s 22 right now, and I imagine if some 30-year-old dude came round, I’d be like, ‘No, no, no.’ That was kind of scandalous. No ill will [towards Karla], but by the time I was 30 and she was 40, we had nothing — nothing — in common. \nSounds like a great guy, right? \nJames, who appeared on “Celebrity Apprentice” in 2009, was also one of the first celebrities to endorse Donald Trump, so… \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
