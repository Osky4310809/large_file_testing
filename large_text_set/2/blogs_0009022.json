Why don’t you just go to bed?” That’s what this grumpy boxer’s mom asks him when he barks at her. It turns out the dog just doesn’t want to go to bed alone and is trying his best to convince her that she should go to bed too. \nWhen she tells him she’s not tired, and he should just go to bed himself, the Boxer adorably protests. I love at the end, when he seems like he gives up and is saying, “Uh, okay then” and heads off to bed. According to his human, he goes through the same routine every night! What a cutie.
