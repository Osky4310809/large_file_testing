China launches first train service to travel to Britain \nThe train, which is operated by Yiwu Timex Industrial Investments, arrived carrying 34 containers packed with £4 million worth of clothes and other goods and was greeted by a group of officials and local residents. \nThe Chinese and British governments hope the new route will increase trade between the two countries. Transporting goods by rail is cheaper than air freight and quicker than by boat. The service will run once a week for several months in order to gauge demand. If successful the rail link could be made permanent. \nThe link reopens the old Silk Road route that was previously used to transport goods between Europe and Asia.

China is now the world’s biggest exporter, with an annual exports totally £1.85 trillion in 2015. \nDifferent types of rail track in different countries mean the same train cannot travel the whole route and so the containers have to be removed and reloaded onto different carriages at several stages of the journey. \nThe train's name derives from a saying by former Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong, who said: \"The East Wind shall prevail over the West\".
