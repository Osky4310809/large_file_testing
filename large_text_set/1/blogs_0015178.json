So much sugar in so many things.\" \nBut Nutella is actually made up of more than 50% sugar - higher than it looks to be on the image. \nThe official website lists the sugar content as 56.8g per 100g serving, or 56.8%. \nOther ingredients include skimmed milk powder, hazelnuts, cocoa powder and the controversial palm oil.
