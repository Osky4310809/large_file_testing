Gorton was weighing whether to extend a seven-day order blocking parts of Trump’s Executive Order. \nThe case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of several affected immigrants, is one of several that followed Trump’s Jan 27 order, which roiled global travel by barring entry to the U.S. of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Individuals, organizations, politicians and some states called it unconstitutional religious discrimination against Muslims. \nAs GMA News Onine reports, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton on Friday asked Matthew Segal, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) representing the plaintiffs in the Boston case. \n\"Where does it say Muslim countries?\" \nSegal replied... \n\"If your honor's question is, 'Does the word 'Muslim' make a profound presence in this executive order?,' my answer is that it doesn't, ... But the president described what he was going to do as a Muslim ban and then he proceeded to carry it out.\" \nGorton shot back, \n\"Am I to take the words of an executive at any point before or after election as a part of that executive order?\" \nJudge Gorton on Friday asked U.S. Justice Department lawyer Joshua Press how the seven countries had been selected. \nPress responded that the list had come from a law passed in 2015 and amended early last year requiring that citizens of the seven countries apply for visas to enter the United States, \"out of concern about the refugees that were coming, mainly from Syria at that time and terrorist events that were occurring in Europe.\" \nAs we noted previously, only 12.5% of the world's Muslims live in the seven countries on Trump's immigration ban list... \n\nWhich left the judge to decide ( as the full docket explains here ), \n“The language in Section 5 of the EO is neutral with respect to religion, \n\n\"The provisions of Section 5, however, could be invoked to give preferred refugee status to a Muslim individual in a country that is predominately Christian. Nothing in Section 5 compels a finding that Christians are preferred to any other group.” \nGorton wrote there is a rational reason for the Trump administration’s policies. The federal Immigration and Naturalization Act gives the president broad power over immigration. \n“The order provides a reasonably conceivable state of facts (which concerns national security and) that could provide a rational basis for the classification,” he wrote. “Accordingly, this Court declines to encroach upon the “delicate policy judgment” inherent in immigration decisions.” \n\nORDER \n\nFor the forgoing reasons, the Court declines to impose any injunctive relief and will not renew the temporary restraining order that was entered on January 29, 2017 (Docket No. 6). \nFull Order below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:03:31.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
