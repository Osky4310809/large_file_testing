They teach us more about Assyrian art. In general, their sculptures show people in profile, whereas here we have women face on,” said Salih. \nShe said Isis had not been able to extract many of the treasures for fear of the hill collapsing altogether but other removable artefacts, especially pottery, were takenplundered. \nIraqi authorities found 107 items of pottery in a house east of Mosul that were in good condition and most likely exhumed from the tunnels of Nabi Yunus.
