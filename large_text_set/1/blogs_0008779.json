The 36 MB update follows swiftly after the original upgrade to 4.0 last week, which first introduced Android Nougat to the devices.\nThe new build features updated access point name (APN) settings for carriers — which had been the source of some mobile data issues — and a proximity sensor bug fix which occurred during calls. The Oxygen 4.0.1 patch notes also mentions increased system stability, which might be more perceptible than usual as OnePlus was rushing to meet a self-imposed New Year’s Eve deadline for the initial OxygenOS 4.0 rollout.\nFor those who were yet to upgrade to the Nougat-based software, here is the complete list of improvements from OnePlus:\nUpgraded to Android 7.0 Nougat New Notifications Design New Settings Menu Design Multi-Window View Notification Direct Reply Custom DPI Support Added Status Bar Icon Options Improved Shelf Customization Updated APN Settings for select Carriers Fixed Proximity Sensor bug during calls Increased System Stability This is an incremental rollout, so the update will arrive over-the-air to a small percentage of users to begin with before wider distribution in the coming days. Go to settings > about phone > software updates to see if you’re ready to receive the download.\nYou can also visit the OnePlus website via the links below to report bugs or leave feedback on the user-interface direct to OnePlus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T14:21:38.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
