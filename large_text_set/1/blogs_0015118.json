Gen. Arnel Dela Vega (left) was installed on Thursday as commander of the 6th Infantry Division by Philippine Army chief Lt. Gen. Glorioso Miranda. Courtesy of Dennis Arcon, Brigada FM, Cotabato City MAGUINDANAO, Philippines -- The new chief of the Army's 6th Infantry Division took command in a simple transition rite at Camp Siongco in Datu Odin Sinsuat town in Maguindanao on Thursday. Brig. Gen. Arnel Dela Vega took over the post vacated by Major Gen. Carlito Galvez, Jr., now commander of the Western Mindanao Command based in Zamboanga City. The traditional turnover of command was administered by Lt. Gen. Glorioso Miranda, commanding general of the Philippine Army. The 6th ID and all of its component brigades and battalions are under Westmincom. Dela Vega is no stranger to the provinces covered by 6th ID, having served as commander of the 603rd Infantry Brigade, which operates in more than a dozen towns in Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur. He was commander of the military-led anti-crime Task Force Sulu based in Jolo prior to his designation as commanding officer of the 6th ID. Galvez assumed as 6th ID commanding general last September, replacing Major Gen. Edmundo Pangilinan, who was promoted to deputy Philippine Army commander. Pangilinan retired from the military service in November 2016. Dela Vega said that like his predecessors, he will focus on programs complementing Malacañang’s on-going diplomatic overtures with Moro sectors in Central Mindanao.
