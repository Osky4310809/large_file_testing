This young fellas was about to die in a hot car. Fuck that. He was gonna grab his momma’s loaded gun and fire off a couple shots so he could stay in the hot car like a cricket in a pickle jar with a few holes punched in the top. Could he have lived in that car for weeks? No. Just like the cricket, he’ll die eventually no matter how many holes he shoots through the windshield. But, just like the cricket, having those holes will certainly extend the length that he can stay in there. \nSo, if we have any toddler stoolies reading, make you sure you grab your parent’s guns and shoot the shit out of the windshield. It’ll make it cooler in the car and increase your chances of survival. \nNow, I know what the rest of you are thinking. \n“Hey Chaps. Isn’t telling children to shoot the windshield of their parent’s car just a little irresponsible?” \nNo. Windshields are shatter proof. It’s perfectly safe. Thanks, though. \nThat being said, sign this little dude up to be on my team any day. I used to hate when my mom would leave me in the car. This little fella had a long day at daycare and then his mom tries to leave him in the car while she chats it up with her pals? I wish I had the gumption to pull the trigger and cause some damage when my mom “just had to run in for some bread and milk.” Sure, mom. It was fucking hot in there and you took FOREVER.
