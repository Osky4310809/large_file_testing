I’ve seen how the press fawned over Chelsea Clinton and then later Malia and Sasha Obama, but couldn’t wait to criticize me and my siblings when my mom hit the national political stage. \nWell, looks like the “peace and tolerance” liberals are back at their loving ways. Moms on the Upper East Side are freaking out at the prospect of sending their bundles of joy to preschool with President Trump’s grandson. Yes, really. Like their pre-schoolers will come home believing in supply side economics. \nPage Six reports on what’s going on UrbanBaby.com – a place I never want to go, by the way. \nOne of the anonymous contributors to UrbanBaby.com said her son had gotten into Buckley [School], but she didn’t want to send him there because a son of Donald Trump Jr . ’s (likely 4-year-old Spencer Frederick) is said to be going to kindergarten there in the fall. \n“They will be in the same classroom and I don’t think I can deal with this.
