Baby elephants are pulled from their mothers and each of their feet. They are beaten bloody by several men who use hot irons, bullhoos several inches long, shovels. Nails are pounded into their sensitive skin. Elephants will often step on their trunks to kill themselves and infanticide is common. Mothers will kill their babies so they don't have to go through it.Both TripAdvisor and Lonley Planet endorse and feature some of the most abusive trekking camps in the world. The scars covering the elephants heads and bodies tell the heartbreaking tale of the elephants lives. Of those subject to phajaan, 50% die. Of those who survive half of them will go mad. Demand these travel organizations strip these abusive trekking camps of all recommendations and endorsements. This is something that literally keeps me up at night and we can't let this continue. The only way is to let everyone know not to ever ride an elephant at a tourist attraction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T12:05:46.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
