The protest is called the “day without immigrants,” and is already underway. The movement is in response both to the President’s Muslim ban , which is temporarily on hold, and his plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico .\nIt’s unclear as of now how big the impact will be, but so far some of the images are POWERFUL.\nProud to stand with local restaurants and fellow immigrants in solidarity.

What’s happening?’ So I decided to join them and support them — that’s what we’re doing.”\nFrom The Austin American Statesman: Businesses across America are closing Thursday in protest as part of 'A Day Without Immigrants.'
