Do you think our country’s so innocent?” Bill O’Reilly: “Putin’s a killer” \nTrump: \"What do you think — our country’s so innocent?” pic.twitter.com/Ot38ezbf54 \n— BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) February 5, 2017 \nO’Reilly didn’t say who he thought Putin killed, though the Russian leader is a former KGB agent, head of the FSB and is thought to be behind the assassinations of several people , including a number of reporters who challenged the Kremlin. And last year, a British investigation into the 2006 death of Alexander Litvinenko, an ex-Russian spy, found that his murder was “ probably approved ” by Putin. \nOf that charge, Trump had this to say: “First of all, he says he didn’t do it. Many people say it wasn’t him. So who knows who did it?” \nPutin and his administration have consistently rejected the accusations against him, arguing they are politically motivated and untrue. \nTrump’s views on Putin were criticized throughout the presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies accused the Kremlin of being behind hacks into the Democratic National Committee and the emails of John Podesta, the campaign chair to former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \nIn early January, Trump finally said “I think it was Russia” behind the hacks, though he added it’s “not just Russia” that is responsible. He accused the DNC of not taking proper precautions to prevent such cyberattacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:50:25.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
