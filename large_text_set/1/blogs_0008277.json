Nothing has worked. It doesn't come easy to any mother to give their child drugs. None of these have evidence.

He can get aggressive so we have to be careful because other children don't understand it.\" \nIn Amsterdam and America, treatment with cannabis is having huge impact on children suffering with the disorder, with many reporting incredible results after a short period of time. \nHowever, the treatment is illegal here in the UK, and incredible expensive to purchase online. She broke down in tears (Photo: ITV) He's not able to attend school (Photo: ITV) \nHannah explained: \"Medical cannabis is illegal in this country. It's quite controversial, and the laws need to be looked at.\" \n\"We have tried to discuss it. I feel the conversation should be had. I've been in contact with many people who are seeing amazing results, and a huge reduction in seizures,\" she said.

It's not right that it's allowed to happen.\" \n\"We're desperate to give him the life he deserves,\" she added. poll loading Should the government legalise cannabis for medical purposes? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T15:03:19.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
