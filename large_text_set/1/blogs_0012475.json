But when she's at home in rural British Columbia, the actress thrives on wellness habits that calm her mind and strengthen her body. Here's what a typical day looks like. Courtesy of Sarah Wayne Callies \nUp and at 'em! Callies begins her day between 7 and 8 a.m. in her chicken coop, where she’s raised Rhode Island Reds for five years. “I wanted to feel connected to what I eat,” says the star. “I give them yesterday’s scraps; they give me today’s eggs for breakfast.” She tops two from the morning’s haul with salsa or soy sauce.

An avid cook, she turns her seasonal picks into dishes such as quinoa with sun-dried tomatoes, arugula and pesto. Traveling often serves as her inspiration: “I’ve worked in lots of different countries, so I’ve accumulated recipes from all over.” Courtesy of Sarah Wayne Callies You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:19:58.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
