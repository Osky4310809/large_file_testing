Instead, he made us fall for him with his curly hair and tall body in his debut film, Barsaat . Bobby Deol has proved his versatility as an actor in many films but, sadly, couldn't sustain his filmy career for long. Even if he has been away from the limelight for a long time, we cannot deny that Bobby was definitely a main contender in our 90's crush list. On his 48th birthday, let's have a look at all the milestones set by this blue-eyed boy.Don't you remember his amazing curly hair? \nOr his eyes, that spoke louder than words. \nWe all wanted a boyfriend like him who could dance like a hottie on the peppy number, Duniya Haseeno Ka Mela ! \nRemember, his slow-walk in the movie Soldier ? #Breathtaking \nHow can we miss those cute dimples? \nHis dapper style in Humraaz was killer too. \nTime for him to take on Bollywood, again!
