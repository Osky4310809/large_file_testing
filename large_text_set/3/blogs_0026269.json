EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IN ONE PLACE! \nOverview of Monitor Monitor FAQs (Click to show) \nThese are purchased on eBay. All sellers are reputable (we have not had one flake on delivery - at least this has not been posted here to date 3/31/12.) Search for Yamakasi Catleap - you'll find plenty. Variants of these monitors are all ~$400 2560x1440, 27\" IPS monitors sold in Korea, not the US. They retail for ~$250 in S. Korea. In other words, they're $700-$1000 monitors for 1/2 the price. All older (READ: those shipped in February 2012 - 2B models) Catleap monitors seem to hit 85hz+ ( 97hz 100hz+ being the highest so far, which is the GPU's limit at this resolution). Newer Catleaps seem to have a top OC limit of 65-67hz. Very few people have received OC-ready Catleaps in March 2012. A PCB swap is possible to make newer Catleaps OC up to 97h 120hz with the proper GPU (READ: nVidia 680.) We have not sourced these PCBs at this time (3/20/02), but have several leads. See post 1002 for pics of a successful swap. No 240V/120V step down transformer or EU adapter needed. All you need is a generic PSU cable. It's a glossy display, no AG coating Inputs will vary depending on the model you purchased. Dual DVI, audio, power, and HDMI are the only inputs (most will have power/DVI only.) It's an 8 bit display. There are \"10 bit\" variants out there on Ebay. From what I understand, it's not a true 10 bit panel anyway. Useful info about 8 vs 10 bit color , thank you SJetski71 No OSD (on this basic \"Lite\" model), just LED backlight brightness (and volume as applicable). It has an LG IPS LCD panel, the same one found in 27\" iMacs. The Dell u2711 uses the LM270WQ2, these use the LM270WQ1. Squaretrade reps say that they'll cover this monitor, but we won't really know until someone tries to send in a monitor under warranty. Yes, it's fine for gaming. Due to the lack of any extra inputs input lag is on par with a 720p TV. It's 60hz default, not 97hz or 120hz. You can OC some variant of these monitors - see the section on OCing below (newer models speed limited to 65-67hz - for now.) Monitor has a VESA mount (3\" square). Most buyers will not have to pay import taxes as that is handled by the seller. People have complained about non-functioning tracking numbers. I have not had an issue and I have purchased two of these. Make sure you use the link to EMS below (assuming your seller shipped EMS.) You can remove the back silver arc, stand, bezel very easily. There is a UK variant of the monitor, the Hazro HZ27WC, but it's significantly more expensive. As the manual and any OSD will be in Korean, the Hazro manual may be helpful. There may be a valid manufacturer's warranty, but it requires you to ship the monitor back to Korea (roughly $130 shipping.) Some sellers have started offering 14 day returns (same deal with shipping costs though.) The stand does tilt back and is pretty wobbly. Some sellers ship the monitor wrapped in bubble wrap - ask and we can let you know those that do (the extra protection cannot hurt.) Some ship FedEx others EMS. EMS, once it enters the US, is delivered by the United States Postal Service. There are more models, similar to Catleap out there, review this thread (have fun!) to see more - CLICKY Will your video card be able to push one, two, three or more Catleaps? I don't know - check the card's manufacturer page and read up on the specs - then you will know. Thanks to brucethemoose for compiling much of this information. \n5 models of the Q270 - Click Each to Visit Manufacturer's Website \nMonitor specs are identical for each model (inputs, glass, speakers are the only differences. Multi-input is the only one with an OSD.) \nThe bezel on all models is 1\" top, left, and right with 1 1/2\" for the bottom. \n\nAustralia/NZ : from evangelionstar \nI am from Australia but also familiar with New Zealand's limits too. There is no tax or duties payable in Australia for an item via post or courier so long as the total cost is below $1000. Its very straight forward. Value under $1000 and your all set. For Nz its around $400 or so (from memory). Basically if the charges of Duty + GST is less than $60NZD then nothing is payable. \n\nCanada : from keveinsbane \nIn Canada, there is no Customs or duties for complete LCD colour monitors. There is no tax on \"gifts\" valued at <$60, and no tax on any items < $20 value. Tax in Canada varies depending on your province. My monitor was marked as a $30 value, and I paid no taxes or duties on my purchase. \n\nEstonia : from skypc \nOrdered Catleap to Estonia from Green-sum. Green-sum stated on invoice the worth of te monitor as 30$ and the shipping price was about 110$. Tax was calculated from worth stated on invoice + shipping price and I had to pay 25% from this sum, $140. \n\nSo I'm from France and I paid for a 311€ ($406) monitor : customs duty : 43 € So here is what happened : - the parcel got stuck in customs, reason : no invoice - 1 week after I received a letter from the customs. They asked for an invoice and the paypal receipt - I asked dreamseller for the invoice, he said that he could make one with the value I wanted, but I didn't want to fake the paypal receipt so I declared the real price. What I just did for a new order (dreamseller) : - I asked him to join an invoice with a credible value in the parcel ($200), so that the parcel can go trough customs without them contacting me. - with this, VAT should be lower, but I don't know about the other two taxes, I'll see. \n\nNo customs or import fees to Japan \n\nCustom fees with green sum : 35.81 euro. Custom fees with samsungDC or something; 43,41 Sweden : from slaktfarfar After my Catleap got stuck in customs i had to pay 25% of what i paid for the screen ($394) which was $98. I bought mine from Green-sum. And i know another one ordering from green-sum also had to pay taxes. But another guy ordering from dcsamsungmall didnt have to. green-sum used EMS and dcsamsungmall used fedex maybe thats was because. U.K. : From whybother Marked at £30 the customs fee will simply be VAT or £6. The shipping company also charges a fee tho. Monitors imported to the UK: Value <£135 = 20% Value >£135 = 14% (Duty) + 20% of Value + Duty Plus shipping company fee. If the monitor was marked with a value of £250 and shipped via Royal Mail, your total customs fee would be £100. Gotta love this country... If marked as a gift and less than £36 there should be no customs charge tho. Where to Track Your Monitor (Click to show) \nShipping EMS : CLICK HERE - You will receive two dialog boxes BEFORE you see the tracking screen and two AFTER you enter your number. Just hit \"CANCEL\" for all four (I don't read Korean so I have no idea what we would be saying \"OK\" to!) \n\nEMS Tracking looks like this. \n\nPosting office zip code : 614013 \nDestination country : U.S.A Arrival at outward office of exchange INTERNATIONAL POST OFFICE Departure from outward office of exchange INTERNATIONAL POST OFFICE Handed over to Air carrier INCHEON \nFlight date : 16:40 Thu 08 Mar 2012 (KST) \nFlight number : OZ214 \nHowever, you can track through USPS - it looks like this: \nOrigin Post is Preparing Shipment March 08, 2012, 2:58 pm ISC SAN FRANCISCO (USPS) March 08, 2012, 7:54 am SEOUL, KOREA March 07, 2012, 7:11 pm KOREA \n\n\nOther Shipping? I don't have any experience with that and if you have your monitor shipped via a service other than EMS, please let the OP know so this can be updated. \nSpeaker Cable (if purchased that model) HDMI Cable (same) The Power Cable - Cabling Issues - Power Bricks (Click to show) \nPower Cable : These monitors come with a power brick (like you use with a laptop) and a funky European/Asian market power cable as pictured below. You DO NOT need a special power cable for the power brick. Any three-prong power cable, from a PSU, Monitor, etc., will work just fine. \n\nCable That Comes With Monitor \n\n\n\nREPLACEMENT POWER BRICKS : from mango45 - For those that need replacement AC adapters, they can be found by searching eBay for EFL-2202W Adapter . This adapter appears to have the correct specifications - 110-240V input and 24V 5A output - and the tip has the same pinout: + on pins 1 and 3 and - on pins 2 and 4. \n\nDVI Cables : Remember, these monitors are DUAL DVI so if you have an older (read: non-dual DVI) cable your monitor will display some interesting things. See the pic below for the proper and improper cables. \n\nBad Cable \n\nHere is a link to an eBay page that sells power brick that have been reported to work cooler than stockers. Some have reported bricks dying from the word go, try these if you aren't getting the proper voltage out of yours. CLICKY These are seriously pricey at the moment (3/20/12) try searching around for others, but this is the type you need. Stand Removal (Click to show) \nFirst, remove the 8 screws around the outside of the monitor (not shown - pretty obvious.) Next, you need to find a location that is separating easily - mine was right next to the power, brightness, volume buttons. While separating the two bezels gently pry the pieces apart with a flat blade screw driver. Don't be rough! As long as you are applying enough pressure on the bezel with your hand the screw driver will easily pop the little clips. Continue around the bezel the same way - separate and pop. You will notice that it is best to pry the bezel apart at the very point where the two pieces do not want to separate easily - this is a tab. \nThe trick to not harming your bezel is this - the front bezel has a bit of a lip so that when you insert your flat blade you want the blade against the back of the monitor. If you are then you won't deform the soft plastic of the front bezel. Once you have the outside bezel removed, turn the monitor over and you will see 4 silver screws around the outside corners. Remove these. Once you have the 4 screws removed tilt the screen up and you will find it plugged in at 3 locations. Simply unclip each one and the monitor is free from the housing. The top two clips require you to press the edges of the clip inward for them to be removed. The bottom one (white cabling) is like a PSU tab - lift and the lines will separate. With the monitor out this is what you see. The four boxes are the screws you need to cleanly remove the silver arc piece. I didn't! See below. Here are the top screws for the silver arc. Here is the bottom of the back panel and the mount for the stand. Remove the red box screws to release the silver arc. The green box screws hold the stand in place. Here is the bottom connector for the silver arc - see how these pieces are broken? I thought you could simply pull the arc off - ummm, no, you can't. Here is a shot of one side of the stand mount. You could remove the two nuts holding the stand to the swivel mount if you want. These are 10mm nuts. I was going to go this route but found it really tight in there to get a 10mm anything to get the nut free so I just removed the whole bracket (saves a few ounces in weight!) Remove these screws - and two not pictured - to release the stand bracket. Here is the back with the stand bracket removed. Re-insert screws here for the panel hold down. Here is the stand and bracket removed as one piece. As you can see it is held in place with a total of 6 screws. The Catleap uses a 75mm (3\") VESA mounting solution. Here are some pics of my wall mount solution - look China and South Korea working together to bring me awesome video! This is an up close of my wall mount and the power brick mounted to the wall with velcro. Finally, some shots with the monitor mounted - both off and on. Enjoy! \nGet monitor test program from here - CLICKY Quickie install procedure (Windows 7 - not sure about others). Go to Display, Screen Resolution. Select your monitor and click \" Advanced Settings \" Select \" Color Management \" tab Click \" Use my settings for this device \" check box Click \" Add \" under the \"Profiles associated with this device\" box. Select \" Browse \" and select the color profiles you want to add - I added all three Toasty made so I could decide which one I liked. With more than one profile in the box - simply click \" Set as Default Profile \" to make that one default. Cheers! Again, a huge thank you to Toasty for these! \nThat will set the color profile to use in color managed programs, but that won't load the profile's gamma correction. You also have to go to the Advanced tab and enable the \"Use Windows display calibration\" option. The option is grayed out in the initial screen, so you have to click \"Change system defaults...\" and go to the Advanced tab there to enable it. However, that uses Windows's LUT loader, which only supports 8-bit values, so gradients will have some banding. I have an alternate method of loading the gamma correction using a third-party LUT loader. This takes advantage of the 10-bit LUT + dithering that AMD/ATI cards have, so gradients stay smooth. I'd like to know if there are any NVIDIA cards where you can use the LUT loader and still have smooth gradients. \n\nHERE IS THE ZIP FILE FOR ALL THREE TOASTYX COLOR PROFILES - SEE THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN - CLICKY \nI created a zip that includes the LUT loader from Argyll CMS along with the native and d65 color profiles: catleap-profiles.zip 1. Copy the \"Color Profiles\" folder to C:\\ (if you want it somewhere else, you'll have to edit the \"Load catleap\" shortcuts) 2. Double-click one of the \"Load catleap\" shortcuts to load the corresponding profile. 3. Copy the shortcut you want to use to the Startup folder in the start menu if you want it to load automatically on boot. 4. If you want color management, you still have to go through the steps mentioned above to set the correct profile, but don't enable the \"Use Windows display calibration\" option if you're using this method. You can use this image to test if gradients are smooth: \n\nAdditional information from ToastyX \nMeasurements and color information for the catleap: The brightness ranges from 25 cd/m² to 315 cd/m². There are 30 levels of brightness, and each button press averages around 10 cd/m². Native contrast is around 1025:1 in the middle of the screen. Calibration will bring that down to around 875:1 or higher, depending on the white point. Native gamma is actually pretty close to 2.2 out of the box. The native white point is too green, and the brightest white has a different hue from the rest of the grayscale. This is not unusual for LG IPS panels, but most IPS monitors with color controls have the default contrast set one or two notches below the brightest white to avoid this. Since this monitor has no color controls, it just shows the panel's native output. In my experience, the white point being too green is also common with LG IPS panels, but this can vary from panel to panel. These are the main reasons why it looks \"off\" to me out of the box. With calibration, it looks great. Several points I should add, colorimeters are not totally accurate with white point measurements, and measurements can drift with age, so results can vary from unit to unit and between different colorimeters. The results can also vary on different parts of the screen since most monitors are not perfectly uniform. My particular panel is slightly redder at the top edge and slightly yellower at the bottom edge, but most of the middle is consistent. Colorimeters also need different filters for different backlights (especially for wider gamuts), so that also affects accuracy. This monitor's gamut is close to sRGB, so that's not a major problem. I have three colorimeters: Retail Eye-One Display 2 (oldest) SpectraView-branded Eye-One Display 2 ColorEyes-branded XRite DTP94B The SpectraView Eye-One Display 2 was unusable on this monitor. I don't know if this colorimeter is failing or if it just has different filters for wider gamut monitors, but it wanted to add way too much red. The retail Eye-One Display 2 and the DTP94B were pretty close to each other. Both removed a lot of green along with some red, with the DTP94 leaving slightly more green. I always preferred the Eye-One Display 2 over the DTP94B because the DTP94B always left a little more green than I liked. The retail Eye-One's result looks more natural to me, but I have no way of knowing for sure which one is more accurate without a spectrophotometer. Another problem I should mention is the Eye-One Display 2's brightness measurement drifts downwards when it gets warmer. The DTP94B doesn't have that problem, so I did the brightness measurements with the DTP94B. Black point measurements are also hard for colorimeters, so it's hard to get exact contrast values. The DTP94 only reports to two decimal places. I don't usually like to post color profiles since colors can vary from unit to unit, but since this monitor benefits greatly from white point calibration and the gamma doesn't change much, I will include three profiles here (all gamma 2.2): catleap-6500k.icm - This is the one produced by the retail Eye-One Display 2. Contrast is around 875:1. catleap-d65.icm - This is the one produced by the DTP94. This one has slightly more green. Contrast is around 900:1. *** Edit: I just noticed the Eye-One's profile makes blues purplish in color-managed programs, so the DTP94 (D65) profile is probably the better one to use. *** To get 115-120 cd/m² with those profiles, use 10 button presses up from the lowest brightness. catleap-native.icm - This one keeps the native white point while adjusting the rest of the grayscale to match. Since the white point can vary from unit to unit, use this if the other two profiles look strange to you. This one preserves the native contrast ratio. To get 115 cd/m² with this profile, use 8 button presses up from the lowest brightness. I also need to write up how to load these profiles. ATI/AMD GPUs are capable of displaying 8-bit color from a 10-bit LUT with dithering just like professional LCD monitors do, which allows you to calibrate without getting banding, but you'll need a third-party LUT loader because the LUT loader in Windows only supports 8-bit values. I don't know of a way to enable dithering with NVIDIA cards in Windows, so NVIDIA users will get some banding when using a color profile. Mac OS X enables dithering for both ATI/AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, so gradients should always be smooth there. That leaves me with a conundrum: ATI/AMD: no banding with calibration, but can only get 85 Hz NVIDIA: banding with calibration, but can get 100 Hz I wish there was some way to get one or the other to do both. How to OC with nVidia (Click to show) \nDOWNLOAD 1) Download the latest version of Powerstrip (I'm...unsure how this actually helps with the refresh rate. I don't believe it does. But I like Powerstrip's override feature, and this will also allow you to easily remove that green tint off your monitor, if you haven't already done so. And always a handy app to have) DOWNLOAD 2) Download This Bad Boy too. dseo13b.zip 631k .zip file DOWNLOAD 3) Download the Monitor driver next. Catleap_Q270_OC.zip 1k .zip file This driver should be good to use by anyone. It registers the monitor as having upto 123hz refresh rate. However, remember that while the driver lets the system think your monitor can run a higher refresh rate, it doesn't mean your card can handle it. So just because the option might be there, doesn't mean it's safe to do. Know your systems limitations and proceed at your own risk! Steps to follow: 1) Install Powerstrip. Just because I said so. To remove the green tint, if you haven't already, and go to configure colour profiles: Click the green button, and adjust the sliders to remove the tint. For my monitor, the settings below worked perfectly. Each monitor is going to be different though. So play around until it looks right. Or just use a proper calibration software: Or you can skip that step alltogether. 2) Open up dseo13b.exe (inside dseo13b.zip, attached above) It sometimes opens up behind any existing open windows. So you won't see it until you individually minimize other stuff. Hit Next. Yes if you agree to the terms. Select \"Enable Test Mode\" and hit Next. Restart your computer. You'll notice in the bottom-right corner of your desktop it'll now say your Windows is in Test Mode. I should probably point out that this guide was made on Windows 7 and I have no idea about compatibility with other versions of Windows because...I'm not the manufacturer of the monitor and don't care to cross test. 3) Hit the Windows Key + R to bring up the the Run prompt. Type in devmgmt.msc and hit enter. Under Monitors, select your monitor (Dual DVI, or Plug And Play Monitor, or whatever it's called). Right click, and select \"Update Driver Software:\" Select \"Browse my computer for driver software,\" then \"Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer,\" followed by clicking \"Have Disk...\" Now browse to the folder you saved the monitor driver in (driver was at the top of the post. make sure you unzip it first): Once you've done that, it should now show the drivers it found in that folder. Select the Overclock.Net monitor from the list, obviously, in case you have multiple drivers that it's located and you should see: Click Next, and once it's installed the driver, you must restart your computer. 4) Once you restart your computer, open up the Nvidia control panel, go to Change Resolution, click Customize, then Create Custom Resolution, as shown here: Once you're there, you want to make either 1 or 2 profiles, depending on whether you're playing with a single card, which card you have, and whether you want to SLI. For many people, the 100hz will be all they can do. Meaning...all pre-gtx 680 cards may be limited to 100hz. All gtx 680 sli setups are limited to 100hz. If you're in that category, please ONLY do the 100hz one. Enter the details as below: Now if you have a single gtx 680 card, or some other card that is known to allow a higher than 400 pixel clock, then you can set up 120hz in pretty much exactly the same way, just with the refresh rate changed from 100hz to 120hz: Please make sure to enter the details on the bottom half of the screen in Manual mode as shown below, otherwise for 100hz SLI or non-gtx 680 single card setups it'll push your pixel clock above 400 and may cause a lot of problem or simply just not work. And for single gtx 680 owners...still better to run the pixel clock as low as possible. So do it. 5) To confirm that the system now reads your refresh rate capabilities properly, go to Powerstrip --> Display Profiles --> Configure, and click on \"Hide modes not supported by this monitor.\" If done properly, the slider on the right of the screen should still slide on over to 100hz or 120hz, depending on what resolutions you set up in Nvidia's control panel. You can also confirm what actual refresh rate you have active now, by double clicking the camera icon next to the slider. If the slider is inactive for you, make sure to select \" Standard Discrete Timing\" from the drop down menu on that same page instead of \"Windows Default.\" Here's a screenshot showing everything, and also my tested refresh rate at 120.003hz: 6) Enable Vsync and test out a game. \nHow to OC with AMD cards (Click to show) \nHow to run your monitor at a higher refresh rate, particularly if you have an AMD/ATI card. The program someone over at hardforum made is the easiest way to do it, though other more effective ways are being investigated.
