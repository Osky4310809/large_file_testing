During an interview last Friday on The View , Lahren announced that she’s pro-choice--citing limited government as her reasoning. “I'm pro-choice, and here's why. I am a constitutional, you know, someone that loves the Constitution. I'm someone that's for limited government. So I can't sit here and be a hypocrite and say I'm for limited government, but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies,” she said.\nShe added: “I'm for limited government, so stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well.”\nShortly after her comments, Beck fired back. On Monday, he addressed Lahren’s words on his radio show, according to the New York Post . \"I would disagree that you're a hypocrite if you want limited government and yet you want the government to protect life of the unborn,\" Beck said. The managing editor of The Blaze, Leon Wolf, also told CNN that Lahren’s show would be off-air for one week.\nSince the backlash, Lahren tweeted that she has “moderate, conservative, and libertarian views,” and will “never apologize to anyone for being an independent thinker.”\nI have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views. I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker.\n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 18, 2017 \n\nFortun e has reached out to The Blaze for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:10:13.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
