Adama Barrow \nShe has become a controversial figure in recent weeks after telling The Guardian newspaper that Jammeh would be prosecuted for crimes committed by his regime, an act almost immediately followed by the mercurial president announcing he no longer recognised the election result. \nA development expert who previously worked of the United Nations, Jallow-Tambajang has also argued that a national commission for asset recovery should be established. \nThis would be particularly pertinent given claims by Barrow’s team that Jammeh stole $11 million and several luxury vehicles before departing for Equatorial Guinea. \nJammeh also had a female vice-president, Isatou Njie-Saidy, who stayed loyal to him for several years in an administration where defections and unexplained firings were common.
