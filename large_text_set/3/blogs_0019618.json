The court had passed the order on March 17 and the state government had sought a stay on it. \nAccording to reports, the Mamata Banerjee government also tendered an unconditional apology before the court. West Bengal government lawyer was made to apologise for calling the Calcutta High Court biased in the state’s appeal against a CBI probe. \nEarlier, on Monday, CBI had submitted its preliminary compliance report on the case. According to the sources, if enough evidence is found in the initial investigation, an FIR will be registered and raids will be conducted at premises of those involved. \nFurther details are awaited.   © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:37:21.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
