administration of trying to undermine President-elect Donald Trump by spreading fake allegations and said those who are doing it are \"worse than prostitutes.\"\nThe statement reflected the Kremlin's boiling anger at President Barack Obama 's administration, which declined to comment on Putin's accusation.\nAsked about an unsubstantiated dossier outlining unverified claims that Trump engaged in sexual activities with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel, Putin dismissed it as \"fake\" and \"nonsense\" and said it was part of efforts by Obama's administration to \"undermine the legitimacy of the president-elect\" despite his \"convincing\" victory.\nTrump earlier rejected the sexual allegations as \"fake news\" and \"phony stuff.\"\nPutin's broadside at the White House reveals a culmination of tensions between Moscow and Washington, which have built up over the Ukrainian crisis, the Syrian war and the allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election.\nMore national politics coverage Open link \"People who order such fakes against the U.S. president-elect, fabricate them and use them in political struggle are worse than prostitutes,\" Putin said. \"They have no moral restrictions whatsoever, and it highlights a significant degree of degradation of political elites in the West, including in the United States.\"\nHe spoke in Moscow during a news conference following talks with the president of Moldova.\nThe Russian leader ridiculed the authors of the Trump dossier for alleging that Russian spy agencies were collecting compromising material on Trump when he visited Moscow in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant.\n\"He wasn't a politician, we didn't even know about his political ambitions,\" Putin said. \"Do they think that our special services are hunting for every U.S. billionaire?\"\nPutin also sarcastically suggested that Trump, who met the world's most beautiful women at the pageant, had a better choice for female companionship than Moscow prostitutes, even though Putin claimed \"they are also the best in the world.\"\nOutgoing CIA chief rips into Trump on Russia threat Tribune news services The outgoing CIA director charged on Sunday that Donald Trump lacks a full understanding of the threat Moscow poses to the United States, delivering a public lecture to the president-elect that further highlighted the bitter state of Trump's relations with American intelligence agencies.\nJohn Brennan's...\nThe outgoing CIA director charged on Sunday that Donald Trump lacks a full understanding of the threat Moscow poses to the United States, delivering a public lecture to the president-elect that further highlighted the bitter state of Trump's relations with American intelligence agencies.\nJohn Brennan's...\n(Tribune news services) He said Trump's foes are ready to go as far as to \"stage a Maidan in Washington to prevent Trump from entering office,\" in reference to the alleged U.S. role in organizing protests in the main square of the Ukrainian capital, the Maidan, which forced the nation's Russia-friendly president from power in 2014.\n\"People who are doing that are inflicting a colossal damage to the interests of the United States,\" Putin said.\nPutin also charged that those spreading allegations against Trump want to \"bind the president-elect hand and foot to prevent him from fulfilling his election promises.\"\n\"How can you do anything to improve U.S.-Russian relations when they launch such canards as hackers' interference in the election?\" he said.\nPutin voiced hope that \"common sense will prevail\" and Russia and the United States will be able to normalize their relations once Trump takes office Friday.\nHe said he doesn't know Trump and has no interests in defending him.\nTrump calls hacking probe 'witch hunt,' then calls intelligence briefing ‘constructive’ David Nakamura As U.S. intelligence officials have raised increasing alarm this week over Russia's meddling in the presidential election,

officials have raised increasing alarm this week over Russia's meddling in the presidential election, Donald Trump has sought to recast the investigation as a matter of old-fashioned politics rather than national security.\nThe president-elect has reacted to mounting pressure...\n(David Nakamura) \"I don't know Mr. Trump. I have never met him and I don't know what he will do on the international arena,\" Putin said. \"I have no reason whatsoever to assail him, criticize him for something, or defend him.\"\nAt a separate news conference Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow hopes for better relations with the United States based on respect for mutual interests once Trump takes office, in contrast with the \"messianic\" approach of the outgoing U.S. administration that he said has ravaged ties.\nLavrov said Russia and the United States can reach common ground on nuclear arms control and other issues if each country proceeds from its national interests and shows respect for the other side.\nHe voiced hope that Trump's team will consist of pragmatic people \"who will not engage in moralizing and will try to understand the interests of their partners just as they clearly uphold their own interests.\"\nLavrov denounced the foreign policies of the outgoing Obama administration and its allies as \"messianic\" attempts to enforce Western values on the rest of the world, which has led to instability and conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere.\nEuropean allies to Donald Trump: Putin does not want to make America great again Josh Rogin The prospect of President-elect Donald Trump striking a grand bargain with Russian President Vladimir Putin is unnerving to many traditional U.S. allies, but few stand to lose more than the pro-American leaders of countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

Those leaders, fighting on the front line...\n(Josh Rogin) Lavrov said Moscow is inviting representatives of the incoming U.S. administration to attend talks Monday on Syria in Kazakhstan, discussions brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran. He voiced hope that Russian and U.S. experts could start discussions on fighting terrorism in Syria during that meeting.\nAsked to comment on Trump's recent comments in which he indicated he could end sanctions imposed on Russia in the aftermath of its 2014 annexation of Crimea in return for a nuclear arms reduction deal, Lavrov said Russia was ready to sit down for nuclear arms talks with the U.S.\nLavrov noted he didn't see Trump's words as an offer to cut arms in exchange for canceling the sanctions, rather as an expression of readiness to look at reviewing the sanctions while engaging in negotiations on arms control, among other issues.\nLavrov added that, along with nuclear arsenals, the agenda for such negotiations should include new hypersonic weapons, missile defense, the weaponization of space and other issues.\nLike Putin, Lavrov rejected allegations of Russian meddling into the U.S. election as \"absurdities\" and \"fakes\" intended to hurt Trump.\nCIA Director Brennan: Give Trump 'benefit of the doubt' Kim Janssen President-elect Donald Trump has been zinging the U.S. intelligence community for weeks about its finding that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. elections — and causing concern by opening his own channel to Taiwan without seeking their advice.\nBut CIA Director John Brennan said on the eve...\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has been zinging the U.S. intelligence community for weeks about its finding that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. elections — and causing concern by opening his own channel to Taiwan without seeking their advice.\nBut CIA Director John Brennan said on the eve...\n(Kim Janssen) He said U.S. intelligence agencies have failed to produce any evidence to back those claims, adding that officials who engaged in the effort \"deserve to be fired, as they receive their salaries for nothing.\"\nLavrov described the allegations of Russian election meddling in the U.S. vote as the final \"spasms of those who realize that their time is coming to an end.\"\n\"The time of foreign policy demagogues is over, and, feeling hurt, they fabricate all kinds of fakes,\" he said. \"First, officials leak fakes to the media, then media start spinning them and, finally, officials comment on them as facts.\"\nLavrov also denounced a dossier on Trump compiled by a former British spy as a \"rude provocation,\" contemptuously referring to its author as a \"runaway swindler from MI6\" without citing his name.\nIn a reflection of the bad blood between Obama's administration and the Kremlin, Lavrov accused U.S. officials of making repeated attempts to recruit Russian diplomats in the United States as spies, including a deputy chief of mission. He called the attempts \"cynical\" and \"unprecedented.\"\nAssociated Press\n Europe Russia Donald Trump Vladimir Putin Sergey Lavrov Barack Obama", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-587bad46/turbine/ct-cia-director-brennan-trump-tweets-russia-20170115", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58750dc7/turbine/ct-trump-putin-europe-20170110", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-582c9aba/turbine/ct-full-coverage-2016-presidential-election-20160829", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-586ef35b/turbine/ct-cia-director-brennan-axelrod-0106-chicago-inc-20170105", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-587e3a46/turbine/ct-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-russia-20170117", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-586f8a71/turbine/ct-russia-election-hacking-report-trump-20170106"], "published": "2017-01-17T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T20:12:19.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
