(Photo by Bob Levey/Getty Images) \nBOSTON (CBS) – According to a national survey by Public Policy Polling , 53-percent of Americans will be rooting for the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, even though I bet 98-percent of them couldn’t name a single Falcon. \nJust 27-percent want the Patriots to win. Only 19-percent of those polled have a negative view of the Falcons; more than double that, 42-percent, view the Pats negatively. \nNo surprise here. \nWhen you are a sports dynasty over a long period of time, all the losers build up a good head of hate. It happened to the Celtics and the Yankees too. \nBack in the NFL, even though they haven’t won a Super Bowl in 22 years, residual resentment of the once-dominant Dallas Cowboys is strong enough to put them in a virtual tie with the Pats for most-hated team, 21-to-19 percent. \nAnd you know what? I understand the Pats hatred – as long as it’s based on envy and frustration with their consistent success. \nIt’s human nature to resent the winners when you’re always the loser; we Red Sox fans get that. \nBut I have no use for the fans out there who hate the Pats because of you-know-what-Gate and the myth, endlessly perpetuated by single-digit IQ sports-talk hosts and ESPN analysts, that the Pats are somehow more ethically challenged than other NFL teams. \nYes, the Patriots have made mistakes – Coach Bill Belichick has acknowledged he ignored a league rule about where a camera could be located to tape game action. You-know-what-Gate, however, was a total crock. \nI would challenge anyone to prove, using real facts, that the Pats are one iota less honest than any other team. \nSo let the haters hate. \nI prefer to kick back and enjoy it as the winners continue to win. \nListen to Jon’s commentary: Jon Keller Follow Follow Jon on Twitter E-Mail Jon Keller Jon Keller is WBZ-TV News' Political Analyst, and his \"Keller At Large\" reports on a wide range of topics are regularly featured during WBZ-TV News at 6PM and 11PM.
