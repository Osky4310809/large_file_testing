The No. 7 overall pick of the 2015 draft, White has played in four games in two seasons and was not impressive in those limited snaps. A healthy offseason would be a step in the right direction, but White has a lot to prove in his third season. With Alshon Jeffery likely on the way out, White will compete with Cameron Meredith for the No. 1 role. Jan 2 - 12:25 PM Source: Adam Jahns on Twitter Bears WR Kevin White (leg, injured reserve) will not return this season. The No. 7 overall pick of the 2015 draft, White will head into 2017 with four games of big-league experience, and two major leg injuries on his résumé. He was an exceptionally-raw player when on the field this season. White turns 25 in June. 2017 is make or break for the bust in the making. Mon, Nov 21, 2016 03:00:00 PM Source: Brad Biggs on Twitter Bears GM Ryan Pace said he is \"eyeballing\" Week 13 for Kevin White's (leg, injured reserve) return. Week 13 is the first week he is eligible. White underwent surgery after suffering a spiral fracture of his fibula in Week 4. Considering White's history and the Bears' penchant for lying about injuries, this timetable seems awfully optimistic. Even if he is able to return Week 13, White will be tough to trust his first week back. There are better ways to spend a roster spot in standard leagues. Tue, Oct 18, 2016 10:21:00 AM Source: Adam Hoge on Twitter Kevin White (leg, injured reserve) is expected to undergo surgery \"in the very near future.\" White landed on injured reserve with a severe high-ankle sprain which resulted in a spiral fracture of his fibula. The Bears still hope White will return this year, but surgery certainly puts that in question. Even if he is able to come back, White is not eligible to return until Week 13. He can be dropped in all redraft leagues. Cameron Meredith went for 130 yards and a touchdown in White's absence and is an excellent add in all leagues.
