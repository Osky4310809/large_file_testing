And Rooney believes that success in management is quite simply a matter of desire. \n\"Players playing in this generation have enough money to not have to go into management. The ones who want to do it will be successful.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:41:11.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
