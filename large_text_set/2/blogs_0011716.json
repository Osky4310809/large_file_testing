Clad in custom Armani Privé, Rihanna looked the most beautiful, gothic, tulip we’ve ever seen. In a bejeweled orange halter top, and a high-waisted black sculptural skirt, the 8-time Grammy nominated artist killed the red carpet game. With a simple smokey eye, nude, glossy lip and plenty of diamonds, Rihanna looked like the glamorous bad girl that we love.\nSteve Granitz/Getty We love how daring this look is, and that the singer chose to accessorize with statement earrings and silhouettes that showed off her tattoos. Steve Granitz/Getty \nHonestly, is there anything that Rihanna can’t pull off? We like to think these colors are off limits except at Halloween, but Rihanna has made us think twice.\nSteve Granitz/Getty And with a barely-there back, Rihanna has the look-back down pat. If only we could look half as fierce as she does and we’d be set.\nChris Jackson/Getty Slay the game, Rihanna!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:04:04.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
