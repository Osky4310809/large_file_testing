The PUNCH learnt that the men, who were attached to the X-Squad, were on a surveillance patrol when the incident happened around 1pm on Sunday. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Olarinde Famous-Cole, who confirmed the incident, said the victims’ vehicle had a collision with an unregistered tipper. He said, “At about 1pm, a police truck, which had five policemen on board in a Nissan frontier van was allegedly hit by a tipper lorry with no registration number. The driver, who cannot be identified as of the time of this report, fled the scene. Both vehicles were coming from opposite direction at a point near Isiwu town when the collision occurred. Three policemen died on the spot. “An Assistant Superintendent of Police and an inspector, who sustained serious injuries were rescued and rushed to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, where the latter died and the former is currently admitted.” He added that the corpses had been deposited in the Ikorodu General Hospital and LASUTH, Ikeja for autopsy, adding that the police patrol truck and the tipper lorry had been towed to the division. Famous-Cole appealed to members of the public to help with information that would assist in the arrest and prosecution of the tipper driver. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
