A specific global launch date has not yet been announced.\nSee also: Best MMORPGs on Android October 24, 2016 The mobile game is an adaptation of the PC MMORPG Lineage 2 that first launched way back in 2003 by NCSoft. Lineage 2 Revolution is actually a direct sequel to the PC game, at least in terms of its storyline, as it takes place 100 years after the events of Lineage II.\nThe mobile game uses Unreal Engine 4 for its graphics and features four different playable races (Human, Elf, Dark Elf and Dwarf) and three classes (Warrior, Rogue and Mage) to choose from. Lineage 2 Revolution is an action-themed MMO, with lots of battles against fantasy creatures and monsters, so itâ€™s sure to appear to a worldwide audience.\nBy the way, this is just the latest move by Asia-based Netmarble to reach a Western audience. In December 2016, it acquired the Vancouver-based studio previously started and owned by Kabam, which developed the popular Marvel Contest of Champions mobile game, and will still release the upcoming Transformers: Forged to Fight game for Android this spring .\nNetmarble now has over 5 million players in South Korea signed up to play the game. It claims it has earned over $170 million during its first month in its native country. We will keep you up to date when the localized versions of Lineage 2 Revolution are ready to go live. In the meantime, are you planning to check out the game when it is released in your country?
