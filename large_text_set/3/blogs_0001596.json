The animated equality segment is adjacently being billed as “Disney’s first gay kiss.” \nA gesture that’s not sitting well with Boosie Badazz. \nIn a deleted Instagram post (saved by VladTV ), Boosie captioned the screenshot of two cartoon male lovers with, “This is why I don’t want my kids watching these fucking cartoon shows smh.” \nThe Louisiana rap legend has been quite vocal about his disdain for homosexuality being displayed on television, especially for his children to witness. In November 2015, he blasted top-rated programs , Love & Hip Hop and Empire for prominently featuring openly gay characters and went the extra mile in a sitdown with Vlad on the subject in July 2016. \n“They trying to make everybody fuckin’ gay,” he proclaimed, as he later made the point he had “nothing against” the gay community. “That’s what I think. They’re putting it on our culture. They’re putting it everywhere. Gay stuff is everywhere. And I think they just trying to do it to make a monetary gain. They’re not doing it for the gays. They’re not really fans of the gays. They’re doing it for monetary gain, man. They trying to make money off these people, man. You got cartoons that have gays. On cartoons. Like these are kids. Let kids make they own decision if they wanna go that way…You’re forcing them to be gay.” \nWatch the controversial Star vs. the Forces of Evil clip down below as well as the Boosie VladTV interview where he railed against “the gay agenda.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
