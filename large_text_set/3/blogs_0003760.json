How many times do I have to tell you? We’re taking our case out there to win because we believe we can win.” \nIt follows a string of disastrous polling numbers for Labour, with the Tories holding on to a 18 point lead. \nMs Derbyshire asked Mr Corbyn about a quote from a Labour MP, who reportedly asked Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell at a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting last night: “Why is a former Tory Prime Minister more effective at attacking a Tory government than a Labour Shadow Chancellor”.

We are attacking this government on issues of health and social care. We’re attacking this government on issues of economic development. Of unemployment, of under-employment. Of zero hours contracts. Of insecurity of work. \n“We’re attacking this government on all these fronts. Because John Major is critical of the government over the European Union - so are we. \n“We have accepted the result of the referendum, but we also want to make sure there is a good, effective, tariff-free arrangement with Europe in the future.” Read More Jeremy Corbyn is a 'disaster' for Labour and should quit as leader, says Professor Stephen Hawking \nAsked if he would welcome William Hague’s idea of scrapping the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and calling for a snap election, he said Labour supported the Act, because it increased “stability in politics”. \nBut he said if there was a proposal to get rid of it “I’m sure we’d consider it.” Read More \nAsked if he’d welcome a snap general election, he said: “I want to see a different government.
