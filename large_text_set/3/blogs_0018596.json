In a later email, the same rep clarified it was indeed a hoax and has nothing to do with West’s team. \nAlthough at this point it appears to be nothing more than a well-plotted prank, if West did release a new project next week, coincidentally it would be his 10th studio album, which would line up with the “PROJECT-10” piece of the puzzle. \nHe is reportedly working on the follow-up to The Life of Pablo in the form of a project called Turbo Grafx 16 . What initially appeared to be just another of Yeezy’s whims gained some traction when Pete Rock seemingly shared a tracklist for the album.
