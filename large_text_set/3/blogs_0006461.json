State attorneys are filing the appropriate paperwork in order to file a motion Wednesday, asking federal courts to issue a temporary restraining order blocking implementation of the law. \n\"To be sure, the new executive order covers fewer people than the old one,\" Neal Katyal, an attorney for Hawaii said. But it \"suffers from the same constitutional and statutory defects.\" \nThe new order was signed on Monday, banning travel from six countries in the Middle East for at least 90 days minus Iraq, which was on the previous order. \nIn February, a federal judge in Washington granted a restraining order which immediately halted President Trump's first immigration executive order. \nUnlike the Continental United States, at nearly 2,500 miles away, the State of Hawaii has never experienced the sting of Islamic terror -- the driving factor behind President Trump's campaign and executive order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:30:56.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
