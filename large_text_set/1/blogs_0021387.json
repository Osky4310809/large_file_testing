Today, the company unveiled its latest phone, the Vertu Constellation, and as usual it looks like it’s going to be made for those of us that purchase $1 million yachts out of our pocket cash.\nSee also: Best dual-SIM Android phones 2 days ago The Constellation will actually be the first dual SIM phone from Vertu, which will allow users to store two phone numbers on one device. The 5.5-inch WQHD AMOLED display will be covered in a sapphire crystal screen. The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow phone will also have a 12MP rear camera that supports up to 1.55 micro pixels, and Dolby Digital Plus-supported sound for its front-facing speakers on the top and bottom.\nInside, you can expect a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, along with 4GB of RAM, 128GB of onboard storage, a microSD card for adding even more storage and a 3220mAh battery. It will support charging via a USB-C port along with wireless charging. If you are concerned about security, the phone will also support secure connections via Silent Circle.\nThe Vertu Constellation will be made in England, right down to its hand-turned screws. The phone is made of anodized aluminium along with a leather back that will come “from a specialist, family-run tannery in Italy.” The phone comes with the option of using the company’s 24-hour concierge service, which is accessible just by pressing on the phone’s ruby side button. You can also buy an optional leather case for the Constellation.\nWhile the phone’s price has yet to be announced, previous Vertu products have cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. In other words, if you have to ask, you probably can’t afford it. However, if for some reason you have the cash on hand, you can go to the company’s website to register your interest in the Vertu Constellation before it comes out sometime in mid-February.\nDo you think these kinds of hand-crafted phones will continue to sell to the super-rich?
