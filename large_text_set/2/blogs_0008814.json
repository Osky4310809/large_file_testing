Dan Hasselman, an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice and an adviser to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, said the tribes will file a broader motion under the National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Water Act and Administrative Process Act. \n“We’re disappointed with today’s ruling denying a temporary restraining order against the Dakota Access Pipeline, but we are not surprised. We know this fight is far from over,” said lead counsel Chase Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.
