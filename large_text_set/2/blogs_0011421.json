Lil Wayne will be at Masquerade Nightclub, while Birdman's hitting up several venues that are mere blocks away ... including the House of Blues.\nOur Cash Money sources say they'll both be showing love for their label, but Wayne's done way too much trash-talking to share a stage with Birdman.\nWayne will hook up with the Hot Boys though -- performing with Mannie Fresh , Turk and Juvenile . We're told Mannie plans to pull double duty, and rendezvous with Birdman too at a different club.\nDrama ... like any family reunion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:44:59.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
