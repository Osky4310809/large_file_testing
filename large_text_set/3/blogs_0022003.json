Get ready for impeachment. — Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) March 21, 2017 \n“If the facts are there, then I think we should move very quickly to do something about it. \n“And if there was collusion, and any support for undermining our democracy, I think the President should be impeached.” \nMs Water’s tweet comes a day after FBI director James Comey confirmed the agency was investigating possible contact between the Trump campaign and Kremlin officials. \nHe and National Security Agency boss Michael Rogers also told the Congressional intelligence hearing they believe Russia meddled in the race leading up to the election by hacking the Democratic National Committee and other political organisations.
