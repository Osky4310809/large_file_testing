LOUIS • When he explained why he intends to go to spring training and win an everyday job, Cardinals infielder Greg Garcia said it’s a matter of hours. \nA player doesn’t have a full-time offseason to settle for a part-time role. \n“It’s something I want to try to be,” Garcia said Sunday before taking the stage at the team’s annual Winter Warm-Up to sign autographs for fans. “I want to try to be an everyday player. I want to try to push myself to see what kind of major-leaguer I can be. Like I said, I feel like I work too hard to not set those goals high.” \nGarcia, 27, spent most of 2016 as the Cardinals’ utility infielder, and in 99 games (50 starts) he landed 257 plate appearances. He hit .276/.393/.369 overall, but locked within that slash line was where he really excelled – as a pinch hitter. Garcia was a driving force behind the Cardinals’ pinch-hit success even though he only contributed one of the MLB-record pinch-hit homers. Garcia batted .348 with a .444 on-base percentage and slugged .522 in 23 pinch-hit at-bats. He walked three times and struck out five times in those spots. \nHe was the team’s most consistent, if not thunder-packed pinch hitter. \nThat came from work he did and conversations he had with hitting coach John Mabry. An accomplished pinch hitter during his career, Mabry helped Garcia prepare for scarce at-bats, but meaningful at-bats. That meant focusing on the best, most consistent parts of his approach. \n“Sometimes with power hitters and things like that you need timing for all of that to add up,” Garcia said. “To have plate discipline – you can have that when you get out of bed. You have it every single day and it’s something I can hang my hat on. Try to go out there and compete when I get those at-bats.” \nThat part-time success feeds into his full-time intentions. \nGarcia has won regular starts at shortstop, and he’s done the same when others have faltered at second base. He could push for playing time at second or as a backup to Aledmys Diaz at shortstop, or Garcia could emerge for a few at-bats out of the crowd at third base. Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak said the hope is that Jhonny Peralta wins the job at third base, though Jedd Gyorko has every right to it, and if Gyorko rakes then Peralta could join Garcia in the utility mix. \n“I want to try to win a starting job at one of those positions and see what happens,” Garcia said. “I’m not just trying to go into spring training and accept the role of not playing every day. No one in that clubhouse wants that. You want to be an everyday guy and try to show what you can do. I’m not exactly sure what that’s going to take, but I’m just going to try to work as hard as I can and see what happens.” \nDerrick Goold", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T00:02:07.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
