Framing her celeb-jawline were poker-straight strands and statement earrings. A post shared by sonamkapoor (@sonamkapoor) on Mar 10, 2017 at 1:20am PST \n2.Alia Bhatt took on cool-girl Indian-wear in a billowy Payal Singhal tunic and a drop-crotch dhoti. With her snatched bun in place, this look was a refreshing change of pace from her twee dresses. ✨ A post shared by Alia ✨⭐️ (@aliaabhatt) on Mar 9, 2017 at 3:52am PST \n3.Talking about twee dresses, Kangana Ranaut emerged in this surprise of a number. Her Valentino dress, flanked by a cutesy collar, isn’t a typical sighting but it is one that we can absolutely get used to. A post shared by Ami Patel (@stylebyami) on Mar 4, 2017 at 9:32pm PST \n4.Kareena Kapoor gave a perfect demonstration of what royals wear on a night-out – a satin calf-grazing slip, topped with a metallic biker jacket, finished flawlessly with a pair of seriously deelish heels from Fendi.

Finishing out the look with her signature blowout and heavy lashes, the actress kept to the retro memo. A post shared by Sanjana Batra (@sanjanabatra) on Feb 26, 2017 at 12:11am PST \n6.Sonakshi Sinha pulled off a Kim K-in-her-legs-for-days, nude outfit. Pairing her neutral skirt set (featuring a micro wrap skirt and a long coat) with a tucked-in lace blouse, the actress was dressed to a perfect 10. Jewellery from Eina Ahluwalia, together with softly tousled hair, tied the list-topping look together. A post shared by Sonakshi Sinha (@aslisona) on Mar 6, 2017 at 10:56pm PST \n7.Also, inspired by the most famous Kardashian was Anushka Sharma’s layered outfit that featured a button-down bodycon and a languidly-fitting knee-grazing coat (Kareena’s maternity style, anyone?) Though, if it wasn’t for her white sneakers and lazy-girl half-tied hair, this look wouldn’t be half as interesting.

Her black-and-gold sari was paired with traditional jhumkas and a last-minute bun.
