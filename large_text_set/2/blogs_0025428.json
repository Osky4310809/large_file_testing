He wore a red pilot’s suit and matching cap with goggles, as well as yellow boots and gloves and a white belt and mouth covering. \nUp until now, we weren't 100% sure if it was the Accelerated Man or when this costumed-character would appear in the show.

Earth-19 is an Earth where superheroes appeared during the Industrial Revolution of the Edwardian era, which would explain the Accelerated Man's dated look and unusual name. \nBARRY TURNS TO THE SPEED FORCE – Desperate to stop Savitar and save his friends, Barry (Grant Gustin) turns to the Speed Force for answers. H.R. (Tom Cavanagh) gives Jesse (Violett Beane) some advice. \nGregory Smith directed the episode written by Brooke Roberts & Judalina Neira. \nMORE: New Poster Teases Gorilla Grodd, The Flash Showdown / The Flash: Comparing Gorilla City to Its Comics Counterpart / The Flash Recap With Spoilers: Attack on Gorilla City \nBased on the characters from DC, The Flash is from by Bonanza Productions Inc. in association with Berlanti Productions and Warner Bros.
