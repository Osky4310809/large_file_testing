Who do you want me to fight next in the UAE? â€” Manny Pacquiao (@mannypacquiao) February 12, 2017 \nThe poll had received more than 10,000 votes by Monday morning. \nA spokesman for Pacquiao told AFP he was due to meet his manager Michael Koncz on Monday and a statement about his next fight would be issued. \nPacquiao's promoter Bob Arum had been widely quoted last month in international media as saying that the boxing icon would be getting into the ring with the unbeaten Australian Horn in April and the Queensland tourism minister said they were in negotiations to host the bout. Brook is one of the names featured on Pacquiao's list \nBut Pacquiao, 38, posted on his social media accounts that he would be fighting instead in the Middle East and seemed to indicate that while his opponent could still be Horn, it could also be one of three other world-class boxers - American Crawford or Britons Khan or Brook. \nA fight between Brook and Khan has been discussed, though promoter Eddie Hearn has said the pair have as yet been unable to agree terms on a clash and it may not take place until later in the year. Amir Khan (left) was also included on Pacquiao's poll \nReports of a bout between Pacquiao and Horn had begun circulating last month but the southpaw from the Philippines said contracts had not been signed. \n\"We are still negotiating about that. Nothing is really final, the date, who is the opponent. There are a lot of offers from other countries,\" Pacquiao said last month. Johnny Nelson is backing IBF champion Kell Brook to become a bigger name than Amir Khan \nPacquiao announced a brief retirement last year but made a successful comeback against Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas in November, saying he still felt like a youngster. \nThe boxing hero initially said he was retiring to focus on his new role as Philippine senator after winning elections last year on the back of his sporting fame.
