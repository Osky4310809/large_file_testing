(NASA/Reuters) Related Stories NASA releases thousands of photos from Apollo moon missions \nEugene Cernan, the last astronaut to walk on the moon, an experience that he said made him \"belong to the universe,\" died on Monday at the age of 82, the U.S. space agency said. \nCernan, who was also the second man to walk in space, died surrounded by his family, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a statement without providing details. \nA separate statement from his family and released by NASA said his death came after \"ongoing health issues.\" Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell, 6th man to walk on moon, dead at 85 \nCernan and fellow Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt became members of the most exclusive club in the universe on Dec. 11, 1972, when they stepped from their lunar landing module onto the moon's surface. Only 10 other people — all American astronauts — had done so before and none since. \nFor three days, the moon was home for Cernan and Schmitt. They rambled more than 30 kilometres in their lunar roving vehicle and gathered more than 100 kilograms of rocks during their 22 hours of exploration of craters and hills.

With Ronald Evans orbiting above in the command module, Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, rode the lunar lander to the moon's surface four days later. \nThey explored for about seven hours each day and Cernan wrote that moonwalking was painful for him because he had injured a tendon in his leg two months earlier playing softball. \nWe are saddened by the loss of retired NASA astronaut Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon. https://t.co/Q9OSdRewI5 pic.twitter.com/gPdFTnXF2C — @NASA \nOn the day before returning to the command module, Cernan drove the rover to a point away from the lunar module so that a camera on the vehicle could film their departure. He then paid tribute to his young daughter, Tracy. \n\"I took a moment to kneel and with a single finger, scratched Tracy's initials, TDC, in the lunar dust, knowing those three letters would remain there undisturbed for more years than anyone could imagine,\" Cernan wrote in his memoir. \nThe size 10½ boot prints that Cernan made on his walk back to the module afterward marked the last steps man has taken on the moon. Cernan said he spoke spontaneously as he returned to the lunar module. \nLast man on the Moon. Goodbye and thank you, Gene. Capt.

Godspeed to the crew of Apollo 17.\" 'I wanted to stay a while' \nIn a 2007 interview for NASA's oral history program, Cernan recalled his final moments before climbing back in the lander. \n\"Those steps up that ladder, they were tough to make,\" he said. \"I didn't want to go up. I wanted to stay a while.\" \nApollo 17 was Cernan's last flight as an astronaut after 566 hours and 15 minutes in space. \nCernan was born March 14, 1934, and grew up near Chicago. He was in the military officers training program at Purdue University, where he first met Neil Armstrong, who would become the first person to walk on the moon.

(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) \nCernan became a navy test pilot and joined the astronaut corps in October 1963. His first space flight came three years later due to a tragedy. Cernan and Thomas Stafford had been designated to be the backups for Gemini 9 and had to take over the three-day mission when the original crew members were killed in a plane crash. \nCernan became the third person — following a Russian cosmonaut and U.S. astronaut Ed White — to make a spacewalk on the Gemini mission and set what was then a record by being outside the spacecraft for two hours and nine minutes. PHOTOS NASA releases thousands of photos from Apollo moon missions \nIn 1969, Cernan was the pilot of the Apollo 10 lunar module that came within 15.6 kilometres of the moon's surface after separating from the command module. The descent toward the surface served as a dress rehearsal for Apollo 11, which two months later delivered the first men to the moon — Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. \nCernan retired from NASA and the navy in 1976. As a civilian he helped start Air One airline, worked as an energy and aerospace consultant, served as chairman of an engineering company, and was a space commentator for ABC News.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) \nIn 2011, after NASA ended the space shuttle program, Cernan joined Armstrong in testifying before a congressional committee to urge the government not to give up on space exploration. Cernan was particularly critical of the decision by President Barack Obama's administration not to pursue the Constellation program, which aimed to send astronauts to the moon and Mars. \n\"I don't think he fully understands what traditional America is all about because he didn't literally grow up here,\" Cernan said of Obama in a 2012 interview with Fox News. \nCernan met his first wife, Barbara, who had been a flight attendant for Continental Airlines, on a plane. They divorced in 1981 after 20 years and had one daughter. In 1987 he married Jan Nanna. \nCernan is survived by his wife, Jan Nanna Cernan, daughter Tracy Cernan Woolie, and stepdaughters Kelly Nanna Taff and Danielle Nanna Ellis, and nine grandchildren.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:39:27.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
