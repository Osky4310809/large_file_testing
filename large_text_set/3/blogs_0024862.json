As big statements go – music that begs a connection to the current state of world affairs – this one has only intensified in 2½ decades. \nNot many conductors could have managed as much polish as conductor laureate Charles Dutoit did Thursday night. With the appropriately wan-sounding in Verizon Hall’s second tier and Westminster Symphonic Choir in the conductor's circle, Dutoit kept the nearly 200 singers sounding no less directly connected than the dozen instrumentalists in the inner-core chamber orchestra. \nThis feature is Brittens genius stroke: While the full orchestra generally worked with the choirs, the province of the mini-orchestra, nestled at the front of the larger one, was in the intimacy of solo-vocal material. Part cantata, part lieder recital, it made for the evening’s most excruciatingly beautiful peeks into humanity. \ns musical language can be harsh, but that only heightens the emotion when he does tug at the heart. He does so often. In the “Dies Irae,” where chorus and soprano sing of guilt and mankind being called to account, the life drains out of the music like so much blood. Then tenor enters with sun and “wakes the seeds,” and the music shimmers with promise. The sequence is as moving as anything in Bach. \nSome hear literal characterizations in the parts for soprano, tenor, and baritone, and Tatiana Pavlovskaya, Steve Davislim, and Matthias Goerne filled out the roles with a specificity that brought you directly into intimate worlds. In doing so, they captured Brittens gift for ambiguities. Can two soldiers transcend national allegiance for a more human one? Is religion a comfort, or does its use here amid the horror of war only point up its own futility? \nBritten finds forgiveness, but he doesn't let us off the hook easily not at the piece's creation in 1961, and not now. \nAdditional performance: 8 p.m. Saturday i www.philorch.org 215-893-1999.
