By Kit Fox Tuesday, March 14, 2017, 12:26 pm On a long run, especially in the snow, it's better to bring company along. Derek Call \nI’ve always thought a long run with a friend is very much like a first date. In both cases, the other person sees you when you are at your most vulnerable—dreamy-eyed with a crush, or snot-filled with a side-sticker. \nAnd in both cases, long stretches of silence and heavy breathing just makes things awkward. For two hours you have to find something to talk about whilst trying not to sweat too much.

Alone. \nThat is, until this winter, when my co-worker/cubicle-mate/afternoon coffee partner, Chris Michel decided to register for the same race as me—the Big Sur International Marathon in California. \nChris lives around the corner from me and he haunts the same long-run route as me on Saturday mornings. I assume he thought it would just be more efficient if we did the miles together, so one afternoon—likely as we filled our mugs with more coffee—he asked if I wanted to run seven that weekend. \nI tepidly said yes. In my head thinking: seven miles with another person? What are we going to talk about? What if I cramp up? How many times is it appropriate to execute the farmer’s blow in front of another human? \nWe’ve now run four long runs together. This past weekend, we finished 16 miles in 20-degree weather with a headwind that seemed to change directions depending on where we were facing. It was awesome. \nI’ve realized there are many advantages to finding a long run partner like Chris. For starters—and I realize this may be unique to just Chris—he is a coffee snob. \nThirty minutes before our runs, he invites me to his home. I always arrive bleary-eyed, having rolled out of bed mere minutes beforehand. He, being a diligent father of two young children, has been up for hours. There is hot oatmeal already on the stove. He lets me in, then begins grinding Columbian beans on a 19th century grinder, presenting me with a perfect aero-pressed cup of coffee. I’ve never started out long runs better. \nAlso, Chris—much like me—has the ability to gab about pretty much anything. I tried to map out the contours of our conversation this weekend as we ran 16 miles, but it jumped around effortlessly, and randomly. Locked in stride on a gravel path, we talked about (in no particular order) his kids, the qualities that make for a good coffee grinder, the odd disappearance of Richard Simmons from public life, the even odder flavors of energy gels, the weather, politics, the pitfalls of Twitter, and why dads (Chris) are better at sleeping than single people (me). \nThe miles started to float by just like the conversation. I stopped looking at my watch. I forgot about pace. And somewhere between posturing why Simmons stopped talking to his friends and family and joking about my sleeping habits, I realized that running long with a friend is better. Much better. \nA good long run partner is a motivator, a listener, a distractor, and if you are lucky—a coffee snob. They keep you accountable when you want to turn the alarm off. They walk with you if you have a calf cramp at mile seven. They don’t mind when you do execute the farmer’s blow a few times. And quite simply, they make the whole experience much easier. \nI’ve changed my mind on long runs. I no longer want to do them alone. See you next Saturday, Chris! \n* * * \nKit is training in preparation for the 2017 Big Sur International Marathon with Runner’s World VIP.
