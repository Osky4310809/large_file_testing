The notoriously hostile duo of Jim and William Reid put aside their differences – some of them, anyway – for their first album since 1998's Munki , picking up right where \"I Hate Rock 'n' Roll\" left off.

Throughout the process, though, bassist Joseph Rowland admits to a sense of impending dread, the sense that something disastrous was near. He and vocalist Brett Campbell wrote songs that reflected the feeling that, as he puts it, \"we could be headed for some troubled times.\" The seven-song Heartless feels more aggressive and immediate than Pallbearer's previous work. The band moves out of the shadows of mythology and toward an earth riddled with new problems, broken defenses and evaporating futures. The music follows, with hooks that seem sharper and choruses that demand more attention.

The characters aren't far from those in his band's oeuvre, but he surveys their substance abuse, spiritual struggles, looming violence and generally dubious prospects with a heightened tenderness and more nuanced delivery. In terms of songwriting, he's become the indie-rock Springsteen we'd always suspected him to be, although now with a vibe more Nebraska than Born in the U.S.A. Will Hermes Hear: Spotify / Apple Music / Tidal / Amazon Music Unlimited \nJanka Nabay & the Bubu Gang, Build Music The latest from David Byrne and Yale Evelev's Luaka Bop label is swarming, beat-driven electroacoustic music echoing that of the late Nigerian synth-pop pioneer William Onyeabor – another of the label's revelations. Nabay is a Sierra Leonean immigrant known for updating bubu , a processional music defined by percussion and bamboo horns. He translates it via samples and electronics, with help from Syrian-American multi-instrumentalist Boshra AlSaadi and others. The result is hypnotic, often hectic, and wildly danceable – ancient trance music for a tightly-wound new world. Will Hermes \nAlso of Note: \nJames Blunt, The Afterlove The fifth album from the folk-pop softie features songs cowritten by OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder and Ed Sheeran. Blunt will be opening Sheeran's North American tour, starting June 29th. Betty Who Zak Cassar \nBetty Who, The Valley The Australian-born, New York-based synth-pop musician recently had her third Dance Club Songs Number One with an update of Donna Lewis' \"I Love You Always Forever.\" Her second album features it alongside rubbery singles like \"Some Kinda Wonderful\" and \"Mama Say.\" Hear: Spotify / Apple Music / Tidal / Amazon Music Unlimited \nMount Eerie, A Crow Looked at Me First as the Microphones and later Mount Eerie, Phil Elverum's legacy of blustery, drone-folk epics are eclipsed by his latest, A Crow Looked at Me. After losing his wife, artist Geneviève Castrée, to cancer in 2016, he follows up with a log of the grim days that followed in the aftermath. Braced by little more than a delicate strum of guitar, Elverum candidly details the process of grieving his loved one's absence: from its most profound in \"Swims\" (\"We're all so close to not existing at all/Except in the confusion of our survived-bys, grasping at the echoes\") down to its most mundane in \"Toothbrush/Trash\" (\"I finally took out the upstairs bathroom garbage that was sitting there/Forgotten since you were here\"). \"Look at me,\" laments Elverum, \"Death is real.\" Suzy Exposito \nTrey Songz, Tremaine the Album The sex-crazed R&B star returns for album Number Seven. Hear: Spotify / Apple Music / Tidal / Amazon Music Unlimited \nOn Fillmore, Happiness of Living Before they visited Brazil, On Fillmore – the eclectic, long-running duo of bassist Darin Gray and Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche – were used to micromanaging their sound. But, as Kotche says, \"when we got there, we saw all these people just playing and having fun, so Darin and I ditched the cerebral side and went more for the emotional side.\" Accordingly, their new album, Happiness of Living , recorded in 2013 in Rio, is their most vibrant, spontaneous to date, featuring collaborators like Atoms for Peace/Red Hot Chili Peppers percussionist Mauro Refosco and Brazilian-American singer-songwriter Gabriela Riley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:25:00.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
