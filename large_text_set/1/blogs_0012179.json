For this reason, today he wasn’t available for the starting XI, for the bench or to come with the squad. This is the reason, this is the truth about Diego.\" \nHe added: \"Today I can't be concerned about [Costa's future]. Because today my players showed me a great performance, great spirit. It's very important. \n\"When you are able to win this type of game against Leicester, 3-0, it means that I can’t be concerned about [anything]. I must be pleased for my players, to work with these players. I want to continue to work with my players.\" \nWhen pushed for a second time on whether or not Costa could return to the team for the next match against Hull City, Conte again refused to give a definitive answer. \n\"I prefer not to reply to questions that start with 'if',\" he continued. \"On Tuesday [in training] we will see what happens. \n\"We must be pleased because it's important to talk today about our win, about the players that played this game. I’m pleased because after 13 wins in a row, after a defeat, it’s always very difficult.\" \nConte insisted he was not aware of any interest in Costa from China and said any disputes within the club would be settled internally. \nCosta not keen on China move \n\"I think I read a lot of speculation about this topic,\" he said. \"I can tell [you], if there are problems with the players I'm used to solving the problem in the changing room. Not outside, not in the press conference. I repeat, if. \n\"I don’t know anything about [interest from China]. The club didn't inform me about this. For this reason it can be only speculation.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:36:32.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
