Don’t get sick. Don’t be a woman. #GOPHealthPlanIn10Words \nThe new plan cuts funding to Planned Parenthood over funding of abortion (which already doesn’t happen under law); removes rules about minimum services that healthcare plans must provide, including maternity care; changes subsidies to assist in buying health insurance from income-based to age-based; repeals taxes to benefit the wealthy ; and more. \nThe GOP, on the other hand, came ready with their regularly scheduled financial shaming, with ACA-hating-“Tea Party”-backed Representative Jason Chaffetz insinuating that people who are sick shouldn’t be able to afford anything in life aside from managing their illness: New iPhone = $28/month for 2 years Employer health insurance high deductible plan for family of 4 = $1416/month, increases every year. https://t.co/TGxxJ0hpdq \n— Vanessa North (@byVanessaNorth) March 7, 2017 \nAnd to top it all off, the written language of the bill actually refers to the Affordable Care Act as Obamacare, which has always been a GOP tactic for trying to undermine the law. If Internet comments revealing that some Trump voters don’t actually know that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are really the same thing are any indication, it worked, and it’s sickening to see that kind of smear campaign make it into a new “healthcare” law.
