The Lakers need more than just one superstar to become a title contender immediately, because they need time. D’Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson and Brandon Ingram are all quality young pieces, but even if you dropped Kevin Durant (who is the only real superstar that could really hit the market this offseason should he opt out of his player option) on the Lakers next year, that’s not a contender for that season. \nJohnson insists that the Lakers have everything they need now, except for a superstar to make everyone better. This is the kind of rhetoric that concerned Lakers fans about Johnson coming back into a position where he could have influence over personnel decisions. He’s not wrong in saying the Lakers need a top-level player. The Lakers just also need time to develop their young core and see what they have. \nThe concern for Lakers fans is that the team, which has done well so far in building a young core, will mortgage the future in an effort to contend immediately. This sentence in particular is the most concerning for how he views the process.\n“If I felt like we were far away and it was going to be a waste of my time, I wouldn’t be here and I wouldn’t have taken this road,” said Johnson. \nThe idea that a slower build is “a waste of time” signals that patience won’t be the best attribute of the Lakers front office (it rarely has been) and with this current roster that’s something the Lakers need.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:12:41.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
