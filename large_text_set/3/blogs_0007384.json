Then, out of force of habit, they voted to repeal it.\" It was a great summary: After all that time as the dog chasing the car, the Republicans have caught itâ€”and have no idea what to do now. The House GOP's hastily hatched plan has been panned by liberals, policy experts, and even conservatives, who think it's too generous . Or, as Colbert put it: \"Conservatives are calling it Obamacare Lite: great taste, less coverage.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular Beyond the grotesque aspects (some estimates hold the plan will cover 20 million fewer Americans than Obamacare) what some are calling Ryancare seems like a hodgepodge of loosely connected terms meant to appease Paul Ryan's caucus in the House and a number of special interest groups. As Colbert notes, the write-up devotes seven of its 66 pages to denying Medicaid to lottery winners. It repeals a tax on indoor tanning. It includes a tax break for insurance industry executives making more than $500,000 a year. It's not a plan to fix the system, it's a collection of narrow offerings to individual groups. As a result, no one's happy with it. But more than that, it's a symptom of two facets of late-stage conservative mania: First, as Charles P. Pierce noted yesterday , there are the dogged attempts to dismantle the social safety net at all costs, and the closely related belief that poverty is a moral failing. ( Jason Chaffetz's iPhone shaming yesterday was a timely reminder.) Second, there's the Republican Party's entrenched self-image as The Righteous Opposition, a holdover from the Obama era when everything had to be opposed and undermined, but nothing had to be built. (House Republicans voted 60 times to repeal Obamacare while President Obama was in office, but never decided on an alternative until this.) Now that it is Republicans' turns to do the building, they don't have a clue where they left the toolbox. Related Story Our Nation Is Not Healthy In the end, many Republicans who came to the bill's defense went to the visiting team's playbook of the Obama years, often choosing the dumbest option available. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, for instance, devoted an inordinate amount of time in his briefing yesterday to highlighting the difference in physical paper-stack size between the Obamacare bill and Republicare. That was an alley-oop for Melissa McCarthy on SNL this coming weekend, and it was a nice little assist for Colbert last night, too. \"If shorter is better,\" the Late Show host grinned, \"why not just a one-page plan that says, 'Walk it off'?\" More from Esquire:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:16:35.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
