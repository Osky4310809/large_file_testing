This might explain why Ice King likes Princess Bubblegum moreso than the other princesses, and it may also suggest that some of Petrikov's desires have remained even after he lost his sanity and became the Ice King. This might be a reference to the fact that Bubblegum's preliminary name was Bettie, although it's spelled differently. Simon, who was an archaeologist, is seen holding the Enchiridion , in the pictures above. Ice King has a tattoo of a penguin on his right buttock, as seen in the episode \" Prisoners of Love \" during his dream sequence. Ice King with his penguin tattoo His cut-out has Ricardio sticking out under his beard. Ice King has a computer which he uses to play video games, as seen in \" What is Life? \" and to make rudimentary drawings of himself with princesses, as seen in \" The Chamber of Frozen Blades .\" In \" A Glitch is a Glitch ,\" he uses his computer to create a virus to delete the entire universe, save him and Princess Bubblegum . However, he was stopped by Finn and Jake who saved the day through a reenactment of a disgusting video they watched at the beginning of the episode. He is currently the only main character in the series whose parents have not yet been introduced. In \"Mortal Folly,\" when Ice King tried to lift the latch on a window in order to see Princess Bubblegum, he used a small card that has the word \"Wizard\" printed on it. He sometimes falls asleep with his eyes open, as seen in \" Still .\" As Simon Petrikov , a Scientific Parasite is visible in his coat pocket. This had led fans to believe that Simon may perhaps be brilliant in his profession of Archaeology. Ice King is older than Marceline by precisely forty years, as seen in the episode \" I Remember You \" and clarified further in \" Simon & Marcy .\" [4] Ice King loves filling his bathtub up with milk and sitting in it like he is a magic angel. This is revealed in a slowed-down portion of Ice King's tapes in the episode \" Holly Jolly Secrets Part I .\" It seems that the Ice King will steal any adult female so long as she has the word \" Princess \" in her name. This is shown in \" The Chamber of Frozen Blades ,\" in which he kidnaps Doctor Princess , even though \"Princess\" is merely her surname. Ice King's favorite princesses, as he revealed in \" Princess Monster Wife ,\" are Princess Bubblegum , Muscle Princess , Skeleton Princess , Turtle Princess , Hot Dog Princess , Wildberry Princess , Elbow Princess , Slime Princess , Lumpy Space Princess , and (not an actual princess) Doctor Princess. It is revealed in \" Little Dude \" that Ice King sometimes sleeps on Finn and Jake's roof. Simon may have been a fan of the classic TV show Cheers , as he reenacted the iconic \"Norm!\" greeting in \" Simon & Marcy \" and even sang an abridged version of the theme song. Ice King is similar to the Teen Titans character Mumbo . They both have blue skin and white hair, they are both voiced by Tom Kenny , and they are both magic users with similar origins. Ice King is also similar to the Winter Warlock from Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town . They both have a long nose and beard, they both control winter and snow, and they both appear to be evil, but end up not being so bad. He is an avid fan of Marceline 's music. His favorite song may be Fry Song because he did a cover twice. In the special feature of the DVD Adventure Time: My Two Favorite People , \" Little Did You Know \", Ricardio 's \"species\" stills as Human Heart meaning, that Ice King stills genetically human. Ice King can hide items under his beard, as seen in \"Hitman\" and \"I Remember You.\" Ice King is slightly similar to Gollum in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit . Ice King refers to Betty as \"princess,\" whereas Gollum refers to his ring as \"precious.\" The crown which he purchased made him insane while the One Ring had corrupted Gollum. Also, his past from when he was Simon Petrikov is similar to Gollum's from when he was known as a Hobbit by the name of Smeagol. It was stated by Pen Ward that the Ice King's body weight fluctuates with his mood changes. Simon Petrikov's design and characteristics share many similarities with those of Milo Thatch from \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire.\" Both Simon and Milo are intellectuals fascinated with artifacts and history and both are driven to achieve their goals for the sake of knowledge. It is assumed that Simon Petrikov was enthused by his career choices (Archaeology and Anthropology) while Milo specialized proudly in Cartography and Linguistics. Simon's red bowtie and yellow undershirt are almost identical to Milo's bowtie and shirt at the start of \"Atlantis.\" They both wear glasses (although Milo's are large and clear-lensed and Simon's are small and blue-lensed) and both undertake trips to foreign lands that change their lives forever. Even the discovery and significance of the Enchiridion (for Simon) and the Shepherd's Journal (for Milo) draw shocking parallels. Ricardio seems to know about Ice King's previous life, being his former heart, and this seems to be true because in the episode \"Lady & Peebles\" when Ice King asks for a hug, Ricardio steps on him and says \"Silence, Simon!\" Like the most characters Ice King is ambidextrous. In \" Mystery Dungeon \", he is shown to be able to write with either hand in separate scenes. Ice King has many characteristics similar to Doctor Two-Brains from WordGirl . Both have something on their head that turned them insane (Simon with his crown, Steven with his helmet). Both have a photograph of their original selves wearing a green sweater and standing next to a woman. Both of their hair turned white and change in skin pigment upon going insane. Both of their hair was initially brown Both are voiced by Tom Kenny. Both were previously friends with one of the protagonists (Simon and Marceline, Steven and WordGirl). Simon might be of Eastern European origin, due to his last name. It is theorized that he is Russian, because Petrikov is a Russian name. Further more supporting this theory is that there is a Dutch brand of Vodka called Petrikov, Vodka is a Russian alcohol. Storyline analysis Edit In \" Fionna and Cake ,\" when Cake put on the Ice Queen's tiara, Fionna knocks it off, yelling, \"Take that off! You might catch her crazy!\" As \"Holly Jolly Secrets\" has revealed, the power of the Ice King's crown caused him to lose his sanity. Since Fionna and Cake and their universe are fan fiction written by the Ice King, this shows he knows to some extent, at least subconsciously, that the crown can endanger its wearer's sanity. In \" I Remember You ,\" on the newspaper clipping that Marceline shows the Ice King, we can see Simon getting out of what appears to be an old black Plymouth 4-door, holding the Enchiridion underneath his arm: this story reports that he was the archaeologist who found the legendary book. Betty can be seen sitting in the occupant's side. Over the same newspaper clipping, there are written lyrics to \" Oh, Bubblegum .\" Ice King stated he wrote the lyrics down on that paper. In a parallel of this, the picture of young Marceline has the notes that became the lyrics of the song \" Remember You \" on the back, suggesting Simon wrote those just before he lost his identity, to apologize to Marceline when she would read them in the future. Even though he has been changed by the crown, Ice King still shows signs that some vestiges of his former self remain. This can be seen in certain things he says and does. For example, in \" I Remember You \" when he finds his old scrap book filled with poignant reminders of the man he once was and his shared past with Marceline, he absentmindedly describes the pages as \"wet with tears.\" The implication is that during a recent moment of lucidity he was crying over them and has since forgotten doing so. He brings the diary entries with him as inspirational material for the song he wants Marceline to help him compose. He does not seem to remember his past as Simon Petrikov, even though he saw the history (after he found the crown) in \" Holly Jolly Secrets Part II \"; his only reaction to the tapes was shame at the fact that he previously wore glasses. This may suggest that the crown tries to suppress all living memory of Simon Petrikov in Ice King's mind. Ice King seems to act more contemplative, reasonable and conscious to others when he removes his crown for a long period of time. His clearer thinking could be due to an absence of the crown's influence. In the episode \" Holly Jolly Secrets Part I ,\" Ice King is shown (in his secret tapes) without his crown on, looking sad and more serious than normal, talking about his \"innermost thoughts.\" He begins to say \"As you can see, I'm not wearing my -\" several times before being interrupted by his penguin. It can be assumed he was referring to his missing crown, and he says that he is more contemplative than normal. Another good example is the episode \" The Party's Over, Isla de Señorita \" during which the titular character's entire encounter with the Ice King takes place while he's not wearing the crown. After much conversation between the two, she ends up making a tough, life-altering decision, and says she would never have been able to do so without the advice of her \"emotionally mature friend, Ice King.\" In the episode \" What Have You Done? ,\" he said that he got his crown through the magic that he stole. Later on in \"Holly Jolly Secrets Part II\" it is revealed that he purchased the crown in Scandinavia. This dissociation is related to the true origins of the crown, as in \" Evergreen \", it is revealed that the crown turns its wearer into \" Urgence Evergreen \", its creator, who stole the magical jewels from Magwood in order to create it. In \" Mortal Recoil ,\" Ice King exits the scene when Bubblegum is reduced from 18 to 13 years old. In \"I Remember You,\" Ice King states in his song \" Oh, Bubblegum \" that he thinks Flame Princess (who is 15) is merely \"okay.\" This indicates a lack of interest in younger-aged princesses. Appearances in other media Edit Ice King is a quest-objective character in FusionFall , and his crown is a wearable item. On New Year's Eve 2010, there was an Adventure Time marathon, and it featured bumpers with the Ice King. Ice King is one of the bosses in Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON’T KNOW! . Once you defeat him, you can play as him. He appeared in two Hole in the Wall bumpers in which he is a contestant. He tries to freeze the wall, or runs away due to the fact that he cannot not fit in either one of the holes. The Ice King costume in Regular Show In the Regular Show episode \" See You There ,\" one person is dressed like the Ice King but with the crown in a different format. He is seen many times throughout the episode. He appears in the Cartoon Network TV show MAD in the episode \"Avenger Time.\" He is called by the same name and voiced by Tom Kenny, but he has a much shorter beard and hunches over. There is a licensed Halloween costume of Ice King. Ice King is the main antagonist and one of the bosses in the video game, Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd you steal our garbage?!! The Ice King's head was used in Cartoon Network's booth for San Diego Comic-Con 2013. There was a \"Pet Society\" costume of Ice King. Ice King is a playable character in Adventure Time Battle Party . In The Simpsons episode \"Treehouse of Horror XXV,\" Homer is dressed like Ice King.
