In a new interview with Billboard , Kim has made it clear that there's no truth to the rumor, as she's not giving any thought to Minaj these days. \nI had a show and I hate stupid blogs when they try to take my damn situations and clip them. We all know the situation that’s going on with Remy and ol’ girl. That’s their situation and I have nothing to do with that. They have a rumor out there like, \"Kim is gonna do a diss track with Remy.” First of all, let me tell you this. Number one: y’all giving ol’ girl too much credit. I’m not even thinking about that. I’m not even thinking about ol’ girl! I’m so far past that. That’s never on my mind. Ever. Ol’ girl has never been on my mind for a long ass time at all. So I hate the fact of that being in the equation. \nOutside of the confusion of her intentions, Kim did have some praise for Remy's work on \"ShETHER,\" which she compared to \"Back To Back\" in that it's \"just good hip-hop music. \nBut the situation with Remy, for them to say that we were coming together to do a diss track? First of all, after hearing \"ShETHER,\" that shit is so hard, Remy don’t need no damn help! Why would I need to come together for that? I mean, I’m into the music and I’m speaking musically wise -- the song is just hard, period. Just like [ Drake 's] “Back To Back” was hard -- just good hip-hop music. But I got nothing to do with that. When I had my situation and my situation came up, I handled my business. If anybody comes to me, if ol’ girl came to me, I’ma give them the business. That’s just the bottom line of it. So if it ain’t coming my way, I ain’t got nothing to do with it. Me and Remy is cool. I hate when media do that. That’s the thing. \nRead the full interview at Billboard , and look out for a possible new collaboration from Kim, Remy and Cardi B in the tradition of \"Ladies Night.\" \nKeep up with Nicki Minaj and Remy Ma's beef in this timeline .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:38:00.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
