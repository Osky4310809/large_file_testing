On the back of Johnny Stevens’ black jacket was the word “impeach.” While the trio posed for photos, Stevens turned around while his bandmates, Richard and Ryan Meyer pointed to the script — proving it was no coincidence. \nPolitical messages have been everywhere this Fashion Week , so it’s no surprise that celebrities are using their ensembles to make their political points. Singer Skylar Grey also had an LED clutch with the words “empowerment” and “equality” scrolling across its face, while ScHoolboy Q wore a pink “Girl Power” top and hit the carpet with his daughter, who was clad in a pink pantsuit. \n— Only Hip Hop Facts (@OnlyHipHopFacts) February 13, 2017 \nThis article was originally published by Pret-a-Reporter TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:48:00.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
