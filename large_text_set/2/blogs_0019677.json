(AP Photo / Obed Zilwa) /p /cricket scandals \nSouth African cricket copped an enormous amount of grief over the Cronje affair, which exploded in April 2000 when he was charged by Delhi police with fixing ODIs against India. \nBetween being charged and his tragic death in a plane crash two years later, Cronje admitted to taking roughly $100,000 in bribes from gamblers since 1996 before being handed a life ban from cricket. \nBut the depth and history of Cronje’s shady behaviour is far more complex, and Wessels explains that he had suspicions about match-fixing before his retirement in 1994. \nDuring Wessels’ final tour, a 1994 triangular series involving Australia in Pakistan, his concerns were heightened. \n“Hansie made a few comments during the last couple of games that led me to believe that things weren’t 100 per cent right,” Wessels tells Cricket Legends. \n“We picked up a wicket and we were in the huddle and Pakistan were 4-120 or something. \n“And (Cronje) came into the huddle and said ‘don’t worry about this. We’re going to win this one because they’re not trying to win it’. \n“I’m thinking ‘where’s that coming from?’” media_camera South African cricketers Hansie Cronje (l) with Kepler Wessels in better times. \nWessels retired after that tour, but Cronje’s suspicious comments stuck with him. \nAnd when he found himself watching another ODI against Pakistan a few months later, again Wessels’ concerns were raised. \nChasing the Proteas’ modest target of 215, Pakistan appeared to be well in control at 2-101 before a stunning collapse of 8-77 — which included three run-outs — led to a 37-run loss. \n“Two or three run outs straight to Jonty Rhodes... I looked at that (collapse) and thought ‘nup, this can’t be right’,” Wessels concluded. \n“And I remembered those sort of conversations (with Cronje) and started to think all is not well.” \nLive stream India v Australia Test Series LIVE on FOX SPORTS.

So I put it behind me but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t (upset me) at the time.” \nWessels talks in depth about these topics and more from his controversial cricket journey, from the dramas of playing Test cricket for two nations to his dramatic walkout of Australian cricket in the mid-1980s. \nWATCH Cricket Legends with Kepler Wessels on Thursday on Fox Sports More channel 507 after the opening day’s play of the first Test between Australia and India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:15:39.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
