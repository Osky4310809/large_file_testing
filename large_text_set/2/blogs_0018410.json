Asiasi was a freshman in 2016 and tallied just 18 receiving yards and one touchdown on two catches. \"Yeah, he's moving on, transferring,\" Harbaugh said, per Baumgardner . \"He leaves in great status. He was doing great in school, doing great in football, really popular and well-liked by his teammates.\" Asiasi was a 4-star prospect when he arrived on campus, per Scout , but the California native traveled a long way from home to join the Wolverines. Isaiah Hole of 247Sports previously cited sources saying Asiasi was seeking a transfer closer to his home on the West Coast. Despite impressive blocking abilities that helped him see the field, Asiasi took a backseat in terms of pass-catching to established starter Jake Butt. He was lined up for a sizable increase in playing time after the latter graduated, so this is a more significant blow to the Wolverines than Asiasi's two catches as a freshman indicate. Baumgardner noted Michigan didn't sign a tight end in its 2017 recruiting class, although it has Ian Bunting, Tyrone Wheatley Jr., Sean McKeon and Nick Eubanks on the current roster to compete for starting roles.
