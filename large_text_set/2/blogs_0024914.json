It is not communication – it’s not real life,” Conway said in answer to a question about how conservative college students can survive at liberal institutions.\nShe encouraged them to join clubs, start clubs, write letters to the editor and have conversations with real people.\n“So step aside, make sure people see something other than the top of your head and live in real time in the real world – have a conversation with people,” she said.\nA lineup of Trump administration officials and influential Republicans will also speak – including Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, White House adviser Steve Bannon, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Vice President Pence.\nTrump addresses the conference on Friday.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:16:17.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
