There, the daughter of Donald Trump and Marla Maples went and everyone went nuts out over her. But not in a good way. Here’s what happened: \nNikki Ogunnaike, Fashion Editor for Elle magazine, was recently at the Phillip Plein show in Manhattan when she noticed that other fashion editors were shunning Tiffany Trump. She gleefully tweeted, “1 hour late start, editors fleeing just so they don’t have to sit behind Tiffany Trump.” \nTo make matters worse, the very rude liberals decided to tweet out photos of empty seats, gloating over the fact that Tiffany was being snubbed. Thankfully Whoopi Goldberg saw all this nonsense and decided to take matters into her own hands. She said: \n“You know what, Tiffany, I’m supposed to go to a couple more shows. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I’m coming to sit with you. Because nobody’s talking politics,” Whoopi Goldberg said. “You’re looking at fashion! She doesn’t want to talk about her dad! She’s looking at the fashion! And for Elle magazine, a magazine that says it’s a woman’s magazine, to do this!” \nIsn’t that awesome!? Tiffany was equally gracious in her response! Thank you @WhoopiGoldberg I’d love to sit with you too! Whoopi has always been kind to me when I’ve gone on her show a few times. I appreciate her putting aside her own beliefs to stick up for Trumps daughter… who, by the way, has done absolutely nothing wrong. Thanks, Whoopi — maybe the rest of the hysterical liberals can relax a bit too.
