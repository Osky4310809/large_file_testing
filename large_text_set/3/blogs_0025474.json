Shaman also has a high density of Elemental cards already, so don’t bet against the era of Shamanstone sticking around for even longer. I am pretty confident that Elemental decks will work in at least a couple of classes, and Glacial Shard will make it into them. Whalen said that in their internal testing so far, \"Shaman Elemental decks lean a bit more midrange or controlling, while Mage ones tended to be a bit more aggressive,\" but that there were plenty of different ways to go. \nTo help the tribe along, Blizzard is also adding the Elemental tag to a bunch of older cards, which I’ve collected in the panel to the right. Note that cards marked * will only be playable in Wild (RIP Rag), before Shaman mains start fantasising about the new Fireguard Destroyer meta. But simply adding the tribal tag to already strong cards could give these incoming synergy cards a serious amount of gas, as Whalen said \"several of the 'pay-off' cards, the ones that gain an effect for having played an Elemental last turn, aren't Elementals themselves.\" \nFor more info on the idea behind Elementals, check out this blog by principal game designer Mike Donais from earlier this week. He says: “We decided to put them primarily in Shaman and Mage because those are the classes that traditionally use elemental magic and summon things like Water Elementals and Fire Elementals. However, there are a bunch of Elementals in neutral and the other classes, so everyone can dabble in Elementals if they want to.” \nWhalen reiterated the point, saying that other classes \"tended to take advantage of a couple of specific Elemental cards to fit into a deck rather than playing an explicit Elemental deck.\" He also said Glacial Shard specifically can be useful in decks not built around Elemental synergies just due to its Freeze effect. \"Hunter decks, for example, can use it as a powerful tempo tool in an aggressive deck,\" which makes some sense now that we've seen the newly revealed Hunter minion, Tol'vir Warden . \nAs ever, let me know what you think of the card in the comments below. I think it’s going to be another hit like . It will be interesting to see if either Pyros or Ozruk make it into our list of the 25 best Legendary cards to craft .
