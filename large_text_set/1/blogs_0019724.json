McDonald’s has two new types of Big Macs that will make your mouth water If you know your McDonald’s history, you know the Big Mac was invented by franchisee owner Jim Delligatti back in 1967. Up until November’s experiment with the Sriracha Big Mac , the recipe stayed pretty much the same. \nBut now, for a limited time only, McDonald’s is trying two new Big Mac sizes .\nMeet (or should we say meat ) the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. The classic Big Mac is a combo of two hamburger patties sandwiches between three sesame buns — one on top, one on bottom, and one between the two patties — with lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and, of course, special sauce. \nToday, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. \nA photo posted by McDonald's (@mcdonalds) on Nov 30, 2016 at 9:51am PST \nThe Grand Mac and Mac Jr. are pretty similar — but they’ve got a few important differences. \n\nMcDonald's The Grand Mac is coming on a larger bun — meaning larger patties that add up to one-third pounds of beef. The Mac Jr. ditches the middle bun and goes for a solo (but beefed-up) patty. \nBoth sound absolutely delicious — and the fact that you can order different sizes based on your appetite is great for variety. \nCan’t decide what to have for lunch? Delicious dilemma. \nA video posted by McDonald's (@mcdonalds) on Oct 11, 2016 at 8:59am PDT \n“The Big Mac is a legend and a great-tasting burger with hints of pickle relish, mustard, garlic and onions,” shared McDonald’s Chef Mike Haracz in a statement about the new burgers . “We listened to our customers who told us they wanted different ways to enjoy the one-of-a-kind Big Mac taste. The classic combination of ingredients remains timeless and customers around the world continue to enjoy its signature taste.”\nBig Mac be #Slayin \nA photo posted by McDonald's (@mcdonalds) on Nov 7, 2016 at 9:00am PST \nNo word yet on how long these Big Mac varieties will be around — but we’re definitely lovin’ them. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T00:43:45.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
