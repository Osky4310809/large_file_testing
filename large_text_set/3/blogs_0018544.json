Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA pubgoer was 'almost killed' while his girlfriend was \"thrown around like a ragdoll\" in a brutal attack by bouncers caught on CCTV. \nMartin Wood was out celebrating his girlfriend's birthday but the night ended with him suffering a broken jaw, eye socket and nose. \nThe victim claimed doctors said that with another quarter of a centimetre impact of the fracture, he could have been killed. \nMartin Wood was out celebrating when head doorman James Turgoose at the Hype nightclub, Cleethorpes, threw the “devastating blow,\" reports the Grimbsy Telegraph. The brutal attack left Martin Wood with a broken jaw (Photo: Grimsby telegraph) \nTurgoose had worked as a door supervisor for four years and a stadium steward at Grimsby Town FC's Blundell Park ground. \nCCTV footage of the attack was shown in court and also captured fellow doorman Lee Jenson throw Mr Wood's girlfriend \"like a ragdoll\" on to the road outside the nightclub. She is seen to bang her head. \nTurgoose, 27, of Waltham, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm after a trial at Grimsby Crown Court. \nThe jury took less than 35 minutes to return a guilty verdict. The brutal attack was captured on CCTV (Photo: Grimsby telegraph) \nAfter the hearing, Mr Wood, 30, a former bar manager at Thorp Park, claimed: “The doctors said another quarter of a centimetre impact of the fracture and I could have been killed. \n“My girlfriend was thrown down like a rag doll and banged her head.\" \nHe added: “This sort of behaviour diminishes the image of the resort. I was going out for fun and a dance, not to get involved in a fight. People that do that should be dealt with. Bouncers have a duty of care to everyone.\" Martin Wood suffered a broken jaw, eye socket and nose (Photo: Grimsby telegraph) \nTurgoose received a 15-month prison sentence suspended for two years. \nHe was also ordered to do 300 hours of unpaid work and must pay compensation of £3,000 at a rate of £250 per month towards Mr Wood.

James Turgoose, 27, of Waltham, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm after a trial at Grimsby Crown Court (Photo: Grimsby telegraph) \nThe judge said Turgoose should meet his victim under a restorative justice scheme, if Mr Wood is willing. \nShe added Turgoose had worked during the day as a bricklayer and at night as a door supervisor. \nShe urged him to review his work pattern and the impact so many late nights have on his behaviour. \nTurgoose and his partner are expecting a baby in October, the court heard. \nProsecuting, Jeremy Evans told the court the incident happened in the early hours of November 6, 2015. \nHe showed the CCTV footage at the trial where Turgoose came out of the doorway and launched a single blow to Mr Wood's face causing extensive injuries. \nMr Wood and his girlfriend had an argument and left the club. The attack was captured on CCTV which shows the victim receiving a \"devastating blow\" (Photo: Grimsby telegraph) \nMr Evans said Mr Wood had not been allowed to go back into the nightclub, but his girlfriend had. \nHe said: “All he was asking the doorman to do was to look after his girlfriend and make sure she got home safely. \n“The other doorman swung her around like a rag doll. That was Mr Jenson.\" \nHe highlighted the prolonged recovery of the victim who is still troubled by numbness and has trouble sleeping. \nFor Turgoose, Jayne Bryan handed in references to the court which described the defendant as “calm and courteous\" and a positive good character. \nShe said he had never acted this way before or since the violent incident. Martin Wood's girlfriend banged her head in the attack (Photo: Grimsby telegraph) \nShe told he had since lost his licence to work as a door supervisor and he was “unlikely to darken the doors of the courtroom ever again\". \nAfter the hearing, senior advocate with the Crown Prosecution Service, Mr Evans said: “This was a brutal attack, captured on CCTV, on a man who simply wanted to ensure his girlfriend got home safely. \n\"Turgoose quite deliberately struck the victim with a devastating blow to the face which fractured his jaw, eye socket and nose.
