(Photo: MICHAEL ROLANDS/RECORD-HERALD) 7 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nINDIANOLA, IA -- Kobey Pritchard has overcome a lot. \nHe is a state-level competitive wrestler who is a force to be reckoned with on the mat. \nTraining to get to that level takes dedication and self-discipline. For Pritchard, he has the added hurdle of maneuvering with only one leg. \nWhen Pritchard was in kindergarten, sarcoma forced doctors to remove his leg. The cancer stayed away but the prosthesis was uncomfortable, so he opted for arm crutches. \nNow a teenager, he trains with his crutches, and he trains hard. \nHis hands, wrists, and forearms are shaped by callouses that form when you sprint, lift weights and work out on crutches. \nHis toughness and determination have taken him far, but heâ€™s not done yet. Pritchard plans on one-day winning an NCAA championship. \n*** \nFor more stories like this, LIKE Humankind on Facebook .
