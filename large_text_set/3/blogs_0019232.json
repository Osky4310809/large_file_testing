What a horrifying situation. \n— Laurie Penny (@PennyRed) March 22, 2017 \nThat comment immediately sparked quite a backlash online. When one person asked why she chose to tout her atheism “in the context of such a horrific event,” Penny said she didn’t want to be “inaccurate” by simply saying “prayers.” \nAt that, the responses poured in. @PennyRed @1xW__ Good job making this about you \n— Dabo's Weenie (@H1GH_SCORE) March 22, 2017 @PennyRed mate you could've just said 'thoughts and love' or something, no need to shout 'I'm an atheist!' while trying to offer solidarity \n— not a potato (@stillicides) March 22, 2017 @PennyRed \"Thoughts and atheist prayers\" is redundant. \n— Ryan Day (@ryaneatscake) March 22, 2017 @PennyRed wtf? and you wonder why people despair at the left? \n— Dr Ryan Waters UKIP (@RyanWatersUKIP) March 22, 2017 @PennyRed God bless the attention seekers. 🙄 \n— Eddie. (@thisisedzo) March 22, 2017 \nAfter receiving myriad criticisms for her tweet, Penny, seemingly confused by the backlash she had received, returned to the social media platform to say she was not intending to “insult people of faith” and accused her detractors of starting a “petty internet flamewar” in the wake of such a horrible event. Good grief. How on earth is this an appropriate time for a petty internet flamewar? People have died. Show some decency. #Westminster \n— Laurie Penny (@PennyRed) March 22, 2017 1/2 Some people seem to think that offering 'atheist prayers' for today's victims like I just did was an insult to people of faith. > \n— Laurie Penny (@PennyRed) March 22, 2017 > @PennyRed it was a sentiment, not a statement. It's sad having to clarify that when far more urgent things are happening in the world. > \n— Laurie Penny (@PennyRed) March 22, 2017 \nWhile Penny’s “atheist prayers” are certainly unique, messages of faith following attacks are nothing new. \nIn the past, conservatives have been mocked by Democrats and the media for offering prayers in the wake of tragedy — specifically, gun-related tragedy. \n— George Zornick (@gzornick) December 2, 2015 \nAfter the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, California, Huffington Post Editor Sam Stein wrote : “Every time multiple people have been gunned down in a mass shooting, all these officials can seemingly do is rush to offer their useless thoughts and prayers.” \nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) echoed the Huffington Post editor’s words in a tweet about the “thoughts and prayers” being offered by his Republican counterparts. Instead of praying, Murphy called for increased gun control. Your \"thoughts\" should be about steps to take to stop this carnage. Your \"prayers\" should be for forgiveness if you do nothing – again. \n— Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) December 2, 2015 \nAnd following the 2015 mass shooting at an Oregon community college, Stein attacked conservative politicians again for “reliably and reflexively reach[ing] for the most casual response possible: condolences of 140 characters or less to nobody in particular.” \nYet, as the Daily Caller pointed out , Murphy and Stein have offered “thoughts and prayers” of their own many times before. \nAccording to The Atlantic , this tactic against conservatives quickly became known as “prayer shaming” and was used to push for gun control laws: \nThere’s a clear claim being made here, and one with an edge: Democrats care about doing something and taking action while Republicans waste time offering meaningless prayers. These two reactions, policy-making and praying, are portrayed as mutually exclusive, coming from totally contrasting worldviews. \nOnly time will tell if “atheist prayers” are considered to be just as toxic by the left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:45:34.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
