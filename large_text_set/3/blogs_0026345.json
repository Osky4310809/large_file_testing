With preview builds like this, some developers stay away since there will likely be tons of changes made between now and the final release. To save time, many will just wait until the final build is released and then start to work on them.\nThat wasn’t he case for XDA Senior Moderator and Recognized Developer Chainfire as he began working on gaining root access to Android O DP1 very quickly. Within the first 24 hours of release, Chainfire announced he was able to gain root access to Android O, but said there were some bugs to squash before anything could be released. There wasn’t a mention about which device(s) he had worked on, but we at least knew root was possible with DP1 and that’s always good to hear.\nSo yesterday, Chainfire released a preliminary work-in-progress root solution for both the Nexus 5X as well as the Nexus 6P . It is an alpha build of SuperSU v2.79 SR4 so this means you might encounter some bugs, as some changes were made in order to get things working. For example, both of these devices suffer from a kernel panic if SuperSU’s daemon loads at early boot. To get around this, because the origin of the kernel panic is unknown at this time, exec mode is skipped, and even the service launch is delayed on Android O DP1.\nSome people were running into a bootloop with this version, so in the post there’s a second test version that delays the service launch even more. Chainfire hasn’t been able to test this on the Pixel C or the Nexus Player , so your mileage may vary on those two devices. The Pixel and Pixel XL are said to be having issues with this alpha build of SuperSU due to the A/B partition layout. Debugging this is time-consuming, but Chainfire hasn’t ruled them out just yet.\nCheck Out the XDA Forum Post for Downloads ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:54:03.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
