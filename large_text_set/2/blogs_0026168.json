Odegaard is the victim of a stamp (Photo: IMG) \nBut after only two-and-a-half seasons, Odegaard has found himself shipped out on loan to Eredivisie side Herenveen. \nAnd if Zinedine Zidane's plan was to toughen the 18-year-old up, it looks to be working. Odegaard receives a nasty challenge to the back of his leg (Photo: IMG) \nIn the space of three weeks, Odegaard has been the victim of two separate straight red card challenges. \nThe first came against Utrecht on February 5. After turning his marker, Odegaard is pulled down and stamped on for his troubles. Odegaard cries out in pain (Photo: IMG) \nThe second challenge came against Roda on Saturday. Again, in a very similar part of the pitch, the Norwegian pips his marker to the ball before receiving a high-studded challenge to the back of the leg. \nHopefully Odegaard can find inspiration in Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale who both toughened up in the Premier League before conquering La Liga with Real Madrid. poll loading Will Martin Odegaard become a Real Madrid star one day? 4000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:21:53.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
