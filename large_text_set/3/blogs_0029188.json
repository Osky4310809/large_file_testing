Cop-turned-slasher faces 60 new murder charges, death toll at 82 Published time: 27 Mar, 2017 20:16 Get short URL © Телекомпания АКТИС / YouTube A former Russian policeman, Mikhail Popkov, who is already serving a life sentence for killing 22 women, has been charged with an additional 60 murders. If the charges are proven, it will make Popkov Russia’s worst-ever serial killer.

The bodies had to be recovered from “forests, lakes, and swamps with the help of heavy machinery and divers” often using pointers from Popkov himself. \nAlthough his actions “gave reason to doubt his sanity,” extended psychiatric testing in Moscow showed that Popkov did not suffer from any “permanent or temporary” forms of mental illness, and was “fully aware of the nature and social harm of his actions.” \n“The forensic sexologist has concluded that Popkov suffers from homicidal mania with sadistic tendencies,” says the statement. ‘Punishing loose women’ \n53-year-old Popkov was a master skier in his youth and married with a daughter when he began working as a sergeant in the police department of Angarsk, a Siberian city of about 200,000 people in the early '90s.

He would put on his uniform, then park his car outside nightclubs, restaurants, and other public places, waiting for drunk, unaccompanied women to emerge. \nThe killer would then lure the victim into his car, with a promise of help or fun, and then take them to the woods, rape them and then kill them, with an axe, knife, bat, awl or another hand-held weapon, which he sometimes took from the evidence locker. \nMostly, he attacked one woman at a time, though at one point managed to stalk down and kill two victims. \nIn media interviews given after his capture, Popkov said that his killing spree was trigged by his wife cheating on him with a colleague and that he sought to “punish loose women.” \nThere were several near-misses. One of his victims, attacked in 1998, survived and identified Popkov and his modus operandi to his colleagues. However, her testimony was dismissed when Popkov's wife provided an alibi. The wife and daughter, who have changed names and moved, have since gone on TV saying they had no suspicions of Popkov’s actions.

He admitted that when he began his spree, he never expected forensic technology to develop sufficiently to catch him. \nPopkov was convicted of murdering 22 women in January 2015, as well as two attempted murder charges. \nThe new charges will be heard at a trial in November or December this year. \nSources in the Investigative Committee told the Russian portal Life News that Popkov expressed no reasons for his desire to reveal more murders. Two legal experts interviewed by the same outlet speculated that Popkov is trying to extend his time in pretrial detention, where his living conditions are easier, rather than being sent down to a penal colony. \nForensic psychiatrist Mihail Vinogradov suggests that Popkov could be driven by vanity in trying to raise his number of victims above that of other notorious serial killers. \nAndrei Chikatilo was proved to have murdered at least 53 people between 1978 and 1990, often grotesquely mutilating his mostly young male and female victims. He was executed in 1994.
