Buhari \nNkem-Abonta noted that the “lack of experience of most of President Buhari’s appointees has not in any way helped the economy grow the way it should grow. Take for example, the Minister of Power heading three engineering based ministries, Housing, Power and Works, what results do we expect from him?” \nNwulu who represents Lagos, said: “My colleague is just patronising this government because depression has started even in my state. There are no two ways about it, you can’t bring a carpenter to do the job of an engineer because the end result will be total failure.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T08:09:33.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
