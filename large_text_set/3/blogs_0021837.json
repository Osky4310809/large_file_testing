The anger and hurts caused from such a hoax are difficult and so unnecessary.\" \nTalbott is expected to face a charge of false report to a peace officer. The Denison Police Department also plans to seek restitution for the cost of the investigation. \n\"It's unfortunate a person can falsely report such a major incident in our community that wastes the time of law enforcement and needlessly puts some people in fear,\" Burch said. JUST IN: Denison Police say sexual assault victim's story unfounded, woman admitted wounds were self-inflicted @FOX4 pic.twitter.com/TLVmBKO0PZ — Lynnanne Nguyen (@LynnanneFOX4) March 22, 2017 \nThe department believes Talbott staged the crime scene March 8. She also admitted that the cuts on her body were self-inflicted. \nOfficers initially responded to a call from a man, who described himself as her fiancĂŠ and claimed she was missing . He said her vehicle had been found outside an apartment in the 3800 block of Texoma Parkway about 5:30 p.m. with the driver's door open and her phone, keys and a shoe nearby. \nThe department mobilized all available resources to look for her, even putting other cases aside to focus on the apparent abduction. \nShe later walked into New Creation Church, in the 3400 block of South Eisenhower Parkway, where she told witnesses she'd been kidnapped and sexually assaulted in the woods behind the building. \nTalbott told detectives she was near her vehicle at the apartment when \"three black males\" in ski masks kidnapped her in a black SUV before raping her. \nShe was taken to a hospital, where, Burch said, \"it is our understanding that medical personnel who examined Talbott were unable to corroborate that Talbott had been sexually assaulted.\" \nWithin a day or two of the incident, detectives doubted most of her allegations. \n\"The puzzle pieces just weren't coming together,\" Burch said. \"We were unable to corroborate any of Talbott's allegations that she had been abducted or sexually assaulted.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T21:08:52.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
