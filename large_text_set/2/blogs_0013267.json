Fresh off his understated, intimate show at New York Fashion Week , Kanye West’s YEEZY label just dropped the first items from Season 4 online. Two women’s footwear offerings include the PVC Tubular Boot, which costs $950 USD, and the low-cut PVC Mule, which costs $650 USD. A clear PVC upper and acetate sole gives the illusion that the natural leather footbed (and the wearer’s feet) are suspended in mid-air.\nFor the dudes, there’s a re-release of the high-top Crepe Boot, which debuted in YEEZY Season 2. Available in murdered-out Oil or light tan Sand, it retails for $645 USD. Meanwhile, the new men’s Combat Boot silhouette builds on Season 3’s rugged jungle boot-inspired shoe, including the contrasting suede/nylon upper, and adds a chunky lug sole. Like the Crepe Boots, it’s offered in Oil and Sand. It’s the cheapest of the bunch, priced at $445 USD.\nAlso for sale is the Season 4 Zine, featuring plenty of NSFW images, which we previewed here . It costs $80 USD.\nEverything is available on yeezysupply.com right now, and purchases are expected to ship within a week.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:15:45.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
