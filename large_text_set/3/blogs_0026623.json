I play for the group.\" \nBenzema is also enjoying working under fellow countryman Zinedine Zidane, with a Madrid legend handed the reins to help deliver further success – with the 2016 Champions League crown already captured. \n\"He gives confidence to the group, knows how to speak to the players and is very calm,” added Benzema. \n\"He does not panic and he calms us.\" \n'CSL can't sign Messi or Ronaldo' \nBenzema has endured a testing 2016-17 campaign in Madrid, with a demanding fan base making him the subject of jeers at times. \nHe has, however, contributed 16 goals to the cause, including three efforts in as many games during a successful Club World Cup campaign.
