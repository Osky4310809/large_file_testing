Source: DPA \nBritain’s plans to leave the European single market are jeopardizing its efforts to become a manufacturing center for electric cars. \nFaced with political uncertainty, luxury automaker BMW is weighing a plan to manufacture its electric Mini compact in Germany instead of Britain, according to Handelsblatt sources at the company. \nSources at BMW said it wouldn’t make sense to invest in Mini’s main plant in Oxford if Britain makes good on its vow to leave the single market. \nBMW plans to make its entire line of Mini cars fully electric. Producing the first generation electric Mini in Germany, then, would potentially threaten the future of the Mini plant in Oxford. \nBMW is looking at its plants in Leipzig and Regensburg as alternatives to Oxford. The Dutch automotive company Nedcar, which already produces two Mini models in Limburg, is also under consideration. \nWith the electric Mini slated to debut in 2019, BMW has to make a decision about production in the second half of the year. The automaker plans to start talks with the British government in the coming weeks, though BMW declined to officially comment. \n\nThe loss of the electric Mini would be a major blow to Britain’s automobile industry, given BMW’s plans to make its entire line of Mini cars fully electric. Producing the first generation electric Mini in Germany would potentially threaten the future of the plant in Oxford. \nThe British government has sought to make the United Kingdom a center of cutting-edge automotive technology. In November, London unveiled plans to invest 390 million pounds, or $484.5 million, in the development of electric and self-driving cars. \nBut Prime Minister Theresa May rattled the automobile industry in January when she announced that Britain would leave both the single market and the European Union, a so-called “hard Brexit”, raising concerns that automakers in Britain would face European tariffs. \nAs the owner of the British brands Mini and Rolls Royce, BMW would be particularly hard hit by trade barriers across the English Channel. \nEight of 10 vehicles that BMW manufactures in Britain are for export, more than half of which go to the European continent. The BMW Group manufactures more than 200,000 Mini cars a year at the plant in Oxford alone and employs more than 24,000 people in Britain. \nFaced with this uncertainty, BMW wants guarantees from the British government that will allow it to plan for the coming decade. \n\nLast fall, British Business Secretary Greg Clark said Britain would aim to negotiate tariff-free access to the single market for the automobile industry. \nIn order to leave the single market while protecting the automobile industry from tariffs, the British government would have to negotiate exceptions for automakers. All 27 of the remaining E.U. members states, however, would have to approve such exceptions, a hurdle Britain is unlikely to surpass. \nFaced with this uncertainty, BMW wants guarantees from the British government that will allow it to plan for the coming decade. \nIf the past is any predictor of the future, the British government could still convince BMW to produce the electric Mini in Britain. London managed to convince Japanese carmaker Nissan to remain in Britain last fall. The details of the agreement still haven’t been made public. \nHowever, Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn has expressed doubts about the future business climate in Britain in the wake of Ms. May’s announcement that her government would pursue a hard Brexit. \n“I do not know what Brexit is for now,” Mr. Ghosn told the French magazine Le Point, according to The Guardian newspaper. “What we have made is European investment, not British, based in Britain … If walls are erected between the EU and Britain, investments will be reduced.” \n\nKerstin Leitel is a correspondent for Handelsblatt in London.
