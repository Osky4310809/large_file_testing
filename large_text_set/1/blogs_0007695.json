Investigation: French police and a TV crew stand outside the location of the robbery in Paris in October (AP) \nFrench radio and TV reports on Monday said DNA traces from the scene of the heist led police to the suspects and that they would be held for questioning, possibly for as much as four days. \nA police source told Reuters that one of those detained was Kardashian's chauffeur when she was visiting Paris in October for Fashion Week and that police were trying to establish whether he had passed on information to the gang. Badly shaken: Kim and Kanye (REUTERS) \nMs Kardashian, 36, was photographed frequently while on the Paris trip, attending fashion shows and parties. She also posted numerous pictures to her social media accounts. \nJean Veil, a French lawyer for Kardashian, told France 2 television: \"She (Kardashian) is very happy, very satisfied and to a certain extent reassured by the efficiency of the French police.\" Robbery: Police fear it may have been an inside job (AP) \nThieves wearing ski masks and clothes with police markings burst into the luxury property where Kardashian, who is married to U.S rap star Kanye West, was sleeping in the early hours of Oct. 3. \nThey tied her up at gunpoint before making off with her engagement ring and other jewels, police said. \nThey fled on bicycles with the jewellery worth $9.5 million. Kim Kardashian posts first selfie of 2017 after social media silence \nThe reality star, married to rapper Kanye West, was badly shaken but physically unharmed. \nShe has mostly since kept a low public profile but broke her silence on the robbery in a promotional clip for the upcoming season of her reality TV show \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" which was released on Friday. \nA tearful Ms Kardashian told her family: \"It makes me so upset to think about it.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T09:57:35.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
