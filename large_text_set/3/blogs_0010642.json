FPAI also mentioned that they the ISL needs to introduce a minimum salary cap in order to ensure the well being of a player. \nDSK Shivajians miss I-League record by whisker \nThe Players Association also pointed that there mustn’t be a limit to the number of Indian players a franchise could sign as it restricts the opportunity for several players. \nWith lack of clarity on how the 2017-18 season would pan out, the FPAI remarked that the players aren’t sure as to what would be the maximum length of the contract. They asked for a definitive plan which would help the players plan better. \nHowever, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) have reiterated their stand of not acknowledging the FPAI. \n“As the AIFF, we do not recognize the FPAI,” a top AIFF official informed Goal . \nQuestioned on the reason for the same, the official responded, “Their structure isn’t correct.” \nThe FPAI was formed in 2006 by Bhaichung Bhutia and is the sole representative body for professional players in India. It was handed recognition by FIFPro, the worldwide representative body for players, in 2009 and is registered under the Society’s Act in India. \nFormer India international Renedy Singh currently serves as FPAI's president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T08:52:36.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
