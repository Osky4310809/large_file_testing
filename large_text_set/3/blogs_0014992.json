Gorsuch replied to the email, writing, “Sounds interesting. Glad to see you’re doing this. I may tray [sic] to attend some of it.” \nIn a later email from December 2005, Gorsuch was informed that von Spakovsky was in consideration for an opening in the Federal Election Commission. The email conceded that “there will be stories” and that it will be “a little bit of a fight in the press.” Despite these concerns, Gorsuch responded to the email, writing, “Good for Hans!” \nGorsuch’s time in the Justice Department overlapped with von Spakovsky in 2005, when Gorsuch was the principal deputy to the associate attorney general and von Spakovsky was special counsel to Brad Schlozman, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, The Nation reported. Schlozman and von Spakovsky took control of the Civil Rights Division in the Justice Department and reversed its traditional role in protecting the voting rights of minorities. \nPer The Nation : \nIn particular, von Spakovsky manipulated the process to approve Georgia’s strict voter-ID law in 2005, which was among the first of its kind. (I tell this story in great detail in my book Give Us the Ballot.) Von Spakovsky had been an advocate of such laws nationally and in Georgia specifically, where he was from, since the 1990s. “Requiring official picture identification such as a driver’s license with a current address would immediately cut down on a large amount of fraud,” he wrote in The Wall Street Journal in 1995. Two years later, he recommended, “Georgia should require all potential voters to present reliable photo identifications at their polling locations to help prevent impostors from voting.” \nTo justify these voting restrictions, von Spakovsky has a history of trying to spread the myth of massive voter fraud. When von Spakovsky worked in the government he was able to change language in a GOP study on voter fraud so that the conclusion was that there was “a great deal of debate on the pervasiveness of fraud.” \nDespite all the facts to the contrary.
