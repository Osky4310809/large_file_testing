Everyone shook hands on Saturday. (Jason Getz/USA TODAY Sports) ESPN did a weird thing on Saturday ahead of the Peach Bowl when it circulated a clip online showing Alabama’s captains refusing to shake hands with their Washington counterparts after the coin toss.\nAlabama wasn't interested in the pregame handshake today. https://t.co/kYXvQi89kN\n— ESPN (@espn) December 31, 2016\nThe clip went viral quickly, inspiring hundreds of hot takes criticizing the Crimson Tide for being “ embarrassing ” or “ arrogant ” or even “ classless ,” but the network — and many of the other outlets picking up this “story” — left out a pretty important part.\nAlabama captains DID shake hands prior to the coin flip. Just not after the coin flip. #CFBPlayoff\n— Kevin McGuire (@KevinOnCFB) December 31, 2016\nThe Crimson Tide didn’t snub anyone, actually. They just shook hands ahead of the coin toss instead of after it.\nAt press time, Alabama led Washington 17-7 in the third quarter.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jasonrmcintyre/status/815294669735141377", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/CFBPlayoff?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/KevinOnCFB/status/815292734135222272", "https://twitter.com/rcmcrey/status/815308765180416000", "https://twitter.com/espn/status/815302890134925313", "https://twitter.com/@marissapayne", "https://twitter.com/Michael_Tacker1/status/815305719285186560"], "published": "2016-12-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:45:22.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
