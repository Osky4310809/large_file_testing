Memory, insight, and judgment can become impaired. Insomnia may occur. Visual problems may develop, including the inability of pupils to react to the light.\" \nEven though Beutler does acknowledge he can't answer for sure if Trump suffers from \"this condition,\" he basically contradicts himself by saying he \"cannot, of course, establish this diagnosis from a distance,\" right after essentially writing a diagnosis from a distance. \nThere's a history of physicians attempting to diagnose politicians from afar, in fact, in 1973, following the 1964 presidential election, the American Psychiatric Association implemented the \" Goldwater Rule \" which states, \"it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.\" \nBut Trump's health has become par for the course for his opponents, and as the New Republic article points out, Sen. Al Franken recently slammed Trump over his health, claiming that 'a few' Republicans are worried about Trump's mental capacity. \nFranken continued saying Trump's actions are \"not the norm for a president of the United States, or, actually, for a human being.\" More from AOL.com :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:47:00.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
