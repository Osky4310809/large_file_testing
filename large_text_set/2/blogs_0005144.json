Fixed it for you. If you called Rob Portman’s office over the last couple of weeks to express concerns about the confirmation of Betsy DeVos, you probably got an email from him today, like I did. I took the liberty of making some changes (in italics) to help the senator more accurately say what he actually meant. Dear Kate, Thank you for contacting me to express your views on Betsy DeVos, the Secretary of the United States Department of Education. I appreciate you taking the time to contact me, but I had absolutely no intention of taking your concerns into consideration. I supported Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education because during the confirmation process, she c̶o̶m̶m̶i̶t̶t̶e̶d̶ claimed to strongly support public education despite a long track record proving her contempt for it ; and because of her support for local control, instead of having the federal government dictate education policy at the state and local level. This the same argument we Republicans make about everything we don’t want to support. Saying “Hey, listen — I agree, I just don’t think that’s our job” works in tons of situations when I want to look like a moderate but am too chicken to cross the aisle. (I don’t know why you’re surprised, since that’s how I couched my support for marriage equality — and were happy about that, weren’t you?) I look forward to working with her to improve our K-12 public education system, make college more affordable, stand up for children with disabilities even though her answers on this showed a stunning lack of familiarity with IDEA , and close the skills gap by promoting Career and Technical Education (CTE) to give young people more opportunities to succeed. I don’t know what that means, but I like the way it sounds. In addition, I do give some deference to the President choosing his cabinet, as I did when supporting President Obama’s nominees. Never mind that his nominees are a bunch of billionaires and corporate stooges. Mine is not to question why; mine is but to rubber stamp and toe the party line. Also, she gave me $51k. In the 21st century economy, a high quality education is critical to the social and economic well-being of our nation. I believe that the most important role in educating tomorrow’s workforce is played by billionaire heiresses , parents, teachers, mentors, and community leaders at the state and local level. At a time when young people are leaving our state, we must work collaboratively in our communities to give students the tools necessary to compete in high demand fields in Ohio. Never mind that Betsy deVos has no idea what these might be. These are just words. Thank you again for taking the time to contact my office. And again, I’m thanking you, but I don’t really care what you think. For more information you can visit my website at www.portman.senate.gov . Please keep i̶n̶ ̶t̶o̶u̶c̶h̶ your opinions to yourself next time. It will save us both a lot of time.
