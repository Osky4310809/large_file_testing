Those somebodies make up the Capitol Police. \nAll day long, protesters have been trying to disrupt the confirmation hearing for attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. They've posed as KKK members. They've called him \"Pure evil!\" They've called him a fascist pig. \nBut thanks to the Capitol Police, these frequent disruptions have been short. \nIt can't be fun to have to stay on your feet, literally and figuratively, waiting for protests you know are coming. But Capitol Police have been swiftly escorting protesters out of the hearing room in the most orderly way possible. \nIt's important that these proceedings not be disrupted. Senators get only one chance to publicly question a Cabinet nominee before they have to decide how to vote. Disruptions only waste everyone's time, and they don't give senators any new information. \nDon't you think all the senators already know that some people think Sessions is a racist? Posing as a Ku Klux Klan member and masquerading as a Sessions supporter doesn't do anything productive. \nOf course, it's important to keep Cabinet nominees and members of Congress safe from threats. Capitol Police do a tremendous job of this. \nWe should be thankful everyday that Capitol Police keep every member of Congress safe, even the ones we don't like. But they deserve extra praise today and over the coming weeks for handling protesters so professionally. \nHundreds of thousands of people will visit the Capitol for Inauguration next week. Many of them will be protesters. This presents a whole new host of challenges for law enforcement to handle. Thankfully, Capitol Police and many other law enforcement agencies will do their best to ensure everything goes according to plan.
