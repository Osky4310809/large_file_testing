Scott will not be forgotten.” \nShe spoke of the depth of Von Lanken’s faith and his love for his wife, Shellie, and their twin daughters Cassie and Crystal Von Lanken. Von Lanken and his wife, Shellie, were never seen apart, Blaylock said. They traveled by motorcycle to California, Arizona and Yellowstone National Park.\nRelated Articles February 6, 2017 PHOTOS: Scott Von Lanken funeral, hundreds honor slain RTD officer February 3, 2017 First-degree murder charge filed against man accused of killing RTD security officer February 2, 2017 Denver mosque leaders warned Homeland Security that RTD shooting suspect “was advanced in his path of radicalization” February 2, 2017 Denver mosque leaders feared RTD shooting suspect had radicalized, reported him to Homeland Security February 1, 2017 Man accused of shooting RTD guard at Union Station was former soldier who posted about police, Islam Blaylock said she lost her daughter and husband to a drunken driver and offered to Shellie the words she said helped her move through her own grief: “The secret things belong to God.”\nBlaylock also read aloud an emotional letter Cassie wrote to her father, in which she reminisced about making snow angels with her dad and sister, and thanking him for loving their family.\n“Like an eagle, you had a vision that reached over every territorial terrain and reached the horizon of every glorious sunset and morning dawn,” Cassie wrote of her dad, who she said loved eagles. “Like an eagle sometimes you would fly alone confident in the course of your creator’s plan… Thank you for loving God more than life itself.”\nVon Lanken, 56, was killed late the night of Jan. 31, shot in the head as he gave directions to two women who were trying to find their light rail train. His alleged killer was arrested about a half hour later and is being held without bail in Denver’s downtown detention center.\nRTD commander John Perry described Von Lanken, a former La Crosse, Wis., police officer who had worked RTD security for about six years, as a great leader who was positive and had uplifting thoughts. He said he would often get caught up talking to Von Lanken as he was leaving work for the day.\n“It seemed like every evening I was leaving the building during the nights that Scott worked, I would be drawn in by him for a 30 minute discussion about life, faith, family and the current hot topic of the week,” he said. “When I heard about the circumstances that surrounded Scott’s death, it was no surprise to me that he was interacting with two of our patrons and giving them directions. This type of interaction was his speciality.”\nPerry grew more emotional as continued to speak about Von Lanken and said he made service to others his mission and truly represented the intent of a first responder’s job.\n“Service to others in our profession is why we all do what we do on a daily basis,” he said. “Scott made it easy to leave his legacy in all of us. We will never forget you. God bless you, my friend.”\nAfter the service, Von Lanken’s remains were taken to Estes Park Memorial Garden for burial.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:57:18.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
