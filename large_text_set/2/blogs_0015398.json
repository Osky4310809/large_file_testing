But their first loss to Western Sydney Wanderers in over three years, 1-0 on Saturday night, gave Melbourne Victory a sniff with seven games remaining. \nA convincing 3-0 win over Central Coast Mariners on Sunday duly followed, with Victory now facing two games that could decide where they finish. \nREPORT: Berisha double, Victory masterclass restarts A-League title race \nSydney FC too have two weeks that could change their season from best-ever to not even the best in 2016-17. \nFriday night sees the Sky Blues travel to third placed Melbourne City. A loss would give Melbourne Victory a chance to once again cut the gap, this time to five points, when they play Adelaide United on Saturday night. \nThen, to start March, the two powerhouses will walk out at Allianz Stadium for a blockbuster that could well and truly alter the winner of the Premiers’ Plate. WSW v SYD: Match Highlights 4:25 \nTwo Victory wins and two Sydney losses and it’s game on — with just two points separating them. \nIf Sydney FC regroup to pick up maximum points in their next two games, they could once again restore a 14-point lead (depending on Victory’s result to last place Adelaide) and wrap up their first piece of silverware in seven years. \nThese are two weeks of A-League football you can’t afford to miss. \nHere are the main moments from Central Coast v Melbourne Victory ... \nCENTRAL COAST’S BID FOR RECORD STOPPED \nOnly two teams have won four games on the bounce, and unsurprisingly they are the two best teams in the country. \nYet Central Coast Mariners were one win away from hitting that mark before Melbourne Victory showed them what it takes to be one of the top six teams. \nCoach Paul Okon was clear it was just another game, yet it could have edged his side closer to a much needed finals spot. Instead, they sit second from bottom, with 11 losses from 20. Brosque robbed of penalty 0:24 \nBERISHA SCORES IN LANDMARK GAME \nIt was a landmark game for Besart Berisha when he walked out at Central Coast Stadium. \nMaking his 150th A-League appearance, the Albanian star did what he has always done best — scoring, again. This was his 96th goal since arriving Down Under, picking up three Championships in that time. \nThen, as the game wound down, Berisha was at it again — netting his 97th strike with a driven left footed effort. \nThat also took him to 49 goals for Melbourne Victory as two more landmarks loom. \nCLINICAL TROISI FINALLY SCORES \nJames Troisi is putting himself front and centre for a call up to the Socceroos squad next month. \nAfter buzzing around all first half and playing a role in Berisha’s early strike, the Victory attacker also managed to smack the upright before the break. \nInvolved in everything good about Melbourne’s attack, Troisi added his name to the scoresheet with a clinical finish in the 58th minute — a rasping left foot drive into the far side netting. James Troisi, Besart Berisha and Marco Rojas celebrate.
