The NBI has to do some housecleaning to regain public trust,” Pimentel said. \nPimentel urged Gierran to take a firm stand in disciplining NBI personnel to avoid another embarrassment to the government.   \nMeanwhile, Sen. Risa Hontiveros welcomed a decision giving the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency the task to implement the war against drugs, although she said it was nothing new because it is the PDEA’s mandate to go after illegal drugs. \nUnless the government’s anti-illegal drugs strategy is radically overhauled, Hontiveros said the campaign would “continue to be abusive and corrupt prone.” \nShe said law enforcement agencies should start cleansing their ranks of scalawags.
