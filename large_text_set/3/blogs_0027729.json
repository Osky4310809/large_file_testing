Peyton had to be kept in a 'sandwich bag' when she was first born (Photo: SWNS) \n\"She only weighed 811 grams and she gave out such a cute yawn when she was born - but then the nurses and doctors rushed her off to save her. \n\"I was heartbroken, angry at myself and guilty for not being able to keep my baby safe for a few more weeks. \n\"I was just so terrified that my baby, who has taken seven long years to get here, might not make it.\" Becky holds both Peyton and a loaf of bread, which is what her daughter weighed when she was born (Photo: SWNS) \nBecky and hubby Steve, 29, had tried for seven years to conceive naturally, \nbut turned to IVF and had everything planned together on their baby journey. \nBecky had been injecting hormones into her body during that time, but turned to the IVF procedure which took on their first cycle on February 4, 2016. \nDespite being due on October 22, Becky was horrified to be bleeding twenty four weeks into her term and gave birth to baby Peyton in July. \nHowever, despite being premature Peyton is in the top 50 per cent of babies for her premature age. Becky, Steve and baby Peyton (Photo: SWNS) \nSpeaking about the early birth, Becky, from Sheffield, South Yorks., said: \n\"During my pregnancy I did everything by the book and all the scans were normal. \n\"But then my blood pressure became dangerously high and I was rushed to the Jessop Wing and after examination I was found to be two centimetres dilated. \n\"I was given two steroid injections to mature my baby's lungs - and was then prepared for what could happen. \n\"Within seconds of the birth, a team of doctors and nurses rushed in and put Peyton onto the 'resuscitaire' (a warming therapy which is set up to deal with resuscitation or other emergencies) before she was taken to NICU. \n\"I was warned that sixty per cent of babies born at 24 weeks only survive past the first month. Baby Peyton is now thriving (Photo: SWNS) \n\"But now Peyton is nine months and doing really well and I've been told that development-wise she is within the top fifty percent of babies for her age. \n\"They say she might have problems when she is older, but that might just be bad at maths or spelling. \n\"She could suffer from Cerebral Palsy, but so far there have been no signs of that - so we are both over the moon on how well she is doing.\" \nAround 8,000 babies are born each year at the Jessop Wing - which includes caring for 900 critically ill and premature babies in one of the largest Neonatal Intensive Care Units in the country. \nBecky has said she is now raising money for the wing in a bid to give something back in thanks for the care the couple and Peyton received. \nShe added: \"The care we received at NICU was out of this world and we were kept informed of everything during the 121 days she was there.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T16:47:31.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
