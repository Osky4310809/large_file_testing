Orji Kalu \nHis is one of Mr Presidents nightmare. The man deliberately book genuine people and info to Nigerian president in the name of keeping his job. Not minding the office of president. However, PDP is dead in Edo State where Mr Mike come also PDP BOT Chairman and Minister of Work. What are they doing for Mr President to help him win election.
