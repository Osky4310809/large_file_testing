And the dedicated actor that he is, he won’t even let his birthday play spoilsport in his plans. Shahid turns 36 on February 25 and to mark the occasion, his darling wife Mira has reportedly planned a birthday bash on February 19. The interesting part about the party is that it will boast of a ‘healthy’ menu, so that it doesn’t play havoc with Shahid’s ongoing diet. According to reports, Mira has carefully chalked out the menu and only included super foods, salads, smoothies and guilt-free desserts. Turns out, no alcohol will be served at the bash – instead, the drinks menu will include detox shots made of diet food like cucumber, kale, carrot, kiwi and celery. The guest list reportedly includes Shahid’s ‘Rangoon’ co-stars Saif Ali Khan and Kangana Ranaut. The Bachchans too have been invited to the bash.
