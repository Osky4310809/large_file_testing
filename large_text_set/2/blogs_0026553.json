They're either fantastic or they're just plain rotten and today they were just plain rotten. \n\"Where was that energy that at the start of the season Liverpool had? Closing people down, running at defenders, good movement. You name it, Liverpool had it. \n\"Do Liverpool actually realise they've got a chance of finishing in the top four? This performance today reminded me of a side who were stuck bang in the middle of the table who couldn't go down and who couldn't go up any higher or get into Europe or anything.
