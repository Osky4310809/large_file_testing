It took less than two mintues for me to understand it, using the video. Once implementing a couple of drop zones that trigger a window layout, I quickly discovered that this tool saves a lot of time and energy. Less time manually resizing and coordinating finder and app windows is required as a result of this app. No software conflicts either. I also implemented an “extra” feature that comes included. I set up double clicking on the title bar to move the selected window to a specific area with a specific size. This gets me out of trouble when certain apps don’t play well with Mac Os and don’t properly switch out of full screen mode or won’t resize between screens easily. It’s also a quick way to get things out of the way. I make use of all trackpad gestures, and in any ways, this makes Mac Os a breeze. However, the addition of this app adds another level of convenience and organization. Impressive and convenient. Very happy with the purchase. Much better than macOS window docking and split implementation by ACGarland Without this app, I’d be very frustrated—having come from long-time use of Windows. This is one feature which Windows handles so much better than macOS: in a far more intuitive way and isn’t constantly forcing you to reach for the mouse or trackpad. And this app brings all that ease-of-use (and more) to the macOS environment. Even though macOS has support for snapping/docking windows and split-view, the implementation is quite lame: 1) no easy way to do it from the keyboard; 2) doesn’t work AT ALL unless you have thing set for each display to be treated as a separate space. (What?! I’ve got three displays and use 5 spaces and you want me to try to track 15 separate spaces just so I can reasonably snap and split views? No thanks: I prefer 5 spaces, each with the complete set of displays.) Anyway, this app doesn’t suffer from those shortcomings.One of my most-used apps since switching to the Mac. Its like a new computer!! by WoodBurnt I grew up with DOS ->Microsoft -> Windows where this technology was available around 30 years ago. Upon retiring I bought an IMac thinking that it would work seamlessly with my various IOS products. That was major misconception on my part, but I liked my IMAC overall and it became my desktop replacement. I did however, find the poor windows management extremely frustrating and was determined to switch back to Microsoft on my next purchase. Today an advertisement for another screen management tool got me curious enough to go to the App Store where I found BetterSnapTool. It worked immediately and allows me to have several apps open and at my fingertips. It will be a huge timesaver and has re-kindled my previously waning passion for computers and more specifically for Apple. Why this is is an add-on bewilders me, but for now I am very happy with my \"new\" computer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T12:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T08:13:21.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
