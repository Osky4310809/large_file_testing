Do you get it? Yeah you get it. So Wendy’s is a bitch though huh? She brought the claws out when McDonald’s announced something about their quarter pounders. I never understood why a fast food place would go after another fast food place. I understand competition and all that shit but all of your food sucks. It sucks and it’s gross, I mean that in the best way possible, but it still sucks. Wendy’s getting on their high horse about their food is like a homeless guy making fun of another homeless guy. Don’t get me wrong, I love fast food. I LOVE fast food. Fast food signs are like beacons of light whenever you see one. It just feels like a glass house situation when one fast food place points at another fast food place and says, “You’re food isn’t of the highest quality!” Of course it is you dumb fucks! That’s the point of fast food. That’s why they call is fast food in the first place. If I wanted better food I’d go to a restaurant. So sit the fuck down Wendy and shut up.
