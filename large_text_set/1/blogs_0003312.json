Harrison Barnes debuts his signature dish, the All-Star burger pic.twitter.com/azGmRCAFHq \n— Arya Ahmadi (@aryaahmadi) January 3, 2017 \n\nHarrison Barnes was maligned for his “max” contract during the 2016 offseason, but the former Golden State Warriors forward has played quite well during his debut season with the Dallas Mavericks. With that in mind, his new squad is apparently beginning a full-blown pitch for Barnes’ inclusion in the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, and it includes naming an in-arena burger after Barnes. \nAs noted above, the burger includes a 1/3-pound patty with pepper-jack pickled-jalapeño cheese spread, cajun spice aioli, lettuce, and tomatoes on a corn-dusted Brioche bun. It is also served with always fantastic arena french fries for the paltry sum of just $12. \nWhile the burger might look fantastic in its optimal presentation above, a different angle shows that it might not be all it is cracked up to be. \n\nThe Harrison Barnes All-Star Burger (available all month at the American Airlines Center) in all its glory: pic.twitter.com/hvYEO2cuyb \n— Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) January 3, 2017 \n\nBarnes is averaging 20.4 points (on 46.7 percent shooting) and 5.5 rebounds per game this season and he has been the focal point of the offense in Dallas with the lengthy absence of Dirk Nowitzki. Still, it is a stretch to consider Barnes among the league’s elite to the point that he is probably on the outside looking in with regard to an All-Star selection.\nThere is no shame in the Mavericks pushing their best option for the All-Star Game and this is actually an interesting way to do it. Now, we’ll see if this All-Star pitch is enough to do what many others could not in actually helping to get a player voted in and/or selected. In any event, there’s never a bad time for a burger.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:37:45.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
