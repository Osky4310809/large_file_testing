He pledged to release video of the interaction in full Monday. \nWord of the new video drew a group of protesters that grew to about 100 Sunday night. Eventually the market closed, and police cleared the parking lot. \nShortly before midnight, 7 or 8 shots were heard from an area across the street from the market. There appeared to be no injuries. Someone stuffed a rag in the gas tank of a police car, but the damage was minor. +11 \nPolice and protesters take cover behind police cars as shots are fired outside of Ferguson Market in Ferguson on Sunday, March 12, 2017. Photo by David Carson, \nThe documentary theorizes that Brown had an arrangement with employees to exchange store merchandise for marijuana, and that footage released by police in the days after the shooting shows the second part of such an exchange, not Brown robbing the store. \nFerguson Market attorney Jay Kanzler, who spoke with a group of angry protesters outside the market Sunday night, said the newly surfaced surveillance video of Brown visiting the store about 1 a.m. had long been in the hands of authorities and Brown’s family. \nThere was no exchange of drugs for anything from the store, Kanzler said. The footage in the documentary does show Brown putting what appears to be marijuana on the counter at the shop, but it has been edited to cut out Ferguson Market employees throwing back the bag, Kanzler said. \n“The video has been out there,” Kanzler said, alluding to multiple people he said had seen it, including lawyers, prosecutors and Brown’s family. “This isn’t new.” \nHe later retreated into the store after protesters started swearing at him. Not long after, police arrested several protesters. \nThe protest Sunday at the market on West Florissant Avenue came after the documentary, “Stranger Fruit,” premiered Saturday at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas. The film highlights surveillance footage showing Brown visiting the store about 1 a.m. on Aug. 9, 2014. That was about 11 hours before he returned to the store in what has been portrayed as a strong-arm robbery. \nBrown was fatally shot in a confrontation with a Ferguson police officer just after that second visit to the store. Looking back: Ferguson as it unfolded \nFilmmaker Jason Pollock argues that Brown exchanged a small amount of marijuana with store clerks for two boxes of cigarillos in that first, early morning visit to the store, according to a clip of the documentary included in a story by the New York Times . He suggests Brown left the merchandise at the store to retrieve at a later point, and asserts that the video footage of Brown in the store later in the day shows not a robbery but rather Brown picking up the merchandise. \n“Mike did not rob the store,” says the film narrator. \nFerguson Market co-owner And Patel said Sunday that he was not at the store at the time of Brown’s 1 a.m. visit and was unaware of any arrangement between his employees and Brown. But Patel, 59, re-asserted that Brown robbed the store of a package of cigarillos in the second visit to the store just before noon. \nPatel said Brown had “grabbed the cigarillos and stole them.” \nVideo footage of that incident was released by police days after Brown was killed. The video shows Brown strong-arming his way out of the store with the cigarillos. Brown is shown grabbing and shoving Patel in that video, recorded minutes before Brown’s fatal encounter with then-Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson on a street in the nearby Canfield Green Apartment Complex. \nPollock questions why only the second tape was released publicly by police in the aftermath of the shooting. \n“They destroyed Michael’s character with the tape, and they didn’t show us what actually happened,” Pollock told the Times. \nIt’s unclear from the footage what’s contained in the small package that Brown handed to store clerks, but the footage appears to show clerks holding the contents to their noses to smell. \nSt. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar and former Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told the Post-Dispatch Saturday that they hadn’t seen the video. \nPollock was alerted to the existence of the surveillance when he saw Brown’s earlier visit to the store mentioned in police records, according to the New York Times. Pollock later obtained the footage, though it’s unclear how. \nBusiness was brisk outside the market on Sunday with a steady stream of customers coming and going. Numerous customers said they were unaware of the newly released video. \nProtesters arrived in the evening and stood outside with signs. Someone used chalk to write “Justice for Mike Brown” on the parking lot. \nFerguson and later St. Louis County police arrived on the scene to monitor the protest, which grew more heated later in the night. Police and protesters ducked behind cars when the shots rang out. West Florissant was closed for a time as police investigated the gunfire. \nShots fired near market during protest, but no one injured.
