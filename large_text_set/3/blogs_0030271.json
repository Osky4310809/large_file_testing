Not only are Americans making their voices heard, but more and more people are buying art supplies for protest signs . Since there’s nothing better than a fresh set of paint and brand new colorful markers, we totally love that these creative tools are entering more homes.\nAccording to a study done by The NPD Group , events like the Women’s March this past January helped poster board sales rise up to 33 percent. Makes sense, since there’s a good chance that the last time you used poster board was for a middle school science fair.\nBut, that’s not all. Flip chart sales also rose about 28 percent. Just under that, specialty marker sales grew by 24%, and fabric paint sales (for shirts, of course) were three times higher than they were last year at the same time.\nEven glue, a product we use pretty often as-is, saw a 27% increase.\nWe’re loving these numbers. Seriously. Not only do they show us how many Americans have been involved in supporting causes that we believe in, but it shows that we’re still incredibly creative people . If you can recall, there were so many moving, funny, and thought-inspiring banners and signs on display at Women’s Marches throughout the world.\nIn fact, you might remember that actor Nick Offerman decided to create a book about the clever signs that he saw during the day.\nHey could someone do a dope coffee table book of all the genius/righteous signs frm #WomensMarch & proceeds go to @PPact ? #Please &ThankYou\n— Nick Offerman (@Nick_Offerman) January 22, 2017 #WomensMarch book in the works! Details to follow. Let's get @KellyannePolls a nap, her shit is tired. #Fact https://t.co/aqiEFrvpp7 \n— Nick Offerman (@Nick_Offerman) January 23, 2017 The lesson here? A lot of good happens when you express yourself through art. Next time there’s a movement that you want to protest, or a cause you’d love to support, consider visiting your local art supply store for some incredible inspiration.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T19:33:18.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
