Siemian's smarts, precise footwork and command of the offense made him Kubiak's clear choice to be the starter this past season. But Siemian's limitations, such as durability, size and athleticism, remain too. And those are some of Lynch's best traits. \nA new scheme under offensive coordinator Mike McCoy could even the playing field. Joseph has raved about McCoy's ability to design a system around his players rather than forcing them to play a specific scheme. \nIn 2016, the Broncos were often predictable, as well as ineffective, on offense. They ranked 22nd or worse in four main offensive categories: scoring, passing, rushing and total offense. \n“I want an offense that is attacking,\" Joseph said. \nHe wants the Broncos' standard to be scoring 28 points a game, a number that would have ranked third in the NFL this past season. That would also be 7.2 points more than Denver averaged in 2016. \nRegardless of the Broncos' offensive issues (offensive line, running game, etc.), the pressure to deliver for any team falls largely on the quarterback. \nLynch was drafted to be the Broncos' quarterback of the future. Teams don't use first-round picks on quarterbacks to keep them on the bench. That being said, Lynch has to prove he deserves to be the starter. He didn't do so last season. \nLynch appeared to struggle to adjust to Kubiak's scheme as he tried to learn a new offense from the spread he ran at Memphis. McCoy and quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave will need to work with Lynch to figure out if he's ready to start. \nThe buzzwords around what to expect from McCoy's offense have been creativity, energy and flexibility. That may benefit Lynch, who often appeared lost during his rookie season. His footwork, pocket presence and overall understanding of the offense all need significant improvement. \nStill, in limited time, he made a few plays that showed why the Broncos traded up to get him. He has a powerful arm and the ability to elude defenders. How much he progresses in Year 2 will be fascinating to watch. \nThe Broncos should hope their 2017 starter is also their quarterback of the future. But they may not have that luxury if neither Lynch nor Siemian appears ready to win big. \nBringing in a third quarterback is likely. The big move would be bringing in a veteran on the free-agent or trade market, possibly to usurp Lynch and Siemian. The Broncos have yet to rule that out, and some of the names being tossed about — Tony Romo , Tyrod Taylor , Philip Rivers , Colin Kaepernick — will continue to attract buzz until the situation becomes clearer. \nThe reality is that bringing in any veteran quarterback has risks and questions, whether age, price, talent, compensation, fit or simply team interest. The biggest factor could be the message it would send to Siemian and Lynch. \nAre the Broncos ready to mark their 2016 first-round pick as a failure after one season? Unlikely. \nBut the Broncos have a lot more questions than answers right now regarding their quarterback situation. \nUp next: The running backs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:04:50.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
