But you just got blocked. Sure, you grabbed a rebound but your back is facing the basket. There’s no way you can get a clean shot off. It’s best to look around for a nearby opponent so you can run a play. \nDavid West is by the free throw line. That kind of shot, while it isn’t flashy in any sense, could work! Points are points, right? All right, ready. Pass that — oh you’re going for the shot anyway. Aaaand it’s in. \nSorry I ever doubted you, Steph. Please keep making these threes.
