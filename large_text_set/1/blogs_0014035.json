We were a bit tense at the start, but in the second half played with more freedom,\" Aubameyang said on beIN Sport . \n\"Unfortunately, we conceded a goal that we shouldn't have conceded at the end. We shouldn't have given the foul away. \n\"It will teach us not to repeat the same mistakes. We're going to pick up two more wins. We remain positive, we're at home. \n\"We made a mistake, we will change course and win the next game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T03:16:04.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
