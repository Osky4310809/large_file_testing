It boasts 3 kitchens, 12 bedrooms, 21 bathrooms, 38,000 square feet and it’s about to be the feature of CNBC ‘s Secret Lives of the Super Rich , premiering tomorrow night at 10pm.\nThis comically opulent home would make the Russian Tzars of yesteryear blush. This is more house than any one family could ever take advantage of. Built by Bruce Makowsky of BAM Luxury Group, this is the culmination of one man’s career in building outlandishly extravagant homes for billionaires, a world of real estate where nothing is off limits.\n\nAs I mentioned in the headline, there’s a frickin’ handcrafted steel staircase in this house worth $2 million by itself . To get up and down this mansion’s 4 floors you’ll use the private elevator lined with alligator-skin leather. It has an 85-foot-long infinity pool with a swim-up bar and a mother fucking movie screen which pops out of the ground next to the pool.\nBruce Makowsky / BAM Luxury Development\n\nWith a house this impressive whoever moves in will be hosting a shit ton of parties, and beyond the 21 bathrooms there are 3 kitchens to accommodate a host of hungry guests. There are also TWO wine cellars because billionaires have figured out that putting money into rare wine is safer than investing in gold and silver these days.\nOF COURSE there’s a movie theater room, but that’s not even an impressive feature because a ton of homes have those these days. What sets this movie theater apart from others are the 40 luxurious leather seats (stadium seating), all facing the 30-foot-tall TV that bills itself as the ‘most advanced home theater in the country’.\nThe mansion boasts a glass pool table worth $12,000 and there’s an entire fucking wall lined with cereal dispensers. At no point in my adult life have I ever finished a box of cereal without having to toss it away after going stale, but I’m sure the billionaire who purchases this home will be able to eat an entire wall of cereal on the regular…I’m sure.\nAs I stated above, this mansion will be featured on CNBC ‘s Secret Lives of the Super Rich tomorrow evening (Thursday January 18th) at 10pm, so if you’re interested in seeing an in-depth special on this mansion then set your DVR accordingly.\nGoing back just two years the most expensive home in America was listed at only $139 million. This Bel-Air mansion carries a price tag of $250 million. I think it’s safe to say that the market’s a bitch right now.\n( h/t FORBES ) \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:31:31.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
