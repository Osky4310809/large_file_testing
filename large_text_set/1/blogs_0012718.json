Naturally, Nick gave Corinne the group date rose because boobs, that’s why. However, in a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, Nick claimed he was “uncomfortable” with that much freeing of the nipple. \nNick said, \nI think you even saw on the show that I was sort of caught off guard, and quite honestly, I was a little uncomfortable, but I like people and women who are expressive and confident and willing to take risks. I think we should be careful about judging and criticizing people so quickly for doing that. \nOK, so first, he’s saying he was “uncomfortable.” \nThen, he’s all like, “Do not judge lest ye be judged also do not throw a boob if you live in a glass house.” \nI’m paraphrasing, people! RELAX ! \nNick went on to talk about Corinne’s motivation for her aquatic striptease. He added, \nCorinne was in the moment and certainly was being guided by the photographer and I don’t think she meant anything by that, but I was a little bit uncomfortable. Of course, anyone with the bird’s eye perspective knows Corinne is literally the villain of the show. \nI mean, come on. Corinnne is 24 years old and still has a nanny; Corinne said her dad would be “proud” of her taking her clothes off. Corinne is a… Giphy \nLike, RUN. \nSomeone get Nick to a safe house and inform the Witness Protection Program it has another person to give a new identity to. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
