Rowling this week, taking another dig at the Harry Potter author. \nDuring Tuesday's episode of ITV's Good Morning Britain, the stars were discussing how Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them won the Oscar for Costume Design - the first time a Potter film has captured a prize at the ceremony. \n\"I wouldn't know one end of a muggle from a Voldemort,\" Piers said. \"I've never read them. J.K. Rowling was incredibly irritating. I've never got it.\" Piers hasn't been won over yet (Photo: ITV) \nThe row with Rowling had culminated in Piers insisting he'd never read a word of Harry Potter, despite writing a column about it some years previously - and even his own son decided to side with the author. \nUploading a picture of the Deathly Hallows symbol he's got tattooed on his bicep, Spencer Morgan shared it with both his dad and Rowling, captioning the snap: \"Well this is awkward.\" \nSure enough, Piers took the bait and tweeted to say Spencer could no longer look forward to enjoying the fruits of his dad's labour as he was no longer in Piers' will. \n\"My son will be sorrier, I just cut him out of my will. cc @spencermorgan93 ,\" he posted. \nThere's been no response yet from Spencer, though he has been sharing pictures of himself holding a Gryffindor scarf while standing outside a model of Hogwarts, and of himself waiting to go into the Cursed Child play.
