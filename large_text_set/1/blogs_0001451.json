The minister should apologise to the women of the country and resign,” Kumaramangalam told the Press Trust of India news agency. \nIndia has been shamed by shocking levels of sexual assault against women, which came into sharp focus in December 2012 when a student was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi and later died of her injuries, leading to the official cancellation of that year’s New Year celebrations. \nSome of the country’s most senior politicians have been accused of casual misogyny, with the leader of one political party widely condemned for brushing off the December 2012 attack by saying “boys will be boys”. \nThe attacks in Bangalore have drawn comparison with last year’s mass sexual assaults at New Year’s celebrations in the German city of Cologne, where police were also accused of losing control. \nSenior Bangalore police officer Malini Krishnamoorthy told AFP no complaint had yet been filed and officers were scanning hours’ worth of CCTV footage. \n“We have appealed to the public to come forward if they have evidence in any form,” the officer added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T11:51:10.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
