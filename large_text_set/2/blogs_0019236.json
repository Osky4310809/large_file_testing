Highlights of the Sky Bet Championship match between Sheffield Wednesday and Brentford \n\"The referee in the first half was a disaster,\" he said. \"A very poor performance, he made everybody nervous, he made the fans nervous, he made my players nervous and he made me nervous. \n\"He didn't see a clear penalty, he didn't see a block on (Vincent) Sasso for their second goal and there were a lot of faults and little things that made everyone nervous. I checked the video and it is a clear foul on Fernando. \n\"We can achieve a very good position, but the referee was very poor, these are the facts. I hope in the future we can achieve a good position, but I hope we have more luck. The referee was very, very poor, I am not judging, I am just talking facts. \n\"We played very poorly in the first half. We didn't start well, but we played three days ago and Brentford didn't. \n\"The second half, the Brentford goalkeeper was fantastic, he made some great saves. We fought a lot and made opportunities but we didn't score. But I don't want to give excuses.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:15:08.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
