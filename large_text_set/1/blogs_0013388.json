(Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports) \nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Verizon IndyCar Series chairman Mark Miles enjoyed a comforting lull of business going as planned. Grand Prix of St. Petersburg promoter Kevin Savoree was eagerly anticipating the series opener less than two months away. \nIndyCar’s annual winter meetings at a historic hotel just a few blocks from the harborside street course underscored the proximity of the upcoming 2017 season as series executives, promoters and television executive gathered for an assessment of the last campaign and the upcoming slate of 17 races. \n“We want to make sure our promoters have all the information we have about acceptance in the marketplace, growth in the marketplace, so they can incorporate any of that into their sales strategies going forward and then it’s looking at this year,” Miles told USA TODAY Sports. “They’ve already this morning seen the new marketing materials — broadcast, electronic, print — and heard a little more approach to what we call our co-op program where we put in some money to help them with their advertising in their market.” \nCHANGE: AJ Foyt Racing switches to Chevrolet for 2017 season \nNBC Sports executive producer Sam Flood apparently had encouraging words in his briefing with the group, describing the relationship with the series as “from the competitive standpoint and a viewership standpoint, it’s been a lovely combination.” \nIndyCar viewership reached 6.5 million last season, NBC’s highest mark since acquiring broadcast rights in 2009. Ratings increased by seven percent in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Flood attributed some of the improvement to being able to centralize IndyCar, Formula 1, and importantly, he said, NASCAR, on a single network. \n“We’ve been able to grow the rating for IndyCar dramatically over the past few years by exposing the NASCAR fan to IndyCar,” he told USA TODAY Sports. “The rating are up dramatically. And the scheduling of the races, the IndyCar team has done a great job creating a schedule that works really well to flow audience. \n“Any time you can grow a property to the ratings growth of the past two years, something’s going great.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:58:13.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
