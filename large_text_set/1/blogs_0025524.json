If I got a job as Rob Lowe’s personal assistant, I would expect certain things from day one. Things like occasionally being splattered with self-tanner, weekly scoldings for buying the wrong brand of almond milk, and late-night phone calls from Winona Ryder . (He’d be like, “TELL HER I’M DEAD,” then I’d tell her he’s dead, and then she’d scream, “I HEARD HIM TELL YOU TO TELL ME HE’S DEAD.”) That stuff, I assume, just comes with the territory.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nBut I now know his personal assistants should never assume anything. Why? Because it’s the first of seven requirements reportedly found in a job listing for his personal assistant gig. ( NOTE : TMZ notes that Rob’s team denied that the listing is his, but claim their sources “insist” that it is.)\nPer TMZ, they include :\nAdvertisement \n\n— Never assume anything\n— Ensure the CLIENT [Rob] is fed and has coffee throughout the day\n— Schedule haircuts every episode for the CLIENT\n— Ensure that the CLIENT HAS A DINNER PLAN IF ARRIVING HOME LATER THAN 8 PM in the evening\n— Make sure you let Estate staff know if the CLIENT wants a Jacuzzi turned on or a massage ordered for his arrival\n— Willing to travel on location as requested and serve as the CLIENT’S body man\n— Able to lift up to 25 pounds as required to support THE CLIENT\nFar be it from me to roll my eyes at anyone who’s gotta have their java, but Rob Lowe’s gotta have his java, a full stomach, dinner plans, a Jacuzzi that’s hot and bubbling whenever he needs a soak, a masseuse who’s ready the moment he’s got a knot, a willful servant for every extended trip, and someone who can lift exactly 25 pounds at the drop of a hat.\nIf everything you’ve gotta have won’t fit on a mug, you’re asking for too much!\n\nImage via Amazon.
