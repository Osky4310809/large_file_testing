Britax Recalls Over 700,000 Strollers Due to Falling Risk for Infants in Car Seat Babble Editors image source: britax \nStrollers may very well be the hardest product to pick out for your little one’s arrival. There are so many different features to consider, not to mention safety concerns. \nThat’s why it’s important to do ample research and be on top of the latest recalls, like this one: the Britax B-Agile and BOB Motion Strollers. \nBritax has recalled 676,000 strollers in the U.S. (along with 36,400 in Canada and 4,600 in Mexico) due to a risk of infants falling out of the car seat , according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). \nThere have been “33 reports of car seats unexpectedly disconnecting from the strollers and falling to the ground, resulting in 26 reports of injuries to children, including scratches, bruises, cuts, and bumps to the head,” the CPSC reports. There are also an additional “1,337 reports of strollers with damaged Click & Go receiver mounts.” \nThe issue is with the Click & Go receiver mounts on these two units. According to the Britax website, issues can arise when the strollers are in travel mode with a car seat carrier attached. \nBe careful to read through the recommendations, and make sure Baby is safe. Which strollers were affected? \nCheck the model number of your stroller to see if it is included in the recall. For single strollers, the number can be found on the inside of your stroller’s metal frame, near the right rear wheel. For double strollers, it will be on the front middle underside of the frame. It can also be found on a label affixed to the exterior of the retail box. For a full list of models that were affected , visit Britax. Where were they sold? \nAccording to the CPSC, they were sold at Babies R Us, buybuy Baby, Target, and other stores nationwide, as well as online at Amazon.com, albeebaby.com, buybuybaby.com, diapers.com, ToysRUs.com, and other websites from May 2011 through February 2017. What should I do if I (yikes!) have a stroller? \nYou should stop using your Click & Go receiver mounts and visit us.britax.com/recall for a free set of reinforced receivers for single strollers. If you own a double stroller, contact customer service at 844-227-0300 to learn how to use your stroller safely, without the car seats attached.
