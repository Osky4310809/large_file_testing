Among churches that reject the doctrine of the Trinity are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , Jehovah's Witnesses , Christian Scientists , Unitarians , the Unification Church, the Christadelphians , Oneness Pentecostals and others. More about Faith Groups that Reject the Trinity . The Expression of the Trinity in Scripture \nAlthough the term \"Trinity\" is not found in the Bible, most Bible scholars agree that its meaning is clearly expressed. All through the Bible, God is presented as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is not three gods, but three persons in the one and only God. \nTyndale Bible Dictionary states: \"The Scriptures present the Father as the source of creation, the giver of life, and God of all the universe. The Son is depicted as the image of the invisible God, the exact representation of his being and nature, and the Messiah-Redeemer. The Spirit is God in action, God reaching people—influencing them, regenerating them, infilling them, and guiding them. All three are a tri-unity, inhabiting one another and working together to accomplish the divine design in the universe.\" \nHere are some key verses expressing the concept of the Trinity: \nGo therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ... (Matthew 28:19, ESV ) \n[Jesus said,] \"But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. \" (John 15:26, ESV) \nThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. (2 Corinthians 13:14, ESV) \nThe nature of God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit can be seen clearly at these two major events in the Gospels : The Baptism of Jesus - Jesus came to John the Baptist to be baptized. As Jesus rose up out of the water, heaven opened, and the Spirit of God, like a dove, descended upon him. Witnesses to the baptism heard a voice from heaven saying, \"This is my son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\" The Father clearly announced Jesus’ identity, and the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus, empowering him to begin his ministry. The Transfiguration of Jesus - Jesus took Peter, James, and John to the top of a mountain to pray, but the three disciples fell asleep. When they awoke, they were astonished to see Jesus talking with Moses and Elijah . Jesus was transformed. His face shone like the sun, and his clothing dazzled. Then a voice from heaven said: \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.\" At the time, the disciples did not fully understand the event, but today readers of the Bible can clearly see God the Father directly and powerfully linked to Jesus in this account.
