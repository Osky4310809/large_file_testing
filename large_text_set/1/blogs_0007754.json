NBC points out, the show faced heavy competition for male viewers from ESPN’s Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl coverage,” the news site added.   \nThe Rose Bowl was in fact a barn burner with the USC Trojans defeating the Penn State Nittany Lions (after multiple lead changes) in a closing seconds 52 to 49. The game ended about 9:30 p.m. Eastern, an hour-and-a-half into Schwarzenegger’s premiere for a large segment of the country. It was followed immediately by the Super Bowl, featuring Auburn against the Univ. of Oklahoma. \nTrump, who remains the executive producer of Celebrity Apprentice , did not seem to think the programming competition was the deciding factor. He tweeted on Friday: Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got \"swamped\" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for…. \n— Donald J.
