By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 6, 2017 2:20 PM Aadhaar Card. Source: PTI \nThe Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has been taken against 12 websites and 12 mobile apps (from the Play Store) that are illegally providing Aadhaar related services and have asked them to shut down, 26 more websites and apps are under the radar of UIDAI which have also been asked to shut down. None of the culprits have been named by the agency. All the apps and websites which have now been blacklisted by UIDAI provided unauthorised Aadhaar related services like providing status of Aadhaar generation, downloading the Aadhaar card, PVC Aadhaar Card, etc. to users, and collected data about Aadhaar numbers and enrolment details. The actions of the apps and websites have been deemed illegal as none of their owner were authorised by UIDAI to provide such services or collect the data. \nThis is not the first time such action when UIDAI has taken such an action. In April 2016, the Unique Identification Authority of India had asked companies like Flipkart , Amazon , eBay, etc to not allow any merchant to collect Aadhaar information from the general public on their platform. \nYou may also want to watch- \nUsers can get their copy of Aadhaar for free from the online portal of Aadhar at http://eaadhaar.uidai.gov.in/ and they can get it printed in a black and white format. It has become increasingly important for the government to secure the Aadhaar database as it is now being used as a universal ID all over the country. Earlier in January 2017, the government announced Aadhaar Pay which allows anyone to link their bank account with their Aadhaar number, to make and receive payments electronically. \nA new app named Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) has also been launched by the Government of India and it allows users to send and receive money using their 12-digit Aadhaar number. Apart than this, the TRAI had also said that the mobile subscriber base should be verified under the Aadhaar eKYC.
