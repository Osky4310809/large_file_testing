And at this point, that’s the only way to do it, linking the Trump campaign to Putin… Donald Trump helped himself today, but he’d better watch his back. Not since Richard Nixon has the national press corps been so determined to bring someone down.” \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T04:31:56.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
