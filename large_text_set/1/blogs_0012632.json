But for the DC service industry, inauguration weekend also means packed seats and massive profits. \nNow, one campaign is bringing together the capital’s top restaurants, bars, cafes, and distilleries to pledge a portion of their inflated inauguration profits to local service organizations and causes—many of which have been threatened by Trump’s discriminatory political policies. \nAll in Service DC , the brainchild of local service industry professionals Amanda Carper and Alaina Dyne, launched in late December 2016 with the mission to highlight the diversity and compassion of their community as a whole. With an all-female staff of volunteers, the organization has already signed on 54 businesses to participate in the campaign and are hoping to recruit more before Inauguration Day. \nA number of high-profile dining destinations, including Café Saint-Ex, 24/7 Diner, Chez Billy Sud, and the new Momofuku CCDC have joined the cause, pledging to donate funds collected over the January 20–22 weekend to a diverse group of nonprofits.

Chefs Be Worried that Donald Trump Is Moving into the White House? \nThough All in Service is promoting the campaign as a celebration of diversity—rather than a direct affront to the President-elect’s agenda—many of the participating businesses have chosen to financially support Planned Parenthood, an organization Trump repeatedly threatened to defund over the course of his campaign because they provide abortion services.

However, as Trump prepares to make the move from a gold-gilded Manhattan penthouse to the White House, DC chefs and restaurateurs have been left to speculate how this massive shift in power will affect the District’s dining scene as a whole.
