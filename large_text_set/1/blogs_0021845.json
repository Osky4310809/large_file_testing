Majority want to leave single market to gain immigration control \nTheresa May's Brexit plans seem to be going down well with the British people. \nWhile Remainers are concerned about what it would mean for the economy, some 74 per cent of Brits want control over EU immigration and 57 per cent want to leave the single market and replace it with new deals. \nLeavers are predictably more in favour of these two measures - with over three quarters of them saying that leaving the single market and controlling EU immigration is the right thing to do. Chart - Brexit polling, immigration and sngle market But they're happy to back May on open Irish border and shared intelligence \nD espite the country potentially heading for a Hard Brexit , there are areas where British people think it's right to keep some aspects of their EU relationship going. \nThey're happy to maintain the open border with the Republic of Ireland, to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in Britain , and to continue to share security information. \nEven among those who voted leave, support for these three European collaborations doesn't fall below 67 per cent - with maintaining an open Irish border being the least popular of the three. Chart - brexit polling intelligence sharing The divisions between Remainers and Brexiters haven't been healed \nT hree quarters of Leave voters are set on regaining full control over how Britain is governed and who can live here, even if that means not having a free trade relationship with the EU. \nMeanwhile, 48 per cent of Remain voters think the Government should be trying to get Britain to remain in the EU altogether. A further 17 per cent think that we should be seek some form of associate membership in order to remain as close as possible to the EU. \nDespite the Prime Minister calling for unity and for both sides of the Brexit debate to come together, YouGov polling shows there's little hint of compromise on either side. Chart - Brexit polling, leavers and remainers still miles apart But they are accepting that that's what the result meant \nW hen asked if they think that May's plans respect the result of the referendum, 62 per cent of people replied positively - including 56 per of Remainers. \nThey do so grudgingly, with only 28 per cent of them being personally happy with the outcome. But they still accept that May's approach is respecting the referendum result that saw 52 per cent vote for Brexit . \nWhen it comes to the European Union's reaction to the British approach, just one in five think that it will agree to the deal. Chart - everyone thinks Mays plan respects referendum result People don't know where Labour stands on Brexit \n42 per cent of British people are not sure what Labour's priorities are when it comes to Brexit , according to YouGov polling. \nA lmost one in five people believe that the party's strategy is to get the best possible trading links with the EU, even if that means still following some EU rules and giving up some control of our borders. \nAn almost equal number of people think that Corbyn's party want to remain as close to the EU as possible and seek some form of associate membership, while 15 per cent of Brits believe it's to keep the country within the EU altogether. \nThe Labour leader warned that \"a Brexit that protects the bankers in the City and continues to give corporate handouts to the biggest companies is not good enough\" in his New Year's message, but failed to outline any detailed plans himself. Chart - Brexit polling, Labour While America is at the front of the line in terms of Brits' post-Brexit priorities \n41 per cent of British people rank the USA as the top priority when it comes to making post-Brexit trade deals, while a further 21 per cent ranked it as the second priority when asked to rank how high a priority countries should get out of five. \nT he European Union itself is the second most-valued trading partner, according to British people's preferences, although Brexiters would favour Australia. \nGiven the same ranking as the non-G7 Australia, British people said that the large economies of China, Canada and Japan should also be given high priority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:13:52.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
