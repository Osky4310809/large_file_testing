It's actually happening. \nGary Neville - perhaps the most famous, most respected football pundit in Britain - is ACTUALLY going on Arsenal Fan TV. \nAs hard as it is to believe, the men behind the infamous YouTube channel really have pulled off the biggest scoop in the history of angry Arsenal fans ranting online. \nAfter Neville called one Arsenal supporter \"embarrassing\" and an \"idiot\" during the defeat at Chelsea, Arsenal Fan TV invited him to come onto their show to discuss why he had been so critical of anti-Wenger fans. Incredibly, as this clip proves, the former Man United man has accepted the challenge: \nThe interview is set to hit the internet later this week. \nAnd we think we have figured out EXACTLY what will happen when it does… 1. Football fans will declare their admiration for Neville facing the mob diehard Arsenal fans \nWhen the idea of Neville appearing on the show was first mooted, no-one really believed it would happen. For starters, the Sky Sports pundit didn't need to make time in his busy schedule to sit down and talk to some potentially hostile Arsenal fans. \nThe fact that he has gone out of his way to have this debate is likely to earn him a lot of well-deserved credit. 2. Non-Arsenal fans will be left disgusted by Gooner Claude telling a man who won eight Premier Leagues, two Champions Leagues and 81 England caps that he doesn't know what he's talking about (Photo: YouTube/ArsenalFanTV) \nSadly inevitable. 3. Neville will ask someone to explain the logic that sees a fan take a preemptive banner slagging off the manager to a game… just in case Arsenal lose (Photo: Getty Images) \nThe story of Kane Hopps - the Arsenal fan Neville labelled \"an idiot\" for taking his 'Enough Is Enough' banner to Stamford Bridge - is how this all got started. \nPrepare for Neville to pull his brilliant 'eh?' face when they try to explain the logic behind that decision. 4. Neville to ask what \"Arsenal are sick, fam\" actually means \nSomething tells us G-Nev might not be down with the lingo often used on Arsenal Fan TV. \nIn fact, if anyone uses any of that Gooner slang, we might see him pull him that face again: 5. Someone to make a I'm-not-serious-but-actually-yes-I-am-a-bit-serious 'joke' about how Neville has always had it in for Arsenal (Photo: Getty) 6. The same person to follow this up by reminding him about Jose Antonio Reyes (Photo: AFP) \nArsenal fans have never forgiven Neville for booting Jose Antonio Reyes all over Old Trafford in October 2004, during the infamous match where Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten run came to an end. \nAfter Reyes had nutmegged him, Neville - by his own admission - set about bullying the Spaniard. As he said himself: \n“I knew above all that I had to get physical. I had to make Reyes lose his confidence. If there were question marks about him…they were over his temperament. It was my job to expose that weakness.” \nExpect that to come up at some point… 7.
