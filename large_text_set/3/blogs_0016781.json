It's all about adopting a new healthier lifestyle, that will allow you to lose weight and maintain it. But how do you do that?\nCertified dietitian Leslie Langevin, MS, RD, CD, of Whole Health Nutrition says the trick for losing weight and keeping it off is to \"think of food as fuel.\" If your body is the machine, think about feeding it premium, quality ingredients to allow it to run better.\nTypical American diets are heavy on refined carbs, refined sugars, and processed foods. When we eat these types of foods, we physically crave them more, not only because sugar is an addictive drug , but also because our bodies are starving for real nutrients. When we go on a diet and stop eating these high-sugar, refined, processed foods, we lose weight, but as soon as we start eating these foods again, we gain it all back, and maybe even more.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["http://www.wholehealthnutritionvt.com/", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/A587_22Wxi2COl5QUDAzME865OA/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/20/773/n/1922729/e2bc5666efc18dae_food-fuel.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-20T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:42:37.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
