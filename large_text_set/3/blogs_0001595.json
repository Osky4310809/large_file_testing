This is happening right across the country.” Protesters in London (Photo: Getty) \nHe added: “When patients are in pain, when they need an operation, it is heartbreaking to tell them their ­operation has been cancelled.” \nThis financial year is set to be the first ever when the NHS pledge of treating 92 per cent of patients within 18 weeks of referral will not have been met in ANY month. In December the national ­average was 89.7 per cent. \nKatherine Murphy, chief executive of The Patients Association, said: “We have noticed a clear trend over recent years in the increasing time people are waiting for operations. \n\"Not only can it be very stressful and painful when you are constantly waiting for surgery, but people can also fear losing further ­mobility and may find that they take longer to recover afterwards.” \nRichard Kerr, of the Royal College of Surgeons, warned: “Unless the NHS secures extra funding, waiting times, and the anxiety and discomfort they cause patients will only get worse.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:49:02.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
