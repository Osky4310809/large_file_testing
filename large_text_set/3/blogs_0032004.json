We’re not considering whose ox’ll be gored by this action or that action… We just don’t care, and we can’t care.” \nComey spoke of the “hyper-partisan environment” in America right now and made mention of his recent testimony to members of Congress, saying that “they see facts as to how it will affect ‘my side.'” \nAfter CNN played that clip tonight, Jeffrey Toobin reacted by saying, “What a bunch of sanctimonious nonsense.” \nYou can watch the clip above, via CNN. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:54:27.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
