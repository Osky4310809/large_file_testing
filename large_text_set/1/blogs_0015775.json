These events typically bring out a unique mix of compelled citizens and celebrities, and this inauguration was no different. \nWhile Trump is known for many things, some may know him from his dealings with professional wrestling over the years, including numerous appearances on WWE programming. He's held in high regard within the company, even being inducted into their hall of fame, and today two of the most prominent members of the organization showed up to support the newly elected President. A photo posted by Stephanie McMahon (@stephaniemcmahon) on Jan 20, 2017 at 10:32am PST \nThat would be the first couple of the Authority, otherwise known as executive vice president of talent, live events, and creative Triple H and chief brand officer Stephanie McMahon. Stephanie shared a picture of the two at the inauguration with the caption \"Regardless your politics, it was an honor to witness the peaceful transition of power as our 45th President was inaugurated. #ProudToBeAmerican\" \nThe McMahon family has more than just WWE ties to Trump these days, as Linda McMahon has been nominated by Trump to head the Small Business Administration in his new cabinet. \"Linda has a tremendous background and is widely recognized as one of the countryâ€™s top female executives advising businesses around the globe,\" Trump said in the announcement. \nIt remains to be seen if he ever makes another appearance on WWE television now that he's president of the United States, but you never know. With this rollercoaster of an election process, it just goes to show anything's possible, so maybe he'll show up on Smackdown Live or Monday Night RAW sooner than you think.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:57:39.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
