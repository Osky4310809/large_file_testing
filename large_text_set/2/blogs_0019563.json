A racist banner was also in the stands where Rads fans were standing, but was removed after the referee intervened. \nRelated: Aaron Carter Speaks Out On Being Attacked Over Racist Comment! \nLuiz played through the abuse until flipping the middle finger to the Rad supporters when Partizan won 1-0, which caused a scuffle between the players after the game. \nThe Brazilian player, who joined the team last year, said that he and his family felt at home in Serbia — which is why he couldn't hold in his tears after the game. \nHe said in a statement : \n\"I took 90 minutes of racist abuse and other insults from the terraces and thereafter I found myself in a cauldron of emotionless individuals who charged at me when they should have protected me. I want to forget this, refocus on football and urge everyone to say ‘No' to racism.\" \nThe Partizan team said they \"strongly condemn\" the racist abuse put on by fans, but the Serbian Football Association had a much stronger reaction to the incident. \nRelated: Breitbart News Has Been Losing A Shit Ton Of Advertisers! \nOn Monday, the association suspended Rad's stadium in Belgrade until further notice due to the fans' behavior. League commissioner Vladimir Bulatovic said in a statement: \n\"Due to the misbehavior of their fans who racially insulted a player, Rad's stadium has been suspended until the Serbian Football Association (FSS) passes a verdict. The suspension means no first division games will be played at the venue until a final decision is made and disciplinary proceedings have been opened against all parties involved in the incident.\" \nSerbian fans have become notorious for racism against black players, as Rad supporters are known for their nationalist far-right wing behavior. Who knew they had so much in common with Donald Trump 's key advisors? \nHowever, it's great to know the league is taking this abuse seriously.
