That could happen as soon as 2021.\" That prediction might seem like a long shot in light of recent headlines, but Troy Dayton, co-founder and CEO of cannabis investment and research firm Arcview Group, thinks it could happen – even if that's \"the soonest I can imagine.\" (See also, The Economic Benefits of Legalizing Marijuana . ) \nA few months ago, cannabis' trajectory towards legalization seemed relatively clear cut. Colorado, Oregon and Alaska had joined Washington in permitting recreational sales, and swathes of the country were loosening up on medical use. As a Republican presidential candidate, Trump went on Fox News in February 2016 to defend medical use ( \"I'm in favor of it 100%\" ), and while he didn't appear to be totally sold on recreational use, he did tell a rally in Nevada in 2015, \"I really believe we should leave it up to the states.\" \nElection Day saw California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada become legal markets. But it also saw Trump win the White House, and his choice of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General – announced November 18 – was heavy news for the growing ranks of state-legal, federally tolerated cannabis entrepreneurs, investors and consumers. A veteran of the drug war, Sessions appeared ready to resume the U.S.'s fight against what remains on the federal books as a Schedule I drug: a substance with \"high potential for abuse\" and \"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\" All that stood in Sessions' way was a 2013 Department of Justice memo deferring to states on the issue – guidance that Sessions could theoretically scrap over breakfast. Graphiq \n\"Sessions is certainly a risk for the cannabis industry,\" Dayton told Investopedia by phone Thursday, \"there's no doubt. That being said, I think the way the media's been playing it is perhaps overblown.\" He pointed to what Sessions had told a talk radio host the previous week (tellingly, he could rattle off the exact quote): \"Marijuana is against federal law, and that applies in states where they may have repealed their own anti-marijuana laws.\" (See also, What Will Jeff Sessions Mean for the Marijuana Industry . ) \n\"He's simply stating a fact,\" Dayton says, recalling that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch said almost the same thing during her confirmation hearings in January 2015. \"Of course Sessions has some ridiculous ideas about cannabis,\" he adds, mentioning the Attorney General's comment on Wednesday that the drug is \"only slightly less awful than heroin.\" Yet minutes after that remark, in response to questions from reporters, Sessions referred to \"much\" of the 2013 DOJ memorandum as \"valid,\" adding, \"we're not able to go into a state and pick up the work that police and sheriffs have been doing for decades.\" In Dayton's reading, Sessions \"said they're not going to have a crackdown.\" \nLimited DOJ resources are not the only reason Dayton is skeptical of a looming crackdown. People like pot. \"If the Trump administration is looking for a way to be less popular, going after cannabis would be a great way to do that.\" Surveys conducted by Gallup have shown that the proportion of respondents favoring legal weed rose from 31% in 2000 to 60% in 2016. States with legal markets, meanwhile, are benefiting from job creation and increased tax revenue, says Dayton. \nCongress has already started to weigh in on the issue. The Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, which passed in 2014 after 11 years and six failed attempts, prevents the DOJ from spending federal funds to interfere with states' enforcement of medical marijuana laws. The provision must be re-approved every fiscal year, however, making it vulnerable. But Dayton is still sanguine: \"I think it's fairly likely that before the end of the year those protections will be extended to cover adult use states.\" (See also, Top 4 Medicinal Marijuana Stocks to Watch for 2017 . ) Legal by 2021? \nFull legalization at the federal level could take a bit longer. \"I don't think we're going to see that in the short run,\" Dayton says, though he thinks it could happen as soon as 2021. Asked whether he picked that date because a new president could potentially be taking office, he said yes, but \"it's also about the makeup of the Congress. You know Congress is always the last body to do anything, so you're going to need a lot more pressure from the states.\" \nIn the meantime, Dayton expects improvement on other fronts. First, in the sheer size of the legal market. Arcview projects legal spending to grow at a compound annual rate of 26%, from $6.9 billion in 2016 to $21.6 billion in 2021. Most of this growth will occur in recreational markets, which are expected to overtake medical ones in 2019. (See also, Legal Weed Market to Triple in 5 Years . ) \nDayton also expects regulatory improvement. Banks' reluctance to cater to the cannabis industry has made life difficult for entrepreneurs, not least because the resulting piles of cash have proved attractive to thieves. According to Arcview's latest \"State of Legal Marijuana Markets\" report, the number of banks and credit unions working with cannabis businesses jumped from 51 in 2014 to 301 in 2016 – meaning that 11,653 still don't. The IRS' stance on cannabis also hurts businesses: because section 280E of the tax code prohibits taking expenses related to \"trafficking in controlled substances,\" Arcview's report says that cannabis businesses routinely pay 70% effective tax rates. \n\"I think we'll see some movement on banking,\" Dayton told Investopedia. \"We'll probably see some movement on 280E IRS laws, we'll see a continuation of the tying of the Justice Department's hands, we'll see more states pass laws over the coming years.\" \nIn other words, does it not matter that the DOJ may be less friendly to cannabis than under Obama? Not quite. One consequence, Dayton says, is that big institutional investors \"that were kind of thinking about getting in, I think they might wait it out to see what comes of it.\" For all the difficulties the uncertain legal and regulatory environment creates, however, it also creates opportunities. \"The reasons why it's not treated like other industries are also creating a barrier to entry to people who don't want to mess around with all of the ways in which it's different,\" says Dayton. \"But that's an opportunity for people who want to be in that mix.\" (See also, Medical Marijuana ETF to Debut Soon . ) Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:57:14.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
