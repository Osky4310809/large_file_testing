Firstly, they argued that the injunction should only apply to the twelve states, including Texas, which had filed a lawsuit against the guidance in the first place. That way, the guidance would still stand for the other 38 states. A hearing on this matter, including oral arguments, was scheduled for Tuesday, February 14, but the Justice Department and the twelve states filed a joint motion to cancel the hearing. “The parties are currently considering how to best proceed in this appeal,” it read.\nSince the injunction was already in place, this move has no immediate policy effect, but it signals that Jeff Sessions is exactly what his opponents accused him of being. “Sessions will not be an advocate for the voiceless and vulnerable,” said Senator Kamala Harris. “I have no confidence that Senator Sessions will be an independent attorney general and not an arm of the White House,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein. And Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed to his “career [that] is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants and the rule of law.”\nSo far, so accurate.\n(Via The Slot , Department of Justice , and CNN International ; image via Shutterstock)\nWant more stories like this?
