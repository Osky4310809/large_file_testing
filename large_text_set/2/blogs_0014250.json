Runoff from its snowpack normally supplies about a third of the state's water. \nMeteorologists describe the \"bombogenesis\" as an intense extra-tropical cyclonic low-pressure area, or \"a weather bomb\". \n\"The storm looks to be the strongest storm to hit southwest California this season,\" the National Weather Service said. \n\"It is likely the strongest within the last six years and possibly even as far back as December 2004 or January 1995.\" Image copyright AP Image caption A large eucalyptus tree toppled on to a carport in Goleta \nGusts of 87mph (140km/h) were reported on the Big Sur scenic coastal highway. \nRyan Maue, a meteorologist for WeatherBell Analytics, told the Los Angeles Times that 10 trillion gallons of rain would fall on California in the next week, enough to power Niagara Falls for 154 days.
