Chloe says Calum made her \"feel like a woman\" (Photo: Channel 5) They flirted during their time in the house (Photo: Channel 5) \nSpeaking to OK! magazine, he said: \"I was quite embarrassed because I didn't really know how to take most of it. I was flattered but when you know you're being watched and some people are very full on, it makes it slightly awkward.\" \nHowever, the heartthrob was open to the idea of striking up a romance with another housemate when he went into the abode but abruptly changed his mind. \nHe explained to the publication: \"I'm a single guy and I went in there totally open to flirt. But, realistically, I had more important things personally that I wanted to experience and romance wasn't one of them on that show. There was some flirting, but I knew straight away that it wasn't going to be romance for me.\" Jessica enjoyed giving Calum a massage (Photo: Channel 5) They got close in the house (Photo: Channel 5) \nPrior to entering the house, Calum - who is the son of the late George Best - was dating Lindsey Pelas but they weren't in a loyal relationship because she was happy for him to get with any girls in there if it helped him to come out the winner. \nShe said previously: \"We say that we're dating but it's a weird situation because of the show. He can't be in a full-time committed relationship and I get that, but also I'm not dating anyone else because I don't think he'd like that. I'd say we're unfinished.\" \nHowever, his tactics didn't go according to plan as he was given the boot from the infamous abode after he failed to pull in enough public votes.
