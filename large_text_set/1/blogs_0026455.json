It is very mysterious, because we know next to nothing about it. Last summer the school’s houses were revealed — Thunderbird, Horned Serpent, Pukwudgie, and Wampus — and we know it’s located in Massachusetts . And…that’s about it. Those hoping to catch a glimpse of a wizarding school in Fantastic Beasts were sorely disappointed.\nHow are we supposed to swoon over a school (we never got acceptance letters to) if we don’t actually see it?? With still four more Fantastic Beasts movies left to go, we’ll catch a glimpse of the school eventually. For now, we’ll just take this delightful deleted scene from the movie, where Tina and Queenie launch into the Ilvermorny school song. Let’s just say this song is a LOT more organized than the Hogwarts School song .\n& A new #FantasticBeasts deleted scene was released at #HPCelebration.\nNai-post ni Fantastic Beasts noong Linggo, Enero 29, 2017 This scene is cut from the part of the movie were everyone has ventured inside Newt’s magical suitcase to check out some fantastic beasts IRL. Queenie has just brought up Leta (and Newt doesn’t want to talk about her), when Tina comes in and asks what they’re talking about. Quick to respond, Queenie says “school.” In the movie, this is actually where the scene cuts. This deleted continues on with their talk about school, and provides us with the best wizarding school song we’ve ever heard.\nQueenie is so into this song, and you can kinda see Tina roll her eyes as soon as she starts singing. We’re kinda rolling our eyes, too, because the lyrics go like, “ Ilvermorny, Massachusetts, we choo-choose it, we choo-choose it ” and aww, that’s cute. Not exactly a fight song, but it works.\nThe school song also teaches us a little bit about the history of the school, which will have to hold us over until we actually get to see inside the campus (Please let the Wampus common room be cool, please let the Wampus common room be cool…)\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:34:22.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
