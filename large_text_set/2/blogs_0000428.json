That’s what we’re honing in on; it’s the pursuit, the effort, the passion, the drive, the hard work, the ambition, that’s really what this is about more than anything else.” \nAsked if the commercial was a political statement against President Donald Trump’s hardline stance on immigration and border control, the vp alleged that was not their intent. \n“There’s really no correlation with anything else that’s happening in the country,” Marques says. “We believe this is a universal story that is very relevant today because probably more than any other period in history today the world pulls you in different directions, and it’s never been harder to stick to your guns.” \nAdWeek reports the AB InBev subsidiary is spending about $15 million producing and promoting the ad, which they hope will re-crown them the “King of Beers.” \nOn a side note Budweiser , Anheuser-Busch’s flagship lager beer, receives an “awful” rating of 58 out of 100 on the online beer review site BeerAdvocate.com .
