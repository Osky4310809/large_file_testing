The ad depicted scenes of people all over the country enjoying themselves, set to a multilingual version of \"America the Beautiful.\"\nToday millions cheer together, because together is beautiful. #AmericaIsBeautiful pic.twitter.com/z65LimssjD \n— Coca-Cola (@CocaCola) February 5, 2017 \nThis was apparently enough to really upset some people on Twitter. The hashtag #BoycottCoke took off immediately among users complaining that the company was getting too political.\nIt's worth noting that the ad was actually recycled from a campaign that ran in 2014.\n\"The premise of ‘It’s Beautiful’ can be simply stated: America is beautiful and Coca-Cola is for everyone,\" the company said in a statement at the time.\nThrowback to this 2012 Trump tweet... (h/t @hershy718 ) https://t.co/OTlYnen7rg \n— Rebecca Berg (@rebeccagberg) February 6, 2017 \nThese extreme reactions to relatively innocuous ads have been something of a running theme this Super Bowl thanks to our intense political climate. \nBudweiser's focus on its immigrant founder also drew angry reactions, despite the fact the beer brand planned the ad months ago and didn't intend it to be a political statement. People were also mad online because of an Audi commercial that called for equal pay for women.\nBONUS: These are the most talked about Super Bowl LI ads that you won't want to miss", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:07:18.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
