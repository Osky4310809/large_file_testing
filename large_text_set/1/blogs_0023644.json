(Photo: Michael Madrid-USA TODAY Sports) \nWelcome to FTW Explains, where FTW Explains some stuff that's going on in the world. You might have heard German golfer Bernhard Langer's name come up recently in political stories. You might have heard that President Trump used a story he says Langer told him about Election Day as evidence of voter fraud. You might have read two sentences ago that Langer is German. You might be confused. Here's the deal. So what's going on here? \nPresident Trump had a session with congressmen and others Monday in an introductory capacity. One of the topics he talked about was his insistence on the existence of unproven voter fraud in an election he won. And he had a weird specific example to pull, according to three witnesses' descriptions to The New York Times : \n(Langer) was standing in line at a polling place near his home in Florida on Election Day, the president explained, when an official informed Mr. Langer he would not be able to vote. \nAhead of and behind Mr. Langer were voters who did not look as if they should be allowed to vote, Mr. Trump said, according to the staff members - but they were nonetheless permitted to cast provisional ballots. The president threw out the names of Latin American countries that the voters might have come from. Why couldn't Langer vote? \nWell, the Times contacted his daughter to discover that he's both not a citizen and not a friend of Trump's, though the president described him as such. How did Trump hear about it? \nThe Times reports that Langer ran into Trump at a Florida golf course. Who is Bernhard Langer anyway? \nHe is a really great golfer, probably the best ever from Germany. Langer is second in European Tour history with 42 victories and second in Champions Tour history with another 30. He's 59 and still great for his age - he won the Champions Tour last year . He's also, again, German. So what About Trump's fake voter claims?
