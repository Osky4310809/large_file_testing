Four people were shot, including rapper Troy Ave, and his bodyguard Ronald “Banga” McPhatter, who was killed. According to a New York Daily News report from last year, McPhatter’s brother accused Taxstone of killing his sibling before dropping the gun that Ave retrieved and used to return fire. \nAve was indicted last June on attempted murder charges related to the shooting and posted a $500,000 bond last July. He claims he acted in self-defense. \nTaxstone’s legal team has yet to address the arrest to the public.
