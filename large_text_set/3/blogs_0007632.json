They needn’t worry, because the wonderteen was there. Advertisement \nDortmund scored the leveler in just the fourth minute, on a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang header. He was assisted by 18-year-old American attacking midfielder Christian Pulisic, who flicked a corner to the unmarked Aubameyang on the far post. \nDortmund relentlessly attacked for the rest of the half—Pulisic wasn’t far off from setting up two more goals—but couldn’t convert. So in the second half Pulisic decided to do it himself, scoring the goal that would ultimately see Dortmund through to the quarterfinals with a lovely chip over Benfica keeper Ederson. \nAnd just for good measure, after Dortmund scored a third, Pulisic got his second assist of the night with a lovely slide-rule ball past three Benfica defenders to a waiting Aubameyang, for a final score of 4-0, with Pulisic contributing a goal and two assists. \nStarting for an injured Marco Reus, preferred to André Schürrle and Shinji Kagawa, and playing in the biggest match of his life, Pulisic submitted the best performance of his life. Alongside Aubameyang he was a step or two better than every other player on the pitch, and his goal made him just the seventh American to ever score in the Champions League (and I believe the first-ever to score in the knockout rounds, but don’t quote me). Advertisement Advertisement \nWe said it back in September, but it bares repeating. Christian Pulisic isn’t the future. For both Borussia Dortmund and the United State’s Men’s National Team, he is the immediate present. \n[FS2]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:14:39.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
