With an image of Janelle Monae that she posted on Monday, Mendes both complimented Monae’s style prowess while giving a subtle nod to Gosling’s sweet speech with a caption that read, “Obviously this wasn’t my favorite moment of the night….But it was definitely my favorite style moment of the night.”\nSee the full post below.\nObviously this wasn't my favorite moment of the night….But it was definitely my favorite style moment of the night. The stunning and talented @janellemonae is killing me with this look. So so so beautiful ❤ #goldenglobes \nA photo posted by Eva Mendes (@evamendes) on Jan 9, 2017 at 12:32pm PST \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T19:47:09.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
