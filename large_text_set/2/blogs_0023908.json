He can still be a gifted, goalscoring midfielder without trying to chop an opponent in half.

He let down himself, his manager and his team when they needed him.\" \nGent's Dejaegere revealed Alli apologised for the foul after the match. \n\"Dele Alli just said sorry to me and that's nice from him, he's a professional,\" Dejaegere said. \n\"We're okay, it's football. I saw the images and it could have been much worse. I don't think he meant it because he came to apologise himself.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T18:19:22.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
