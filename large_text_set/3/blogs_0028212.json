Perkins, 39, of Frisco, had been on trial for two weeks on charges that he possessed a total of five videos on his device, which had been seized and searched at JFK Airport last April, after he co-piloted a Delta Airlines flight from Montreal.\nPerkins had argued that he’d only purchased the iPad — used, and from a Texas pawn shop — two weeks prior to his arrest, and that prosecutors could not conclusively prove the images had been uploaded since then.\nUltimately, jurors were able to agree that two of the videos, which depicted pre-pubescent girls, were possessed by Perkins. He was acquitted of possessing the other three videos.\n“He had bought the iPad at a pawn shop and used it only two weeks before — in my view — he was illegally searched at the airport,” defense lawyer Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma told The Post after the verdict.\n“The images were found deep in the file system of the iPad,” he added. “We argued it was unclear when they were put on the iPad.”\nPerkins was originally implicated after Dallas-based investigators for Homeland Security’s Child Exploitation Group suspected that child porn was being transmitted to an IP address located in a home in nearby Richardson.\nInvestigators found nothing incriminating at the home, which belonged to Perkins’ father. But they learned that the son had been using the WiFi connection there.\nPerkins had been free on $50,000 bail, but was ordered remanded by the trial judge, Queens Supreme Court Justice Richard Buchter, pending a sentencing set for April 6.\nHe faces a minimum of one-to-three years prison, and a maximum of 2 1/3-to-seven years.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:22:08.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
