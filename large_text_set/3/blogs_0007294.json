You know why? They'd already been given the penalty, wwhih was a perfectly valid penalty, no-one disputes that, which they scored. That made it 6-2 on aggregate. The sending off [of Laurent Koscielny] had nothing to do with it,\" he monologued. Piers ranted about Arsenal's performance (Photo: ITV) He became irate at the suggestion his favourite club always flounder at this point in the season (Photo: ITV) \n\"Ridiculous.

But he's had his time.\" \nBut Sean was determined to have the last word, pointing out: \"Arsenal do tend to go out at this stage of the season.\" Sean was determined to have the last word (Photo: ITV) \n\"Ahahahaha,\" said Piers sarcastically, before reaching for his pen. \nAs he launched it across the studio, Sean had to duck to avoid it hitting him. \n\"He's throwing pens at me,\" he said, disbelievingly. He had to duck as Piers' pen whistled through the air (Photo: ITV) \n\"Get him out of here. Security!\" added Piers. \nThe irate presenter struggled to control his temper later on in the programme when the sexist MEP Janusz Korwin-Mikke was brought on to defend his comments about women. \nThe Polish politician hit headlines this week after telling the European parliament that women weren't deserving of equal pay because they are \"weaker, smaller and less intelligent\". \nKorwin-Mikke refused to apologise for his outdated views on GMB, prompting Piers to brand him a \"horrendous sexiest pig\" and \"incredibly stupid\".
