PAGASA PHOTO \nParts of the country will continue to be cloudy with rain and isolated thunderstorms still due to a trough of a low pressure area, affecting the eastern section of Mindanao and the north east monsoon affecting Luzon and Eastern Visayas, the state weather bureau said on Monday. \nADVERTISEMENT \nThe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), in its 5 a.m. bulletin, said the Caraga and Davao regions would experience cloudy skies with light to moderate rainshowes and isolated thunderstorms. \nIt will also be cloudy with light rain over the regions of Cagayan Valley, Bicol, Eastern and Central Visayas and the provinces of Aurora and Quezon, Pagasa said. \nMetro Manila and the rest of the country, meanwhile, will be partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms. \nThe weather bureau said moderate to strong winds blowing from the northeast will prevail over Luzon and the eastern section of Visayas and of Mindanao. The coastal waters along these areas, it said, will be moderate to rough. \nElsewhere, Pagasa said, winds will be light to moderate coming from the northeast with slight to moderate seas.
