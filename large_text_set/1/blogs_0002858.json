Then take half the clothes and twice the money,” said the author Susan Heller. \nIf you’re planning to travel more in 2017 then you probably assume it’s a New Year’s Resolution that’s going to cost you. \nBut there are ways to travel more on a shoestring budget – and here are our top tips… 1. Book at the right time Want to save - then set at least one reminder \nYou might think that planning your trip early is the best way to get the cheapest tickets, but that’s not always true. In fact, research from airfare comparison website Skyscanner.com suggests that the cheapest time to book a flight into Europe is five weeks before the journey. \nIf it’s train tickets that you want then there are usually a handful of cheap seats for each journey and these can be released about 12 weeks before the day of travel. \nYou can sign up to receive alerts via websites like thetrainline.com. Here's how to save more money on train tickets . \nAnd it goes without saying that if you’re childfree then booking travel during term time can make for a much cheaper (and probably quieter) trip. \nOf course, if all you want is an adventure and you’re not fussy where you go then there may be some real travel bargains available at the very last minute.

Ditch hotels Sleeping bags not required (although might help, if you're OK with them) \nIf you’re really travelling for the experience then you may not need a dedicated hotel room, with individually wrapped soaps and a hefty bill. \nIn fact, staying in people’s homes can be a far cheaper and more genuine way to experience a country. It can also mean you get a local’s perspective on the best value places to see, which can save you a packet. \nSome people advertise their homes for bed-and-breakfast, others simply advertise a sofa bed via websites like Airbnb. 3. Buy travel insurance 'As she fell backwards through the air, Mary idly wondered where her travel insurance forms were...' \nNot to be too boring when you’re planning your wild adventure, but buying travel insurance is essential. \nIf you break your leg halfway up a mountain then you really don’t want to be left footing the bill for getting helicoptered to hospital. \nAnd don’t assume you can rely on your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). You should get one before heading into mainland Europe – they are free and entitle you to receive state medical care - but in some countries patients are expected to pay towards their treatment. \nNot only that, but your EHIC won’t cover the cost of mountain rescue, lost baggage or being flown back to the UK. Insurance is a must. Here's our guide to picking the right policy for you .

Buy a guide book You'd be amazed what you find in side streets, that is unless you have a guide book to tell you... \nWandering around a strange city with no real plans can be very expensive, so it’s often worth investing in a guide book. \nThe very best guides will tell you how expensive various restaurants, attractions and bars are, helping you to avoid the money pits and sample the real culture. \nAnd remember that it’s worth prioritising experiences you can’t get at home. There are fancy restaurants back in the UK, don’t waste money on generic luxuries. 5. Travel with a partner If for no other reason than to have someone to talk to in the queues \nOften a double room costs just a little more than a single, while splitting the cost of taxis, guidebooks and food can bring the cost per person right down. \nNot only that, but it can be safer to travel with someone you trust to watch your back and help keep an eye on your stuff. Just be sure your travel partner is someone you actually enjoy being around, because you’re going to see a heck of a lot of each other. \nAnd you can save money on shorter holidays as well as longer trips with our three-step plan to paying less for trips abroad .
