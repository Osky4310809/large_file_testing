Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nChelsea are trying to rush through a deal for Schalke defender Sead Kolasinac after Branislav Ivanovic agreed to join Zenit St Petersburg. \nBlues boss Antonio Conte is trying to gazump former club Juventus in the battle to sign the Schalke left back. \nChelsea have granted Ivanovic a free transfer and the long-serving defender has now agreed a two and a half year contract at Zenit. \nKolasinac has won 17 caps for Bosnia, having previously played at Under-20 level for Germany, and can play at left back or centre back. \nKolasinac is out of contract in the summer and therefore Schalke are ready to cut their losses and sell before the end of the window.

He’s 32 and, I think, he can play for many (more) years. \n“He's able to continue his career in the right way at the top level, yes. It's important also to respect the decision of the player, above all for this type of player - a legend of the club. \n“If you are not playing a lot, you can decide to go in another team. But I have great respect for him and for this type of player. \n“When you start the season, working with a squad and a group of players, for sure you try to create a link between the players and my staff and me. For sure, we are sorry if someone decides to go away.

Also for Mikel. But we know this is football, and we are prepared for every situation.” \nChelsea could yet sign Celtic’s keeper Craig Gordon as they look for a replacement for Asmir Begovic who is a £10m target for Bournemouth. \nBut unless they can find a replacement and with the clock ticking, it looks increasingly likely that Begovic could stay. \nConte added: “Until now, I haven't news about Asmir. I think we have to wait until tomorrow, and we'll see the situation then. \n\"But the situation is the same: Asmir wants to go to play because he wants to play every game, but also Asmir knows really well our situation. \n“If we are able to find a good replacement, he'll go. Otherwise, he'll stay with us and fight until the end with the other teams to win the title and find a place as champions.” poll loading Would Sead Kolasinac be a good signing for Chelsea? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T19:17:33.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
