But fans are thrilled to discover he‚Äôs also in possession of an unexpected talent: a singing voice worthy of the stage. Gyllenhaal is taking to Broadway for the Sondheim musical Sunday in the Park with George , opening later this month , and he released a teaser video of his rehearsal in which he belts out the haunting, thoughtful tune ‚ÄúFinishing the Hat.‚Äù It nabbed over half a million views in less than a day.\nGyllenhaal had noted director Cary Fukunaga (of True Detective and Beasts of No Nation ) on hand during rehearsal, so the casual backstage video is actually more of a polished clip than you might expect. And fans (including fellow actor Ryan Reynolds) have plenty of praise for Gyllenhaal‚Äôs singing‚Äîwhich is buttery and on-tune, even during the song‚Äôs tricky key changes.\nMe: I should probably stop repeatedly watching the video of Jake Gyllenhaal singing.\nInner Me: pic.twitter.com/9K6wVoq2E6 \n‚Äî Frances D White (@FrancesDarvell) February 8, 2017 \ngive me a jake gyllenhaal movie musical now https://t.co/jNiPtGJitx \n‚Äî Jackson McHenry (@McHenryJD) February 7, 2017 \nI'm truly shocked!Jake Gyllenhaal,one of the best actors of his generation,good looking and funny, can sing pretty amazing.So shocked!\n‚Äî ‚ö°Ô∏è (@icuddlyharry) February 8, 2017 \nHave you heard Jake Gyllenhaal sing?? üé∂üòçüò± https://t.co/VcytPmvJYC \n‚Äî Emmett Chapman (@EmmettChapmanUK) February 8, 2017 \njake gyllenhaal singing is the best thing what has happened to me since the beginning of this year, i couldn't be more thankful\n‚Äî xx (@leemcquxxn) February 8, 2017 \nSo jake gyllenhaal can sing and I don't think I can live anymore\n‚Äî nathalia (@natsoto3) February 8, 2017 \nI've watched Jake Gyllenhaal sing \"Finishing The Hat\" 17 times now, someone please tell Brian I need these tix and ticket to NY for vday\n‚Äî Katherinedp (@katherinedp) February 8, 2017 \nExcuse me while I just drool over the Jake Gyllenhaal Sunday in the Park video all day.
