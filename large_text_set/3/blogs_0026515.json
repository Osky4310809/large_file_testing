And I was always the person that was hiding from the cameras and not comfortable with that. \n\"The world of Metallica, it's fairly transparent, and people do see a lot more than with other bands. I think that's good for Metallica - to be able to open those doors and have people feel comfortable with us is a very cool thing.\" \nThe bassist added: \"But sometimes, I feel people get so comfortable with us that they think they can dictate what we're supposed to do. \n\"I made a documentary about Jaco Pastorius [in 2014, titled 'Jaco'], who was my favorite bass player growing up. It took me six years, every single day, it was the most difficult creative thing I ever did in my life - I'm very proud of it. \n\"But I remember at one point there was some connection with Metallica fans. Some people were very supportive, but I was surprised by how many people were unsupportive. They were almost upset. 'How dare he do this film about whatever?!' It didn't matter who it was about, they were just upset. \n\"The bottom line is - we're all individuals, we're a part of a band and a family and we support each other, whether it's family or whatever. \n\"If James is designing custom cars, I support him; I'm like, 'Yeah!' I check out what he's doing, I'm fascinated, he's great at it. When Kirk's involved with his horror collection and festival, which is really cool, we support each other. \n\"But sometimes, it's true, the fans get upset. They were mad we made an album with Lou Reed [2011's ' Lulu ']. At the end of the day, it's creative freedom, it's important to us. Metallica's important to us, but at the same time, we have our lives and we have to let that energy and passion out. Passion's important. \n\"Sometimes it gets a little intense, but you gotta live your life.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:20:22.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
