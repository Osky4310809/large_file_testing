King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 4 hours ago 5 Dave Mustaine said that following his recent move to Nashville, TN, not only did he discover that the city is packed with highly skilled musicians, but many of them seem to be metal guys who switched to country because they couldn't land a gig in their genre of choice.Megadeth frontman told Q104.3 : \"Metal guys, they're pretty advanced with their playing. And when you watch country players, a lot of times they're metal players that couldn't get a gig so they settled for country.\"Every single [country] band that I've met, any of the guitar players are like, 'Oh man, I'm a huge fan of yours!' It's like, 'What?'\"Some of the performers too, they're big fans, they love metal music. I'm excited about that because I like their music; it's not the music I would want to have with me on a desert island because I'm a metal guy, but I totally appreciate and respect the music.\"And my daughter's pursuing a country music career in Nashville, she's very successful. I've met a lot of these people. The guy who produced couple of our biggest records [1997's ' Cryptic Writings ' and 1999's ' Risk '] - Dann Huff - just won Producer of the Year this year for the CMTs [fan-voted awards show for country music videos and television performances hosted since 1967].\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:03:13.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
