It's time to battle the Droughtlander! We know that many fans are particularly parched during this extended Outlander hiatus , but we want to offer you a small sip of season three secrets. Last December, we at ET traveled all the way over to Outlander 's Scotland-based sets and were treated to a special behind-the-scenes tour of the series awesomely intimidating armoury -- and now we're sharing that experience with you, plus an exclusive first-look at season three footage! EXCLUSIVE: 'Outlander' Star Caitriona Balfe Adorably Apologizes for 'Longer' Season 3 Hiatus Outlander 's official armourer, Jim Elliot , has been the weapons props master since 2014 and has been a key factor in bringing those action-packed battle scenes to life. Elliot admitted that it was a bit of a \"daunting\" task to prepare for season three's Battle of Culloden because it’s one of the biggest (and most highly anticipated!) moments the series has had. Photo: ET \"We had four trucks of weapons [for the Battle of Culloden,]\" Elliot explained. \"Seven hundred weapons on a daily basis for two weeks [shooting on the field] and then picks-ups and green screens. It was long days, but enjoyable and I hope it looks great on screen.\" Outlander 's armoury walls are covered with a massive collection of every weapon imaginable including broadswords, axes, spears and targes, the distinctive circular shields used by Jacobites. The guns are safely under lock and key in nearby containers. WATCH: Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe Answer 'Outlander' Fan Questions! Photo: ET The massive room is located within the Outlander soundstage in Glasgow, Scotland just outside the doors that lead to the lavish set of the Fraser's Lallybroch home. (Pssst! The armoury is also close to another set that was created just for season three, but we're going to stay tight-lipped on that one for now…) Press play on our exclusive tour above to get a glimpse at the Scottish broadsword they had custom-made for Sam Heughan , plus some special season three sneak peeks of Rupert's ax from the Battle of Culloden and cave-dwelling Jamie's bow and arrow! Season three of Outlander will premiere in September 2017 on Starz. Thirsty for more Outlander goodies? Watch our exclusive interview with Caitriona Balfe below to get the inside scoop on the \"great reunion\" between Jamie and Claire in season three!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:21:17.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
