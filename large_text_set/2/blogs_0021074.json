Dressed Stars at the 2017 Oscars by Desiree Murphy 9:55   Frazer Harrison/Getty Images It was a night of fierce fashion at the 89th Annual Academy Awards! In celebration of the grand finale of awards shows, Hollywood's brightest stars brought their A-game with their red carpet looks . And while most looked stunning at Los Angeles' Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood & Highland center, there were a few celebrities who rocked far less favorable ensembles. Now, ET's rounded up our favorite (and not so favorite!) outfits from the star-studded fÃªte. WATCH: 2017 Oscars -- See Who Won! Unsurprisingly topping off ET's Best Dressed List , the always stylish Emma Stone , who dazzled in Tiffany & Co. jewels and a gold Givenchy Haute Couture gown custom-designed by Riccardo Tisci. The dress' hue perfectly complemented the shiny statuette she accepted for Best Actress for her portrayal of Mia in La La Land . Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images Hidden Figures star Taraji P. Henson put on a leggy display, sporting an off-the-shoulder navy velvet gown with a thigh-high slit. Her Nirav Modi jewels, black clutch and strappy heels gave the ensemble an extra elegant vibe. Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Henson's co-star, Janelle Monae , looked equally fabulous, donning the most head-turning look of the night -- a bold black-and-silver ball gown! \"[It's] Elie Saab couture,\" she told ET on the red carpet. \"Forever Mark on the fingers and ears. And I'm just so happy to be here.\" Though she admitted getting in the car wasn't very easy. \"I'm an android and I have secret ways of getting in places smoothly,\" she joked. Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images As for fashion missteps, we were a bit surprised by Scarlett Johansson's get-up, as we expected her to land a spot on our coveted Best Dressed list. The printed Alaia gown she donned felt a bit busy with her spiked belt and silver bracelets. Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images While Naomie Harris was totally on-trend with all the white we saw on the red carpet, the Moonlight star's Calvin Klein dress felt a bit too informal for such a glamorous event. Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Seemingly taking a style cue from all the stunning metallic outfits we've seen this awards season, Fifty Shades Darker star Dakota Johnson attempted to master gold. But her Gucci dress, which featured an enormous bow at the waist and appeared to be wrinkled, wasn't our favorite.
