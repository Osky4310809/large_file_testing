So if you just mute them, they think you are still following them, but you don’t actually see their tweets.” \nStephen Colbert pointed out the absurdity in Cooper, a newsman, having to mute the president because of his outlandish, obnoxious statements. “You wouldn’t have muted Ike,” Colbert said. \nRegardless, Cooper did say that Trump’s Twitter presence is valuable. \n“This is like a real-time seismograph in the inner workings of the president’s head, and it’s fascinating,” he said. “He’s an emotional seismograph. He’s like a live-wire of emotion.” \nColbert switched the topic to Cooper’s employer, CNN, also known as “fake news,” according to the president. Colbert said it was somewhat peculiar that Trump has singled out CNN out of all the networks. “You were like the manilla folder of news,” he said. \nCooper said that this hostile treatment was not necessarily new. He said that he “did not have a great relationship” with the Obama White House. “I didn’t really have any relationship,” he said. \n“I also don’t want to have a relationship with these people,” he continued. “I interviewed Kellyanne Conway a couple weeks ago, probably, maybe my last interview with her ever. I don’t know. I am not saying anything bad about her. I just haven’t interviewed her since. At one point of the interview she said, ‘We might have to rethink our relationship.’ I don’t want to have a relationship with you,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:18:24.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
