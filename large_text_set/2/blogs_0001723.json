Animal Feelings —and Nomi Ruiz today shared a pensive, introverted cover of Ariana Grande's 2016 single \"Into You,\" and announced their forthcoming debut LP Love Luxury . Reinterpreting the original to emphasize a more delicate and somber side of desire, the track follows their ecstatically lush collaborative track \"Chemical Love,\" released last year. \nRuiz, who was a frontwoman for the original Hercules and Love Affair lineup, told THUMP over email about how the song relates to the rest of her material with Chang. \"'Into You' is a great example of the sound we've cultivated on our upcoming album Love Luxury ,\" she said. \"It's the introduction to a longer story of lust, longing, and being consumed by your muse.\" \nChang told us about the decision-making behind their version of Grande's track. \"I love the fun and sexy nature of the original song,\" he said. \"I thought it could be fun to work on a new version with Nomi to emphasize it more as a sensory experience. Once we sat down and played around with it we came up with what we thought was a more sensual version.\" \nLove Luxury will be released sometime in 2017, exact date TBD. \nFollow Alexander on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:42:37.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
