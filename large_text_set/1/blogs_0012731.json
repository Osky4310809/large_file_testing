A Police Officer's Night Before Christmas \nThis viral parody of Clement Clarke Moore's famous Christmas poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" has circulated on the Internet, unattributed, for many years. It's different from most other \"Night Before Christmas\" homages in that it pays tribute to its subjects — police officers — more than it pokes fun at them, and conveys an explicit religious message. It's also, if a bit maudlin, better written than most such parodies. Read on! \n'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the streets,Not a person was stirring, 'cept an officer on the beat.As he quietly patrolled the town with great care,children and parents slept peacefully there. \nThe officer was clad in his blues and his vest,gun on his hip, always looking his best.He'd just pulled aside for a quick bite to eat,When all of a sudden, out on the street, \nA bright light appeared from out of nowhere,He shielded his eyes from the brilliant glare.'Twas an angel of the Lord at the squad's rear,He smiled and spoke, \"Dear Officer, don't fear.\" \ncontinue reading below our video Highest Paid Male Actors Ever \n\"I've been sent by God with a message for youwho faithfully serve while wearing the blue.He wants you to know He loves you all,He's pleased with the way you've answered His call. \n\"To protect and serve others, so selfless you've been,Your bravery and kindness have known no end.Even in tragedy, when nights became long,You've helped countless strangers by being strong. \n\"God sees your heart, the joy and the pain,He knows the profession can often bring strain.So he sent me here to let you know,That as you patrol, He goes where you go. \n\"As you protect others, your Father protects you,His angels go with you, His Spirit does, too.No bullet too fast, no bad guy too strong,I'm sent to make sure that your life will be long. \n\"So fear not the night, and fear not the day,fear not the threats that might come your way.I'm sent to accompany you on your beat,There's not one moment you're alone on the street.\" \nThe officer sat stunned by the love of His God,He bowed his head, with a tear gave a nod.As the officer said thank you, the angel took flight,\"God's got your back, carry on, and good night.\" \nMore:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:42:43.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
