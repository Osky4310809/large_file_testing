Unfortunately, the service is currently quite limited: You can only get spirits in Seattle, Washington, while beer and wine are available in Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio.\nYou can order multiple items in one order, and Alexa will even help you out with recommendations — you can't have tortilla chips without salsa, right?\nAll in all, the new Alexa skill covers \"tens of thousands\" of items. To be able to shop with Alexa, you need to be a Prime member (with a default payment and shipping address set up) and you need to be in one of 30 cities where Prime Now is available — see the full list here .\nAmazon's smart voice assistant Alexa is available on a variety of devices, including Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, Fire Tablet and Fire TV.\nWATCH: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious", "external_links": ["http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20170321005678/en/576553/19/2858606_Amazon_-_Alexa_Voice_Shopping_-_v11_-_Final_MP4.mp4&.mp4", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Bzghp05d.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Bzghp05d.m3u8", "https://primenow.amazon.com/onboard?sourceUrl=%2F"], "published": "2017-03-21T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:32:22.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
