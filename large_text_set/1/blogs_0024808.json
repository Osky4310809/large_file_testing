Bottles of the sedative midazolam. AP \nThe Ohio attorney general's office said it was reviewing the decision and had no immediate comment. The inmates' attorneys and capital punishment opponents praised the ruling, noting that some other death-penalty states have abandoned midazolam. \n\"The risks of extraordinary pain and suffering with this protocol are unconstitutional, and this ruling correctly recognizes the problems with midazolam,\" said Megan McCracken of the Berkeley Law School Lethal Injection Project. \nOhio has not executed a prisoner since 2014 when rapist-murderer Dennis McGuire took 25 minutes to die and appeared to be gasping for air during the state's first execution using midazolam. \nLike many states, Ohio has not been able to find alternative execution chemicals, largely because pharmaceutical companies, under public pressure, have stopped selling them to prisons for lethal injections. Executions hit a 30-year low in the U.S. last year. Tracy Connor", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T03:25:41.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
