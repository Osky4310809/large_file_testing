Keep it Classic: Engrave Your Names and the Date of Your Wedding \nFor brides and grooms who prefer a classic approach, engraving your names and the date of your wedding never goes out of fashion.

Keep it Simple: \"Forever\" Forever.. a simple word with an important meaning.

Be Romantic: \"Amor Vincit Omnia\" Latin for \"love conquers all.\" Engrave a message in Latin and few people will understand it, making the sentiment more personal to you and your spouse. 4.

Make it Cheeky: Engrave Your Nicknames Brides and grooms sometimes engrave each other's nicknames inside their wedding rings. 6. Add Some Faith: A Religious Emgraving Engrave your wedding rings with a portion of a phrase or verse that's significant to your religion. 7. Be Symbolic: Engrave Your Rings with Symbols A heart, the peace symbol, the symbol for eternity -- many hand engravers can add a symbol to the inside of your wedding rings. 8. Make it Special: A Special Phrase Choose a personal phrase, one that only you and your future spouse understand the meaning of. Go ahead, inscribe the phrase in your rings, let everyone guess its true meaning. And there's no reason why the phrases must match -- each of you can choose a special sentiment. 9. Make a Vow: Engrave a Phrase from Your Wedding Vows Engrave a few short words from your wedding vows. The phrase you choose might signify love, respect, trust, eternity -- anything you want to say to each other.\nSome couples let their sentiments float around the exterior of wedding bands. You can adorn the outside of plain bands with a special engraving. 10. Be Poetic: Engravings from Poetry and Other Literature \nWords from any special poem or book, sentimental to comical. \nYou're off to a good start.
