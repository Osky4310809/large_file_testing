And reveals that the film is based around the backdrop of 1971 war, with the caption, “Our Hero? Their Spy?” and the poster claims to be inspired by true events. \nWhile the posters of the film are intriguing, it is the caption that reminds me of Emraan Hashmi’s upcoming film based on similar theme, Captain Nawab . The reason is simple, even in that poster Emraan’s character was seen in half Pakistani army’s and half Indian army’s uniform, with caption, “Two Countries One Soldier”. \nBoth the films are still in pre-production and there is a possibility that both have completely different storylines but these similarities can’t be ignored.
