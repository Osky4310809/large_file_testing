Thanks to 20th Century Fox, the cinematic universe of X-Men is an extensive one, and the franchise is now extending its reach to television. In February, FX will debut Legion and introduce audiences to a mutant named David Haller who shoulders a rather powerful mutation. Given the character’s expansive history in the comics, many wondered whether Legion would take place in the same world as the X-Men movies and allow crossovers.

In an interview with IGN , producer Lauren Shuler Donner was asked if Legion would be within the larger X-Men film universe - and she said no. \n“No, we're making it separate,” she explained. “We're our own world.” \nWhen asked to clarify her words, Donner stressed that Legion and the X-Men film universe are entirely separate. IGN even inquired about Legion ’s possible iteration of Professor Xavier and whether it could be that of Patrick Stewart or James McAvoy. Donner confirmed that it would not be either of those versions because Legion is “in a different world.” \nOf course, there are loopholes around the separate universes schtick. If FX and 20th Century Fox wanted, a crossover between the franchises could happen one way or another. Earlier this month, Legion’ s executive producer touched upon the topic of crossovers and seemed cautiously optimistic. \nSpeaking to Entertainment Weekly , Noah Hawley said, “I’m firm believer the show has to stand on its own two feet. For a crossover to be possible we have to earn that right through the quality of our storytelling and hopefully our popularity. David’s origin story hasn’t changed, so we haven’t changed that connection to the X-Men universe.” \nLegion is the story of a troubled young man who may be more than human. It introduces the story of David Haller, who since he was a teenager, has struggled with mental illness. Diagnosed as schizophrenic, David has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years. But after a strange encounter with a fellow patient, he’s confronted with the possibility that the voices he hears and the visions he sees might be real. \nDan Stevens (Downton Abbey), Rachel Keller (Fargo), Jean Smart (Fargo), Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation), Jeremie Harris (A Walk Among the Tombstones), Amber Midthunder (Hell or High Water), Katie Aselton (The League) and Bill Irwin (Interstellar) star in Legion . \nMore LEGION: New Legion Teaser Image / New Legion Trailer / Legion In X-Men Comic Books / Who Is Legion? / Jemaine Clement Joins Legion / Legion Producers Talk X-Men And Marvel Universe Connections / How Legion Could Fix X-Men Continuity \nNoah Hawley (Fargo) will serve as an Executive Producer along with Lauren Shuler Donner (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Deadpool), Bryan Singer (X-Men: Apocalypse, Superman Returns), Simon Kinberg (X-Men: Days of Future Past, The Martian), Jeph Loeb (Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Marvel’s Daredevil, Marvel’s Jessica Jones), Jim Chory (Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Marvel’s Daredevil, Marvel’s Jessica Jones) and John Cameron (Fargo, The Big Lebowski).
