The native of Monterrey, Mexico moved up to the Cup Series this year to replace Carl Edwards when Edwards decided to step away from racing in the offseason. \nNow Suárez is replacing Edwards as a Subway ad pitchman. He said he filmed his first commercial in both English and Spanish. \n“You know, I spent a lot of hours trying to do my lines right in English. In Spanish, I spent 10 minutes,” said Suárez, laughing. “I thought that was pretty funny.” \nCheck out the trailer for the commercial below, although you’ll have to wait for during the race on Sunday to see the actual finished product. Suárez, however, obviously is pleased with how it turned out. \n“(Thursday) was the first time I was able to see the final version of the commercial,” he said. “It turned out great. So I’m super excited about that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:02:59.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
