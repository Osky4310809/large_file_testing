Last year, the first season ran for six seasons and saw Reedus riding across California, New Orleans, and interesting continental United States locations. \nWhile the actor has already teased an episode featuring his Walking Dead co-star Jeffrey Dean Morgan and revealed that he'll be riding across Hawaii for one episode, there is going to be another exciting celebrity appearing on Ride with Norman Reedus for its second season. Dave Chappelle will be appearing on the AMC series with Reedus, only months after returning to television for Saturday Night Live , AMC has confirmed to ComicBook.com. \nChappelle is likely a fan of The Walking Dead . His most notable sketch on Saturday Night Live was one which saw the comedian impersonating The Walking Dead 's Season 6 finale, fully dressed as Negan and making heads roll ( literally, watch it right here ). \nChappelle's Show ran two complete seasons with a third surfacing later on under the title, \"The Lost Episodes.\" Since going off the air of Comedy Central, Chappelle has managed to keep a low profile and sporadically appeared in comedy clubs around the country. His appearance on Ride with Norman Reedus will be a rare event which sees the comedian hoping back on to television. \nMORE WALKING DEAD: What Happens To Dwight In The Comics? / What Happens To Eugene In The Comics? / Austin Amelio Calls Season 7 Finale A Fulfilling Turning Point / New Photos From Say Yes / Eugene's Nod to Abraham Ford In 7x11 \nBe sure to give The Walking Dead a rating on our TV show rankings below!
