As the chamber gears up for a final vote on the American Health Care Act, Trump said that anyone who voted no could lose their seat in 2018. \nThe new was reported by Politico . \nAccording to the website, Trump was greeted with cheers when he walked into the room, before asking permission to “go off script.” The president continued. \n“I’m asking for your vote on Thursday,” he said.”Many of you came in on the pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare. I honestly think many of you will lose your seats in 2018 if you don’t get this done.” \nAs of Tuesday, the bill’s passage remained far from certain. A day earlier, Rep. Sean Duffy told Fox & Friends that the votes still were not there. After Trump’s meeting, members of the famously recalcitrant Freedom Caucus said they were still uncertain. As late as last week, the caucus said they were steadfastly opposed to the bill. The House Freedom Caucus still opposes the GOP replacement bill in its current form. \n— House Freedom Caucus (@freedomcaucus) March 17, 2017 \nTrump’s ability to persuade will likely be diminished after FBI director James Comey revealed his White House is currently under investigation over allegations of improper ties to Russia. \n  \nHave a tip we should know?
