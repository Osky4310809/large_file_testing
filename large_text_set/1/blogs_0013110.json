Family solicitor Robert Thoyt informs him that he is the sole heir and whilst his father's servant Brace is pleased to see him brothel madam Helga, who has turned the family offices into a bordello, is not and nor are the Gearys, who hope to buy him off. Most hostile of all are Sir Stuart Strange and the East India Company who dispute James' legacy of land in Canada, claiming it is crucial to England in its war with America. They suggest buying it from him but he refuses, making enemies of them.
