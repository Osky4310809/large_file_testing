One only has to look at how they operate, force their way into cities intimidate drivers. \n— Keith Parkins (@keithpp) February 24, 2017 \nIt’s an easy assumption to make, given the company has said it would be holding an independent investigation into the claims and has used similar tactics before. \nIn 2015 , Uber hired a CIA-linked intelligence firm Ergo to look into the background of a conservationist suing the company. It used the same firm in 2016 to look into the backgrounds of the plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against the company. Uber has also threatened to dig up dirt on journalists critical of its efforts. \nHowever, Uber swears it’s not them this time and that it has not authorized anyone to search into Rigetti’s personal life, either. “This behavior is wrong and Uber is absolutely not involved in it,” Uber told TechCrunch. \nRigetti has yet to get back to us about the tweet but later tweeted she doesn’t know “who is doing this or why,” asking her followers to send her the contact information of anyone who might approach them and ask for her personal information. I don't know who is doing this or why. If someone contacts you, please send me their contact information immediately. \n— Susan Fowler Rigetti (@susanthesquark) February 24, 2017 \nMeanwhile the company worth more than $65 billion continues in crisis mode, bringing in former Attorney General Eric Holder and Arianna Huffington to calm fears, holding an hour-long session with HR to answer questions after the weekly company meeting and CEO Travis Kalanick personally met with more than 100 women working for the company last night to hear their concerns over sexism within the company culture.
