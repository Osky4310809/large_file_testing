But this is good news. He won the election. Beyond the circus this all causes, there are now serious questions to be asked. How does that impact his ability to lead if he continues to get distracted by the small stuff or his ability to manage relationships with our allies or our enemies? How does this impact his agenda? How does this impact his support on the hill?” \nRobert Traynham observed a little insecurity in some of these responses on things like voter fraud and crowd sizes, asking who Trump has in his orbit who can tell him to avoid these minor issues. \nTodd also pointed out that there are perfectly reasonable explanations for why Trump had a smaller crowd size than Obama did without taking anything away from the size of Trump’s victory. \nWatch above, via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:40:14.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
