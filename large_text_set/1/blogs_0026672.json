LUCIE, Fla. — Noah doubt about it.\nTerry Collins has intimidating right-hander Noah Syndergaard slated to be the Mets’ 2017 Opening Day starter come April 3 at Citi Field against the Braves.\nThe official word will come down in spring training, but the ball belongs to Thor on Opening Day.\n“He is one of our big character guys,’’ Collins told The Post on Monday. “He says, ‘Give me the ball,’ and he goes out and does the best he can. This kid has pitched some huge games. There was the Game 5 in L.A. [in the 2015 NLDS] when he came in and struck out Justin Turner and he had never pitched out of the bullpen before. There was Game 3 in the World Series and the wild-card last year [against Madison Bumgarner].’’\nIn that game Syndergaard pitched seven shutout innings, allowing only two hits while striking out 10.\nSyndergaard, 24, was 14-9 in 2016. This will be his 56th regular-season start for the Mets since being called up in May 2015. Syndergaard will join the likes of Tom Seaver and Dwight Gooden as Mets’ Opening Day starters.\nSEE ALSO \nSyndergaard ranks Mets pitchers in telling Matt Harvey appraisal :0 Noah Syndergaard, the Mets’ hard-throwing ace during the season and professional... Syndergaard ranks Mets pitchers in telling Matt Harvey appraisal Such a move will enable Matt Harvey and Jacob deGrom to come back from their 2016 injuries at a more relaxed pace.\nCollins told this story about his aces:\n“[Phillies coach] Larry Bowa told me, ‘When I first saw Harvey I said, ‘Holy bleep. This guy may be the best I’ve seen. Then deGrom comes in and I said, this guy is unbelievable. Now I’m saying that about Syndergaard. I think he’s better than all of them.’ ’’\nCome Opening Day, Thor will be center stage.\n“There are so many players that you say to yourself, ‘If this guy gets it, look out.’ Well, this guy gets it. And Noah got it fast,’’ Collins said.\n“I tell you, you talk about competitive, and he asks the right questions, that first year he asked all the right questions and he applied stuff,’’ Collins said. “When he first learned the two-seamer and the changeup, he took them right into the game. He didn’t wait two weeks. He’s been fun to watch his development in such a short time.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:44:50.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
