It’s a pretty funny ad and one that serves its purpose. \nIt reminds you that Busch beer exists. You might have forgotten that if you are no longer in college (or high school) and in need of a cheap 30-pack, or if you haven’t been to a NASCAR race recently. Fun fact, if you ask someone born and raised in the South like me to say Busch and their accent will kick in immediately. Seriously, it’s impossible to hide a Southern accent while saying Busch.\n\nIt also is catchy and I fully expect to get annoyed by people saying “Busccc ” over the next few weeks. Anyways, shoutout to Busch for this ad. It’s a good ad and Busch is a perfectly fine beer. \nThe post-commercial cut-in from Fox was also funny and carried on the schtick. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:35:10.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
