Easy to use also. Highly recommend! Good at finding duplicates. But SW needs slight improvement... by b@@lsofst33l Having said that, I would recommend this SW anyways. I got it on sale for $0.99 and sure glad I did. Below I give a quick overview of the SW nitty-gritty, my strategy to use the SW (for what it’s worth), and couple things I would want to see improved. Quick overview of what the SW does:It can find all the identical photos and puts it into a “group” User can then either manually select which photos to remove or have the SW automatically select the duplicate photos. If you move the slider, it will look for similar photos and group them as if they were identical photos. Photo could be identical but have a different time stamp (because user copied to another drive and triggered a new time stamp). SW would treat such photos as similar since bit-wise (down on file level) photo is not considered identical anymore. Slide the slider even more and SW would start grouping similar photos (actual similar photos taken using burst mode or just someone who kept taking photos without changing position). Slide some more and you would start seeing variations within the grouped photos (someone blinked or moved their head in one photo but not the other, etc). My strategy is typically to find true identical photo duplicates and remove them. Then move the slider just a bit and have software find photos that are only slightly different and remove them. Move slider some more and see more similar photos but now take a closer look at what it finds. With majority of identical and very close photos out of the way, I have less to review. Normally there would be a couple of photos in a group but some groups would have multiple. I am interested in groups of multiple since I can gauge if the software is starting to bunch up actual similar photos in one group. Those I can quickly review and unmark the photos I actually want to keep. I can repeat the process some more until I see that the only thing it finds are similar photos but I still want to keep them. Perhaps this strategy is not the best, but I don’t have forever to cherry pick. It seems to do the job and I feel good about it. Two things I wish developer would improve on, # 1 being most important to me: 1. After finding duplicates (lets say all identical but with different time stamps), I wish SW would auto mark all the duplicates that have a LATER time stamp and leave photos with OLDEST time stamp alone. 2. Allow for review pics to be even smaller in size and less space between them and group title/headers so more photos can be crammed into the screen. 3. When software has to process 10’s of thousands of photos, there could be a situation where the SW would crash. I’m using a 2009 27\" iMac, 2.6 GHz quad core i5, 20GB of RAM, plenty of disk space (4TB drive)… If I relaunch the SW and rerun the scan, it would most likely pass. I do not think it is my hardware (although can’t rule that out 100%), but I am leaning toward software. When I process photos in smaller batches, I don’t experience same issue. Other than that I think the SW is great and I am glad I have it to sort through unfathomable number of photos that looked like a dump of folders, folder within folders, different dates, from various sources, multiple back ups over the years without any kind of coherent organization… I can’t imagine having to sort through all that one photo at a time! Would be great if it would stop crashing. by enigma_cipher This app would be great if it didn;t crash every five minutes. Does a great job searching for and finding duplicates, but as you go through the duplicates, the app crashes - often. I’ve already had three crashes in the first hour of using it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:16:09.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
