Given what’s happened to her, the extent of what’s happened over the period of time, anything might have transpired.’\nShe has spoken to family in the UK but is unable to return while a new passport is arranged.\nThe tourist, who police believe had been in the country since 2015, was treated in hospital for injuries which also included scratches and cuts to her neck and bruising to her body.\nThe suspect, from the Manunda suburb of Cairns, appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences, including four counts of rape, eight counts of assault and four counts of strangulation.\nHe also appeared in custody at Roma Magistrates’ Court accused of two counts of deprivation of liberty, two counts of wilful damage, one count of possessing dangerous drugs, one count of possessing drug utensils and one count of obstructing police.\nA Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are supporting a British woman following an incident in Queensland and remain in contact with the local authorities.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T09:13:48.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
