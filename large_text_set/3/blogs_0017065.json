It wasn’t until the late '90s that Harold Hambrick, then president of the L.A. Black Business Expo, helped revitalize the center by offering a rent-free restaurant space to local caterer Desiree Edwards, provided she open a business geared toward serving the community. In 1997, Edwards debuted the newly christened Watts Coffee House, an operation she still runs today. \nTwenty years later, Watts Coffee House has retained its iconic if slightly under-the-radar status among locals, even winning one of Steve Harvey’s popular “Hoodie Awards” in 2003. When outsider chefs Roy Choi and Daniel Patterson arrived in the neighborhood last year to open Locol , their community-minded healthful fast food restaurant, they were quick to acknowledge the significance that the nearby coffee house played in the community, as an act of both deference and provocation. (“It’s a great place with great people, but it’s the only sit-down restaurant in Watts,” Choi told Los Angeles Magazine .) \nIf you’re dining at Watts Coffee House for the first time, the server will undoubtedly point you toward breakfast (the restaurant is open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays, except Monday, with shortened hours on the weekend). This is not a bad thing. The house speciality — other than potent, diner-style black coffee — is more or less the breakfast plate heaped with creamy, butter-soaked grits, a fluffy homemade biscuit (provided they don’t run out), two eggs and a couple of crunchy, well-seasoned fried chicken wings. If you’re more intrigued by hard-seared hash browns, crumbly salmon croquettes, spicy hot links and pan-fried pork chops, they've got those too (try the “On The 1 Gangsta Breakfast,” an everything-on-the-menu sampler platter). You should probably make room for at least one waffle too, as their unique torpedo-shaped version is ideally suited for dipping in warm syrup. As you can imagine, a soul food breakfast lends itself to overindulgence. \nAnd yes, as previously mentioned, the pace of business here fluctuates between molasses-like and downright glacial. But this is a positive attribute, I think, if only to absorb the memorabilia lining the walls, to strike up a conversation with the next table, or to savor the home-cooked quality of the food when it finally arrives. Few restaurants, if any, manage to capture the spirit of an entire neighborhood — for better or worse, willingly or otherwise — in the way that Watts Coffee House does. That alone is worth the wait. \nWatts Coffee House, 1827 E. 103rd St., Watts.
