It looks as non-threatening as you would want a robot that stays in your house to look, with a smooth, round design complete with digital quirky expressions. It even dances along with the music you play, which is both odd and adorable.\nDon’t miss: CES 2017: Everything announced and what’s still to come \nThe screen that acts as its face is where you’ll find the eyes, which appear to wait expectantly for you to command it. Like many products at CES this year, the Hub Robot takes aim squarely at the smart home. LG has partnered with Amazon and Google to bring similar AI functionality to their robot. Unlike the Echo or Google Home however, you can rename the Hub Robot to whatever you want. So if you aren’t fond of yelling out “Hey Google” or “Hey Alexa”, you can simply rename it to something like Fred. Hey Fred.\nIn LG’s vision of the future, your virtual assistant will work with all of your home appliances thanks to SmartThinQ. Everything from your refrigerator to the lock on your front door can be taken care of by the Hub Robot. There’s no word on pricing or availability just yet, but the functionality is still pretty exciting.\nBe sure to stay tuned to Android Authority for more coverage on the latest tech at CES 2017 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:50:26.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
