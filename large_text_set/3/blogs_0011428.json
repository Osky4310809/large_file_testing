A small number of Tory Remainers could abstain or vote against the Government on the Bill giving Theresa May the power to begin the process of leaving the EU. But insiders say there will not be enough to thwart the process, while senior figures in the unelected House of Lords indicated they would not block the will of the Commons. Brexit Secretary David Davis urged MPs not to ‘tie the Prime Minister’s hands’ by backing wrecking amendments passed last week by the Lords. Brexit Secretary David Davis (pictured, on the Andrew Marr Show) says the Prime Minister must be given a free hand to negotiate If MPs and peers reject all amendments today, it is understood the Queen could give Royal Assent tomorrow morning, meaning the Bill would be passed into law. That would free up Mrs May to trigger Article 50 – starting the two-year period of negotiation before Brexit – as soon as tomorrow. She has vowed to invoke Article 50 before the end of this month, meaning Britain will exit the EU by March 2019 at the latest. This afternoon, MPs will debate two Lords amendments to the Brexit Bill. One would give Parliament a ‘meaningful’ vote on the divorce deal, while the other guarantees protections for EU nationals living in Britain. If, as expected, they are rejected, peers will meet in the evening to decide whether accept the verdict of MPs. Voters are confident People have not stopped shopping Consumers are ‘unfazed’ by Brexit uncertainty and feel confident about their future, a survey has found. Less than a third of those questioned said they were worried about the effect of leaving the EU, and just 15.5 per cent were anxious about job security. And less than one in ten homeowners expected the value of their property to fall this year, according to HSBC’s survey of 2,000 people. HSBC said: ‘It seems fair to say that the message from the Remain camp in the pre-referendum period – that voting for Brexit would threaten your job and knock down the value of your house – simply has not resonated with voters. ‘Consumption has been critical to the UK’s resilience following the vote to leave the EU, with the average household having remained largely unfazed by the prospect of political change.’ George Osborne, who masterminded the Remain campaign’s Project Fear, is expected to back the Government, although others such as former education secretary Nicky Morgan may still rebel. Allies of the ex-Chancellor say he believes ministers will give assurances the Commons will have a truly ‘meaningful’ vote on the final Brexit deal. Tory MPs including ex-chancellor Ken Clarke and former business minister Anna Soubry could still rebel. But the number of rebels – ten at most – is not enough to defeat the Government. Pro-Leave MPs warn that, if the amendments passed, Parliament would have an effective veto, giving Brussels an incentive to offer a worse deal. Yesterday Mr Davis urged rebels to pass the Bill unamended. On the Andrew Marr Show, he said: ‘Please don’t tie the Prime Minister’s hands in the process of doing that for things which we expect to attain anyway.’ Tory rebel MPs backing the amendment may include ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve and Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie. Asked if Parliament will get a meaningful vote, Mr Davis said: ‘What we can’t have is either House of Parliament reversing the decision of the British people.’ If the votes go the way of the Government, the Bill will go before the Lords this evening. Labour sources warned there was a 20 per cent chance of peers sending the Bill back if their amendments were dismissed out of hand. But Labour’s leader in the Lords has promised not to defy the will of the Commons. And yesterday two Tory peers who rebelled last time – Baroness Altmann and Lord Heseltine – suggested they would back down. Ex-deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine, sacked from Government roles after voting against Mrs May in the Lords, admitted yesterday that he would fall in line if MPs defeat the amendments, adding: ‘The arguments for the supremacy of the Commons would be very powerful.’ Theresa May (pictured) will start the ball rolling by writing to European Council president Donald Tusk, setting out Britain's demands of the EU post-Brexit To begin the process of leaving the EU, Mrs May will write to European Council president Donald Tusk, setting out Britain’s demands. She would also be expected to tell the Commons Article 50 has been invoked. Mr Tusk has said EU leaders will respond within 48 hours. EU leaders will then hold a meeting, probably next month, to agree a response, before Mr Tusk replies with the EU’s position and sounding the starting gun on talks. Nicola Sturgeon is today expected to issue a string of demands over what Westminster should request for Scotland from Brexit. The First Minister of Scotland will announce her response to Brexit, ahead of Article 50 being formally triggered. She could also this week announce plans for a second Scottish independence referendum.
