Baracketology was a success because it was clear he was a fan of the sport and the NCAA tournament, like millions of other Americans.” \nWe’re surprised that Trump wouldn’t want to try and beat his predecessor, who correctly predicted the national champion only one time, picking North Carolina in 2009. \nThumbnail photo via Sam Greene/The Cincinnati Enquirer via USA TODAY NETWORKS More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:39:30.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
