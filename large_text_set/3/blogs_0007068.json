The Beast cited the Facebook page of Nicolosiâ€™s clinic, the Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic in Encino, CA for the news. According to the note , posted earlier this afternoon: \nWe are deeply saddened and shocked to announce the death of Dr. Joseph Nicolosi yesterday in California from complications from the flu. \nMy condolences to his wife Linda and son Joseph, Jr. \nThe illness must have come upon him quickly; I know someone who spoke to him just recently. As always, he was vigorously defending his ideas. \nWe disagreed about a great many things, but I can say to his credit that he cared deeply about his family, his work, and his clients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T01:22:56.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
