Although his candidacy was widely opposed by Silicon Valley executives , it appears that the new administration and the technology industry could find some common ground. \nYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook , on Twitter at @ben_kew , or email him at bkew@breitbart.com Read More Stories About: \nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.
