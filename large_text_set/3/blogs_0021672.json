In addition “Katrina Girl” and Mike would speak on the phone about life and how school was going. \nHis encouragement had an impact on young LaShay (now 14 years old). She decided to join the Air Force sponsored pre-training program known as Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) at Bay High School. 19 \nLaShay on her JROTC training: “It was very interesting and a challenge, and because I had never done it before. I knew if I joined I would have help from Mike along the way if I needed it, or was confused about anything.” \nMike’s reply to LaShay’s JROTC experience: “I am proud of her no matter what she does and will support her in everything she does,” he says. “I think she understands service and I believe that she will do great things no matter what she chooses.” 20 \nOver the past weekend, Mike was invited back to Waveland, Mississippi for a special request from “Katrina Girl”. Would you accompany me to the JROTC Ball? Advertisement 21 \nMike’s response to LaShay’s family: “I’m going because I would do anything to repay the hug to LaShay and her family. They mean as much to me as my own.” 22 \nPJ Mike Maroney is retiring from the AF but plans to help train and mentor future Pararescue and Combat Control candidates. \n“Life in service to the planet is important whether serving in the military or as a teacher, nurse or volunteer. Service makes life that much more appreciated.” 23 \nFunny how the world turns. “You rescued me more than I rescued you.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:06:19.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
