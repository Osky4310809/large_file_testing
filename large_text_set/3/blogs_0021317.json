As a result, the president is now 544th on the list.

What happens in that micro-market does more to affect the net worth of Donald Trump than anything else in the world. Lately, the neighborhood has been struggling,” the magazine said. \nAlong with that, Trump spent $66 million on the presidential campaign and paid $25 million to settle a lawsuit related to Trump University. \nDonald Trump had previously disputed the estimates presented by Forbes, particularly concerning the worth of his brand that is much harder to value compared to real estate. \n“As we wrote in our cover story on the president’s net worth 18 months ago, Donald Trump has been trying to spin his Forbes valuation for more than three decades. In the early years, editors even joked about the ‘Trump rule’ - take what he claims and divide by three,” said Randall Lane, editor of Forbes Magazine, as quoted by the Washington Post. #Trump ’s wealth down $800mn this year - Forbes https://t.co/SapNP87479 pic.twitter.com/2X5rYXsjq3 — RT (@RT_com) September 29, 2016 \nAccording to its methodology, the magazine values assets using stock prices and international exchange rates, basing on the so-called snapshot of wealth taken at the end of February. \nREAD MORE: Goldman Sachs bans employee donations to Trump’s election campaign, but Clinton not subject to rule \n“Every year Forbes goes through his assets line by line, speaking with dozens of experts about market values, and hearing out Trump and his team. We do not give any credit for ‘brand value’ to Trump or Oprah or any other person on our list - we feel a person’s brand value is already reflected in the income and value of the deals they cut. And we are very comfortable with our estimates for Trump’s tangible holdings, which also factor in things like debt and partnerships, as well as current market conditions,” the editor stressed.
