Let’s not even call it a trend, actually; minimalism has been there for ages. It is, in fact, more like a lifestyle, featuring simplicity in its purest form. While the aesthetics in this case may look simple at first glance, with its neutral, earth-toned colour palette and clean lines, it's anything but that. There's some level of complexity involved. How to work different textures, fabrics, and even tones of the same colour can be a little tricky. Contrary to popular belief, minimalism proves that you don’t have to own a ton of clothes to look your best. The key to living with fewer pieces is to work them in a different way, every time. So we did all the legwork for you so you can master this beautiful art, by following six very simple steps! 1.This goes without mentioning but, keep it simple. No, over-the-top pieces would not do. If you feel an outfit looks too dramatic, pair it again. 2.Have a capsule wardrobe full of staples. All the wardrobe must-haves - like a white shirt, a good pair of blue jeans, a black blazer, a little black dress - all should be a part of this! 3.Choose the colours that work best for you. As opposed to what is believed, you don’t have to stick to neutral colours only. Bold colours like reds, blues, and yellows also work, only if done tastefully. 4.Choose your designs. Your minimalistic pieces do not have to be boring. Focus on their designs and cuts. A boxy fit, asymmetrical hemlines, anything neatly done can work. 5.Limit your layers. Minimalism is all about fuss free clothing. Single outfits, like a dress or jumpsuit, layered with a classy coat works best. 6.Match your accessories. Surprisingly, accessories are quite important even in minimalism, but only the right ones work. They should be in tune with your outfit, and instead of being too jazzy and dramatic, keep it simple, clean and minimal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:44:01.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
