As seen in the photo at left, it looks like wispy gray streaks hanging underneath the base of a cloud. For this reason, you may also hear virga referred to as \"fallstreaks.\" \nThe storms that associated with virga are called dry thunderstorms because they produce trace amounts of ground level precipitation only. Seen When Relative Humidity is Under 50% \nVirga is produced when precipitation falls from high clouds into extremely dry air (low humidity) and high air temperatures below. (Virga is commonly seen across the desert region of the Western United States, an area prone to both low humidity and high temperatures.) As the liquid raindrops or ice crystals hit the warm, dry air they absorb the high levels of heat energy which energizes the movement of their water molecules, transforming them straight into water vapor (sublimation). \nEventually as more and more precipitation evaporates into the air, the air becomes more moist (RH rises). \ncontinue reading below our video Test Your General Science Knowledge If precipitation is light, it can take several hours for the air to saturate. As the air saturates first aloft, then down to the surface, a kind of \"moist pathway\" is carved out that precipitation can follow to the surface as rain or snow. Virga On Radar \nLike all light precipitation, virga shows up on radar as shades of light green (rain) or light blue (snow). However, with virga, while the radar may detect it, your eyes won't! If you've ever watched your radar screen and seen the leading edge of a rain or snow band over your location but not seen any rain or snow actually falling outside your door, then you've been tricked by virga before. This is common in winter, especially when waiting on the start of a snowstorm. We've all heard our meteorologist say \" It's already snowing in the upper air, but the air at the surface is too dry to see it. \" Virga vs. Rain Shafts \nIt's easy to mistake virga for a distant rain shaft (a dark curtain of rainfall extending from the base of a thunderstorm down to the ground). What's the biggest giveaway it's virga? If it's virga, it won't reach the ground. \nMore: For other pairs of weather \"look-alikes,\" read the About Weather article Twinning Weather . Why the Funny Name? \nKeeping in the tradition of clouds whose names are Latin, the term is derived from the Latin word virga, meaning \"twig\" or \"branch.\" Commas in the Sky \nIt is also theorized that virga are partially responsible for creating hole-punch clouds . In addition, virga high in the atmosphere can reflect sunlight creating brilliant sun pillars and other atmospheric optics associated with sunlight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:08:22.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
