They would typically carry 120-140 migrants each a spokeswoman for the organization said.\n“We don’t think there can be any other explanation than that these dinghies would have been full of people,” Proactiva spokeswoman Laura Lanuza told AFP. “It seems clear that they sunk.”\n“In over a year we have never seen any of these dinghies that were anything other than packed,” Lanuza added.\nAll of the bodies recovered by Proactiva were African men aged between 16 and 25, according to Proactiva’s estimate. The boat’s medical staff gauged that they had drowned within 24-hours of being discovered.\nNGOs reportedly attended to a third boat that had gotten into trouble on Thursday afternoon, leading to fears that other may have drowned.\nThe number of people-trafficked migrants setting sail from Libya has spiked in recent months from already record levels. Since the end of last week, Italian-coordinated rescue boats reportedly picked up almost 6,000 people. Almost 22,000 migrants have been bought to Italy so far in 2017.\n[ AFP ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:58:31.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
