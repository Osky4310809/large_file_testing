Todd Fisher, son of Debbie and brother to Carrie, shared a very personal story from after his sister’s passing on December 27, 2016.\n“When Carrie died, my mother decided to change her plans a bit,” he said. “My mother always said to me, ‘I never want to go to my daughter’s funeral service. I would like to be buried with Carrie.’ I didn’t know she was going to leave us that very next day and when she looked at me to ask permission to leave, she said she wanted to be with Carrie, and she closed her eyes and went to sleep. It was a beautiful exit.”\nThe ceremony was livestreamed on the official website for Debbie Reynolds for the world to see. James Blunt unveiled his new work “Courtney’s Song” at the memorial, Dan Aykroyd spoke to the mourning crowd and the Debbie Reynolds Dance Studio provided a performance. Although the ceremony has now wrapped, it’s impossible to imagine that this marks the end of the tributes crafted for Reynolds or Carrie Fisher. They will be celebrated for decades and centuries to come.\n\n(Via USA Today , Entertainment Weekly & People )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:56:14.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
