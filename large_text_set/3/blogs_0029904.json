What happened to your face?” \nAnother said: “Oh dear! Make sure you floss every day as those teeth aren't a great look.” \nA third added: “OMG!! This is terrible.” Is that really you, Becks?

Quite a few simply remarked, “still would”, while others reckoned Becks would be gorgeous no matter what he looked like. \nThose that read the caption would know the picture was taken on the set of Guy Ritchie’s upcoming King Arthur movie, where Beckham has a cameo as a grumpy knight. \nHe confirmed the role in an interview with The Times in 2015, saying: “I had 13 lines and practised a huge amount beforehand. Guy had someone come and rehearse with me, and I did that an hour every day in the build-up.” \nBecks added that filming had been \"nerve wracking\" but he'd enjoyed it.
