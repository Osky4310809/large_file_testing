Ben Manzi, 7, has been fighting leukemia since December 2015, and Landen Palatino, 9, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a grade 4 brain tumor, in January 2016. (It has since been removed.) Brady knew he had to do something, so he turned to the baseball cards he started collecting when he was 3. The idea has paid off: To date, Brady has sold more than $13,000 in baseball cards, with all of the proceeds going toward Ben and Landen’s medical bills , according to Yahoo! News . \n“Proud seems like such a small word for what we feel,” Jessie Kahle, Brady’s mother, told ABC News this week. “How selfless he’s been has been pretty incredible. The way he’s so proud of what he’s doing. He’s always coming up with new ways to make it better and make it bigger.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:51:57.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
