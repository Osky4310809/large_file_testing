Yikes! \nNot only did Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski reveal that Donald Trump 's controversial mouthpiece Kellyanne Conway desperately tries to book herself on various news programs, but she's also now BARRED from the MSNBC program (a show we know Drumpf watches)! \nThe reason? Because Brzezinski doesn't believe in \"fake news\" and Kellyanne is \"not credible anymore.\" \nWell, no shit! \nRelated: Kellyanne Said 'Love You' To A Self-Proclaimed White Nationalist \nThe correspondent said: \n\"I know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show; I won't do it. I don't believe in fake news or information that is not true. That is — every time I've ever seen her on television something is askew, off or incorrect.\" \nHer cohost Joe Scarborough jumped in to echo that Miz Conway is just trying to \"prove her relevance\": \n\"I don't even think she's saying something she knows to be untrue. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance because behind the scenes she's not in these meetings and any reporter can ask anybody in that White House and they will say the same thing. She's not in these meetings. So why does the president allow her to keep going out and spreading false information?\" \nBrzezinski concluded: \n\"Kellyanne Conway does not need to text our show, as long as I'm on it. It's not happening here.\" \nSnap snap! \nTrump and his minions waged a war on the media , and they're fighting right back! \nWatch the full segment (below)!!
