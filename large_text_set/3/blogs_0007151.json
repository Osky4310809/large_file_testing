Found this in my local card shop @ClintonsTweet #disgusting.” \nSiam Goorwich added: “Oh god, that is SO vile!!!” Clintons has come in for criticism before for its 'council estate' Christmas card (Photo: PA) \nThe card was on sale at the retailer’s St Albans store and other shops in its portfolio of more than 400 store locations across the UK. \nHowever, it is not known if all stores the stocked it. \nClintons quickly responded to the tweet saying: “Dear Lucy, We sincerely apologise for any offence caused. \n\"We have received confirmation from our buying team, that all stores will remove this card from sale tomorrow.\" \nThe retailer was forced to pull sales of a Santa Claus 'Council Estate' Christmas card after it caused outrage in 2014. \nThe £2 card ran a list of “10 reasons why Santa Claus must live on a council estate” including; he only works once a year; he’s never actually been seen doing any work in his whole life; he drinks alcohol during working hours. \nIt was being sold by Clintons who at first described it as “funny” on their website but customers did not see the humour and hundreds took to Twitter to voice their opinions. \nClintons quickly withdrew the card and apologised “without reservation.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:54:26.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
