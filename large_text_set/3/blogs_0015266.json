His birthday is Jan. 6, just a few weeks before his dad was inaugurated as the 45th president.\nLara, who married Eric at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. in 2014, said the pregnancy initially made her full run down, but she’s feeling “really good” now.\n“I knew I always wanted kids someday,” Lara told People, adding that she’s also excited to see Eric take on his new role of fatherhood. “He’s the cool uncle. He’s watch <i>Frozen</i> many times.”\nThe expectant parents still don’t know what they’re going to name their little one. “We really loved the name Charlie, but we’d already named our dog that so it’s out,” Eric said.\n[ People ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:08:27.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
