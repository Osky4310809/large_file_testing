A decade later, he won a Nobel Peace Prize. How's that \"may issue\" gun permit policy working for you? The NRA opposed these discretionary gun permit laws and proceeded to grant NRA charters to blacks who sought to defend themselves from Klan violence -- including the great civil rights hero Robert F. Williams. A World War II Marine veteran, Williams returned home to Monroe, N.C., to find the Klan riding high -- beating, lynching and murdering blacks at will. No one would join the NAACP for fear of Klan reprisals. Williams became president of the local chapter and increased membership from six to more than 200. But it was not until he got a charter from the NRA in 1957 and founded the Black Armed Guard that the Klan got their comeuppance in Monroe. Williams' repeated thwarting of violent Klan attacks is described in his stirring book, \"Negroes With Guns.\" In one crucial battle, the Klan sieged the home of a black physician and his wife, but Williams and his Black Armed Guard stood sentry and repelled the larger, cowardly force. And that was the end of it. As the Klan found out, it's not so much fun when the rabbit's got the gun. The NRA's proud history of fighting the Klan has been airbrushed out of the record by those who were complicit with the KKK, Jim Crow and racial terror, to wit: the Democrats. \nWomen are the fastest growing demographic in the country and this fact was clearly embraced at this year’s convention. The NRA has launched an entire media organization dedicated to women with role models like Second Amendment advocate Natalie Foster and shooting champion Julie Golob leading the way. There is nothing more empowering as a woman than to be able to understand how to protect yourself. As the old saying goes, “God made man and God made woman. Sam Colt made them equal.” Individual Responsibility: There were thousands of guns at the NRA annual meetings and not one jumped up and killed someone, imagine that. Each and every person who is a member of the NRA and attends the annual meeting understands the important and basic fundamental principle of individual responsibility, especially when it comes to owning a firearm. The NRA understands and promotes this idea through education, Refuse to Be a Victim courses, legal self-defense courses and more. Those who choose to participate in educating themselves about how firearms work and their proper use, only make themselves more responsible. After all, an educated gun owner is a responsible gun owner. Despite what we’ve heard from the politicians in Washington and the media elites living in ivory towers protected by armed guards, the NRA is in fact full of good people and does well to represent many of the values Americans hold dear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:25:22.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
