Would it be ever so hard to throw a Jake in the mix?” the student raps as an edited-in Fallon holds up the letter “J” in the background.\nTurns out, Fallon’s team saw the video — and it worked!\nThe Tonight Show ‘s official account tweeted to Sirianni on Wednesday, “We saw your video! Check out the show tonight.”\nIntroducing our newest summer intern! #FallonTonight pic.twitter.com/KsaZ5BNq9h \n— Fallon Tonight (@FallonTonight) March 23, 2017 \n\nThat’s where Fallon himself announced he was offering him the gig.\n“Jake, if you’re watching, and you better be watching — pack your bags, buddy! I’ll see you this summer,” the comic revealed. “I can’t wait to meet you, man. Get ready to work!”\nFROM COINAGE: The Most Expensive TV Shows of All Time \nLooking for a good rhyme for Stephanopoulos\n— Jake Sirianni (@JakeSirianni) February 12, 2017 \n\nAccording to King 5 , Sirianni got his idea from another creative intern of Fallon’s who got the job by remaking the show’s opening. It took him a week and a half to write the lyrics, three hours of shooting the video and an “inordinate” number of hours editing to make the final product.\nSo no more complaining about cover letters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T15:20:40.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
