Chuck Schumer got an earful from a first term senator, who charged him with reneging on a promise to hold a vote for the CIA director nominee by Inauguration Day.\n“This is bulls—,” a furious Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told the top Democrat in the Senate in an encounter on the Senate floor Friday night, according to the Weekly Standard. \n“We need to take this out into the hallway,” Schumer responded, urging his colleague to clam down.\n“Don’t tell me to lower my voice!” Cotton yelled back.\nThe scuffle came when Republicans believed they had struck a deal with Schumer, in which they agreed to delay the vote on the CIA director until Inauguration Day in exchange for holding three confirmation votes that day to fill national security positions in President Trump’s cabinet.\n“I said that I would not block him,” Schumer told Cotton.\n“I never said that I could speak for 47 other Democrats,” he added, suggesting the vote on Mike Pompeo would have to wait until Monday — three days after the Inauguration.\nWhen Schumer complained that Republicans hadn’t been so courteous to President Obama at the start of his presidency, Cotton replied, “Eight years ago, I was getting my ass shot at in Afghanistan.”\nSEE ALSO \nMike Pompeo sworn in as CIA director :0 WASHINGTON — Mike Pompeo was sworn in Monday night as...

Pompeo’s confirmation on Friday, but any other senator could ask for more debate, as they’re entitled to do,” House said.\nAs for the idea that Schumer could speak for other senators, he added:\n“That’s not how the senate works and they know it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:13:36.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
