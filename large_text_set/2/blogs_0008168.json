Further inland, temperatures will reach up to 47C. But he had some better news for South Australians. \n“We’re still seeing a large part of the eastern half of Australia that’s going to be extremely hot, the good news is though, in South Australia we are seeing a bit of a change start to push through from the southern coast,” Burke told the ABC. \n“Adelaide today will reach 34 degrees, but we will see some cooler winds push through later today.” \nBurke described the fire conditions as the most dangerous we’ve seen all summer. He said the heat will start to ease from tomorrow.
