And we mean that in the literal sense. Coach based most of their Spring 2017 collection around the floral pattern. Plus, actress Emma Roberts has us putting on our rose-colored glasses to get the full experience of her Coach Spring 2017 dress and our world has been changed for the better.\nRoberts wore a rose-pattered mini dress with sheer black sleeves and lace details. Although it’s from the spring collection, the black accents add a gothic element to the dress. This piece could easily work for fall and winter as well.\nMatched with her new light auburn locks, Roberts was a vision in red.

With a dress as cool as this, you don’t need to go overboard with the accessories!\nThe floral pattern does all the talking.

We’re digging Carpenter’s red leather jacket with lace details and brass studs. She paired the jacket with another of Coach’s sheer rose maxi dresses.\nGetty Images / Presley Ann Slack And later Roberts caught up with her bestie, Brit Elkin (who was also wearing a Coach Spring 2017 piece), for Valentine’s Day. She posted a photo of the two of them on her Instagram, captioning the pic, “happy to be spending it with the Gayle to my Oprah. The Busy to my Michelle and the Peet to my Paulson.”\nHappy Valentine's Day ❤happy to be spending it with the Gayle to my Oprah.

Maybe we can get Coach and AHS to collaborate for next season. Let’s get it trending!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:10:59.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
