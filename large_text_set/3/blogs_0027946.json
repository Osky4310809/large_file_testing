Throughout my career as a character designer and visual development artist, I have learned that having a strong respect and understanding of the process and fundamentals is essential to becoming a better artist, and what&apos;s more fundamental than a pencil?\nBefore you start you need to decide upon the best pencil for your drawing style. Next, follow my seven fundamental tips for next-level pencil drawing , and take a look at the video above demonstrating these techniques in action.

Pencil grip \nThink of the pencil as charcoal in a wooden sheath When I draw, I use not the tip but the side of the lead in order to maximise its utility. Holding my pencil like I would charcoal also keeps it sharper longer. When covering large areas, I shade with my pencil perpendicular to the line I&apos;m drawing to get wide, soft lines; for details, I hold my pencil parallel to my lines to get sharp, narrow marks. The only time I use the point is when I&apos;m working on intricate details.\n02. Shading techniques \nShading with unified lines versus with patches I like to shade in two main ways: the first is with all of my lines going in the same direction, which makes my shading appear more cohesive. This pencil drawing technique also helps my details pop out from the lines I&apos;m using for shading.\nThe second method I use is working in patches, which help define shape. Patches of lines go around the form, which help keep things in perspective. This technique is also great for backgrounds and adding texture.\n03. Line weight \nLine weight can help define solidity and volume The next drawing technique concerns line weight. Having control over my line weight is a great way to separate objects from one another, and can help emphasise shadows. Thicker lines can fade and disappear into the shadows, which can help convey the 3D form.\nI try to avoid outlining my drawings because this tends to make things look flat and deadens the 3D effect. Breaks and spaces in my lines show form in the lights and shadows.\n04. Sketch language \nUse light lines to explore and dark lines to commit When I start drawing, I plan and explore using loose lines, and avoid committing too early with hard, dark lines. As I progress my lines will change; checking and rechecking my work is vital. I darken my lines and add details at the end. I don&apos;t focus on one area for too long to prevent overdrawing.\nWhen drawing something symmetrical, I focus on the spaces between the lines, and of course keep reevaluating as I go along.\n05. Check and recheck \nListen if your gut is telling you something is off When I've checked my drawing, I check again. I have to nail down its underpinnings before I can add details. I really avoid guessing at the details; I want to make sure things are symmetrical and look right before putting down stronger and harder lines. I constantly ask myself, does this feel right? If anything seems off – even if I can't immediately put my finger on what it is – I trust my gut and troubleshoot my drawing before continuing.\n06. Final tricks \nPut a piece of paper under your hand to prevent smudges This is a valuable beginner&apos;s tip: I always put a piece of paper under my hand to keep from smudging my drawing.\nI also like to view my drawing in a mirror, through a camera, or step away from it. This way, I can get different vantage points on my drawing and detect if anything is off. \n07. Is it ever finished? \nIs this finished? Maybe… Like every other artist I know, even after I&apos;ve signed my name, I will sometimes continue tinkering with my drawings. I can always find something to change if I look hard enough, so it can be difficult to tell when a piece is truly finished.\nBut remember that a drawing can be overdone! Eventually, I make a conscious decision to put my drawing away and start something new. That&apos;s when I consider my drawing done. Well, maybe…\nI hope these pencil drawing techniques have helped – join in the conversation by adding your tips and tricks in the comments.\nRelated articles: \nCreate abstract backgrounds: 12 top tips Mix more realistic-looking colours Review: PoseBook 3D app ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T14:00:09.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
