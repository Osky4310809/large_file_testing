The shed where Kyzer was found (Photo: PA) \nMr Emlyn Jones, prosecuting, told Kingston Crown Court today: “In the garden shed, officers found a cardboard box wrapped in a black bin liner. \n“Inside the box was a laundry bag containing an object wrapped entirely in grey adhesive tape. \n“The tape was cut. Inside was the decomposed remains of a human child.

It also had one leg entirely bandaged from foot to hip.” \nDespite two post mortems and the long-term deterioration of her son Kyzer's remains, the cause of his death has been given as \"unascertained\". \nGayle was sentenced to 21 months and will remain on licence for 12 months on release, reports the Daily Record . The cardboard box where little Kyzer was found (Photo: PA) \nThe remains of Kyzer were only discovered in an investigation into the death of Gayle's two-year-old daughter Ava last year. \nGayle initially kept the dead baby in a bedroom full of junk before moving him to her mother's shed in West Hendon, north London after she was evicted. \nShe at first told police she had not seen Kyzer for a decade, claiming that he was living with his father, but later changed her account, and said she found him dead in his cot one morning. \nThe mother had also researched 'sulphuric acid' on the internet in the weeks leading up to his discovery – but she insisted she was curious after developing a rash from bleach.
