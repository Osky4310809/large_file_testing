Please join us in congratulating the Americas top 100 Arena players for the month of February! These are last month’s best performing Arena players based off of their average wins per run with a minimum of 30 runs. \nDeveloper's Notes: \nUPDATE: An error was discovered, and this month's top 100 rankings have been corrected below. \nStarting in March, we’ll be ranking players by best wins per run in any 30 consecutive runs as opposed to best wins per run in all arena runs. We think this will help in two ways. As with all things arena, this is something we’re going to try out for March and look forward to any feedback the community might have on this new format. When players reach a 30 run count they are happy with, there is no downside in continuing to play arena that month. Players should be less motivated to create a new account when they feel they had a few bad runs to start the month off. \nCheck back next month for March's Top 100!
