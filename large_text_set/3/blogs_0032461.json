(Bollywood Hungama) \nThis is a season of heroine driven average films. Last week it was Phillauri that grossed 4 crore on the first day of opening with a prediction of 25 to 30 crore in lifetime. This week it is Naam Shabana which is an action thriller that is a prequel to Akshay Kumar ‘s Baby. Latter had featured Taapsee Pannu in a key role and had placed her firmly on the Bollywood map. Naam Shabana is a reward of sorts for Taapsee who has managed to establish her credentials over the years, especially with Pink doing quite well last year. Now that she is leading the show for Naam Shabana, one expects the film to open on the same lines as other films of this genre in the Box Office. \nSo if we go by the collections of recent heroine-driven action films , Naam Shabana will also make around 30 crore. considering it has been given 2.5 stars by most reviewers, it is unlikely to gross beyond 30 to 35 crore in its lifetime. And that would be good enough for it to qualify as an earner. \nWatch this also: \n\nAs things stand today, Naam Shabana should take an opening around the Rs. 4 crore mark and anything over and above that would be an added bonus for the film. Amongst all the films that have been mentioned here, it was Pink and Neerja that had seen maximum growth, and eventually managed to collect Rs. 68 crore and Rs. 75.65 crore in their lifetime. It is definitely not a superhit, for now the makers would be content to see the film go past the Rs. 30 crore mark as that would be enough to help it qualify it as an earner.
