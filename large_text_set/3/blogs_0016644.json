Learn more about the Princess of Graceland's current hell. Posted on Mar 20, 2017 @ 6:58AM \nAfter losing custody of her kids and blowing a chunk of the $1 billion fortune her dad Elvis left her, desperate pill-popping Lisa Marie Presley has crawled back to Scientology, where’s she’s being brainwashed and kept like a prisoner, sources say. \n“She realized it was the only way to turn her life around,” a source told Radar. “ Things had gotten so toxic and out of control , it was the only answer in terms of a solution to all her problems.” \nBut as former member and King of Queens star Leah Remini has revealed on her explosive A&E series, Scientology and the Aftermath , the space-alien cult uses bullying and subversive tactics to keep control of members. \nPHOTOS: Xenu, Thetans & Auditing — Oh My! 30 Celebrity Scientologists Exposed \nA second source said cult bigwigs have taken advantage of messed-up Lisa Marie’s “vulnerable” state and have “brainwashed her to think she can’t manage her life on her own.” \nShe’s now being watched over like a prisoner because they convinced her she “needs to be babysat,” the source said. \nThey don’t want a repeat of what happened years ago when Lisa Marie bolted from the cult and bad-mouthed sect gurus, accusing them of milking her fortune and ­trying to control her life. \nPHOTOS: Thetan Hatin’! From Tom & Katie To Kirstie & Maksim — Hollywood Stars Face Off Over Controversial Scientology Beliefs \nIronically, those are the same charges she leveled against fourth hubby Michael Lockwood when she filed for divorce in June. The 55-year-old musician is also being investigated in a kiddie porn scandal after Lisa Marie accused him of having inappropriate photos. \nThen, Lisa Marie dashed to a Malibu rehab center known for treating celebs so she could beat her pill-popping habit and get her head on straight. \nAfter getting out, her actress-daughter Riley Keough , 27, star of The Girlfriend Experience and also a Scientologist, got her to check into the sect’s detox center Narconon Arrowhead and brought her mom into the fold. \nPHOTOS: Leah Remini Exposes Scientology’s ‘Biggest Secret’ \nA rep for Lisa Marie denied the story, but a second source added: “Her daughter was the one who got her back. After filing for divorce Lisa was ­living with Riley and now they’re back in Scientology .” \nMeanwhile, California child welfare officials took Lisa Marie and Michael’s eight-year-old twin girls Harper and Finley away and gave them to the care of their grandmother Priscilla , also a Scientologist. \nLisa Marie’s return to the Scientology fold is “a win-win” for the troubled space cult, said the source. “They’re desperate to improve their reputation in Hollywood,” reveals the source. \n“The whole Leah ­Remini exposé has done major ­damage, so to patch things up with Lisa Marie and have her back on board is obviously a huge coup. \n“It’s highly doubtful she’ll have to pay for treatment — they’ll throw it in free of charge for the whole family.” \nWe pay for juicy info!
