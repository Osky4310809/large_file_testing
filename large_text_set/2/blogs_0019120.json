Hailed as a musical genius, he had talents and fame by the bucketload, but that wasn’t enough to keep him alive. Since his death in 1994, the world hasn’t been the same, and no matter how many years go by, we’ll still wish he could come back from the dead and rejoin Nirvana.\nHis wife Courtney Love is one of many who does everything she can to keep his memory alive. In a heartfelt Instagram post, she shared a picture of their daughter Frances Bean Cobain when she was only a toddler.\n@space_witch666 remember when you were just a babe ? Your daddy would be proud of you ! I love you to the moon and galaxies beyond bean xxxx mama \nA post shared by Courtney Love Cobain (@courtneylove) on Feb 20, 2017 at 10:55pm PST \n“remember when you were just a babe ? Your daddy would be proud of you !” she writes. Our hearts are broken all over again.\nThe first thing you see in Frances’ young face is the resemblance to her late father. They have the same mouth and chin, and they even have the same curious look on their face, like they’re on the verge of discovering something special for the world to see. If you look at another one of Courtney’s throwback photos, you’ll see the resemblance staring you in the face.\nmaking a wish \nA post shared by Courtney Love Cobain (@courtneylove) on Jul 9, 2016 at 1:27am PDT \nAnd then there’s this picture that will make even the most heartless of folks tear up with nostalgia.\nSometimes the best and worst times of your life can coincide. It is a talent of the soul to discover the joy in pain—-thinking of moments you long for, and knowing you’ll never have them again. The beautiful ghosts of our past haunt us, and yet we still can’t decide if the pain they caused us out weighs the tender moments when they touched our soul. This is the irony of love. 'Shannon L. Alder' #love #canyouseeus ? \nA post shared by Courtney Love Cobain (@courtneylove) on Jul 9, 2016 at 1:49am PDT \n“Sometimes the best and worst times of your life can coincide,” Courtney writes. “It is a talent of the soul to discover the joy in pain—-thinking of moments you long for, and knowing you’ll never have them again.” It’s a quote from author Shannon L. Alder, and it’s like it was made to describe the life and death of Kurt Cobain .\nFrances is 24 years old today, and she’s a visual artist. Wherever she is and whatever she’s doing, we’re sure she’s keeping her dad’s memory alive and well.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:39:41.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
