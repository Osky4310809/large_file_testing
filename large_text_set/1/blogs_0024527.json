If you’re unfamiliar with the Lunar New Year, allow us to break it down. The Lunar New Year, also known as the Chinese New Year or the Spring Festival, is celebrated by many countries in Asia and is one of, if not the biggest holidays. It commemorates the beginning of a new year and of Spring, based around the moon’s cycle, as opposed to calendar date as done with the traditional New Year. There are twelve animals that represent the 12-year animal zodiac cycle that corresponds with the Chinese calendar; each animal has a different set up beliefs surrounding luck, wealth, health, etc. for that year. Given New York City’s diverse population, there will be plenty of Lunar New Year celebrations happening throughout the boroughs during the next week. Below is a list of a few worth checking out.
