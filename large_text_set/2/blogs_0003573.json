Predictably, the old truck didn’t stand a chance against the new one in a straight line, with the 3.5 litre twin-turbo V6 making short work of the 6.2 litre Boss V8. \nIn terms of numbers, the EcoBoost dishes out 450 hp and 691 Nm of torque, an increase of 39 hp and 103 Nm from the old Raptor. The new truck also gets Ford’s 10-speed automatic transmission, while the old one is merely a six-speed unit. More notably, the new model is up to 226 kg lighter than its predecessor. \nHowever, the drag race video isn’t exactly a fair comparison, as the 2017 Raptor is a SuperCab variant, making it smaller and lighter than the four-door SuperCrew 2014 SVT Raptor it is going up against. Even so, we reckon a four-door 2017 Raptor would still win such a race. \nGALLERY: 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor Research Ford Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:13:13.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
