According to a report from The Investor , smartphone manufacturers will soon be required to immediately submit a report if one of their devices either catches fire or explodes.\nAdditionally, companies will then have to launch an investigation right away in order to find out exactly what caused the incident in hopes of fixing the problem and making sure it doesnâ€™t happen again. The ministry will officially announce the new regulations on February 6, which will then be implemented within the next 12 months.\nSee also: Verizon plans to block outgoing calls on remaining Galaxy Note 7 units 2 weeks ago Along with the new regulations, the ministry will also announce the results of its own Galaxy Note 7 investigation it conducted with the help of the state-run Korea Test Laboratory. We expect that the results will be more or less the same as the ones already released by Samsung. A couple of weeks ago, the tech giant shared the results of its investigation with the public saying that Galaxy Note 7 devices exploded because of faulty batteries.\nSamsung has already announced its new quality assurance measures, including an 8-step battery safety check , that will hopefully prevent similar incidents in the future. However, it is still nice to see that Korean regulators have decided to implement additional safety regulations, which might eventually be introduced in other countries around the world as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T15:20:39.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
