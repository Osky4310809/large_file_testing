I love that we are now joining together, both at very different points,” said Seinfeld. “I am also very excited to be working with Ted Sarandos at Netflix, a guy and a place that not only have the same enthusiasm for the art of stand-up comedy as I do but the most amazing technology platform to deliver it in a way that has never existed before. I am really quite charged up to be moving there.”\nAs his quote indicates, this new pact not only includes Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee , but also a promised two stand-up specials as well as the ability to develop more scripted and unscripted fare.\nFor more TV news, check out the 12 new shows that you’ve got to watch this year . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:08:49.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
