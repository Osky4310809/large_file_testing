Then, they planned to hold said cameras for ransom. \nInteresting. \nFrom CBS News : \nCBS News learned on Wednesday night of a security threat to the president’s inauguration last month. Hackers managed to disable much of the vast network of security cameras in Washington, D.C., and hold them for ransom. \nEight days before President Trump was sworn in, hackers breached traffic and security cameras around Washington, D.C. The cameras were part of the security setup for the inauguration and were being monitored at an FBI command center. \nThere are 187 cameras in the city — monitoring everything from the White House to the Capitol to the inaugural parade route — and about 70 percent of them had been commandeered. \nChris Caruso is leading the investigation for the Secret Service. \nWho were these hackers? \nSeems like a relevant question, no? \nA lone wolf? The North Koreans? WHO? \nUltimately, nothing bad happened on January 20th and for that, we can all be thankful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:07:14.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
