Last week, this sad dog, Cesur, lost his human. 79-year-old, Mehmet Ilhan, passed peacefully in a hospital in Turkey, and his sidekick was notably dejected. “When my father was in the hospital during his last days, Cesur stopped eating.” 2 \nWhen his family finally brought his body home, Cesur would not leave his side. The day of the funeral, the pooch led the funeral procession all the way to where Mehmet’s grave was located. According to Mehmet’s son, Ali, “Nobody could touch him until my father was taken to the grave and was buried.” 3 \nMahmet’s son brought the dog home, but for the last five days since the funeral Cesur continued returning to his owner’s grave. “The people who work in the cemetery say the first thing he does in the morning is visit the grave of my father.” 4 \nMehmet’s son swore to do everything in his power to comfort the grieving pet: “Cesur has always been a noble animal,” said Ali. “He will live with me from now on.” 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:39:00.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
