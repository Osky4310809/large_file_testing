This was undoubtedly a saucy nod to President Trump. \nA wide range of hairstyles (hi-top fade, natural curls, an undercut, and more) were represented throughout the empowering black-and-white ad. It was designed to show how beautiful — and important – diversity is in the United States. \n\"Now is the time for us to come together. This ad captures the true diversity within American culture – we are all perfectly imperfect in our own way,\" shared Carolyn Aronson, Founder and CEO of It's a 10 Haircare in a press release. \nWatch now to be moved by the inspiring video and all the incredible styles.
