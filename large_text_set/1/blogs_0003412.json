Naturally, Keaton’s work as the Caped Crusader came up. He acknowledged to the trade that at its infancy, the Batman franchise wasn’t guaranteed to be a smash. “If it went down, we were going down in a big way,” said Keaton. The actor says it was the script for the first post-Burton Batman film that had him heading for the exit.\n“It sucked,” Keaton says of the script he was shown. “I knew it was in trouble when he [Joel Schumacher] said, ‘Why does everything have to be so dark?'”\nDid they include in the script that “Kiss From A Rose” would be on the soundtrack? That’d be enough to get its hooks into some people. Anyway, Keaton turning down Batman Forever can be interpreted as a good sign for what he must think of the script for this summer’s Spider-Man: Homecoming . COULD THIS BE THE MULTIPLICITY /MARVEL CROSSOVER EVENT DESTINED TO HEAL THE NATION??? Probably not, but we’re still excited.\n(Via The Hollywood Reporter )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:40:18.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
