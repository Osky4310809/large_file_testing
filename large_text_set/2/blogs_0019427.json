By: FE Online | Published: February 21, 2017 1:11 PM Pulsar Suni is the main accused in the Malayalam actress molestation case. (PTI) \nKerala High Court defers Pulsar Sunil’s bail plea hearing to March 3rd. For those who aren’t aware, Pulsar Suni is the main accused in the Malayalam actress molestation case which has shaken the nation and raised serious concerns about the safety of women in Kerala. The reason cited by the bench for postponing Pulsar Sunil’s bail plea is that it did not want the move to affect the police investigation. Last evening, Pulsar Sunil’s counsel EC Paulose had told local TV news reporters that he had submitted ”evidence” to the court to prove his innocence and the court has accepted the documents with a memo. \nHe further said that the documents included a passport and a white mobile phone, the details of which he did not know about. While speaking to TV news reporters, Pulsar Sunil’s counsel emphasized that they would co-operate with the investigation and pose no hurdle as Suni is innocent in this case. This high-profile case has caught the attention of the nation as it raised serious concerns about the safety of women. The general sentiment seemed to be that if this is how unsafe it is for a popular actress, what is the ground reality like for ordinary women in the state? Questions are being raised about what specific initiatives are being taken by the Kerala government to strengthen the safety of women. \nAlso Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:08:02.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
