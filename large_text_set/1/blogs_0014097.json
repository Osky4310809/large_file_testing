Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Wilkins was arrested after paying an undercover officer to arrange for him to have sex with a boy in Palm Springs \nWilkins had set up an online site enabling him to arrange to meet boys, and had made the journey to the US after a man apparently offered him sex with his two sons. \nWhen that plan failed to materialise, Wilkins fell prey to a sting operation set up by undercover agents. \nThey contacted him via the online group administered by Wilkins, and used by people with a \"sexual interest in children\". \nHe paid one of the agents $250 (£204) for sex with a nine-year-old Mexican boy in Palm Springs. \nBut the boy did not exist and Wilkins was arrested on 11 February after handing over the money for his \"share\" in the child. \nWilkins denied four charges of travelling with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, attempted sex trafficking of children, possession of child pornography and transportation of child pornography. \nIn September he pleaded guilty to the latter charge under a plea agreement with the US Attorney's Office. \n\"This defendant persistently engaged in the sexual exploitation of children,\" said United States Attorney Eileen M Decker. \n\"Today's sentence ensures that children will be protected from his abhorrent conduct for many years.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:31:06.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
