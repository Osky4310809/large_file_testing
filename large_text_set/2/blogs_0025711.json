She was probably going through this all alone, and you think no matter how hard-headed you are. \nI knew people were probably just tearing her down, so I just wanted to let her know, like, ‘Try not to look at it, let it pass. It will slow down.’ ABC \nCorinne is still currently competing on Nick Viall’s season of “The Bachelor,” but tell me it’s farfetched to imagine Chad Johnson and Corinne Olympios hooking up on the next season of “Bachelor in Paradise.” \nI’ll wait.
