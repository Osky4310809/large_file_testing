While the state government described the dismissal of the police personnel as a tragic day for professionalism, the state APC maintained that the development was an indictment on the state governor. Rivers State Commissioner for Information and Communication, Dr. Austin Tam-George, said in a statement issued on Friday, that the state government was sad over the decision of the Nigeria Police Force to dismiss the police personnel. According to Tam-George, “The Rivers State Government notes with infinite sadness the decision of the Nigeria Police to dismiss six police personnel attached to Governor Nyesom Wike. “The police personnel were subjected to a secret and unfair trial on totally fictitious charges of professional misconduct during the rerun elections in Rivers State on the 10th of December 2016. This is a tragic day for professionalism and the respect for human rights in the Nigeria Police Force.” The Information commissioner explained that the dismissed officers committed no crime by foiling an orchestrated electoral heist by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission in collusion with the All Progressives Congress and the Nigeria Police Force. He also described the claim by the police that the affected officers misused their firearms while in Wike’s convoy on December 10, 2016 as a wrong and cruel fabrication. Tam-George said, “Governor Wike did not depart from his official premises on the day of the election and therefore, had no use for an armed convoy. “Two days after the elections, on the 12th of December 2016, thousands of Rivers people led by Governor Wike resisted an invasion by the police on the premises of the Port Harcourt City Local Government Council in a brazen attempt to rig the elections in favour of the APC. “Throughout the period of the stand-off between the invading police officers and the thousands of citizens who resisted them, Governor Wike and the officers around him conducted themselves with utmost restraint.” He, however, urged Nigerians to demand the immediate reinstatement of the dismissed officers, and urged the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Ibrahim Idris, to allow an independent inquiry. But the State APC Publicity Secretary, Mr. Chris Finebone, pointed out that the fate of the six police personnel was a tip of the iceberg of the offences that were committed by Wike. He said, “The dismissal of those six policemen is a clear indictment of Governor Nyesom Wike over his violation of electoral regulations in the December 10, 2016 rerun elections in Rivers State.” Copyright PUNCH.
