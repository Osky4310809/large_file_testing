It’s killing people’s minds, in a way.\nAll of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news. We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press, but we must also help the reader. Too many of us are just in the ‘complain’ category right now and haven’t figured out what to do.\nCook called on information companies to create messaging campaigns to counter fake news. He also said governments need to take the lead with their own campaigns.\nWe need the modern version of a public service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly, if there is a will.\nIt has to be ingrained in the schools, it has to be ingrained in the public. There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic... It’s almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid.\nIn some ways kids will be the easiest to educate. At least before a certain age, they are very much in listen and understand [mode], and they then push their parents to act. We saw this with environmental issues: kids learning at school and coming home and saying why do you have this plastic bottle? Why are you throwing it away?\nConcern about fake news came to the fore of public discourse after Donald Trump won the presidency, but a study by Stanford and New York University showed that it didn’t help Trump and that “the impact of fake news on the election appears to have been greatly exaggerated.”\nRegardless, calls for cracking down on “fake news” have been gaining steam, especially among liberals who are also calling for a “ resistance ” movement against the Trump administration. They say they have a plan to “battle against Trump’s authoritarian impulses and serial shredding of our democratic norms” and “against the various ways in which Trump will work with Republicans to advance a more conventional GOP agenda.”\nThe Media's Credibility Gap\nPart of that effort is to crack down on fake news and promote information that will “save the civil society.” Or so say the progressives. Unfortunately, the Left is just as guilty of spreading fake news as the Right, a point made by Robinson Meyer at the Atlantic .\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/13/apple-ceo-tim-cook-fake-news-is-killing-peoples-minds/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/02/10/a-blueprint-for-resistance-to-trump-has-emerged-heres-what-it-looks-like/?utm_term=.26f795dd3472", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/02/10/fake-news-killing-peoples-minds-says-apple-boss-tim-cook/", "http://www.universityherald.com/articles/63151/20170131/stanford-new-york-university-study-proves-fake-news-trump-win.htm", "https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/02/viva-la-resistance-content/515532/"], "published": "2017-02-13T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:26:36.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
