A picture of Khalid Masood taken for his driving licence (Metropolitan Police) \nJanet Ajao, 69, gave a statement through police in which she spoke of her distress at discovering her son had been the maniac who ploughed through pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer to death. \n“I am so deeply shocked, saddened and numbed by the actions my son has taken that have killed and injured innocent people in Westminster,” she said. \n“Since discovering that it was my son that was responsible I have shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident.” Masood was fatally shot by police outside Parliament (Stefan Rousseau/PA ) \n“I wish to make it absolutely clear, so there can be no doubt, I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity.” \nOn Monday police investigating Wednesday's attack said they do not believe Masood - previously known as Adrian Ajao - was directed by Islamic State or al-Qaeda.
