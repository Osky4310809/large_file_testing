Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, traveled to Mexico as part of a congressional delegation last weekend to meet with members of the Mexican cabinet, Senate, and civil society. Senator Markey also visited the U.S.-Mexico border to assess security and counter-narcotics operations, as well as the apprehension, detention, and treatment of undocumented migrants crossing into the United States. Other members of the delegation included Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the Committee’s Ranking Member, and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).

In particular, environmental and labor standards and focusing on policies that will help workers impacted by free trade were key parts of the conversation. \nAttorney General Raul Cervantes Andrade hosted the Senators for a conversation about Mexico’s efforts to combat drug trafficking and improve security, as well as bilateral cooperation on extraditions. The conversation also focused heavily on the lethal synthetic drug fentanyl, which increasingly finds its way into heroin after an illicit path from China to Mexico to the United States.

I thank them for their service and pledge to work with them to get the resources they need to do their jobs.‎” \n\nThe Senators also met with their counterparts in the Mexican Senate: Gabriela Cuevas, Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee; Marcela Guerra, Chair of the North American Relations Committee; Adriana Davila, Chair of the Committee on Human Trafficking, and Juan Gerardo Flores Ramírez, member of the Foreign Relations Committee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:19:20.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
