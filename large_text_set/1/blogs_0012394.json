And that doesn’t include a Rockledge Road home, which just sold for a record-setting $23 million. \nLast year at this time? “It was very quiet last January,” said Julie Bergsten, vice president of operations and finance for Slifer Smith & Frampton. \nA lull hit the luxury housing market last year in many of Colorado’s ski towns. In the summer, real estate brokers in Aspen called it a nosedive as Pitkin County’s sales volume fell 42 percent from the prior year. But post election, activity appears to be ramping up. \n“Hangover from the recession maybe? I do think the election had something to do with it. Whenever there is instability, those buyers wait to see what’s going to happen,” said Bergsten, who categorizes homes as “luxury” if they are least $3 million. “If it feels uncertain, they’ll hold onto their cash and see what happens.” Courtesy of Donna Caynoski The record-breaking sale of the 11,509-square foot, seven bedroom, eight bath ski-in, ski-out property on the site of an original 1962 Vail homestead, closed in January. \nEvidence that certainty is back in Eagle County, which includes Vail and Beaver Creek, is evident in the Multiple Listing Service, which is used by Realtors. Approximately 38 Eagle County homes priced at $3 million and higher sold between Sept. 1 and now, according to the MLS. During the same period the year before, 34 sold. While the volume was near the same, price tags bumped the total up 33 percent to $227 million, from $171 million the same period of 2016.
