According to Us Weekly , Caitlyn Jenner has accepted an invitation to attend the event, which will take place on January 20th. \nJenner is a republican, and over the summer she spoke at an LGBT event at the Republican National Convention, saying “I think our best move to get back to a constitutional government is in the Republican party. I won’t give up hope on it.” \nTrump has reportedly had trouble getting celebrities to perform at and attend the inauguration. Back in December, he seemingly refuted those claims when he tweeted that lots of A-Listers wanted to attend, but he wanted “the people.” \nThough most of the Kardashian/Jenner crew supported Hillary Clinton , it’s not entirely surprising Jenner would go- she and Trump seemingly have a good relationship, and while Vice President-Elect Mike Pence has been criticized for his anti-LGBT agenda, Trump seems to be more progressive in that way. He’s said that he doesn’t care which bathroom transgender people use, and Jenner famously used the women’s restroom at Trump Tower. \n[image via Helga Esteb / Shutterstock.com] \nHave a tip we should know?
