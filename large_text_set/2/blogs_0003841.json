He said: “Parliament must have a final say when we get to the end-game. \n“Mrs May has also said she would prefer 'no deal to a bad deal'. However, at present, there is no provision to give MPs a vote on this outcome.

But MPs would have no chance to say the Government should step back from the brink and return to the negotiating table.” \nR eports over the weekend suggested that as many as 27 Conservative MPs could rebel against the Prime Minister and back a series of amendments designed to prevent the bill from passing. \nFormer ministers Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve were among those reported to be considering a vote to modify the legislation alongside the veteran pro-European Ken Clarke who was the lone Tory to rebel at second reading.

If she gets a deal she will be back to the House of Commons - in fact both chambers - and there will be votes, and rightly so. \n\"But if there is no deal then the Government will determine what happens next. I think it should it come into Parliament. I don't know why people are so fearful of that.\" \nHowever a Conservative source claimed the real number is closer to 12 and some have yet to make up their mind either way about whether to back the votes.
