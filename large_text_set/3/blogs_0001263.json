Just a few days after that decision, Pittsburgh’s KDKA-TV reported that officials were planning to open a new coal mine in western Pennsylvania by the end of 2017.   \nCorsa Coal Corp. CEO George Dethlefsene credited the Trump administration for the decision to open the mine. \nHe said Trump’s construction and infrastructure plans “will (also) help steel demand, which is good for the coal industry.” \nIt seems as if Trump knows what he’s doing when it comes to energy, construction and infrastructure. While he still has many critics who say the roll-back of Obama-era regulations will be destructive, preliminary reports find that the results are actually quite the opposite. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and tell us if you think President Trump is the reason why the coal mining industry is booming again.
