Nancy Binay wants the Senate to investigate reportedly defective MRT coaches. Philstar.com/File photo MANILA, Philippines — Sen. Nancy Binay has filed a resolution for the Senate to investigate reports of defective Metro Rail Transit 3 coaches that were bought from a Chinese firm. On February 3, Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) party-list Rep. Jericho Jonas Nograles claimed that none of the new coaches delivered were working and that 12 of them have cracks. He did not say where he got the information. READ: ‘New MRT-3 coaches not working’ \"Kung totoo nga, bagong pahirap na naman ito sa ating mga commuters dahil maaantala lalo ang introduction to service ng mga tren,\" Sen. Binay said. She added that an inquiry is necessary to improve the services of the MRT and to make sure that passengers will be safe and that the operations will be efficient. The new coaches are part of 48 bought from the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Corp for P3.8 billion by the Department of Transportation and Communication — since reorganized and renamed the Department of Transportation — in 2013. Delivery of the coaches started in January 2016, three months later than the scheduled delivery of October 2015. \"Delayed na nga ang delivery ng mga coaches na ito, na dapat sana ay pamalit sa mga lumang coaches na prone na sa breakdowns,\" Binay said. She also noted the reported delays in the MRT service due to breakdowns, including one on Tuesday which caused a long line of passengers. \"Kahapon ng umaga ay may naiulat na breakdown ng MRT na kung saan umabot na sa kalsada ang pila ng mga commuters na naghihintay na makasakay,\" Binay said. She also pointed at service interruptions on the MRT throughout 2016. \"Ang nawawalang oras ng ating mga empleyado dahil lamang sa breakdowns ng MRT ay kawalan din ng productivity sa ating mga kumpanya,\" Binay said.
