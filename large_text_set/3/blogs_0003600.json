We don't WANT to cover this, but so many have discussed this issue that it must be addressed. \nPeeps Oreos , pictured above, are seemingly innocent. Artificial, yes, but pretty tasty â€” we gave them a fair review! But some people are claiming there's an unpleasant (and rather embarrassing) side effect: Peeps Oreos are turning their poop pink. \nI KNOW. \nSo gross, and how does that even happen? Well, for starters, let's discuss another claim people are making: that the Oreos turn your saliva pink, too. As people who have in fact eaten a couple of the cookies, we can vouch for this. Eating the bright-pink frosting does indeed coat your tongue in a vibrant pink hue. Now, to achieve pink poop , you'd have to eat nearly an entire package, right? It seems the people whose bowel experiences have turned to the dark (pink) side did actually eat a whole package.
