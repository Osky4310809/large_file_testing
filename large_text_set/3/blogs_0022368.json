In fact, Alexa is expected to bring $11 billion in revenue for Amazon by 2020 , and s mart speaker shipments are predicted to be over 24 million this year , compared to a mere 6.5 million last year.\nGoogle Home is Amazon Echo’s biggest rival right now, offering the best of Google’s services at a much lower price. Well, the search giant is sweetening the pot by giving you a $30 discount when you buy two Google Home devices. If you have a big house, this might be perfect for you since Google Home devices can sync with one another for things like playing music.\nHead on over to Google’s official store , and once you select two Google Homes, you should see that the final price comes out to be $229, instead of $258. There is a limit to how many Google Homes you can buy though: the maximum is two orders, meaning the maximum number of Google Homes per consumer is limited to four. Unfortunately, single unit purchases will remain at a regular $129.\nThe maximum is two orders, meaning the maximum number of Google Homes per consumer is limited to four.
