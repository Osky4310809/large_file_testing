Where will you be able to see the eclipse? \nThe eclipse will begin in Chile and pass over Argentina's Patagonia region before being visible across the South Atlantic Ocean and eventually in Angola. It will end near the border of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo at sunset. \nThis is the first of two solar eclipses happening in 2017. The second will occur over the USA on August 21.

When will the eclipse take place?

When is the next Solar Eclipse in the UK? \nWe won't see another eclipse over these shores until June 10 2021. \nThen a partial eclipse will take place across Britain ranging from 50% in northern Scotland to 30% in south-east England.
