Here's how things played out in the final round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational: \nLeaderboard : Marc Leishman (-11), Kevin Kisner (-10), Charley Hoffman (-10), Rory McIlroy (-9), Tyrrell Hatton (-9), Adam Hadwin (-8) \nWhat it means : Leishman is heading back to the Masters after winning his second career title at the API. Leishman was lurking behind Kisner and Hoffman all day, but the Aussie took control of the tournament with a 51-foot eagle putt on the par-5 16th. Leishman then made two great up-and-downs on 17 and 18 to secure the victory. \nRound of the day : Danny Lee went out early and fired a bogey-free 67 to move up from 39th place to T-17. \nBiggest disappointment : McIlroy briefly held the lead before a disappointing three-putt on 18 dropped him two strokes behind Leishman, but this distinction goes to the final group of Hoffman and Kisner who were both over par on Sunday. \nShot of the day : Leishman's eagle was incredible, but this shot by Zach Johnson was unreal: \nQuote of the Day: \"The putter's been amazing.\" – Leishman Article Tags: \nContributions from writers and editors on the Golf Channel Digital team.
