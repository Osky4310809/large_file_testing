At the time the article was written, Trump actually hadn’t spoken to Xi since November and The Times story was completely factual.\nThe article was updated late Thursday night once the White House released its readout of their newest call. The article now reads that Xi “ had not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov. 14, the week after he was elected,” and the headline was updated from “China’s President, Stung by Taiwan Call, Is Said to Shun Trump,” to “After Silence From Xi, Trump Endorses the ‘One China’ Policy.”\n[Image via screengrab]\n—\n>>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter\n tips@mediaite.com", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://newsdiffs.org/diff/1352278/1352303/www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html", "https://twitter.com/HashtagGriswold", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fdonald-trump-calls-new-york-times-fake-news-for-perfectly-accurate-reporting%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://twitter.com/nytimes", "https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/830047626414477312", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fdonald-trump-calls-new-york-times-fake-news-for-perfectly-accurate-reporting%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/trump-5-1.jpg&description=Donald%20Trump%20Calls%20New%20York%20Times%20%26%238216%3BFake%20News%26%238217%3B%20For%20Perfectly%20Accurate%20Reporting"], "published": "2017-02-10T17:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T16:24:59.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
