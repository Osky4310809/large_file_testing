The first Deadpool did a lot differently, though, joking about continuity, timelines, cameos, and more. Not only will that continue in Deadpool 2 , it’ll set the table for other X-Men movies to come. Advertisement \nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter , Deadpool and Deadpool 2 co-writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick explained that they are not staying beholden to any of the timelines established by any of the other X-Men movies. Here’s Reese: \nWhat’s nice is Deadpool exists in his own universe. He’s part of the larger X-Men universe, but in a way he isn’t. He interacts with that world but he is in the present. We don’t deal with the ‘60s or the ‘70s or the future. It’s here and now. More than anything, I think he’s going to have his fun with what they do in the other franchise. But fortunately, we don’t have to play by those same rules. Deadpool is a movie that did break all the rules. And I think we’re going to continue to break those rules. That involves knowing that he’s in a movie, talking to the audience, breaking that fourth wall, a characteristic that they established so brilliantly in the comics way back when. So yeah, I do think that timelines are something that we can make fun of and don’t have to be slave to. \nThat irreverence and rejection of the connected, Marvel Cinematic Universe standard, is going to continue in future movies too. Wernick added the following: Advertisement \nI think sometimes the movies get a little overstuffed trying to set up future movies and it almost feels burdensome or obligatory, where you are weaving in four or five different plots that really aren’t in service of the current movie, but are to set up audience anticipation or logic for what’s coming. We really are trying our best to avoid that. \nMore than that, the writers believe Deadpool 2 is going to establish a tone that fans can expect from those future movies, like New Mutants, X-Force, and others. A tone that will connect the films, not a story. Wernick continued: \nThe different universes tend to have different tones, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe has a very specific, genius tone that was set in Iron Man and has lived well beyond that into the other movies. DC tends to have its own tone, which is this dark, gritty tone. The X-Men have their own tone, which is kind of somewhere in between. Not too funny, not too light. But not quite as dark as the DC stuff. And I think what we stumbled into was a new tone, and I haven’t seen Logan , so it’s tough to say if they have it, but I think we hope to have our own universe that is defined less by characters and timelines and things like that and more by tone. The hope is Deadpool 2 and X-Force and future movies all be this new, consistent, sillier tone. More self-aware tone. And edgier and rated-R tone. \nNow, obviously, the irreverent tone from Deadpool worked. And the X-Men movies have gotten so crazy, maybe the best course of action is to just say “Screw it.” Don’t link them by story, just make good, solid, standalone movies. And if there’s a chance for a crossover? Go for it. If not, don’t. Marching to their own drum has worked so far, and it sounds like Deadpool 2 will establish that even further. Sponsored \nWill fans be okay with it, though? Will they be okay going to see Deadpool 2 or X-Force and not seeing a continuing story? Does this suggest they can just reboot the X-Men ? Most of these questions won’t be answered for years, but the first hints will likely be on television. Legion premieres on FX next month and another X-Men show has just been greenlit. These shows are not likely to link to the films so if audiences embrace those, maybe that will prove they can do the same for the films. \nRead more of the interview at The Hollywood Reporter link below. Deadpool 2 starts shooting in the coming months, aimed at a possible 2018 release date, but that is not confirmed.
