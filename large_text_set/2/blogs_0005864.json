And then, LeBron James did this.\nThat’s a banked three off the glass after a long pass form Kevin Love. Shades of Christian Laettner, but way, way better. He left 0.3 on the clock, but it may as well have been a buzzer beater.\nYeah, we’re stunned too. It also makes up for this comedy of errors on the previous possession. With the Cavaliers down one, James strolled in after a nice move on John Wall, took an obvious third step that went uncalled and blew the layup. Wall then hit two free throws, and that should have been it. But then LeBron atoned for his mistake in the most incredible way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:54:58.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
