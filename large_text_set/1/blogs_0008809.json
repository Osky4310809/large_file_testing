Elizabeth Warren, backed by 30 Democrats in the House and Senate, will try to change that. \nWarren is set to introduce legislation, straightforwardly titled, The President Conflict of Interest Act, that would require the president and vice president-elect, along with their spouses and dependent children, to divest their business holdings or risk impeachment . \n“The American people deserve to know that the President of the United States is working to do what’s best for the country—not using his office to do what’s best for himself and his businesses,” Warren said in a statement . “The only way for President-elect Trump to truly eliminate conflicts-of-interest is to divest his financial interests by placing them in a blind trust. This has been the standard for previous presidents, and our bill makes clear the continuing expectation that President-elect Trump do the same.” \nTrump has said in recent weeks that he would leave his large adult children in charge of his business holdings. He has called this executive shuffling a “blind trust.” It is not a blind trust . The announcement became still more absurd when each of those adult children received a spot on the president-elect’s transition team and, oh, started showing up to meetings with foreign heads of state. \nWarren’s bill would also require presidential and vice presidential candidates to release their tax returns, something that Trump never did . \nUnfortunately, the bill, a sharp indictment of the ways in which Trump appears to already be using the presidency to enrich himself and his family , will never, never ever, fucking ever pass the Senate, where Democrats hold just 48 seats .
