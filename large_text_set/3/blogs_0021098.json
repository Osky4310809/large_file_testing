The twin girls together had the weight of only one healthy baby, also had severe diaper rash and infected wounds.\nOwasso police were first alerted by the city's urgent care center, which reported suspected abuse based on the children's condition.\nA nurse there said maggots were present in one of the infant's genitals, reports KJRH. Feces were found in one of the child's ears.\nMiller blamed the condition of her children on lack of parental experience. She also told police that she didn't have health insurance and therefore neither child had been to a doctor since birth, reports the Tulsa World.\nThree of the children's grandparents -- Rita Fowler, 65, Johnny Miller, 47, and Cathey Miller, 54 -- were later arrested and charged with felony permitting child neglect and failing to report child neglect, a misdemeanor.\nSince mid-December, the twin girls and their two older siblings were removed from their parent's house and put in custody of the Department of Human Services.\nDuring March 20 preliminary hearing, DHS investigator Kristi Simpson described the babies' condition when hospitalized as \"shocking and heinous.\"\nDr. Michael Baxter testified before the Tulsa County District Court that the children were severely underweight for children their ages, with stunted development.\nA police detective testified that the maternal grandmother, Rita Fowler, had seen the children a month before their hospitalization and should have known they needed medical help but failed to act, citing that as the reason for her arrest.\nHer attorney argued to the contrary that there was no evidence that she had willfully ignored her granddaughters’ condition.\nAislyn Miller, Kevin Fowler, and Rita Fowler are due back in court on March 28 for trial court arraignment.\nJohnny Miller and Cathey Miller grandparents are scheduled to go before a judge on March 29 for their preliminary hearing.\nThe Children's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines neglect as \"the failure of a parent or other person with responsibility for the child to provide needed food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision to the degree that the child’s health, safety, and well-being are threatened with harm.\"\nThe agency also provides the most recent statistics: \"More than 538,000 children were neglected in 2010, accounting for about 78 percent of all unique victims of child maltreatment. In addition, neglect was either the sole cause or one of the contributors to over 68 percent of the 1,560 child maltreatment-related deaths in 2010.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:50:53.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
