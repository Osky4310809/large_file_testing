Jersey officer charged after leaving unsecured gun that killed daughter, 8, on New Year's Eve Updated: January 20, 2017 — 5:16 PM EST 130 Share \nMichael Boren writes about police and crime in South Jersey. More by Michael Boren Jan 19 \nA Stratford police officer has been suspended without pay for leaving a loaded and unsecured .357 revolver in reach of his 8-year-old daughter, who was fatally shot New Year’s Eve at the family’s home, authorities said Friday. \nKenneth Righter, 46, has been charged with endangering the welfare of a child and a disorderly-persons offense called “storage of firearms if minors may have access.” The gun, a personal weapon of Righter’s, was left on a shelf and was accessible to three children, including Sailor Lane Righter, who died, and her brothers, 14 and 17, authorities said. Sailor Lane Righter, of Stratford, was 8 years old. \nThe Camden County Prosecutor’s Office, which is leading the investigation, did not say whether Sailor or another family member fired the gun, but has said that only family members were home at the time. Kenneth Righter, who is paid $87,000 a year as a Stratford officer, was not home at the time of the shooting. \nRighter's attorney, Dennis Wixted, said Friday the charges have added to the family's stress and sadness over Sailor's loss. \n\"The entire Righter family is devastated,\" Wixted said. He declined to comment on details of the case. \nA 911 call from the Righter family's house on Union Avenue came around 1:50 p.m. on New Year's Eve. \n\" We need help now ,\" one of Sailor's siblings told a dispatcher, according to a recording of the call provided by county officials. The sibling did not give the dispatcher his name. \n\"My mom just went upstairs and found her, and she told me to call 911,\" he said. \"She's not breathing.\" \nHe then told the dispatcher the family was headed to the hospital. \nSailor was pronounced dead at Kennedy University Hospital in Stratford at 2:15 p.m., authorities said. Her mother brought her there. \nKenneth Righter became a Stratford police officer in 2004, according to the state Attorney General's Office. He passed firearms training several times in recent years, including last year, when he scored 100 percent with his personal revolver, according to qualification forms obtained through a public records request. That is the same weapon that authorities said killed Sailor. \nStratford's police department has guidelines on keeping a weapon at home. \n“Each full-time member of this police department shall be issued a secure gun-locking device, which without exception shall be utilized each day,” the guidelines state, adding, “Officers are encouraged to purchase a safe to further safeguard weapons.” \nThe department has 16 officers, including supervisors, according to its website. \nPolice Chief Ronald Morello said in a statement Friday that it is general policy to suspend any employees charged with an indictable crime. He said he could not comment on the investigation by the Prosecutor's Office. \nMayor Josh Keenan, who said he knows Righter, said, \"It's just a very sad situation that happened to his family, that's all. He's a good officer.\" \nRighter, if convicted, faces up to 10 years in prison for the child-endangerment charge, a second-degree crime, and up to six months in county jail for the disorderly-persons offense. \nDozens of people have commemorated Sailor on Facebook, where they posted pictures of snow angels in her memory after her Jan. 6 memorial service. A family friend also asked people to post pictures wearing red, saying Sailor loved Harley Quinn, a comic book character who was portrayed by Margot Robbie last year in the movie Suicide Squad . \nOn Sailor’s birthday, Sunday, family and friends released red balloons. \nSailor participated in the Sterling Lady Knights Cheerleading, a recreational squad, and was on its Mini Majesty team. \n\"She adored cheerleading and playing softball,\" her obituary said . \"She will be forever missed by her family.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T11:15:39.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
