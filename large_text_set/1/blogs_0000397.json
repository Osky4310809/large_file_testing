REUTERS/Osman Orsal 5401673 \nThe Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the shooting at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year’s Eve, which killed 39 people and injured nearly 70. \nThe ISIS-affiliated Aamaq News Agency released a message Monday saying the attack was carried out by a “heroic soldier of the caliphate who attacked the most famous nightclub where Christians were celebrating their pagan feast.” \nAamaq described Turkey as “the servant of the cross” and said the attack was “revenge for God’s religion and in response to the orders” from leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. \nThousands of officers are searching for the unidentified suspect behind the attack. Initial reports claimed the shooter wore a Santa suit during the attack, which was later denied by Prime Minister Binali Yildirim. Investigators assume the shooter changed clothes before fleeing the venue.
