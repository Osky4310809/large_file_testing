Now, try being the kind of frequent filmgoer who watches all the potential Oscar nominees, but invariably doesn’t get to see them as early as the critics and Oscar bloggers, who have already predetermined which ones you’re supposed to like and not like. It’s not so easy to admit to tastes that go against the grain…to the only other people who have actually seen these movies yet. \nSaturday Night Live literalized it last night, by having Aziz Ansari arrested for an incorrect opinion–namely, that La La Land isn’t the best thing ever. And when his objections didn’t prove to be absolutely airtight because he hadn’t paid attention to every detail? Well, that’s like debating Star Wars against somebody who knows the entire history of the Expanded Universe. \nInevitably, of course, the interrogator proved to be just as hypocritical and inconsistent, at least until Kenan Thompson showed up to voice an absolutely blasphemous opinion that Nerdist cannot and will never condone, despite our normally tolerant ways. You’ll know it when you hear it. \nWhat unpopular opinions would send you to movie jail? Which of your friends’ opinions do you think deserve a thorough interrogation to see if they’re of sound mind? and most importantly, what is your pick for most award-worthy movie of the year?
