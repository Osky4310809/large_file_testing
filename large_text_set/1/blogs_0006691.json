Others are sent off by dozens of scantily clad, pole-dancing strippers. Tung Hsiang went the latter way. Last month, after the Taiwanese politician passed away at age 76, his son had a dream in which Hsiang requested something “hilarious” for the funeral.\nEver faithful, he came through with the dreamed-about request, providing 50 ladies polishing poles with their bodies — a Taiwanese move for the dead that was originally initiated by gangsters honoring their own — a fleet of drummers and “performers dressed as deities and giant puppets,” as reported by the BBC .\nConsidering that this outré custom is not completely unusual in China and Taiwan, spectators took it in stride and gently joked about it. According to the BBC, one commented, “This is what it means to be the people’s counselor.” Another quipped, “The city’s residents are asking, ‘Please die one more time.’ ”\nWild as this final hoedown may be, it is not even the most outrageous send-off for a loved one. According to the Mirror , funeral-home owner Damaris Marin has come to recognize that “families wish to see the dead . . . just as they were when they were alive.”\nThat might explain why Puerto Rican boxer Christopher Rivera Amora celebrated his passing by having his body propped up in the corner of a constructed boxing ring, dressed in full fight-night regalia, ready to pose for photos alongside loved ones. Then there’s Billy Standley. He lived and died in Ohio, and was situated aboard his Harley-Davidson after dying, made to appear ready to take off for somewhere other than the afterlife. New Orleans socialite Mickey Easterling, though deceased, accepted respects while chilling out with cigarettes and Champagne. She looked as if she was dozing between an endless string of Big Easy bashes.\nWhile it’s tough to capture dead people at their ever-living best, that was the result for the body of Jesus Diaz Beato. He was shot 15 times before shuffling off his mortal coil and, once cleaned up for museumlike viewing, the man looked poised to spend eternity coolly relaxing on a chair.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:16:03.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
