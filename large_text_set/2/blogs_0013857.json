Its areas of expertise are science, technology, engineering and math, which you may recognize from the acronym STEM, which is a curriculum used by a lot of schools. \nSpringer describes itself as an \"e-first\" publisher, meaning most of its books are online before they're in hardcover. For free, Springer Link has about 50,000 downloadable STEM-related volumes. \nIf you're doing research, or helping your child with a school report, you can download a book like, \"Economics and Computation\" or \"Optimization for Decision Making,\" as a PDF file .
