If you receive a message called: black in the white house, even sent by a friend, do not open and shut down your machine immediately. It is the worst virus announced by CNN. A new virus has been discovered recently it has been classified by Microsoft as the virus most destructive ever. This virus was discovered yesterday afternoon by McAfee. And there is no repair yet for this kind of virus. This virus simply destroys the Zero Sector of the hard disk, where information vital function is stored. \nAnalysis: No such computer virus exists. These fake warnings are variants of a virus hoax that has circulated in many forms over the past two decades. \nPrevious versions include: \n• \"A Virtual Card for You\" Virus Warning• \"Invitation\" Virus Warning• \"Merry Christmas\" Virus Warning• \"Hallmark Postcard\" Virus Warning \nThese are all hoaxes — or, to be more precise, they're all versions of the same hoax. Following the advice of unsourced viral alerts like these is an ineffective, if not outright counter-productive, way of maintaining computer or network security. Protecting oneself from real virus and Trojan threats requires a few simple though critically important measures. \nFollow these religiously: Always be very careful opening email attachments and downloading files. If you can't be reasonably sure the source is trustworthy and the files are safe, don't open or download them. Maintain up-to-date antivirus software on your computer, configure it to detect trojan horses and other forms of malware automatically, and set it to scan for viruses and other threats regularly. Always be careful about clicking on outgoing links, especially in messages from anonymous or unfamiliar sources. Clicking on such links can instantly download malicious software to your computer. Again, if you can't be reasonably sure the source is trustworthy and the link is safe, don't click on it. \nSources and further reading:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:45:45.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
