Calvin Cooksey has filed suit against his R&B star son claiming that a Tumblr note Ocean posted following last summer’s Orlando nightclub shooting has cost him financial opportunities. \nIn the post, Ocean recounted a childhood experience in which his father had introduced him to a homosexual slur. “I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a faggot as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty,” the note read. “That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t.” \nAccording to TMZ , Cooksey says the story never happened. He claims that as a result of Ocean’s post, he has lost out on multiple deals in film and music, and is thus seeking $14.5 million in damages from his celebrity son. \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this isn’t the first multi-million defamation suit Cooksey has filed. In 2014, he sued Russell Simmons for $142 million after the producer called him a deadbeat dad on Global Grind . A judge threw that case out with prejudice in September 2016 because it was past the statue of limitations, despite Cooksey claiming he didn’t know about the filing timeframe due to “insanity.” Artists", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:09:05.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
