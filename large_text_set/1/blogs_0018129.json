Focusing that credo with regards to Bollywood, directors and producers put their heart and soul into films so that can put their work out there to as many people as possible. But, once a film is made, the real struggle begins. Apart from post-production, directors and producers are always worried about the censor board. Getting a movie cleared (without being chopped up) is a huge task. Many times the content of the film is objected to, and the movie suffers major cuts or is banned. But not all filmmakers give in under censor board pressure. There are several directors, who stood up for their hard work and fought for their movies. Here are some films that won against the Indian CBFC. Udta Punjab \nThe censor board thought that a movie talking about drugs would demean the state of Punjab, hence they suggested various cuts for the movie. Director Anurag Kahsyap wasn't happy with their decision and appealed to the High Court to look into the matter. On June 13, Bombay HC allowed the screening of the film with just one cut compared to the 13 snips suggested by the CBFC. NH10 \nThis was Anushka Sharma's debut as a producer and honestly, she had a hard time being one. The censor board considered NH10 too harsh for the audience, keeping the cuss words and violence in mind. Initially the board suggested about 30 audio-visual cuts from the movie. Of course, so many cuts would have hampered the whole plot of the movie. Anushka and director Navdeep Singh weren't happy with the board's decision and fought for the film. After several discussions and panels working on the certification, the censor board passed the movie with an â€˜A' certificate (that's restricted to adults only) with just nine cuts. Bombay Velvet \nLooks like Anurag Kahsyap films have a tough time with the censor board. His film Bombay Velvet came under the censor's radar for having abusive language in the film. The committee gave it an \"A\" certificate which didn't go well with Anurag. In an interview, he had said that there was nothing in the film that required the movie to that rating, which certifies that it's restricted to adults only. Anurag went against the board to the revising committee, which later passed the film with a U/A certificate. \nHaraamkhor \nThe movie that talks about a student-teacher love story was definitely going to have trouble being passed by the censor board. Post the trailer's release, the censor board wasted no time in banning the film. The makers were not ready to take a no for an answer went ahead and appealed the Film Certification Apellate Tribunal (FCAT). Soon, a special panel was set to credit the movie and in a landmark judgement the movie was cleared with not only no cuts but with a U/A certificate. That's quite an achievement. 31st October \nStarring actress Soha Ali Khan and Vir Das in lead roles, the movie was based on Indira Gandhi's assassination and the problems faced by the people post the murder. As the movie deals with a controversial topic, 31st October had to struggle to release. After having several cuts, CBFC cleared the film and the movie released on 21st October last year.
