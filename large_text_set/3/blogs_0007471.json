Switch on the gas stove – all four burners – but do not light it. You don’t want to get burns, do you? Then go to sleep.\n‘The magic gas will come to you, you will breathe it while sleeping and in the morning, when you wake up, say “Thank you Alfeya, I’ve become a fairy”. And you will become a real fairy of fire.’\nMore: World Man did have six-tonne porn collection - but he wasn't crushed to death by it \nArmed man robs petrol station while wearing a shark onesie \nFour killed as train ploughs into bus carrying old people's home residents \nPolice have now warned parents about the sickening ‘game’ following complaints from adults in the Vladimir region of Russia.\nState investigator Irina Mirina warned that ‘it could be some kind of suicide game’ – adding that they are now searching for the people behind it.\nHowever the Russian Investigative Committee, the equivalent of the FBI, believes it may really be intended to spark panic among parents.\nPolice are investigating the disturbing ‘game’ (Picture: East2West) One mother said: ‘I woke up in the night and felt a strong smell of gas.
