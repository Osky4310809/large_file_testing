One such example is leading Malayalam actress whose name we have withheld for valid reasons. On February 17th, the actress had a harrowing experience that no woman should ever have to go through, but she did. She was abducted and molested in her own car. Six men hatched this plan, including her driver and drove around molesting her, taking pics of her. The intention was to blackmail her, but little did they who were up against. She filed a complaint despite the disturbing incident she went through. Everyone in the industry was shocked over the industry, but lauded her for her courage. Right from Prithviraj to Dulquer to Mohanlal to Manju Warrier to Nivn Pualy to Dileep – everyone had come togteher to protests against this act. And now 8 days later, the actress is back to work. She is currently part of this project Adam, opposite Prithviraj. We are amazed and in awe of this woman who inspires us, who makes us believe us that there are rockstars out there who never let anything get to them. Prithviraj recently shared her Instagram post where she wrote –“Life has knocked me down a few times. It showed me things I never wanted to see. I experienced sadness and failures. But one thing for sure, I always get up.” We have no words to describe her bravery. She is truly a woman of substance. She has also thanked her fans for all their support.
