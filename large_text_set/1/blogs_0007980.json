According to reports, Trump engaged in a “ golden shower ” — a sex act involving urine, where one or more sexual partners urinates on a person. \nThe leaked documents claimed that Trump hired the presidential suite of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Moscow where President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, had stayed during an official trip to Russia. He paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed that Obamas had previously slept in at the hotel, according to the 35-page document \"prepared for political opponents of Trump by a person who is understood to be a former British intelligence agent,\" Buzzfeed News reported. \nThe incident was allegedly recorded by Russian intelligence officials, who are said to have cameras and audio devices throughout the hotel. \nBefore Trump's alleged \"golden shower\" episode came to light, CNN reported that the president-elect and outgoing President Obama had been told that U.S. officials were aware that Russia allegedly had compromising financial and personal information on Trump. \nThe \"golden shower\" allegation is not the only one in the memos that have been leaked. Another unverified mention of infidelity and prostitutes in the documents BuzzFeed published involved one by a service industry source, who told an alleged former British intelligence agent-turned-private investigator, that when Trump visited St. Petersburg he “participated in sex parties in the city too, but that all direct witnesses to this recently had been ‘silenced’ i.e. bribed or coerced to disappear.” \nNot long after the reports of Trump's alleged scandals made the rounds, \"golden shower\" started trending on social media. Soon it was noticed that Trump’s title of PEOTUS (President Elect of the United States) was quickly changed to PEEOTUS. \nBelow are some of the social media reactions to Trump's \"golden shower\" allegations: Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:43:26.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
