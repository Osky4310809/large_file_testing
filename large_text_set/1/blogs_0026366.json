Share this: By Jason Blevins | | The Denver Post PUBLISHED: January 29, 2017 at 3:39 pm | UPDATED: Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Trump sets 5-year and lifetime lobbying ban for officials \nASPEN — The elusive double backflip — the holy grail of freestyle snowmobiling — spurred carnage once again Sunday at the X Games. \nSnowmobiling pioneers Colten Moore and Heath Frisby were able to flip their 500-pound sleds through two lofty rotations but landing the trick for the first time in competition proved dangerous. Frisby under-rotated and came up short, breaking his snowmobile, which had to be hauled away with a forklift. He was able to walk away but didn’t try a second run. \nMoore, whose brother Caleb suffered a fatal injury at the 2013 Winter X Games, over-rotated his double backflip. After flying higher than any other of the eight athletes in the best trick contest, Colten Moore was bucked off his machine and medics rushed to him as he writhed in the snow at the bottom of the landing ramp. \nAfter several minutes of care, Moore was rushed to the local hospital complaining of back pain, according to event organizers. Related Articles \nFrisby and Moore have spent the past year focused on the biggest trick ever thrown on a snowmobile . \nCaleb Moore died of his injuries after competing on the same course in 2013 when he under-rotated a single backflip and dug the skis of his sled into the lip of the landing. Minutes later, Colten crashed on the same jump, separating his pelvis in an injury that was overshadowed by his brother’s. Caleb died a week later at hospital in Grand Junction. \nFrisby made X Games history in 2012 when he was the first to throw a frontflip on a sled . \nOn Sunday he rolled over his handlebars on the landing, falling off the right side of his sled. \n“I just came up a little short. I should have gone a little further. Sometimes you’re too short and sometimes you’re long,” Frisby said, tearing up as he thanked his sponsors. “We worked our butts off on this project.” \nIt wasn’t the first attempt of the double at the X Games. Levi LaVallee, who won his 11th X Games medal Saturday in the freestyle contest, tried it in 2009. His landing was not pretty back then. After taking bronze Saturday, LaVallee did not compete in best trick Sunday. \nIn 2012, Justin Hoyer was injured trying to do a double backflip in Aspen. Coming up short on the second flip, the front skis on his machine plugged in the landing area. He flew forward and the sled rolled on top of him. Hoyer stumbled to his feet, but then went back to the ground. He suffered a broken left ankle and right forearm. Daniel Bodin does it big! #XGames pic.twitter.com/MwARs2nUx9 \n— X Games (@XGames) January 29, 2017 \nSweden’s Daniel Bodin, who a week ago posted a video of him spinning and landing a double backflip , muffed his first run Sunday. He arrived in Aspen with a tweaked knee and shoulder after landing that double backflip. For his second lap in the best-of-two-runs contest that was last featured in Aspen’s X Games in 2013, Bodin threw a seat-grabbing backflip that earned him his third best trick gold and his fifth X Games medal. \nBrett Turcotte won silver with his second run whip and Joe Parsons, who won his second snowmobile freestyle gold on Saturday, took bronze. \nBodin dedicated his medal to Moore and Frisby. \n“You deserve this one today. What you have done. I know what you guys have been through. This is yours,” he said. “It happens to be around my neck but it’s for you.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:14:55.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
