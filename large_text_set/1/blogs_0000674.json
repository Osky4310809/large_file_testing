Dossier Edit \nJames Vega is tasked to escort Shepard to an Alliance defense committee hearing, but the hearing is interrupted when the Reapers attack Earth . Vega and Ashley Williams / Kaidan Alenko (depending on who survived Virmire ) retrieve the Normandy SR-2 and pick Shepard up from Earth; Anderson convinces Shepard to leave Earth until Shepard can gather allies from the other races. Vega, however, is displeased with this decision and does not wish to leave Earth; unfortunately for him, Shepard overrules him since with their current resources they cannot realistically drive the Reapers away from the Earth at the time. Vega is still displeased but lets the matter drop in favor of professionalism. During a mission on Mars , after Shepard and Ashley/Kaidan reunite with Liara , Shepard sends Vega outside the Mars facility so that Vega can cut Cerberus off if they succeed in escaping with the Prothean data. This turns out to be a wise move; Dr. Eva Coré , revealed to be a Cerberus mole, does indeed manage to get outside the facility with at least part of the Prothean data, but when she attempts to leave by shuttle, Vega crashes his own shuttle into hers, preventing her escape. Eva, further revealed to be a synthetic in the crash, is disabled by Shepard in time, and the Commander orders the squad to take the machine back with them. Vega complies, slinging the robot over his shoulder and dumping it in the medbay outside the AI Core. \nLater on the Citadel , upon noticing how quiet and peaceful the Citadel is, only because the races living here are isolated from the Reaper threat and almost don't believe it's real, Vega finally admits that leaving Earth was the correct decision for Shepard to make. The other races need, in Vega's opinion, a wake-up call, and staying on Earth would not have accomplished such a thing. \nVega normally loiters in the Shuttle Bay by a weapons bench, occasionally bantering with his good friend Steve Cortez over topics of interest. The first time Shepard visits Vega in the Shuttle Bay, James is doing some pull-ups using the overhead bars in his turf. Depending on how far along Shepard is on the track to saving the galaxy, Vega's reactions run the whole gamut. \nImmediately after Shepard debriefs the Council about the Crucible , getting the usual noncommittal and unhelpful responses and being informed they have to rescue a turian primarch from Palaven , James reveals he's never been to the turian homeworld. If he was doing pull-ups by the time Garrus is welcomed aboard, he says he'll take Shepard's word about the turian for it as he can't tell turians apart. If EDI 's got herself a shiny robot body, Vega asks instead if Shepard was \"shitting\" him, and his Commander replies \"I shit you not.\" If Shepard is male, James poses the question if he's just there to inform him about EDI. If Shepard delays talking to him for much farther, James wonders instead what the Commander is doing below decks with the \"grunts\", voicing aloud he was starting to think Shepard doesn't like him. If Shepard really delayed in talking to him, the first thing Vega asks the Commander is if they \"took a wrong turn at the elevator\", by now firmly thinking Shepard didn't know or cared to know where to find him. \nWhatever the circumstances of their first meet, they eventually get into a sparring match, where James gives a brief summary of his activities before joining the Normandy. If Shepard really refrained from talking to him James promises to go easy, \"just in case.\" James narrates that his old CO, Captain Toni , a \"hard-assed son of a bitch\" but a \"good leader\" in Vega's words, was killed along with most of Vega's squad while the squad was protecting a civilian colony from a Collector attack. The leadership vacuum caused by Captain Toni falling in battle was filled in by Vega himself, and he had to make a choice between saving the colony or saving the intel the squad had recovered that could be used to destroy the Collectors. Vega chose to save the intel, but found out far too late that his choice was rendered completely unnecessary since Shepard managed to destroy the Collector threat without the intel Vega saved, which meant that Vega allowed the colony to die for nothing. \nIn the present during the sparring match, Shepard expresses worry that Vega is blaming himself unnecessarily for what happened to the colony, and Shepard believes, based on Vega's reckless stunt with the shuttle back on Mars, that because of his guilt Vega has ceased to care whether he lives or dies. Shepard advises Vega that he needs to get past that incident and stay focused. At the conclusion of the match, Vega thanks Shepard for the pep talk, and one of two scenarios will happen. If Shepard really held off from talking to him, Vega adds \"more hitting, less talking\" next time. If not, James starts nicknaming the Commander: \"Loco\" if male and \"Lola\" if female. Shepard can either allow it or not, and if disallowed, he simply remarks \"[y]our ship. Your rules... your loss.\" \nThe next conversation after the match yields fairly short bits of what Vega is thinking, again influenced by Shepard's progress in saving the galaxy. He talks about chatting up with Garrus hearing he's good with weapons, comments on how distracted he's going to be if EDI and James are taken to the same mission due to her \"super-hot, sexy home\" (\"even more distracted\", he adds if Shepard is female), remarking that krogan males got the pretty gene if Eve is brought aboard, or asks if the krogan and turians are still friends after their recently-cemented alliance. \nIn any event, Shepard can talk to him after that about his family, his state of mind, his friendship with Cortez, his nicknaming of people, and more details about his previous mission. James is unwilling to divulge more about Fehl Prime at that point, though he does provide some details to all other queries. He reveals he's got an uncle , a few cousins, and a father left on Earth when asked about family, though he's unsure if he counts the latter as \"family\". When asked about the nicknames, James just says it's his way of remembering people, claiming that some people don't match their given names. If asked about \"Loco\", James claims he's crazy himself but compared to the shit Shepard's done he looks sane in comparison. If asked about \"Lola\", James claims to be reminded of his best friend's older sister: \"Hot. Tough.\" \nIf Shepard speaks to Vega enough, he invites the Commander to go to the Purgatory Bar on the Citadel for drinks. Upon speaking to Vega in Purgatory, Vega reveals that the lower-ranking soldiers he is having drinks with are slightly intimidated by Shepard, and advises that Shepard buy them all a round of drinks to get them relaxed and consider Shepard to be one of them. Shepard can refuse, prompting Vega to ask Shepard to at least buy Vega a drink. Alternatively, Shepard can agree, and during the round of drinks Vega starts up a variation of an old Scottish toast [3] . The Commander can either finish the toast , prompting the soldiers to become friendly with Shepard, or Vega finishes it, apologizing for thinking the Commander \"knew that one.\" Vega joins Shepard and Liara in retrieving the turian primarch from Menae , where partway through the mission the Normandy's systems start malfunctioning . The three of them push the development to the back of their minds and proceed with the mission if Garrus Vakarian isn't around, or Liara runs back to check on what's happening to be replaced by the turian, whom James meets and works with for the first time. \nAfter the mission, Vega admires Primarch Victus for having \"some real cojones \" and says that the war needs more politicians like him - \"taking names and kicking ass.\" \nOnce the evacuation of Grissom Academy is completed and if Jack was present, Vega speaks appreciatively of her, saying that she is a tough woman, then adds that she is \"hot.\" Vega also comments on the relationship between Anderson and Kahlee Sanders , saying that they make a nice couple. He speaks of his dad having a surname of \"Sanders\", clarifying that he and Kahlee are not related. \nAfter the krogan female's retrieval from Sur'Kesh , if Wrex was present, Vega admires Wrex for his tough guy attitude and is interested in hearing some of the old krogan's stories. If Mordin was also present, Vega finds his habit of speaking very fast quite funny, saying that \"Mordin's mouth moves faster than a frog on a hot rock in the middle of summer.\" If Padok Wiks is present, Vega says that he finds the salarian to be be very strange, even compared to other salarians. \nUpon completing the investigation into rachni on Utukku , James shakes his head in amazement at Shepard's ability to find trouble. If Grunt was present, James quips that he is crazier than Shepard, but Shepard is better looking. \nAfter rescuing a turian platoon from Tuchanka , Vega compares the deserts there with those back on Earth, saying that the lizards and the worms are bigger on Tuchanka. He also remarks that the Primarch's son is in over his head. \nOnce the Cerberus bomb was defused at the cost of Tarquin Victus ' life, Vega sadly states that he would have liked to know Tarquin better. After the mission to cure the genophage , Vega comically asks Shepard if the cure they dispersed could affect them, lest they suddenly start growing scales. He also hopes that they can put aside the diplomacy and go back to fighting the Reapers. \nJames occasionally chats with Cortez while off duty. At one time, he debates with Cortez on the topic: M35 Mako vs M44 Hammerhead . James asserts that the Mako is vastly superior to the Hammerhead, with its powerful cannon and durable armor triumphing over the Hammerhead's inability to take hits. Cortez disagrees, saying the Hammerhead's mobility and maneuverability more than makes up for its low durability. When James says that the Mako doesn't need mobility owing to the presence of a very powerful cannon, Cortez laughs and sarcastically suggests that the M29 Grizzly is more suitable for James. James immediately says that he loves that tank, leading to a snort from Cortez and a remark that only James would like grizzly bears. \nYet another time, James congratulates Cortez for \"loosening up\" a little. When Cortez expresses misgivings over drinking mescal late into the night, James says that it gives one heart which is needed to fight the war. Cortez disagrees, saying it would give him heartburn and moans about not finding decent tequila. James suggests Cortez should be responsible for setting up drinks as a procurement specialist and asks him to set the up. \nAfter stopping Udina's coup on the Citadel , James reveals that he knew Udina was a dirty bastard, but never guessed the Councilor was that rotten. After giving his thoughts on Udina to Shepard, he complains about people not seeing that they have to work together if they are going to win the fight against the Reapers, but Shepard tells him that when people are scared they are slow to trust. James agrees but also states he's adopting a 'shoot first, ask questions later' policy when dealing with politicians. Shepard finds that fair enough. Eventually, Vega asks to speak to Shepard privately. After Shepard invites Vega to the Captain's Cabin using the intercom, Vega explains he has been approached with an offer from the Systems Alliance to undergo N7 training. However, Vega is unsure whether or not to accept the offer since N7 training is a lot of work, and Vega humbly wonders why he was even approached, given his past failure, hence the private conversation. He also confesses that during that mission, his team was betrayed by a colonist who was actually a Cerberus spy working with the Collectors. Vega had no choice but to kill the spy and destroy the Collector ship, which left himself, a civilian , and one other squad member as the sole survivors of the mission. Shepard can either encourage Vega to go for it without hesitation or tell him that a decision such like that is one only he can make. \nJames asks the Commander to refrain from mentioning his current situation to anyone. Shepard accepts, and James thanks them. James announces his intent to go back to the hangar, claiming that things are too soft around Shepard's cabin, though Shepard says the bed is much harder than it looks. If Shepard is female and did not object when he first called her 'Lola', James asks if she's hitting on him, to which Shepard just gives him a look that causes him to back down and depart, but not before thanking her again. Otherwise, James takes Shepard's word for it and thanks them again for the talk. Either way, however, eventually Shepard can meet Vega in the refugee camp getting something tattooed on his shirtless back. Upon being queried, Vega explains that he eventually decided to accept N7 training after all, and is getting a tattoo on his back to celebrate the occasion. Shepard can either congratulate him or admonish him not to take N7 training lightly since it involves huge responsibilities. \nShepard asks Vega if he can return to duty given the pain from the tattoo. Vega responds that it's true that he's not looking forward to putting his armor back on after getting a tattoo on his back but the pain will not prevent him from being part of Shepard's squad. If Shepard's female, James hits on her again but gets flustered when she wonders if he's going to make good on all that flirting. \nOnce the mission to Lesuss is completed, once Cortez expresses his worries for Shepard every time he blows up something, and if Vega was part of the mission, he quips that Cortez should worry about him too. \nAfter the rescue of ex-Cerberus scientists from Gellix , Vega and Garrus are found in the mess, challenging each other to prove their superiority as warriors by relating their previous battles. Vega jokingly retaliates at every one of Garrus's accomplishments, finally saying that he taught a Harvester youngling to let him fly it, at which Garrus dismisses it as a fake and asks if the Alliance actually taught him to make up stuff. James proudly replies that it's a gift. After the the assault on the geth dreadnought , Vega questions Shepard's trust in Legion or the Geth VI . If Legion is the synthetic on board, the Commander can choose either to assure Vega of his trustworthiness or agree with the need to keep an eye on him. Vega agrees that it's not fair to judge an individual by their species; if Tali is present, Vega notes that she worked with a geth despite the history of animosity between their two races. In his opinion, if all the quarians were like her, Shepard wouldn't be stuck refereeing their war with the geth. Vega shakes his head at the quarians' decision to attack the geth in the middle of the Reaper war, saying that the end of life makes everyone a little crazy. \nAfter Shepard's trip to the Geth Consensus , Vega is found in the mess, cooking his abuela 's huevos rancheros . Shepard can ask him about his cooking. If Ashley is on the team, Vega asks Shepard to inform her about the food, remarking that she will need some after the previous night's hangover. \nAfter the mission to rescue Admiral Koris , James contacts Joker on the comm suggesting he use a variant of the quarians' medical exoskeletons to improve his mobility. When Joker complains that it feels like wearing heavy armor which messes with his spatial awareness, James retorts that his own spatial awareness is perfect with heavy armor. If Kaidan is on the team, Vega can be found playing poker with him in the Port Observation Deck after the destruction of the Reaper on Rannoch . If Kaidan is not present on the Normandy, Vega reflects on the quarians' history of warfare with the geth, which took them almost 300 years. He hopes t doesn't take that long to retake Earth. \nIf Shepard sided with the geth over the quarians during their war, James can't believe the geth are fighting on their side and says as much, reminded of the common human idiom \"the devil you know\". Talking with him further, he reflects on how the geth machines took over the quarians' homeworld and never gave it back, hoping the humans' own fight against the Reapers fares better than that. He muses that they just need to get the asari on board so they can finally focus on the Reapers. \nAfter the failed mission on Thessia , Vega tries to cheer Shepard up, saying it wasn't their fault that the mission failed. Vega encourages Shepard to cut themselves some slack because they did all they could. Vega also speaks very appreciatively of the asari, saying that Thessia is one of the wonders of the galaxy, filled with beautiful blue women. \nBefore the final assault on the Citadel beam, Vega can be found a little disquieted at the state of Earth. Shepard assures him everything will be rebuilt and tells him to focus so that he doesn't lose the will to fight. James then salutes the Commander, saying it's been a great honor serving with them. Shepard can choose to shake hands with him and praise him as a good man and a terrific soldier; or the Commander can retort saying that honor won't be worth anything if they lose, to which Vega will agree. \nIf Shepard chooses to activate the Crucible during the battle for Earth , James, along with Joker, Cortez , and any other surviving squad members can be seen paying their respects to Shepard, placing the Commander's name above Anderson's on the memorial wall aboard the Normandy. \nIf the galaxy's forces aren't enough to hold against the Reapers and James is in the squad at the final push towards the Conduit, he will be killed by Harbinger . Mass Effect 3: From Ashes Edit Once Javik has been integrated into the team, Vega reflects on his mental state, saying that it can mess with anybody's mind after being brought forward 50,000 years and being the last of one's kind. Vega hopes that despite all that, Javik will help with the war effort. He also laughs imagining the Illusive Man 's reaction at his failure to secure the Prothean. \nWhile cooking huevos rancheros aboard the Normandy in between missions, Vega attempts to make conversation with Javik, trying to get to know him better. However this proves unsuccessful as Javik doesn't approve of gambling or smoking, something which Vega asks him about. Javik then tells him a joke, which Vega doesn't understand but pretends to and laughs anyway. Javik will snidely comment on how Vega easily believed something that was made up. Mass Effect 3: Leviathan Edit \nWhile gathering forces to strike back against the Reapers, Shepard pursues leads across the galaxy in search of a mythical creature called Leviathan , rumored to have the power to destroy Reapers. As part of the Commander's crew, James assists to a certain degree during this period. \nAfter searching one such lead on the asteroid Mahavid , Vega comments on the people trapped by Leviathan on the asteroid, how they must be feeling coming back into the present. He reflects on how he himself must be feeling if he was one of the ones trapped. \nJames comments on the huge number of harvesters the squad had to encounter while rescuing Ann Bryson , noting that while he doesn't know what the \"scientific measurement of a 'shitload' is\" the number of Harvesters encountered on the planet sure fit the definition. When Cortez expresses distress at not being able to make a proper landing due to overwhelming opposition from the harvesters, James tells him not to let those \"oversized roaches\" push him around. When Cortez suggests that the situation on Namakli was as hopeless as sending James to Earth alone armed with brass knuckles. James asks with a straight face \"What, you don't think I could do it?\" James swings by Dr. Garret Bryson 's lab when Shepard is searching for clues to find Leviathan with Ann. James is deeply sympathetic to her loss and asserts he wants to be there for her, despite having not been invited by Shepard. A rather comical scene unfolds as he becomes interested in the husk head on display, which bites him, much to his bewilderment. He asks EDI if husk bites can turn people into more husks, and she simply recommends that he apply medi-gel. \nWhen Shepard uses the Leviathan artifact in the lab to locate Leviathan, James holds Ann in place as Leviathan takes control of her. James is very opposed to the idea of allowing Leviathan to take over Ann and tries to stop the connection when the control starts to hurt her, though Shepard can order him otherwise. If Ann is incapacitated by the ordeal, James takes her to the medbay. \nLater on the Normandy, after Shepard persuades the Leviathans to take part in the current war, James muses that it was too bad Ann \"never got to see her dad's work pay off\", hinting at Ann's darker fate if she was incapacitated earlier. Otherwise, James just comments on Ann's situation in the positive. He further adds that maybe with the Leviathans onboard there's a chance of actually beating the Reapers. Mass Effect 3: Citadel Edit This article or section is a stub . You can help Mass Effect Wiki by expanding it . James Vega talks to Shepard over comms saying he is coming to assist when the Spectre is being pursued by CAT6 mercenaries. If Urdnot Wrex is not alive, James Vega appears instead and fires a Cobra Missile Launcher at the C-Sec shuttle carrying CAT6 troops, then supports Shepard and their ally as they fend off more CAT6 forces. \nJames sends Shepard an email sometime after the incident requesting face time in the personal apartment . If Shepard invites him over, James initially starts with giving his opinion on the apartment, steering the conversation to romantic relationships and claiming he stopped fraternizing before he joined the military. Vega expresses interest in the Commander's \" personal life \", particularly with potential shipmate paramours, and adjusts his inquiries as much. \nDue to all the flirty banter between a female Shepard and James he says he can't really tell if the Commander is just yanking his chain, and Shepard may reply indicating she's actually interested or confirm she's just keeping him on his toes. If Shepard already has someone else, Vega instead asks if he's getting in the way between Shepard and her current love, and the Commander assures him he's not. \nIf Shepard is in a relationship with either Garrus or Tali , James voices curiosity on the pairing, asking in particular about differences in \"anatomy\". Too awkward a topic, he just withdraws the question, claiming he doesn't really want to know. Vega also approves of a Shepard/ Steve relationship, saying that although he likes to give Esteban a hard time the shuttle pilot is still a great guy who has been through a lot. With Shepard's goading, James finally states his purpose on dropping by: he takes off his shirt to show off his N7 tattoo. Regardless of Shepard's gender or romantic entanglements, James reaffirms his commitment to the mission, and takes his leave claiming Esteban needs his help working on the Normandy's shuttle. \nAs James turns to leave, he discovers the punching bag in the lower bedroom and tells the Commander that they've been holding out on him, proceeding to exercise on the punching bag. Shepard can then interact with the bar between the bedroom and closet, and in doing so, may choose to perform a pull-up. If so, James comments that his record is 182, and challenges the Commander to beat it. If not, James will either ask about a mulligan or else state that he saw Shepard do nothing. \nIf Shepard accepts James's challenge, James comments on his CO's performance at certain landmarks, i.e. 10, 20, 50, 91 (half his record), 100 and around 110 (where he states most people would be happy with 100). If the Commander does beat Vega's record, he admits his amazement, tells Shepard that they still got it, and advises not to let anyone tell them otherwise. Should Shepard fail more than twice to do a significant number of pullups, James will instead marvel at having seen something that Shepard isn't good at. While on shore leave, James also spends his time plying Silversun Strip 's many diversions, like combat-oriented games on Castle Arcade or Armax Arsenal Arena . Shepard may even take him along as a squad member for the latter if the Spectre wishes it. If Shepard is female and in a relationship with Garrus, James turns up in the upper bar of Silver Coast Casino , loitering by the kiosk when two familiar figures start dominating the dance floor. A small crowd gathers watching Shepard and Vakarian do the tango, James among them, and he expresses sly amusement when Shepard swings by in front of him. \nShepard can invite Vega and Cortez for a night of drinks and watching biotiball featuring the Seattle Sorcerers taking on the Usaru Maestros, before or after the party. Cortez sends an e-mail asking for an invitation, if Shepard has helped him reach a sense of closure on his husband's death. \nBoth Cortez and Vega state their cases for each team to win. Vega backs the Maestros and is teased by Cortez for it, who cites Vega's support of the Maestros is mostly due to their players being beautiful asari, than their actual skill. Vega sheepishly admits he has got the \"hots\" for the Maestro players. Shepard is asked to back a team. Selecting a particular team will result in the supporter of that team winning the bet (though the Sorcerers always win the game). Vega is disappointed when his team doesn't win and grudgingly admits defeat. When Shepard questions the nature of the bet, the winner reveals that the bet was only on whether the Commander would be correct in their pick, rather than who would actually win. After the game, both of them thank Shepard and leave the apartment. \nVega is a mandatory invite to Shepard's big party . During the party a female Shepard with no prior commitments can support a hook-up between herself and James. If this happens Shepard will wake up the next morning with James; however, he asks Shepard to not mention what happened to anyone else. \nIn the first stages of the party Vega hangs out with Cortez on the couches in the living room. \nIf Shepard sets a quiet party, James hangs out with Liara by the bar at the poker den, engaging in a debate over which ship is better: the SSV Normandy or the Normandy SR-2 . James favors the latter. \nAt the conclusion of a quiet party, Vega plays poker with Liara in the den. \nIf the party is set to energetic, James spends time at the apartment balcony with Liara and some of the other biotics in the party, namely Liara , Jacob , Jack , Miranda , and Kaidan / Ashley , if they're present. Vega claims physical training trumps biotics, much to the incredulity of the others. Liara challenges this claim and both of them exchange friendly barbs, with the others supporting Liara. Vega then proceeds to show off his \"fine example of peak physical form\". Ashley , if present, shows interest beyond professionalism in Vega, to which he reacts favorably. \nIf Shepard favors physical training, James shows satisfaction at her choice and then points out that he can roll his tongue as well. Later, Liara tells James she's going to challenge him to a pull-up contest, something which causes James to give pause, unsure if he should accept the challenge. If Shepard favors biotics, Vega reluctantly accepts the decision. \nIn the next stage of the party, James demonstrates the result of the debate. If Shepard sided with biotics, Liara gives James a demonstration of her powers by biotically lifting him with seemingly no effort. Vega comments on feeling \"fuzzy\" all over, \"among other things.\" If Shepard chose physical training instead, Vega (plus Jacob and/or Kaidan if they're present) do push-ups. If Kasumi is also around, she sits on top of Vega while cloaked. Vega naturally finds it difficult to keep up with Jacob, much to his consternation. Kasumi finally reveals herself when Vega is tired out and the marine collapses at that instant. \nWhen the party gets wild, Vega flirts heavily with Ashley, if she is present. This flirtation can be encouraged by Shepard or the two can be told to cool off. If encouraged Vega hooks up with Ashley, wooing her with the Spanish phrase \"tu con tantas curvas, y yo sin frenos\" (\"you with such curves, and me with no brakes\"), which Ashley keeps asking him to repeat. \nIf they didn't hook up, James instead dances with the other balcony guests. He favors a fist-pumping moveset akin to aerobic exercise. \nIn the morning after the party, he cooks eggs for the guests, encouraging them all to try his eggs. Trivia Edit According to BioWare, James Vega is intended to reflect the perspective of a new player coming to the franchise. [4] James Vega was originally known as James Sanders, however the name was changed some time after several gaming press outlets visited BioWare and revealed his original name. Vega himself references this after saving Kahlee Sanders from the attack on Grissom Academy , saying his father's last name was Sanders, but has no relation to Kahlee. [5] Like Garrus Vakarian , James also shares the relationship of mentor and protege to a certain extent, following Shepard's advice regarding his military career decisions.
