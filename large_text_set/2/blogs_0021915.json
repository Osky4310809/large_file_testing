Dead Dad .\nShock, yes. Surprise? No: Kroll and Mulaney, friends and creators of The Oh, Hello Show of TV and theater fame, are not polite, to put it as mildly as possible.\nTo put it less mildly, here are some highlights from their scorching monologue and segments:\nOn Mel Gibson \"We like to think of ourselves as the awards show without Mel Gibson,\" Kroll said. \"People wondered how long would it take Hollywood to forgive someone for anti-semitic racist hate speech? The answer? Eight years!\"\nAdded Mulaney: \"So look out for the 2024 Oscars, when the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award goes to Steve Bannon.\"\nSpeaking of, uh, Steve Bannon: \"The only reason he got that job is because he's so hot !\" Kroll cracked. Mulaney: \"Those chapped kneecaps!\" Kroll: \"In this country, if you're that sexy, you can get anything you want. Steve Bannon is so hot. He looks like Nick Offerman drowned.\"\nAnd Bannon's boss, Donald Trump: \"Hey Trump, you and Robert Durst are both rich sociopaths from New York real estate empires, yet somehow, Robert Durst is more likable.\"\nOn the Indie Spirits, and their inevitably dominant winner 'Moonlight' \"This is your day to celebrate each other,\" Mulaney said. \"To stroke each other off. The Spirit Awards are a secret hand-job on the beach. But enough about Moonlight .\"\nAnd finally, that 'Not-in-memoriam' section Kroll: \"So many people died in 2016 that it would be more efficient to show people who haven't died.\"\nThat's when Andy Samberg, dressed poorly as Eddie Vedder, bounded onstage to sing Pearl Jam's \"Alive\" as he honored the living, including Hailee Steinfeld, Tim Allen, \"Mattie D-Bones\" (Matt Damon), Viggo Mortensen, Craig Robinson, Casey Affleck (who was not in his chair, hmmm), and Fred Armisen (who pretended to die at that moment). Samberg took a moment to send off an RIP tweet before attending to the situation.\nNot In Memoriam: @AndySamberg 's tribute to the stars who are still alive. #SpiritAwards pic.twitter.com/KPgI0PLT3E\n‚Äî IFC (@IFC) February 25, 2017\nBONUS: If 'La La Land' was directed by David Lynch, it'd look something like this...", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/IFC/status/835632227631321088", "https://twitter.com/filmindependent/status/835584640152850437", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/6sQtfKsM.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/6sQtfKsM.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpiritAwards?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/AndySamberg", "https://t.co/2pV9pAwJ9t", "https://t.co/KPgI0PLT3E"], "published": "2017-02-26T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:55:52.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
