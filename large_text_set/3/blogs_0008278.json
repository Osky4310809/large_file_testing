We wish Antoine, and his family, great success in the future.” \nThe 32-year-old Bethea signed with the 49ers in 2014 after spending the first eight years of his NFL career with the Colts. He’s been a starter in every season of his career, including starting all 16 games last season. \nBut the new regime in San Francisco wants to get younger, and Bethea was due $5.75 million this season. He has enough left that he can still play in the NFL, but he’ll have to go elsewhere, likely for less money.
