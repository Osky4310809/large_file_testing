The pope supposedly answers \"yes and no\" to the same question — casting doubt over whether he has a clear view on the issue. “ This is the proof that the Pope has enemies …“ \nLast year, four prominent cardinals wrote to Francis requesting clarification on his teachings on family and moral issues. The cardinals took the unusual step of making their request public, as the pope did not reply. \nThe fake news story comes a week after walls around Rome were festooned with illegal posters criticizing some of the pope's recent actions. \nRelated: Mysterious Posters Take Jab at Pope as Conservative Criticism Intensifies \nThe posters showed an image of a stern-looking Francis above the question: \"Eh, Francis, you've commissioned congregations, removed priests, decapitated the Order of Malta and the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate, you've ignored cardinals ... but where's your mercy?\" \nThe posters took issue with Francis' recent actions which affected conservative Catholic groups. Police launched an investigation using closed-circuit cameras into the conservative circles believed responsible, the ANSA news agency said.

Beatrice Larco / AP \nIt is unclear whether the fake news story is being investigated as well. \nThe incidents underscore the tensions between Francis and some conservative elements of the Catholic Church. The pope's calls for a less strict church that is more compassionate toward \"imperfect\" members, such as those who divorced and remarried, has not been welcomed by some conservative members. \n\"Francis is not the first pontiff to fall victim of rumors and fabrications. Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI were all unfairly criticized at some stage. What's new here is the way the rumors are spread. It's a sign of the times,\" Antonio Spadaro, the editor-in-chief of the Jesuit newspaper Civiltà Cattolica, told NBC News. \n\"This is the proof that the pope has enemies and his role as a moral and religious leader is unsettling to some,\" he added. \nA source at the Vatican who spoke on the condition of anonymity, however, downplayed the latest stunt as harmless: \"It wasn't done in bad taste. It's quite funny, actually. We are not worried.\" \nThis is not the first time Francis has been the subject of inaccurate reports. In 2015, the Quotidiano Nazionale newspaper reported, wrongly, that he was diagnosed with a brain tumor right before a much anticipated and debated Synod on the Family.
