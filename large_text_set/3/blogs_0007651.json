In 530i guise, power comes from the B48 2.0 litre turbo four-cylinder, which produces 252 hp at 5,200 rpm and 350 Nm from 1,450 to 4,800 rpm. \nAs with the previous F10, we should also expect the 520d to be offered as well, whereby the 190 hp/400 Nm B47 2.0 litre turbodiesel is carried over from before. A ZF eight-speed automatic will be the transmission fitted on all variants. \nThe G30 has already gone on sale in Thailand , with two CBU imported variants being made available – 520d Luxury and 530i M Sport. The former retails for 3,899,000 baht (RM490,294), while the latter is priced at 4,399,000 baht (RM553,168). \nAlso shown in the ROI site is an upcoming contest that carries the hashtag #MY5UCCESS, which asks Malaysians: “What success is to you?” It also states that participants could stand a chance to win a weekend drive with an “all-new exclusive BMW model.” \nGALLERY: G30 BMW 5 Series Research BMW Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T15:00:08.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
