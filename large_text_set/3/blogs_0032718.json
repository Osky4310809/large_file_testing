The comedian has defended the joke on Twitter, saying he sees ‘offence as the collateral damage of free speech’.\nRyan and Suzi Gourley, who were on their first night out together since the stillbirth of their son Eli in July 2016, left partway through Gervais’ show after hearing his joke and went on to make a complaint about it.\nGourley told Belfast Live she wouldn’t have expected the joke ‘in a million years from anybody’ saying it was ‘just wrong’.\nBut in a series of tweets Gervais defended the fact that he’d caused offence saying he hated the idea that someone might moderate their jokes for fear of causing offence.\nHe wrote: ‘Jokes about “bad things” don’t have to necessarily be pro those bad things. Surely, a joke that’s anti bad things is a good thing, no?\n‘Basically, offence is about feelings, and feelings are personal. People simply don’t like being reminded of bad things.’\nRicky added: ‘All jokes should be banned in case anyone is offended. Discuss.’\nJokes about \"bad things\" don't have to necessarily be pro those bad things.

Wait, I do.\n— Ricky Gervais (@rickygervais) March 30, 2017 \n\nIt has not been revealed what was actually said in the joke and Gervais has told his followers on Twitter that they will have to come to his Humanity tour to find out.\nWhich would be pretty difficult what with all the tour dates being sold out.\nEveryone wanting to know what the 'dead baby' joke is either needs to have a ticket for my sold out tour or wait for it to be on Netflix :)\n— Ricky Gervais (@rickygervais) March 30, 2017 \n\nThe Idiot Abroad creator was not the only one defending the joke.\nSome Twitter users were keen to point out that the aim of Gervais’ joke was to make a joke out of his fear of being a bad parent.\nThe subject of @rickygervais joke was a dead baby – the TARGET of the joke was himself – his fear of being a shit parent. THAT was the joke\n— Stevie Robinson (@johnnyutah66) March 30, 2017 \nthe joke was NOT about dead babies but about Ricky Gervais fear of being a crap parent! Humanity is brilliant! @rickygervais \n— Elisa Cowley (@CowleyElisa) March 30, 2017 \n\nMORE: Ricky Gervais adds even more Humanity tour dates after shows sell out in minutes \nMORE: Ricky Gervais Humanity tickets – when are they on sale and where to get them?
