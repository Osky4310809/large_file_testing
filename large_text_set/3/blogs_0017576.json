Caters News “It’s really rare to operate on a cyst this big, it measured [a foot and a half] in diameter and the circumference was [around 5 feet].”\n“From all the research I’ve found, it’s believed that this is the largest ovarian cyst ever to be removed whole, without draining it first or spilling it.”\n“The largest in history weighed 320 pounds back in 1902, and took several days to drain, I can’t even imagine one that large.”\nViana said the patient was overweight, but after starting on a diet she noticed her arms, legs and face were getting slimmer but her stomach was getting bigger.\nHe said: “When I met her, she could just about walk a couple of steps before getting agitated and feeling like she was struggling to breathe because the cyst was crushing her lungs .”\n“If we hadn’t operated it would have gotten to the point where she wouldn’t have been able to walk, would be severely malnourished and unable to eat.”\n“It’s hard to say how long she would have lived, but it would have been a really bad quality of life.”\n“Two days after surgery she walked out of the hospital.”\n\nCaters News\n\nCaters News\n\nCaters News\n\nCaters News\nEmail Copy Advertisement Woman has 70-pound cyst removed from her ovaries March 20, 2017 “When we saw her six months after surgery to see how the scar was healing and monitor for other problems, she was fully healed.”\n“She was standing completely straight. She now walks like a normal person without needing a walking stick or other mobility aids and her abdomen is now flat.”\nThe patient was referred to Mexico General Hospital as a last resort due to the concerning size of the ovarian cyst and the complicated surgery needed to remove it.\nThe patient after the cyst was removed. Caters News Viana said: “Since the cyst had become so large, it had started to compress her intestines and was preventing her from eating.”\n“She would be full after eating a tiny bit of food and because of the cyst’s size, it was harder for food to pass from the stomach.”\n“The cyst was also compressing the two main vessels in the body, which could have led to serious heart problems.”\nDue to its size, Viana and Dr. Abel Jalife removed the tumor whole because they feared that draining the cyst could put the patient’s life at risk.\nUp to 20 percent of giant ovarian cysts are malignant, meaning that if the cyst was pierced it risked leaking tumorous cells into the patient’s body.\nViana said: “Draining beforehand can be dangerous. If any of the fluid spilled, it risked contaminating the patient’s abdominal wall and spreading tumor cells.”\n“But to remove it whole is also difficult because the cyst wall is less than one millimeter thin and needs to be prevented from drying out, otherwise it could easily break too.”\n“A big part of what we do is the gratification you feel when you could change a person’s life completely, and knowing they would never forget you, even if they forget to say thank you.”\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:52:31.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
