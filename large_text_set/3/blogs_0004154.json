But it’s these sweet and smoky chicken thighs that completely blow Action’s mind. \nIn fact, the dish evokes such strong feelings in Mr. Wonderful that he proclaims Tom to be a “pork and chicken freak” and “mad scientist”—high praise indeed. \nAnd while there is ample sugar in here, chipotle, ginger, star anise, fennel, and coriander seeds cut right through all of that sweetness and make it a one-pot wonder with minimal prep or active time. \nThrow some in the oven, and re-awaken your inner chicken freak from the safety of your home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T08:15:12.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
