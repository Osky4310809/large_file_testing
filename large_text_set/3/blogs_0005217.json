Boston has made 16 selections over the last two drafts, including nine (!) in the first two rounds. Boston University defenseman Charlie McAvoy arguably is the class of that group, and he appears to be ready for NHL competition later this season when the Terriers’ campaign ends, or at the next training camp in the summer. Jeremy Lauzon and Jakub Zboril also could soon compete for a spot soon as defensemen with top-4 potential. \nFirst-round picks Zach Senyshyn and Jake DeBrusk, along with 2014 fifth-round pick Anders Bjork, represent a good amount of skill at forward en route to Boston in the near future. \nThe Bruins are in a good spot. The NHL team is playing well and there are plenty of quality prospects who will compete for roster spots over the next three years. Disrupting that process could have harmed the short- and long-term success of the franchise, and Sweeney made the right call to hold firm. \nThumbnail photo via Greg M.
