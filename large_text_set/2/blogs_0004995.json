The ruthless baddie was brought to life in Daredevil thanks to Vincent D’Onofrio, and the lumbering villain made lift a mess for the residents of Hell’s Kitchen. Other villains have since made their way into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in series like Luke Cage and Jessica Jones - but Kingpin stills reigns supreme with fans. So, really, it’s not too surprising that fans are eager to see the baddie pop up in future projects. \nJust don’t expect to see him in Marvel’s The Punisher . Kingpin won’t be creeping into the series according to D’Onofrio himself. \nNot long ago, the actor took to Twitter to clarify whether the mobster would be part of the upcoming Netflix project. When a fan asked about the possibility of Wilson Fisk returning, D’Onofrio had a rather blunt answer: \n“Nope not a chance. No plans. Zero.” \nOf course, there are fans hoping that the actor is protesting too much to cover up his actual involvement. But, given his interest in the MCU, it seems unlikely that D’Onofrio would bait and switch fans so transparently. \nStill, there is a chance that Kingpin will make a return in other Netflix projects. Last year, D’Onofrio told Collider that he knew the dastardly baddie would make his return. \n“He will, eventually. Honestly, I wish I knew ‘cause I could plan my year better. I know he will come back, I just don’t know when. I can’t wait to find out. I’m totally into the Marvel stuff, big time. I want to do Marvel, all the time. I love it so much ‘cause they’re so creative over there. They let you bring this whole new thing to an iconic thing that they invented. It’s just so much fun. I love it to death,” he said. \nNope not a chance. No plans.
