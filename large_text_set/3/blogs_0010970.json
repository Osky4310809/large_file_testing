AsiaWire Footage of the touching incident was filmed by the coaches themselves as they dived under the waves and approached the trapped whale. The animal had swum too close to shore, tangled itself in the large fishing net and only made matters worse by trying to wriggle free, causing the net to wrap around its head and fins. ‘It was only after we cut away some parts of the net from its body that it finally opened its mouth and I could yank the net out,’ said one of the rescuers. The entire net was successfully removed from the whale’s body and it was free to swim away. However, just as the rescuers expected the animal to leave, they were given a rather touching surprise in response – it stayed. The now viral video of the rescue shows the sperm whale lingering near the boats as if to say thank you, and it even shot some water out of its blowhole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T17:46:43.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
