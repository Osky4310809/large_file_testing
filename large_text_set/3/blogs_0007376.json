The former first-round pick signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday. Warmack, 25, spent his first four NFL seasons with the Tennessee Titans . Selected 10th overall in 2013, Warmack has struggled to live up to his billing. While he has started all 48 of his NFL appearances, Warmack has ranked as a below-average player for most of his career. Pro Football Focus ranked him 62nd among all NFL guards during the 2015 season, after which Warmack ripped former offensive line coach Bob Bostad. “I had one dude who played D-III football at linebacker. And he’s teaching me how to play offensive line? If there’s nothing wrong with that, you tell me,” Warmack told Pete Prisco of CBS Sports. “I play offensive line. I don’t play linebacker. I definitely didn’t play D-III football.\" The Titans allowed Warmack to go into unrestricted free agency after declining his fifth-year option last spring. Things did not go well for Warmack in his contract year, as he was limited to two games after suffering a hand injury and was placed on injured reserve. Signing with the Eagles will be a chance to revive his career, though it's likely Warmack will have to compete for a starting job. His level of play thus far does not merit a guaranteed starting spot, and, while talented, Warmack has missed time each of the last two seasons due to injury. The deal reunites Warmack with former Alabama offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, who currently serves in the same role with the Eagles. Stoutland has been with the Eagles since 2013 and was Warmack's O-line coach in Tuscaloosa in 2011 and 2012. This is a low-risk, potentially high-reward signing if Stoutland can tap into the talent that made Warmack so highly thought of coming out of Alabama.
