I believe as a culture, we take women’s pain less seriously than men’s. \nEven doctors; studies have found that while men wait an average of 49 minutes before being treated for abdominal pain, women will wait for 65 minutes for the same symptoms. \nIn other words, we’re reluctant to complain about things regarding our physical discomfort because we’re used to them being brushed off as over reactions.\nWhich does make me wonder – men, would you put up with a venue that doesn’t let you go to the toilet?\nAdmittedly, some (often old) venues simply haven’t been built by or to accommodate women .\nThis is thanks to something that has a reputation for screwing over women, it’s called The Past. It was a time before women were invited so readily into pubs, clubs and the like, or perhaps it has something to do with architecture being so male-dominated .\nAnd while I can’t ask businesses to magic a new room into an existing building, for those building new designs or those that have enough space to physically fit in more cubicles… well, I don’t think you have a leg to stand on.\nAs with many aspects of public life, toilets are something that has been designed to suit men (a little like when we found out air conditioning guidelines have been created to suit 40-year-old gentleman in the 60s). \nMore Please stop buying 'mum' gifts \nPeople are claiming that Simply Be has stopped representing plus size women \nTarget uses 'real' women to model in #Targetswim \nAnd, like this, as long as women don’t push for change and it continues to be the easiest option for businesses, they’ll continue to build toilets to the basic minimum requirements because, well, that’s the way they’ve always done it. \nSo perhaps it’s time we held businesses’ toilets to the same standard as their drinks, food or whatever it is they’re providing us. \nOr we could just wait for gender segregated toilets to disappear altogether . \nEither way, seriously – hurry up – we’ve gotta pee. \nMORE: What one man learned about sexism from swapping names with his female colleague for a week \nMORE: Man realises sexism exists in work experiment that proves what women already know \nMORE: Ex-Uber employee blows the lid on sexism \nMORE: Primary school introduces gender neutral toilets \nMORE: British Airways flight delayed for five hours over toilet roll ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:00:15.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
