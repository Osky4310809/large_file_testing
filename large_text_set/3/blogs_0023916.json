We will process the case according to the law.” \nWana Oo was charged under a broadly-worded law that forbids defaming people on any telecommunications network and can carry up to three years in jail. \nImages of posts sent to AFP by the police showed several pictures of Tin Tin Hla posted on Wana Oo’s Facebook page with insulting comments underneath. \nDefamation prosecutions have soared since Aung San Suu Kyi’s government took power in March 2016, including for people who have made online criticisms about the democracy leader. \nHopes had been high her NLD party, many of whom spent decades in jail for speaking their minds under Myanmar’s former junta, would usher in a new era of free speech. \nBut social media satirists, activists and journalists have found themselves increasingly targeted under a controversial online defamation law. \nMore than 40 cases have been brought over the past year, compared to just seven between when the legislation was passed in 2013 to when the NLD took power. \nThey include cases against two officials from one of the country’s biggest media groups, a man who called the president ‘crazy’ on Facebook and another who wrote curses about the army on his car. \nA transgender beauty queen was also arrested and then released after being accused of lambasting a famous actress online. \nThe law was originally passed by the previous military-backed government as part of a raft of measures to attract foreign investment into Myanmar’s telecoms sector. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:42:42.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
