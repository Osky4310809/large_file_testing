Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou celebrates winning the Asian Cup Final. Picture Gregg Porteous Source: News Corp Australia \nSources suggest Postecoglou has been targeted by at least one unnamed club in recent weeks, having also been linked with the Greece national team job in the past. \nPostecoglou’s impressive record with the Socceroos has seen his reputation peak, winning the 2015 Asian Cup despite Australia lacking players of star quality. \nSince taking over from Holger Osieck prior to the 2014 World Cup, Postecoglou has created a strong belief within a fresh squad while also promoting an exciting, attacking brand of football. \nThat brand of football saw him have unmatched success in the A-League with Brisbane Roar, who won two Grand Finals under Postecoglou’s tutelage, including going 36 games undefeated.
