Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMorecambe manager Jim Bentley was moved to tears by a kind gesture from the Shrimps fans who decided to pay his FA fine. \nThe 40-year-old, who signed for Morecambe as a defender in 2002 before becoming player-manager and then boss, was sent to the stands against Cheltenham Town on December 17. \nBentley was frustrated when Morecambe's Alex Kenyon was dismissed for his reaction to a challenge by Kyle Storer in the 2-1 defeat. \nHe made his opinion felt and requested a personal hearing, but was instead handed a two-match touchline ban and was hit with a fine.
