None of the cargo spilled, but diesel is leaking from the locomotive, according to Doolittle.\nEmergency services are at the scene cleaning up the mess and fuel, cops said.\nNo cars on Water Street were hit and there do not appear to be any injuries, said Captain Scott Hamill of the Orange County Sheriffâ€™s office.\nIn all, 16 cars plus the engine came off the tracks, said Hamill. The locomotive was pulling a total of 77 freight cars, and 38 of those had cargo, said Doolittle.\nThe incident happened near a fuel storage area, but Hamill said the train did not come in contact with it.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:53:52.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
