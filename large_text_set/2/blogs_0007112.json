He just said, ‘Let’s get married.’” \nBut Kourtney is intent on keeping their relationship platonic and \"told him no\".

(Photo: Instagram/kourtneykardash) \n“Kris [Jenner] is making up for lost time. Production on the show shut down for a while after Kim got robbed in Paris, so she’s really pushing to get some good footage now.” \nThe source continued: “Wake-up call was 6am. The family brought two personal trainers with them, so there was an hour of working out, then two hours of bikini shoots or filming in bikinis, before a liquid breakfast to avoid bloating.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:52:28.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
