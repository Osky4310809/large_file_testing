Leila de Lima’s claim that her arrest was a manifestation of a looming dictatorial rule under the Duterte administration. \nPresidential spokesman Ernesto Abella questioned De Lima’s integrity in asking the people to rally behind her. \n“I would say that her call to keep the spirit of EDSA, of nation-building is worthwhile. However, I doubt if hers is the kind of voice that the people need at this stage,” Abella said. \n“We need people who are true and sincere and not someone who takes advantage of political position for own advancement,” he added. \nAbella criticized De Lima for claiming that her arrest was a result of a political persecution by the Duterte government. \nHe also belied claims that Malacañang was suppressing dissent against the administration.   \n“Dissent is allowed in a democratic situation and that’s what we have. I think Senator De Lima assumed that the criminal cases against her were politically-motivated but it’s not,” Abella said. \nHe noted that protests were allowed by the government following the burial of the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani in Taguig last November. \n“These things of dissent are not being silenced. I think what’s happening is they confused some circumstances in the past with circumstances in the present,” he said. \nThe President is open to the ideas of Cabinet members, according to Abella. \nHe said De Lima should face the charges filed against her instead of putting political color into it. \n“Allies of De Lima must realize that she was charged for a criminal offense and not for political reasons,” Abella said. \nThe Palace official also slammed Rep. Edcel Lagman for comparing Duterte with the former dictator. \nAbella said Duterte is his own person who “draws insights and understanding from various leaders.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T09:39:19.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
