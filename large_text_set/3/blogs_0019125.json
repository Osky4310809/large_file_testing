There will be hurried disc transfers as Rogue One viewings become A New Hope viewings, all in an effort to satisfy whether the gentle retcon actually works. But now, without a ride home from the theater separating the time between watching Vader dice up a bunch of rebel scum and Leia explaining (a little too calmly) that she’s on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan, Paste Magazine found a fan who has definitively answered the question on if R ogue One blends perfectly into A New Hope .\nThe answer: almost perfectly. Rogue One blends almost perfectly into A New Hope .\nThe only issues, for me at least, is the slightly jarring escape, then recapture of Leia’s ship by the Empire, on which Leia is a terrible liar. These were pretty much the same gripes people had back in the carefree days of 2016 when Rogue One came out, and it seems exacerbated now that the footage is lined up all in a tidy little mashup.\nIt’s just hard to get over how relatively calm Vader and Leia’s conversation is in Episode IV :\n\n\n“Don’t act so surprised your highness, you weren’t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.”\nMaybe the dialogue between father and daughter (spoiler alert) could be taken as intentionally snarky now that we know Vader has been following her with the space plans all along, but it still doesn’t add up to a perfect match. \nIt’s close, though. Now we just need an answer to why Obi-Wan ages so poorly .\n(Via Paste Magazine )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:09:22.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
