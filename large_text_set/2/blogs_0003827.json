(Evan Vucci/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   12:31 PM \nWASHINGTON â€” President Trump signed a trio of executive orders he said aimed at cracking down on crime, though the White House didn't immediately release the text of the orders. \n\"I'm signing three executive actions today designed to restore safety in America,\" Trump announced from the Oval Office as he swore in Attorney General Jeff Sessions, saying the first would \"break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth.\" \nThe others, according to Trump, create a task force on reducing violent crime and instruct Sessions to implement a plan to stop crime against law enforcement officers. \n\"A new era of justice begins and it begins right now,\" Trump said. \nThe White House, as has become habit, didn't put out the text of the orders immediately after he signed them. More than an hour after they were put into effect they still weren't public. \nTrump made border issues and crime central parts of his presidential campaign and has made lofty promises about improving border security with a wall and lowering crime rates since he became President. It's as yet unclear what the orders will actually do, though presidential task forces can only make recommendations.
