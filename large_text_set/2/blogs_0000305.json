Image copyright Chelsea Cameron Image caption Ms Cameron was one of a group of students who travelled to Uganda \nShe stopped living with them when she was 14, and instead stayed with various family and friends until she got her own home last October. \nDespite her problems, the teenager excelled at school and discovered a passion for languages. \nShe was one of a group of pupils from Menzieshill High School, Dundee, who travelled to Uganda to carry out charity work. \nAnd last year, as head girl, she spoke in front of hundreds of people at the school's prize giving ceremony. \nNow she has landed an apprenticeship in administration. Life is not sunshine and rainbows and thank you for teaching me that life is unfair, people disappoint you and there's sometimes nothing you can do about that. Chelsea Cameron \nShe told the BBC Scotland news website that a teacher once told her class that anyone who was exposed to drug abuse as a child was \"absolutely certain\" to follow that path. \nFrom that point, she was determined to make a success of her life. \n\"Society wasn't going to tell me what my future was going to be,\" she said. \"Someone else's choices weren't going to determine my future.\" \nHer positive outlook is reflected in the letter to her unemployed parents, in which she thanks them for teaching her to be ambitious. \nShe wrote: \"Your example showed me that no ambition for education, work or any type of success is very harmful and leads to not a lot of self worth. \n\"Your example showed me that life is all about choices and that I didn't need to make the same ones you did.\" Image copyright Chelsea Cameron Image caption Chelsea Cameron was made head girl of Menzieshill High School in Dundee \nThe teenager also reveals that she hid the truth of her family life from her school friends until she was in the third or fourth year of high school. \nShe added: \"Life is not sunshine and rainbows and thank you for teaching me that life is unfair, people disappoint you and there's sometimes nothing you can do about that. A lesson well learnt from the both of you.\" \nShe ends the letter: \"I hope one day that you'll wake up and realise there is so much more the world has to offer you guys and when that day comes, please come to find me so we can enjoy life together. \n\"I'll show you some nice restaurants I like to go to and if you're lucky I might take you to Germany one day. Until then, I'll dream of what my life would be like with parents to enjoy it with.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:00:28.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
