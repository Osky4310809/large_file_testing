Blah blah blah, everyone knows it, we even have an entire show dedicated to the stuff. \nYou know what are also great? Nachos! God, nachos rule. Take a bunch of crunchy, salty chips, top them with melted cheese, throw whatever the hell else you want on there, and watch as each bite becomes its own mini-universe of flavor. Yeah, usually they’re Mexican-ish , but let’s be honest—they sometimes get weird. \nSo naturally, we thought we’d take both and make them into one of the greatest snack food creations ever conceived: pizza nachos. \nThe great thing about this recipe is that it’s super, ultra-customizable. We like to start with a homemade marinara sauce and some Italian sausage and little pepperoni slices cooked in bacon fat, but if you’ve gotta go semi-homemade and use what you have on hand, so be it. \nThe fixin’s you will definitely want to have (if you’re a baller, anyway) are fresh basil, chili flakes, Parmesan, ranch dressing if you’re nastaaaay, and of course, heaps of shredded mozzarella to meld the whole damn thing together. RECIPE: Pizza Nachos \nBut use your own favorite pizza toppings. That’s the real beauty here. \nYeah, we know we’re geniuses. Bring a tray of these to the Super Bowl party, and you’ll be a winner no matter which team scores higher.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T06:41:52.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
