Jose Santa Cruz had been diagnosed with cancer and was not in his corner in New York in July.\nBut Jose was back on Saturday night at the MGM Grand and, as his son predicted, it made all the difference. Santa Cruz fought a gutty fight, and handed Frampton his first career loss with a majority decision victory in front of a raucous crowd of 10,085 at the Grand Garden Arena.\n“He did exactly what we practiced in the gym. He boxed and he countered,” Jose Santa Cruz said. “This is better than anything I could have asked for. I’m so happy that I could be in his corner.”\nThe victorious Santa Cruz said before the fight he wanted revenge. “I wanted to work hard. I went to the gym and I worked hard and I did what I had to do,” he said.\nJudge Burt Clements scored it a draw 114-114. But Dave Moretti and Glenn Feldman both had it 115-113 for Santa Cruz.\nSanta Cruz started out strong, being the aggressor in the first half of the first round. Frampton missed on several wild shots while Santa Cruz used his jab and counterpunching to keep Frampton away.\nBut by the end of the fifth round, it appeared Santa Cruz was tiring, and Frampton was getting inside and landing body shots and quick combinations that took a little steam out of Santa Cruz.\n“We got the belt back,” Santa Cruz said. “I consciously threw less punches than normal. I had to fight smart and I did what I had to do.\n“It felt better with my dad. I always fight for the fans but I also fight for myself.”\nSanta Cruz had told reporters during fight week that he might retire if he lost a second fight to Frampton.\n“Retire? I put retirement in my mind so that I had no choice but to win,” he said. “This is a big win and I gave it my all and did a great job.”\nFrampton offered no excuses. “It was a very tough fight. Some of the rounds were close,” he said. I really think Leo deserved it.\n“He told me what he was going to do. The brawler was out-boxing the boxer. My fault. I’m sorry. We will have to do it again.”\nSanta Cruz (33-1-1, 18 KOs) appeared to tire in the middle rounds and Frampton got inside and starting to connect with combinations that took a little steam off of Santa Cruz’s punches. But he got his second wind in the last four rounds and won several of those rounds on the judges’ scorecards.\nRingstar CEO Richard Schaefer, the fight’s promoter, said he was not surprised, however, by Santa Cruz’s performance.\n“He was the general in there and he took charge and won the battle,” said Schaefer. “He showed discipline but sometimes got carried away. The Mexican in him got the better of him a few times, but it was a Mexican fight, that’s for sure.”\nFrampton (23-1, 14 KOs) had brought several thousand Irish fans to Las Vegas to rally him to victory, and they provided great support for the champion from Belfast. They roard every time Frampton landed a punch. But on this night, Frampton didn’t land enough to take the victory home with him.\nFrampton has said that his next fight will definitely be in Belfast this summer and says that it could be against Lee Selby, the IBF champion whose fight on the Premier Boxing Champions card was canceled after his opponent, Yoni Barros of Argentina, was denied a license to fight in Nevada because of issues with his bloodwork.\nnow it appears that Santa Cruz-Frampton III will happen, if not next, then later in the year.\n(WBA featherweight champion Carl Frampton, left, and Leo Santa Cruz during their weigh-in Friday.
