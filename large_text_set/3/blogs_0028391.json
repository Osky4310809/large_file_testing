Most of these studies were conducted in the U.S. among Christians, but a few were conducted in the Middle East and East Asia on Muslims. This makes it hard to generalize how religiosity in different religions relates to anxiety about death. \nThe study found this pattern to be remarkably consistent no matter how they measured religious belief, including surveying for a belief in God, a belief in the afterlife or just religious behavior like going to church or praying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:13:58.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
