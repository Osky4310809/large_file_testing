The end result is an output of 820 hp and 950 Nm of torque, which is a whopping 240 hp and 200 Nm more than what you’ll get from the already-fast 911 Turbo S. Or to put it simply, you have an avalanche of power at your disposal. \nCuriously, Gemballa didn’t reveal any performance figures of the Avalanche, but it should deliver a marginally faster 0-100 km/h time than a regular 911, and possibly a higher top speed. As a benchmark, the 911 Turbo S does the century sprint in 2.9 seconds with the Sport Chrono pack, and is capable of hitting 330 km/h. \nTo ensure the rest of the car isn’t burdened by the new-found power, Gemballa installed an adjustable sport chassis as well as 21-inch forged wheels wrapped with 255/30 front and 325/25 rear tyres. A more aggressive and wider body, which sees a 62 mm increase in front track width and 100 mm at the rear, is also added to allow room for the larger tyres. \nOther components on the car’s exterior are made from carbon-fibre to keep the things lightweight, and some even provide aerodynamic benefits. We reckon that enormous rear wing is a necessity to keep the car grounded at high speeds. \nGemballa says an “Avalanche would not be an Avalanche without an opulently refined interior,” so two-tone black and white leather upholstery is applied generously around the cabin, together with Alcantara and carbon-fibre accents.
