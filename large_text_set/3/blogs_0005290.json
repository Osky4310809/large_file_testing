Davis Square Donuts and Bagels is slated to open at 377 Summer St., and new owner George Dardonis says it could make its debut sometime in April or May. The original plan came from restaurateur Kyriakos Kouzoukas, who operates Opa Greek Yeeros around the corner from the space that will house Davis Square Donuts and Bagels. Kouzoukas pulled out of the bagel project last summer , speculating that the landlord would re-lease the space, which was previously used for non-food retail. Dardonis told Eater that he reached an agreement with the landlord at 377 Summer St. and will move forward with the concept, which could open in the next couple months. Davis Square Donuts and Bagels has a working website but no details yet about specific menu items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T08:40:43.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
