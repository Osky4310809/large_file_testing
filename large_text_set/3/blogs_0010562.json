Its going to be strange to not see that red mane on the d-line. You were always a class act and a damn good celebrator. 6ball says: Mar 11, 2017 5:05 PM \n. It looks like the Bengals are going to set a record for compensatory picks next year. . nbooat says: Mar 11, 2017 5:16 PM \nAs a life-long Bengal and Peko fan, I can say thank you for all of your effort and leadership! As a football fan, I must say Elway did not do his homework. Peko’s best days are behind him and there is no way he was going to be re-signed by the Bengals. He plays next to Geno Atkins, Carlos Dunlap, and Michael Johnson. He also had Burfict and Dansby behind him. Everyone of his teammates received double teams and I even witnessed teams letting him roam free last year. He did nothing and can be credited for all of their def struggles. It was like 11 players on 10. He played like an elephant wearing rollerskates on ice. I’m not hear to bad mouth one of my favorite players, but just state the facts. I also want to congratulate him on his $4 mil severance package when he gets cut. I’m happy he fleeced the arrogant Broncos! whodey420 says: Mar 11, 2017 5:18 PM \nHe should have been gone 2-3 years ago. I get sick of seeing him dragged 5 yards passed the LOS by 2nd and 3rd string RB’s all the time. Mar 11, 2017 5:21 PM \nGood luck Peko! This Guy is a class act!
