It’s the culture, what they believe in, letting off steam like that. I don’t know if they look at the science behind it.”\nAs far as the fighting, Chin said he initially thought it was “barbaric,” but he came to understand it in his time with the Canucks.\n“I picked a lot of brains, asked a lot of lads what was the fighting about,” he said. “What fascinated me was the player power, the whole running that allows players to throw off the gloves and fight. I thought at first this was so barbaric, allowed to go on in sport, it’s crazy like.\n“The players were able to explain, and I was so intrigued by it and the reasoning behinds it. Literally, it’s the players that police that ruling, and there’s nothing in the rule book to say you can’t do it. It’s there for the players to protect them. If a guy is acting the maggot with another player on the ice, he has to pay for it, and that’s the way it’s done.”\nChin swapped places with former Canucks goalie Alex Auld, who spent a week with Chin’s hurling club in Wexford, Ireland. For Chin’s sake, let’s hope the drinking-and-fighting ethos of the NHL didn’t rub off on the Wexford squad.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:26:16.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
