As previously announced by CEO Elon Musk, Tesla vehicles fitted with the full self-driving hardware suite will be soon able to offer up to Level 5 autonomy via gradual software updates. \nAutopilot 8.1 is just one of those, bringing with it a higher Autosteer speed limit (89 km/ to 129 km/h). However, the carmaker requires that the cameras be calibrated prior to using Autosteer at higher speeds, which is done automatically over several days of driving on well-marked highways. \nAnother introduction here is Auto Lane Change, a feature that was already available on Teslas fitted with first-gen Autopilot hardware. The update also includes Summon, a beta feature that works in conjunction with Autopark, whereby the car can be ordered to enter or exit a tight parking garage for instance.
