Interestingly, the firm believes that the OLED iPhone will make up for a majority of the shipments despite it being rumored to cost upwards of $1000. \nCiting supply chain sources, the report reaffirms that one of the three new iPhone models launching from Apple this year will sport a 5.8-inch OLED display with 2K resolution. Contrary to the rumors, though, the handset will not use a curved AMOLED panel due to reliability issues of the panel and the 3D cover glass in its drop tests. Instead, Apple will continue using a 2.5D curved glass on the device like it has on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. \nThe top-of-the-line OLED iPhone 8 will also do away with the physical home button, with Apple integrating the Touch ID sensor into the display. By removing the home button, Apple will be able to make the device more compact than usual with an aspect ratio exceeding 2:1. The report states that the phone’s “overall body size could be similar to that of the next 4.7-inch model,” though that does seem unlikely to me. The handset will also come with 3GB RAM and will be available in 64GB/256GB storage variants. \nLastly, the report states that Apple will use the premium 5.8-inch OLED iPhone to debut new 3D sensing and facial recognition technology. The new technology will also be used for augmented reality features that the handset will debut with. \nAs for the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 variants, they will continue to feature LCD displays. The 5.5-inch model is expected to feature 3GB RAM, with the smaller variant coming with 2GB RAM. Both models will be available with 256GB storage. \nIn terms of pricing, Apple will be pricing the three models differently to cater to a wider range of consumers. The 4.7-inch iPhone will be the cheapest of the bunch, with the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 being the costliest of the bunch. \nInterestingly, Apple launching an OLED iPhone could have an adverse effect on the growth of Chinese OEMs like Oppo and Huawei due to the shortage of OLED panels. \nMost of the claims that TrendForce has made in their report today have already been heard previously . With so many rumors and supply chain sources based reports, it is certain that Apple will indeed be launching three new iPhone variants this year, with one of them making use of an OLED panel. \nWill you upgrade to the top-of-the-line iPhone 8 if it comes with all the features mentioned in the report?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:54:20.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
