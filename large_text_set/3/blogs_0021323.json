For nearly 500 years, classrooms have referred to the Mercator projection, which exaggerated the size of continents in the northern hemisphere. But now Boston public schools are switching over to the Gall-Peters projection, which attempts to correct the sizes of countries and could have a dramatic impact on students' worldview.\n\n\nThe Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator devised the Mercator projection all the way back in 1569. Now hundreds of years later, Boston schools are implementing a replacement, and director of the Boston public schools history department Natacha Scott says they believe they are the first public school district in America to make the switch.\nRelated: New map reveals the world's most toxic countries \n\nThe Mercator projection has informed our collective worldview for centuries, but Mercator made it seem as if North America and Europe were larger than South America and Africa , for example. He also moved the equator, which places Germany near the map's middle instead of much further north. Arno Peters, a German historian, released his projection in 1974 - as it corresponds with work by James Gall, a 19th century Scottish cartographer; today it's called the Peters or Gall-Peters projection.\nNow in Boston classrooms, teachers have put the Gall-Peters projection up next to the Mercator projection. Colin Rose, Assistant Superintendent of Opportunity and Achievement Gaps for the Boston Public Schools, told The Guardian, \"This is the start of a three-year effort to decolonize the curriculum in our public schools...It's important that students trust the material they are given in school but also question it. The Mercator projection is a symbolic representation that put Europe at the center of the world. And when you continue to show images of the places where people's heritage is rooted that is not accurate, that has an effect on students.\" \nBut some people say the Gall-Peters projection is also distorted - stemming mainly from the fact that it's difficult to place a three dimensional sphere shape on a two dimensional piece of paper. Sizes are correct in the Gall-Peters projection, but shapes are wrong: near the poles countries are stretched horizontally and near the equator they're stretched vertically, according to Business Insider, which pointed to four alternatives , including the Winkel tripel projection which National Geographic adopted in 1998.\nVia The Guardian and Business Insider \nImages via Wikimedia Commons ( 1 , 2 ) \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:09:05.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
