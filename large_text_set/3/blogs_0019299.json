While the core WordPress software is free, the cost of a WordPress site depends entirely on your budget and goals. In this article, we will break it all down to answer the ultimate question: How much does it really cost to build a WordPress website? We’ll also show you how to avoid overspending and minimize cost when building a website. \n\nWhat Do You Need to Build a WordPress Website? WordPress is free for anyone to download and use. It is an open source software which gives you freedom to install it on any kind of website. \nSo if WordPress is free, then where is the cost coming from? \nThe cost of a WordPress site can be broken down into following categories: \nWordPress hosting Domain Name Design Plugins and Extensions (Apps) To create a self hosted WordPress site, you need web hosting to store your files. Every website on the internet needs hosting. This is your website’s home on the internet. \nNext, you will need a domain name . This will be your website’s address on the internet, and this is what your users will type in the browser to reach your website (example, wpbeginner.com or google.com). \nWith WordPress, there are tons of free website templates available that you can use. However if you want something more advanced / custom, then you can purchase a premium template or have one custom made which will raise the cost.\nThere are 40,000+ free plugins for WordPress. These are apps and extensions for your websites. Think features like contact form, gallery, etc.\nSo while you can build a website with just the hosting and domain cost, based on your situation, you may end up paying for additional tools and services. That’s why it’s often confusing for people to find out the real cost of a WordPress website.\nLet us walk you through the real cost of building a WordPress site.\nEstimating The Real Cost of Building a WordPress Site \nDepending on your needs, your cost to start a WordPress website can range from $100 to $500 to $3000, to even as high as $30,000 or more.\nIt’s important to know what type of website you are building, and what you’ll need for it because that will directly affect your cost.\nBut don’t worry, we’ll show you how to avoid a financial disaster and make the best decisions.\nFor the sake of this article, let’s break down websites into different budget categories: \nBuilding a WordPress website (low budget) Building a WordPress website (with more features) Building a WordPress eCommerce website Building a custom WordPress website Now let’s see how much each of these projects cost and how you can avoid spending any more than necessary. \nWhat’s the Cost of a WordPress Website (Low Budget)? \nYou can build a fully functional WordPress website for yourself and keep your costs under $100.

SSL is required to securely transfer customer data such as credit card information, usernames, passwords, etc.\nWe recommend using Bluehost Ecommerce plan. It gives you a free domain and SSL certificate , plus discount on hosting. \nAfter that, you need to select a WordPress eCommerce plugin.\nThere are several eCommerce plugins for WordPress , but none comes even close to WooCommerce . It is the most popular WordPress eCommerce plugin that allows you to build robust online stores to sell your products/services.\nNext, you will need to install WordPress and WooCommerce on your website.

It could be higher depending on how many paid addons and services you add to your site. \nWhat’s the Cost of a Custom WordPress Site? \nA custom WordPress site is when you hire a WordPress developer to create a unique design and build specific features for it. \nUsually well established, large to medium sized businesses choose this route. \nTo support a custom WordPress site, you may also want to go for a managed WordPress hosting provider. This is WordPress centric hosting environment, with managed updates, premium support, strict security, and developer friendly tools. \nIn addition to your hosting and domain name, you will also be paying the developer that’s building your website. \nThe cost of a custom website depends on your requirements, budget, and the rates of the developer or agency you hire. \nA standard custom WordPress theme alone can cost you upto $5000. More robust WordPress sites with specific custom features can cost up to $15000 or even higher. \nHow to Avoid Overpaying and Cut Down Spending? We always recommend our users to start small and then scale their WordPress site as it grows. In many cases you don’t need all the premium features that you see on many well established websites in your industry. \nKeep in mind that those websites had a head start, and it likely took them time to figure out how to manage costs and grow their business. \nYou can start with a budget website using free plugins and template. Once you start getting visitors, you can consider adding premium features like a premium template, email marketing, paid backup plugin, website firewall and so on. \nSame goes for your eCommerce website. Start with bare minimum and then as you start selling, you will find out exactly the tools that will help you and your customers. \nLook for best WordPress deals and coupons to get additional discounts whenever you can. \nEven for robust WordPress sites you don’t always need to hire a developer.
