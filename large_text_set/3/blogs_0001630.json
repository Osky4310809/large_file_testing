Photo: Apple \nMarch 3, 1975: The Homebrew Computer Club, a hobbyist group that helps spark the personal computing revolution, holds it first meeting in Menlo Park, California. \nA forum for computer geeks at a time when few others cared, regular attendee Steve Wozniak and his friend Steve Jobs will eventually show off the first Apple-1 unit at the club. Homebrew Computer Club history \nThe first Homebrew Computer Club meeting was held in the garage of founders Fred Moore and Gordon French. At the time, the arrival of a kit computer called the Altair 8800 was the hot news in the tech world. The Altair kick-started the boom in personal computers and inspired a generation of techies. \nWozniak, who was far more of a prototypical computer geek than Jobs (and I say that in the nicest possible way!), was the Apple co-founder most involved with Homebrew. He attended the very first meeting, and has spoken about how it inspired him to build his own computer. \n“I did this computer … to show the people at Homebrew that it was possible to build a very affordable computer — a real computer you could program for the price of the Altair — with just a few chips,” Wozniak recalled in his autobiography . Apple and the Homebrew Computer Club \nOriginally, Woz’s plan was to design the Apple-1 blueprints, then give them away to other Homebrew members to build themselves. “This was my way of socializing and getting recognized,” Woz wrote. “I had to build something to show other people.” \nIn the end, Jobs convinced Woz that they would be better off building and selling the Apple-1 rather than giving away the designs. This ultimately led to Jobs negotiating a deal with early computer store The Byte Shop . The rest is history. \nAs for the Homebrew Computer Club, it ran for the best part of three years, moving from the garage to the larger Stanford Linear Accelerator Center . The club come to an end in 1977, the same year Apple officially incorporated .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T21:12:41.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
