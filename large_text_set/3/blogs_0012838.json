Following Rozay's incendiary diss track, \" Idols Become Rivals ,\" Twitter users are now speculating that DJ Khaled 's symbolic \"they\" was actually the Cash Money CEO. \nOn his Birdman diss track, Ross accuses Stunna of doing DJ Khaled dirty, failing to pay him and many other producers. For years, Khaled has spoken about \"they,\" nefarious haters intent on stopping the progress of his crew and associates. Until \"Idols Become Rivals,\" everyone thought the Miami hitmaker meant fake friends, personal enemies, bad relatives or simply \"the Man.\" \n\"BACK IN THE DAY I USED TO JUST CALL \"THEY\" HATERS, BUT I REALIZED AFTER A WHILE THAT I HAD TO CHANGE THAT WORD OUT OF NECESSITY. \"THEY\" ARE SNEAKIER THAN THAT—“THEY” TAKE ALL FORMS. FOR SOME IT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT THAT THERE’S HATE IN THEIR HEARTS, BUT OTHERS HAVE A DISGUISE,\" Khaled wrote in his book The Keys . \nRead the Twitter theory that launched a new, less generalized meaning to the word \"they.\" So when Khaled refers to \"They\" he's talking about Birdman, Baby, and Stunna???? — Charlamagne Tha God (@cthagod) March 17, 2017 When Rick Ross discloses who Dj Khaled is referring to as \"they\" and it's been Birdman this whole time pic.twitter.com/uOwlsB0skU", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:13:56.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
