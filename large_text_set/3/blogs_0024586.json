Furthermore, I absolutely don’t know their relationship statuses. \nActually, one of them has pretty loud sex every once in a while, so I’m thinking he has a girlfriend. But honestly, I have no idea. \nIf I found out one of them broke up with their girlfriend, however, my only reaction would be that I was 1) surprised they girlfriend in the first place and 2) surprised they’re sharing this info with me in the first place. \nClearly, I am a far worse person than one guy who noticed his neighbor’s girlfriend moving out of their apartment the other day because instead of doing literally nothing about it (like I would have done), this neighbor left him a note AND MONEY. 5 Stages Every Girl Goes Through After A Breakup [5TAGES] To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nThe note read, \nHEY DUDE- \nI SAW YOU MOVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND OUT YESTERDAY. SORRY ABOUT THAT MAN. THERE ARE DEFINITELY OTHER FISH IN THE SEA..! TAKE THIS & BREAK IT INTO ONES AND GET YOUR ASS TO THE STRIP CLUB!! \nCHEER UP NEIGHBOR, \nMERRY X-MAS, \nAPT. 3F \n(Sorry for the all caps.

Maybe the neighbor works at the strip club and only wants him there because he has a crush. Imgur Maybe the ex works at the strip club, and that’s why he hasn’t gone yet. Imgur Maybe she was moving in with the neighbor, and he feels guilty. Imgur Maybe the ex was boinking the “nice” neighbor. Imgur \nTo all of that, I say BYE to the haters. I choose to believe this guy really WAS just being a nice bro and helping his neighbor out.
