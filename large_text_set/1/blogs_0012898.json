Scarlett Moffatt snapped outside the BBC Studios on Saturday (Photo: Rex Features) \nSqueezing herself into a pair of sexy leather trousers, the brunette beauty, 26, looked fantastic as she cliutched a take-away coffee in one hand and a designer handbag in the other. \nBeaming a broad smile as she greeted onlookers, the jungle queen - who won I'm A Celeb in December - appeared to be on fine form. \nThis is despite the fact fans have been pleading with her not to lose any more blubber after posting a skinny snap of herself on Instagram, Wednesday. \nThe Geordie lass was inundated with messages from concerned fans who feel she's at risk of surpassing her ideal body mass.

Scarlett proves that less is more - although some fans disagree (Photo: Instagram) \n\"It was hard for me, going home and explaining to my mum and dad why I went to the doctors and what was wrong with me,\" she said. \n\"They also tested my for diabetes type 2 because they said I could be pre-diabetic, and I was like 'Oh my gosh, I’m 25, I don’t understand how I’ve got to this’...\" \nBut it wasn't an easy journey. In a sneak preview from the DVD, the star can be seen at the start of her journey getting weighed. \nWhen she finds out she weighs 11 stone 5lbs, she bursts into tears. \"I would just say to anyone starting out [losing weight and getting healthy], just focus on the positives,\" Scarlett added.
