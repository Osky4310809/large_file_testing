To celebrate, the brand rounded up a group of top makeup artists and challenged them to dream up looks using the new matte hues. \"How do you Highline?\" is the name of the stunning social media campaign, and when we say they rounded up top makeup artists to participate, we mean it. There's backstage and editorial superstars like Dick Page and Diane Kendal , celebrity favorites such as Sarah Tanno , Hung Vanngo , and Vincent Oquendo , as well as several of Marc Jacobs Beauty's own global makeup artists. And the makeup looks they've created are incredibly inspiring — multicolored smoky eyes a la Blondie in the '80s, artful shapes and spontaneous squiggles, and the sharpest cat eyes you've ever seen (or could hope to achieve). We rounded up our favorites, and got exclusive details on straight from the artists themselves. March 29, 2017 Diane Kendal \"For the first look on Mayowa, I was really inspired by Nina Simone,\" says Kendal. After outlining the eyes with the Highliner Gel Eye Crayon in Blacquer , she drew the outline of a wing in red with the Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon in Fine(wine) . Diane Kendal Kendal used the Highliner Matte in Out of the Blue to create this unique shape. To add some contrast, she coated the lashes in a burgundy-colored mascara. \"It looks amazing against the bright blue,\" she says. Diane Kendal Kendal looked to the makeup and colors of ' 80s new wave for this major, multifaceted eye. She also used a whopping total of five different shades. To start, she laid down a base of the Highliner Matte in (Grape)vine, tracing the top and bottom lashes, outlining the shape, and then blending the color while leaving the center of the lids bare. She layered Out of the Blue on the inner and outer corners to bump up the brightness, and added a mix of the shades Mist Me? (lilac) and (Pop)ular (hot pink) on that blank space in the middle of the lids. Finally, she traced the waterlines with Whirl(pool), a creamy, almost electric teal color. Dick Page \"For this look, I was thinking of a scene from Tony Kushner's play 'Angels in America,' where the characters Prior Walter and Harper Pitt meet in a dream sequence ,\" says Page of the inspiration behind the this look he created on model Vincent Beier. \"Prior has been trying to cheer himself up by 'applying the face,' so I gave Vincent a kind of 'rock and roll drag' look, with a sharply lined/contoured eye in black, blues, and silver.\" Page traced the lashes and waterlines with the Highliner Gel Eye Crayon in Blacquer, drew on exaggerated cat eyes with a liquid liner, and buffed out the black liner with a mix of the Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayons in Out of the Blue, Deja Blue, (Iron), and a pearly white shimmer. Dick Page Dick Page Page buffed and blended the Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayons in Fine(wine), Out of the Blue, and (Iron)y until they had a hazy, watercolor-like effect on the lids. Vincent Oquendo Oquendo took a makeup look we're used to seeing — graphic wings — and tried it in an unexpected pale hue: the Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayon in Pink of Me, a very pastel pink. \"I chose the pale pink liner because it felt whimsical and feminine, but still a bit tough and punk-y,\" he says. Vincent Oquendo Gilbert Soliz Soliz used the Highliner Gel Eye Crayon in Fine(wine) almost like an eye shadow, scribbling the pencil onto the lids, then buffing it up to the brows with a medium-sized synthetic brush. He then traced the bottom lashes with a mix of two pencils — black and purple — and used a tiny smudger brush to smoke out the pigment. \"You have about 15 seconds to play around with the Highliners before they set,\" he says. Gilbert Soliz For this look, Soliz combined blocks of teal (Whir(pool)) and cobalt blue (Out of the Blue). Marygene Rose Rose thought out of the (pencil) box when she used the Highliner Matte in Mist Me and the brand's Fineliner Ultra-Skinny Gel Eye Crayon in (Big)Eyes! to scatter circles around the model's eyes and brows. Marygene Rose Burgundy underliner (the Highliner Matte in Fine(wine)) and floating wings make for a subversively sexy vibe. Hung Vanngo \"This is a monochromatic look but with an unexpected pop of green on the lids to keep it interesting,\" says Vanngo. Using the Highliner Matte in (Brown)ie, Vanngo traced the lashes and crafted a rounded wing shape, leaving the inner corners blank where he added the bright teal (the Highliner Matte in Whirl(pool). Hung Vanngo Sarah Tanno Now we only ever want to wear red lipstick with teal eyeliner. The model is wearing (and holding) the Highliner Matte in Whirl(pool). Sarah Tanno Yvonne Macinnis Macinnis lined the eyes (with the Highliner Matte in Mist Me? — and the cheeks (that would be the Highliner Matte in (Brown)ie). Michael Ashton Black winged liner so sharp it could cut ice. Michael Ashton \"This is my take on old school Cindy Crawford/'80s Grace Jones,\" says Ashton, who buffed a mix of the Highliner Matte Gel Eye Crayons in Fine(wine) and Brownie all around the eyes. \"Estelle has beautiful green eyes and the burgundy really helps enhance them.\" Jeffrey English We call this \"Blondie meets Jem and the Holograms.\" English used the Highliner Matte in Whir(pool), Out of the Blue, (Pop)ular, and a bit of (Iron)y. # Keywords # Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:38:18.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
