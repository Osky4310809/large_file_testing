Miss Universe 2015, the Philippines' own Pia Wurtzbach, ended her reign and passed on the crown to Miss France Iris Mittenaere. Miss Haiti Raquel Pelissier was first runner-up, while Miss Colombia Andrea Tovar was second runner-up. As always, the pageant was a roller coaster of emotions – happiness, excitement, sadness, disappointment, and even anger filled social media as netizens watched the pageant unfold. Check out the highlights on social media below. Funny intros The #MissUniverse hashtag trended immediately, getting hundreds of thousands of tweets even before the show started. As usual, Filipinos found a way to inject humor into their social media posts. The hashtag #RhymingIntroForMissU trended in the Philippines as people suggested funny ways for candidates to introduce themselves. #RhymingIntroForMissU Netizens were also keen on making their favorite candidates trend, and some of these candidates trended worldwide. Among them was Miss Thailand Chalita Suansane, the winner of the fan vote, who was clearly very popular based on the tweets about her. The same goes for Brazil's Raissa Santana, who was also trending throughout the pageant. And, of course, Filipinos showed all-out support for their bet, Maxine Medina. Go Maxine Maxine's answer Maxine's answer during the Q&A portion, however, drew some negative reactions. She had opted to answer in English instead of relying on her interpreter – a topic of debate in recent weeks leading up to the pageant. Some believe her answer ultimately hurt her chances of advancing to the Top 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T10:56:14.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
