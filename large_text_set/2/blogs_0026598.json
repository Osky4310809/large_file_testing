This means that during March, we become aware of communication. It’s an opportunity to pay attention to how we communicate outwardly, and watch how other people are expressing themselves to us . \nA lot of the communication style we have been seeing lately has not been pretty. We can learn a lot by attuning ourselves to the vibrational energy of people’s interactions with us, and how their communication style affects us. \nWhen we do this, we notice every nuance in their tone of voice, every word of judgment and also how aggressive their body language or approach feels. We will also notice the unhealthy and destructive communication style of those who use the silent treatment or passive aggression to make a point. These kinds of behavior are energy draining and sabotage relationships. \nOn the opposite end of the scale, we will pay far greater attention to those who express themselves with love, care, compassion, empathy, consideration, and sensitivity. \nOnce we have determined which communication dynamics are being used, we can observe how we are reacting and responding to those with who we engage. \nThe energy of three also signifies self-improvement and healing, so we will be learning valuable communication lessons about how we can improve the way we talk, listen and respond. Instead of reacting instantly, we will take a moment to consider why this person is speaking or writing to us in a certain way. \nOur empathy will spike, and we will find ourselves tuning into the other person’s energy, so we can attempt to see things from their perspective, rather than solely our own. \nWhen we understand their communication style more clearly, we can discern whether it is just a temporary issue—due to currently significant difficulties of our own, or something that’s amiss in the other person’s life—or whether it is longterm dysfunction that we may decide not to be a part of. \nOverall, despite the awareness of problematic modes of expression, March will bring transformational healing for us and our relationships. As we learn to express ourselves in a more respectful, compassionate and considerate manner, we will also learn the power of responding more thoughtfully to those who communicate with us harshly, rather than giving a highly-charged emotional and instant reaction. \nFor relationships that already use loving communication, we will notice a higher level of love, warmth, and appreciation, which translates to stronger and more meaningful bonds, within friendships and romantic partnerships. \nEvery number has a unique vibration and personality, giving it a certain set of characteristics with both strengths and weaknesses. \nMany people regularly see the number 3 in a variety of forms, whether it’s 3, 33, 333, or 3333. The reason for this, is unique to each individual. While there is a general explanation for a certain number appearing, only the person who frequently sees the number will be able to work out the personal meaning. . \nGuidance comes in numerous forms, and often it arrives in the most unexpected ways, so it can take time to understand the meaning. \nMany of us may notice that numbers regularly appear in certain sequences on clocks, phones, registration plates, checks, or receipts. This is simply the universe’s way of communicating through signs and synchronicity .

It is a gentle nudge to encourage a little more balance between Earth and spirit. \nThe meaning of 33. \nThe number 33 is an expansion of the number 3, so it holds the same characteristics, however they are dramatically enhanced. \nThose who frequently see this number are humanitarians who have a soul purpose to leave the world a better place than when they arrived.

It is also a reminder not to be concerned about obstacles or challenges that appear along the way. \nThe spiritual road is not always easy and the more we advance along it, the greater the lessons we receive. The 3333 sequence is a powerful reminder that everything happens for a divine reason, so do not be dismayed or disillusioned if certain things do not turn out as we hoped. \n3333 is a number that arrives when we need to place our full trust in the universe and have fait h that not everything we wish for is for our higher good. Sometimes, not getting the very thing we want is an immense blessing. \n3333 asks us not to worry, as the universe is conspiring in our favor, so all we need to do is to keep moving onward and upward with patience, because soul missions and higher purposes materialize with divine timing, and not a moment sooner. \nThe universe presents the number 3333 as a sign of guidance, so that we do not waver on our path. Instead we raise our vibration, by remaining positive and trusting, so that we are ready to receive the next stage of our life when it is ready for us. \n3333 is a cosmic message that translates to, “Trust that everything is in order, don’t look back, and keep moving forward.” \nWhen certain numbers spontaneously appear, it is not a coincidence. There is great benefit to paying attention to the meaning that they have in our lives. \nThe universe works in mysterious ways, and everything within it carries an energetic vibration. When our vibration matches that of the universe, we can feel assured that we are safe and protected. We are being shown subtle signs that prove miracles can happen. \n~", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:32:40.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
