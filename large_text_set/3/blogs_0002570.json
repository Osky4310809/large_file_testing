Photograph: Steve Bloom Images/Alamy Supported by   14.12 GMT Last modified on   14.13 GMT \nDavid Attenborough and Steve Backshall have joined conservationists and charities asking the Borneo government to reconsider a bridge that threatens one of the last sanctuaries of the rare pygmy elephant. \nThere are now just 1,500 of the world’s smallest pachyderm, according to WWF, and about 300 of them make their home in the 26,000-hectare Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, in the state of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. But construction teams have begun preparatory work for a bridge that will cross the Kinabatangan river which weaves through the region. The area is also home to critically endangered orangutans, proboscis monkeys, clouded leopards, gibbons, sun bears, pangolins and thousands of other jungle species, and hosts a thriving eco-tourism industry where travellers can view wildlife from boats on the river or while hiking into the forests. \nAttenborough, known globally for his wildlife documentaries and conservation work, rarely intervenes in domestic planning issues. But he has written to the chief minister of the region, arguing that the plan will harm already embattled wildlife populations and create a new barrier for migrating Bornean elephants. Listed as endangered by the IUCN, they require large areas of habitat for foraging and many fear that the increasingly fragmented populations will lead to genetic problems. \n“I have had many encounters with the magnificent and unique species with which your state is blessed,” Attenborough wrote. “If this construction is allowed to go ahead, I am left in no doubt that the bridge will have significant negative effects on the region’s wildlife, the Kinabatangan’s thriving tourism industry and on the image of Sabah as a whole.” \nSabah and the Kinabatangan rainforest have been transformed over the past few decades. Palm oil plantations have fractured much of the habitat, forcing species into ever-smaller pockets of forest. Already, the Bornean rhino (a subspecies of the Sumatra) has vanished from Sabah entirely. Conservationists fear the Bornean pygmy elephant could be next.

It would be funded by the federal government. The project would also require paving a dirt road, bringing more traffic to the area. \nMany local people are lobbying for the bridge, arguing it will cut down journey times and allow much faster access to the nearest hospital. For remote villages, it would replace a private ferry, which is the only way for them to cross the river and can require several hours of waiting. \nLocal councilman Saddi Abdul Rahman argues that his constituents require the infrastructure update and that it won’t harm the local wildlife. “We are concerned about our wildlife but we also cannot ignore the needs of people there,” Saddi told the local press . As well as the controversial bridge, there are plans for a 1km-long viaduct nearby, which would raise traffic above the forest. He believes this would allow free passage beneath for elephants and other species and create a new eco-tourism experience . \nHowever, conservationists cite another bridge on the Kinabatangan as proof that the latest plans would cause irreversible damage. “The existing road and bridge at Batu Putih has acted as a barrier to wildlife movement, in particular dividing the populations of elephants on each side,” biologist Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy wrote in a letter opposing the Sukau bridge. “This example raises justifiable concern about the current proposal.” \nMeanwhile, conservationists say they have no evidence that wildlife ever uses other viaducts built in mainland Malaysia. \nResearch in many countries has shown that road building and new infrastructure leads to drastic increases in deforestation and wildlife poaching. \nWildlife presenter Steve Backshall has added his voice to the campaign against the Sukau bridge. He and his wife, Helen Glover, the Olympic champion rower, are currently planning to kayak non-stop for 125 miles in the UK to raise funds for the World Land Trust, which has purchased several wildlife corridors in the area to enable orangutans and elephants to move freely.

The gallery forest that flanks the river is critical as a wildlife corridor between existing forest reserves, and it’s frightening how close to the river the plantations are now getting. The river forests need to remain unbroken, to allow the dispersal and free movement of iconic species like orangutans and pygmy elephants. I can’t think of anywhere on the planet where so much can be achieved through the purchase of such small areas of land.” \nOpposition to the bridge has also come from the Sime Darby Foundation (YSD), the charitable arm of one of the world’s largest palm oil producers, which has said it may stop conservation funding in Sukau if the plan goes ahead. YSD has given more than £15m to conservation efforts in Sabah and is working on a programme with Nestlé to reforest 2,400 hectares. 'What can I do to help elephants?'

Now the public is awaiting an official environmental impact assessment, although construction machines have already started moving dirt. \nConservationists fear that their calls may be too late, and that politicians will prioritise development over wildlife. \nAttenborough concluded in his letter: “I strongly believe that Borneo is one of the most unique and biodiverse places on this planet, and that the world’s remaining wild spaces provide more than ecological services and opportunities for economic development; they also provide deep spiritual nourishment for ourselves and future generations of Sabahans and visitors alike.” This piece is part of a year-long series on Elephant Conservation – email us at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T16:37:41.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
