'Me time' is important, but not everybody can do it.\" \"Every time I look at [my daughter] Luna, I wonder, 'How on earth does anybody do this alone?' I have the utmost respect for mothers [and] single mothers,\" continued Teigen, adding that she thinks it's \"important to be very honest with people\" about the help she receives. \"I have my mother who lives with us, I have John, I have a nanny. I'm very outspoken about it, and when I see that I still have a difficult time, I just don't know how anyone else does it,\" she shared.
