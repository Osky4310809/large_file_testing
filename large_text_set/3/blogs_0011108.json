After Everton’s 3-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, he told French television that signing a new deal was not on his mind. \nChelsea and Manchester United have been linked with the former Stamford Bridge forward and it now looks likely Everton will have to cash in on the Belgium international. \nChelsea made an inquiry about re-signing Lukaku last summer, but were not prepared to pay Everton’s asking price, while United have been heavily linked with a move for Atlético Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann . \nThe news will be a crushing blow to Everton, who had hoped to persuade Lukaku to spearhead their European ambitions next season, with the backing of their majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri.
