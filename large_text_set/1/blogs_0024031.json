( TSLA ) has been an unexpected beneficiary of Donald Trump's ascension to the country's top post. The electric car maker's shares are up by almost 40% since Dec. 1, and they have gained 11.5% since the start of this year. \nThe dramatic rise in Tesla's share price has occurred despite the election of a president who appears averse to the idea of climate change. In fact, he famously said that climate change was a Chinese hoax . In contrast, Tesla CEO Elon Musk uses every available opportunity to state the urgency of climate change, which drives the company's mission to produce electric cars. (See also: Renewable Energy Suffers From Trump Win .) \nWhile their perspectives on climate change may differ, both Trump and Musk are in agreement on a couple of other points. \nThe first one is the need to manufacture in the United States. Approximately 83% of Tesla's employees, who are spread across its car and battery manufacturing plants, are in the United States. That headcount will increase in the future as Tesla ramps up its manufacturing facilities in Nevada and New York. \"Tesla stands at the epicenter of U.S. high tech manufacturing job creation, which may benefit more than just symbolically under the new administration,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a recent note. (See also: Tesla Announces Solar Panel Collaboration With Panasonic .) \nThe second reason why Tesla could benefit from the Trump administration is Musk's important role in it. Even as he has come down on automotive giants, such as Ford Motor Company ( F ) and General Motors Company ( GM ), for outsourcing manufacturing, President Trump has included Musk on his team of strategic advisors. \"Elon Musk has an important line of communication to Donald Trump,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who raised his price target for Tesla shares to $305 from $242, wrote in his note. \nAlthough Musk once said that Trump did not have \"the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,\" the open line of communication may help the president and the Tesla CEO appreciate each other's viewpoint. Musk came out yesterday in support of Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for Secretary of State, on Twitter, Inc.'s ( TWTR ) platform. (See also: Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tweets Support for Rex Tillerson .) \nIn a subsequent Twitter chat with tech mag Gizmodo, Musk provided additional details about his support. \" ... [Tillerson] has publicly acknowledged for years that a carbon tax could make sense. There is no better person to push for that to become a reality than Tillerson. This is what matters far more than pipelines or opening oil reserves,\" he wrote. \nBloomberg reports that Musk had raised the prospect of a carbon tax at a meeting with the president on Monday but got \"little or no support\" from other executives. A carbon tax would make gasoline and coal-generated electricity more expensive. In his chat with Gizmodo, Musk also explained that \"the more voices of reason that the president hears, the better. ... Are you aware of a single case where Trump bowed to protests or media attacks? Better that there are open channels of communication,\" he wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T06:01:10.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
