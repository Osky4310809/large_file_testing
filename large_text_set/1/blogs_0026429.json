Share Save \nNumerous technology companies have already voiced their opposition to the Trump administration's executive order from Friday banning the immigrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim nations. Today, Google employees from eight campuses have staged a work stoppage and walkout to protest the order as well. Super proud of all my fellow Googlers who showed up in a display of solidarity #NoBanNoWall #GooglersUnite pic.twitter.com/BvVip6eE6L — Mike Doherty (@mikedoherty_ca) January 30, 2017 The employees are coordinating and documenting their protest using the #GooglersUnite hashtag. Google does not have an official comment on the situation but a source within the company did state that the company supports the employees' rally. — Bri Connelly (@bricon5) January 30, 2017 According to company reps, Google Assistant project manager Soufi Esmaeilzadeh acted as the keynote speaker for the Mountain View campus. Esmaeilzadeh, an Iranian-born Canadian citizen who has lived in the US for 15 years (and employed by Google for the last five), was on a plane from San Francisco en route to Zurich when Trump's executive order took effect. After conferring with Google's legal team, she returned to the US via Boston and arrived back in the Bay Area yesterday. In addition to Esmaeilzadeh, other employees affected by the order spoke out as well as Alphabet CEO, Sundar Pichai, and company co-founder, Sergey Brin. The company estimates more than 2000 employees participated in total. Update : That didn't last long. According to eyewitnesses, the San Francisco branch of the protest has apparently already headed back to work. nd the Googlers are done.
