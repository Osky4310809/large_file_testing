Indeed, FLOTUS herself even responded with a cute AF #throwback pic of the whole Obama clan, and wait…we’re crying again.\nNow Michelle Obama and Jimmy Fallon have decided to surprise a group of unsuspecting FLOTUS fans and we DARE you not to get emotional. Firstly, Michelle took the opportunity on the show to write out some thank you notes to those people who have helped her during her tenure as First Lady. Stepping behind Jimmy’s talkshow host desk, she said thanks to the likes of her husband Barak (who she said wasn’t a lame duck but a silver fox).\nJimmy then offered his thanks to Michelle for her “right to bear arms.” \nThen, Jimmy and Michelle decided to play an emotional prank on a group of unsuspecting FLOTUS fans, who were thanking her for everything she’s done during the last eight years.\nAs people told their stories of how Michelle Obama has influenced and affected their lives, Jimmy and the the First Lady stood in the wings, waiting for that moment to reveal themselves and basically cause some seriously emotional breakdowns.\nNot only will people’s reactions to being surprised by THE Michelle Obama bring a tear to your eye, but the positive, kind, and life-affirming things that they say about the First Lady will also hit you right in the feels.\n“You have helped me and inspired me to walk in my purpose,” one person says. Watch the emotional clip below and get the tissues ready.\nWhile Michelle might not be our First Lady for much longer, we truly hope that she’ll continue to inspire a generation. And perhaps we’ll have #Michelle2020 to look forward to …\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T12:09:55.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
