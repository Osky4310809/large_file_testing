Petty also won a championship that year, his third and final NASCAR title, though he was a few months shy of Allison’s age at championship time. \nOf course, both men also have a history in the Daytona 500. \nPetty famously won the first Daytona 500 in 1959, in a photo finish that wasn’t decided until three days after the race ended. \nAllison won the Great American Race three times — in 1978, ’82 and most famously in ’88, when he and son Davey wound up 1-2 in one of the most memorable Daytona 500 finishes of all time. \nTune into FOX on Feb. 26 to see what kind of drama this year’s 500 will produce. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T16:49:42.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
