That’s the reality.” \nThe term “fake news” entered the political lexicon after it was revealed that the Russian government deliberately disseminated fabricated articles that hurt Hillary Clinton and helped Donald Trump with the aim of helping elect the Republican candidate during the 2016 election. It only refers to stories that are without any basis in fact and exist to serve a specific propagandist’s goal — such as that of Putin in aiding pro-Russia political movements throughout the Western world — and not simply any critical story that one side or the other in a political debate happens to dislike. \nThis hasn’t deterred Trump from referring to CNN as “fake news” for reporting on the existence of a dossier that included lurid allegations about the president or claiming negative polls are “fake news” because they contain unflattering statistics about public sentiment toward the president and his policies. If Gorka’s comment is any indication, the fake use of the term “fake news” is going to continue for quite some time. \nMatthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.
