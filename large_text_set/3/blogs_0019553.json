No matter how stylish the Range Rovers are off the showroom floor, there will be demand for further personalisation. \nThe design of the new Range Rover Velar – which debut at the Geneva Motor Show earlier this month – displays plenty of attention to detail, and a “visually reductive approach” was employed for it to look so strikingly clean. However, it will not escape the attention of tuners specialising in LR/RR such as Overfinch , Kahn and Brabus’ Startech , to name a few. \nThis irks Solihull, and the firm’s design director Gerry McGovern has vowed to put these tuners out of business by creating better variants of standard cars through LR’s own Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) division, Autocar reports. From L-R: Kahn Flying Huntsman 6×6, Startech’s Range Rover pick-up truck \n“It’s easy to take a product that’s already been created and put a little spoiler on it or whatever, but I’d like to see them design their own car. We see them taking our property and making a bit more profit,” McGovern said, without naming which cringe-worthy bodykit or styling house had annoyed him. \n“Well, we’re going to put them out of business through SVO. The opportunities we’re creating there, and the quality of our work, are much better,” he added. \nSVO will of course come up with good looking and good quality offerings, but we don’t think that alone will put the third-party customisers out of business. There will always be those who want to be different, and these attention seekers that make up a big portion of Land Rover’s current business most likely do not have an eye for good design like good ol’ Gerry. \nGALLERY: Range Rover Velar", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:57:16.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
