Beyond growing to 4 million daily active users and 1.25 million paid users, the company also just announced a long-awaited feature: threaded conversations . Plus, Slack has moved into seven global offices, including San Francisco, Vancouver, Melbourne, London, Toronto, Dublin, and now NYC. \nThe company has more than 650 employees and is looking to hire to fill up the 85 desk spaces at the new NYC headquarters. Alongside enterprise sales staff, new members of the Intelligence team will join former Foursquare SVP of product management Noah Weiss, who is leading Slack’s new Search, Learning and Intelligence department. \nAs he said on Medium : \nSlack is well on its way to building the new business operating system. Weaving in an intelligent layer is a huge opportunity to enhance the product for people who use Slack and the platform for developers who build on top of it. \nWeiss says that NY is a great market to head up that effort due to a wealth of technical talent, the nascent startup ecosystem, and the diversity of people and industries in the city. \nClick through to take a tour of the new Slack NYC office. 1/10 \nThis is Slack’s new office – it opened today and marks the company’s first presence in New York City. 2/10 \nIt’s in the East Village – at Lafayette Street and Astor Place. 3/10 \nThe office is on the top floor of a landmark building built in the 1880s, and totals more than 15,000 square feet. 4/10 \nThe new location will be home to the company’s enterprise sales efforts, as well as AI research – which will be called the Search, Learning and Intelligence division and led by Noah Weiss , former SVP of Product at Foursquare.
