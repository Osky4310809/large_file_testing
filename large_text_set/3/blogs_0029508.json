The visuals, directed by Sophie Jones, continue to explore Etta’s journey into celebrating the diversity and sensuality of female beauty.\n\nEtta’s uncompromising yet candid songwriting style and delivery shines through in the new visuals, set in Hackney, London. Skateboards, lifts and stairwells all serve as the mediums for romance between several beautiful young women in the straight/ gay and bi communities in the visuals which compliment Etta’s slick vocals. Produced in collaboration with producer and Chris Loco – who is also part of the OddChild stable which champions the likes of Avelino and Emili Sandé – the track has got us really excited for Etta Bond’s next moves in 2017. We caught up with the singer over email below to talk her inspirations, the motives behind the track and plans for this year.\nHow did you first get into music? \nI started writing a diary at about the age of 7. I then began adding structure to my words as well as melody – singing is the voice of my heart. Expression has always come naturally to me. It’s what I’m here to do.\nWho are your musical influences? \nBillie Holiday, Amy Winehouse, that old school Destiny’s Child, D’Angelo, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu and Slum Village, to name a few!\nWho’s been the most inspiring person to work with?\n\nThat’s like asking which of my ex’s was best in bed… I’d have to give you a top 3, in no particular order: Labrinth, Raf Riley and Chris Loco. They’ve brought so much out of me over the years. I swear, they’re magical. There’s no other explanation.\nThe track is silky smooth and contains an empowering message. What were your motives behind the songs lyrics?\n\nThe message behind the song touches on things we face as women every day. It’s vital for us to look out for our friends as if they were our sisters. I want women to not only recognize their own worth, but the worth of every single woman out there. We need each other! There’s no relationship like the one between two women and I wanted to celebrate that.\nThe video is really style heavy. What influences your style?\n\nI tend to see my style as armour. Punk culture, street wear, goth vibes. Sometimes I think people can find me/my style intimidating but those people aren’t for me. I hope to attract those who see with more than just their eyes. Underneath it all I’m very sensitive and loving. You just have to chip away a bit first.\nWhat are your plans for the rest of the year?\n\nI’ve got this music stacked up and ready to go, there are some more visuals on the way and I’ve got a headline show coming up which will be really special. It feels good to be back.\nIn other music news, watch Gorrilaz incredible return to music in their new video for “Saturnz Barz” alongside Popcaan, here . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T14:30:11.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
