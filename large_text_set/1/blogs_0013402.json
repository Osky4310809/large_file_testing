Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com TownNews.com Content Exchange \nGreetings from Cardinals Winter Warm-Up at the Hyatt Regency in downtown St. Louis. Stay tuned here for news, notes and quotes throughout the event. Team Post-Dispatch will have you covered from start to finish. \nCardinals outfielder Randal Grichuk need a little more than a month to recover from knee surgery he had at the end of the 2016 season to address soreness and inflammation that followed him throughout the summer. Grichuk described a clicking, irritation, and soreness in his left knee -- and he suggested that it started in late April. \nGrichuk had surgery to remove loose cartilage in the left knee. \nA center fielder last year, Grichuk has been recast as the team's starting left fielder for this season with the arrival of Dexter Fowler. He said he wasn't sure how the soreness in his knee limited his movement in the outfield, but said it hasn't limited his preparation for this season. Grichuk has altered some of his speed work for this winter, working on more deceleration than he had in the past. \n-- Derrick Goold \nWong compares last season to punch in the mouth \nKolten Wong spent last year's Cardinals Winter Warm-Up in campaign mode, making his case for the top spot in the lineup and starter's reps and second base. \nHe started this year's chat with reporters by announcing he's going to let his play speak for itself. \n\"I'm not going into the season expecting to be the second baseman,\" Wong said Sunday. \"Last year, I kind of came in with that mindset, and it kind of backfired. I want to come into this year ready to play, ready to earn my spot, ready to earn my way on this team.\" \nWong was quick to praise new teammate and starting center fielder Dexter Fowler. He is a big believer in the club's push for improved athleticism across the board, which he has phrased as a quest to \"bring the speed back to St. Louis.\" But Wong is keeping his personal goals private after a humbling and motivating 2016. This is a different approach from the outspoken infielder who last season announced his predicted home run totals before the season started. \n\"I got punched in the mouth. Straight up,\" Wong said of a season that saw a stint in Memphis and a brief experiment in the outfield. \"Last year, I literally got punched in the mouth. Now it's time for me to just understand that last year is last year. Let's see what happens.\" \nThe Cardinals see Wong as their starting second baseman, general manager John Mozeliak confirmed Sunday. Wong has the mindset that he has to earn it. \n\"I'd say a block,\" Wong responded when asked if he has a chip on his shoulder. \n- Ben Frederickson \nMOZELIAK: NO HACKING UPDATE \nMajor League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said in November that the time had come for resolution in the Cardinals' hacking scandal . \nThe wait continues. \n\"It's hard to plan because it's an unknown,\" Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak said Sunday. \"In terms of timing of it, I really don't know. There is a lot of speculation going on that it might be sooner than later, but I don't know.\" \n-Ben Frederickson \nMUDCATS, 2.0 \nDuring the heyday of the Gas House Gang, Cardinals ragamuffin Pepper Martin and his pals would actually play music to pass the time on trips and even entertain fans before the game. They called themselves The Mudcat Band, and they play a part in the colorful history of that Cardinals era. They even wore matching bandannas, according to pictures of the time. \nLooks like the 2017 club has the start of its own Mudcats. \nDuring the parade of players on Sunday at the Winter Warm-Up, several have described how they picked up musical instruments in the past year. Marco Gonzales attempted to learn the guitar during his rehab from Tommy John surgery, and Luke Weaver recently played for a band, Smiths. His brother-in-law is part of the team and put Weaver to work on the Cajon drum. \n\"Maybe in the future ...,\" Weaver mused. \nThe lead for the Mudcats revival is already set, too. Adam Wainwright is hosting a Karaoke contest for charity Monday at Dave & Buster's in Maryland Heights, Mo. He has been advertising the event with video of him signing in the shower. Wainwright would be on lead vocals. \n-- Derrick Goold \nMOZELIAK: DOZIER REPORT WAS 'FAKE NEWS' \nDuring his question-and-answer session with fans Sunday at the Winter Warm-Up, Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak said he found out about the team's reported interest in Twins second baseman Bryan Dozier at the same time the world did. From his phone \"blowing up\" with questions, even ones from staff members asking about where the Cardinals and Twins were in negotiations. \n\"I learned a new word this year,\" Mozeliak said. \"Fake news.\" \nA report out of the Twin Cities suggested that the Cardinals were one of the teams pursuing a trade for the Twins' slugging second baseman. That circle didn't square with the Cardinals very public -- and even private, when other teams asked -- support of second baseman Kolten Wong as their starter. The Cardinals had reached out to other teams this winter to gauge the trade market for players, and that included gathering a frame of reference for their own players. \nIf they knew what a top-tier second baseman was going to command on this pricey trade market then they also could evaluate their own players, and they could evaluate their own offers. \nA trade for Dozier was not one of the Cardinals' targets. \n\"That was news to me,\" Mozeliak told the crowd. \n-- Derrick Goold WEAVER EXPANDS HIS REPERTOIRE \nLuke Weaver's first six big league appearances went well. The former Florida State star struck out 39 hitters in his first 31 innings and posted a 3.48 earned-run average. \nHe looked very much like a strong first-round pick (27th overall in 2014) and the Next New Thing for the pitching staff. But then he got rocked in his last three appearances, allowing 17 runs (11 earned) in 5 1/3 innings. \nSo what did he learn through that experience? \n\"I obviously want to establish a good breaking pitch. I think the change-up has been good for me,\" Weaver said Sunday. \"Finding the curveball and slider/cutter, those things, finally crafting those, making sure those can be a weapon for me out there as well.\" \nWeaver rose quickly through the Cardinals system, but arrived as basically a fastball-change-up pitcher. And that caught up to him. \n\"For me, to be able to have those three established pitches that all can be weapons is huge,\" he said.\"When guys get up there and maybe you have three or four pitches and only two of them are working well, you're a two-pitch guy at that point. I think that's maybe where I ran into a little trouble. I just needed to establish the breaking ball stuff. That's something I'm continuing to develop on and hopefully will have this year.\" \nSpring training games will afford him that opportunity. \n\"Yeah, sure, I think that is something that is definitely going to be done,\" Weaver said. \"The more you throw it, the more comfortable you get. It's hard to simulate live games with those pitches. Even in live BPs and such, those are good, but nothing like the adrenalin and having the rush of being out there on the field.\" \n--Jeff Gordon GONZALES EYES SPRING RETURN \nPitcher Marco Gonzales used his down time to knock off another six credit hours toward his college degree, taking philosophy and social justice classes. He took up playing the guitar -- a couple of country tunes -- and also expanded his skill set in the kitchen. \nBut what Gonzales really wants to do is pitch. He hasn't done much of that the past two seasons, struggling with shoulder troubles in 2015 and missing the 2016 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery. \n\"Everybody who has been under the knife will tell you that being away from the game, being in rehab is one of the toughest things you can go through,\" he said. \"And they're right. But I learned a lot about myself, learned a lot about patience, dedication, my work ethic. It was all tested.\" \nNow he feels good to go. \"Right now I'm out to 90 feet,\" Gonzales said Sunday at the Winter Warmup. \"So long toss is going good, just building arm strength.\" \nHe hopes to be back throwing off the mound during spring training and throwing to hitters before the end of exhibition play. Health permitting, he will likely open the season in the Memphis starting rotation. \n\"After spring training, I would say it's going to be more of a baseball decision, in my hope, at that point that I'm ready to get in games,\" said Gonzales, a first-round pick from Gonzaga in 2013. \n\"It feels a little different, but that's just 'cause I think there is a different part in my elbow now, I have a new wheel,\" Gonzales said. \"It's a little different, but it feels normal, it feels good. Everything so far has been encouraging.\" \n— Jeff Gordon FALL SUCCESS MOVES GOMBER CLOSER \nLeft-handed starting pitcher Austin Gomber missed with a finger injury last season at Double-A Springfield, so he was fresh for the Arizona Fall League. \nHe made the most of it by posting a 5-1 record and a 2.14 earned-run average in seven appearances. He struck out 33 batters in 33 2/3 innings and held opposing hitters to a .205 batting average. \n\"I don't know how many innings I would have finished with if I hadn't hurt my finger,\" Gomber told reporters at the Winter Warmup Sunday. \"It was kind of like a blessing in disguise. It allowed me to go out to Arizona and obviously have a good season out there.\" \nThe AFL is a showcase for elite prospects, so Gomber's excellent performance drew industry-wide attention. \n\"I was just trying to pitch well,\" said Gomber, a fourth-round 2014 pick from Florida Atlantic University. \"I just kind of did the same thing everywhere else I've been. People just take a little bit more, notice it a little bit more when you're out in Arizona. For me going out there., I was just trying to have a good year, have a good season out there. I think the rest will take care of itself. \n\"I didn't change any pitches. I threw the same pitches I've thrown everywhere else I've been. I kind of went out there and just kind of everything clicked for that six-week period. Obviously you're going to go through ups and downs. I think I just had good timing. I was pitching well at the right time.\" \nWith Jaime Garcia's trade to Atlanta, the Cardinals don't have a left-handed starter at the big league level. That could create an opportunity for Gomber or fellow lefty Gonzales some time soon. \n\"I don't think it matters if you're left or right-handed,\" Gomber said. \"I just think once you get closer, you get to Double-A, you get to the fall league, whatever it may be, you can smell it, you're closer, I think you create the opportunities for yourself. Whichever hand you may throw with, I think if you have success, you will get an opportunity.\" \n--Jeff Gordon \nNoon: Carson Kelly, Kolten Wong (Station 1); Carlos Martinez, Rick Horton*, Mike Shannon (Station 2) \n1 p.m.: Luke Weaver, Randal Grichuk (Station 1); Carlos Martinez, Rick Horton* (Station 2) \n2 p.m.: Luke Weaver, Randal Grichuk, Aledmys Diaz (Station 1); Stephen Piscotty, Orlando Cepeda, Larry Jaster* (Station 2) \n3 p.m.: Todd Worrell*, Kyle McClellan*, Aledmys Diaz (Station 1); Stephen Piscotty, Sam Tuivailala (Station 2) \n4 p.m.: Todd Worrell*, Kyle McClellan*, Bill Mueller (Station 1); Sam Tuivailala \n*Players signing free autographs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T00:19:02.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
