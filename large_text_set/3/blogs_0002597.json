That Taco Bell commercial seemed a bit racist.

We immediately re-edited the commercial and removed the original version from the air.” \nAccording to AgencySpy, the commercial was accidentally released. \nA Deutsch ad for Taco Bell’s Naked Chicken Chalupa was initially released in two versions, one of which found the brand receiving some criticism for perceived racial insensitivity. A tipster claims that the agency re-edited the offending footage, but a network mistakenly ran the initial version at least once … and from there it spread across social media. \nThe old version can still be seen on YouTube. \nAnd here’s the edited version.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T04:17:20.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
