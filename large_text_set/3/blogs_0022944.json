The Big Spring Sale , which begins today, is good for travel between April 4 and June 14. Many blackout dates apply, including Memorial Day weekend (May 20 until May 31). \nHighlights from the sale include a $49 trip from Washington, D.C. to Charleston, South Carolina, a $74 flight from Fort Lauderdale to Barbados, and an $80 flat fare from New York City to Bermuda . \nFor less than $100, travelers can also visit Mexico City, Orlando, and Savannah, Georgia from cities across the East Coast. To take advantage of the flash sale, tickets must be booked by midnight on March 22. \nTravelers willing to “splurge” can reserve a $215 flight to Jamaica from New York City, a $139 trip to Costa Rica from Orlando, and a $508 round-trip flight between Boston and San Francisco . \nJetBlue isn’t the only airline offering cheap deals. Until April 6, Southwest is offering one-way spring and summer fares starting at $52 one-way.
