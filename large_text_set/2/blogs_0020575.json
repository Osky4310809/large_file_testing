Whenever you think of an Aditya Chopra film, you think of romance, beautiful women, epic love stories and strong characters… While Chopra’s films are out there for the world to see, he himself is quite the social recluse. Or let’s say ‘media recluse’. Aditya hates being photographed by the media and makes an active effort to stay away from the limelight. \nUday Chopra just shared this throwback photo of his brother and it’s the cutest! It’s also one of those rare occasions where you’ll find Aditya Chopra’s photo on the Internet!
