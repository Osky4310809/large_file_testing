This edition includes a new Suggestions for Further Reading by Jennifer Buehler.At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate. This far from civilization they can do anything they want. Anything. But as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far removed from reality as the hope of being rescued. From Publishers Weekly Nov 01, 2002 – William Golding's Lord of the Flies is now available in a newly remastered, re-released audiobook edition from Listening Library, performed by the author. This audio update of the classic YA novel about the struggles of a group of British schoolboys stranded on a desert island comes 48 years after the print version first appeared in 1954 and 26 years after Golding was first recorded reading the book. © Publishers Weekly The Lord of the Flies by Ramesaz Fascinating book. It reflects the true nature of man, who when left alone without the influence of a higher spiritual law reverts to the animal instincts within us. It also exemplifies how Power can corrupt the soul and turn ordinary good people into power hungry tyrants, as was the case with Jack. Well written and held one's attention throughout. A literary giant's masterpiece by Vhcgvhj This book was written by William Golding who was a literary giant and has my respect it has a solid plot and does not move too slow. He does not use nonsense words like \"'nuff.\" he deserves everyones respect and those who disagree are intellectual eunuchs. Amazing book by eatsleepdev I feel like I should have read this a long time ago. I'm glad that I finally got around to it.
