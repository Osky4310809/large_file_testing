In Boston. That shit insults my intelligence. My grandmother knows who Gronk is and she’s been dead for 10 years.\nAnyway, this was some good, old-fashioned fan meets legend content. The driver putting Big Ben in the top three QBs to ever live was an egregious move, but all-in-all, he seemed like a good dude. I have no basis for this but I’m going to chose to believe that after Elway took a picture with the driver, Elway split without paying the cab fare. How do you spin that if you’re the driver? “Hey check out this picture of me with an NFL legend? Pretty cool huh? Ya he was a huge boner, but I look decent in the pic so I think I’ll keep it.”\nP.S. Elway’s wife, I got two years of high school football under my belt if you’re trying to trade the old cow in for a young buck.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:20:50.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
