Even more translation: save the whales by killing babies. More: save a plant, kill a child. Nope, not done yet. The Sierra Club: We love trees, we hate babies. Empowering the environment by murdering people. ‘ At the Sierra Club, we care about women’s rights. So please snuff your baby girl in the womb. Just think about all the napkins you’ll spare by cutting her up in the womb,’” he wrote. \nAs an added bonus, The Daily Caller noted that Brune and the Sierra Club’s staunch opposition to Trump’s immigration policies, such as a border wall, was markedly different than the position they held just four years ago, when they were staunch advocates of a border wall and tough immigration controls to help better protect the environment in the U.S. \nOnce again, Carlson succeeded in exposing a left-wing loon for the partisan hack they really are, making it crystal clear that the current Sierra Club is less concerned with saving the planet than they are with promoting a progressive agenda, and will choose that agenda over the climate if there is a conflict between the two. \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter so that everyone can watch the Sierra Club director get exposed as a left-wing hack. What do you think of the Sierra Club director being exposed for supporting leftist causes not related to saving the planet? Scroll down to comment below!
