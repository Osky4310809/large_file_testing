Source: Nintendo \nNintendo Co. ’s introduction of its new Switch game machine got off to a wobbly start. \nHours before the company’s executives prepared to take the stage, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. listed the new device for C$399 ($304) on its Canadian website, a price that was above analysts’ estimates and slightly more than the cost of a Xbox One or PlayStation 4 console. Nintendo shares fell as much as 3.9 percent, mirroring a drop seen in October when the Switch was first unveiled. \nTatsumi Kimishima, Nintendo’s president, will unveil details including the price and release date of the Switch, its new game console, at an event at 1 p.m. on Friday in Tokyo. \nNintendo is counting on the Switch to end years of pain at its console division, which released a successor to the popular Wii in 2012 that flopped. Not only was the Wii U the worst-selling major home console in history, Nintendo also shunned the smartphone market for years. The Kyoto-based company’s long-awaited foray into mobile gaming got off to a rough start, with last month’s debut of Super Mario Run on iPhones disappointing fans and investors alike. That fueled concerns it was losing its ability to deliver hit entertainment products. \nThe price, if confirmed, would surpass most analyst estimates. Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s Takeshi Koyama last week wrote he expects the Switch to go for around $249 to $279. Macquarie Securities analysts analysts David Gibson and Aya Haruyama wrote this week they expect a price of around $250. \nAt around $300, the Switch would cost more than Sony Corp.’s $260 PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Corp.’s $240 Xbox One, based on current U.S. retail pricing. Nintendo had botched the launch of its 3DS handheld console in 2011 by overpricing it at $250. It slashed the price to $170 five months later following poor sales.

As a portable gadget, the device sports a screen, attachable joysticks and battery. Nintendo is betting that the ability to play the same titles indoors and outdoors will appeal to gamers who now play one set of games at home and a different collection on their smartphones when out and about.\nStill, that means the Switch will have to compete with smartphones, which most people already own and use. It’s unclear if consumers will want to carry another bulky device when smartphones already fill their spare moments with millions of games, apps and videos. \n“There is a possibility that this proposed new game playing experience will not immediately be understood,” Takeshi Koyama, an analyst at Mizuho Financial Group Inc., wrote in a report last week. \nNintendo’s promise of delivering high-end graphics in a portable package also rests largely on its ability to maximize battery life. Last year’s Note 7 debacle was a reminder of the challenges even experienced hardware manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co. face in pushing battery efficiency. \n“Our biggest concern is battery life, which we think will remain an issue,” Macquarie Securities said. \nSince its Wii peak about a decade ago, Nintendo shares have slumped by about two-thirds, losing more than $50 billion in market value. In October, Kimishima told Bloomberg the Switch will play a central role in restoring operating profits to a level of around 100 billion yen per year.
