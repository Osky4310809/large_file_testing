It took the brand seven years in the lab to develop the perfect product, the report says. The end result: A necktie is engineered from sugar, water, salts, and yeast. ( According to Bolt , yeast produces silk protein during fermentation.) The process is eco-friendly too; Bolt uses plant sugar to power the production, where many brands use petroleum. \nThe limited-edition line is launching this weekend at South by Southwest. Only 50 of the ties were made, and each retail for $314. There’s a lottery to apply for one ( boltthreads.com ), which ends on March 14 . \nBut the small quantity is just the beginning. Last year, the tech brand announced a partnership with outdoor mainstay Patagonia. What’s next? Spider silk jackets, beanies, sleeping bags? On second though, we’re not sold on the idea of sleeping in a bag so closely tied to spiders. Maybe later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:10:43.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
