See full tour dates on the poster below. \nThe release of Maco’s highly anticipated debut album for Motown/Capitol Records, to be called Children of the Rage, has been stalled. The label’s signee told Billboard back in January 2016 that he was hoping to release it by summer of last year. \nUnveiling the song “Monster” a few weeks ago, Maco wrote, “This track is on #ChildrenOfTheRage, but since I’ve been unable to drop it, I made three more albums and decided I’ll be dropping songs from it at random.” \nLast month, he released an EP titled For Scott , as a tribute to Kid Cudi . \nBest known for his 2014 debut single, “U Guessed It”— which went viral and hit the Billboard Hot 100 — Maco lost his right eye in a near-fatal car accident this summer. \nnew music", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T04:08:10.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
