Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PA   08.31 GMT Last modified on   08.38   Share on Messenger Close \nThe BBC’s security correspondent, Frank Gardner, has criticised the treatment of disabled passengers travelling by plane after being left on an easyJet flight when it landed at Gatwick airport. \nGardner, whose legs were paralysed when he was shot six times by al-Qaida sympathisers in Saudi Arabia in 2004, said on Twitter he was left on the plane after all other passengers had departed because special assistance staff failed to turn up. \nThe journalist, who was returning from the French Alps, blamed the outsourcing group OCS, which is responsible for disability access at the airport, but also criticised easyJet for not using an airbridge that was standing within sight of the plane.

January 8, 2017 Frank Gardner (@FrankRGardner) For those kindly following my @Gatwick_Airport hassles the responsibility rests primarily with @Ocs_Assist but @easyJet ignored airbridge pic.twitter.com/qGdNK5WNfL January 8, 2017 \nGardner later said on Twitter that Gatwick airport, easyJet and OCS had all responded and pledged to investigate the issue of disabled passengers being stranded on flights. The Guardian has approached easyJet and OCS for comment. \nLast week the award-winning Paralympic athlete and disabilities campaigner, Anne Wafula Strike, told the Guardian she was forced to wet herself on a three-hour train journey after the CrossCountry service failed to provide an accessible toilet. \nWafula Strike, 42, a British wheelchair racer who has no use of her legs, said she was “completely robbed of her dignity”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T15:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T10:42:11.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
