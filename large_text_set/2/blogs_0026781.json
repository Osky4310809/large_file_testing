The California DMV countered that the vehicles were, in fact, autonomous under DMV standards, and the department ended up revoking registrations for Uber’s autonomous cars. Uber announced that it would stop its pilot program in San Francisco and take the program to Arizona.\nIf Uber had obtained an autonomous testing license under California's guidelines, the company would have had to publicly report accidents as well as how often engineers testing the system had to disengage.\nDuring the squabble between Uber and the California DMV, a video was posted in which an Uber self-driving car was seen driving through a red light at an intersection in San Francisco in front of the Museum of Modern Art. At the time, Uber spokesperson Chelsea Kohler stated that the incident was due to human error: “This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers.”\nBut the unnamed sources provided The New York Times with company documents noting that, “In this case, the car went through a red light,” and it did so on five other occasions.\n\"All told, the mapping programs used by Uber’s cars failed to recognize six traffic lights in the San Francisco area,\" the Times wrote.\nAccording to NYT , Kohler clarified on Friday: “Our self-driving technology required human intervention. The vehicle operator had time to intervene, but failed to take over before crossing the stop line and manually proceeded through the protected crosswalk.”\nArs contacted Uber for additional information, but the company has not responded.\nArs also contacted the Arizona DMV on the status of Uber’s pilot program within the state. The public information office responded with the statement: \"ADOT works with Uber and other companies testing self-driving technology to create the most supportive environment possible while also promoting public safety.\"\nThe revelations are more bad news for a company that just last week was slapped with a lawsuit from Waymo , (Google’s self-driving car division) that alleges Anthony Levandowski, a former Google autonomous car engineer and a current Uber engineer, stole company trade secrets and infringed a patent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:19:17.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
