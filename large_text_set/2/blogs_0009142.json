Yet, there were some detractors who commented on her body and, during On Air with Ryan Seacrest on February 9th, Gaga explained why she posted about the body shaming on Instagram.\nBecause the Internet can be a cruel place sometimes, some people’s main takeaway from Lady Gaga’s halftime performance during Super Bowl LI was that she had “fat rolls” on her stomach. While we wouldn’t normally like to give attention to such body shamers, Gaga responded in a perfectly-worded Instagram post .\nShe then told Seacrest during a phone interview exactly why she posted about the topic:\n“I couldn’t ignore that I saw my fans talking about that and that it upset them. I think other people maybe that are just like normal girls and guys that either have their own body image issues or just didn’t think it was a nice thing to say [were upset].” “I just thought I would impart some of my positive attitude about it so that they felt like they had someone that was strong on their side.” \nHere’s her Instagram post for reference/daily inspiration to remind you to: “Be you, and be relentlessly you.”\nI heard my body is a topic of conversation so I wanted to say, I'm proud of my body and you should be proud of yours too. No matter who you are or what you do. I could give you a million reasons why you don't need to cater to anyone or anything to succeed. Be you, and be relentlessly you. That's the stuff of champions. thank you so much everyone for supporting me. I love you guys.

Instead, she felt she should address it to remind others that no one should let the types of comments that she is receiving hurt them.\nShe told Seacrest she was trying to infuse her positive attitude into the situation and that she did. Lady Gaga took something as hateful as body shaming and made it empowering for all of her fans.\nSo whether you are body shamed one day (hopefully not) or just are down about the way you look, channel your inner Gaga and be proud of your body.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:58:17.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
