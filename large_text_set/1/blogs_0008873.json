[2] On 2 May 1998, both of her parents were killed in the Battle of Hogwarts . [2] Bellatrix's husband, Rodolphus Lestrange , survived the battle, but was sent to Azkaban for his crimes. [2] \nThis left the infant Delphi an orphan as her father had been. Euphemia Rowle took Delphi in and raised her, allegedly only because she was offered a substantial amount of gold. [3] According to Delphi, Rowle was not fond of her. [3] She kept a pet Augurey and claimed that it cried because it knew Delphi was going to meet a \"sticky end.\" [3] \nDelphi did not attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . [4] She apparently had little to no contact with other children, claiming that she didn't have a best friend at the age of 14, and that she even invented an imaginary one when she was younger. [4] \nAt some point, Rodolphus was either released from Azkaban, or escaped a second time. [2] He told Delphi about her true heritage and the prophecy he believed she was meant to fulfil. [2] An ambitious plan Edit \nAt some point, Delphi found Amos Diggory , placing him under a Confundus Charm in order to pass herself off as his niece, Delphi Diggory, and to ensure he did her bidding. \nOn 31 August , 2020, Amos Diggory went to Harry Potter and urged him to use a Time-Turner to go back in time to the Triwizard Tournament and save his son, Cedric , who was murdered on the orders of Voldemort after winning the event. \nHarry refused, but his son, Albus , overheard the conversation and later, along with his friend, Scorpius Malfoy , decided to help the Diggorys to alter history and save Cedric. Albus and Scorpius visited the nursing home where Amos Diggory lived and where Delphi, posing as his niece, pretended to take care of him. \nAlbus, Scorpius, and Delphi sneaked into the Ministry of Magic and stole a Time-Turner. Using the Time-Turner, Albus and Scorpius seriously altered past events, creating two alternative realities, with the first seeing Hermione the bitter Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher while Ron was in a less happy marriage to Padma Patil , and the second seeing a world where the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army lost the Battle of Hogwarts . After many attempts, including Albus being erased by their changes, Scorpius managed to restore the correct timeline, and decided to destroy the Time-Turner on their own, not trusting the Ministry to destroy it. \nAlbus then sent an owl to Delphi. She arrived to Hogwarts just in time to see how he planned to try to destroy the Time-Turner. Albus wanted to apologise to her that they would not be able to go back in time to save Cedric. He and Scorpius explained that in the new reality they had created, Cedric’s Triwizard humiliation had turned him into an angry, bitter young man who became a Death Eater and eventually murdered Neville Longbottom before he could destroy Nagini , helping to usher in the era of the Dark Lord. Delphi said that Cedric would have understood, suggesting they should destroy the Time-Turner together, and explain to her uncle why Cedric would not be saved. \nAfter Albus handed her the Time-Turner, both boys noticed a black tattoo of a bird on her back. Delphi said it was an Augurey , which reminded her of her childhood as an orphan when she was raised by the Rowle family. The boys realised she was an enemy based on Scorpius recalling references to 'the Augurey' in the timeline where Voldemort won, but Delphi pulled out a wand and bound them together. \nDelphi planned to travel back in time to ensure Cedric's survival in the third task of the Tournament (Unable to go back to the first two as the boys' actions made those events too temporally unstable). Albus refused, but she threatened to kill Scorpius. Craig Bowker Jr , another Hogwarts student, rushed up to say that the whole school was looking for them, then was killed by Delphi immediately, similar to the nature of her parents who didn't hesitate to kill. \nDelphi took Albus and Scorpius back in time with her, but they refused to cooperate. As Delphi prepared to kill Scorpius, she was struck from behind by an unsuspecting Cedric Diggory, who thought the scene was simply part of the Triwizard task. He freed the boys before returning to the challenge. \nThen Delphi staggered to her feet and picked up the Time-Turner, but Albus and Scorpius managed to grab the device. They raced through time once again, but once they arrived, Delphi destroyed the Time-Turner and flew away. \nAlbus and Scorpius discovered that they had been transported to 30 October 1981 — the day before Harry Potter’s parents were murdered by Voldemort. The boys realised that Delphi intended to stop Voldemort from trying to kill Harry, and thus triggering his own destruction when his Killing Curse rebounded on him due to Lily Potter 's loving sacrifice . \nMeanwhile, the boys' parents were looking for them. Ron Weasley told Harry he had seen Albus with an older girl the night before. Harry thought he must mean Delphi Diggory, Amos’s niece. They went to see Amos, who told them that he never had a niece. The Confundus Charm that Delphi had cast on him had waned. \nThe adults raced to Delphi’s room and found there writings revealing Delphi to be Tom Riddle 's daughter and that she believed she could restore him to power following the words of a prophecy. Confrontation \" You can't remake your life. You'll always be an orphan. That never leaves you. \" —Harry Potter's words to Delphi about her father [src] \nAlbus and Scorpius were able to send a message to their parents by leaving a message on Harry's old baby blanket, treated with a potion that would only become visible when it interacted with another potion Albus had spilled on the blanket shortly before this final trip back through time. Now aware of where their children were, Harry, Ginny , Draco , Ron, and Hermione headed back to Godric’s Hollow in 1981 using another Time-Turner in order to help the boys. They found Albus and Scorpius, and all of them hid in a church, from which they could look out for Delphi without being seen. \nHarry volunteered to transfigure himself into Voldemort and lead Delphi into a trap. The others planned to wait in the church behind the large wooden doors until Harry was able to lure her inside. \nDelphi finally appeared and Harry (disguised as Voldemort) pretended not to know who she was. She explained that she was the child of Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Lestrange. \nHe told her that together they could become an unstoppable force, but, by that time, the transfiguration had begun to fade. She saw that she was actually speaking to Harry, claiming she had studied him and knew him better than her father did. She locked the doors to prevent the others jumping out to help. Without a wand, Harry was forced to hide beneath a church pew while she attacked him. When Delphi was about to kill him, Albus popped up through a hatch in the floor, throwing a wand to his father. Together, they were able to overpower Delphi. \nDelphi begged them to kill her or wipe her mind clean . She claimed that she had only wanted to meet her father and be with him. Albus wanted to kill her to avenge Craig, but Harry stopped him. In a moment of empathy for her, Harry told her that she must learn to live with the fact that she will always be an orphan, as he has. \nDelphi was then imprisoned in Azkaban for her crimes. [5] Personality and Traits Edit \nDelphini is extremely calculating, demonstrating a keen intellect and profound talents for manipulation and exploitation, much like her father was when he was younger. Exactly like Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange, Delphini was intensely sadistic, being easily able to cast the Cruciatus Curse with malicious intent and proving to be a dangerous opponent for even Harry Potter. Aside from being malicious, Delphini was independent and highly determined, orchestrating a complicated plan to restore Voldemort without any immediate assistance that she didn't gain through manipulating or exploiting other people. She was ruthless and easily capable of killing in pursuit of her goals. Despite being this dangerous for her ruthlessness and intelligence, Delphi was fierce-tempered and could lose control of herself if something didn't go according to plan. Her temper led to her attacking Harry Potter when he was revealed to have been disguised as Voldemort, self-righteously angry that he had fooled her and that he had destabilised her plan so much. When Harry and his friends defeated her, she begged for death or to be Obliviated, indicating that her pride had been crippled by her being defeated by him. \nSimilar to her father, Delphini has an obsessive trait towards Harry Potter. Even claimed that she had studied him and knew him even better than her father ever did during his lifetime. Magical abilities and skills Edit Duelling : Delphi is an extremely skilled duelist, able to temporarily hold her own against the combined might of four exceptionally powerful duelists, including Minister for Magic Hermione Granger , and Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement Harry Potter . Parseltongue : Delphi is a Parselmouth, a trait she inherited from her father, Lord Voldemort. She uses Parseltongue code to conceal her room. Flying : Delphi is able to fly without support, much like her father. Wandless magic : Delphi is exceptionally skilled at Wandless magic, capable of locking doors with her hands while confronting Harry Potter . Dark Arts : Delphi demonstrated considerable talent for dark magic, using both the Cruciatus Curse and the Killing Curse, both of which require both power and ability.
