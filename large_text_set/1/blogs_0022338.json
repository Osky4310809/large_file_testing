To them, serenity is purposeless. \nBoth are following precarious roads. \nThe seeker is prone to spirituality addiction, abandoning his responsibility to others and to the world. \nThe activist is prey to the allure of achievement and acknowledgment, materialism and its pleasures, until his original goals may be corrupted and fall away. \nThe safe and sturdy path is to travel both roads at once. Bring wisdom into action. Act with serenity. \nYes, they are two opposite roads. But that is precisely where Gâ€‘d is found.
