Solange Knowles stepped onto the red carpet in a pleated metallic gown, looking every bit like a golden goddess. The structural silhouette reminded us of several dresses we saw on the Fall 2017 runways , which proves when it comes to fashion, Solange is already ahead of the trend. Luck seems to be on her side, too. The singer won her first Grammy of the night for best R&B performance for \"Cranes in the Sky,\" and now, she has our vote for best dressed of the night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:17:11.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
