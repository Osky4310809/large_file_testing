LOUIS (KMOX) – The worst is still to come from the ice storm hitting St. Louis and most of Missouri on Friday, says the Missouri Department of Transportation and the Missouri State Highway Patrol. \nA news conference was held by the two organizations at MoDOT’s Chesterfield headquarters Friday at 10:30 a.m. to explain how they plan to battle the icy conditions throughout the day. \nThanks were extended to all the citizens who decided to stay safe at home, so MoDOT’s 200-plus trucks could continue to treat roads, and the fully staffed highway patrol could deal with multiple emergency situations. \nRelated story: Winter Storm 2017 Local Business Closings \nThe southbound lanes of Interstate 55 in South County were shut down for about an hour, and two fatal accidents were reported in Jefferson County on Friday morning. \nAccidents were scattered throughout the area, MoDOT says, but the Lemay and Reavis Barracks area in South County has seen the worst of the icy weather.

District maintenance engineer Mark Croarkin says that means it is starting to spread onto actual roadways. \nThe best tip the highway patrol gives to drivers is to first of all, stay home, but if you have to drive, drive slow. \n(TM and Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
