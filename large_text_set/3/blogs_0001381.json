Lenehan in finding Bassam Al-Rawi not guilty on Wednesday of sexually assaulting the woman in May 2015.\nA police officer found the woman “naked from the breasts down” in the back seat of Al-Rawi’s cab, according to court transcripts from the March 1 ruling. \nShe was extremely intoxicated and in and out of consciousness. The officer said Al-Rawi’s pants were down and he was holding the woman’s urine-soaked tights and underwear.\nThe complainant, whose identity is protected by a publication ban, told local media she has no recollection of the event. \nBut Lenehan said while she may have been unable to consent when she was found by the officer, it’s unclear whether she was able to consent at the start of the encounter in the cab. \nHe said that someone “who is unconscious or is so intoxicated … as to be incapable of understanding or perceiving the situation that presents itself” cannot provide consent under Canadian law.\n“This does not mean, however, that an intoxicated person cannot give consent to sexual activity,” Lenehan said. “Clearly a drunk can consent.”\nThe complainant’s blood alcohol level was between 223 and 244 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and an expert testified this would mean she was drunk enough to both forget events and lose track of her surroundings. \nHer DNA was also found on Al-Rawi’s upper lip, but the judge suggested there were reasonable means other than assault by which it might have gotten there, perhaps because Al-Rawi “absent-mindedly” wiped his upper lip after handling her urine-soaked pants. \n“The Crown failed to produce any evidence of lack of consent at any time when Mr. Al-Rawi was touching” the complainant, the judge ruled. “A lack of memory does not equate to a lack of consent.”\nThe judge’s language suggesting someone that intoxicated can consent has prompted sexual violence experts to question the ruling. \n“I think we should be concerned when a trial judge in a sexual assault case refers to a complainant as ‘a drunk’,” said Elaine Craig, an associate professor of law at Dalhousie University. The Criminal Code says sexual contact is assault when someone “is incapable of consenting to the activity.”\nCraig said that doesn’t mean someone needs to be passed out. \n“You can’t consent if you lack capacity and to equate incapacity with unconsciousness is wrong. Lack of capacity presumably begins at some point prior to unconsciousness,” she said. \nCraig is among the legal experts who called for an inquiry into Justice Robin Camp, who asked a sexual assault complainant why she couldn’t keep her “knees together” and said “sex and pain sometimes go together.” \nCraig said this case is just another among many recent examples that speak to why many people would like to see sexual assault judgments delivered in written format. It’s something Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose is calling for in a private member’s bill she has presented in the House. \nFarrah Khan, co-ordinator of Ryerson University’s office of sexual violence support and education, said we “individualize” the Camp situation, when there are rulings such as this across the country on a regular basis. She said all too often, whether it’s police or judges or lawyers, intoxication is used to discredit complainants, even when there’s evidence an assault occurred. \n“Drinking doesn’t cause sexual assault, rapists do,” Khan said. \nLenehan was previously the subject of controversy when he ordered a mother to stop breastfeeding her four-month-old in his courtroom in 2015. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T19:55:47.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
