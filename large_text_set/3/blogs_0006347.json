In response to the decision, hundreds of Egypt’s poorest citizens filled the streets in the cities of Alexandria and Giza, and the towns of Kafr el-Sheikh and Minya. Roads were blocked and residentssurrounded government buildings. \nOne protest in Alexandria showed people chanting “we want bread” and “everything but a loaf”, according to video footage taken by protesters. The hashtag “supply uprising” trended on Twitter across Egypt on Tuesday. \nThe protests come as the cost of living for the average Egyptian rises rapidly. Egypt devalued its currency and cut fuel subsidies in November, prompting the value of the Egyptian pound to halve and leading to long lines of furious citizens at petrol stations. \nThe cuts are intended to overhaul Egypt’s moribund economy in order to receive a $12bn loan from the International Monetary Fund. \nBut bread subsidies are considered as a red line among the Egyptian public, a staple on the plate of every family from richest to poorest.

The government, under president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, defended the cut to bread subsidies as a necessary step to fight corruption within the system, and stressed it would likely affect bakeries, not individuals. \n“[We] will not touch the share of bread for citizens under any circumstances,” the minister of supply, Ali Moselhy, told a press conference on Tuesday. The governor of Alexandria, the city at the heart of the protests, later increased the supply of loaves to 2000 per bakery eligible for subsidies. \nTimothy E Kaldas, an analyst with the Washington-based thinktank the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy , said the IMF deal does not include a reduction to subsidies of food. \nKaldas said such cuts may be necessary to fight rampant corruption in Egypt’s wheat industry, but that the government failed to properly explain the move. “The problem is that they offered no information and then left people to make their own conclusions,” he said. \nThe Arab world’s most populous nation has witnessed frequent outbursts of anger against the rising living costs since an economic crisis engulfed the country in 2016. Last October, a taxi driver self-immolated in Alexandria after accusing government officials of being responsible for heightened living costs. \nTwo days earlier, a video of an unnamed tuk-tuk driver ranting about the economy went viral: “On television, we see a picture of Egypt that’s like Vienna – but when we get out into the street we see a cousin of Somalia … the poor citizen can’t find one kilogram of rice on the street,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:41:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
