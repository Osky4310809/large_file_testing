The leak does, however, offer some further details on the cameras. The 12MP rear-shooter is said to use 1.4μm pixels with an F/1.7 aperture and a presumed optical image stabilizer, while the 8MP front-facing lens adds autofocus to its repertoire. We also have additional confirmation that the battery of the S8 is going to be 3000mAh, though the battery capacity of the S8+ is still unknown, though speculated to be 3,500mAh.\nCredit: WinFuture.de \nApart from the raw specification sheet, we also have information about some of the software features on the new devices. The iris scanner is mentioned briefly, noting the ability of this component to lock certain apps or folders within the device. Also on the topic of biometrics, the fingerprint scanner will reportedly also be used for gestures such as opening and closing apps.\nOverall, no huge revelations have been made here, but rather further confirmation of previously reported specifications and configurations. Still missing (though not for long) is the confirmed storage sizes for each respective region, as well as confirmation that only battery and screen size separate the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Looks like we’ll have to wait two more agonizing days for any such relief.\nAll images, including feature, credited to Winfuture.de \nSource: Winfuture.de ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T16:11:32.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
