car fuses electric power with luxury styling mar 09, 2017 pininfarina H600 concept car fuses electric power with luxury styling \nthe ‘H600′ electric concept car , made by pininfarina in collaboration with hybrid kinetic group, makes its world debut at the geneva motor show 2017 . the futuristic concept vehicle is built with people who appreciate refined details, precious materials and exclusive treatments, in mind. the international and cosmopolitan approach expresses values approved of in hong kong as they are in shanghai, new york or milan. the ‘H600′ aims to be a solution to today’s’ sustainable mobility imperatives, displaying a formal balance between elegance and eye-catching aesthetics, embodying the concepts of luxury and exclusivity. the ‘H600′ looks to open up a new horizon and infinite prospects for the booming new energy vehicle industry. \n\nthe luxury sports sedan is one of the archetypes created by pininfarina , where the ‘H600’s’ most authentic design themes find their fullest expression: harmonious proportions, taut lines, flowing surfaces and a clear-cut stripe that runs along the length of the sides and exalts the dynamic stance of the vehicle. the marks on the warm grey metallic body emphasize the variegated reflections of the light and call attention to a number of details, like jeweled insets, such as the polished aluminum inserts arranged in a line that starts at the bonnet, runs along the waistline and embraces the rear section, reflecting the degree of finish typically associated with premium segment cars. \n\nthe rear lights compose a luminous stripe radiating progressively from the logo towards the exterior. the glazed surface of the roof has been designed with a view to ensuring the ideal balance between the need to protect the occupants and the possibility of letting in the light and seeing outside. at night, the window becomes a luminous porthole supplying artificial light to the cockpit. the interior of the ‘H600′ follows the layout of a lounge, an open space that ensures maximum comfort for the rear seat passengers thanks to a higher degree of spaciousness and habitability than is normally found in this segment. \n\nt he surfaces are covered with noble materials such as natural leather having haute couture formal quality and finishes, with copper colored seams contrasting with the cocoa brown upholstery. extensive use of veneered wood on the seat shells and the floor, with an artful use of the wood grain, harks back to the tradition of cabinet-making. for an even more exclusive interior, a clock is set in the center control panel, right under the central lid. \n\nambient lights take the form of white luminous bands that fill the interior with a suffused light, creating a natural and pleasing atmosphere and a sensation of psychological well-being. the human machine interface elements inside the car work at different levels, with a big screen that cuts across the facia and calls to mind a suspended cabinet. thus, the various zones are well identified: the driver side with controls and gauges, and, on the passenger side, a comfortable zone for the passenger with the infotainment system. \n\nin the center, a large touch pad makes it possible to control all vehicle functions. two screens on the back of the front seats ensure entertainment for the rear seat passengers. the next-gen hk powertrain technology, comprising battery, electric motors, electrical controller and range extender, is the other key feature making the futuristing concept vehicle stand out. range limitation is no longer an issue thanks to the combination of a HK micro turbine generator range extender, and a HK super battery, empowering the ‘H600′ with ultra-mileage and a long driving range. the hk micro turbine generator range extender can provide electric power for the motor and the battery anytime, anywhere, and with no need for charging pits and social grids. unlike traditional new energy vehicles, the ‘H600′ also comes equipped with an energy recycling system that can greatly improve energy efficiency, and contribute to the mission of sustainable development.", "external_links": [],
