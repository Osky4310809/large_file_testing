Black man with red bandana robbed a gas station as I was in the studio working but I'm in handcuffs?\" \nIt was actually deputies with the West Hollywood division of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department who stopped Jean. LAPD confirmed their officers were not involved. It is unclear who took the video posted to Twitter. Jean has more than 4.2 million followers. \nJean blasted the sheriff's department for his treatment. \n\"I was asked by the police to put my hands up. Then I was told do not move. I was instantly hand cuffed before being asked to identify myself,\" Jean tweeted in an additional post. \"As some one who has law enforcers in my family, I was appalled by this behavior of the LAPD.\" \nThe Hollywood Reporter attempted to reach the watch commander at the West Hollywood sheriff's station, but after being placed on hold for almost 20 minutes, the line was disconnected.
