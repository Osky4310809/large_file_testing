The ethics change, which prompted an outcry from Democrats and government watchdog groups, is part of a rules package that the full House will vote on Tuesday. The package also includes a means for Republican leaders to punish lawmakers if there is a repeat of the Democratic sit-in last summer over gun control. Under the ethics change pushed by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., the non-partisan Office of Congressional Ethics would fall under the control of the House Ethics Committee, which is run by lawmakers. It would be known as the Office of Congressional Complaint Review, and the rule change would require that \"any matter that may involve a violation of criminal law must be referred to the Committee on Ethics for potential referral to law enforcement agencies after an affirmative vote by the members,\" according to Goodlatte's office. Lawmakers would have the final say under the change. House Republicans voted 119-74 for the Goodlatte measure despite arguments from Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., against the change. They failed to sway rank-and-file Republicans, some of whom have felt unfairly targeted by the OCE. \"The amendment builds upon and strengthens the existing Office of Congressional Ethics by maintaining its primary area of focus of accepting and reviewing complaints from the public and referring them, if appropriate, to the Committee on Ethics,\" Goodlatte said in a statement. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Democrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, reacted angrily. \"Republicans claim they want to 'drain the swamp,' but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions,\" the California lawmaker said in a statement. \"Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.\" Chris Carson, president of the League of Women Voters, said Ryan should be ashamed of himself and his leadership team. \"We all know the so-called House Ethics Committee is worthless for anything other than a whitewash — sweeping corruption under the rug. That's why the independent Office of Congressional Ethics has been so important. The OCE works to stop corruption and that's why Speaker Ryan is cutting its authority. Speaker Ryan is giving a green light to congressional corruption.\" The OCE was created in March 2008 after the cases of former Rep. Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham, R-Calif., who served more than seven years in prison on bribery and other charges; as well as cases of former Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, who was charged in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal and pleaded guilty to corruption charges and former Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., convicted on corruption in a separate case. ___ AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report. ___ The name of the office in this story has been corrected to the Office of Congressional Ethics, rather than the Office of Government Ethics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:54:32.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
