Xiaomi Redmi Pro 2 to reportedly feature Helio P25 SoC and dual 12MP cameras By - March 14, 2017 “A new leak suggests that the Redmi Pro 2 will be driven by a MediaTek Helio P25 SoC” \nRecently, reports surrounding a new Xiaomi smartphone and its specs surfaced on the interwebs. As per the leak , the smartphone in question was the Xiaomi Redmi Pro 2 and it was allegedly powered by a Snapdragon 660 processor. However, a new leak suggests that the Redmi Pro 2 will be driven by the MediaTek Helio P25 SoC instead. The Helio P25 SoC powering the smartphone is said to have an octa-core CPU that consists of four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at up to 2.5GHz and another four at 1.6GHz. Graphics will supposedly be handled by the Mali-T880MP4 GPU. The leak further states that the Xiaomi Redmi Pro 2 will follow in the footsteps of its predecessor and should feature a 12MP dual-camera setup at the back along with a unibody metal design. There will be two versions of the smartphone up for grabs – one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, the other sporting 6GB and 128GB, respectively. While there is no date set in stone, Xiaomi is expected to lift the curtains of the Redmi Pro 2 by the end of this month. The 4GB RAM variant of the smartphone will allegedly be priced at CNY 1,599 (~Rs 15,302) while the 6GB RAM variant should carry a price tag of CNY 1,799 (~Rs 17,216).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T13:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T09:44:24.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
