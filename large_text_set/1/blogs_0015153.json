He is one of our go-to gurus when we‚Äôre stuck for a fierce makeup look and he never disappoints. His talent and confidence is oozing and when his father wrote a letter is support of Manny MUA after he was shamed on Twitter , we fell in love with his dad, too.\nTweets flooded in to Manny MUAs account in support of his new position as an ambassador for one of the big makeup companies, but of course, conservative blogger, Matt Walsh, had to insert his input, which we feel was completely uncalled for.\nDads, this is why you need to be there to raise your sons. pic.twitter.com/8ybirgppKi \n‚Äî Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) January 6, 2017 His fans jumped on that tweet, telling Wash that he was out of line.\nManny stood up for himself, too, sharing his reply to Walsh on Instagram replying that his dad IS proud of him, and all that‚Äôs he‚Äôs accomplished, and that his dad works for his company.
