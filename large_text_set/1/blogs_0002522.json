In a statement confirming her departure, Rupert Murdoch was positive, if succinct.\n“We thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to Fox News. We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family all the best.”\nFox agreed to let Kelly agreed anchor her program for the remainder of the week, scheduling her last show for Jan. 6. Greta Van Susteren, who left last year, by contrast, was out at the channel the same day she gave notice to network executives.\nNow, Fox News needs to chart its course in primetime. Sean Hannity's ratings are on the rise at 10 p.m. -- following the election of his friend, President-elect Donald Trump -- while 8 p.m. host Bill O’Reilly is still debating whether he stays, or follows Kelly out the door when his contract is up this summer.\nDespite the turmoil of the past year and the rotating cast of hosts, Fox’s ratings appear unaffected. If anything, Trump's election has given them a jolt. Tucker Carlson, who ultimately succeeded Van Susteren at 7 p.m. (Brit Hume filled in as guest host in the immediate aftermath of her departure), has not only kept her audience, but improved on those numbers. And Hannity has done well in recent months, serving as arguably the most Trump-friendly show on TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:34:14.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
