In the immediate aftermath of the vote, which prompted fury among Israeli authorities, Netanyahu recalled Israel’s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal for consultations. \nIn the run-up to the landmark vote, Netanyahu took a belligerent tone, calling the resolution a “declaration of war” as he asked New Zealand’s foreign minister to withdraw support from the document. \nREAD MORE: 'Stop Israelis from these crimes’: Palestine demands international action over settlements law \n“If you continue to promote this resolution, from our point of view it will be a declaration of war. It will rupture the relations and there will be consequences,” the Israeli leader allegedly warned Murray McCully over the telephone. \nEgypt, which initially presented the resolution on behalf of Palestine, pulled out of sponsoring the draft after Egyptian President Abdel Sisi reportedly was pressured to do so by Netanyahu.

Several planned meetings with top officials from China, the UK and Ukraine were canceled. \nIn retaliation against Senegal, Israel also canceled all its foreign aid programs in the country. \nHowever, since then Netanyahu appeared to soften his stance. Last week, he flew to the UK for a meeting with the British PM Theresa May, although London was among those who backed the resolution. \nWhile no official comment on the issue has been provided by Netanyahu’s office, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said “no decision to downgrade diplomatic relations with Senegal and New Zealand” is on the table.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:19:54.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
