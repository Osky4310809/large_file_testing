Erdogan and his government have promoted a series off rallies in Germany — as well as the Netherlands — to support his cause among the Turkish population abroad. 1.4 million Turks in Germany are eligible to vote. © REUTERS/ Dylan Martinez Demonstrators clash with riot police during running battles in the streets near the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam, Netherlands March 12, 2017. \nHowever, German authorities have canceled a number of rallies , fearing violence and a rise in anti-migrant sentiment.

The comparison is monstrous and denigrates the suffering of the victims of the Shoah,\" Schuster said. © REUTERS/ Murad Sezer A campaign banner for the upcoming referendum with the picture of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is seen on Taksim square in central Istanbul, Turkey March 15, 2017. \nThe row comes on the back of previous outburst by Erdogan, early March, when he accused the German authorities of using \"Nazi tactics\" to stop rallies in tended to support Erdogan's proposals. \"It cannot be justified.
