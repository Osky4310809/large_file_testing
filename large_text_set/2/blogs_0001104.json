Once we watched it, we new why. And we didn’t know how we’d survive without more information. Well, details about the upcoming second season have been revealed, and we hope we’ll get answers to some of our lingering questions .\nNew episodes of the documentary series about Steven Avery, imprisoned under possibly corrupt circumstances, should hit Netflix by the end of 2017! A spokesperson for Netflix told People that “we have no launch date set as of yet,” but she expects the new episodes to be released late in the year.\nNetflix Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi, Making a Murderer creators, are currently filming the second season. “Laura and Moira are shooting regularly and working on what the right story is to tell in the next set, so we’re deferring to them on when it will be ready,” Netflix VP Cindy Holland told USA Today .\nCongrats to #MakingAMurderer on four #Emmy wins including outstanding documentary series. pic.twitter.com/9ayPwHaFkS \n— Making A Murderer (@MakingAMurderer) September 12, 2016 We can barely stomach the mere idea of what they might be learning about Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey’s cases.\nAnd are they in communication with our mega lawyer crushes , Dean Strang and Jerry Buting? Absolutely loved hearing these babes talk about all my fave criminal justice issues last night #Makingamurderer #deanandjerry #freestevenavery OBVS \nA photo posted by Alexandra Sutherland (@alexandrasuds) on Jan 28, 2017 at 11:12am PST \nIt seems the folks at Netflix don’t even know for sure.\n“Very few people inside of Netflix actually know the details of what we’re getting because we’re wanting to keep it really under wraps and it is an ongoing case so we’re trying to be sensitive to that,” Holland said.\nOkay. We’ll try not to gnaw our nails to the quick in anticipation. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:07:59.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
