The prime minister did not host anyone at Chequers. \nIn the last quarter of the year, May received hospitality from three media organisations at awards ceremonies – the Sun, Spectator and Trinity Mirror group. \nShe had meetings with a number of other newspaper editors, including John Witherow, of the Times, and Chris Evans, of the Daily Telegraph, but Dacre was the only one to get the honour of a dinner in Downing Street between July and December last year. \nMay also recorded a meeting with the former prime minister Tony Blair in November to discuss his former role as Middle East peace envoy . \nThe prime minister was given a raft of gifts held by the department, but purchased two pieces that she wished to keep in line with the ministerial code: a £225 piece of clothing from Lady Jubie Wigan and a £344 piece of jewellery from Nadja Swarovski.
