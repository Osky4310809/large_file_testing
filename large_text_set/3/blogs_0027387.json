Really, it's a second chance at retail months after the original launch. But, it's also a way for patient consumers to get everything at once with a considerable price break.\nSomewhat bafflingly, ReCore  -- a game with no released DLC -- is going to get a Definitive Edition. That news comes from a German ratings board leak . At the time of writing, the listing has been removed.\nMicrosoft has been teasing additional ReCore  content for half a year now. We first reported on it shortly after its September launch when a Microsoft representative confirmed to us that the game's fifth robot was missing but that we should \"stay tuned for news.\" Since then, developer Armature released a trailer to detail how the Tank robot functions.\nThe problem is that the Tank was very obviously stripped from the base game in a hasty and sloppy way. There's an entire area that's locked off because it requires the Tank's ability to maneuver over quicksand. There's space in the menus for a robot that would never show up. Enemies even drop parts to upgrade the Tank, so the player gathers a bunch of components that are ultimately useless.\nThe Tank DLC hasn't even been officially announced. So, to anyone unaware of its existence, this Definitive Edition just seems like a collection of patches and updates that automatically download upon launching the game. It's a strange situation, mostly because Microsoft hasn't controlled the messaging.\nExpect Microsoft to address it soon, though. There are too many lingering questions -- the biggest one being \"Will prior owners get this add-on for free?\" The allure of Definitive Editions is that it feels like buying a surplus of content; with ReCore , it'll feel like the game finally getting to how it should've shipped in the first place.\nReCore Definitive Edition coming soon [NeoGAF]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T07:08:49.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
