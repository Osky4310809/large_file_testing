It seems like Apple might have inadvertently teased support for a newer iPad within the code for this particular update. The discovery was made by developer Steve Troughton-Smith. In his tweet, Troughton-Smith hinted that the refresh rate of a 2017 iOS device could go higher than 60Hz. \nWhile he didn’t specifically mention the 10.5-inch iPad here, a report published recently seems to corroborate the existence of a 10.5-inch iPad Pro. The code mentioned here talks about how Apple will allow developers to run their apps in varying refresh rates. So is it possible that Apple is looking to revamp the iPad lineup yet again with a low-cost and a high-end model, respectively? One can’t be too sure at this point, although this new revelation certainly points in that direction. \nIt is important to note that Apple already has a 9.7-inch iPad Pro in the lineup, which has already sparked off some confusion. So to add yet another variant with a 10.5-inch display will surely add to that. Assuming this model will belong to the iPad Pro lineup, Apple will effectively have three iPad Pro models. \nAs for the upping of the screen refresh rate, it seems like Apple was contemplating this all along. The Apple Pencil offers a refresh rate of 240Hz with the iPad Pro, even though the display isn’t capable of keeping up with the refresh rate. So it was only a matter of time before Apple made the adjustment. \nWith Apple launching the low-cost iPad just a day ago, it will be interesting to see where this particular model will fit in. If you’re still confused about the differences between the 9.7-inch iPad and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, this post should help you understand .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:05:40.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
