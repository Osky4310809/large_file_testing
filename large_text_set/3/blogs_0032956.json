I had to see this. You have to see it now too. It’s like The Ring . I’m sorry. \nWait. \nYep. That is in fact the rare three-toed slob. And obviously this is a situation where there are no winners. Even the woman arguing with the big gal seemed to lose her will to live after she pulled that monstrosity she calls a foot out. I don’t know that it made her “win” the argument but it certainly helped it reach a faster conclusion. In that respect, I appreciate her monstrous hoof. No fist fighting, no racial epithets, just a big gal who tries to end situations with a diabetes foot and zero shame. I honestly think that her and Leland Scoots could fall in love despite his “Fuck yo toe” attitude. It’s a thin line between love and hate and with emotions that high, I could definitely see a need for some tension to be released. All I’m saying: Keep an open mind you two. You’re not so different after all. Chris Spags |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:27:28.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
