USA TODAY Sports Green Bay Packers running back Eddie Lacy runs for a first down against New York Giants defender Andrew Adams in the second quarter at Lambeau Field. (Photo: Dan Powers, USA TODAY Sports) 468 CONNECT 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Seattle Seahawks have found their veteran addition to the backfield. \nRunning back Eddie Lacy agreed to a one-year deal with the team on Tuesday, his agency confirmed on Twitter. A person familiar with the contract, who asked to remain anonymous since financial terms of the deal had not been released, told USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero that it was for $5.55 million with $3 million guaranteed. \nLacy, 26, played in just five games for the Green Bay Packers last season before he was shelved by an ankle injury. Packers coach Mike McCarthy also criticized Lacy for his weight after the 2015 season in which he ran for just 758 yards. But in his first two years in Green Bay he ran for a combined 2,317 yards and 20 touchdowns, making the Pro Bowl as a rookie in 2013. \nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll said Lacy's target weight would be in the 240-pound range. \n\"There will be a real concerted effort to make sure he's at his best,\" Carroll said of Lacy's conditioning. \nIn Seattle, Lacy will be expected to boost a running attack that ranked just 25th in the NFL last season. \nRunning backs Thomas Rawls and C.J. Prosise return next season, but the Seahawks demonstrated an interest in adding an established back prior to Lacy's signing. Seattle hosted Adrian Peterson on Monday and was set to meet with Jamaal Charles later in the week. \nCarroll said the Seahawks' running game would be a one-two punch with Lacy and Rawls. \nPHOTOS: Notable NFL players on the move Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
