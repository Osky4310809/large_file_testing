On Monday, the actor shared a photo of himself snuggled up in bed with his two beautiful daughters, Ella and Grace . In addition to the cute snap, Mark wrote, \"Took my girls on a daddy-daughter bonding weekend. #family\" The sweet moment comes less than a month after Mark hinted that Justin Bieber came over to his house and had Ella in a tizzy. \"She said, 'Dad, that's going to be my husband,' and I said, 'Over my dead body.' Actually, over their dead bodies. I'll just go back to jail,\" he joked. Sadly, we don't think Justin joined them this time around.
