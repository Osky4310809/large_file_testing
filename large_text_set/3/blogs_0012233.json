What can possibly go wrong? (Photo: YouTube/GCAFCOfficial) \nAll that was left was for Ainge to pull the trigger and wheel away in delight. \nHe managed the first bit, hitting the ball with power... and then watched as it flew out of the ground and entered the atmosphere. \nNow, Ainge could have taken the miss to heart and retreated into the safety of his own half, but a minute later he made up for his error with a great goal to put his team ahead. The last time the ball was ever seen (Photo: YouTube/GCAFCOfficial) \nUnfortunately his heroics weren't quite enough to secure the tie however, and Gloucester City pegged back Harrogate a whole minute later. \nAh well, a day to forget and remember for Ainge, eh?
