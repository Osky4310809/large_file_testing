Five possible fights after his shock win over David Haye Bellew pulled off one of the great shocks in British boxing history and has a whole host of options ahead Share By Jack Rathborn Martin Domin 00:34, 5 MAR 2017 Tony Bellew celebrates defeating David Haye (Photo: REUTERS) Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nTony Bellew delivered one of the greatest shocks in British boxing history to defeat David Haye . \nThe Bomber came on strong after the Hayemaker injured himself in the sixth round and knocked his opponent through the ropes in the 11th round before trainer Shane McGuigan chucked the towel in. \nThe rematch is one option, but there is plenty more besides. Let's take a look at what's next for, in the man's own words, 'the champion of misfits.'

If Bellew is all about securing his family future, the rematch is the way to go. \nAnd given the unfortunate nature of Haye's demise in this fight, plus his good grace afterwards, it would be refreshing to see it happen for a second time.

I have one more night left,\" Bellew remarked after the fight. \nWilder appears to be hiding some glass on his chin and looked technically poor in his last outing, so this is understandably a great option for Bellew: high reward but potentially an easier route to victory than against a recovered Haye.

Huck, meanwhile, ruled the 200lb division for six years before losing to Krzysztof Glowacki in 2015. \nSubsequent victories over Ola Afolabi and Dmytro Kucher have put him back in world title contention.

Murat Gassiev \nIt's unlikely that the WBC would allow Bellew another exemption but if Briedis or Huck need a lengthy time out, they might allow a unification clash in the meantime. \nGassiev has won all 24 of his bouts on his way to picking up the IBF strap, knocking out 17. The Russian could probably be tempted over to the UK to give Bellew another night in front of his own fans. (Photo: Anadolu) Retirement? \nBellew admitted he doesn't want to do this forever after victory over Haye. But the scouser did claim he has 'one fight left in me' - at least, presumably. \nThe cash will probably prove too much to resist, but Bellew could never go out on a greater high than this - but then you would have said the same after his victory at Goodison Park against Ilunga Makabu. poll loading Will Tony Bellew give David Haye a rematch? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:48:38.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
