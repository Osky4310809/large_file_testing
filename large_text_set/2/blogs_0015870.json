He was stiff and his hands were noisy when I saw him in the fall, though his contact is hard when he’s making it. Regardless of his defensive home, he’s going to have to hit more than he has. He led his level in strikeouts last year, and I have inconsistent reports on the bat path and bat speed. \nGuillermo Zuniga , RHP – This Colombian righty was a bit older than other members of the ’16-17 July 2 class (he turned 18 in October), but he’s got a good pitcher’s body at 6-foot-3, 195, an easy, repeatable delivery and solid curveball feel. His fastball, 88-92, touching 93, jumps on hitters due to extension, and he’s shown an ability to back door his curveball already. He’ll probably carve up the GCL this year, because he can throw that breaking ball for strikes. \nAbrahan Gutierrez , C – Gutierrez was one of the bigger names in Atlanta’s J2 class because his body matured sooner than his peers’. He lost some mobility as signing day approached, but he has enough defensive skill to remain at catcher long term provided he keeps his body in check and remain mobile. He turned 17 in October. Gutierrez has average raw arm strength that plays down because of how long it take Gutierrez to rise from his crouch, but that should be cleaned up, at least a bit, with instruction. Offensively, he has some pull power because of raw strength in his hands, but he lacks exceptional bat speed. He may never be more than a 40 hitter with 45 game power. If he can catch, however, that will play. \nYenci Pena , 3B – Pena has a big frame and above-average power projection. As he grows into that power, he’ll almost certainly move off of short and to third base. The actions, footwork and arm strength will play there, possibly as plus. He’s a high-upside lottery ticket. \nJesse Biddle , LHP – Fate has been unkind to Biddle. A former first-round pick by Philadelphia, Biddle was 88-94 with a loopy but cool-looking 69-72 mph curveball for much of his tenure with Philly before the curveball ceased to be effective with heavy use against upper-level hitters (often the case for lollipop curveballs like Biddle’s). He struggled with command which made it difficult for him to work more heavily with and develop a slider (which looked promising when he would throw it) and changeup. A freakish run of bad luck (the most bizarre occurrence was Biddle getting hit in the head with a tennis-ball-size chunk of hail and suffering a concussion early in 2014, the most severe one was he needed Tommy John in the fall of 2015) totally derailed his career, and he was DFA’d by Philly and Pittsburgh before landing with the Braves. \nLivan Soto , INF – Soto, signed out of Venezuela for $1 million, has a lot of physical projection and has shown some solid hitting traits, but he’s extremely raw both physically and technically. Until Soto fills out, if he does at all, it’s hard to say which of his tools will have benefited from physical maturation (bat control, power and arm strength are likely candidates) and which have been harmed (straight-line speed and already heavy defensive footwork). He’ll likely end up at third base eventually. \nLucas Sims , RHP, 1.8 KATOH+ – Sims will sit 94-96 with a plus curveball, but the fastball plays down due to its flat, lifeless nature. Sims’ delivery is a bit stiff and oddly paced, resulting in 30 control. He needs to improve his ability to throw strikes just to be a middle-relief piece, and there’s a chance he never gets there. \nJacob Lindgren , LHP – Lindgren was 87-90 as a sophomore starter at Mississippi State, then touching 96 as a junior out of the bullpen with a plus-plus slider. He struck out 100 hitters in 55 innings of relief as a junior and the Yankees picked him in the second round of the 2014 draft. He reached the majors in his first pro season, but his slider’s bite became very inconsistent. He missed much of 2016 with bone spurs in and then had Tommy John in August. The Yankees non-tendered him in December and Atlanta offered him a major-league deal. He only began throwing a few weeks ago. \nAkeel Morris , RHP, 0.9 KATOH+ – Morris was touching 95 in the Fall League, sitting mostly 92-94 with a plus changeup that has extreme velocity separation from his heater, usually tumbling in in the upper-70s. His delivery has a lot of moving parts and he has poor control. At age 24, he’s looking more like an up-and-down arm than a true middle-relief mainstay because the command is so unreliable. \nJosh Graham , RHP – Graham began his career at Oregon as a catcher and, after two years behind the plate, moved to the mound. He’s built like a catcher and has a stiff, somewhat slingy delivery that he struggles to repeat. He’s a pure relief prospect but sits 92-95 and touches 97 while flashing a plus changeup. The breaking ball is fringey, but the fastball/change combination could allow him to be a bullpen mainstay. \nThomas Burrows , LHP – Burrows was the Mariners’ fourth-round pick out of Alabama from the 2016 draft and then was traded to Atlanta in the Mallex Smith , Drew Smyly kerfuffle. He’s a low-slot, pure relief arm with an average fastball/slider combo that could play a half-grade above that due to natural deception in Burrows’ delivery. He profiles as a lefty specialist. \nJeremy Walker , RHP – Atlanta’s fifth rounder out of Gardner Webb, Walker was 91-94 for me during instructional league with a stiff, relief-only delivery. He flashed two different above-average breaking balls in a tight, Frisbee-like mid-80s slider that touched 88 and an upper-70s, two-plane curveball. He’s a potential middle-relief piece. \nEvan Phillips , RHP, 0.7 KATOH+ – Phillips was 94-97 in the Fall Stars game with a fringe change and average slider in the 82-84 range that had some length but lacked sharp movement. I like the velo but don’t see a bat-missing secondary offering here. Still, the three-pitch mix may work in middle relief. \nLuis Mora , RHP – Mora is 21 but still freakishly skinny. His limbs look like Twizzlers and he’s had trouble holding his stuff late into starts. It sounds like Atlanta is considering developing him in a multi-inning relief role. That might allow Mora to sit 95-plus with his fastball for the duration of his outings. He was touching 101 last year. Mora’s seccondaries are very inconsistent, at times flashing above average but often sputtering in well below average. He throws from a lower slot, and it’s hard for him to get on top of a breaking ball from that angle, so if any of his pitches are going to improve enough to make him a viable big leaguer, I think it’s likely to be his changeup \nJuan Contreras , RHP – Contreras touches 97 with his fastball and sits 92-95. There’s some effort to the delivery, but Contreras’s lower half is long and strong and the arm works fine. His best secondary is a slider with purely vertical movement, a result of Contreras’ vertical arm slot. It flashes plus. It’s hard to generate any changeup movement from a slot like Contreras’. Due to a combination of that arm slot, his size (a slightly built 6-foot-1) and the effort in his delivery, there’s a good chance he’s only a reliever. \nAnthony Guardado , RHP – Guardado suffered a shoulder injury playing quarterback in high school and didn’t pitch much as a senior. I ran into him purely by chance when I went to see San Dimas righty Pete Lambert (now with Colorado) during their draft springs and Guardado was touching 94 with curveball feel over just two innings of work. The injury issues have lingered in pro ball, which is why Guardado hasn’t thrown very many innings, and it’s difficult to know what’s still in there. \nCorbin Clouse , LHP – Clouse was a 27th rounder in 2016 out of Davenport University. A back injury required a medical redshirt during his freshman year, but he struck out 75 hitters over 50 innings as a redshirt sophomore. He was 90-93, touching 95, and flashing a 55 slider out of Rome’s bullpen last year and is a potential middle-relief piece. \nLuis Ovando , 2B – A Dominican second baseman signed later during the 2015 J2 period, Ovando fits best defensively at second base rather than short and he has an advanced feel to hit. \nTucker Davidson , LHP – A 19th rounder out of Midland JC in Texas, Davidson was topping out at 93 in college, but his velo has ticked up as he’s improved his conditioning and is now touching 96. He might breakout this year. \nJohan Camargo , INF, o.7 KATOH+- A switch-hitting Panamanian infielder, Camargo will flash impressive leatherwork, but he lacks the range for shortstop and the bat to play anywhere else. His feel for hitting and lack of balance at the plate are both non-starters for any sort of offensive output, but he’s a plus defender at third and has started to see reps at second base. He could have Abraham Nunez ’ career. \nMicah Johnson , 2B, 1.8 KATOH+ – Johnson turned 26 in December and still doesn’t have the power to play at any defensive position he’s capable of competently manning regular basis. The Dodgers had him working at various positions in Triple-A last year, but he can’t play shortstop, so it’s not an obvious utility profile. He can absolutely fly and hits right-handed pitching a little bit, so if he can develop enough feel for center field to be passable there, then he could essentially be a fourth outfielder who can also play second base. \nBraulio Vasquez , SS – One of Atlanta’s lesser-heralded signings from the 2016 J2 class, Vasquez is a 55 runner with viable actions at shortstop and some feel to hit, but he was seen as too weak with the bat to be more than a utility player at maturity. Then he showed up to camp this week having added 15 pounds. This is one to monitor in the GCL this year. \nAnfernee Seymour , SS – Seymour was born in the Bahamas but went to high school at the fabled American Heritage in Florida. He was the Marlins’ seventh rounder in 2014 and then traded to Atlanta in the Hunter Cervenka deal last year. He’ll likely never hit enough to be a regular (below-average bat speed and raw feel to hit) and profiles more as a utility player, though he might be able to play above-average defense at all the premium positions, as he’s an 80 runner with enough athleticism to pass at both middle-infield spots. \nRamon Morla , RHP – A former Seattle farmhand who moved to the mound after a disappointing start to his career with the bat, Morla was touching 99 with a plus slider in the AZL before his elbow blew out. His body and stuff had gone a bit backward when he returned, and he signed a minor-league deal with Atlanta this offseason. He’s an interesting flier if he can reclaim all of his arm strength. \nIzzy Wilson , OF – Signed during the 2014 July 2 period off of the island of St. Martin (an island about 200 miles east of Puerto Rico that’s split in half by the French and Dutch), Wilson is a tools goof without any modicum of polish in the batter’s box. He’s a twitchy and well-built (6’3, 185) plus runner with above-average raw power and plus bat speed, but his bat control is way behind and needs significant polish if he’s even going to be a bench outfielder. \nWilliam Contreras , C – The brother of Cubs catcher Willson Contreras , William is also a malleable athlete with some feel to catch, bat speed and mobility skills. He’s just raw. \nLucas Herbert , C, 0.4 KATOH+ – Herbert has always been a glove-first prospect and he remains so, but the bat hasn’t progressed to a point of viability and it’s becoming increasingly unlikely that it ever will. \nPhil Pfeifer , LHP — An undersized lefty from Vanderbilt, Pfiefer sits in the low-90s, will touch 94, and has a four-pitch mix headlined by an above-average slider. He’s had stamina issues, and his future is the the bullpen as a unique deep repertoire mop-up guy. \nCarlos Castro , 1B, 0.4 KATOH+ – Castro has plus raw power but swings at (almost literally) everything and has a first-base-only defensive profile. He takes huge, aggressive hacks and annihilates mistakes on the inner half, but his approach needs to improve quickly and drastically. \nDevan Watts , RHP – A 17th rounder in 2016, Watts sits 91-94 with some downhill plane and an average slider. He attacks hitters, throws strikes and is another potential ‘pen arm who lacks the raw stuff of the names ahead of him on the list. \nJuan Yepez , INF – Yepez began the season in Low-A as an 18-year-old but suffered an oblique injury, missed three months and his season never got off the ground. He has above-average raw power but also expands the zone too often. Scouts are split on whether he fits long term at third base or first. The latter would force a significant improvement in approach if he’s to remain a prospect. \nJean Carlos Encarnacion , INF – A Dominican infielder who signed for just $10,000, Encarnacion has begun to grow into his lanky 6-foot-3 frame and flash above-average power. He was a little old for the DSL last year but is worth monitoring as he moves stateside. \nAlger Hodgson , RHP – Hodgson is a 17-year-old Nucaraguan righty who was suspended and did not pitch in 2016 after testing positive for Stanazolol last spring. He sits 93-96 and touches 97, albeit with lots of effort. \nZach Rice , LHP – A low-slot lefty from North Carolina, Rice will touch 95 but has 20 control. \nAlay Lago , UTIL – Despite an immaculate physique, above-average raw power and elite run times in the 60 yard dash, Lago couldn’t generate much interest from MLB clubs after defecting from Cuba. He went to the Mexican League, where his season was cut short due to a drug suspension after he also tested positive for stanozolol. He signed a minor-league deal with Atlanta in December. He’s going to be old for his level, and his approach and swing are both ugly. \nNick Shumpert , INF – Shumpert is the son of former major-leaguer Terry Shumpert , who had that one .347/.413/.584 season in 1999 but only had one other 100-plus wRC+ season in a 13-year big-league career. Nick has some power, but his approach and timing are both raw. He fits much better at second base than he does at short, so the bat needs to come. \nCistulli’s Guy Jared James, OF, 1.3 KATOH+ James’ amateur profile isn’t the sort that typically portends greatness. He was signed, for example, only after his senior year of college. At a DII school, actually. Where he didn’t inspire sufficient confidence in his coaches even to play center field. And lacked the signature power of a corner outfielder. \nUnsurprisingly, he wasn’t selected until the 34th round. Perhaps more surprisingly, however, James acquitted himself quite well as a professional — in particular during his 100 plate appearances at Low-A Rome, where he recorded a strikeout rate of only 11% while producing nearly a .200 ISO. All this while playing at just about the league-average age. \nThere are a number of caveats to make, obviously. Relative to his pedigree, however, it was a very promising performance — and similar enough to his college output to suggest it might be a reflection of true talent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:54:44.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
