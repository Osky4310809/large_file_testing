The EU, they communicated to us, and they want a health-based solution for the drugs. These sons of bitches,” he said. Rodrigo Duterte tells China huge ocean area 'is ours' \nThe EU's rehabilitation approach, he said, entailed administering drugs like cocaine, marijuana and heroin. \n“They want us to build clinics, then instead of arresting, putting them in prisons, just like in other countries, you go there and if you want shabu, they will inject you and give you shabu and you go out,” he said, referring to the methamphetamine used in the Philippines. \n“Our people will just go there and consume every chemical until kingdom come, until they are crazy... who will answer for these?” \nEU lawmakers last week condemned the “many extrajudicial killings” taking place in the Philippines and said the sources of illegal drugs should be targeted, not the consumer. Duterte's aides accused the EU of meddling. \nIt was not the first time Duterte has scolded the EU. In September he made a middle-finger gesture and made profane comments about the EU, then complained he had been insulted.

The authorities reject that and attribute them to vigilantes, or drugs gangs covering their tracks. \nThe government rejects criticism it lacks commitment to rehabilitate drug users and says it is attracting financing and building treatment facilities, but had underestimated the scale of addiction.

My God, you trace your history. You also washed your hands with blood. Why are you suggesting a stupid solution?” \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T14:11:38.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
