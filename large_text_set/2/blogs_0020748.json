It’s thought that the firm has decided against releasing the devices a week early — like it did with the Galaxy Note 7 — in its home country to ensure it has “stable supplies” for the rest of the regions they’ll be available in. \nThis information comes courtesy of a “high-ranking official for a mobile network provider” in South Korea, who added that if initial consumer response to the LG G6, which will launch worldwide on Friday, March 10, is positive, there’s a good chance that Samsung will open pre-orders for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus earlier than expected, though no details on a specific reservation date were provided. \nWe have to say, this latest purported release date seems entirely feasible. Back in December, a report surfaced claiming that Samsung would commence sales of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus on Tuesday, April 18 following an unveiling event that was expected to take place in New York City a week before — so it being pushed back to Friday, April 21 is realistic, especially if the firm started to experience minor unexpected delays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:58:53.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
