This new advertisement spot is from the latter, and describes the new City as being “worlds ahead.” \nSeen here is the range-topping ZX variant offered to customers in India, so it gets all the goodies, with LED headlights (with integrated DRLs), LED fog lights, and 16-inch diamond-cut alloys, bootlid spoiler (with integrated LED brake light), LED taillights and an electric sunroof for the exterior. \nWith the facelift, the City now gets a Civic-inspired front end, with a new chrome bar grille and honeycomb mesh. Elsewhere, the front and rear bumpers have also been reshaped, where the lower apron is now more aggressive-looking on the former. \nInside, the big change is a new 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system that comes with 1.5GB of internal media storage capacity, Mirrorlink support, a variety of inputs and navigation. Said system is also linked to four speakers and four tweeters positioned inside the cabin. \nJust below that, there’s a new touch control panel for the car’s automatic climate control, as well as a new engine start/stop button beside it with white and red illumination. For safety, the City in ZX guise gets six airbags (dual front, side and curtain), ABS with EBD and Isofix rear child seat anchors. \nAs for what’s under the hood, customers in the republic get to choose from two 1.5 litre engines. The first is a four-cylinder SOHC i-VTEC petrol unit (119 PS at 6,600 rpm/145 Nm at 4,600 rpm), while the other is a four-cylinder DOHC i-DTEC diesel (100 PS at 3,600 rpm/200 Nm at 1,750 rpm). Only those petrol-powered models get the option of a five-speed manual or CVT, while the oil burning version gets a six-speed manual only.
