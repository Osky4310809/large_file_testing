The bank and the EFCC got all the judgments of the court, but the agency still harassed the bank to act against the law. If I sent somebody with a cheque, they could give excuse but I was there myself; acts of impunity such as this cannot continue. We will challenge them.” \nHe added that he had received revelations that he would be “number one” in the country. \n“Have you noticed that every attempt to impeach me has failed? How I will get there don’t ask me.” \nOn his recent election as the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party’s Governors’ Forum, Fayose said, “ By the grace of God, we are going to reposition our party. The PDP is only a sleeping giant and when it wakes up, those mocking us now will quake. Charlatans who are one leg in, one leg out and causing confusion in the party would have to decide where to belong.” \nIn a related development, the governor has called on the Federal Government to review corps members’ monthly allowance from N19,500 to N50,000. \nAccording to him, the current allowance can no longer sustain them as Nigeria continues to grapple with recession. \nFayose also decried the deplorable state of the Ekiti National Youth Service Corps’ orientation camp in Ise/Emure, pledging an immediate release of N20m for its renovation. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:23:07.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
