A Trump Administration will empower our law enforcement officers to do their jobs and keep our streets free of crime and violence. The Trump Administration will be a law and order administration. President Trump will honor our men and women in uniform and will support their mission of protecting the public. The dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America is wrong. The Trump Administration will end it.\nIt goes on to cite crime statistics and then reaffirms Trump's commitment to upholding the Second Amendment. Toward the bottom of the page is a reference to Trump's controversial plan to build a wall along the Mexican border:\nPresident Trump is committed to building a border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. He is dedicated to enforcing our border laws, ending sanctuary cities, and stemming the tide of lawlessness associated with illegal immigration.\nSupporting law enforcement also means deporting illegal aliens with violent criminal records who have remained within our borders.\nAs part of his overhaul of the website, Trump also removed almost every allusion to climate change, as well as a page dedicated to LGBT rights, according to the New York Times.\nThere is now concern among scientists that the new administration will take things one step further and erase crucial climate change data collected by the government over the years.\n\"The government has done a great job of collecting and maintaining climate change data on these websites located all across the federal government,\" said Shaughnessy Naughton, founder of 314 Action, a nonprofit group devoted to educating the public about science. \"The concern is that the data may no longer be publicly available, and then that they may no longer gather the data. It's a lot easier to deny climate change when you don't have data.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T19:19:08.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
