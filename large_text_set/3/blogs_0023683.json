At that time, HMD indicated the Nokia 6 would be available globally, but now we have some more clarification on the company’s plans to launch its new smartphones.\nSee also: Can Nokia and BlackBerry stand on their own, or is it all hype and nostalgia? 3 weeks ago In a statement sent to NokiaPowerUser , a spokesperson for HMD said that the current plan is to launch the Nokia 6, 5 and 3 phones “in 120 markets at same time in Q2 2017.” That’s between April and June. HMD first launched the Nokia 6 in China earlier this year . Clove in the UK has already stated it will sell the Nokia 5 and 3 in May , followed by the Nokia 6 in June.\nWill the US be getting these phones? Responding to a question from a fan, the official Nokia Mobile Twitter account stated, “We’re planning on a global release so yes they will be.” By the way, don’t look for the new version of the Nokia 3310 feature phone to be released in the US, at least for a while. The phone uses 2G networks, which are no longer available in the country. It’s possible HMD could release a new version of the phone in the future that will be compatible with modern US cellular networks.\nWe were impressed when we got to spend some time with the Nokia 6, 5, and 3 at MWC 2017 . We admired the phones’ excellent build quality and the fact that they were running stock versions of Android 7.0 Nougat . Hopefully we won’t have to wait too long to get these phones, all of which should also be very affordable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T12:15:43.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
