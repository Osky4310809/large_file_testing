Yup, some of the movies you loved as a kid were meant for adults and had some very adult subject matter. Movies like... Grease \n(source) \nWhen you were a kid, you sang along to the songs in Grease , blissfully unaware of how dirty some of the lyrics actually were. \"Tell Me More\" isn't about summer love. It's about Johnny telling his friends he did it with Sandy. And Rizzo sings a song making fun of Sandy for being a virgin, then has a solo about her own teen pregnancy scare. Believe it or not, this movie is raunchy, y'all. Dirty Dancing \n(source) \nIt's called Dirty Dancing for crying out loud. What do you expect it to be about?? There's straight up an abortion in Dirty Dancing . And Johnny and Baby's dynamic is pretty messed up if you think about it. He pretty much puts her in a corner, then tells her nobody puts her in a corner. But it has music from the '60s, so it's cool! Beetlejuice \n(source) \nKids who aren't scared sh*tless of Beetlejuice love it. And he is a fun character... even though he hits on everything that movies, visits a whore house, and is an all around scumbag. To top it off, the movie's climax features a creepy older man trying to marry a teenage girl, which, to be fair, is also the climax of Sense and Sensibility . Spaceballs \n(source) \nMore than half the jokes in Spaceballs go over kids' heads, but that doesn't stop them from thinking it's one of the funniest movies on the planet. Who knew that the broad humor of Mel Brooks would resonate with people who have a fourth-grade education like, you know, fourth graders? Back to the Future \n(source) \nMarty McFly's mom has the hots for him throughout the entire movie, which is a really, really weird thing to let your kids watch. We all grew up watching Back to the Future and society still hasn't normalized moms falling in love with their sons, so that's good. Who Framed Rodger Rabbit? \n(source) \nWho Framed Rodger Rabbit? proves that just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids. Seriously, WTF was up with Robert Zemeckis (who is also responsible for Back to the Future ) directing movies for adults that also became for kids in the '80s? Was he trying to corrupt an entire generation of youth? Ghostbusters \n(source) \nDan Akroyd gets a beej from a ghost and Bill Murray jokes about the EPA inspector being d*ckless. And yet, Ghostbusters has become so much a kids movie that it even spawned a cartoon and oodles of merch for kids. Sorry kids, this movie was meant for grown ups! \nWhat was your favorite movie you watched as a kid that you probably shouldn't have?
