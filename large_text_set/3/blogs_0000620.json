Jax and Reddy can. “Deep down inside, yes [Jax] absolutely notices there are differences in skin color,” Rosebush told Inside Edition . “However, he doesn’t care. The only difference to him is their hair doesn’t match.” She concluded the post by saying, “If this isn’t proof that hate and prejudice is something that is taught I don’t know what is.” The 5-year-old has always had a “big heart,” according to his mother. “He’s the kid that won’t let you kill bugs because he doesn’t want them to die. He is always trying to give his toys to kids he doesn’t think have toys,” she told Yahoo Canada. Her Facebook post has since received more than 9,000 likes and has been shared thousands of times, with many leaving comments praising Jax. “Damn that gave me chills reading that, love children man wish they could keep that innocence forever,” wrote one commenter. “You are an inspiration to us adults Jax,” wrote another. Rosebush said she was overwhelmed by the number of positive reactions she received. “I had no idea it would resonate with so many people. I try really hard to make sure both of my kids know that the color of someone’s skin or even their religion have nothing to do with what kind of friend they could be,” she said. “I just try to raise my little humans to be kind and tolerant adults one day. Parenting is so very hard and has no instruction manual, so when your kid says or does something like this you can’t help but high-five yourself, because you might actually be doing this thing right.” Read more from Yahoo Beauty:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:32:39.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
