However, during the previous hearing on January 24, the court expressed reservations against the presence of some 70-year-olds among the list of nine names submitted by Subramanium. \nThe court then asked the BCCI, some state associations, and the federal government, which was represented by Attornery General of India Mukul Rohatgi, to submit three names each by January 27 in a sealed envelope. \nOn January 2, the Supreme Court had removed BCCI president Anurag Thakur and secretary Ajay Shirke from their posts for not implementing the majority of the Lodha committee's recommendations despite being told to do so by a Supreme Court order on July 18, 2016. \nThe court also ordered the other office bearers of the BCCI and state associations, who did not meet the eligibility criteria set by the Lodha Committee, to step down. According to the committee's recommendations, an office bearer should be a citizen of India, should not be 70 years or older, should not be a government servant or minister, should not hold office in another sports organisation, should not have held office with the BCCI or state association for more than nine years, should not be insolvent or of unsound mind, and should not have a criminal record. \nAll office bearers who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were permitted to continue but were asked to file an undertaking in the Supreme Court that they would implement the Lodha Committee's recommendations. \nThe Lodha Committee was formed in January 2015 to determine appropriate punishments for some of the officials involved in the 2013 IPL corruption scandal, and also to propose changes to streamline the BCCI, reform its functioning, prevent sporting fraud and conflict of interest. \nIn January 2016, the committee released its report , which recommended an exhaustive overhaul of the BCCI's governance and administrative structures. On July 18, the Supreme Court approved the majority of the recommendations and directed the Lodha Committee to supervise the BCCI's implementations of the same. However, despite the Lodha Committee laying out timelines and other directives, the board did not cooperate because its state associations objected to the recommendations. The impasse eventually culminated in the removal of Thakur and Shirke and the appointment of a committee of administrators to supervise the BCCI until fresh office bearers were elected. \nMore to follow … \nNagraj Gollapudi is a senior assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo © ESPN Sports Media Ltd.
