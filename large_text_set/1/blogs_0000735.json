Viral “Let It Go” car karaokes give way to #Hamilkids sing-a-longs , and even the ever-present Tiger Mom loses ground after her time in the spotlight. \nLet’s face it, by the time these trends disappear into the distance – usually after dominating mom blogs and Facebook feeds for months – we’re often all too happy to see the last of them. \nSo, now that they new year is upon us, maybe it’s time to say a fond farewell to a few kid-related crazes that have proven stubbornly persistent. Here are some that I personally wouldn’t miss in 2017… \nFirst, let me say that I've been to gender reveal - or, more accurately, sex reveal - parties and felt honored each time to be on the invite list. It's a big moment, discovering something about the little life that's growing inside you. The thing is, with so many big and interesting discussions going on about gender definitions, roles and expectations, I can't help but wonder if these pink-or-blue bashes are rooted in old ideas. Being pregnant and looking down that long and incredible road of parenthood is absolutely worth celebrating; maybe it's just time to leave the \"gender\" bit out of it. \nPinterest is a beautiful, glittering time-suck, but unfortunately it feeds into a larger trend that weighs on way too many moms: Perfectionist parenting. We can't just send our kids to school with a Tupperware full of Rice Krispie treats on the last day before Christmas break. Nooo. We need to cut those treats into reindeer shapes, stick them on Popsicle sticks, decorate them with frosting and M&Ms and hand-crafted sugar eyeballs and lovingly wrap each one in ribbon-adorned cellophane bags. I know, because I did it . It took me hours and I went to work the next morning hooked up to a caffeine IV drip. And you know what? The kids liked them. But they probably would have liked plain old Rice Krispie treats just as much. \nThe napkins don't match the party theme? Oh well. Your kid's pancakes aren't shaped like baby panda bears? No worries. You didn't construct boho-chic forts in the backyard for your preschooler's birthday party? I'm pretty sure they'll survive. \nI was determined not to over-schedule my kids, yet here I am shuttling them back and forth from soccer practices, piano lessons and dance classes. Then there are the weekend games, the skiing lessons, the science and art camps. The funny thing is, I really do believe that they do their most creative thinking and playing in the spaces in between all of these scheduled activities, when they're left to build blanket forts in the living room and bug habitats in the front yard. As a family, we feel most connected when we have free time to fill together. Still, all of those classes give them valuable skills and experiences, as well. The trick is to find that balance between the two. \nDr. Munther Barakat recently offered this advice : \"Take a step back and ask yourself, why am I scheduling my child so much? And really measure whether it's benefiting them.\" \nI'll be working on it in 2017. \nBreast vs bottle. It's the tired old battle that just won't end, but here's hoping we can ditch it for good in 2017. Bottle or breast, in public or in private, covered up or right out in the open... none of it makes any difference whatsoever to me. You do you, mama; I'll support you 100%. Motherhood is overwhelming enough without having to worry about being judged for the way we choose to feed our children. \nAnd end to \"Mommy guilt?\" This may be asking for the impossible, but it's worth a shot. This persistent guilt often sinks its claws into a woman during pregnancy and never, ever lets go. How you birth your baby, how you feed your baby, how you put her to sleep, how you entertain her, how you educate her. Tummy time, screen time, quality time... it all seems to come with that nagging, nasty guilt attached. Wouldn't it be nice if we could just shake it once and for all? \nThe next time you start to feel that familiar pang, stop and ask yourself this: Do you love your child? And are you doing the best you can? If so, then I think you're probably doing just fine. \nAre there any on this list that you’d be sad to see the end of? \nOut with the old, in with the new. According to Pinterest searches, these are the parenting trends that seem to be on the rise for 2017 : \nHomemade popsicles: Up 44% \nWhat kid doesn't love a popsicle?

I'm a Little Teapot, Five Little Monkeys... I'm sure you have a few favorites in your homes, too. The huge grins those songs got from my girls - I would have sung them all day long. DIY finger puppets would take that fun to a whole new level. \n(Photo: Flickr/Soon Koon) \nWoodland nursery design: Up 97% \nThere's one word for this trend: Adorable! Bring the forest indoors with woodland-themed nursery decor. Sweet little owls, foxes and deer will keep your little one company as he drifts off to dreamland.

My girls have built a couple of fairy gardens in potted plants in the front yard, and it's so cute to watch them come up with all kinds of creative scenarios for their resident pixies.
