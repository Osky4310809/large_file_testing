They are among the 850 refugees already cleared by the State Department that the Trump Administration is now allowing into the country. \n“Grateful for those who were able to make it here in the next few days, but there are so many more we need to give that same opportunity to,” Schaffer said. \nThe volunteers helping the refugees are still riding that roller coaster. \nThe sisters left Zambia for Doha, but a security issue kept them from continuing on to the U.S. The particulars of that issue are unclear, but both sisters are expected to arrive at O’Hare Airport Wednesday afternoon.
