(Photo: Jamie McCarthy, Getty Images for Marc Jacobs) \nMaybe he's born with it, too! \nMale beauty vlogger Manny Gutierrez, known on Instagram and YouTube as \"MannyMua,\" has become the first male face of Maybelline. He shared the news that he's starring in the brand's Big Shot Mascara campaign with fellow social media star Shayla Mitchell. \"Honestly I couldn't be more honored thrilled!\" he wrote. \"Thank you to Maybelline for taking a chance on me!\" A video posted by ðŸŒ™Manny Gutierrez (@mannymua733) on Jan 3, 2017 at 6:01pm PST \nGutierrez, who has 3 million Instagram followers and 2 million YouTube subscribers, writes in his page descriptions that \"I believe makeup is GenderLESS and has not rules\" and \"boys deserve just as much cosmetic recognition.\" A video posted by Maybelline New York (@maybelline) on Jan 3, 2017 at 5:18pm PST \nMaybelline's hiring of Gutierrez is a big step in what has been a recent shift in the cosmetic industry, to cater to more men. A few months ago, CoverGirl named its first CoverBoy , James Charles, and former fashion writer David Yi launched a new beauty site for men , called Very Good Light. \nFor more of Gutierrez's makeup looks check out some glam shots from his Instagram: A photo posted by ðŸŒ™Manny Gutierrez (@mannymua733) on Nov 4, 2016 at 7:13pm PDT A photo posted by ðŸŒ™Manny Gutierrez (@mannymua733) on Nov 22, 2016 at 7:12pm PST A photo posted by ðŸŒ™Manny Gutierrez (@mannymua733) on Oct 21, 2016 at 5:59pm PDT Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hXEe0h Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:44:30.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
