By Sarah K. Spencer / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nPine-Richland maintained a steady lead and senior Andrew Petcash scored 30 points as the Rams took down North Hills, 85-62, in the WPIAL 6A semifinals Wednesday at North Allegheny. \nPine-Richland, which narrowly beat North Hills twice in the regular season, had a 79-62 lead with a minute left in the fourth quarter. Enter the subs from the bench. \nThere was still time, though, for two easy layups by Petcash and a victory-sealing dunk with seconds remaining in a rematch of last year’s WPIAL 4A championship, when Pine-Richland won its first WPIAL basketball title. \n“He’s a tremendous basketball player,” Pine-Richland coach Jeff Ackermann said of Petcash. “He can do a lot of different stuff.” \nThe Rams successfully carried out their strategy of making the Indians play from behind, Ackermann said. Pine-Richland will face Butler at 9 p.m. Saturday at the Petersen Events Center for the championship. \n“Our guys are really focused right now, which is good,” Ackermann said. “They really wanted it. They wanted to get back. They wanted to prove that they’re the best team in the west. And I couldn’t be happier with how we played right from the bat.” \nA 3-pointer by North Hills guard Kamron Taylor cut the Rams’ lead to 68-60 in the fourth quarter with three minutes to play, but Pine-Richland responded and a jump shot by Petcash made it 74-60. Another jumper by Phil Jurkovec and a layup and free throw by Andrew Kristofic put the game out of reach at 79-62 with a minute left in the fourth. Pine-Richland held North Hills, led by Nick Smith with 22 points, to 13 points in the fourth quarter. \nPine-Richland got off to a quick start, jumping out to a six-point lead in the first quarter and lengthening its lead to 10 throughout most of the second quarter. Rams guard Evan Luellen drove to the hoop for a layup, making it 32-22 with 4:32 left in the second. \nThen Taylor sunk a 3, cutting the Indians’ deficit to 36-29, but Luellen responded with a 3-pointer on the next possession. Pine-Richland entered halftime up, 42-32. \n“I liked our chances, and we led the whole game, and that was key,” Ackermann said, whose only critique of his team was to increase its focus on rebounding heading into the championship. “Not letting them get too close to us.” \nOther semifinal \nEthan Morton exited the game with 50 seconds left to Butler’s student section chanting “MVP! MVP!” \nWhen he sat down on the bench, he turned to some fans in the first row and had his own rallying cry: “We’re going to The Pete!” \nAnd with about 15 seconds left, that’s when coach Matt Clement finally felt like he could celebrate. \nMorton, Butler’s freshman star, tied a career-high with 23 points, Tyler Frederick had a double-double of 13 points and 11 rebounds, and the No. 7 seed Golden Tornado whirled past No. 11 Woodland Hills, 54-36, at Fox Chapel to reach its first WPIAL title game since 2000. \nThe Wolverines jumped out to a 7-0 lead less than two minutes in, but by the fourth quarter, that early storm seemed like a different game. \n“That was the key to the game,” said Clement, who called a timeout to stop the Wolverines momentum. “We bent but we didn’t break.” \nIf that was key, so was Morton. The 6-foot-5 point guard completed two strong three-point plays in crucial moments. The first put Butler (17-8) ahead, 23-21, just before halftime, its first lead of the game. The second came with 4:55 left in the third quarter for a 30-27 lead, and Woodland Hills (16-9) never got back in front. \n“I have a totally different perspective because I was coaching him in second grade,” Clement said. “Would I have dreamed he’d turn into this, this early? No, but I knew he was going to be a really good player.” \nButler also held its own inside thanks to Frederick, the senior forward who was saddled with foul trouble last time these two teams met in late December, a 69-67 win for Woodland Hills. \nJunior Amante Britt led the way with 19 points and senior Deontae Robertson added 11 with 11 rebounds for the Wolverines, who fell one win shy of their first WPIAL final. Their season will continue in the PIAA playoffs. Related Media:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T07:21:48.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
