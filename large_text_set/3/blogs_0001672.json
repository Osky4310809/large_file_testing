The answer is yes. Definitely yes.\nThe guys – Nick Carter , Howie Dorough , Brian Littrell , AJ McLean , and Kevin Richardson – kicked off their intimate “Larger Than Life” Las Vegas Residency at The Axis at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino on Wednesday (March 1), and it did not disappoint.\nFans got to reminisce with clips from the the band’s classic music videos before the guys arrived and took the stage for the rest of the night – well, except when they left the stage to perform an entire song in the audience.\nIn 90 minutes, the group brought it all the way back to 1993, taking fans on a nostalgic journey down memory lane complete with costume changes, backup dancers, and light shows.\nBe sure to catch (at least) one of the Backstreet Boys ‘ shows during their 26-date residency!
