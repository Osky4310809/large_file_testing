Smith General Hospital Cameo The World Totally Needs Right Now by Joe DePaolo | 7:11   video \nBack in August, we posted about a cameo appearance made by Stephen A. Smith on General Hospital , the long-running soap of which Smith is a big fan. \nOn the day of Smith’s General Hospital appearance, Robert De Niro happened to be on Smith’s ESPN talk show, First Take, and was asked to critique Smith’s work and give the rookie thespian some advice. \n“Just keep hanging in there, kid,” De Niro said. He added, “Don’t be disappointed, don’t give up.” \nWell doggone it, Smith followed De Niro’s advice and was back on the soap Friday to reprise his role as Brick, whom Smith describes as “a surveillance expert…for the mob.” \nThe result? Three minutes or so of ridiculously awesome soap opera acting. \n“What happened to him, what happened to you and Carly … it’s a tragedy,” Smith/Brick said, mournfully, as he was speaking to a character whose son was killed. \nThen there’s the part when he gets into an argument with another character who asked him where he got a sensitive piece of surveillance equipment. \nBrick: Why you askin’ me about my equipment? \nYou know…(character shrugs) \nWhy are you asking me a question like that? \nJust curious, man. \nWell you know what happened to that cat, don’t you? \nIt’s all there. The methodical movements. The dramatic pauses. The heavy breathing. The whole thing is hilarious. Well done, Stephen A. Turns out Robert De Niro’s advice was spot on. \nWatch above, via ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:32:03.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
