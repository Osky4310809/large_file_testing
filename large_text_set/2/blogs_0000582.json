Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSaido Berahino was suspended during his time at West Brom , Stoke boss Mark Hughes has confirmed, following reports of a failed drugs test. \nThe Stoke striker is believed to have tested positive for a recreational drug during an out of competition test and the Potters boss has confirmed that he was hit with an eight-week suspension by the FA. \n\"We were aware of that before we signed him. In terms of more detail you'd need to refer back to his former club,\" said Hughes. \n\"There was an FA disciplinary matter and Saido had an 8-week suspension, I believe. We don't have any more details.\" Saido Berahino was suspended by the FA (Photo: Alex Livesey) Pulis has confirmed Berahino served a ban - but wouldn't go into specifics (Photo: PA) \nAnd while West Brom chief Tony Pulis also confirmed the issue, he has refused to confirm precisely why. \n\"Saido served a ban while he was here but I won't comment why,\" said the Albion chief. \"He didn't play for me because he wasn't fit enough.\" \n\"Saido is no longer an Albion player. He is at a club which I used to manage and I have respect for. It's one for Stoke to handle. \n\"This football club looked after Saido very well while he was here. The club looks after all the players. \"Saido was one of the main reasons this club stayed in the Premier League two seasons ago.\" Berahino made his Stoke debut against Everton in midweek (Photo: Gareth Copley) \nBerahino's suspension finished before he moved to Stoke in a Â£12million deal last month. \nThe 23-year-old's last first-team game for the Baggies was back in September and he never appeared again for the Black Country-based side until turning out for the Under-23s on December 12. \nA Baggies ever-present in 2014-15 when he scored 20 goals and was touted for a full England call-up, Berahino has only managed four goals in 35 Premier League appearances since May 2015. Berahino signed for Stoke last month (Photo: GETTY) \nIn 2014, he was forced to apologise to the club after pictures showed him inhaling nitrous oxide. Later that year, he was banned from the roads for a year after being caught drink-driving. \nHe also tweeted he would never play again for the Baggies' then-chairman Jeremy Peace, who blocked FOUR bids for Berahino from Tottenham. Then he was packed off to a fitness camp in France in November, after being accused of being overweight. \nHughes insists he will used Berahino when the two sides meet this weekend. \n\"Would I play him? Yes, why wouldn't I? He is in line to be involved tomorrow.\" \nThe Mirror have approached West Brom for comment.
