(Yes, pun intended!) You may recall other times when periods have been in the news, like when the internet applauded this college student regarding period shaming . There was also the time when famous women talked openly about periods . (Insert applause here.) But, we get it — it’s a sensitive topic, and some people even keep their periods a secret .\nWell, not the ever-popular yogi Stephanie (Steph) Góngora, aka @casa_colibri on Instagram. About a week ago, she posted an Insta video. But, this time, she had her period — and it was visible through her pants for all to see.\nHere, you can see the Insta video for yourself, and the ~amazing~ message Góngora writes for all to see, as well. All the while in the video, she does yoga like nbd — she’s not going to let her period (or its visibility!) get in the way! (Insert standing ovation here.)\nI am a woman, therefore, I bleed. . It's messy, it's painful, it's terrible, & it's beautiful. . And yet, you wouldn't know. Because I hide it. . I bury things at the bottom of the trash. I breathe, ragged and awkward through the cramps, all the while holding onto this tight lipped, painted on smile. . Tampons? What are those. We don't say those words out loud. Hide them. In the back pocket of your purse, in the corner of the bathroom drawer, at the very bottom of your shopping cart (please let me get a female cashier). . Events or engagements get missed. I'll tell myself it’s the PMS, sure, but it has more to with the risk of being \"caught,\" at what...I'm not quite sure. . And I’m lucky. . Over 100 million young women around the globe miss school or work for lack of adequate menstrual supplies, & fear of what might happen if the world witnesses A NATURAL BODILY FUNCTION. . WHY? . Because hundreds of years of culture have made us embarrassed to bleed. Have left us feeling dirty and ashamed. . STOP PRETENDING. Stop using silly pet names like Aunt Flo because you're too afraid to say \"I'm bleeding\" or \"vagina.\" Stop wasting so much effort hiding the very thing that gives this species continuity. . START talking about it. Educate your daughters. Make them understand that it can be both an inconvenience and a gift, but NEVER something to be ashamed about. Educate your sons so they don't recoil from the word tampon. So when a girl bleeds through her khaki shorts in third period (pun intended), they don't perpetuate the cycle of shame and intolerance. . This #StartSomethingSunday , I want to highlight @corawomen . . Cora Women is a 100% Organic tampon company. . But that’s not all. They are also breaking barriers. Making it ok to talk about periods, even on social media. Providing personalized, delivered tampon/pad orders right to your door. AND for every box purchased, donating a box of sustainable pads to girls who can't afford menstruation products. . Fuck yeah. That's the kind of stuff I can galvanize behind, no money or even product needed. Just a mission I support on a topic we should ALL be talking about. . More ⬇️ \nA video posted by Steph Gongora (@casa_colibri) on Feb 5, 2017 at 11:06am PST \nGóngora posted the above video to make a statement , she told Cosmopolitan .\n“I knew a bright red blood spot on pristine white pants would make a statement in a society that rarely takes the time to actually read — that catching people’s eye with something a little more shocking might be necessary to snap them out of their social media scrolling,” she said to Cosmopolitan . “Leaks are SUCH a typical occurrence for me, and something, I believe, women shouldn’t have to be ashamed of.” Hear, hear!\nAnd, as you can see above in Góngora’s IG post, she certainly got people talking — and viewing. As of this writing, it’s been viewed nearly 230,000 times.\n“I’ve been successful in getting people to talk about period shame,” she told Cosmopolitan , “something that was shrouded in such silence for far too long…I do hope that this cycle of shame and intolerance around the very thing that gives our species continuity can, one day soon, stop.” \nWe could have not said that better ourselves, and only hope that the conversation keeps going, and going, and going…#nomoreperiodshaming.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:34:47.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
