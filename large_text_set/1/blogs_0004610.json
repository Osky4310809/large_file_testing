The first host is expected to be announced on Thursday.

Sundance officials estimate nearly 30,000 people attend the festival each year. \n“We open this march and event to everyone who respects human rights, civil liberties, and diversity. Despite its title, like the marches happening nationwide, this march is for women AND men,” the listing concluded. \nIssues with zoning and starting points for the march have yet to be resolved. The event will also have several charitable components allowing participants to donate to left-leaning causes, which will be announced at a later date. \nThe 2017 Sundance Film Festival runs Jan. 19 – 29.
