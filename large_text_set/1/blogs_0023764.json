The grungy image layout for the 18th issue of FELT Zine looks like a series of objects you might pull out of your clogged shower drain. These are four new works by Turkish digital artist Helin Sahin . In some of her lush compositions you can just make out a few tangible objects—nunchaku, a snake, a helmet—but for the most part, her images look completely alien. This is partly what makes her works so interesting: she creates completely foreign, almost indecipherable imagery out of recognizable objects and materials. She bends and distorts each component to the point of confusion. Sahin tells The Creators Project, “I see the correlations between the objects and materials I use but like to imagine them in a different way than they actually function or are used. It's more appealing to me.” The central image in the series is a piece titled self portrait , which features a horned glass mask entwined with dark black hair hosting embers in its tails. Another piece has a discernible lava texture covered by a glassy material, and other odd objects that appear to be clinging for dear life. By using 3D programs and setttings in non-traditional formats, Sahin is able to produce these abstract works with natural looking materials. Sahin tells The Creators Project, “I think my biggest inspiration is self discovery. I'm always experimenting, pushing formats and expanding my capabilities.” Check out the 18th Issue of FELT Zine here , and check out more of Helin Sahin’s work on her Instagram .
