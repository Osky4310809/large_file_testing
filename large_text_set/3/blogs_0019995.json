So, the door remains open for Luis Cessa and Chad Green.\n“I hope sooner than later, but it’s not really ironing out that way,’’ manager Joe Girardi said of naming the fourth and fifth starters. “Some guys have had some struggles. Your hope is that someone would step up and dominate, but it hasn’t been that way.\nMitchell worked 4 ¹/₃ innings in a 4-2 loss to the Red Sox, allowing two runs in the third inning.\n“He was OK. You look at the line score and it was OK. He gave up some hard-hit balls,’’ Girardi said of Mitchell, who surrendered seven hits and fanned seven. “I thought he could have used his curveball a little bit more effectively, he had a good curveball.’’\nMitchell said he was pleased with the outing.\n“As far as everything I thought it was the best stuff I have had throughout the outings,’’ Mitchell said. “I actually got a few outs on the splitter.’’\nCessa gave up a run, two hits and walked two in two frames and could be headed for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to provide rotation depth.\nDellin Betances said he wasn’t sure when he would pitch for the Yankees next, but didn’t hesitate when asked about being ready for Opening Day.\n“I am ready for the season to start,’’ Betances said Tuesday at George M. Steinbrenner Field after returning from playing with the Dominican Republican team in the World Baseball Classic. “I am ready to go.’’\nDellin Betances Charles Wenzelberg Betances last worked Saturday and said the experience of playing for the D.R. won’t soon leave him.\n“I am not going to lie. I thought it was more than expected,’’ Betances said. “The crowds in Miami were intense. The crowd was definitely on our side in Miami. It was a very intense crowd from the first inning to the ninth inning. San Diego was fun even though we came up short.’’\nBetances had a choice to play for the USA or the Dominican, and said it was a difficult decision. How he was received by the Dominican’s fans made him feel good.\n“The love I got from the Dominican fans was unbelievable,’’ said Betances. “I didn’t think it would be like that but a lot of people, the Dominican fans were happy I chose to play for them.’’\nChris Sale might be new to the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, but he is a quick learner.\nSale made the long ride from Fort Myers to Tampa to face the Yankees to get a taste of the scene.\n“Anytime you can get as close as you can to a regular-season game with the atmosphere, the intensity, the energy level, you like to do that, so I was glad I came up here,’’ Sale said after striking out 10 in six innings in which he gave up two runs and four hits. \n“Anybody who knows anything about sports knows about Boston and New York. Even from the outside looking in you can sense the competitive drive in these teams. Coming here playing against the Yankees, at their park, night game, gives it more of a regular-season feel.’’\nClint Frazier went head over heels over the right-field wall chasing a foul ball.\n“It is not the first time I have collided with a wall,’’ said Frazier, who landed on his back but wasn’t injured. “I was not going full speed so I braced myself. It was a lot more graceful than it looked.’’\nMatt Holliday’s solid spring continued when the DH hit an opposite-field homer to right off lefty Chris Sale in the sixth inning. It was Holliday’s fourth spring homer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T08:08:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
