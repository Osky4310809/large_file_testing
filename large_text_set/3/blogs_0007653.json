Spin \nIf your company had been recently accused of cultivating a sexist culture, you might stay away from a party called \"Babes and Balls\". \nNot so Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who played ping pong at a \"Babes and Balls\" themed party on Friday night. \nHe and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were among those celebrating Dropbox CEO Drew Houston's birthday at San Francisco ping pong bar Spin. \nThis is a week when Uber's had to drop its secret, regulation-dodging \"Greyball\" tool , launch a search for a new COO , and investigate its own allegedly sexist workplace practices. \"Gee, I wonder why women feel unwelcome in tech?\" wrote one Twitter user , engineering professor Brian Noble. \nSpin is part-owned by Susan Sarandon and has run similarly questionable themed nights before. Prior to last week's party was a \"Babes and Balls Arabian Nights\" which featured underwear-clad belly dancers dancing on the tables. \nAt least soon-to-be second-time father Mark Zuckerberg had a wild time. Here's Travis Kalanick looking unconcerned in a doubles game with Drew Houston. \nSpin", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T12:42:50.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
