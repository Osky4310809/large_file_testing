I knew I’d feel better if I lost weight. I had a few health issues and you really shouldn’t be worrying about your health in the way I was when you’re in your twenties. \n\"My dad was really worried that I would develop diabetes. I was getting really fed up and just sick of it.\" A post shared by Cormac Nugent (@cormac_nugent) on Feb 21, 2017 at 1:57am PST \nThe customer service worker joined his local FlyeFit gym in Ranelagh last year, where he began weight-training and said Instagram was a great way to document his progress. \n\"Taking regular pictures of myself along the way was a good motivation. A post shared by Cormac Nugent (@cormac_nugent) on Jan 7, 2017 at 5:32am PST \n\"Instagram has definitely been a resource that I’ve turned to this year. It’s a great place to post your own progress, and I’ve developed quite a good support network on that. There’s so many inspiring health and fitness accounts to follow and they can be a great source of motivation and, of course, advice.\" \nThe 27-year-old said nailing his diet was the key to reclaiming his health and he has made a commitment to preparing as much of his own healthy meals as possible. \n\"When I started working in the bank my weight just kept piling on. It’s hard in Dublin when you’re surrounded by such lovely restaurants and you end up not making the best choices at lunch time – whatever is quick and easy. \n\"My portions were also way too much of the wrong things. \n\"Now I just make a huge effort to prepare everything from scratch and just bring my lunch into work. It’s made a giant difference.\" \nCormac is now training to become a personal trainer and advised those who may be in the same position as he was in last year to realise that there is never going to be the perfect time to start losing weight. The bank worker’s ultimate goal is to lost 8st (50kg) and to achieve the physique he has always dreamed of. \n\"Put it this way, if you really want to do it you will do it now. There’s no point in saying 'I’ll do this after the wedding or I’ll begin the morning after that 21st'. Make yourself some small goals because the long-term one can feel like you’ll never reach it. It’s easy to lose sight of what you’re trying to do.\" \nThe bank worker’s ultimate goal is to lost 8st (50kg) and to achieve the physique he has always dreamed of. \n\"I guess when I made that decision to tackle my weight I was motivated by what I saw as the end goal. That ripped physique, a six pack. I set my goal as 93kg, [to lose] 8st in total, which I hope to achieve by May. \n\"It’s great to look back at those photos and to see how far I’ve really come since taking those first ones.\" Online Editors Follow @Indo_Life Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T16:44:46.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
