E. Pablo Kosmicki, Denver Post file Burro racing veteran Curtis Imrie attacks a steep grade just outside Alma during the Fairplay Burro Days race in 2005. He died on Jan. 21, 2017, as he prepared to show a burro at the National Western Stock Show. \nImrie, 70, died of a heart attack as he was walking through a barn to prepare a donkey for the show ring, Stock Show president Paul Andrews said on Monday. \n“He certainly died with is boots on,” his brother Gordon Imrie said. “He was literally backstage at the Stock Show.” \nGrowing up in Georgia, Imrie was interested in animals. He took horseback riding lessons, and “he would catch little critters, he loved snakes and chipmunks,” Gordon Imrie said. \nHe attended Northwestern University, where he was a Big 10 wrestler. He pursued an acting and modeling career in Los Angeles for several years and then, in 1973 moved to Colorado, after his brother, John, drowned in an accident on the Arkansas River. \n“What was left was a cabin my parents had built, and my mother gave it to Curtis,” Gordon Imrie said. \nAs a wrestler, his training regimen included running, and he once told Denver Post columnist Ed Quillan. “I got to like the road work, especially on our back roads.” \nHe was running in the woods when he met rancher Oscar Chapa, who had burros and partnered with runners to participate in pack-burro racing, the only sport indigenous to Colorado. \nChapa, who provided mules for racers, told him about Leadville’s pack burro race over Mosquito Pass. “You got the legs,” Chapa told him, “I got the ass.” \nThe idea interested Imrie, and he began participating in the races, eventually adopting wild burros from the Bureau of Land Management, and breeding them at his Little Menokin Ranch near Buena Vista. \nHe ran in every World Champion Pack Burro Race, a feature of Fairplay’s Burro Days, beginning in 1973, and was a three-time world champion. \nPack-burro racing requires a determined competitor with strong legs and a compliant burro. \nRacers lead their donkeys 29 miles on a grueling course that starts at 10,000 feet, and climbs to 13,000, before beginning the descent, according to Hal Walter, a friend of Curtis, and fellow pack racer. \n“You can’t ride,” Walter said, “you are running the whole time. The terrain is really rugged, its just a jumble of rocks.” \nCurtis made his entry into Colorado’s political scene in 1992 with a write-in independent run for the state legislature. \nHe ran as a Democrat for the state house of representatives in 1994, losing to incumbent Republican Ken Chlouber, of Leadville, another pack-burro racer.

Photo provided by Ken Scar \n“That novelty — in the whole world, there are fewer than 100 pack-burro racers — attracted some major-league media attention, including a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal,” according to Quillen’s 2002 column. \nIn 2000, Imrie unsuccessfully ran in Colorado’s Third Congressional District against Republican incumbent Scott McInnis. Two years later, after Colorado’s congressional districts were redrawn, he ran in the Fifth District, against Republican incumbent Joel Hefley and lost again. \n“He ran for office at least six times,” his brother said. “He was always a sort of Bernie Sanders kind of progressive. He had three main interests, donkeys, democracy and drama.” \nHis interest in burros brought him into contact with members of the animal-rights movement, and led him to enter politics, Gordon Imrie said. \nImrie championed the environment, equal treatment for all, and campaign finance reform , Walters said. “He was not a fan of money in politics. That was probably a big reason he never got a lot of votes because he didn’t take money from corporations.” \nAnd though he left Los Angeles for Colorado, his interest in theater never flagged. He produced and directed several independent films, performed on stage both regionally, and on the east and west coasts, and had a bit part in one of the Star Trek movies, in which he played a Vulcan, Walter said. \nHis most recent acting role was portrayal of Mike Rust, a Mountain Bike Hall of Famer, and murder victim, in “The Rider and the Wolf,” a 2015 production by the Grit and Thistle Film Company. \nImrie also sat on the board of kHEN, a low-power community radio station in Salida, where he hosted a weekly radio show, “Poetry and Stories.” \nThe death of a man who regularly raced up steep mountain slopes came as a surprise to those who knew him.
