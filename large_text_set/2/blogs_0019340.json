And at the very least we might see a teaser video of the S8 at MWC. \nAnd it's possible Samsung will use MWC to show off something else - there's talk of two foldable phones coming from Samsung this year for a start, though they probably won't arrive until late 2017 if at all. \nMore likely, we'll see the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 , which is set to be a high-end iPad Pro rival. Huawei P10 \nBoth the Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus are now confirmed to be announced at MWC 2017. \nSpec rumors include a 5.5-inch curved QHD screen , a metal body, a fingerprint scanner and a dual-lens camera, plus potentially 6GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and an octa-core Kirin 960 chipset. HTC 11 \nWhile the HTC 11 was rumored for MWC 2017, it now looks unlikely that we'll see it there, as HTC has suggested as much , and as the company already has a new high-end handset in the form of the HTC U Ultra . \nRumors about the phone are starting to build though, with talk of a 5.5-inch QHD edge-to-edge screen, a metal body, a Snapdragon 835 chipset, a 12MP camera and a big 3700mAh battery. \nThose specs would make for a true top-end phone, but we're also hearing more out there rumors that could make the HTC 11 extra special if they're accurate. These include talk of a massive 8GB of RAM , a curved screen and 256GB of storage. \nEven more ambitiously, the HTC 11 might sport ‘Sense Touch’– a feature shown off in a leaked video , which allows you to interact with the handset by swiping or tapping the metal frame along the edge of the phone. \nPossible interactions include tapping to take a picture, or swiping to adjust the volume or change the brightness. Hello Moto (again) \nNow under the watchful eye of Lenovo, the Motorola brand has enjoyed the past few years, tearing up the budget end of the market and more recently making a convincing play at the high-end as well with its Moto Z fleet of devices. \nThere could be even more phones (and perhaps wearables as well) on the cards too with Motorola sending out a save the date invite for an event on Sunday, February 26 in Barcelona. \nThe latest rumors suggest it will be time to see the budget line of Motorola devices. Expect to hear word of the Moto G5 and maybe even Moto G5 Plus and Moto G5 Play. Everything we know so far about the Moto G5 New Nokias \nYes, you read that right - Nokia. The phone division of the famous brand is now owned by HMD, and it has sent out 'save the date' invites for an event on Sunday, February 26 in Barcelona. \nThe invite says we'll see the 'next exciting chapter' from Nokia - and while it doesn't go into detail about what exactly that means, we're hoping for a few new smartphones with Android on board. \nIt's already launched the Nokia 6 in China , and rumors of a flagship Nokia 8 handset are doing the rounds online - so we're keeping our fingers crossed for at least two new smartphones bearing the legendary name. What we know so far about the new Nokia phones Loads of other phones \nAlong with a selection of high-profile flagships we’re sure to see several low-end to mid-range phones, as well as high-end ones from less well known brands. \nHTC and LG both unveiled several handsets at MWC 2016, while Alcatel, Microsoft, Xiaomi, Meizu and HP also had phones on show. We won’t necessarily see the same selection of brands in 2017, but we’d expect a wide range of handsets will be present. \nOne company we're not expecting to see is Xiaomi, as it's apparently skipping the show. Smartwatches, tablets and more \nWhile MWC tends to mostly be about the phones, that’s not all that gets announced, with tablets, VR headsets, smartwatches and other devices also often revealed. \nThis could include the aforementioned Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 , the long-awaited Sony Xperia Z6 Tablet (likely with a new name), the Huawei Watch 2 , and a handful of new LG smartwatches . What we want to see \nWe've covered what we expect to see, but there's plenty more that we want to see and the following five things top our list. A foldable phone \nIt feels like we say this every year, but we’re going to keep saying it until it happens, and it actually might happen this year, as Samsung is rumored to be launching two foldable handsets in 2017, though not necessarily at MWC. \nThere have been foldable concept and prototype phones popping up for years and with curved displays now a mainstream thing this is the obvious next step. If a commercially available folding phone launches at MWC it could easily be one of the highlights of the show. Long-lasting batteries \nThis is the other thing we’re always wishing for, and while the occasional handset will come along that can stretch to two days of life, such phones are few and far between. \nHopefully at MWC 2017 we’ll see high-profile handsets that put a long-lasting battery ahead of ever slimmer designs. Wireless and fast charging have become more common features in recent years, but they’re no substitute for a battery that simply doesn’t need charging as often. 4K displays \n4K screens on smartphone sized displays are unnecessary for general use, but with Samsung pushing its Gear VR platform, Google launching Daydream and many smartphone makers having VR headsets of their own, it’s clear that virtual reality is going to become an increasingly big part of the smartphone experience, and when you’ve got a phone strapped to your face every pixel helps. All the flagships \nMWC 2017 will only be as memorable as the phones that make an appearance, so it would be great to see a wide range of flagships. This would also give prospective buyers a clear view of their options, rather than making them wait for other flagships to be announced later in the year, or risk missing out. An exciting Android tablet \nIt’s been a long time since the last truly exciting Android tablet, and it would be great if a real iPad Pro rival showed up at MWC 2017. \nIf one does it’s likely to be made by Sony or Samsung, as other than the Pixel C and the dormant Nexus range they’re the biggest players in Android tablets. We’re not particularly expecting one, but it would be a nice surprise. One thing we won't see at MWC is the iPhone 8 Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:20:59.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
