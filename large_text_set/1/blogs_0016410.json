And, according to several GMs, the sales pitch is that Richardson is very similar to Steelers superstar running back Le’Veon Bell.\n“I got a call from Sunday night from him,” said Bears GM Ryan Pace of Jimmy Sexton, Richardson’s agent. “He’s like: ‘Do you want Le’Veon Bell on your team?’ And I said ‘Of course I would, but you don’t represent him.’ And he said: ‘No, I represent the original Le’Veon Bell.’ Then it really went off the rails from there.”\nSexton has been telling teams that Bell should not get credit for revolutionizing the running back position by hesitating at the line of scrimmage: “My client did that from his first practice in the NFL, through a year and a half in Cleveland, the same in Indianapolis and then getting cut by Oakland and Baltimore. If hesitation is what you want, then I can get you the most hesitant runner to ever do it. He’ll stutter step at the line all damn game.”\nInsisting that Richardson was “a running back with a style before his time,” Sexton is hoping to get work for a player who averaged 3.3 yards per carry in three NFL season and hasn’t had a single carry in the past two. Meanwhile, Bell has averaged 128 yards from scrimmage per game in his first four seasons in the NFL.\n“If you think Trent hesitated at the line before,” Sexton said in a voicemail to the Colts front office, “wait until you see him now. He’s just as clueless as where the hole is, but even slower of foot. I await your call back.”\nSince you’re here … SP is an an independent site.
