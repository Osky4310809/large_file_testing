Today, the phone officially goes on sale at the company’s web site for the unlocked price of $229.99.\nSee also: ZTE Blade V8 Pro hands-on 2 weeks ago As we mentioned in our previous look at the Blade V8 Pro, the biggest feature for this handset is its dual 13MP rear cameras, with one of them dedicated to recording depth information for images. This is supposed to give you a way to put the object of your photo in sharp focus, while also blurring the background slightly.\nFor some reason, ZTE will install Android 6.0 Marshmallow on this new Blade V8 Pro, rather than a version of Android Nougat , so that could be a deal breaker for some folks. The other hardware specs include a 5.5-inch 1080p display, an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board storage, with a microSD card slot to add up to 128GB of extra storage. It will also have a 3,140mAh battery that supports Quick Charge 2.0, dual SIM support, and a fingerprint sensor embedded in the phone’s home button.\nAre you interested in getting the ZTE Blade V8 Pro with its dual rear camera feature?
