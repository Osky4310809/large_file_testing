Thanks to an influx of top chefs and innovative culinary collections—the seasonally-inspired menu at Acorn or a hodgepodge of food truck-style eats at Avanti F&B—overdoing it becomes quite easy. \nFortunately, the city that feeds some of the country’s best ski mountains and outdoor adventure towns is brimming with a popping health and wellness scene. Add these stops to your agenda for a guilt-free, feel-good trip to the Mile-High City. 1/11 Photograph courtesy of Visit Denver Red Rocks Amphitheatre \nCardio buffs should head 10 miles outside of Denver city limits to Red Rocks Amphitheatre—an open-air stadium built into surrounding rock structures. When there’s not a concert going on, you’ll find runners jogging the steps and yogis basking in the view (the Rockies and the Great Plains in the distance). Expect to be more winded than usual: At 6,450 feet above sea level, even the well-conditioned lose their breath. Entertaining signs—like ‘29 steps to go … What’s your heart rate?’—will help distract. \nAddress: 18300 W Alameda Pkwy, Morrison, CO 80465 2/11 The Art Hotel The ART Hotel’s Art Ride \nDenver’s sleek and modern ART hotel has prime real estate close to many of the city’s museums (including the Denver Art Museum and the Clyfford Still Museum). But that’s good news for the artistic and the athletic. The property’s Art Ride, a 5K route that snakes you by some of the city’s public art highlights (like a 40-foot steel bear peering into the convention center) helps you cross a workout and a museum tour off your to-do list at once. Go with a guide (by foot or bike) or take the map and do it solo. \nAddress: 1201 Broadway, Denver, CO 80203", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:55:50.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
