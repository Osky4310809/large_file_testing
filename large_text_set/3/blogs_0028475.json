Speaking while away on international duty with Belgium, the Premier League's top goalscorer hinted all would be revealed shortly in regards to his situation, per Kristof Terreur of Het Laatste Nieuws : Romelu Lukaku wasn't keen to answer questions on his future: \"The decision has already been made, so I can't talk about it.\" #EFC pic.twitter.com/YU7fk3T8JG â€” Kristof Terreur ðŸ“° (@HLNinEngeland) March 24, 2017 \nLukaku then went on to discuss the interview he gave about Everton's aspirations. \"There is nothing wrong with ambition,\" he said, per ESPN.com . \"You have to embrace it and where you are as a footballer.\" \nThe Belgium international went on to say, \"I want to help Everton as much as I can as well as the national team.\" PAUL ELLIS/Getty Images Lukaku has been exceptional this season. \nAccording to Matt Law of the Daily Telegraph , both Chelsea and Manchester United are admirers of Lukaku. Given his 21-goal haul this season, that's no surprise. \nAs noted by Bleacher Report UK, Lukaku's recent form has seen him nominated as one of the potential winners of the Premier League's Player of the Month for March: The @premierleague has named its nominees for Marchâ€™s Player of the MonthQuote tweet with your pick pic.twitter.com/EKOwKDvrKr â€” Bleacher Report UK (@br_uk) March 24, 2017 \nThe striker has gone up another level under manager Ronald Koeman. While he's always been clinical in front of goal, Lukaku has developed into the most natural finisher in the Premier League, able to score with his stronger left foot, his right and also with his head. \nThere have evidently been improvements to his all-round game, too. Lukaku is making steady progress with his back to goal, is contributing more off the ball and is making sharper movements around the box. OLI SCARFF/Getty Images Everton are making positive strides under Koeman. \nEvertonians would be delighted if his decision was to stay at the club. Indeed, the Toffees seem to be doing their utmost to match the ambition of their top scorer too, announcing on Thursday that they'd agreed to acquire the land at Bramley Moore Dock in order to build an \"iconic waterfront stadium.\" \nIt's clear, despite speculation about a potential exit, that Lukaku has the backing of the club's supporters too, as the man himself suggested on Instagram after the recent 4-0 win over Hull City : Will Lukaku be an Everton player next season?
