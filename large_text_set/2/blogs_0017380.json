Thankfully, the TODAY show personality called into her morning program to drop all kinds of deets about her adopted little one. \nMiz Kotb revealed: \n\"She's a Valentine's baby‚Ä¶ She is the love of my life.\" \nA ! And her peers, specifically Carson Daly and Al Roker , seemed pretty shocked by the baby news as they couldn't pick their jaws up off of the floor (below). \nWATCH: \"You were made to be a mom.\" @kathielgifford told @hodakotb https://t.co/UJom0hKR2O pic.twitter.com/oKKyovqFNL ‚Äî TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 21, 2017 \nObviously, Hoda's coworkers sent her only love following the big announcement as Matt Lauer noted: \n\"This little girl Haley is the luckiest girl. You're going to be one of the most fantastic moms I can ever imagine. \" \nNot to mention, the 52-year-old's TV bestie Kathie Lee Gifford added: \n\"We are thrilled for you. You were made to be a mom.\" \nHear! Hear! After getting over his shock, Daly joked: \n\"You're going to be an incredible mother. You thought you drank a lot of wine before? Just wait.\" \nNBC meteorologist Dylan Dreyer also congratulated the new mom as she wrote on Twitter : \nThere is no joy like being a mother! @hodakotb I'm so beyond happy for you!!! Welcome aboard the baby train! üíùüíùüçºüçºüçºShe's precious! ‚Äî Dylan Dreyer (@DylanDreyerNBC) February 21, 2017 \nAnd it seems the industry vet's friends aren't the only ones happy for her, as Kotb's own mother quipped to her baby girl: \n\"We've been waiting a long time for you.\" \nToo cute! In case you forgot, Hoda moved in with her boyfriend, named Joel Schiffman , just last year. She was previously married Burzis Kanga . But, sadly, in 2007 the journalist and the former University of New Orleans tennis coach divorced. They had no children together. \nNonetheless, Hoda is certainly loving being a new mom as she's since posted on social media:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:34:53.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
