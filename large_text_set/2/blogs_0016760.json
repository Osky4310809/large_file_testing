Their new album is forthcoming, but today they’re sharing two outtakes from it that were recorded at the same time: “Nobody Knows If” and “One Mississippi/Light In Through The Window” contain the same poignant emotional drive from their earlier work, seamlessly blending in the atmospheric energy from last fall’s EP. Both songs deal with the internal tensions that come with being in a relationship: the former pivots around the haunting question, “When we have kids, will we know how to love them?,” and the latter concerns itself with whether or not we’re feeling things “the right way.” And both contain the same warm melodic progressions and easygoing hooks that we’ve come to expect from the young band. Proceeds from the songs go towards the American Civil Liberties Union — you can pay-what-you-want for them here .
