Using the standard 10:1 ratio of snow-to-water, that translates to over 150 inches of snow in certain parts of the state: You see that “x” labeled 13.4? That’s right near Mammoth, meaning the resort could add to its already staggering snow total by over 10 feet. Photo: Courtesy of NOAA \nSo what does all that mean for snowboarders and skiers in California? \nFor one, it means that mountains like Mammoth could exceed their seasonal average snowfall before February — OnTheSnow reports Mammoth averages 400 inches of snow a year; they’ve already received 269 inches on the summit . \nAnd, if you give credence to Instagram postings, it means that resorts like Mammoth could potentially stay open through August of this year: A photo posted by Mammoth Unbound (@mammothunbound) on Jan 8, 2017 at 6:52pm PST \nKeep in mind that in the past five years in drought-ravaged California, seasonal snow totals at Mammoth have been as low as 238 inches . \nWe’ll be following this storm closely as it unfolds this week, so stay tuned for more updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:02:42.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
