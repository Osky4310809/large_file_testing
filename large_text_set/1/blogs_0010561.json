In his opening remarks at the White House ceremony, Obama spoke of his admiration for the vice president and close friend . “If you can’t admire Joe Biden as a person you’ve got a problem. He’s as good a a man as God ever created,” said the president. “To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without self-regard, and to live life fully,” Mr. Obama said, adding that this award was “for your faith in fellow Americans, for your love of country, and for your lifetime of service that will endure through the generations.” He later called him the best vice president America has ever had. “This also gives the Internet one last chance to talk about our bromance.” \nAnd how could we not? Just watching the clip of vice president Biden react to his surprise award, struggling to hold back tears and returning the praise to his president (with a heart “as big as that head”) is enough to confirm that the friendship between these two exceptional men is the greatest bromance of our time. We’ll miss you, Barry and Joe. (Please don’t leave us!) \nThis is the moment an emotional Joe Biden learns he is to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by outgoing President Barack Obama pic.twitter.com/wSl9GaWSyC — ITV News (@itvnews) January 12, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:36:12.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
