I think they have a great shot.” \nNo one on Swift’s seventh-seeded Tigers (11-15) had experienced district championship. VASJ (19-6) entered its seventh in a row and left with a fifth straight crown. The Vikings, who are in pursuit of their fifth straight OHSAA state championship game appearance, will next play in the Division III regional semifinals Wednesday at Canton Fieldhouse. They will face Warren District champion Garrettsville Garfield, which upset Leavittsburg LaBrae, 58-56. They will meet at 8 p.m., following the first regional semifinal between West Salem Northwestern and Louisville St. Thomas Aquinas. \nAquinas is a North Coast League rival of VASJ and part of a stiff schedule that Jerry Higgins said he thinks separated the Vikings. \n“We love the big-game stage,” the junior point guard said. “We played such a tough schedule and showed the intensity from everyone.” \nHiggins scored a game-high 21 points and dished out six assists. He found 6-8 sophomore Alonzo Gaffney on four of those assists, which led to Gaffney’s 20-point, nine-rebound effort.

He had eight in the first quarter, mostly in the first three minutes when Swift said he thought the game got away. \nIf it wasn’t Gaffney’s baskets, Will Butler ’s high-arcing 3s did it. The senior guard had two of them in the first quarter, then closed the second with another just before the buzzer. VASJ led 35-14. \nWarrensville never led. Senior guard Joseph Vallery led the Tigers with 15 points and Sha'Mar Latham added 12 in their final game.

Newlon delivered a passionate pregame speech in VASJ’s chapel before departing to Garfield Heights. \n“It really pumped us out and got us ready from the beginning,” Butler said. \nKwasniak added, “It was one of the best things I’ve been a part of. It was spectacular.” \nVASJ is 5-of-5 in district title games with Newlon on staff. Kwasniak brings in a guest speaker before each game and selected Newlon for this one. \nNewlon instructed each player to grab hands. For about 20 minutes, he told the players of his expectations from each of them. Much of it dealt with inspiring each other, Higgins said. \nThey saw Warrensville enter this gym a few days earlier and score the first 17 points to beat Gilmour in the semifinals. Higgins, Butler and Co. tried to do the same. \nContact sports reporter Matt Goul on Twitter ( @mgoul ) or email ( ).
