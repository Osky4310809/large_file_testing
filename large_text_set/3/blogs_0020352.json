With cap hits of $2.375 million in 2017 and $3.625 million in 2018, the Steelers’ investment in Alualu is not insignificant, especially when compared to the contracts they have handed out to other free agents in the past few weeks.\n\nWith this level of commitment to their new addition along the defensive line, it seems even more unlikely Ricardo Mathews will be returning to Pittsburgh. A high draft pick at the position should also be taken off the table.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:20:57.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
