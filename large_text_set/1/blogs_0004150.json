What have you let slide hoping it would help fix your trashed back? 1. Check off everything you’ve let your chiropractor get away with: Rolling me into a tight, fleshy ball and leaving me in a cellar full of other tight, fleshy balls. Putting their hand down my throat and pulling out a pair of vertebrae they said were “extra.” Having me address them only as “Serene Spine Buddha.” Suspending me from the ceiling with jumper cables and leaving me there over a long weekend. Sealing me inside a Styrofoam cube they called a sensory deprivation chamber, which was then loaded onto a plane that did its best to fly straight into the sky. Tucking my Social Security card under my C3 disc. Popping my left leg off and using it to do the walking-on-the-back thing. Filling my mouth, nostrils, and tear ducts with smoldering incense. Six months of chemotherapy. Tying each of my limbs to a different sick horse and having them struggle to pull me apart. Putting me on an all-salt diet with mostly-salt cheat days. Turning me upside down and shaking me, yelling “Let those bones loose, amigo!” Downloading my consciousness into a high-tech computer mouse and then pounding the side of my lifeless neck with it. Rubbing me down with pickling spices, filling the trunk of their car with medical saline, and making me climb in. Pony ride. Using me as a bath mat in their summer cottage. Coaxing my soul out of my mouth and spritzing it with holy water to make it sizzle. Twisting my body into the words “Lumbar’s Slave,” with my head as the apostrophe. Placing one enormous and searingly hot stone on my back, calling it “probably fucking Eastern healing.” Recording my spine’s cracking noises to blast out of their souped-up car speakers as they did donuts in the parking lot. Extracting a pint glass of spinal fluid, dropping a tab of Alka-Seltzer in, and using it to water their long-dead carnivorous plants. Threading yarn around acupuncture needles to create a maze on my back for a very clever little chipmunk. Tugging on me nonstop for a couple years until I stood a towering 8 feet tall. Hanging me in a mossy clearing. Get results Results for How Many Of These Things Have You Let Your Chiropractor Get Away With In Case It Was Part Of The Treatment? You're No Chiropractor's Fool!
