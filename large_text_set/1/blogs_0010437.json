But Big Sam, whose January transfer business rescued Sunderland from the drop last season, has his own targets in mind. \nHe has already had a £9.5m bid for Leicester winger Jeffrey Schlupp turned down.Allardyce is also keen on Norwich midfielder Robbie Brady and is hunting another striker, after being told by relegation-scrap rivals and former employers Sunderland that Jermain Defoe is not for sale.

Although Palace have yet to receive any offers. \nBenteke’s arrival was considered to a be a sign of the progress made by the South Londoners, and the Belgium international has scored eight times in 18 appearances. \nThe move from Liverpool was also a fresh start for a player frozen out by Jurgen Klopp once the German had replaced Brendan Rodgers, the manager who bought him from Aston Villa.
