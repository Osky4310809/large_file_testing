Image: AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Aside from the NBA’s current state of perimeter-oriented big men and affinity with the three-point line, giving healthy players “days-off” has become one of the latest fads in today’s game. The ongoing issue has become a heated topic over the past few weeks, as more and more teams have been resting their stars despite having no injuries. As expected, the voluntary resting has not been received kindly by many retired NBA players, particularly one outspoken Hall-of-Famer, who lashed out on the league’s latest trend. ADVERTISEMENT The NBA’s second all-time in career points star, Karl Malone, is the latest person to weigh in on the issue. “If you don’t have at least 10 years experience, get your a** playing. It’s not work, it’s called playing,” the 14-time All Star told ESPN. “Besides, tell our underpaid service members and police and first responders to rest. They can’t.” The former Dream Team member’s comments come after the Cleveland Cavaliers opted to rest their big three of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love against the Los Angeles Clippers over the weekend. The earlier marquee match up between the San Antonio Spurs and Golden State Warriors were lacking star power as well, as both teams decided to field the entire game with their bench players. Meanwhile, the league has tried to improve its scheduling in recent seasons by lessening back-to-back games and provide more rest for players. However, some coaches still opt to rest their stars—especially the aging ones—over the course of the gruelling 82-game regular season schedule.
