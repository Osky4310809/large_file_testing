My first response is a call for calm, because blocking the airport runways and takeoffs – and sometimes even blocking off the function of the island itself – is not the response to the situation,” Macron said. \nIn fact, French Guiana, one of five French overseas territories, isn’t an island at all, but part of the coast of South America and the second largest region of France. \nJournalists didn’t seem to pick up on the mistake at first either, but the gaffe was later lampooned in the French media under headlines such as: “Macron and Guiana the ‘island’” and “Macron and his blunder” . Le Parisien even published a quiz so that readers could find out if they knew French geography better than the presidential candidate. \nThe Internet went wild, too. \n“[The French] Guiana by Macron,” one tweet said, adding some (ir)relevant pictures. — 🃏 FouFou 2017 🃏 (@20RueduCirque) 26 марта 2017 г. \n\"It’s you Macron, who is a grave [situation]! You want to be the president of our country, and you think that Guiana is an island! Our French [citizens] of Guiana will be pleased,” another user wrote in the comments below the YouTube video showing Macron making the mistake. \n“He wants to become president... Go learn some geography first!” another user posted on YouTube. \nAnother Twitter user posted a photo of Macron supposedly searching for French Guiana on the web with a cover of Jules Verne’s ‘Mysterious Island’ posted just next to it. Mais où qu'est ce que c'est donc que cette putain d'île ? #macron #Guyane pic.twitter.com/MD7805S0AX — Purée Muslim † 🐸 (@PureeMuslim) 27 марта 2017 г. \nPeople also recalled previous mistakes made by French government officials. “With Hollande we found Macedonia, with Duflot Japan in the southern hemisphere, with Macron Guiana island,” a user tweeted.
