In a news release Friday, officials say people have been robbed in at least 10 separate incidents in the capital city in recent weeks. \nIn each case the male victim reached out to a woman through a networking site to set up a date. The victim arrived only to be confronted by male suspects, usually armed. \nSacramento Police Sgt. Bryce Heinlein declined to specify which websites were used, but he says they are dating sites or sites where items are sold. \nThe department suggests people meet in public places during the day.
