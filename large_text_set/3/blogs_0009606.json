Winter Storm Warning remains in effect from 5 am to 1 PM EDTTuesday... ... Blizzard watch remains in effect from Tuesday afternoonthrough late Tuesday night... * locations... eastern Massachusetts as well as central and southern Rhode Island.* Hazard types... heavy snow and the potential for blizzard conditions.* Accumulations... snow accumulation of 12 to 18 inches with a low risk for isolated amounts up to 2 feet across northeast MA.* Timing... snow overspreads most of the region between 4 and 8 am Tuesday morning. The snow will quickly become heavy with 2 to 4 inch per hour snowfall rates possible at times through Tuesday afternoon. The heavy snow will taper off to snow showers Tuesday night.* Impacts... heavy snow, poor visibility and strong winds will make for extremely hazardous travel. Strong winds will bring the potential for blizzard conditions and near white-out conditions at times. Considerable blowing and drifting snow is also expected and many roads may become impassable. The strong winds will also bring the risk for scattered tree damage and power outages... especially near the coast.* Winds... north 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 55 mph.* Visibilities... one quarter mile or less at times.Precautionary/preparedness actions... A blizzard watch means there is a potential for considerablefalling and/or blowing snow with sustained winds or frequentgusts over 35 mph, with visibilities below one quarter mile, forat least 3 hours. Whiteout conditions will be possible, makingtravel very dangerous. Be prepared to alter any travel plans.A Winter Storm Warning is issued when an average snowfall of6 inches or more is expected within a 12 hour period, or for8 inches or more in a 24 hour period. Travel will be slow at beston well treated surfaces, and quite difficult on untreatedsurfaces. Only travel in an emergency. If you must travel, keepan extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case ofan emergency. Issued: 9:21 PM EDT Mar. 12, 2017 – National Weather Service ... Coastal Flood Watch remains in effect from Tuesday morning through Tuesdayafternoon... * location... the eastern Massachusetts coastline including Cape Cod and Nantucket.* Tidal departure... a 2 to 3 foot storm surge is possible during the early Tuesday afternoon high tide cycle.* Timing... within a few hours on either side of the early Tuesday afternoon high tide cycle.* Coastal flood impacts... widespread minor with the potential for pockets of moderate coastal flooding are possible. Some overwash is likely from large waves along the ocean exposed shoreline including the Salisbury... Hull... Scituate and Marshfield areas.* Shoreline impacts... erosion is possible from wave action along ocean exposed shorelines including Plum Island and portions of the coast from Hull to Plymouth.A coastal Flood Watch means that potential exists for moderate or major coastalflooding. Moderate coastal flooding produces widespread flooding of vulnerableshore roads and/or basements due to the height of the storm tide and/or waveaction. Numerous Road closures are needed. Lives may be at risk for people whoput themselves in harms way. Isolated structural damage may be possible.Time of high total tides are approximate to the nearest hour.Newburyport tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 8.3- 8.8 13/01 am -0.2/ 0.2 2-3 none 8.6- 9.1 13/01 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 8.4- 8.9 14/01 am -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 11.0-11.5 14/02 PM 2.3/ 2.8 4-7 minor 10.8-11.3 15/02 am 2.2/ 2.7 7-9 minor 8.1- 8.6 15/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 4-5 noneGloucester Harbor tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 9.4- 9.9 13/12 am -0.2/ 0.2 3 none 9.7-10.2 13/01 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1-2 none 9.5-10.0 14/01 am -0.2/ 0.2 2 none 12.1-12.6 14/01 PM 2.3/ 2.8 4-10 minor 10.9-11.4 15/02 am 1.3/ 1.8 10-13 none 9.2- 9.7 15/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 5-7 noneRevere tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 9.9-10.4 13/01 am -0.2/ 0.2 2-3 none 10.3-10.8 13/01 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 10.0-10.5 14/01 am -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 12.8-13.3 14/02 PM 2.7/ 3.2 4-7 minor 12.0-12.5 15/02 am 2.0/ 2.5 6-7 none 9.6-10.1 15/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 3-4 noneBoston Harbor tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 10.0-10.5 13/12 am -0.2/ 0.2 2 none 10.3-10.8 13/01 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 10.0-10.5 14/01 am -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 12.7-13.2 14/01 PM 2.3/ 2.8 2 minor 12.1-12.6 15/02 am 2.0/ 2.5 2 minor 9.7-10.2 15/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 2 noneScituate tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 9.5-10.0 13/01 am -0.2/ 0.2 3 none 9.8-10.3 13/01 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1-2 none 9.6-10.1 14/01 am -0.2/ 0.3 2 none 12.4-12.9 14/02 PM 2.7/ 3.2 6-12 minor-MDT 11.6-12.1 15/02 am 2.0/ 2.5 10-13 minor 9.2- 9.7 15/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 5-7 noneSandwich / Dennis tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 9.7-10.2 13/12 am -0.2/ 0.2 3-4 none 10.1-10.6 13/01 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1-2 none 10.0-10.5 14/01 am 0.0/ 0.5 1 none 12.3-12.8 14/01 PM 2.3/ 2.8 4-8 minor 12.7-13.2 15/02 am 2.7/ 3.2 5-9 minor-MDT 9.4- 9.9 15/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 2-3 noneProvincetown Harbor tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 9.8-10.3 13/01 am -0.7/-0.2 3 none 10.5-11.0 13/01 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1-2 none 10.3-10.8 14/01 am -0.2/ 0.3 2 none 12.4-12.9 14/02 PM 2.0/ 2.5 6-8 minor 11.1-11.6 15/02 am 0.7/ 1.1 7-10 none 9.9-10.4 15/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 3-4 noneChatham - East Coast tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 5.4- 5.9 13/01 am -0.2/ 0.2 4 none 5.7- 6.2 13/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 2-3 none 5.5- 6.0 14/02 am -0.2/ 0.3 1-2 none 8.6- 9.1 14/02 PM 3.0/ 3.5 7-14 minor 6.2- 6.7 15/03 am 0.6/ 1.1 12-15 noneChatham - South Coast tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 3.5- 4.0 13/02 am -0.2/ 0.2 2-3 none 3.7- 4.2 13/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 3.6- 4.1 14/02 am -0.2/ 0.3 1-2 none 6.4- 6.9 14/03 PM 2.7/ 3.2 5-7 none 4.2- 4.7 15/03 am 0.5/ 1.0 5-6 noneBuzzards Bay - Woods Hole tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 2.5- 3.0 12/09 PM -0.2/ 0.2 3 none 2.2- 2.7 13/10 am -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 2.3- 2.8 13/10 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 3.7- 4.2 14/10 am 1.3/ 1.8 3-4 none 3.1- 3.6 14/11 PM 0.6/ 1.1 3-5 none 2.5- 3.0 15/11 am 0.2/ 0.8 1-2 noneWings Neck tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 4.2- 4.7 12/09 PM -0.2/ 0.2 2 none 4.0- 4.5 13/09 am -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 4.2- 4.7 13/10 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1 none 5.0- 5.5 14/10 am 0.9/ 1.4 3 none 4.6- 5.1 14/10 PM 0.2/ 0.8 3-5 none 4.2- 4.7 15/11 am 0.2/ 0.8 1-2 noneNantucket Harbor tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 2.3- 2.8 13/02 am -0.7/-0.2 3-4 none 3.0- 3.5 13/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1-2 none 3.0- 3.5 14/02 am -0.2/ 0.3 2 none 5.2- 5.7 14/03 PM 2.2/ 2.7 6-7 minor-MDT 3.9- 4.4 15/03 am 0.8/ 1.3 4-6 noneNantucket East Coast - erosion impacts total tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 2.8- 3.4 13/01 am -0.7/-0.2 4 none 3.4- 3.9 13/02 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1-3 none 3.5- 4.0 14/02 am -0.2/ 0.3 2-3 none 5.7- 6.2 14/03 PM 2.2/ 2.7 9-12 minor-MDT 4.4- 4.9 15/03 am 0.9/ 1.4 11-13 noneNantucket - Madaket area erosion impacts total tide day/time surge waves flood /ft/ /ft/ /ft/ category 1.6- 2.0 13/01 am -0.9/-0.4 3-4 none 2.2- 2.7 13/01 PM -0.2/ 0.2 1-2 none 2.3- 2.8 14/02 am 0.0/ 0.5 2 none 4.9- 5.4 14/02 PM 2.5/ 3.0 6-8 none 3.2- 3.7 15/02 am 0.8/ 1.3 6-7 none 2.2- 2.7 15/02 PM -0.2/ 0.3 4-5 noneFor the latest updates... please visit our webpage atwww.Weather.Gov/BostonYou can follow US on facebook atwww.Facebook.Com/nwsboston", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T04:43:40.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
