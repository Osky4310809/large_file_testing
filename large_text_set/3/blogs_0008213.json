She pretty much broke the Indian Interweb last week. If you STILL don't know who she is, you can recap here and here . \nAfter being trolled by the likes of cricketer Virender Sehwag and actor Randeep Hooda, the tables turned and people started calling out the two \"celebrities\" for their insensitive tweets. Sad, from you, Viru & Randeep, big-hearted stars. Nobody's patriotism needs certificates & hers has stamp of her father's supreme sacrifice https://t.co/6UAc98i2tH — Shekhar Gupta (@ShekharGupta) 26 February 2017 \nRandeep then took to social media to clear the air. \nWhen he was asked about his very questionable \"sense of humour\" at an event, recently, he said, \"I said do not politicise this poor girl's point of view. And then those two words were taken: For using 'poor', they said you are a misogynist and for using 'girl's, they said sexist, and I said, 'If it were a boy, I would have said the same things.\" \nWell, he might have tried to turn this into a, \"I didn't mean what I Tweeted\" chapter, but Gurmehar gave him just the right amount of shade with this tweet. \"I didn't tweet my hands did\" https://t.co/K5EHmTlJbe — Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) 8 March 2017 \nYou go girl!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:44:33.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
