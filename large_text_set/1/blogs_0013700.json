But even if you’re getting sick of the trend, watching popcorn pop at 30,000 fps will probably still delight.\nThis video was not put together by the Slow Mo Guys. It was shot by the YouTube channel Warped Perception , using a Phantom v2512: the “World’s Fastest Digital Ultrahigh-Speed Camera” according to its maker. The first bit, filmed at a more reasonable 1,300 fps but higher resolution, was shot with the Phantom Flex 4K.\nSo go ahead: watch popcorn pop. The video below maxes out at 15,000 fps, while the one up top takes you all the way to 30,000fps, where you can literally watch the kernel writhe right before it bursts a delicious seam.\n\n(via Sploid )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:11:08.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
