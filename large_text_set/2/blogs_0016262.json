Ambani, terming the users as ‘Co-founders’ of Jio, announced the launch of ‘Jio Prime Membership’.\nJio Prime Membership is an exclusive subscription based tariff plan just like Amazon Prime Membership or Flipkart First where companies provide priority support to its members along with exclusive plans. Considering the popularity of Reliance Jio and its services, here are all the details about the Jio Prime Membership.\nEligibility \nAll the current Reliance Jio members and the people who will enroll between 1 and 31 March 2017 will be eligible to get the benefits of Jio Prime Membership.\nBenefits \nReliance Jio Prime members can continue to enjoy the unlimited benefits that they currently enjoy under the Reliance Jio ‘Happy New Year Offer’ for another full year until 31 March 2018. Mukesh Ambani further added that Reliance Jio will introduce more exciting plans for Jio Prime Members.\nThe details of the plans will be available on MyJio app or Jio.com. In addition to unlimited data and calling benefits, Jio Prime Members will get complimentary access to Jio Media Services that include JioTV, JioCinema, JioMusic, JioMags and JioExpressNews.\nReliance Jio is also working with its partners to offer exclusive offers to Jio Prime Members, the details of which have not been finalised yet. These deals can be accessed using Reliance MyJio app.\nPrice \n\nThe eligible member can enroll in Jio Prime Membership for Rs 99 for the first year. Rs 99 is a one time fee that you will have to pay to enroll in the membership program. For existing Jio users who pay Rs 99 and become the Jio Prime members, they will then just have to pay a flat fee of Rs 303 per month (which translates to about Rs 10 per day) to continue using their Jio number with the same benefits of the ‘Happy New Year Offer’. That means free voice calling, free access to Jio services and 1GB/day limit on data usage. The users don’t have to pay anything for the Jio Media Services worth Rs 10,000 for one year.\nHow and Where to enroll for Jio Prime Membership \n\nEnrollment for Reliance Jio Prime will start on 1 March and will go on till 31 March 2017. The users can use the MyJio app for Android or iOS or visit Jio.com to become a Jio Prime member. They can also visit Reliance Digital, Jio Retail Store or any Jio Partner Store to enroll for the membership.\nDisclaimer: Reliance Jio is owned by Reliance Industries, who also own Network18, the publisher of Firstpost and tech2. \nThe post Jio Prime Membership: Here is all you need to know about about the latest Rs 99/year plan by Jio appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:51:15.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
