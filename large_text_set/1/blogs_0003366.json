In fact, Trudeau stepped down from the foundation three months later, in December 2014.\nOn Dec. 20 2016, the National Post reported the error. Now, over two weeks later, her office won’t answer questions about how the mistake was made or whether it will be corrected.\nBack in December, Dawson said she would question Trudeau about cash-for-access events, where people lobbying the federal government donated up to $1,525 to the Liberal party and then got access to Justin Trudeau. At the same time she declined to question Trudeau about the $200,000 donation made by Chinese businessmen Bin Zhang and Niu Gensheng to the Trudeau Foundation.\nDawson said she didn’t need to question Trudeau about the donation because negotiations around it started in September 2014, when she said Trudeau was no longer a part of the foundation. In a letter to interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose, Dawson wrote:\n“Information in the public domain indicates that the terms of the donation to the Trudeau Foundation were negotiated between September 2014 and spring 2016, after Mr. Trudeau’s involvement with the Foundation had ended. I will therefore not be looking further into the matter at this time.”\nRelated Conservatives call on Trudeau Foundation to ban foreign donations after 10-fold increase in three years Money began to rain on Trudeau Foundation once Justin took over Liberals, analysis shows John Ivison: Justin Trudeau admits to being lobbied at Liberal fundraisers The foundation received a letter from Justin Trudeau on Dec. 10, 2014, declaring his formal withdrawal from the organization. The foundation was first informed of the potential for a donation in January 2014 — 11 months before Trudeau withdrew from the foundation.\nWhen asked about the discrepancies in mid-December, Dawson’s spokesperson said “the Commissioner is looking into the matter.”\nNow the commissioner’s office won’t say if she’ll correct the error or question the Prime Minister now that she is aware he was part of the foundation when the $200,000 donation was initiated. Her office also declined to say what the commissioner has done to look into the matter.\n“For reasons of confidentiality, we cannot discuss any deliberations we may have or actions we might take about information that has been brought to our attention,” said ethics commissioner spokesperson Margot Booth.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:51:59.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
