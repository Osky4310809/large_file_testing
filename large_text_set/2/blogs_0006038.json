Between 2008 and 2012, we opened 38 stores, and in 2016 we opened nearly 100. This partnership has exceeded our wildest expectations,\" said former Murray’s owner and president Rob Kaufelt, who will remain affiliated with the business as a strategic adviser. \n“Rob’s dedication to his craft has placed Murray’s on the map among the culinary elite while also making specialty cheese more accessible to mainstream consumers,” added Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s chairman and CEO. “We look forward to Rob’s continued influence on the business, helping to tell the Murray’s Cheese story and building its brand.” \nKaufelt, who spent the last 25 years working at Murray's, said his goal \"was simply to run the best cheese shop in Greenwich Village.\" \n\"I’m proud that we’ve been able to maintain the spirit and service of a mom-and-pop neighborhood shop amidst our growth into the national market,\" Kaufelt said. \"I am pleased to pass the torch to our able staff, who will carry Murray’s into the future.” \nNeither side provided information on the financial terms of the merger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:02:00.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
