Whether it’s work-ready blazers or statement-making puffer coats, the Spanish retailer has fast fashion down to a science. But did you know Zara has outlet stores in Europe? The stores are called Lefties—inspired by the word “leftovers”—and they’re not new, either. In fact, the first Lefties opened in 1993 and was initially launched by Zara owner, Inditex, to shift last season’s stock and sell it at an even more affordable price point. Prices average about a third cheaper than regular Zara stores, so that $50 leather jacket you’ve been eyeing could cost you less than $20! But the brand has since developed a point of view of its own, offering new seasonal collections that are exclusive to its stores. Two years ago, it has even recruited new team of designers, pattern-makers, and buyers to restructure the brand, according to a 2014 Reuters report.

Originally, the outlets were based in Spain, but Harper’s Bazaar UK suggests the chain is plotting some major expansions, which could put it on the map as a huge competitor of super cheap brands like Forever 21 and H&M. There are now about 130 stores total, in countries like Portugal, Mexico, and Russia. In December 2016, they opened a store in Qatar. Loading View on Instagram One look at Lefties's newly revamped website shows the similarity to its sister brand. It offers a wide selection of oversized tops, slinky slip dresses, and a set of ever-popular chokers, all under $100. Like Zara, it even has trend-based editorials like \"Modern Countryside\" (say hello to military jackets and cream-colored sweaters) and the \"New Athleisure\" (think: hoodies in millennial pink). If you're heading to any of the aforementioned European countries, you may want to stop by the retailer for a fun (and affordable) shopping spree. But until then, here’s hoping Lefties comes to the States soon!
