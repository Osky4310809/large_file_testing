At the pre-release event of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion at Ramoji Film City, he said: “This is the biggest movie event in the history of Indian cinema and I have to say I’m amazed. This is pure dedication, pure strength and this is what I want to go back and teach.” At the event, a special audio-video on Johar’s career was screened. He said he was “stumped”. “ Baahubali , 67 years later, has beaten the magic created by Mughal-e-Azam on screen. Rajamouli’s cinema has soul, his personality has gumption and I don’t think I even have ten percent of it,” he said.

When he saw the film, he could see the potential in it. Since he believed in the film and put his name on it, we could conquer Bollywood market. Thank you, Karan Johar, for being a part of this journey,” Yarlagadda said, and added that the film wouldn’t have happened if everybody didn’t stick together for five years.

All of us are proud of him,” she said. Rana, who plays Bhallala Deva in the film, said every minute of the last five years was close to his heart. He said that he will miss working on the project and that he would like to work as Prabhas’ co-star in all the films.
