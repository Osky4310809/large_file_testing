Trump Shuns Traditional Dinner With ‘Fake News’ Media \nForty percent say the country is moving in the right direction now versus 33 percent who said it was in December. \nThis finding is consistent with polling done by Rasmussen Reports which determined there has been a significant rise in the number of Americans believing the country is on the right track. \nForty-eight percent now see the U.S. heading down the right track–up 14 percent since the election. This number is the highest it has been since the spring of 2009.   \nWhile Americans feel better about the country, a majority still are not sure about the president. Forty-seven percent view Trump unfavorably, while 43 percent hold a favorable view. \nTrump scored highest with poll respondents in the area of being “firm and decisive” with a net positive of 29 percent. He also scored well in “changing business as usual” in Washington at +14 percent and his handling of the economy at +11 percent. \nThe area of greatest weakness was “having the right temperament” with a negative 37 percent score. \n“Americans overall do view [Trump] more positively than negatively on being effective, bringing change to D.C., being firm and decisive, direct and straightforward — and perhaps most importantly, dealing with the economy, ” said Republican pollster Bill McInturff.
