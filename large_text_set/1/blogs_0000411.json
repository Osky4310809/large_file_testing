The alleged latest victim of the craze spent from 9pm on New Year’s Eve to 2am on New Year’s Day with 12 firefighters, all concentrating on his private parts. \nvia GIPHY \n“Usually in a case like these, we would be called in to help because medical facilities do not have the tools required to remove a ring from private parts,” City Fire and Rescue Department chief operations officer Samsol Maarif Saibani told The Star Online . \nThe ring was eventually removed from the man in his 30s with some very precise power tool use. How exactly he got his penis trapped in the ring is still unknown and will probably remain so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:02:20.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
