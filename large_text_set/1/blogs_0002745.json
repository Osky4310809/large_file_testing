In the early hours of confusion, the COG viewed it as a massive UIR attack or the Gorasni attacking. Only after Chairman Dalyell's announcement that the attackers were subterranean in nature did the Seran people discover they were not the only intelligent species on the planet. \nThe Locust Horde easily overwhelmed the COG on E-Day and advanced from their captured cities, moving from one city to another only leaving destruction. The war against the humans allowed the Locust to advance their technology and war effort by using stolen human technology and equipment. Destruction of Halvo Bay Edit The Locust Horde during the Destruction of Halvo Bay. \nSix weeks after E-Day, the Locust general that led E-Day, General Karn led a massive assault on Halvo Bay . Kilo Squad led by Lieutenant Damon S. Baird attempted to stop him with the Lightmass Missile in hopes that killing him would stop the Locust, but failed though they killed hundreds of Locust with the Missile and in their efforts to fire it. After a fierce fight with Karn and his mount Shibboleth , both were killed and the Locust lost their military leader. However, this was a minor victory as the Locust quickly replaced Karn with General RAAM and continued on their mission to destroy humanity. Humanity's Counterattack Edit \nBy 1 A.E., the Locust Horde was able to defeat the COG, but the humans used the Hammer of Dawn, destroying 90% of the surface and killing everything trapped on the surface within the blast zones. The Locust survived the Hammer, but were not able to accomplish a swift victory like they had hoped. Victory after Victory \" Cut off the head of the snake and the body dies. We will win this war. It's only a matter of time. \" — Queen Myrrah describing their new strategy \nWith the COG's almost apocalyptic effort in using the Hammer of Dawn to potentially destroy some of the Locust Horde's forces, the Horde returned to continue the war. Having caught humanity off-guard and having slaughtered a vast number of the human population during the first five years of the war, enjoyed the advantage of sheer numbers. With many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of the most battle-hardened Gears in the COG Army having been killed in the initial attack, the COG was forced to recruit from the infirm, the young, and the imprisoned to try to hold off the advancing Horde. As a result, not only did the Locust also benefit from an advantage in quantity of troops, but in the average quality of soldiers as well. As a result, the war went horribly for humanity, but went exceptionally well for the Locust, who seized Landown in 5 A.E. during the Winter of Sorrow , [17] and the COG capital of Ephyra in 10 A.E. It was during the fall of Ephyra that the Locust supposedly killed the COG's most prominent scientist, Adam Fenix , the father of Marcus Fenix. [18] The Tipping of the Balance Edit \nIn 14 A.E., Col. Victor Hoffman , the highest-ranking COG military leader, directly underneath Chairman Richard Prescott , devised a plan to win the war once and for all. Squads of Gears were deployed in what was known as the Lightmass Offensive across Ephyra city. Though many suffered heavy, if not total, casualty rates, a single squad of hard-bitten veterans of the war was able to break through the Locust forces and deploy a device known as the Resonator, a sonic-mapper that was, ideally, supposed to map out the tunnel networks of the Hollow. \nThe device was severely limited in its capabilities, barely mapping even a fraction of the network. Not all was lost, as Delta-One , the aforementioned squad, was able to find a new data source, located in East Barricade, that provided a much more sufficient geo-mapping of the Hollow. Upon securing the data, the squad was deployed to Timgad East to retake control of the captured Tyro Pillar , a train which held the Lightmass Bomb . Delta was able to defeat General RAAM , leader of the Locust Army, as well as his forces aboard the train, and deploy the Lightmass Bomb. This act resulted in the destruction of the entire Outer Hollow, causing incredibly high casualties to the Locust Horde and the near-complete annihilation of the entire population of the Kryll .

Re-Emergence: The Return of the Horde Edit \nDespite the Human's best efforts, the Locust proved incredibly persistent, even in the face of the most powerful weapons of mass destruction in history being delivered right onto their doorstep. The Locust continued to mobilize and rebuild their forces, determined to break the back of humanity. [21] Bolstered by the awakening of their deity, the Riftworm , the Horde launched a major counter-offensive across Jacinto Plateau, attacking the city of Jilane and butchering the entire population (sans a small group of renegades ), depriving the COG of another breeding farm . \nThey proceeded to use the Riftworm to sink several cities surrounding Jacinto City, and destroy several COG military bases. [22] Across the Plateau the COG suffered heavy casualties, mainly in the Pirnah Badlands and in several failed search-and-rescue missions in Tollen and Montevado . The Horde was also able to force the COG to abandon North Gate Agricultural Depot . However, this was just a precursor to the Siege of Jacinto , which forced the COG's hand into retaliating with a mobilization on the scale that had not been seen since 1.AE. However, most of these Locust attacks were done out of desperation; throughout the entire war with humanity, the Locust had also been fighting the Lambent, and they were losing ground in the Hollow at an alarming rate. Human slaves working inside the Hollow around A.E 15. Hollow Storm Edit \nAfter months of fighting across Jacinto Plateau, the Horde was able to lay direct siege to Jacinto City itself, having cut off a great amount of its water and food supplies. The Horde made its first incursions by attacking Pomeroy Depot, and then later Jacinto Med, though the latter was a total disaster for the Locust, who ended up having to make a hasty retreat. Nevertheless, the attacks on the last stronghold of humanity showed the COG how truly desperate their situation was; their backs were against the wall, and they had no choice but to launch a desperate all-out attack on the Locust Stronghold. \nIt was a high-risk maneuver; the odds of a payoff were understandably low, and in the likely event it should fail, it would leave Jacinto utterly and totally defenseless in case of a Locust counterattack, but if it succeeded, it could buy humanity time to regain its footing, if not end the war entirely. And thus a massive fleet of Assault Derricks, King Ravens, and Centaurs converged on the Locust-held city of Landown; the perfect spot to launch a massive grindlift assault right into the heart of the Hollow. \nThe attack did not quite go as planned for either side; the Locust, who themselves had their backs against the wall in regards to their conflict with the Lambent, were preparing a final assault on Jacinto in an attempt to take the city and sink it, to flood their old home with seawater, to kill the Lambent once and for all. For the COG's part, during the initial assault, they found themselves attacking little more than staging areas and outposts rather than the heart of the homeland of the Locust forces, but Delta Squad did manage to kill the Riftworm preventing that method of attack from working again. \nHowever, they were later able to pinpoint Nexus, the center of all Locust civilization, and in their own desperate bid to annihilate their foes, they did exactly what the Locust were trying to do: they sunk their own city in order to wipe out their foe, but before the Locust were prepared for it, resulting in much of the Locust forces being annihilated. Queen Myyrah's fate was left unknown as she escaped Nexus before the sinking, but Skorge, the new leader of the Locust Army, was presumably killed when Delta Squad destroyed his Hydra. The Horde 18 months after the fall of Jacinto Lambent Pandemic and Extinction \" You humans! Why do you think your lives are worth more than ours? Don't you realize who we are? Don't you recognize all your most admirable qualities in us? Oh yes... we are genocidal monsters! Just like you! \" — Queen Myrrah of the Locust Horde, arguing with Marcus Fenix during their final confrontation [23] \nOnly hours after the sinking of Jacinto, Locust stragglers were spotted around Port Farrall , leading to multiple battles throughout the city. The continuous fighting eventually forced the COG to look for a new home. Eighteen months after Operation Hollow Storm, the Horde had reorganized on the surface of Sera, but was a shadow of its former power. In addition, with Queen Myrrah missing for a long period of time, the Locust Horde was leaderless, causing some of the Horde to degenerate into a feral state, becoming the Savage Locust . \nOthers however acted as the Queen's Guard under Myrrah. The Locust captured the island of Azura , the last remaining COG stronghold where the COGs elite scientists were kept safe in the First Battle of Azura and captured Adam Fenix who was working on a weapon against the Lambent. Adam was capable of destroying the Lambent and Imulsion, but it would also destroy the Horde so Myrrah had Adam work on refining it so it would only affect the Lambent. \nThe Savage Locust and the Queen's Guard had multiple battles with the COG, attempting to prevent the COG from reaching and retaking Azura, but failed and engaged in the Second Battle of Azura with the COG, the Gorasni and the Lambent. Myrrah and her Tempest directly attacked the human forces, attempting to keep Adam from activating his weapon, but were defeated by the Hammer of Dawn . After the weapon killed Adam, Myrrah emerged and was killed by Marcus Fenix with Dominic Santiago 's commando knife and the weapon killed all of the Lambent as it was meant to as well as all of the Locust, making the species extinct. After the Lambent invasion, the COG would dispose of the remains of any Locust they found into mass graves across Sera. [24] Legacy Edit \nUnbeknownst to the survivors of the COG, the Locust were not rendered extinct. Instead the Imulsion Countermeasure Weapon forced a genetic evolution within them, causing the Locust 'corpses' to become covered in impenetrable crystalline shells. Unable to dispose of the bodies, the survivors of the COG dumped the cocoons into highly classified locations across Sera, most notably the osmium mine beneath Fort Reval and the gorge beneath Tollen Dam . For twenty-five years there was peace, until shortly before the twenty-fifth anniversary of the end of the Locust War, the Locust began to re-emerge as The Swarm . The Swarm crisis began shortly after as the altered Locust, now seemingly imbued with higher intelligence and improved, stronger bodies, took command of the lesser mutations, all rallied under the banner of the Speaker . From here the Swarm began to grow its numbers by abducting vast amounts of Outsiders and several groups of COG citizens, allowing them to grow a large army in a short period of time. \nFollowing the events of the battle of Tollen Dam , the status of the Swarm is unknown. Society and Culture Edit \nThe Locust Horde was a matriarchal society divided into multiple castes. The Locust Hordes' hierarchy, society and social class system is very similar to and can be compared with a bee hive. The Queen was the head of the entire Locust Horde, and led it in advancement, improvement and steadily increasing its size and power. The only known class was the Kantus monks led by Skorge until 15 A.E. The Kantus monks followed a strict religious code. The lower classes of the Horde are willing to die for the Queen, however there were field officers that were of higher intelligence, strength, intellect and power than the standard foot soldiers, and led the Hordes' military into battle. This class was an organization known as the Theron Guard . There was also the Palace Guards , whose members were the defensive counterpart to the members of the Theron Guard. The officers of the Palace Guard were the most powerful, decorated and accomplished Drones in the Hordes' military, and were charged with the defense of the Queen's Palace and of Queen Myrrah herself.
