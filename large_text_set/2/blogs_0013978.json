Could   \nThe absence of Borussia Dortmund's famous \"Yellow Wall\" didn't affect the team as they overcame Wolfsburg 3-0 in the Bundesliga. \nDie Borussen were forced to close their south stand for the match after accepting sanctions from the German FA for crowd trouble during a recent match against RB Leipzig. \nHowever, the absence of 25,000 Dortmund supporters didn't have any bearing on the outcome of the game as Thomas Tuchel's men cruised to a comfortable victory. \nFull-back Lukasz Piszczek played a key role in the win as he scored one goal and made two others. \nA Jeffrey Bruma own-goal gave Dortmund the lead before Piszczek's strike, and the 31-year-old turned provider when he set up Ousmane Dembele for the third goal.
