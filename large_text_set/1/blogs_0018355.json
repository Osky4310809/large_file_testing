I have my go to collection of feminist tees, but I would freeze to death and in all reality I think this is one of those events where fashion is fine to take a bit of a backseat.\" - Aurora James Photo: Courtesy of Aurora James See more photos of: \n\nType the phrase “feminist tee” into Google and wait for the search result to yield an interesting flurry of options—where one shirt reads, “Raging Feminist Bitch,” another is printed with, “Pro-Choice, Pro-Feminism, Pro-Cats.” Some are embellished with a gargantuan uterus and others have odd wordplay like, “Sushi Rolls Not Gender Roles.” But can’t I show my support without being an angry cat lady with ovaries who loves omakase? My Google exercise made me even more confused about what I—a first-time protester and fairly subdued liberal—should wear to the Women’s March on Washington this Saturday. \nThe only time I took to the streets to join a like-minded crowd was in college when Barack Obama won the 2008 election. Outside of Copley Square in downtown Boston, thousands of us danced and drank and celebrated with hearts full and tears in our eyes. “Yes we can” really felt like “Yes we did.” I was dressed in a Democrat blue shirt, but only by coincidence. Today, as I get ready to make the trip down to Washington, D.C., I am emotional, eager, excited, dedicated, determined but also, not entirely sure how to wear my politics on my sleeve. Before reading on, know this: I am fully aware that in the grand scheme of things, the attire isn’t important, the act is. But for me, being so visibly, vehemently outspoken about American policy is something completely different and as such, I feel as though I’m trying on a completely new skin and with that, maybe a more thoughtful, statement-making wardrobe, too. \nAfter asking a few coworkers in the Vogue office about what they plan to wear the day of the march, I received some mixed messages. One editor answered quickly via text, “My ‘Thank God for Abortion’ T-shirt by the artist Viva Ruiz, a North Face puffer, Prada combat boots, and an Issey Miyake backpack with snacks and emergency gear.” A writer replied to my G-chat query with, “I’ll just worry about wearing comfortable shoes. It’s not about a fashion statement, because the statement will be reflected in the number of people there.” Director of Vogue Runway Nicole Phelps was kind enough to share a couple of photos from two women’s and equal rights protests she went to in 1991 and 1993 in Washington, D.C. Back then, she marched in ’40s-inspired cat-eye shades. \nIn one of the pictures you can see a young girl, probably high school age, wearing a top with the boldface words, “Abortion On Demand and Without Apology.” I was immediately struck by the overtness of it. The message is unrestrained and direct, without any cliché or kitsch that we sometimes see in fashion, both on the runway and in real life (the Google results above included). \nHowever, not all of fashion’s reactions are loud or overt. Many designers are voicing their support for the march by creating subtly symbolic charitable items for women to wear on Saturday. Aurora James of Brother Vellies , Ryan Roche , and Hugo McCloud have donated all of the proceeds from the sale of their one-off line of simple sweaters and beanies to the march. Rachel Comey designed a camo jacket for the 50 women who will be in Washington on behalf of Downtown for Democracy, a Political Action Committee based in New York. The back of the jacket features the organization’s slogan, “Si Vales Valeo,” which translates to, “If You Are Strong, I Am Strong.” \nThough Comey is outfitting these ladies in a special uniform, she isn’t necessarily promoting one singular look for one singular group. As she explains, “I don’t think that it is important for the women marching to have a special outfit. I care about people gathering to show their solidarity and support for human rights.” She adds, “If they choose to wear a red baseball cap, then so be it. I just say, join us.” The designer is also open when it comes to the notion of statement tees, noting that she doesn’t “think it’s necessary to wear your feelings printed on your clothes, but if you want to, that’s great, too.” “Making art and statements to be worn has a long, powerful, and meaningful tradition. Clothing does have a power to transform and it can help you with whatever your mood or mission or aspiration is.” \nDuring the last few days, between scrolling through the “I’m a Fucking Feminist” tees and analyzing the various modes of protest dressing within my workplace and the fashion industry itself, I’ve been thinking a lot about why I’m actually marching. Of course, there are the obvious reasons: to stand up to the incoming cabinet members trying to strip women of their human rights, to send a message to the bigots and misogynists who have been empowered by our new president, and to, as our outgoing president said in his farewell speech last week, “show up.” But I’m also marching for my mother, the woman who taught me the importance of feminism and fighting for what is right, as well as the power that can come from personal style. \nOn Monday, I asked if she could FedEx me something of hers to wear to the march in D.C. She sent a small black box that contained a tarnished charm bracelet linked with trinkets from her days as a member of the high school student council, an intern on Capitol Hill, and a law student at Notre Dame (one of only several women in the class). She graduated law school the same year that Hillary Clinton did, went on to work in a cutthroat, all-male profession as a criminal prosecutor in Chicago, and later, became the first female president of the city’s Bar Association. On Saturday when I step out to protest for the first time, I’ll wear her inspiring past proudly on my wrist as we work toward a better future for all women. In the end, you may not see me in a feminist T-shirt, a limited-edition designer knit, or any shade of suffragette purple, and kudos to those who will be donning them, but I’ll be there, dressed as myself, for a momentous march toward change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:00:46.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
