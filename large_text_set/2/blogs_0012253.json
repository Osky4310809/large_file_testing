It’s very serious.” \nWhile Kobach admitted that some of those cases were legitimate, as in people who moved to New Hampshire from other states before Election Day , he insisted that some of those voters voted illegally in more than one state. \n“We do know that a lot of people did that, and we will have data at the end of the month,” he said.   \nCheck out the interview.
