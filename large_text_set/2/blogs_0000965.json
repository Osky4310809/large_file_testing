Any opinions expressed in this post are my own, and have not been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles, points, and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same). \nVia Airfare Spot there are several great deals from New York to Europe on Delta, British Airways and United right now. \nYou can fly to Zurich, Paris, or London and I’m seeing roundtrip itineraries from just $325. \nFor instance, Zurich fares are available in May. Delta’s non-stops from New York JFK are coming back at $353 roundtrip. \nI find it especially interesting — and this really underscores how great a deal this is, you cannot get the tickets cheaper than this really — the “base fares” are $2.50 in each direction, plus fuel surcharges and taxes. \nYou don’t want to credit these miles to SkyMiles if you can avoid it, since you earn based on the ticket price. Czech OK Plus will give you one mile per mile flown … \nNow, United has Zurich flights even cheaper at least when looking with airfare metasearch site Momondo . \nYou can credit the miles for these trips to Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer as nearly all United fares earn more miles this way. (This appears to be a United K fare which would earn one mile per mile flown in Singapore’s KrisFlyer program.) \nWhile a non-elite MileagePlus member crediting United flights to the revenue-based MileagePlus program will only earn 5 miles per dollar on the cost of the ticket excluding taxes , nearly all United fares earn 100% of flown miles when crediting to Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer (.pdf). That means you earn 5-10 times as many miles with Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer for your trip flying United than you would crediting to MileagePlus. \nWhile Singapore miles do expire after 3 years (not 3 years of inactivity), you can top off a KrisFlyer miles account with transfers from American Express, Chase, Citi, and Starwood . \nParis fares are available in May and again September through November starting at $381 non-stop on British Airways OpenSkies out of Newark or New York JFK and into close-in Paris-Orly. \nCheap London non-stops appear to be available as well.
