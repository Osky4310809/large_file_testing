The building's animated exterior is matched by a deep green interior designed by Marcel Wanders , and belongs to a larger scheme comprising four major developments conceived in collaboration between leading experts in real estate development, industrial design and architecture.\n\n\nThe architects achieved the twisting shape of the tower by displacing the floor plates, generating the impression of movement. Nestled between two orthogonal buildings, the Oh Residences introduce an element of playfulness and surprise to the neighborhood.\nRelated: Marcel Wanders Unveils Plant-Sprouting Swing for Droog \n\nThe interior design, inspired by Ecuadorian flora and fauna , offers diverse spaces that reference three classical elements–earth, and fire. \n\nThe areas referencing earth use authentic natural materials , while sensations of serenity, softness and tranquility dominate the spaces where air is the main motif. Contrasts that combine crafts, patterns and colors mark the spaces with fire as the thematic guide.\n\n+ YOO \n+ Marcel Wanders \n+ Arquitectónica \n+ Uribe & Schwarzkopf \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:20:11.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
