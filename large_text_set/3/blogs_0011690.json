(Twitter) \nIn another setback for Congress , that comes closely in the wake of MLA Vishwajit Rane fiasco, another party leader in Goa, Savio Rodrigues resigned today after expressing his anger in no uncertain terms at the treatment he has been handed out by the party at the highest levels. Savio has announced his resignation today on his official Twitter account saying, “I have resigned from the Congress. I am too small a voter to merit even a phone call”. The party leader is angry at the party’s decision not go to the Governor of Goa for forming the government in the state even after emerging as the largest political party in the state in the wake of winning over 17 seats, leaving behind Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) that remained number 2 with 13 seats. An hour before announcing his resignation, Savio said this on Twitter. “Alliance or non-alliance. We got enough numbers. Did we not fail to go the governor or elect leader,” he posted. I have resigned from the Congress. I am too small a voter to merit even a phone call. @OfficeOfRG @nayanchandra @sureshnakhua \n— Savio Rodrigues (@PrinceArihan) March 17, 2017 Alliance or non-alliance. We got enough numbers. Did we not fail to go the governor or elect leader @digvijaya_28 @OfficeOfRG @nayanchandra \n— Savio Rodrigues (@PrinceArihan) March 17, 2017 \nThis is exactly the line that was trotted out by the BJP when it was queried about trying to form the government even though it had been bested by the Congress in terms of emerging as the largest political party in the assembly. Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had taken too long to approach the Governor with the numbers as he could not muster up a majority in the assembly – the BJP actually did that and Manohar Parrikar became the chief minister as well as cleared the floor test. Digvijaya Singh is solely responsible for the damage of the Congress in Goa: Savio Rodrigues pic.twitter.com/JSDN7hD8g5 \n— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) March 17, 2017 \nThe party leader has also blamed Congress for having “betrayed the people of Goa” in a talk with Times Now. He added that he is a “very small person in Congress” and blamed Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh for causing damage to the party in the state. He said that Digvijaya Singh “should go and check his head as he is solely responsible for the damage of the Congress in the state.” \nMeanwhile, Digvijaya Singh has raised questions on the role of Goa Governor Mridula Sinha. The senior Congress leader said on Friday, that the Governor was being directed “not by the Constitution of India, not by the Attorney General of India, not by the advocates of India, not by the President of India but by the finance minister of India”.
