He announced this week he will debut the film at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival in April of this year. Bryant will narrate the film as well.\nIn complete Kobe fashion, he is not messing around with the quality of this film. He has brought Disney’s Glen Keane on board to animate the film while Academy Award winner John Williams will compose the music. \nIf you need a quick lesson on either of these names, Keane has animated films such as Beauty and the Beast , Aladdin , The Little Mermaid , Pocahontas , Tarzan and Tangled . And Williams? He composed the scores for Jaws , Star Wars , Jurassic Park , Home Alone, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and many more classic movies than I could possibly list here. \nAccording to AdWeek.com , Bryant said the following in a press release this week:\n“Dear Basketball is the perfect tribute to something I’ve loved for so long,” said Bryant. “Glen and John are two legends in their industries, so to partner with them on the creative process is a dream come true.”\nWhat an amazing day!! Thank you Glen Keane for the hand drawn #animation art you have created and thank you John Williams for bringing your timeless melody and soulful composition to #DearBasketball. I can't wait to debut our film at the Tribeca film festival in April. #Kobeincstudios #CreateForever \nA post shared by Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) on Mar 10, 2017 at 10:08am PST \nIt’s pretty impressive that Bryant has been able to get these legends in their own industries to work on the project, but we should expect nothing less from Bryant at this point. He demands the best in everything he does. The film will premiere this fall on SI.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T03:14:22.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
