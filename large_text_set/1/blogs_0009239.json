(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Senate Democrats launch Obamacare talkathon By Robert King â€¢ 1/9/17 8:05 PM Robert King Healthcare Correspondent The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/King-3.jpg More \nSenate Democrats on Monday started their night-long protest over Republican plans to dismantle Obamacare by imploring people to reach out to Senate leadership. \n\"The way we are going to win this fight is if millions of people become engaged,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Facebook Live. \"The Republican plan defies very strongly what the American people want. The American people have said yes, we want changes in the Affordable Care Act. But you are not going to throw 20 million people off health insurance.\" \nSanders and several Democratic senators blasted Republicans for aiming to repeal the healthcare law without a replacement ready to go. \n\"This is a fight and now it is time to step up and use our voices,\" said Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev. \"It is time to have a call to action and fight for what we believe in.\" \n  \nThe marathon of speeches on Facebook Live and on the Senate floor comes as the Senate continues debating a budget resolution that will start the repeal process. \nDemocrats are hoping to create enough pressure to get a few GOP defections and doom Obamacare repeal. The GOP has a 52 to 48 majority in the chamber, and can only afford two senators to defect. Vice President-elect Mike Pence would be able to break any 50-50 tie. \nThe Senate will continue voting on amendments on Tuesday and will hold a final vote on the nonbinding resolution later this week. The resolution sets spending levels for the next decade. \nSeveral Republicans are worried about repealing the healthcare law without a replacement. A quartet of Republican senators introduced an amendment Monday night to extend the deadline for when Senate and House committees need to develop repeal legislation. \nThe budget resolution gives committees until Jan. 27 to figure out a plan, but the amendment stretches that deadline back to March 3. The idea is to give Congress more time to get details around a replacement plan.
