You could have like a vendetta … You gotta have some consequences to stuff like that.” \nLil Eazy-E went on to stress that knowingly exposing someone to HIV without telling them should “most definitely” be considered a felony, and there should be “consequences for that.” \nHe later explained that his father, who died from complications of AIDS in 1995, came from “a different era” and likely didn’t have a full understanding of HIV and AIDS. \n“My father’s situation is a whole lot different to this situation,” he said. “That was in a different era. Where [you] probably didn’t even have a full understanding of how serious this virus was. So, that’s a different topic. Nowadays, to save these kids and to save these individuals, you gotta let ’em know … That’s a whole different ball game with my daddy. Nowadays, it’s just crazy.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
