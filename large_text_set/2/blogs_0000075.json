I'm glad it came quite early,\" Crouch told Sky Sports . \n\"I was on 99 for not that long. It was nice to get it out of the way. It's a proud moment. \n\"You look along that list and there's top players among it. I'm very proud and privileged to be among them.\" \nThe 36-year-old also became the oldest player to score 100 goals, as he dusted off his trademark robot dance celebration to commemorate the achievement. \nIn 2006 Crouch retired the celebration, saying he would only do it again if England won the World Cup, but he brought it out of retirement in the draw against Everton. \n\"I was under a lot of pressure to pull that out,\" Crouch admitted. \nFuming Mourinho slams Klopp behaviour \n\"I don't think the fans have seen it in club football. It was a bit rusty, but it was a nice feeling to score and bring it back for nostalgia purposes.\" \nIn reaching 100 goals Crouch converted 48 headers, 43 goals with his right foot and scored nine left-footed finishes.
