I didn't wake up this morning thinking, \"I really need Ed Sheeran to sing one of my favorite '90s TV theme songs,\" but I'm sure glad that's what happened. Sheeran has been promoting his new music , and while speaking on the air for Capital FM, he indulged a listener's request by putting his own spin on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air 's theme song. Not only does he know all the words (as we all do), he also makes it totally his own. I'll just be over here waiting for Will Smith 's official comment.
