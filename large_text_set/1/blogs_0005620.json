In a five-round shootout, Troy Terry scored the only goal, and Parsons took care of the rest in what went down as a 5-4 win for the U.S. \nTSN provided a look at the final save: Parsons makes the golden save in the shootout as USA tops Canada to win Gold. @CanadianTire #BigPlay #WorldJuniors https://t.co/JLvAqi0ZFz pic.twitter.com/grysEUa7OH \nBryan Hayes of TSN had high praise for the battle: 2017 will have a really tough time topping this game. â€” Bryan Hayes (@HayesTSN) January 6, 2017 \nTerry, who had the game-winning goal for the Americans in the semifinals against Russia, came through once again. Kieffer Bellows was big as well, recording two goals, while Parsons' work in the net kept things close with 46 saves. \nThomas Chabot was the best player for Canada, scoring one goal and garnering an assist while playing 43 minutes and 53 seconds, including over 11 minutes on the ice in overtime. Goalie Carter Hart also did great work despite allowing four goals, making strong saves to force the shootout. \nThe score was tied at 2-2 entering the third period, but most of the action came after that point. \nNicolas Roy excited the home crowd with a score a few minutes into the period, followed by an excellent breakaway goal by Mathieu Joseph. \nNHL Network captured the impressive score: â€” NHL Network (@NHLNetwork) January 6, 2017 \nDown 4-2, the United States bounced back with a goal by Bellows and a tip-in by Colin White, evening the game at 4-4 three minutes later. White tied Jeremy Roenick for the team record of seven goals in the tournament, per StatsCentre . \nEmily Flitter of Reuters summed up the action: USA-Canada gold medal hockey game is mind-boggling hockey right now and you should watch it. #IIHFWorldJuniors â€” Emily Flitter (@FlitterOnFraud) January 6, 2017 \nThe fun continued with heart-wrenching moments on each side until regulation ended, sending it to a sudden-death overtime period. \nBrian Wilde of TSN690 gave his thoughts on the level of play: They're trading amazing shifts. Good God this is fantastic. #WJC2017 \nThe back-and-forth action continued in overtime with plenty of opportunities for each team to end the game, but no one did, with both goalies competing at an outstanding level. \nWith no goals in 20 minutes, the sides went to a shootout. \nParsons and Hart were outstanding again in the final session, but Terry's goal was the difference. \nCanada looked like it would earn an easy win at home based on the first few minutes. The squad came out aggressively, and it paid off less than five minutes into the game. \nAs Mark Masters of TSN noted, it wasn't a surprise to see who got the opening goal: Chabot ... who else ... 1-0 ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ â€” Mark Masters (@markhmasters) January 6, 2017 \nChabot earned a point in every game in the tournament and led all defensemen with nine. \nMatt Barzal deserves a lot of credit for the score as well, beating the defense and finding a wide-open teammate, via TSN: Chabot opens the scoring for Canada after a great pass from Barzal. @CanadianTire #BigPlay #WorldJuniors https://t.co/JLvAqi0ZFz pic.twitter.com/D6g9rBF66R â€” TSN (@TSN_Sports) January 6, 2017 \nThings got worse for the United States, as Jeremy Lauzon doubled the lead just a few minutes later. \nAs Steve Carp of the Las Vegas Review-Journal noted, sloppy play by the defense contributed to the goal: Americans struggle to clear defensive zone, Lauzon intercepts, whips it past Parsons. 2-0 Canada at 8:02 â€” Steve Carp (@stevecarprj) January 6, 2017 \nThe 2-0 lead held through the first period, with the home team in control. Asa Rehman of Global News summed up the game to that point: Canada looks like a tournament team peaking at the right time. Canada leads USA 2-0 after 20 minutes. #WorldJuniors â€” Asa Rehman (@AsaRehman) January 6, 2017 \nHowever, the second-period action reflected the opposite, with the Americans coming out with momentum. \nCharlie McAvoy scored the United States' first goal about three minutes into the frame with a strong shot from the middle of the ice, as TSN showed: All confidence from McAvoy as he rips it past Hart to cut the Canada lead. @CanadianTire #BigPlay #WorldJuniors https://t.co/JLvAqi0ZFz pic.twitter.com/7ZCgiGwHhg â€” TSN (@TSN_Sports) January 6, 2017 \nAs Mike Zeisberger of the Toronto Sun pointed out, Canada wasn't helping its cause: Braincramps costing #CAN in 2nd. McAvoy goal came off a bad Cdn line change, now slapped with too-many-men minor. â€” Mike Zeisberger (@Zeisberger) January 6, 2017 \nThat penalty turned out to be costly, as the United States evened the game with a power-play goal. Adam Fox fired it from the blue line, and Bellows deflected it in. \nCanada again appeared to be in great shape with two early goals in the third period, leading to a frenzied atmosphere. Douglas Gelevan of CBC described the home-ice advantage: All four of Canada's goals tonight are from Quebecers (Chabot, Lauzon, Roy, Joseph) & it's pandemonium at the Bell Centre #WorldJuniors â€” Douglas Gelevan (@DGelevan) January 6, 2017 \nThe United States answered with two quick goals, however, and held on to force overtime. \nNeither side did much offensively from there, but Terry's goal was enough to secure the championship for the Americans. \nThe win capped an incredible tournament for the United States, featuring two victories over the host nation and a dramatic semifinal win over Russia. With next year's tournament set to take place in Buffalo, New York, the team could continue its success. \nMeanwhile, the Canadians will be disappointed with a silver medal at home but still remain the class of the tournament with 16 titles. \nThe young players on the roster showed plenty of ability over the course of the event, and many will star on NHL teams before long. \nPostgame Reaction \nTeam USA got a nice reaction after the game from 1980 Olympics hero Jim Craig: Congrats to Team USA on winning the 2017 World Junior Championship! What a game! #Proud #USA #Believe â€” Jim Craig (@JimCraigUSA) January 6, 2017 \nAs for the current competitors, it's hard not to notice Terry after coming through in the shootout two games in a row. \n\"That kid has ice in his veins,\" Bellows said of Terry, per Masters . \"I think he'd score on 11 out of 10 chances.\" \nIt was a different mood in the other locker room, although Canada coach Dominique Ducharme kept his head high. \n\"We're proud of our guys...they gave everything they had...to leave the rink empty tonight is disappointing for them,\" Ducharme said, per Michael Traikos of Postmedia News. \nIt was one of those games where neither team deserved to lose, but the Americans gave just a little bit extra to take home the gold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T08:09:51.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
