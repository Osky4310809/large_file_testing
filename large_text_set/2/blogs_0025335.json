Fans had fun with it, while film snobs took it hard.\nJust like Suicide Squad .\nI thought Academy Award winner #SuicideSquad was enjoyable...\n.\n.\n.\nTrying to get used to saying it out loud.\n— Joe Moses (@thejoemoses) February 27, 2017\nSuicide Squad: One Oscar.\nThese 5 timeless classics: None.\nWhat's more, there is not a single Academy Award among these titles. To make matters worse, Suicide Sqaud also has 100% more Oscars than all five combined . The situation is so bad that for every Suicide Squad win, there aren't any for the following.\nAnd it's probably only going to get worse, as there is an excellent chance that Suicide Squad will have more Oscars in 2018 as well.\nSEE ALSO: Oscars 2017: Full winners list\n1. Singin’ In The Rain (1951)\nLong before Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone serenaded the City of Stars in La La Land (six Oscars), Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly were Singin' in the Rain. The film followed Kathy Selden (Reynolds), an aspiring actress and ghost singer to stars. She ends up capturing the heart of movie star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), who ultimately helps her rise to fame.\nBut Singin' in the Rain — arguably one of the best musicals ever made — was only nominated in two categories: Best Supporting Actress (Jean Hagen) and Best Original Music Score. Spoiler alert: It didn't win either. Unlike Suicide Squad .\n2. Rear Window (1954)\nThis Alfred Hitchcock mystery thriller was nominated for four Oscars in 1955: Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing. Jimmy Stewart plays a wheelchair-bound photojournalist-turned-voyeur who passes time in recovery by staring at his neighbors through binoculars. Thelma Ritter and Grace Kelly co-star.\nNo one received acting nods and the film took home none of the awards for which it was nominated. It's now considered one of the best handful of films of all time, and has zero Oscars — one less than Suicide Squad .\n3. The Shawshank Redemption (1994)\nBased on the 1982 Stephen King novella, the drama — which starred Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman — follows the friendship between two imprisoned men at Shawshank State Penitentiary (one who plans and executes an escape).\nThe Frank Darabont-directed film was nominated for a total of seven Oscars, including Best Picture. Unfortunately, in 1995 it was up against films other powerful films: Pulp Fiction , Forrest Gump and Lion King .\nForrest Gump swept. Just like Suicide Squad.\n4. The Kids Are All Right (2010)\nThe heartfelt, real film explores the lives of a lesbian couple (played by the amazing Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) living in Los Angeles. Their life is upended after their kids (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson) track down their sperm donor father (Mark Ruffalo).\nIt was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay. It didn't take home any. Ruffalo went on to play a superhero, the type of movie that Suicide Squad is.\n5. The Lego Movie (2014)\n\"Everything is Awesome!!!\" about The Lego Movie — but not awesome enough for it to win any awards, not even for its title tune. It was also inexplicably shut out of the Best Animated Film category, unlike what happened to Suicide Squad in the Best Make-up and Hairstyling category.\nBONUS: Viola Davis is the first black woman to win an Emmy, Tony, and now, an Oscar for acting", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuicideSquad?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/thejoemoses/status/836033507738570752", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/iE2QkX2K.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/iE2QkX2K.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-28T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:25:14.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
