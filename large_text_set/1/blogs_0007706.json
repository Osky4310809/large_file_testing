Immediately following the premiere, episodes 3 and 4 will be available on Showtime's digital platform. \nShowtime's president David Nevins also confirmed that the series will get a whopping 18 episodes, which is ten longer than the show's first season and two shorter than the show's second season. \nIn a day and age where most shows on HBO and Netflix have merely 10-13 episodes, knowing that Twin Peaks will get 18 is fantastic. Another interesting thing to note is that, much like how the pilot episode of the series ran feature-length, this new season's premiere will also be feature-length. \nDoes this mean we'll get a whopping recap of what has previously happened in the small town or could this premiere event be setting up new mythology and mysteries? I guess we'll have to wait until May 21 to find out!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:02:58.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
