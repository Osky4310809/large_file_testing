They concocted an ingenious plan and prepared for battle, patching up every opening in their home but the front door.\nThen, one roommate coaxed the rat out with a broom while another ruthlessly smacked it down a flight of stairs. Another roommate stationed at the bottom of the stairs took one last swipe at the rodent, knocking it right out the door.\nMackin shared a video on Twitter of their victory, which has since gone viral.\n“You ladies should join the NHL,” said one user .\nOthers couldn’t help but reference the leading mouse in “Ratatouille.”\n“All he wanted was to cook you guys some dinner,” another user tweeted .\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:09:43.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
