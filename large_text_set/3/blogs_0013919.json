It wasn’t about being racially abused for Andrew but a lot of other things. \n“Now it’s not the right time to discuss those things. But I didn’t think he (Symonds) should have continued with that (incident). It should have ended right there.” \nSTITCH UP: Indians reach new pitch-doctoring low Andrew Symonds accused Harbhajan Singh of calling him a monkey in 2008. Source: News Limited \nClarke was speaking alongside Indian icon Sourav Ganguly in Kolkata in a promotional event for his autobiography “My Story.” \nGanguly was a key part of the Indian team that toured Australia in 2007-08, notching scores of 67 and 51 in his two innings in Sydney – a Test the tourists lost 10 minutes from stumps on day five. \nHe does not believe Clarke’s book will paint the fairest picture of what actually happened that Test. \n“I can guarantee you, the ‘Monkeygate’ chapter will not have its true picture in the book,” Ganguly, who was in the pavilion during Harbhajan and Symonds’ confrontation, said, “Because only a ‘Sardarji’ (leader) will know what Harbhajan tried to say. \n“I was standing next to Harbhajan Singh and I know exactly what he meant.” \nThis is not the first time Clarke has claimed Symonds took things too far in Sydney. \nIn his autobiography, Clarke penned that his former teammate was not particularly offended by what Harbhajan had said, but pursued the racism charge in order to square a ledger with India. \n“There was no great principle of racism at stake,” Clarke wrote. “I was never sure that Symmo felt deeply offended by what Harbhajan said, and he said as much in his autobiography. \n“If he had been offended? Different story. But he wasn’t so he was pursuing it for different reasons than the racial abuse law was set up for. \n“After the first hearing, I go to Symmo and say, ‘Mate, you haven’t been offended by this at all. This doesn’t bother you.’ \n“He says, ‘But I’m sick and tired of them getting away with it. We never get away with anything, but they do.’ \n“When it comes to suffering from racism in historic terms, we’re not going to be able to grab the high ground from India. So it would have been best to cop it and move on, rather than stage a fight we were never going to win.” \nLIVE stream India v Australia Test Series LIVE on FOX SPORTS.

That sparked a brief but bitter war of words between the two boards, but no charges were laid by the ICC with the BCCI withdrawing its complaint against Steve Smith for turning towards the dressing room for DRS advice on day four – a moment Smith later described as a “brain fade.” \n“What’s happening here with the Steve Smith incident here, it’s been handled in the right way,” Clarke said. “And the BCCI have handled it pretty well. Now we head to Ranchi and we know we are going to have a very good Test match.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T01:59:46.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
