Joyce Carol Oates: Christianity now ‘virtually synonymous w/ white nationalism’ Posted at 7:55 pm on January 12, 2017 by Sarah D. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nIt’s always cringeworthy when celebrated fiction writer Joyce Carol Oates tries to get real for a moment . But after all this time, she still hasn’t learned her lesson, which means she continues to bombard us with ignorant drivel like this: Those (of us) who could not believe in Christianity as a religion nonetheless believed that its tenets & ideals were noble, profound.

Virtually synonymous w/ white nationalism in many parts of country. \n— Joyce Carol Oates (@JoyceCarolOates) January 13, 2017 \nVirtually synonymous, eh? \n— Cameron w Redfern (@redfern_cameron) January 13, 2017 \n“Gross” being the operative word.
