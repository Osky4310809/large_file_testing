leader of Dallas Animal Services is the subject of a criminal investigation, a city official confirmed Friday. \nAssistant City Manager Joey Zapata said Jody Jones was transferred out of the animal shelter to a special project in Code Compliance two weeks ago pending a review of her dealings with the Dallas Companion Animal Project. \nJones, who recently received a raise, and the nonprofit organization have not officially been accused of any wrongdoing, and the group's leaders have denied any suggestion that they acted improperly. \nIn an email, Jones said the city requested she not comment on the investigation. \n\"What I can say is that my work here in Dallas has been — and will continue to be — focused on making our city a better place for people and animals,\" she said. \"I'm extremely proud that my team's collective work over the past few years has resulted in thousands of people assisted, thousands of animal lives saved, and additional resources for the people and animals within our city. \n\"That philosophy and passion for continued improvement and care for the 'voiceless' has always been at the core of all of my actions and decisions.\" \nPolice officials began looking into Jones' ties to the nonprofit late last year after Deputy Police Chief Rob Sherwin and Maj. Barbara Hobbs took over animal services. The two police commanders, who had previously led investigative police units, questioned how enmeshed the group was with the shelter, and passed on their concerns to city officials. Regime change at Dallas Animal Services; police commanders set to tackle loose dog crisis \n\"Whenever we get any information that warrants a full review, we want to do a full review,\" Zapata said. \"That means we look at it from every angle, including administrative and criminal.\" \nThe nonprofit organization, known as DCAP, has served as an unofficial “Friends of Dallas Animal Services.\" DCAP provided money for training, employee rewards, spay-and-neuter efforts and other needs and wants not covered by the city's general fund budget. \nJones served as a board member of DCAP. The city’s website even referred potential donors over to DCAP's website. \nBut no formal memorandum of understanding or written agreement dictated the terms of the relationship or how the charitable money could or would be spent. \n\"There is concern, and that's why we've asked for it to be reviewed,\" Zapata said. \nZapata said if nothing else, the inquiry shows that the city needs to have \"written agreements with everyone we're working with so it's there in black and white what our relationship should be.\" \nDCAP has been involved with the city since 2011 after it morphed out of a city task force that aimed to make Dallas a \"no-kill\" city. \nCity leaders had become more concerned about animal welfare in 2010 after a cat died after suffering for days in the walls of the shelter, leading to the transfer of the shelter's previous leader. Nearly 9,000 dogs roam southern Dallas, bites spike 15% each year, study finds \nJones took over the shelter around the time DCAP formed and has maintained close ties to the organization. She even helped hire two DCAP board members through staffing agencies and grant funding. \nZapata said he has not had any reason to review the relationship and never heard any complaints until recent months.

(Andy Jacobsohn/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nThe investigations come after Jones was under fire last year for her handling of what the mayor had dubbed a loose dog crisis. \nThe long-running issue with the dogs, both owned and stray, causes some South Dallas residents to fear going outside without a weapon for protection. The problem came to a head last year when Army veteran Antoinette Brown died after she was mauled by a pack of loose dogs. \nAfter Brown's death, DCAP helped finance a Boston Consulting Group report on the state of Dallas Animal Services. The report's findings on failures of processes and management prompted then-City Manager A.C. Gonzalez to ask Sherwin and Hobbs to lead the department's overhaul instead of Jones, although Gonzalez still defended her performance. A city audit released later also found troubles with processes at the shelter. \nCate McManus, the shelter's former top veterinarian who left the city over \"philosophical differences\" with Sherwin and Hobbs, said to her knowledge \"everything was on the up and up\" with DCAP. \nShe fears Jones' critics are engaged in \"a witch hunt.\" \n\"I know how much Jody, especially, has given to the city, and I just feel like she's gotten a really unfair deal out of all of this,\" McManus said. \nAntoinette Brown, shown in military uniform about 30 years ago, was the victim of dog mauling in South Dallas and died of her wounds. \nBut the new leadership at the shelter made demonstrable progress. Animal control officers began picking up more loose dogs while raising the live release rate — two goals that some had previously believed were at odds. \nStill, despite the apparent demotion and controversy, Jones was one of the 6,300-plus city employees who were awarded a 3 percent merit raise this fiscal year. She now earns more than $124,000. \nAnd Zapata and Code Compliance Director Kris Sweckard gave Jones a positive annual performance review. Zapata said the review is just one way to assess employees, that the evaluation is ongoing and that Jones met her narrowly defined goals. \nThe raise irked Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Erik Wilson, who represents southeastern Dallas, an area affected by loose dogs. Wilson said Jones' \"lack of cooperation\" dealing with the loose dog issue shouldn't have merited any reward. \n\"Nothing personal, just result-driven disappointment,\" he said.

(Guy Reynolds/The Dallas Morning News) Dallas police and animal control officers wrangle a dog who authorities say bit a man in the 2200 block of Lea Crest Drive in east Oak Cliff on Monday, May 23, 2016. \nStill, DCAP's leaders have been ardent supporters of Jones before and after she was pushed aside. \nDCAP President Maeleska Fletes said Jones didn't have the resources she needed to get the job done. \nFletes' group had helped fill some of that gap, buying equipment, funding programs and even paying for an employee softball team. \nThey also applied for grant funding from private organizations such as Petco, PetSmart and the Rees-Jones Foundation. \nBut a records request from The Dallas Morning News produced only one grant application on file with the city, although Fletes said they had filed other grants in conjunction with animal services. That grant application, written at least in part by former DCAP board member Rebecca Poling, lists a private email for Jones, the city's tax ID number and a request that the money be sent directly to DCAP. \nThe city has an administrative directive detailing the process for tracking, reporting and oversight of grants. But it's not clear if those procedures were followed or if Jones and DCAP circumvented such policies. \nPoling said she didn't know about any directives or procedures and said city officials were aware of DCAP's activities, at least generally. \nPoling, a staunch Jones supporter who worked with her at the shelter, questioned the motives of the investigation and said it will tarnish DCAP. \n\"There was never any ill intention on anyone's part, and to have it come to this is just really sad,\" Poling said. \nFletes defended the organization and said members had done everything aboveboard and were cooperating with the city's investigation. They turned over some documents the city had asked for on Wednesday. Fletes said she would turn the records over to The News as well. Dallas Animal Services politics still heated, but early returns show major improvement since shake-up \n\"DCAP has done nothing for us not to continue our relationship with [Dallas Animal Services],\" Fletes said. \nShe said she didn't believe the board had any conflicts, even though some serve on the city's Animal Advisory Commission. While the group has no formal powers, they do have the ears of council members who appoint them, and some have questioned in recent weeks whether Hobbs has been unfairly pushing DCAP away. \nFletes also called Jones a friend but said Jones was on the DCAP board because \"she was the one who knew what the city needed.\" \n\"That was the only reason,\" she said. \nJones' future beyond the investigation is unclear. She'll remain away from Dallas Animal Services during the inquiries. \nAny return to power seems unlikely. Sherwin left the city to become Forney's police chief, but Zapata said he's \"very satisfied\" with the police team's efforts to move the department forward. He also said he would likely push to fully implement the Boston Consulting Group recommendations, which include making animal services a stand-alone department rather than a section of code compliance. \nThe distinction would allow the city to seek a director-level leader for animal services, which could preclude Jones. \nFletes said DCAP's goal is to move forward as a partner with Dallas Animal Services with or without Jones. \n\"We're here for the city. We're here for DAS,\" she said. \"We don't have anything to hide.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:03:24.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
