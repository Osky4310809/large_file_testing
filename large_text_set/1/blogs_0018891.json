That’s just not cool But in the case of Elsie Hay Cook, you could also be setting yourself up for some serious clap back.\nThe retired schoolteacher from Texas has been knitting “ pussy hats ” for protesters heading to Washington, DC for Donald Trump’s inauguration.\nCook, a lifelong knitter, was proud of her efforts and decided to share about it with a knitting group she’s part of on Facebook So, she posted a picture of her grandson wearing one of the hats to her knitting group, “ Addicted to Knitting ,” on Facbeook.\nUnfortunately, she was subjected to a wave of negative comments about the photo, along with plenty of support.\n“I brought this on myself, never dreaming anyone would pay any attention to my attempt at humor in a Facebook group for knitters,” Cook told Vocativ .\nRather than be brought down by the concern trolls, Grandma Cook decided to push back. She posted a hilarious photo of a very tiny pair of knitted gloves with the caption, “I just finished these gloves for the president-elect to wear for his inauguration. Do they make a Priority Mail container in Size Tiny?”\nAfter being shared on Twitter by one of the women from Cook’s Facebook group, who simply wrote , “f*** him up Elsie,” the post went viral.\nBecause we’re all pretty conflicted about this new presidency but who doesn’t love a hilarious grandma with a heart of gold?\n“I never dreamed I would have caused all this stink,” Cook admitted. “I simply could not resist.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:32:51.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
