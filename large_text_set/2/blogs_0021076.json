He later paid for a congratulatory advert for me in the newspaper; it looks strange to me. This is someone that didn’t even call to congratulate me. \n“Tell the senator he is not a member of the APC. Everyone involved in anti-party activities can’t come back through the back door, they would have to go back to their various wards to reapply for APC membership cards and apologise openly. They should also do the needful.” \nHe commended the Deputy Chairman of the Ondo State APC, Mr. Ade Adetimehin, and some other chieftains of the party for their efforts towards ensuring that the APC won the election. \nMeanwhile, at a thanksgiving service held at the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew Anglican Church, Owo, on Sunday, Akeredolu promised not to disappoint the people of the state by serving them better and record more successes and achievements in the state. \nCopyright PUNCH.
