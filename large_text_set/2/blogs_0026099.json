She was 97. For many years, The Milky Way restaurant was synonymous with Adler, owing in part to her celebrity son director Steven Spielberg. But Adler herself was a near-constant presence at the quiet neighborhood eatery, and could often be found dancing among the tables during service. According to a note regarding Adlerâ€™s passing in the Times of Israel , Adler only slowed down her daily visits last year after turning a spry 96 years old. Well-wishes and memories have been flooding the Milky Way Facebook page along with older images of Adler at work in the dining room, while places like The Hollywood Reporter have run some heartfelt obituaries today. Leah Adler will be missed.
