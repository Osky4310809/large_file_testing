Besides a statement from Cross River State chapter of the party endorsing Sheriff, Governor Ayade has also openly appeared with Sheriff in public engagements. Sheriff and Makarfi \nMeanwhile, Governor Dickson who asked party leaders to accept the Court of Appeal judgment vesting leadership on Sheriff, in an interview in Abuja, said the crisis rocking the party was fuelled by the selfish desire to control the party ahead of the 2019 elections. He warned that the interest of the party should be placed above selfish ambitions. \nThe governor, who has been attacked by the Makarfi faction for turning the report of his committee to Sheriff, pointed out that it would have been wrong for his party to have done otherwise given the legal status vested on Sheriff by the Court of Appeal judgment. \nDickson pointed out that though he was not a supporter of Sheriff, he said he was compelled by the rule of law to accept him as the national chairman based on the court order and in the overall interest of the PDP. \nThe governor said it was appalling for many leaders in the party, who claimed to be democrats to treat the court verdict recognising Sheriff as the national chairman of the PDP with disdain, pointing out that such disposition would lead to the collapse of the party, if not checked. \nSheriff moves to stop Makarfi from challenging PH ruling \nIn a motion for discontinuance filed by Senator Sheriff and Professor Wale Oladipo, secretary of the party, the duo argued that Makarfi lacked the legal ground for such appeal. \nHe has, therefore, applied to the apex court for the withdrawal of an appeal filed in the name of the party by the Ahmed Makarfi-led faction. \nSenator Makarfi had in an appeal with number SC.133/2017 filed on February 27, 2017, challenged the February 17, 2017 judgment of the Port Harcourt Division of the Court of Appeal which restored Sheriff-led executive as the authentic leadership of the party. \nSheriff’s motion of discontinuance, which was filed through their lead counsel, Chief Akinlolu Olujinmi (SAN), noted that by virtue of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, Makarfi and other members of his faction were not the alter ego of the party and as such, were incompetent to institute any legal process in the name of the party.
