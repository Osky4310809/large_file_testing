Your protagonist will start as a kitten, and with your help she'll grow to be a beautiful cat. You have lots of interaction options in My Talking Angela. The most important are, of course, feeding her, keeping her clean, and putting her to bed. You can feed her lots of different things, like cookies, vegetables, and even junk food. You can also help her take a shower or brush her teeth (by manually moving the toothbrush). That said, Angela won't only eat, sleep, and take baths. In My Talking Angela you can also play different minigames so she can have some fun. You can take her shopping for dresses, wigs, and accessories, as well. There's even an album of trading cards that you can collect with Angela's help. My Talking Angela is a more complete version of the classic My Talking Tom, with more interaction options and better graphics. Without a doubt, an interesting app for those looking for the new Pou, and she's also considerably cuter.
