She directed “The Secret Garden” (1993) in English, an adaptation of a classic children’s story by Frances Hodgson Burnett. She turned her hand to the work of Henry James in “Washington Square” (1997) and has made three films with Ed Harris, an American actor. But she is notorious for her work in Polish; “Fever” (1981) and “A Lonely Woman” (1981) were banned by Poland’s communist regime, and she fled the country shortly after. Today she divides her time between Los Angeles, Brittany and Warsaw.\nExtremely hard to categorise, Ms Holland’s work ranges in style and straddles genres. She scrutinises complex, often compromised, characters and tells their stories in a broad historical context, but no two stories are the same. In recent years she has widened her filmography, breaking into television by directing episodes of “The Wire” and of the American remake of “The Killing”. Now, in a new democratic era for Poland, she has really come home and returned to her preferred medium. “Pokot” (“Spoor”, referring to the track or scent of an animal) is a present-day psychodrama about Janina Duszejko (Agnieszka Mandat), a woman in her 60s who becomes suspicious after neighbours and acquaintances are murdered in mysterious circumstances.\nMs Mandat, known in Poland for her stage work, dominates the two and a half hours. She is wonderful in her character’s deranged conviction that the murderers are animals taking revenge for being hunted (her two dogs disappear early in the film). As the police become increasingly wary of her, Janina seeks the assistance of a kindly neighbour and a geeky computer whiz to identify the animal-perpetrators. Taking place against the stunning backdrop of south-western Poland, “Pokot” blends an unconventional whodunit with questions of animal rights and human cruelty. The result is a beautiful rural thriller, the likes of which Ms Holland has not attempted before.\nThe absorbing and often funny screenplay is the result of collaboration between Ms Holland and novelist Olga Tokarczuk. It takes Ms Tokarczuk’s bestselling thriller “Prowadź swój pług przez kości umarłych” (“Drive your plough over the bones of the dead”) as its basis, though the screenplay differs in density from the novel. There, Janina is obsessed by astrology—mildly shown in the film—and Ms Tokarczuk’s fascination for and fun with psychological theory cannot, by nature, translate on to the screen. “Olga wrote the first draft of the script,” Ms Holland says, “which I took apart, critically. She was very humble about it. Turning the book into a movie together was not easy. It went through many drafts until we arrived at something understandable.”\nHow does Ms Holland characterise the film? “It certainly does not have a traditional dramatic structure,” she says. “It is something between genres—a thriller, yes, but in some ways not. I think of it more as a feminist, ecological, anarchistic tale.” In eluding an obvious category, it resembles Ms Holland’s most unsung film, “The Third Miracle”, a compelling story about the reawakening of faith in a troubled priest (Mr Harris), which premiered at the Berlinale in 2000 but which more or less vanished thereafter. “Pokot”, thankfully, is unlikely to suffer the same fate.\nIn a press conference in Berlin, Ms Tokarzcuk focused on the film’s feminism and the iniquities of hunting. “I could have chosen to write about the industrial production of meat,” she said, “but hunting is spectacular and, for me, a metaphor for the domination of the weak. It is a very male hobby. Political decisions are taken on the hunt. In ‘Pokot’, women and nature fight back.”\nYet the film is not intensely political; it is thoroughly enjoyable, if formally unusual, and poses seemingly unsolvable riddles. Three brilliant Polish women—director, novelist and actress—have brought to Berlin what might fairly be dubbed an ecological fairytale. It promises to be one of the most talked-about festival entries for years.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=", "https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=", "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170218_BKP505_0.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-15T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:57:58.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
