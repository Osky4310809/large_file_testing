He said Flynn was treated unfairly and that news reports of the conversations were \"fake news.\"\n\"The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?\" Trump said in a tweet.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll attempted to measure which narrative was more credible for Americans. It asked people to pick one of two statements that was \"the most concerning to you.\"\nThe first statement cited \"reports that Trump advisors were in repeated contact with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.\" The second cited \"U.S. intelligence agents leaking details of conversations between Trump advisors and the Russian government to reporters.\"\nOverall, 43 percent of Americans said they were most concerned about reports of the contacts with Russia. Another 39 percent said they were concerned about the leaks and 19 percent said they didn't know.\n\nHowever, people who identified with the Republican Party appeared to be much more troubled by the leaks. Some 57 percent said the leaks were the bigger concern, while 23 percent said it was the Russian contacts, and another 20 percent didn't know.\nGary Crosen, 65, a retiree from Millersville, Md., who took the poll, said he did not think it was a big deal that Flynn spoke with Russia.\n\"I consider Russia one of our friends,\" Crosen said. \"And we don't need to publicize it the way the news media has. ... A lot goes on behind the scenes that we don't see, and I don't think you need to bring it all out in the open.\"\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It surveyed 1,562 American adults, including 578 who identified as Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and 5 percentage points for Republicans only.\nYou can see an interactive view of the data in the Reuters Polling Explorer here .\nGraphiq \nReporting by Chris Kahn; Editing by James Dalgleish ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:48:41.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
