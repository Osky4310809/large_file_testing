But feel free to send this to five people who did watch “The Office” when it was on air — like everyone else on the planet. If you are at least a casual fan of the show, though, an Uproxx theory about the Scranton Strangler could leave you up all night wondering if the real killer is still out there. \nIS TOBY THE STRANGLER?!?! \nTo give you a small recap, the Scranton Strangler was a murderer who would strangle people who lived around the Scranton area (duh). \nToby Flenderson had a weird connection to the strangler in that he was on the jury for the case after investigators concluded the strangler was George Howard Skub. Toby maintained Skub was wrongfully prosecuted and he was pressured into convicting him. Toby eventually did visit Skub in jail, but ended up getting strangled himself. \nThe theory here suggests Toby is actually the strangler, and it brings up some compelling evidence. \nUproxx explains, \n— Toby has no one that loves him (as Michael has pointed out countless times)— Toby has made multiple, dark remarks about killing without a hint of sarcasm— Toby’s guilt after being ‘pressured’ into convicting George Howard Skub as the Scranton Strangler eats him up inside— The lone phone call when everyone was watching the Scranton Strangler chase at his desk doesn’t add up. Who is dialing Toby, a man with no friends, directly? Such convenient timing, as well… \nGOTCHA, FLENDERSON! \nSomeone send police back to 2013 TV so they can arrest this MONSTER. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
