Sinai, said. \nWinter ushers in the holiday season, first with Thanksgiving and then Christmas, holiday parties and New Year's. \nTop image: ((Photo/Ingram Publishing/Thinkstock) Bottom image: (Glayan/iStock/Thinkstock) \n“So, people tend to get in that festive mode and they over consume, whether it's alcohol, whether it's, you know, sweets, treats, other high calorie foods,” Blake said. \nWhile people are consuming more generally, they’re also eating things that are heavier and less healthy, instead of lighter foods that are preferred during warmer months. \n“We sort of hunker down and crave these comfort foods. Now whether or not this goes back to survival, I think you could probably make a case that it might in some ways,” Blake said. \nStockpiling calories may have been necessary for our ancestors when food was less readily available and caloric intake was a matter of survival. \n“We don’t need to, like, wrestle a wooly mammoth down to the ground anymore to get enough calories in, right? Instead, it’s like you’re just ordering the fettuccine alfredo, the caesar salad, having, you know, three pieces of bread with it, and the chocolate mousse cake.” \nTo make matters worse for our waistlines, the season’s colder air and shorter period of daylight inspire fewer people to get outdoors - meaning fewer calories burned than during other seasons. \n“So, there's a double whammy because we might be eating more calories, but we’re burning fewer calories just because the weather is not as conducive to things like outdoor activity,” Blake said. \nWhile a typically active person might ride their bike to work in the springtime, he/she is more likely to drive during the winter. \nRELATED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:26:51.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
