A life-sized bronze statue of a girl posed much like Degas's famous dancer with a little more attitude and intending to represent the future was installed on the eve of International Women’s Day in front of the Charging Bull, which itself was a renegade when it was covertly installed in 1989. \nThe 50-inch girl staring down the symbol for Wall Street is State Street’s way to urge companies to open up their boardrooms to women. The asset manager is calling on more than 3,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of more than $30 trillion through this initiative. \n“A key contributor to effective independent board leadership is diversity of thought, which requires directors with different skills, backgrounds and expertise. Today, we are calling on companies to take concrete steps to increase gender diversity on their boards and have issued clear guidance to help them begin to take action,” said State Street President and CEO, Ron O’Hanley in a press release . \nThe statue was created by Delaware-based artist Kristen Visbal, who according to the Wall Street Journal , used her friend's seven year old daughter as a muse. The statue will remain in its current location for a month, but a spokesperson for State Street confirmed that the company is seeking the city’s permission to extend its installation. Women on Corporate Boards \nAccording to a 2015 study by Catalyst, a non-profit working for gender equality, women occupied less than 20% of board seats in the S&P 500 companies. There are currently, 29 women CEOs at the helm of S&P 500 companies. (Read also: Top Women CEOs ) \nThis trend holds true even for start-ups. A survey conducted by Silicon Valley Bank found that 68% of start-ups in U.S., U.K. and China have no women on their boards and 53% have no women in the C-suite. 63% of the Chinese startups have women in leadership positions while that figure for companies in the U.S. & U.K. is 46% and 42% respectively. \nLeading into 2017, 70% startups in the U.S. had no women on their board and 54% had no women in executive positions.The survey also revealed that fundraising is more challenging for startups founded by women as opposed to those where founders are male. Hiring Women is Good for Business \nHiring women in decision-making roles may actually make good business sense for companies. A 2015 MSCI study shows that companies in the MSCI World Index with strong women leadership generated a 10.1% return on equity per year versus 7.4% for those companies that did not have adequate women representation in leadership roles. The study also found that companies that lacked gender diversity on their boards were, on average, more likely to suffer from governance related issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:58:03.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
