It’s a big time win-win. And that’s exactly what Kappa Sigma’s University of Central Florida chapter recently accomplished. \nUCF Kappa Sigma held their annual Key West Fest and broke the UCF Greek philanthropy record by raising $85,324 for the Military Heroes Campaign. Incredible! And what a fantastic charity. \nCreated in 2007, the Military Heroes Campaign honors and aids thousands of military veterans and their families in communities throughout the U.S. and Canada. Since its inception, the campaign has donated over $1,000,000 to non-profit organizations who advocate on behalf of servicemen and women and those wounded in combat.\nThe entertainment was provided by Slander and as you can see it was fucking nuts. \n\nHere are the lovely ladies who named as the Key West Festival Queens.\n\nHelping vets never looked so good. \n\nYou can find out more about the Military Heroes Campaign HERE .\n[ TFM ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T07:46:30.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
