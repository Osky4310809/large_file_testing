Boys at the back do it for Millwall \nThis was a huge effort from Millwall to reach the last-eight and their goalkeeper and right back were the heroes. Jordan Archer produced some vital stops to keep Leicester at bay. \nThe former Tottenham keeper's two stops from Shinji Okazaki were excellent. Then Shaun Cummings showed the poise and composure of a striker to score the winner at the death. \nIn contrast to his calm, his goal sparked absolute bedlam at the Den and a pitch invasion that went on for ages despite the desperate pleas of the PA announcer.

Time to move on from Mendy signing \nAt what point do you give up on a move that is proving difficult to pull off and try something else, possibly a bit simpler? \nIt was something I wondered while watching Nampalys Mendy repeatedly give the ball away in the first half. \nMendy tried four cross field passes from right to left and made an absolute mess of each one. \nHe under hit the first two to Millwall players, slipped as he tried a third time, again giving the ball away and gifted Milwall position with a final fourth attempt. \nFinally he decided to just stick to the basics and keep the ball on the ground and was much more successful in helping Leicester keep possession.

Wague survives baptism of fire \nThis was a significant test for Leicester defender Molla Wague on his debut following his loan move from Udinese. \nA bobbly pitch, hostile crowd and a difficult opponent to deal with in Fred Onyedinma. \nHe made a shaky start against the Millwall youngster, giving away a free-kick for fouling him and then letting Onyedinma wriggle clear of him to send over a cross that caused panic. \nBut there were plus points too from the Mali stopper. He was strong and confident in the air, read the game well and it was also noticeable that once he quickly found his feet he realised this was not a place to take risks and duly didn't. \nHis afternoon was cut short though when he went off with a shoulder injury after the break.

He got sent off after 51 minutes after being shown two yellow cards. Both of them could and probably should have been avoided. \nThe first came when he tried to boot the ball out of Leicester goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler's hands in a first-half.Then he wiped out Ahmed Musa on the halfway line. \nCredit to Millwall though. They didn't fold and were actually even more of a threat after going down to 10 men. \nThat says a lot about the spirit in Neil Harris's squad.

Ranieri shows where his priorities lie \nDespite seeing how dangerous it was to make wholesale changes in the last round, Claudio Ranieri ignored those warning signs at Millwall. \nHe made 10 to Leicester side for their trip to the League One side. \nOnly Demarai Gray survived from the side well beaten by Swansea 2-0. \nIn fairness to Ranieri the cup is his last on his list of priorities. \nThe Foxes are in real relegation danger in the Premier League after sliding down the table and also have the small matter of a Champions League last-16 tie against Sevilla coming up on Wednesday.
