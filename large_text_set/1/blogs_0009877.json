They are also changes that will continue our growth and success as a company. This is a very serious issue that relates to poor recordkeeping, not to the strength of Zambelli Fireworks.” \nDuring an unrelated investigation, the state police discovered the missing fireworks back in 2014 and turned the matter over to the ATF. Zambelli was apparently unaware that the fireworks were missing and has been ordered to revamp its recordkeeping system. \nMeyer’s statement continues: \n“Over the last two years, we’ve come a long way with our changes. This proves we have more to do. We worked collaboratively with the ATF to come to this conclusion. We look forward to making the necessary changes to become better as a company and as a team of experts known all over the world for the quality of our work.” \nThe Zambelli’s say this shut down will not require them to cancel any events and that they have a full calendar for 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:31:52.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
