However, Lord Alan Sugar had donated the sum within minutes in order to 'shut up' Piers. \nIn a video message, Lord Sugar said: \"£5,000 to silence Piers Morgan for a whole day on Twitter - that’s a bargain - the bargain of the century. \n\"Comic Relief send me the bill straight away I’ll pay it immediately. It’s going to be a wonderful day without that nutter clogging up Twitter with his nonsense for the whole day.\" \nSince that target was met, Piers decided to up the ante. The GMB presenter said: \"A little earlier I said I would come off Twitter for a day for Comic Relief if we raised £5,000. \n\"Within about seven minutes Lord Sugar, hovering in Florida, had posted a video to say he’d pay the whole thing to shut me up. Piers is known for having a laugh on GMB (Photo: Rex Features) \n\"So we then reset and I, in a reckless moment, said I would wear a Tottenham Hotspur shirt, which if you know my football allegiance is the nearest thing to hell imaginable, if viewers raised £50,000.\" \nUpon hearing the news, the likes of Robbie Savage, Rio Ferdinand, Kevin Pietersen, Holly Willoughby, Bradley Walsh, Jamie Redknapp and Michael Vaughan all confirmed they would donate £1,000 for the cause. \n\"My humiliation is looking far more likely than I feared when I recklessly made this pledge,\" said Piers. \nIf you want to see Piers Morgan wear an Arsenal shirt, donate here.
