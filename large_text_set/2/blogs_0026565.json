This is based on a classic New Zealand sweet that is traditionally made from condensed milk, butter, and refined sugar. If you’ve got a spare five minutes, grab yourself a bowl and try these little morsels out. Sprinkle over your favorite toppings, brew yourself a cup of tea, and you’ve got a delicious afternoon tea treat, without the fuss. Raw Russian Tahini Fudge [Vegan, Gluten-Free] This Recipe is : 1/2 cup raw hulled tahini, softened 3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted, plus 1 tablespoon cacao butter, melted (optional) 3 tablespoons brown rice syrup (see notes for sweetener options) 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon sea salt Flaked sea salt Preparation Mix all ingredients in a bowl until combined. If your tahini is particularly hard (ie, if it has been in the refrigerator), you may want to soften/warm it slightly before starting so it will mix well and become super smooth. Pour your blend into ice cube trays, and place in the freezer for around an hour or until set. Remove from the moulds, sprinkle with toppings if desired, and serve immediately (they melt quickly). Or store in the freezer in a sealed container for up to two months. Notes For a firmer result you could use an equal measure of cacao butter instead of coconut oil. Alternatively, simply add 1 tablespoon of cacao butter along with your coconut oil to help it set firmer. If you use the coconut oil only option, note that these treats do start to melt fairly quickly, so are best enjoyed straight from the freezer. If you prefer a sweeter more traditional fudge, feel free to increase the sweetener to 4-5 tablespoons. Any liquid sweetener will work well — coconut nectar, yacon syrup, maple syrup - all will just impart slightly different flavors (brown rice syrup and coconut nectar are the most neutral). You can also try making these with Medjool dates instead of liquid sweetener, which has a fabulous result in terms of taste (sweet caramelly goodness!). You'll just need a strong blender to do so, and it will work better if you make a double quantity batch so you have enough mixture in your blender to get it super smooth. Simply swap out the 3 tablespoons of brown rice syrup for 1/2 cup Medjool dates (approximately 5 dates), so in a double batch, that means you'll be using 1 cup of dates (instead of 6 tablespoons of syrup). Try out both versions (syrup vs. dates), see what you like best.
