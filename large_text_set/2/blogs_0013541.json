Giphy has teamed up with Sign with Robert to put together a ton of animated GIFs to help you learn a variety of phrases.

Each animated GIF is coupled with the phrase you’re learning, which has been reviewed by the Sign with Robert team for accuracy. This certainly isn’t enough to learn ASL on its own, but each of these GIFs works something like an animated flash card that can teach you a few things through repetition. You can find the whole collection over on Giphy’s Sign with Robert landing page .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:44:22.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
