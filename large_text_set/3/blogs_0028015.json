Going by the usual procedure, the Chief Minister of a state stays in the CM house designated to him but in the case of Uttarakhand, things are not as simple as they are for any other state in India. \nThe former Chief Ministers have believed that the official CM residence in Uttarakhand is unlucky for them and that is why both Harish Rawat and Vijay Bahuguna decided not to live there. The last Chief Minister, Harish Rawat for example, used to stay at a guest house. However, Trivendra Singh Rawat held a press conference at the official residence hinting that he may choose it breaking the jinx but can is he ready to take that risk? Only, time will tell. \nYou may also want to watch: \nBut, if the reports are to believed other party members have advised Rawat not to stay in the official CM house. Some of them have even asked him to get a shuddhikaran (purification) of the house done before moving in. Rawat is set to take more responsibility in the state and has kept as many as 40 departments including Home Ministery with himself while Prakash Pant has been given as many as 10 portfolios to handle. \nA long time Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) pracharak and Bharatiya Janata Party leader, Trivendra Singh Rawat was sworn-in as the new chief minister of Uttarakhand last week. The swearing-in ceremony that took place in Dehradun and was attended by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah .
