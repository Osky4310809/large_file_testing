Once boiling, add in the cauliflower and cook until slightly softened, but still firm, about 3 minutes. Once cooked, drain into a colander and set aside. Back in the same pot, add in the olive oil and once heated, add in the onion, garlic and ginger and cook until onions are translucent, about 3-5 minutes. While onions cook, add the cashews to a high-speed blender and process until creamy and smooth. Set aside. Then, add in the tomatoes, bay leaf and cook for about 3 minutes. Then, add in the cashew cream, chili, turmeric, garam masala, coriander and cumin. Stir well to combine and let cook for 2 minutes for flavors to develop. Then, add in broth, potatoes and cauliflower, season with salt and pepper, stir and cover, cooking for 10 minutes or until potato noodles are al dente. When done, remove bay leaf and divide the mixture into bowls and serve, garnished with parsley. Notes *Prepare while waiting for cauliflower water to boil and while cauliflower boils. This dish saves very very well in the refrigerator (and freezer!), so if you’re meal prepping for the week, this is a winner!
