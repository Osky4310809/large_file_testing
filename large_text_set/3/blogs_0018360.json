Largely considered the driving force behind bringing the Pittsburgh franchise back to relevancy, he won back-to-back Stanley Cups as a player and is now a part owner of the organization. He is widely considered one of the best NHL players of all time. 2 \nLemieux has also had a very public bout with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and even had to step away from the game in the middle of a season to undergo extensive treatment. It’s part of the reason why Pittsburgh loves him, for his fight and courage, and he reciprocates that love. That was evident when Pittsburgh 93.7 sports radio host Colin Dunlap’s daughter, Darran, was diagnosed with leukemia. 3 \nDunlap tweeted out a picture of a note and a signed puck that “The Magnificent One” sent to Darran. The bout has been difficult for the young girl, but Darran hasn’t stopped fighting. As you can see in the video below, she takes her fight very seriously and we’re all pulling for her. \nApp users click HERE to see the video. 4 my daughter's body is crushed by chemo but she won't let me carry her up steps to bed. \"I'll make it,\"she says each night-and does. so tough pic.twitter.com/4xe9VecqI0 — Colin Dunlap (@colin_dunlap) December 12, 2016 5 \nExcuse us while we wipe our eyes.
