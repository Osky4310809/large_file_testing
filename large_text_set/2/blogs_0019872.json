I have congratulated my players. \n\"This game was perhaps one of the most exciting games of the Champions League this season, exciting for the supporters,\" he continued. \"It was a great game for the supporter. \n\"I imagine everyone was happy to witness such a spectacle. — Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) February 21, 2017 \n\"We work hard to put on a show because we are passionate about football and we want to please the fans. Scoring three goals here at Manchester City is a really good show, a fantastic game. \n\"We've got 90 minutes to go, playing at home, so it’s far from over.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:16:35.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
