If he was not a talented player capable of reaching 200 games, his card would probably be marked already. Now, he has an opportunity to turn this unmitigated embarrassment into a Stevie Johnson or Michael Walters-style redemption. \nThere is no guarantee, of course, that this will be a road to Damascus for De Goey, but assuming he takes the right turn, Collingwood, too, will benefit in the long run. \nNathan Buckley, alas, is the party that has lost the most ground from De Goey’s ill-judged decision to lie about his Friday night punch-up in a St Kilda bar. The player’s ‘dog’ story — involving a pet bulldog, a toy and a door handle — did not pass the sniff test from the outset. \nBuckley is entitled to be livid with De Goey and to wonder whether he is cursed as coach. Buckley has battled injuries throughout his tenure and, in each of the past three seasons, he has encountered unwelcome turbulence on the eve of the season. A ‘Collingwood’ could be a collective noun for sudden disasters on the eve of the season. \nLISTEN TO THE LATEST FOX FOOTY PODCAST BELOW, OR TAP HERE TO SUBSCRIBE IN ITUNES \nYou know the sequence: \n2015 — Lachie Keeffe and Josh Thomas are nabbed for doping offences after ingesting an illicit drug laced with clenbuterol. \n2016 — A Herald Sun story about illicit drugs in hair testing that the coach felt distracted the playing group. \n2017 — An outbreak of fake news from a foolish young player. \nThe pressure on Buckley was enough without losing De Goey for 7-8 matches, in addition to the absences of Daniel Wells, Jamie Elliott and Levi Greenwood for Round 1, when he needed every competent midfielder at his disposal to take on the premiers. \nWhile De Goey is not Adam Treloar or Scott Pendlebury, Buckley has accumulated more pre-season injuries/suspension than is ideal for a coach whose career (as he admitted last year) probably hangs on whether his team makes the eight. Nathan Buckley and Jordan De Goey. Picture: Michael Klein Source: News Corp Australia \nHe’s had little luck. But in this instance, it’s also surprising that Buckley was willing to air De Goey’s dodgy story on Monday, when there was well-founded scepticism about the tale of the dog. Was this an act of naivety, wishful thinking, excessive trust or what? \nAs the story detonated on Monday — as only Collingwood stories can — numerous observers recalled that De Goey, when he first arrived at the club, had pledged to Buckley “I won’t let you down.” \nDe Goey, doubtless, feels terrible about his betrayal of the coach’s trust and will want to redeem himself as quickly as possible. \nThe reality, though, is that the kid won’t play for several weeks and he mightn’t be useful for the first 10 weeks of the season. The Magpies have a difficult draw early and should they falter, Bucks will already be in quicksand by the time De Goey returns. \nThe transformation of Jordan De Goey, if it takes place, could well benefit Buckley’s successor, rather than the coach who chose to believe, both in the player and his work of fiction. \nLIVE stream every game of every round of the 2017 Toyota AFL Premiership Season on FOX SPORTS.
