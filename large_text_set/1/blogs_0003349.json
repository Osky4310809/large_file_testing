Why? Because, for the City’s biggest US investment banks, back to school means bonus time — that moment when a long walk to the department boss’s office results in you being given your “number”, the figure of how much you’ve made for 2016. \nThe “comp” (compensation) figure can dictate which car bankers will be driving for the next 12 months, the holidays they’ll be having, even what school the children will be attending. \nTraditionally, Goldman Sachs comes out of the blocks first after it announces full-year profits in the next week or two. It’s the biggest-paying, ballsiest bank in town, and — some say — it sets the bonus benchmark for Wall Street rivals. \nAfter a shaky start, 2016 turned out to be a strong year for most departments, meaning bonuses should follow suit. Says one investment banker: “If you’d asked me nine months ago, you’d have got a pretty miserable response but since that horrible first quarter, things have picked up nicely.” \nFor the first time in years, bond traders should be getting decent bonuses, while the suave investment bankers advising clients on takeovers also had a healthy second half of 2016. In the bond world — stuck since the early years of the financial crisis with what one trader describes as “shite” bonuses — confidence came back with a bang even before Donald Trump ’s US presidential election victory triggered hopes of interest-rate rises and a borrowing boom. The Federal Reserve’s positive signals through much of the year gave credit investors a reason to bet again. Donald Trump named Time's Person of the Year \nAt last, bond traders aren’t cowed by feeling they’re lucky just to have a job. The old implied threat to the boss— pay me right or I’m going down the street to our biggest competitor — just might re-emerge. \nAs one veteran puts it: “In the old days, the best tactic when getting your number was always to be furious. Whatever it was, you’d say: ‘I don’t call that a bonus, I call that a tip’. You had the power to keep the boss on his toes. But then, for years, it was just ‘thank you for not firing me, sir’. This year, though, perhaps those old days might be coming back again.” \nBanks say the percentage of profits they pay out in bonuses is sharply down on a decade ago, that they’ve been through a major retrenchment since the financial crisis, and that their trading arms have cut back on the risk-taking that spurred the bonuses of old. \nBut recent profits suggest many traders should still expect some decent payola. At $2.7 billion (£2.2 billion), Goldman earned $1 billion more in its market-making division in the third quarter of 2016 than a year earlier. JPMorgan’s markets arm surged by a fifth to $6.5 billion, fuelled by a 48% increase in bond trading revenues, while Morgan Stanley’s bond income leaped from $583 million to $1.5 billion. \nSo expect a $2 million-$5 million bonus for Goldman’s trading boss Isabelle Ealet, plus more for outgoing bond veteran Michael Sherwood, co-head of Europe, who should — for the sake of appearances — beat last year’s $21 million. Morgan Stanley’s fixed-income boss Jakob Horder will also be in for a big package, as will JP’s Charles Bristow. Some trickle-down economics to boost their staffs’ pay by hundreds of thousands is on the cards, too. Jim Armitage: He ruffled feathers but London owes Goldman’s Woody \nA flurry of heavyweight mergers and acquisitions — perhaps spurred by Brexit — will be great news for the bank accounts of Goldman’s big dealmakers, including Karen Cook and Mark Sorrell — who can both bank on picking up a few million after advising on big deals such as the bumper Shell-BG merger, which completed during the year. \nPaul Baker’s team at Morgan Stanley will have pulled in big money for advising Sainsbury’s on its takeover of Home Retail Group, while Jonathan Bewes’ crew at Bank of America Merrill Lynch will have been major earners after squeezing out a top price for the other side on that deal. \nAnthony Gutman, who with Sherwood was forced to testify to MPs over Goldman’s embarrassing entanglement with Sir Philip Green’s sale of BHS, will be set for another multi-million-dollar pay cheque for advising ARM Holdings on its takeover by SoftBank. \nAt Morgan Stanley, second after Goldman in the Dealogic M&A league tables for Europe, headhunters predict top dollar for publicity-shy Irishman Colm Donlon. JPMorgan, number two for takeovers in the UK behind Goldman, had a decent year, too — expect heady bonuses for new European vice chair Isabelle Seillier and UK M&A chief Dwayne Lysaght. \nNotice how they’re all American banks in the roster? No surprise. When it comes to the bulge-bracket banks’ bonuses, Europe’s will be struggling to keep up. Deutsche Bank has been holding back in light of its US fines and Barclays is still sorting out its corporate and investment banking arm. UBS and Credit Suisse, meanwhile, may have been racing up the M&A league tables but they’re still in sackcloth and ashes where bonuses are concerned. \nBarclays is revamping its investment bank (AFP/Getty Images ) \nAs one Brit working for a US firm says: “For the last few years, US banks have been eating the lunch of European firms in their own backyard. We’re gaining market share, and the share of customers’ wallets that goes with it.” \nEven in US firms, the poor folks running — or not — stock-market flotations will not have a bonus to remember this year. Revenues have been lousy as uncertainty before and since the Brexit vote has made investors wary of backing new share sales. Pity IPO bankers like Goldman’s Richard Cormack and JPMorgan’s Nicholas Hall, whose names were on the ticket for Misys and TI Fluid Systems, two of the big pulled floats of the year. \nBut they will be in the minority when it comes to the bonus season. For most, there will be plenty to cheer about as 2017 gets under way. And the taxman, with his 40% cut of all cash paid out, should be raising a glass as well. Boutiques eye rich pickings, too \nThe UK mergers and acquisitions bonuses gold mine hasn’t all gone Wall Street’s way. \nBoutique advisory firms set up by veteran investment bankers fleeing their old institutions (and the compliance burden that goes with them) have continued to make big gains on M&A mandates. That’s undoubtedly sucked some of the big European M&A fees from the Wall Street giants. \nRobey Warshaw, which advised Japan’s SoftBank on buying ARM and the London Stock Exchange on its Deutsche Börse deal, is increasingly being joined in the rankings by Evercore, where Jane Gladstone’s team advised Michael Spencer on selling Icap’s voice broking business to Tullett, and Centerview, which is advising BAT on its Reynolds merger. \nA relatively new boutique team burst into town just before Christmas in the form of PJT Partners, where former Morgan Stanley rainmaker Scott Matlock’s long relationship with Sky led to his boutique being hired to advise on the Fox takeover. \nSays one boutique banker: “Robey Warshaw are brilliant, but it’s good that there’s some proper competition emerging to tackle their dominance on the London boutique scene.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:13:29.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
