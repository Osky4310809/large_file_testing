HipHopDX gave the LP a 4.5 rating , saying “Staples’ unassuming character clashes with some of the tales of gang exploits, but the effect is of chilling believability.” \nLast year, Staples shared the Prima Donna EP and an accompanying short film . The project was named one of HipHopDX’s best free projects of 2016/a>. \nHe also received his first plaque, a Gold certification in Australia for his work on Flume’s “Smoke and Retribution.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
