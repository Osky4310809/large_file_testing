Their priority, however, is their two children,Â 1-year-old sonÂ Brayden Â and 6-year-old daughter Taylor , he said.\nâ€œThe number one goal is to co-parent our children,â€ he said. â€œWe have to make sure we remain friendly because we have to make sure they have good parents.â€\nNearly a month after announcing their split, Tarekâ€™s lawyer revealed to PEOPLE in early January that the HGTV star filed to legally separate from his wife . PEOPLE also confirmed that Tarek is requesting spousal support from Christina.\nIn an exclusive statement to PEOPLE in December, the couple announced their split, noting an altercation that involved a gun, which prompted police to visit their Southern California home in May.\nâ€œLike many couples, we have had challenges in our marriage,â€ the pair said in the statement. â€œWe had an unfortunate misunderstanding about six months ago and the police were called to our house in an abundance of caution. There was no violence and no charges were filed.â€\nThe El Moussas, who wed in 2009 and share two children together,Â said they sought counseling to â€œsort outâ€ the relationship and decided to separate while evaluating â€œthe future of our marriage.â€\nâ€œDuring the process, we are committed to our kids and being the best parents we can be,â€ they said in the statement. â€œWe will continue to work through this process civilly and cooperatively, and plan to continue our professional life together.â€\nWhile reports that inappropriate texting played a part in the May 22 incident, sources close to the couple said that simply wasnâ€™t the case: â€œThere was never any infidelity in the marriage.â€\nThe El Moussas, who continue to work together amid their relationship issues, made their first joint public appearance on Feb. 10 atÂ theÂ 2017 Investor Summit in Las Vegas since they announced their divorce. \nJust days later, Christina thanked the â€œamazing crewâ€ that she and Tarek share on the home renovationÂ show for their hard work on season 7. â€œIâ€™ve never met a group of more positive, fun-loving, funnyâ€Ś all around amazing guys â€Ś filming 7 seasons of #FlipOrFlop has been a breeze because of them.
