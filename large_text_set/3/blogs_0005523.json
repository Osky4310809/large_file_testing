Danny Rand is slated to suit up as Iron Fist in a standalone series, and Finn Jones will be the star who gives the mystic hero his small-screen debut. The superhero drama will tell Rand’s origin tale as the orphaned boy gains his supernatural gifts and returns home to a very different New York where threats constantly lurk. Marvel’s Iron Fist will just be one part of the superhero sphere Netflix has established with other projects like Daredevil and Jessica Jones . \nOf course, there are other projects in the work. Iron Fist will preface series like The Defenders and The Punisher , but other titles could be in development behind-the-scenes. And, for the stars of Iron Fist, they know one spin-off they’d love to see get a full series order. \nSpeaking with Nerdist , Jessica Henwick and Finn Jones were asked about Colleen Wing’s place in Iron Fist . It was then the actress explained a bit about her reclusive character. \n“Colleen goes on a pretty crazy journey alongside Danny,” Henwick said. “She is very private, so I don’t think she really starts to take down her walls until halfway through the show. Then you start to learn more about her background and how she ended up in New York.” \nJones chimed in next, going so far as to say the heroine deserved a spin-off of her own. \n“Going back to the Daughter of [the] Dragons thing, I think it’d be awesome to see a television series with the Heroes for Hire and Daughters of [the] Dragon working together to take down crime.” \nOf course, Marvel fans will be familiar with the Daughters of the Dragon. The crime fighting duo was created back in January 1977 and consists of two familiar faces. The team houses both Colleen Wing and Misty Knight as they work alongside the Heroes for Hire (Iron Fist and Luke Cage) to take down baddies. \nFifteen years after being presumed dead in a plane crash, Danny Rand (Finn Jones) mysteriously returns to New York City determined to reclaim his birthright and family company. However, when a long-destined enemy rises in New York, this living weapon is forced to choose between his family’s legacy and his duties as the Iron Fist. \nMarvel’s Iron Fist was developed by Scott Buck. The Netflix series stars Finn Jones as Danny Rand, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. The cast also includes Jessica Henwick, David Wenham, Jessica Stroup, Tom Pelphrey, and Rosario Dawson. \nMarvel’s Iron Fist premieres March 17, 2017 exclusively on Netflix.
