Paul Mariner has some strong words in opposition of FIFA's plan to allocate for a 48-team World Cup. \nPallgen had spotted the podium during a walk through the Olympiapark near the Sommerbad Olympiastadion swimming pool. \n\"It's a leftover. A Hamburg-based auction house acting on behalf of FIFA could not sell it,\" Lutz Imhof, a long-time event manager at the Olympiapark, told ESPN FC. \n\"There's been loose interest in it a couple of times, mostly from Italians, but nobody ever bought it.\" \nWhile parts of the podium remain intact, others have not survived the test of time. \n\"Whoever wants it can have it,\" Imhof said. \nStephan Uersfeld is the Germany correspondent for ESPN FC.
