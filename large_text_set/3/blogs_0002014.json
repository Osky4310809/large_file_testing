(The Baltimore Sun) \nDunbar hit 15 of 19 shots from the foul line, while the Lakers (19-5) were 11-for-19. \n\"First time we played Lake in the playoffs, and it was exciting —I liked it,\" Moore said. \"It's great. We get to come back to practice, and we're not going home; that's what Coach [Jones] talks about — getting back at it.\" \nIn the teams' regular season meeting on Feb. 7, the Lakers claimed a thrilling 58-56 win with Andre Rafus the hero. He hit a game-winning 3-pointer with 15 seconds left in the fourth quarter and finished with a game-high 30 points. This time, the Poets limited him to nine points, which shared team-high honors with Tyrone Thomas and Alphonso Barney. \n\"[It was] free throws and execution down the stretch, and Dunbar played very well,\" Lake Clifton coach Herman \"Tree\" Harried said. \ntwitter.com/GlennGrahamSun", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T03:48:54.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
