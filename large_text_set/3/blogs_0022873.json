While the handset doesn’t actually appear in the short clip, there are a couple of subtle hints towards its design and functionality.\nFirst and foremost, the trailer features a man walking towards a door that has the same basic outline as the Galaxy S8 we’ve seen pose for the camera in a slew of hands-on images over the course of the past few weeks.\nBehind the door lies outer space and a planet that looks an awful lot like Jupiter (there’s even an astronaut floating around!), which, as noted by Android Central , could be a reference to the Galaxy S8’s alleged powerful VR capabilities.\nCheck it out for yourself below:\n\nA discrepancy lurks What’s strange, however, is that the date at the end of the video reads March 30. Samsung has announced that it will take the wraps off the handset on March 29 in New York, so we’re putting the discrepancy down to the time difference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:32:10.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
