The topic of Boudin’s lecture was “the politics of parole and re-entry.” \nPrior to being feted as a scholar in residence at NYU School of Law, Boudin spent 22 years in a maximum security prison for playing a primary role in a brazen, grossly bungled $1.6 million armored truck heist that killed two police officers and a Brinks guard. \nBoudin participated in the deadly Oct. 20, 1981 robbery along with members of the Black Liberation Army, a militant black nationalist group. \nShe was 38 years old at the time. \nBoudin allegedly convinced a quartet of police officers who stopped the getaway car to lower their drawn guns. Then, six armed men burst forth from the Brinks truck with automatic weapons. The armed men fired on the police, killing two of them. \nThe Bryn Mawr College graduate tried to flee on foot, but she was slow and hilariously terrible at hiding. An off-duty cop caught her in short order. \nBoudin allegedly left her infant child with a babysitter before traipsing off to participate in the murderous, failed caper. \nBoudin also survived a massive 1970 Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, in which a bomb intended for a dance for soldiers in New Jersey went off prematurely and killed three people. \nBharara, the fired U.S. attorney general who has now joined the NYU School of Law in the same “scholar-in-residence” role as a convicted terrorist, expressed enthusiasm about the new role. \n“I am honored to join the NYU School of Law, one of the great educational institutions in America, and I welcome the chance to contribute in such a thoughtful setting,” Bharara said in the NYU press release. “I am thrilled for this opportunity to continue addressing the issues I so deeply care about — criminal and social justice, honest government, national security, civil rights, and corporate accountability, to name a few.” This is one way I plan to keep working hard on important issues I care about @nyulaw pic.twitter.com/I0QjREV2Oy \n— Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) March 21, 2017 \nBack in December, Trump — as president-elect — had told Bharara that he wanted Bharara to continue serving as a U.S. attorney. \nEarlier this month, however, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered 46 U.S. attorneys, including Bharara, to resign. \nBharara opted not to resign. \nTrump then fired Bharara on March 11. \nBharara is a 1993 graduate of Columbia Law School. \nBoudin is currently an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work . She is also the co-director of the Center for Justice at the Ivy League school. (RELATED: Weather Underground Killer Kathy Boudin Now Works For Two Manhattan Universities) \nBoudin’s glowing Columbia University School of Social Work biography makes no mention of her bumbling failure as a getaway driver or her role in the brutal murders of three people. \nBoudin’s time as a Sheinberg Scholar-in-Residence at the NYU School of Law does not appear to have lasted beyond 2013. \nStrangely, the NYU Law page describing Boudin fails to mention her past as a domestic terrorist or her status as a parolee. \nJohn Hanchar, the nephew of slain police officer Edward O’Grady, reminded the New York Post that “nine children grew up without their dads because of” Boudin’s actions. \nAfter she failed embarrassingly in her getaway-driver role, Boudin hired prominent leftist attorney Leonard Weinglass and copped a plea to felony murder and robbery. She spent 22 years in a maximum security prison before her parole in 2003. \nThe estimated cost for a single year of tuition, fees and living expenses at New York University Law School is $89,342 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:38:34.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
