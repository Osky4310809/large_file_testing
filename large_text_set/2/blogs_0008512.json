He's currently in hiding \nJulian is under the protection of the embassy, which has granted him asylum and recognised that he risks extradition to the United States for his publishing activities with WikiLeaks. \nPamela was last seen at Julian's home on January 21st, which was around a month after she had previously visited him.
