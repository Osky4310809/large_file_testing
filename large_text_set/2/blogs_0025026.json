Occupying the top spot in the Panamera range , the Turbo S E-Hybrid is available in two wheelbases – regular (2,950 mm) and longer Executive (3,100 mm). \nIs it fast? Certainly. Instead of the 2.9 litre V6 in the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid , there’s a 4.0 litre biturbo V8 (550 hp/770 Nm) in the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid. Coupled to a 136 hp electric motor, the total system output is 680 hp and 850 Nm, which is a lot more than the other hybrid model’s 462 hp and 700 Nm. \nThe car uses an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission as well as the adaptive all-wheel drive system Porsche Traction Management (PTM) to make sure all that power is put to good use and it is. Zero to 100 km/h takes just 3.4 seconds and the top speed is 310 km/h, making it faster than a Panamera Turbo with the Sport Chrono Package (3.6 seconds/306 km/h). \nShould you prefer a greener style of driving, the Turbo S E-Hybrid can drive on fully electric power for up to 50 km, thanks to the liquid-cooled 14.1 kWh lithium-ion battery that supplies power to the electric motor. \nRecharging the battery with a 10 A/230 V connection will take about six hours, but this can be hastened by using the optional 7.2 kW on-board charger and a 32 A/230 V connection, which brings the charging time down to just 2.4 hours. \nBy default, the car starts in the purely electric ‘E-Power’ mode but should you depress the accelerator pedal pass a certain point, or when the battery charge level falls below a certain value, the car switches to ‘Hybrid Auto’ mode. In this mode, both the V8 comes to life to work with the electric motor. Porsche says the Turbo S E-Hybrid has a NEDC-certified fuel consumption of just 2.9l/100 km. \nDespite its performance capabilities, the new Panamera model hasn’t forgotten how to be a comfortable, long distance cruiser. Therefore, it comes with three-chamber air suspension including Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), auxiliary air-conditioning for when the batteries are charging as well as the usual plethora of leather upholstery, massaging seats and the lot. \nStandard equipment also includes Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB), Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control Sport (PDCC Sport) including Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus), Power Steering Plus and 21-inch alloy wheels in the 911 Turbo Design. The Executive version comes equipped with rear axle steering as well.
