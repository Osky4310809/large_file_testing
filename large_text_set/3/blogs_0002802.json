For example, social isolation has been compared to obesity in terms of potential association with negative health effects.\nIt’s not the first time scientific research has linked sadness and social media.\nMore than 79 percent of the users who describe themselves as “lonely” disclosed personal information, such as their favorite books and movies, compared with less than 65 percent of other users, according to a 2014 study published by researchers at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia, which will appear in the July issue of the journal, “Computers in Human Behavior.” The study analyzed Facebook postings of more than 600 women — half of them described themselves as “lonely.”\nWhat’s more, nearly 98 percent of the lonely users shared their relationship status publicly on Facebook instead of restricting it to just friends, and they even publicly shared their home address online, according to the study’s authors, associate professor Yeslam Al-Saggaf and lecture Sharon Neilson from CSU’s School of Computing and Mathematics. People who don’t explicitly state that they’re lonely on Facebook (though some might be) tend to share more about subjects like religion and politics, the study found.\n‘It’s a never-ending quest to be interesting and intellectual and unique, and strive to prove something to the world. You can’t just be yourself.’\nOf course, social media is also a boon for people who feel isolated. “It makes sense that the people who felt lonely would disclose this type of information,” Al-Saggaf says. “They want to make it easier for others to initiate contact with them, which may help them overcome their feelings of loneliness.”\nBut over-dependence on social networks as a social outlet can also lead to what some doctors call “Facebook Depression,” according to a 2010 report, “The Impact of Social Media on Children, Adolescents and Family,” by the American Academy of Pediatrics. (A spokesman for Facebook pointed to its own research that shows connecting with friends online improves wellbeing .)\nDon’t miss: This is one person you should never unfriend on Facebook \nRich DeNagel, a former high school teacher in his 40s who’s currently on disability, says he went off Facebook for several months because it made him feel depressed.\n“For the most part I feel Facebook is a lonely experience. You don’t often see people putting out that they’re going through a hard time,” he says. “There’s a lot of social pressure to show that everything’s great. It’s a never-ending quest to be interesting and intellectual and unique, and strive to prove something to the world. You can’t just be yourself.”\nIt was a particularly bad year for those who wanted to avoid stressful subjects online. In the months leading up to the U.S. presidential election, political arguments were raging on Facebook. And they often result in the unkindest cut of all — unfriending. The biggest social network on the planet has said that the 2016 presidential election alone has generated over 5.3 billion posts , likes, comments, and shares, with nearly 110 million Americans participating in the online debate between January and October this year.\nThat said, sharing images on social media can have a positive impact on the networkers. It exposes people to the lives of others, their good times and bad times, says Tracy Packiam Alloway, associate professor at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville and co-author of another study, “Is Facebook Linked to Selfishness?” Never before in history have people who feel alone been able to talk to hundreds, even thousands of people with a single picture, adds Julie Hanks, owner and executive director of Wasatch Family Therapy in Salt Lake City.\nFor some, there’s too much bragging online. DeNagel, who has a higher than average 500 friends on Facebook (768, to be exact), says the social network is useful for keeping in touch with people with whom he might otherwise have lost touch, but he still treads carefully with his online footprint.\n“It makes me feel more lonely,” he says. “I don’t want to take a selfie every day and change my picture or tell everyone what my inner thoughts are because maybe I’m a bit more private. But I’m sure there is a group for people who are lonely and depressed , if I went to look for it.”\n  This article originally appeared on Marketwatch .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:27:59.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
