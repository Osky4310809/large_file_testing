Today Bungie let us know exactly what will carry over. The company wants Destiny 2 to be a fresh start for players. To that end, we won’t be able to take power, possessions, and Eververse-related items and currency to the new game. \nBungie posted the info on their blog earlier today. “Sequels represent the start of a new adventure for every player, with new worlds to explore, new stories to tell, new powers to acquire, new loot to earn, and much more.“This led us to a decision that would enable us to serve both the game and the player’s best interests: Destiny 1 power, possessions, and Eververse-related items and currency will not carry forward. They will, however, remain accessible to you in Destiny 1 .” \nSo, what will you be able to take to Destiny 2 ? Bungie wrote about that as well, saying that character personalization will be transportable, but you’ll have to have reached Level 20 and completed the Black Garden mission. Bungie said: \n“We know that, just like us, you have grown fond of the Guardians you’ve created, so we do plan to preserve your character personalization. We are going to recognize the dedication and passion you’ve shown for this world. Specifically, the class, race, gender, face, hair, and marking selections for all characters that have achieved Level 20 and completed the Black Garden story mission will carry forward. We also plan to award those veteran accounts with honors that reflect your Destiny 1 accomplishments.” \nFans wanting more information should check out what Bungie is doing next Wednesday. “We’re planning to reveal the final live event for the Destiny 1 era next Wednesday,” the blog post said. “We’re calling it “ Age of Triumph ,” and we intend for it to be a fun and memorable celebration that will bring the first major chapter of our Destiny adventures to a fitting close. We’ll look back upon the three incredible years we’ve shared as a community, and look ahead to some final challenges and rewards that await you in the weeks ahead.” \nHow do you guys feel about this? Are you okay with losing some of the work you put into your Guardians? Are you okay with a fresh start?
