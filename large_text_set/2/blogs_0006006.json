She not only looked sophisticated and — dare we say it — regal , but she also inspired us to rethink our go-to spring rompers and skirts.\nAttending the New York City premiere of the sixth and final season of Girls , Williams walked the red carpet with her co-stars — Lena Dunham, Zosia Mamet, and Jemima Kirke — wearing a split-front black off-the-shoulder gown and crisp white trousers by Gabriela Hearst.\nStanding with her feet together and arms relaxed, her sleek white pants were barely visible beneath her cape-like gown.
