For years, enthusiasts have been sprinkling in coconut oil as a hydrating substitute to epson salts, which we've been behind for years. But, as one woman learned, there can be too much of a good thing. Imgur user denshan found out the hard way. It started out innocently enough: She was feeling sick, tired, and in need of a pick-me-up, so she hopped in for a bath and poured in a heavy hand of coconut oil. But once the water drained, she was stuck — literally. Unable to stand, sit, or crawl her way out, she posted to the social account to document the experience. I am currently stuck in a bath As you can see, the copious amounts of oil are lining the tub and her legs. “Went to get out after pulling the plug and I just slide around like a giant greased up potato in a roasting dish,\" she captioned the post. \"There is no traction. No grip. Just me...slipping around covered in oil.\" In reality, we all know the struggle of using too much product — and it's easy to go overboard with oils. Luckily, Denshan eventually did make her way out of the tub with a few splashes of water and closet cleaner. We'd be willing to bet she won't be touching a jar of coconut oil for some time. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:55:22.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
