Woods' fame 'unfathomable' \nMcIlroy says that he does not envy the profile of fellow former world number one Tiger Woods. \nMcIlroy lives in Florida, USA and regularly plays rounds with American 14-time major winner Woods, and he says he would gladly accept less success if it means maintaining a more normal life away from the course. \n\"I've played golf with him and said: 'What are you doing tonight? Do you want to come and have dinner with us?' And he can't,\" McIlroy added. \n\"For me, that's unfathomable. I could not live like that. \n\"If someone was to say, 'you can have 14 majors and 70 wins but have to deal with that, or nine majors and 40 wins and stay somewhat the same as you are', I'd take the second option all day.\" McIlroy (right) has four majors compared with Woods' 14 Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:32:28.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
