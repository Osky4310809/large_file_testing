The day commences with the Kola Bou bath -- a banana tree is bathed before dawn in a river or body of water, dressed in a sari like a newlywed bride (known as \"Kola Bou\", the banana bride), and used to transport the goddess's energy. Nine different types of plants are worshiped, representing the nine divine forms of Goddess Durga. Ashtami (September 28, 2017) is one of the most significant days of Durga Puja. The goddess is worshiped in the form of a young unmarried virgin girl, adorned as Goddess Durga, in a ritual called the Kumari Puja. In the evening, the important Sandhi Puja is performed to worship Goddess Durga in her Chamunda form, which slayed the two accomplices of buffalo demon Mahishasura -- Chanda and Munda -- during her battle to kill the demon. The puja is carried out at the time the slaying took place. Navami (September 29, 2017) is the last day of worship, which concludes with a maha aarti (great fire ceremony) to mark the end of the rituals and prayers. Goddess Durga is believed to have killed the buffalo demon Mahishasura on this day, and she's worshiped in the form of Mahisasuramardini, the Annihilator of the Buffalo Demon. Everyone gets dressed up in their finest, most glamorous clothes. The goddess's favorite bhog (food) is prepared and offered to her, and then distributed to devotees. Dashami (September 30, 2017) is when Goddess Durga returns to her husband's abode and the idols are taken for immersion. Married women offer red vermillion powder to the Goddess and smear themselves with it (this powder denotes the status of marriage, and hence fertility and bearing of children). After the immersion, people visit their relatives and friends to give and receive blessings. Sweets are distributed and lavish dinners shared. The dress code for the day is traditional and classic.
