By Julia Malacoff | Feb 22, 2017 Topics: \nElvie \nWhile every Oscars nominee hopes they'll end up taking home a gold statue, even the 'losers' receive one heck of a consolation prize: The legendary swag bag that last year totaled over $200,000. Past goody bags have included everything from luxe vacations to jewelry and even free plastic surgery procedures. (For real!) While these types of over-the-top gifts are pretty standard at this point, there was something on the list this year that we were actually pretty shocked to see: an Elvie pelvic floor exercise tracker, which in part, promises to tighten your vagina and pelvic floor. ( We had one writer try it out—here's her uncensored take .) \nElvie, which retails for $199, is touted as \"your most personal trainer,\"—meaning you insert the device into your vagina and then an app guides you through different exercises that are meant to specifically work your pelvic floor. If you've never heard of a pelvic floor exercise tracker, you're not alone. You probably have heard of Kegels, though, which are exercises that target your pelvic floor muscles. Strengthening those muscles has tons of benefits , including preventing incontinence and better orgasms. (P.S. Here's Everything You Need to Know About Pelvic Floor Dysfunction .) \nWhile the jury's still out on whether these kinds of devices are as effective as regular-old Kegels, it's cool to see them being included as part of something that is this high-profile. (And this isn't the first time an intimate product has been included, either. Last year, the Fiera vibrator was part of the swag bag.) \nLucky for the Oscars attendees, the Elvie isn't the only wellness-related gift they'll receive. Here are a few more health and fitness items that made the final cut, according to Yahoo! Finance : 10 sessions with trainer celebrity Alexis Seletzky, valued at $900 A Haze Dual V3 vaporizer , which costs $250. (See also: The health benefits and risks of marijuana ) A box of Dandi Underarm Perspiration patches , which apparently absorbs sweat and prevents clothing from sweat marks. To wear to all those personal training sessions we assume. A CPR Anytime kit and Hands-Only CPR training provided by the American Heart Association. (OK, this is actually pretty awesome.) Sweet Cheeks Cellulite Massage Mats ($99), which purportedly help reduce the appearance of cellulite. We're not really buying the effectiveness of this gift because... science, but we're eager to hear if this becomes a new celeb beauty must-have.
