Many are sold by their families. \n“About 90 percent of this child abuse takes place in the family home,” Moran told Trust Women, an annual trafficking and women’s rights conference run by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \nAlthough there is no data to indicate the scale of the problem globally, law enforcement and other agencies in various countries are reporting that numbers are on the rise with technological advances making it hard to track down the buyers. \nSEX TRAFFICKING RIFE \nThe United Nations children’s agency UNICEF estimates 1.8 million children are trafficked into the sex trade every year – but this does not include cybersex trafficking. \nThe IJM said in a statement that the Philippines national police receive well over 2,000 referrals a month of potential online exploitation of Filipino children. \nThe organisation said this was made possible by greater than ever connectivity to the internet with people in North America or Europe paying as little as $20 for a “show”. The head of the Australian Federal Police recently told local reporters they received about 4,500 referrals of child exploitation material in 2014 but this jumped to 11,000 in 2015. \nIn the United States, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reported a 98 percent rise in reports of suspected child sex trafficking in the past five years, much of it online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T06:39:59.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
