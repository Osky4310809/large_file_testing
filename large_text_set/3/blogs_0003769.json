Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan are returning to the big screen after Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania with its sequel. That is a reason enough to check this film out when it releases. And since we just loved the previous film, we want to watch its successor too. Alia and Varun look sizzling in the trailer and a lot of the credit to that goes to the comfort they share as a friend. In fact, during a scene when Varun was many shots down for his character, Alia actually helped him out so that he can get the sequence right. Awww! (Also read: Super hit Jodi: Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan have raked in Rs 150 crore at the ticket window so far ! ) \nIn this new making video, Varun talks about how drinking alcohol is one of the trait of Badri’s character. In this particular scene, he was almost 11-12 drinks down for the shot. That’s when Alia informs that at one point she had to help Varun stand on the mark, which is generally the spot at which the camera is focusing. If that’s not friendship what is. Varun like a true professional, downed so many pegs just to impart authenticity to the character while Alia helped him in his resolve. How we wish we had a friendship like them. Listen to Varun confessing the same. \nBadrinath Ki Dulhania is a love story about Badrinath Bansal (Varun) and Vaidehi Trivedi (Alia). Like every love story, the boy meets the girl and falls for her. And even while the girl tells him that she is not interested, he pursues her and makes her fall in love with him. A love story brews, but the clash of ideologies lead to a lot of complications. What will happen in the end? Will Badri get his Dulhania? For that. be at the theatres on March 10.
