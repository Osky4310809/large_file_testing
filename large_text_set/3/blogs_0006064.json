Could   \nThe names are stitched neatly in bright colours by volunteers, each one inside a square of patchwork quilt. Tracy Jones, Victoria Rose, Hannah Windsor, Mariam Mahdaqi, Rachael Slack, ­Madina Landsberg. 598 names in total. \nWhat looks like a handmade bedspread is actually a deeply affecting memorial. Each hand-stitched square represents a woman killed by their partner or ex-partner – a permanent record of the names of all the women killed in England and Wales between 2009 and 2015. Two women a week. \nOn Wednesday, these neat squares representing unimaginable loss and violence came to the heart of Parliament because it was International Women’s Day (IWD). But the timing was more poignant even than that – as Labour MPs and Lords ­gathered at the quilt on their way to watch a Budget on which human lives depend. \nThe inexcusable truth is that Government cuts have directly led to the number of squares needing to be stitched more quickly. As a recent placard on a Sisters Uncut protest about refuge closures in Portsmouth said: “Cutting domestic violence services is violence against women.” \nSince 2010, austerity’s axe has inflicted pain on local ­councils, which in turn have been forced to make more dangerous cuts. Refuges have been one of the worst hit services, despite providing life-saving help for women escaping domestic violence. \nMore than 30 refuges have been cut since 2010. The charity Refuge, the biggest provider of services, has seen cuts of over 80%. Women’s Aid says 17% of specialist women’s refuges have closed since 2010, with more than 155 women a day turned away because of a lack of space.

That money is a massive victory for campaigners, but it was money already promised and not nearly enough to replace the millions cut from domestic violence services and refuges by seven years of austerity. \nThere is deep hypocrisy in decimating council budgets that used to fund refuges in a stable, long-term way that allowed services to plan for the future, while announcing International Women’s Day largesse through Mumsnet – just as Theresa May hosted an IWD event at Downing Street. \nIn the hard, cold, real world, ­councils are being cut back to ­statutory services only – and refuges are, incredibly, not a statutory service. No council is obliged to fund one. \nSisters Uncut hears a disturbing echo here. “When perpetrators abuse survivors, they often hold them in spaces of economic uncertainty, making them constantly unsure about income and unable to plan for the future or control their own lives, forcing them to focus on surviving not thriving,” they say. “The Government’s treatment of the domestic violence sector mirrors this.” \nIn that context, the Women’s Quilt, 598 hand-stitched squares standing firm in the wind and rain outside Parliament, spoke up powerfully for women no longer able to speak for themselves. \nRoxanne Ellis, a Labour councillor from Nottingham, had the idea of creating it after reading the Nia and Women’s Aid Femicide Census which, for the first time, reported the names and profiles of the hundreds of women murdered every year in incidents of domestic violence.

Many also shared experiences of domestic violence or coercive control. \n“Many volunteers researched the women and their stories are heartbreaking,” says Roxanne, who adds that at one time she was in an emotionally abusive relationship herself. \n“They come from every community and every corner of England and Wales. The only thing they have in common is that they were killed by someone they loved and who they thought loved them.” \nFrances Bill, 66, from Brighton, says she became involved through Facebook. She travelled to Parliament to see the finished quilt after stitching two squares, for Naila Mumtaz and Frances Cleary-Senior. \n“I picked Frances because she had the same name as me,” she says. \nTo get some personal detail into the patches she looked up the cases. \nNaila Mumtaz was 21 when she was killed by her husband and three other male family members. She was also six months pregnant. \n“I found what I read so distressing,” Frances said. “Frances and I had the same name, and were similar ages. She was 49. She was an ophthalmic nurse, stabbed through the heart. I stitched some beads that look like eyes onto her patch. Her sister got in touch to say how touched she was.” \nBehind her, inside the chamber of the House of Commons, the Chancellor was taking away from women suffering domestic violence with two hands and giving with one, with ever-deeper cuts stitched into the fabric of his Budget.
