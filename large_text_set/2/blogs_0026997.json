Amid reviewing PeeCee’s Oscar outing, most of you missed another fireball of Indian talent, Priyanka Bose. The actress who starred alongside Dev Patel in the much-talked-about movie, Lion, was seen working her red-carpet walk like an award-season pro. \nredcarpetgreendress/via Instagram \nWearing an off-shoulder printed Vivienne Westwood gown, that featured an Oscars-verified thigh-high slit, the actress took to the red carpet with the intent to slay. And slay, she did! Shoulder-grazing beach hair, spring-pink lips, and jewels by Swarovski accompanied the actress’ list-topping outing.
