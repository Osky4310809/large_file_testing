Kaepernick opted out of his 49ers contract during the offseason but NFL owners have so far declined to pick up a player who took San Francisco to an appearance at Super Bowl XLVII. \n“ There was an article today , it was reported, that NFL owners don’t want to pick him up because they don’t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump,” the president told a rally in Louisville on Monday. “I said, ‘If I remember that one I’m gonna report it to the people of Kentucky — because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag.’” What can the NFL learn from the NBA about Donald Trump?

NFL owners skew conservative – during the last presidential election cycle they gave $8,052,410.00 to Republican efforts compared to $189,610.72 for Democratic causes – and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, who Trump picked as his ambassador the UK, chose to sign the veteran Josh McCown over Kaepernick on Monday. ESPN has reported that Kaepernick will stand for the anthem in the upcoming season . \nEarlier this week, the film director Spike Lee described the failure of teams to sign Kaepernick as “MAD Fishy To Me, Stinks To The High Heavens” in an Instagram post. A post shared by Spike Lee (@officialspikelee) on Mar 19, 2017 at 2:10pm PDT \nKaepernick has been critical of Trump, who he once called “openly racist”, in the past. The quarterback said he did not vote in the presidential elections.
