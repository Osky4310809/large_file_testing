Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nBrave mum Sarah Lamont is to risk her life by twice by ­becoming an organ donor to her son for the second time. \nSarah, 36, will give her four-year-old son Joe a third of her liver later this month. \nWithout it, Joe could die at any time. Then his mum will put herself in peril again to give her son a kidney. \nExperts say the mum-of-three will be only the fifth Briton in 20 years to ­become a double donor . \nSarah told the Sunday People : “Joe has got high blood pressure in his liver and he could bleed to death from blood vessels rupturing. \n“I wasn’t prepared to wait and wait and lose him. He is so precious I couldn’t bear life without him. Sarah Lamont will give son Joe a shot at life, at the expense of her own, with her double organ donation (Photo: Roland Leon/Mirrorpix) \n“He has been so through such a lot that all I want is for him to be well and lead a normal life. \n“The liver is the priority because that will be life-saving, but then I will give him a kidney because I don’t want him having to wait any longer.” Read More Lung transplant patient who waited two years for donor says 'I was lucky, but many of my friends died' \nExperts at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where the double op will be performed three weeks from now, have only ever carried out one similar procedure and that was six years ago. \nThe most risky of the two operations will be the liver retrieval which carries a one in 250 risk of death. \nRemoving a kidney for live donation leads to death in one in 4,000 cases. \nSarah, who has two other children, Max, 12, and Eve, 10, knows she is putting herself at risk by being a double donor but believes she has no other option. Joe Lamont was born with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease \nShe said: “Joe has advanced liver disease and we are running out of time. If you go into complete liver failure there is no way you can stay alive. \n“Joe has been on kidney dialysis since birth but there is no machine that will do the job of the liver. \n“I’ve had all the ­counselling about the risks. \n“They are great surgeons and will do the best for me. But if anything goes wrong for me I know I will die knowing I saved my son.” \nJoe was born with ­autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, which ­destroyed his kidney function at birth. His diseased organs were so enormous – the size of adult kidneys – that they had to be removed soon after birth to save his life because they were pressing on other vital parts. Read More Joe Lamont was in a critical condition at birth after he was born with kidneys the same size as an adult's \nThe potentially fatal condition ­causes cysts to appear in the tubes that produce and transport urine. \nThis leads to scarring and eventually the organ fails. \nA knock-on effect of the disease is that liver function can be affected. \nWhile most of Joe’s liver functions are normal the blood vessels inside the organ are not and could cause a ­rupture with fatal consequences. \nAnd because his bile ducts are scarred he is at risk of potentially fatal infections. \nIn the summer he was seriously ill with sepsis, believed to have been caused by gut bacteria seeping into his liver. Joe Lamont still manages a smile despite his battles with his ill-health \nAs a result the youngster nearly lost a leg. Intensive care doctors carried out emergency surgery on the affected limb – on the ward – to save him from amputation. \nSarah from Ballymena, Northern Ireland, said: “Joe suffered a cardiac arrest at birth and then a brain bleed, and then a collapsed lung, but each time he’s pulled through. \n“I know I have two other children to think of but I would put my life on the line for any of my children. \n“My Joe is such a little fighter. He was so ill when born, we were told he wouldn’t get to six months. In the past children with his condition were given palliative care and allowed to die. \n“He was very poorly and the thought did occur to me that maybe I shouldn’t allow him to suffer.

He’s an amazing kid who has defied the odds several times. \n“He’s not a toddler any more but he still likes to snuggle up in bed with me at night. \n“He cuddles me and says mummy, don’t leave me. He knows about the operation and how a bit of mummy’s liver and her kidney will make him well again. \n“He’s as bright as a button and is already going to nursery but he has lost a lot of his life so far to being ill. \n“He spent the first year of his life in hospital and has to dialyse four times a week. \n“So now my priority for the New Year is to make him well as soon as possible.” Sarah Lamont said she feels donating her organs is the only option to save Joe's life (Photo: Roland Leon/Mirrorpix) \nProfessor Darius Mirza, head of liver transplant surgery at University Hospital Birmingham, said: “It really is great news that parents and relatives and even friends are willing to be donors. \n“The surgery is as safe as we can make but all surgery has risks. Ideally society should be providing the solution so that we don’t need to use live donors no matter how keen they are about wanting to help. \n“We need to maximise all ­opportunities particularly when it comes to getting the good quality livers we want to use in children. \n“The donor profile is getting older. Tragically children will die and become potential donors. That’s why we need parents to agree with each other that they will donate if they lose a child. \n“And parents need to have that ­conversation with their older children so that they can be encouraged to sign up to be organ donors. \n“It’s a difficult conversation for families but less hard to have in ­advance than in a moment of grief.” Read More After a life-saving heart transplant little Roman is looking forward to his first Christmas with his twin Joe with big brother Max and big sister Eve \nSarah added: “I’d just like to thank all the families who do donate and those who are organ donors. But at the moment getting a liver is a lottery and I can’t wait any longer. I’m Joe’s mum and I’m going to do what’s needed to make him well.” \nSurgeon Paolo Muiesan, who will remove part of Sarah’s liver, said: “If it was one of my children needing a liver I would almost certainly donate. \n“She is a very motivated lady and deserves praise for undergoing surgery twice to help her son. \n“The reality is that you have an 18 per cent greater risk of dying waiting for a dead organ donor compared with having a live liver transplant. \n“It is harder and harder to get ­organs, particularly for children. \n“We would want to give them the liver of a dead donor less than 40 to 50 years of age because they are better quality. \n“However, the profile of donors who die is getting older because fewer young people are dying from trauma such as road traffic accidents. \n“That means the pool of organs for children is smaller.” \nProfessor Nizam Mamode, who performs transplants on children at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London said: “You have to admire the boy’s mum for being ­prepared to donate twice. \n“It is a courageous thing to do given the risks involved.” Read More Organ donors saved 30% more lives in Wales after opt-out system was brought in a year ago Sarah Lamont said she would put her life on the line for any of her three children (Photo: Roland Leon/Mirrorpix) \nThe Sunday People’s sister paper the Sunday Mirror is helping Birmingham Children’s Hospital with its Star Appeal to raise £3.65million to build the country’s first rare diseases centre for children. \nIt will give young patients diagnosis, co-ordinated care, research and ­treatment under one roof instead of across different clinics. \nSince the paper became involved more than £1million has rolled in, bringing the total to £2million. \nBirmingham Children’s Hospital is the only hospital in the UK which does combined liver and kidney transplants for children. Five hours on a knife edge Liver transplants involve a five-hour operation. The organ is made up of two segments called lobes. The smaller left lobe is normally given to a child while the larger right lobe would go to an adult. Once the donor liver has been removed and checked, the recipient is prepared for surgery. Sarah’s operation will take place at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital Birmingham. Her precious slice of liver will then be transported across the city to the children’s hospital. If all goes well mum and son could be home after about two weeks. Sarah’s liver will regrow in weeks and Joe’s liver will enlarge within a similar period. Here's wishing them and you a good one \nThe year 2016 was tough year for all sorts of reasons. \nBut imagine going into 2017 knowing you’re about to put your life on the line to try to save your child. \nJoe Lamont is just four. His kidneys failed him shortly after birth. \nThe blood pressure in his liver is so high he could die at any moment. So his mum Sarah is doing what mums do and have always done – stepping up for her little one. \nIn Sarah’s case she runs the risk of paying the ultimate price. \nWhat makes her do it? \nSarah says, simply, her little boy is so precious she couldn’t bear life without him. Joe could wait for a donor to become available. \nBut Sarah knows there’s no time and must take action. \nSo think of them as we kick off the New Year. \nWe hope you have a great one. \nAnd that you’ll join us in wishing and hoping that Sarah and little Joe have a happy 2017.
