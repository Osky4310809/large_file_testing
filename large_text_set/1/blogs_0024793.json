While the Flying Antelopes are working extremely hard to make the Cathedral a never lose arena, a motivated Tornadoes will definitely be on fire. \nTornadoes are not just playing for promise but believe in the chairman who backs words with action. Hon Adamu had earlier challenged the team to beat Wikki Tourist for N200, 000, and when they did he redeemed the sum while promising another. \nChidebere Blessing Ajoku’s brace, goal in each half was enough to deny the CAF Confederation Cup campaigners points at the Confluence Stadium Lokoja. \nWhile addressing the players, Hon Aliyu noted that boosting the morale of the players was something that must be done in order to get best out of them, adding that player’s welfare remains paramount.
