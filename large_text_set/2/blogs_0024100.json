It has become almost impossible to avoid advertisements and news features on this subject. This obsession with testosterone is no surprise when you consider the aging population, increasingly obese population and an environment awash in gender-bending chemicals. Countless TV ads promise more pep in your step and improved sex life, but how effective is testosterone replacement? A recent study featured on NPR provided decidedly mixed results. The number of testosterone prescriptions has tripled over the past decade. What has been lost in the shuffle are a number of potent body hacks that naturally boost your testosterone levels. This may be particularly advisable in cases where obesity is the root cause of low testosterone levels. Personally, I do not recommend using testosterone hormone replacement unless medically warranted. Even then, if you indeed have low testosterone, I would suggest considering using trans rectal DHEA cream instead of testosterone replacement, and only for the short-term. I would even be cautious with that, and only use it with careful hormone monitoring. I know first-hand that low testosterone is not an automatic outcome of aging. My testosterone and HGH levels are easily in the optimal range for a young adult male without the aid of ANY prescriptions, hormones or hormone precursor supplements. You can incorporate potent lifestyle hacks that naturally boost your testosterone levels . High intensity interval training (HIIT) gets top billing, but there are other easy to implement strategies. You will also want to optimize your vitamin D and zinc levels. The Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is an empowering method of reducing stress, which can also improve your testosterone levels. Obesity frequently results in plummeting vitality and low testosterone. For these situations, diet can be an especially potent tool. My nutrition plan is a powerful resource full of actionable strategies that can boost your testosterone levels. The first step is to jettison all processed items from your diet and to eat exclusively nourishing whole foods. It is imperative that you remove all sugar from your diet and consume plenty of healthy fats. Preparing your own food may sound time consuming but the health benefits are immense. The convenience and price of processed food is entirely illusory. You can either pay the farmer now or pay the doctor later.
