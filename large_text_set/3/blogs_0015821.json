Louisiana and Texas had their warmest winter on record with temperatures 6.8 and 5.7, respectively, above average. \nWarm, springlike air began confusing flora such as the famous cherry blossom trees in Washington, D.C. A mild late-February had cherry blossoms on the verge of blooming around mid-March. \nThe initial predicted bloom date of March 14 would have been the earliest on record. The peak blooming date has since been pushed back multiple times. Late March or early April is usually the peak blooming period. \nCherry blossoms on the national mall. (Photo/National Park Service) \nMarch’s bitter cold killed almost all blossoms that had reached the penultimate bloom stage, according to the National Park Service . The blossoms in earlier stages of blooming, about half, survived the cold and will bloom during late March. \nCherry blossoms in D.C. weren’t the only plants that were fooled by early high temperatures. In California’s Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, wildflowers bloomed early . The early bloom was also due to the abundant rainfall that California received this winter. From October to February, the park got 5.65 inches of rain, an inch above normal. \nThough Alaska experienced its coldest December through February since 2012, the winter average was 2.1 above average. \nNot only was it a warm winter, but a wet one as well. The U.S. recorded the eighth wettest winter on record. The average precipitation total for the winter was 8.22 inches, 1.43 inches above average. \nA blizzard slammed the Northeast in mid-March, with snowfall measuring 42 inches in some areas. During that storm, Burlington, Vermont, received its second highest snowfall total in recorded history for the city. Binghamton, New York, broke a 24-hour snowfall record with 31 inches of snow. The storm caused major disruptions in the Northeast with thousands of flights canceled and dangerous road conditions. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:10:18.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
