Photo by Celest Flores-Colina/INQUIRER.net \nFor so long, Olympic silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz wanted an invitation to attend the Philippine Sportswriters Association awards night gala. \nShe got her wish last year when she received a citation for winning a bronze in the World Championship. \n“I’ve always wanted to be here — even just to get an invitation,” said Diaz. ADVERTISEMENT \n“In 2009, I only won a bronze in the SEA Games, but only the gold medalists were awarded so I didn’t get an invitation. That’s why being here is really special for me.” \nShe got another invite Monday night–but this was by no means and ordinary invitation. Diaz was feted by the country’s oldest media organization as its Athlete of the Year at Le Pavillon in Pasay City. \nLooking resplendent in a black sleeveless dress, Diaz couldn’t hide her excitement as she answered questions from the media in the red carpet. \nBy now, Diaz is already used to getting accolades for her feat in the Rio Olympics. \nBut she feels the PSA Athlete of the Year is her most special one yet. \n“It’s a dream to win Athlete of the Year,” she said. “I’ve received a lot of awards the past few months, but this award means so much to me because this is something I’ve always wanted to win. And I’m with my fellow athletes.” \nDiaz bagged a silver in weightlifting in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, ending a 20-year wait for a medal in the quadrennial Games. \n“I’m grateful for the recognition,” said Diaz. “Nothing is impossible as long as you dream, you focus and you love your country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:31:22.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
