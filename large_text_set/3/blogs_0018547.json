Terry in action in the FA Cup (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n“You’d imagine he’s looking to have one or two seasons where he’s playing regularly. So you look for opportunities that will give him that. \n“We have gone a long way down the line with Bruno, and when you’re contracting players, that really impacts on whether you’re going to pursue anybody else.” \nStoke have agreed a fee of £8.7million to make Martins Indi’s loan permanent. \nHughes said: “Our focus is trying to get Bruno signed and sealed. The fee’s agreed. There’s the will and hope from all sides to get it done and we’re very close.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:19:13.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
