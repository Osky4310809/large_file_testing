Detectives found probable cause and arrested him Thursday at his home in Harris County. \nIn a statement, the School of Rock said it requires prospective instructors to undergo a criminal background check, but records suggest Placencia did not have a criminal history. The school said it also has safety training for instructors and designed its buildings \"to facilitate visibility into lesson rooms.\" Placencia is no longer employed there. \nPublic records suggest Placencia lives with his parents at their Tomball home. He does not have a defense lawyer listed. His family declined comment. \nPolice believe there may be more victims among the children who got music lessons from Placencia. Anyone wishing to come forward with information is asked to contact Detective Adam Acosta at 936-538-3414.
