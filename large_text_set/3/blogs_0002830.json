Professor Stephen Hawking (Photo: Getty Images) \n\"I think he should step down for the sake of the party.\" \nProfessor Hawking's comments came as shadow chancellor John McDonnell tried to heal divisions within the party amid claims that a \"soft coup\" was under way. \nTheresa May, meanwhile, has been urged by former Tory leader Lord Hague to call an early general election to avoid further parliamentary stand-offs over Brexit . \nAs the Prime Minister braced herself for potential defeat in the House of Lords, with many peers demanding Parliament gets a \"meaningful\" vote on the final Brexit deal, Lord Hague said she could reduce the risk of more close votes if she won an election. \nThe peer said there was \"no doubt\" Mrs May would have a better chance of making Brexit a success with a \"decisive\" majority in the Commons, warning her that different factions in Parliament will inevitably find parts of the exit deal \"difficult to stomach\". John McDonnell (Photo: Getty) \nWith Labour's prospects under Jeremy Corbyn apparently in dire straits according to opinion polls, Lord Hague urged the PM to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act and call a snap election.

William Hague (Photo: Getty) \n\"That prospect will embolden the EU negotiators, and makes an agreement that is good for the UK harder to achieve. \n\"It could also lead to a situation where the Prime Minister faces a stand-off with Parliament over a deal that will have taken two years to negotiate and is nearly impossible to change.\" \nIt came after Mrs May warned peers they could \"incentivise\" the EU to offer Britain a bad Brexit deal if they pass a further amendment to the Article 50 Bill. \nThe Lords is expected to vote at around 5pm on Tuesday on an amendment calling for Westminster to be given a \"meaningful\" vote on the withdrawal agreement secured by the PM during negotiations under Article 50 of the EU treaties.
