They’re actually gonna be exploring Russia’s meddling in the election and in Eastern European elections as well. \nNow this also comes, Anderson, as both Sheldon Whitehouse and Lindsey Graham have asked for evidence into wiretapping. Those claims by President Trump that President Obama ordered wiretaps and surveilled him during the presidential election, and Lindsay Graham says if he does not get a response by tomorrow before that hearing, he told me that he’s gonna give, make it a very tough hearing on the Justice Department on that hearing tomorrow on Russia. So a lot of news could happen tomorrow, especially if James Comey goes public or says this investigation is ongoing. But right now the FBI has not yet responded to my request for a comment. \n“And so at this stage lawmakers have not gotten any evidence,” Cooper asked, “which is something that Lindsey Graham has asked for, they have not gotten any evidence that President Trump was wiretapped at the order of President Obama?” \n“That’s absolutely right,” Raju answered, “and there was a Senate Intelligence Committee briefing, closed door briefing, that happened earlier today in which they discussed this issue of Russia and actually members of that meeting said that no, they actually had not seen any evidence yet. Including Senator Joe Manchin, who sits on that committee, and the top Democrat on that committee, Mark Warner, told me as he went into that briefing, there’s no evidence whatsoever, even though he met with James Comey last week.” \n“Now one other Senator who’s demanding some more information is Senator John McCain, who said it’s time for the administration to explain if there’s any evidence there,” Raju added.
