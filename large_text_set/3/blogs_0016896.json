Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia ’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nResidents of several West Coast cities can pick up some very cheap airfares to Copenhagen (CPH) today, and you won’t even have to fly on the usual low-cost carrier suspects . In fact, we’re currently seeing prices as low as $379 round-trip from Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO) and even San Jose (SJC) on major carriers such as Air Canada, Lufthansa, Swiss and United. \nMost of this availability is in the fall months of September, October and November with midweek or Saturday departures, but there’s also some dates in December and even January 2018. In most cases there’s a 7-night stay requirement but you don’t need any tricks to get these airfares, so just use Google Flights to find the dates you want, then book on Orbitz , Expedia or directly with the airline itself. \nUnlike many other deals to Europe that involve travel on airlines with lots of extra fees after you buy your ticket , this sale is entirely on Star Alliance carriers , which means a free checked bag and even a free meal since you’ll be traveling internationally. And if Copenhagen isn’t your final destination of choice, it’s fairly easy to find cheap flights to jump from Denmark to the rest of Europe . \nAirlines: Air Canada, Lufthansa, Swiss and United Routes: LAX/SFO/SJC to CPH Cost: $379+ round-trip in economy Dates: September 2017-January 2018", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T01:16:21.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
