President Trump on Thursday at a White House event with trucking industry executives. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images \nThe House will not vote on the American Health Care Act on Thursday as planned, Republican leaders have decided . The Republicans’ Obamacare replacement bill, depending on whose tally you’re using , is still somewhere between four and 15 votes short of being able to pass. (It’s not expected to get any Democratic votes.) \nDonald Trump met Thursday with the hard-line Freedom Caucus but was apparently not able to persuade enough of its members to get on board—or offer them enough concessions on issues like “essential benefits” and spending—to salvage the bill in anything like its current state. \nAt the time that the vote was being scuttled—I am not making this up—Trump was playing around and pretending to drive a semitruck in the White House driveway.
