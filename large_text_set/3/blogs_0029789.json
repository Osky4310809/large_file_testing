An Alexa-enabled voice-controlled desk has so many options to build upon, and I thank Dirk Grappendorf for sharing this project over on the Makers, hackers, artists & engineers G+ community ! \nThis work extends the IKEA-Hackant project from Robin Reiter , who reverse engineered the controller board of an IKEA Bekant motorized adjustable table. He added an Arduino board and four buttons to the controller, so that you can store two table positions and easily recall them. \nYou can find Robin’s work in his GitHub repository . This Video shows his project development and the operation of the modified table. \nRobin has already explained how the Bekant controller and his Arduino circuit works. So please refer to his documentation, if you want to learn more about this. In a nutshell: the current table height is received as packets on a LIN bus and the table motor is controlled by simulating presses of the original up and down buttons of the controller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:41:15.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
