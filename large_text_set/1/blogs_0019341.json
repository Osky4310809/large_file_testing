By Tom Phillips Published 24/01/2017 \nResident Evil 7 launches today, but you won't have to wait long for even more survival horror. \nThe game's Banned Footage Vol. 1 pack launches next week on 31st January for PlayStation 4 and costs $9.99 (UK price TBA). \nAfter that it's another short wait until 14th February - Valentine's Day - when Banned Footage Vol. 2 arrives. This costs more - $14.99 (again, UK price TBA). \nSony has first dibs on these DLCs - there's no word yet on how long other platforms have to wait. \nEach bundle includes two new found footage tapes to play through plus a fresh game mode. \nVol. 1 contains \"Bedroom\" and \"Nightmare\": a locked room puzzle and a wave-based survival challenge, and then Ethan Must Die: a tough mode separate from the main game. \nVol 2. includes \"21\" and \"Daughters\", featuring another run-in with Lucas Baker and a flashback to Baker family life before the main game. The pack also adds the bizarre-sounding Jack's 55th Birthday extra mode where you must feed him food against the clock. \nBoth bundles are covered by the game's season pass, which costs Â£25.
