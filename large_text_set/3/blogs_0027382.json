Here’s how to create search engine-friendly content . Quality is always important when producing new content, but it’s the SEO that can boost your efforts of reaching a target audience. SEO-friendly content doesn’t have to be difficult or time-consuming, provided that you understand how on-page SEO can work alongside your content. Here’s how to create content that both your audience and search engines will enjoy. Create original content There’s no point in creating new content if it’s not authentic enough to stand out. Even if you come up with an idea from a different source, it’s still up to you to offer your unique perspective that will add value to the particular topic. Copyscape is a plagiarism checker that can help you test your site’s content for its originality. Duplicate content , by and large, is not appreciated by search engines and it won’t help you rank higher in SERPs. If you find it difficult to come up with new content ideas, here are 21 quick ways to find inspiration for your next topic . Optimize the title Your headline is among the first things that users will come across when carrying out a search. This makes them important, and it’s useful to brainstorm as many variations as you can until you land on the best candidate. Using your focus keyword in the headline can also be a good idea, but don’t try too hard to include it . Use power words and avoid redundancy to create a clear and appealing result. Aim for a headline of 55-60 characters, as this is what Google will display on the SERP. Also, make sure that your URL is relevant to the title, rather than a sequence of numbers that only makes it more complicated. Focus on structure It’s not just the content, but also its structure, that helps search engines decide on the results they’ll display first. Thus, a clear structure with headings and paragraphs that facilitate reading are preferred both from a user perspective and also from a search perspective. Headings also help search engines get a quick overview of your content, which is why it can be beneficial to feature your focus keyword at least once. Whether you follow the structure of H1 to H6, or simply add H2 and H3 headings at relevant points throughout the text, consistent structure in your pieces of content is appreciated. Use keywords Keywords are less often used nowadays as the first signal to indicate what your post is about, but they are still helpful to offer an overview of the topic you’re focusing on. Keyword research is still useful when trying to decide on the most interesting topics for your audience. Keywords can still be part of your content, provided that they are added in context and at the right balance. There’s no need to sacrifice the quality of your content to include more keywords, as keyword stuffing can lead to the opposite of the result you want. Moz Keyword Explorer Aim for readability The readability of your content has to do with the simplicity of its language, the lack of grammatical or syntactical errors, and the sentence structure. Online readability tests allow you to learn the “reading age” someone needs to understand your content, and they depend on: sentence length number of syllables per words frequency of passive voice Despite the different readability formulas, you can still gain valuable insights on your writing that become even more useful if you want to target a wide audience. Is your content suitable for the audience you want to target?
