But when a group of boys weren’t paying attention, Winston called them out, telling them to stand up, while telling the female students to remain seated, the Tampa Bay Times reported .\n“All my young boys, stand up. The ladies, sit down,” Winston said. “But all my boys, stand up. We strong, right? We strong! We strong, right? All my boys, tell me one time: I can do anything I put my mind to. Now a lot of boys aren’t supposed to be soft-spoken. You know what I’m saying? One day y’all are going to have a very deep voice like this. One day, you’ll have a very, very deep voice.\n“But the ladies, they’re supposed to be silent, polite, gentle. My men, my men [are] supposed to be strong. I want y’all to tell me what the third rule of life is: I can do anything I put my mind to. Scream it!”\n\nInforming the boys of their power while telling the girls to remain silent is not a good look, especially for someone with Winston’s history.\nWinston, 23, realized his mistake and later clarified what he meant.\n“I was making an effort to interact with a young male in the audience who didn’t seem to be paying attention, and I didn’t want to single him out so I asked all the boys to stand up,” Winston said. “During my talk, I used a poor word choice that may have overshadowed that positive message for some.”\nWinston has tried to salvage his reputation in the NFL after he faced sexual assault allegations at Florida State. Last year, he settled a civil lawsuit with his accuser .\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:42:53.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
