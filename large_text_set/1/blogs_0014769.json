However, it seems that this friendship may also see a crack soon, if all does not go well. \nApparently, Ajay is working for quite some time on his ambitious venture Sons of Sardaar: The Battle of Saragarhi. The movie is a big-budget war film based on the 1897 battle between 21 Sikhs and 10,000 Afghans. \nLast year, Ajay had spoken about the movie saying, \"I want this project to have the scale of an international epic. Actually, I want it to be one of the biggest films that comes from India. Hence, the prep and the research is extensive. The budget runs into hundreds of crores. For me, SOS is not just an ambitious film, it is also a sentimental one.\" \nHowever, Ajay was apparently in for a shock when Salman Khan and Karan Johar announced their project based on the same battle. A leading daily reports a source as saying, \"Ajay did not believe the news initially. He considers Salman family. However, when he was sure, he sent across an emotional message to Salman saying he had not expected Salman to hurt him like this. He said to Salman that it was unfair to make a film on the same subject that his team has been working for the last two years.\" \nThe daily reports a close friend of Salman as saying, \"Knowing Salman, he might not have known of Ajay's film. He will never do anything to hurt a friend.\" \nWell, we have got to wait and watch how this one unfolds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:20:54.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
