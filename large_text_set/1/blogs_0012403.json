Coral bleaching occurs when coral loses the algae that lives within it, due to increased water temperatures and pollution. The algae gives coral its colour, and supplies nutrients; without it, the coral loses a major supply of food, and its skeleton is exposed, exacerbating the bleaching further.\nBleached corals can recover if they are not exposed to extra stress, and some reefs are more resilient than others.\nThe die-off is another alarming sign of global warming, after temperatures in the North Pole reached melting point on Christmas, and an iceberg the size of Delaware shelved off Antarctica.\nThis report comes just months after the mass bleaching crisis in the Great Barrier Reef , which saw over 67 percent of corals in one area dead.\nBONUS: Stay among the coral reefs in this unique underwater hotel room", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/f4F8uwH4Mt08jKr5DS09RGTIlck=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F345831%2F20e45d22-5699-4fb2-abb1-5fa308e3c6c1.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/CZDgghQB.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fgSuEQfcwmaRvtI3aJ83Do5oEuM=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F345823%2F54fc8375-e9e1-4427-b900-8b49ecba20d6.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5tMC6Q5gvPP9yb9cC7fNVoY6Xhk=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F345823%2F54fc8375-e9e1-4427-b900-8b49ecba20d6.png", "https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20170110_31/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kCOYEBYxsOqFlmyIxPCW5kuAd3o=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F345831%2F20e45d22-5699-4fb2-abb1-5fa308e3c6c1.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/CZDgghQB.m3u8", "http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/01/11/national/science-health/70-coral-okinawas-sekiseishoko-area-dead-survey-shows/#.WHb9KbZ96u6"], "published": "2017-01-12T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T08:32:13.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
