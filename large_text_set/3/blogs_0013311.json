Viewers wept as they watched Michelle say and Steve say goodbye to their son (Photo: ITV) \nShe said: \"The chain I’m wearing now is the chain you saw Michelle wrap around Ruairi’s wrist, but my children bought me this for Mother’s Day last year to represent Archie. \n“It’s the exact same chain, so that was a really poignant moment for me. I’ve worn this as Michelle since my children gave it to me, so it was a coincidence really in a sense that they wanted Michelle to wrap it around the wrist of the baby.\" Kym picked up an award at the TRIC Awards this week (Photo: Getty) \nKym also revealed at the awards that she was \"absolutely delighted\" with the way the storyline was received. \n\"It was obviously something very close to mine and Simon's heart,\" she added.
