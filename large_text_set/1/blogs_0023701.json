Ekpo Nta \nThe commission’s Chairman explained that a summit like the one organized by the Abia State government has become necessary because the corruption perception index indicates that “one African country still retained its ranking as the least corrupt in Africa with a percentile ranking of 63 [while] Nigeria comes in at 26 with an estimated population of 180 million.” \nHe opined that the theme of the summit, “transparency and accountability: a panacea to good governance and sustainable development”, was in line with the 2016 UK Anti Corruption Summit, pointing out that the purpose of the summit was to sensitize critical stakeholders across the states to be part of the crusade against corruption. \nHe assured that the commission would provide Abia Government the technical assistance in its effort to sensitive the people on the crusade. \nIn his remarks, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu expressed the preparedness of the State government to support the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission ICPC in its fight against corruption in the state. \nIkpeazu also expressed happiness that Abia State was the first state in the South East to host the summit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:50:25.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
