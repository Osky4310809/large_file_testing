That didn't stop the community from widely decrying the decision. \nRoss ended her talk by saying something every Halo fan wants to hear. \"For any FPS, we will always have split screen support going forward,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:13:03.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
