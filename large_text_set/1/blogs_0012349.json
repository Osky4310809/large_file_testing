The Trump team knows this. They are using BuzzFeed’s decision to deflect from CNN’s reporting, which has been matched by the other major news organizations,” the statement said.   Liberal Website Moved To Tears By Obama Now Under Fire For Trump Allegations \n“We are fully confident in our reporting. It represents the core of what the First Amendment protects, informing the people of the inner workings of their government; in this case, briefing materials prepared for President Obama and President-elect Trump last week. We made it clear that we were not publishing any of the details of the 35-page document because we have not corroborated the report’s allegations,” the network added. \nSince then BuzzFeed has been trying to avoid a public argument with CNN over its decision to publish the whole document. Editor @BuzzFeedBen tells me they're \"not going to participate in an attempt to divide the media against each other\" following CNN criticism \n— Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) January 11, 2017   \nDuring Wednesday’s media presser, Trump blasted BuzzFeed, calling it a “failing pile of garbage.” He also refused to take questions from a CNN reporter, telling him to be “quiet” and calling his company a “terrible organization” which publishes “fake news.” \nCNN anchor Jake Tapper thought Trump was wrong for not taking the network’s question during the event — but he admitted that “irresponsible journalism hurts us all.” \nThis latest controversy has intensified the debate on the responsibilities of the free press and whether or not news companies should face penalties for peddling false information. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence also took the media to task over the incident.
