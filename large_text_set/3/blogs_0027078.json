Initially, the rebels held over two dozen families. The villagers were eventually allowed to go. ADVERTISEMENT \n“The military is still in the village to conduct clearing operations. The evacuees are all safe in our designated evacuation centers in the town proper,” Dillera said. \nIn Tampakan, South Cotabato, an intense firefight between soldiers and NPA rebels also erupted early Friday. \nThe clash started when about 50 rebels attacked a paramilitary detachment in Barangay Tablu around 8 a.m., according to Senior Inspector Harold Cornel, the Tampakan police chief. \n“The fighting is still going on,” Cornel said.
