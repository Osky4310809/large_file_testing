We are going to move on with rest of our agenda, keep that on track, while we work the health care problem.” Advertisement - story continues below Top Senate Democrat Cool To Filibustering Gorsuch’s Nomination \n“We still have a promise to keep, so the speaker wants members to continue discussing this issue until we can find a path ahead,” Doug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan, later added. \nPresident Donald Trump has indicated that, for the time being, he will move on to other issues and leave health care alone until, as he said, Obamacare “explodes.” \n“As you know, I’ve been saying for years that the best thing is to let Obamacare explode and then go make a deal with the Democrats and have one unified deal. And they will come to us; we won’t have to come to them,” he told The Washington Post. “So when it explodes, they come to us, and we make one beautiful deal for the people.” \nTrump said members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who opposed the bill, “made a mistake, but that’s OK.” \nTrump was asked whether he though a bipartisan package might be easier than brining conservative Republicans into the fold. \n“A lot of people might say that,” Trump said, laughing. “We’ll end up with a better health-care plan. A great plan. And you wouldn’t need the Freedom Caucus.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
