Listen to his interview above. \nThe Irons co-chairman has revealed the shocking lengths Payet went to in order to secure his move to Marseille - including keeping himself separate from his teammates for as many as eight weeks. \nSullivan also reveals that the Frenchman's teammates wanted him out - such was the toxic atmosphere at the London Stadium. \nPayet finally got the move he wanted this week and was unveiled as a Marseille player on Monday after completing his £25million move.

Even Slaven Bilic wanted the Frenchman gone in the end (Photo: West Ham United via Getty Images) \n\"Either it was a tactic or something in his head had changed. \n\"The team wanted him out, the manager, with the greatest reluctance, wanted him out. And as much as we didn't want him out, you can't go against the consensus of the team and the manager. All smiles again: Payet signs for Marseille (Photo: Getty Images) \n\"You either make a decision. You make him sit in the reserves for six months, cost you another two to three million pounds in wages. \n\"We thought about it, because what we got out of Marseille was not our valuation of the player. They were difficult to deal with. They were lucky we accepted their offer of £25million.\" Follow all the action from transfer deadline day here.
