Well, the company is looking to ease that burden a bit. As part of the upcoming iOS 10.3 update, you will be able to use the Find My iPhone app to locate a lost AirPod . Just like the app helps you find a misplaced laptop, iPad or iPhone, it will soon tell you were that earbud fell out of your pocket.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the app uses the AirPods' wireless tech to locate them. The earbuds don't have a GPS connection, so Apple employs the iPhone's GPS tech. The map inside the Find My iPhone app will show you the last place the AirPods were in range of an iOS device connected to your iCloud account. If you happen to lose one out of range, the software will show you a general location of where it was last connected to one one of your gadgets. However, you will have to use your phone to employ this method.\nWhat happens when you drop an AirPod at home and you just can't see it? The app will also let you play a sound through the earbuds to help you locate them. Here, you have the option beaming a noise through one or both of the audio accessories. Of course, this is dependent on the fact that the AirPods haven't run out of battery yet. iOS 10.3 was released to developers today, so it shouldn't be long before it and its earbud-locating tool are available for everyone to use. Hey, at least it might save you $69 on a replacement set.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/find-my-airpods-apple-now-helps-you-locate-your-little-lost-earphone-1485280800"], "published": "2017-01-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T21:15:57.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
