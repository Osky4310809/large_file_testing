No details provided Source: BBC FoI \nThe BBC obtained the information under the Freedom of Information Act. \nRequests were sent to 122 hospital trusts in England for information about their five longest delayed discharges over the past three years. \nA total of 91 responded, but only 62 provided information about their longest delays. \nOf those, 45 trusts confirmed they had had patients stuck in hospital for 100 days or more. \nIn total, there were 130 cases of patients waiting this long. \nThe identities of the patients have not been revealed. \nMid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which reported the longest wait, with a patient kept on a ward for over a year, said it could not comment on individual cases. \nThe Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Trust had five patients who were delayed for over 100 days - all were linked to a lack of social care. \nA spokeswoman for the trust acknowledged getting patients access to care packages, including nursing home places and help in the home for daily tasks, such as washing and dressing, was proving difficult. \n\"Many of our patients are elderly with complex conditions and may require significant care both inside and outside hospital,\" she added. \nOver the past four years, the number of older people getting help from councils has fallen by quarter, while the NHS district nursing workforce has shrunk by 29% in the past five years. \nDuring this period, the overall number of days of delays once an individual is ready for discharge has nearly doubled to 200,000 a month. \nEileen Kirton, 85, from North Yorkshire, is one of a growing number of people who has been affected by the problem. \nShe spent over a month waiting to be discharged, before being moved to a rehabilitation care unit. \nShe says it was hard to remain in hospital knowing she should be out. \n\"I was isolated in a little room. I was very down. I thought I was never going to leave.\" \nThe Department of Health blamed councils, saying there was a \"thirtyfold difference\" between the best and worst performing areas when it came to delays discharging patients. \nA spokeswoman said councils had been provided with dedicated money to fund social care. \n\"Elderly patients should never be in hospital unnecessarily,\" she added. \nBut Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said the care system was facing a funding gap of £2.6bn by 2020. \nShe said government policies, such as giving councils the ability to increase council tax to pay for care, fell \"well short\" of what was needed. \n\"Only genuinely new additional government funding for social care will give councils any chance of protecting the services caring for our elderly and disabled and ensure they can enjoy dignified, healthy and independent lives, live in their own community and stay out of hospital for longer,\" she said. \nCouncils are expected to spend £16bn this year on social care - topping this up to over £19bn once contributions from individuals are included. \nAdditional reporting by George Greenwood \nA week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T19:54:39.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
