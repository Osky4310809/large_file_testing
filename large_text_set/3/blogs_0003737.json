Trump speech criticised by Sanders for 'stirring up fear and hatred' \n“Let’s call Trump’s travel ban what it is: A racist and anti-Islamic attempt to divide us up.” \nIn a separate statement, he added: “A president who respected our traditions of religious freedom would not have resorted to hateful, anti-Islamic rhetoric to justify a ban on travel from six mostly Muslim countries.\" \nMr Trump signed a second immigration executive order earlier this week, outlining the details of the revised travel ban. This isn’t about keeping America safe. Let’s call it what it is. This ban is a racist and anti-Islamic attempt to divide us up. https://t.co/nDrGdOUNUs — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) March 6, 2017 \nThe original order was blocked in the courts after it was deemed unconstitutional. \nThe revised version affects fewer people because it will apply only to new immigration applications and not those with existing US visas, as the original version did. \nBut similar to his first order as it still specifies that 90-day ban on people from six majority-Muslim countries- Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \nOnly Iraq was dropped from the list of banned countries.

Some experts have also warned that it will strengthen extremist groups’ claims that the West is the enemy of Muslims and will fuel radicalisation.
