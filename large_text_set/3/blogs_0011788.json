They’re a different beast and Paul Green’s set to unleash an “animal” just to prove it. \nRead on below for our comprehensive round three preview with full team lists, odds, stats that matter and fearless predictions. \nMake no mistake about it, North Queensland have been rocked by the season-ending injury to Scott and the two-week suspension to Taumalolo. \nWhile the Dally M Medallist is only missing short term, the cumulative effect of the big-name losses starts to take its toll on a club. \nBut it also sheds light on a succession plan that’s been 12 months in the making - and it’s got a former director of the club’s board, Ben Ikin, excited for a “dangerous” reincarnation. Cowboys' Matt Scott faces the judiciary this week. Source: News Corp Australia \nBen Ikin, Nathan Ryan and Ben Glover are joined by Eels coach Brad Arthur to discuss the club’s future recruitment plan and how they recovered after the year from hell. \nYou can also subscribe via iTunes or for Android users, listen on the iPP Podcast Player app. \nThe Cowboys knew by midway through last year they were going to lose Tamou. \nThey’ll know pretty soon if Scott will follow him out the door to finish his career at another club. \nIn the meantime they’ve got the best part of a full season to trial the contenders. It’s rugby league’s very own reality TV show, ‘Prop Stars’. \nThere’s the starting pair of premiership veteran Scott Bolton and Maroons aspirant Patrick Kaufusi, and behind them there’s some fun to be had. \nTaumalolo’s two-week ban puts the experiment on hold but Ikin reckons he could be just as good at prop, which is where things get interesting and where the above “animal” reference comes in. \n“Shaun Fensom is a very handy player for the Cowboys to have right now,” Ikin told the Fox Sports Market Watch podcast this week. \n“If he comes in and plays lock forward, which is a middle position these days - even if he’s different to Jason Taumalolo - you could effectively play Taumalolo in the front row, as you could with Coen Hess. \n“Hess was described to me last week as an animal and not too far off being State of Origin ready. \n“There’s not a direct replacement for Scott but Fensom moving into lock forward may allow Paul Green to reshape his forward pack and give it a different look. It would potentially be just as dangerous.” Why Green should take NZ job 1:33 \nSo, a weakened pack facing the Sea Eagles, but not one that would have Trent Barrett licking his chops in anticipation. \nAnd if you thought the Cowboys’ forward replacements were better than average, the backline replacements for Lachlan Coote and Antonio Winterstein aren’t too shabby either. \nKalyn Ponga gets his first crack in the No.1 jersey at NRL level for a showdown with fellow young gun Tom Trbojevic and Javid Bowen comes onto the wing. \nIt all makes for a very watchable game on Saturday night. \nWelcome to The Big Picture - the only round three preview you need. Dogs stick solid with Des 0:38 \nMelbourne Storm v Brisbane Broncos at AAMI Park, 8.05pm (AEDT) Thursday \nStorm: 1. Billy Slater 2. Suliasi Vunivalu 3. William Chambers 4. Cheyse Blair 5.

Jai Arrow 18. Benji Marshall 19. George Fai 20. David Mead 21. Jonus Pearson \nThe talking point: All eyes will be on Melbourne’s No.1 in Billy Slater with the veteran fullback making his long-awaited return from a shoulder injury. With Slater having played just one NRL game since May 2015, there is some concern about how his body will hold up to 80 minutes of first grade football. The former Queensland and Australia representative will no doubt have plenty of traffic coming his way and Storm coach Craig Bellamy admitted he may not play the full game. The other intriguing aspect of this time is how Cameron Munster will slot into the five-eighth role. \nThe odds (courtesy of UBet): Storm $1.57, Broncos $2.45 \nThe Fox Sports Lab stat: Melbourne has won 11 of 12 games against Brisbane in Melbourne with Cooper Cronk and Cameron Smith in the team. \nOur prediction: Slater’s inclusion is a huge boost to the Storm side who will be eager to welcome back their superstar fullback with a win in front of a home crowd. Storm by 4. Mal on Semi's Roo future 1:43 \nCanterbury Bulldogs v Warriors at Forsyth Barr Stadium, 6pm (AEDT) Friday \nBulldogs: 1. Brad Abbey 2. Brett Morris 3. Josh Morris 4. Brenko Lee 5.

Charlie Gubb 17. Bunty Afoa 18. Blake Ayshford 20. James Gavet 21. Tuimoala Lolohea 22. Mason Lino \nThe talking point: With Will Hopoate and Kerrod Holland out injury, Canterbury have two new backline additions in rookies Brad Abbey and Marcelo Montoya. Both players have been setting the lower grades alight and Bulldogs fans are eager to see how they perform on the big stage. The team’s attack showed signs of improvement in round two against the Roosters but was still clunky. With Abbey being injected into the spine, he could be the man to spark the blue and whites. \nThe odds (courtesy of UBet): Warriors $1.70, Bulldogs $2.15 \nThe Fox Sports Lab stat: Canterbury are 15 from 17 when holding the Warriors to 20 points or less. The Bulldogs are 13 of 15 when scoring 24 or more. \nOur prediction: This could go either way. Warriors in a close one.

Daniel Alvaro 16. Rory O’Brien 17. Frank Pritchard 18. David Gower 19. Marata Niukore 20. Kirisome Auva’a 21. Siosaia Vave \nThe talking point : No Hayne? No worries. Fans looking for that X-factor they so desperately crave need look no further than Bevan French - the young gun who’s adopted Hayne’s old No.1 blue and gold jumper. He’s touted for bigger and better things, just as Hayne once achieved when running around with Parramatta. And if French disappoints, there’s always the flying Fijian and his centre partner pulling tricks out of their bag. \nThe odds (courtesy of UBet): Eels $1.52, Titans $2.55 \nThe Fox Sports Lab stat: Going back to 2016, Gold Coast has lost its past five matches. This is the Titans equal second worst losing streak; one more loss will equal its worst of six matches (2011, 2014). \nOur prediction : Eels will put the sword to a depleted Titans side. Bennett let Slater slip 1:01 \nNewcastle Knights v South Sydney Rabbitohs at McDonald Jones Stadium, 4.30pm (AEDT) Saturday \nKnights: 1. Brendan Elliott 2. Ken Sio 3. Dane Gagai 4.

Robbie Rochow 17. George Burgess 18. Siosifa Talakai 19. Anthony Cherrington 20. Cameron Murray 21. Thomas Burgess \nThe talking point: Can the Newcastle do it again? The Knights players and fans had to wait a bloody long time for last Saturday’s victory and they’ll be fired up to experience that winning feeling again in front of their home crowd. South Sydney can’t afford to be complacent, otherwise they’ll be driving back down the F3 rather disappointed. \nThe odds (courtesy of UBet): Rabbitohs $1.55, Knights $2.50 \nThe Fox Sports Lab stat: Newcastle are 25 from 27 against the Rabbitohs when they score 16 points or more. The Knights are a perfect 13 from 13 when scoring 26 points or more. \nOur prediction : The Knights won’t die trying, but the Rabbitohs should have too much strike power. Knights players celebrate a try. Source: Getty Images \nPenrith Panthers v Sydney Roosters at Pepper Stadium, 7pm (AEDT) Saturday \nPanthers: 1. Matt Moylan 2. Dean Whare 3. Waqa Blake 4.

Aidan Guerra 14. Isaac Liu 15. Zane Tetevano 16. Ryan Matterson 17. Connor Watson 18. Chris Smith 19. Paul Carter 20. Lindsay Collins 22. Mitchell Cornish \nThe talking point : Two of the pre-season premiership favourites get the chance to test their mettle against one another. The young Panthers found a roadblock in round one but bounced back with a dominant performance last week. The Roosters haven’t looked like slowing down. \nThe odds (courtesy of UBet): Panthers $1.91, Roosters $1.91 \nThe Fox Sports Lab stat: Both Mitchell Pearce and Shaun Kenny-Dowall will pass Roosters great Brad Fittler for games played for the club, moving into equal fifth place in their 218th match respectively. \nOur prediction : Roosters will sneak home in a tight one thanks to some Mitchell Pearce magic at the death. Farah set for game 250 2:06 \nNorth Queensland Cowboys v Manly Sea Eagles at 1300SMILES Stadium, 9pm (AEDT) Saturday \nCowboys: 1. Kalyn Ponga 2. Kyle Feldt 3. Justin O’Neill 4. Kane Linnett 5.

Jarrad Kennedy 17. Shaun Lane 18. Jonathan Wright 19. Jackson Hastings 20. Matthew Wright 21. Billy Bainbridge \nThe talking point: How are North Queensland going to cope without Matt Scott and Jason Taumalolo? The Cowboys were already stretched in terms of forward depth before they lost the duo to injury and suspension respectively. A lot will be expected of Patrick Kaufusi, Scott Bolton, Sam Hoare and Coen Hess, while Shaun Fensom is likely to make his club debut with Taumalolo out. \nThe odds (courtesy of UBet): Cowboys $1.25, Sea Eagles $4.00 \nThe Fox Sports Lab stat: The Cowboys will be without Matt Scott and Jason Taumalolo for the seventh time, winning two of the previous six matches without the dynamic duo. \nOur prediction: Even with a number of big guns out, the Cowboys’ depth should still get them over the line against a spluttering Sea Eagles side.

Jack Littlejohn 18. Junior Tatola 19. Justin Hunt 20. Kyle Lovett 21. Matt Ballin \nThe talking point: Jason Taylor’s future has again come to the fore of the rugby league rumour mill this week, just when it seemed the talk would die down. If his Tigers can beat the Raiders this week he’ll keep the chatter at bay for one more week. \nThe odds (courtesy of UBet): Raiders $1.40, Tigers $3.00 \nThe Fox Sports Lab stat : Chris Lawrence requires just one try to equal Benji Marshall for the most tries in Wests Tigers history on 76. \nOur prediction : Raiders will be far too strong despite last week’s dire performance.

Kurt Mann 19. Jai Field 20. Taane Milne 21. Luciano Leilua 22. Hame Sele \nThe talking point : The Red V attack is right back in the firing line one week after belting the Panthers in the opening round. Paul McGregor will be on borrowed time if his troops don’t click soon. It will be a tough assignment against the defensive steel of the Sharks defence. \nThe odds (courtesy of UBet): Sharks $1.33, Dragons $3.35 \nThe Fox Sports Lab stat: Cronulla will be aiming to win a third straight home derby for just the second time since St George Illawarra came into the competition in 1999 (Cronulla won three straight at Shark Park between 2006 and 2008). \nOur prediction : Sharks by a good couple of tries. The Red V will struggle to cross the tryline. \nLive stream all 26 rounds of the NRL premiership on FOX SPORTS. Get your free 2-week FOXTEL PLAY trial and start watching in minutes. SIGN UP NOW !
