What we didn't know is exactly where they would end up getting seeded...until today. \nAnd man, did it feel good when we saw a NUMBER FIVE ranking drop for the Gophers in the South Region who will play #12 Middle Tennessee State Thursday in Milwaukee Wisconsin. Middle Tennessee is no joke and will prove a tough matchup for the young Gophers squad. Let's take a complete look at the South Region. #SelectionSunday pic.twitter.com/41ODmegBGQ — March Madness TV (@MarchMadnessTV) March 12, 2017 \nMaybe even better, the Gophers fifth seed leaves Wisconsin Badger and Michigan Wolverine fans BITTER after Bucky pulled a #8 seed and Michigan snagged a #7 seed. \nWith a win, the Gophers could draw a matchup with the 23-8 Butler Bulldogs. Longer range look, the South Region boasts maybe the weakest of the #1 seeds in North Carolina. It's off to Milwaukee for the #Gophers !!! Here's the moment when they found out they'll be a 5-seed! #selectionsunday pic.twitter.com/mHPWm9oFkU — Ryan Shaver (@RShaverSports) March 12, 2017 #Gophers reaction to heading to Milwaukee on Thursday to face Middle Tennessee State pic.twitter.com/wASHffo5Pr — FOX 9 Sports (@Fox9Sports) March 12, 2017 Contact ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T05:10:25.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
