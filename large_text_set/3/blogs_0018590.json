And with its opening will come a whole lot of amazing-looking food based on the Legos that inspired the entirety of the attraction. Talk about being compelled to play with your food. The snacks you’ll see in Legoland are going to be absolutely awesome (like everything is, according to The Lego Movie.)\nLegoland Japan will open with seven differently-themed areas with five restaurants, and eight food stands. That means plenty of amazing new snacks inspired by Legos and lots of delicious, tasty treats you’ll be able to pick up throughout the theme park.\n\nThere’s a whole smattering of Lego-related goodies to see, including an Abominable Slush you can find in the Bricktopia area, hot dogs from the Marina Snack Shack in the Lego City zone, roast beef and French toast in the Knight’s Kingdom zone, chocolate ices in Lego blocks, and more.\n\nYou can check out a map of the park, and it’s seven various zones that include Bricktopia, Knight’s Kingdom, Pirate Shore, Miniland, Factory, Lego City, and Adventure. The Legoland theme park itself is opening up in its entirety as of April 1, and no, that’s not an April Fool’s joke.\n\nIt’s a little bit of a trek, especially if you don’t live in the area, but if you’re planning a trip to Nagoya and want to experience some of the coolest Lego-related attractions currently out there on offer. You might want to take the time to pay a visit to this awesome-looking park, especially keeping the food in mind. Leave it to Japan to continue getting all these totally cool-looking (and mouth-watering) snacks. Where’s our own version of Legoland with all these super amazing foods? Call me. I’m waiting.\nPhotos via Legoland Japan", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T03:46:08.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
