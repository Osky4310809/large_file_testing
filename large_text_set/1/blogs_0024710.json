A number of Android users have reported that they’re beginning to see the Google Photos-like Slideshow feature that originally debuted on iOS last June .\nWhat is the new Slideshow feature all about? Slideshow will turn your photos and videos into themed clips, similar to what the Assistant does in Google Photos. Basically, you’ll need to take five or more photos or videos in a day’s time, then the app will create a clip on its own. You can customize the slideshow by adding or removing shots, choosing a theme, etc.\nWhile you may not have the new feature quite yet, it looks like it is, in fact, rolling out to a number of users. Be sure to grab the latest Facebook update from the Play Store link attached below.\nSee also: The best Facebook apps for Android June 18, 2016 That’s not the only big change coming to Facebook, though. If you’ve ever thought that Facebook’s Trending section is sort of useless, you’re not alone. Instead of letting users know details about what’s trending, for the longest time, the social network simply lists the trending topic, and nothing else. Today, that’s changing.\nFacebook has just announced three new updates to Trending that will certainly help combat fake news and keep users more informed. Here’s the skinny on the improvements:\nTrending topics will now feature a publisher headline below each topic name An improved system to determine what is trending Everyone in the same region will see the same topics In case you need a visual portrayal of what exactly these changes mean for the Trending section, we’ve attached one below.\n\nAll three of these changes will begin rolling out today, and should make their way to everyone in the U.S. in the next few weeks. If you’d like more details on how Facebook chooses which topics are included in the Trending section, you can get more information here .\nPrevious updates Live Audio broadcasting \nDecember 21: Facebook has brought its new Live Audio feature to its Android app, for those who want to live-stream events without using video. This new feature should be super helpful for those who want to tell a story on Facebook with only their words and the audio around them.\nHD video upload \nDecember 7: Facebook has quietly added support for the uploading of HD videos in its Android app, which is certainly a welcome change. In addition to HD video upload, Facebook’s Android app has gained picture-in-picture mode for video, the ability to download clips to watch them offline, and specific resolution upload options ranging from 72p up to 360p.\nGet it from Google Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T01:41:48.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
