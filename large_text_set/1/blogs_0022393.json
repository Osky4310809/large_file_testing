Fourty-two of them were homicides, while 34 were a year ago. \n“I’m very concerned. I’m very upset about it,” Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. \nAnd so too, apparently, is the president, who tweeted Tuesday night that “if Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on... I will send in the feds!” If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible \"carnage\" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 \nThe tweet came a day after Emanuel had criticized the new president’s priorities. \n“This is unsolicited advice. You didn’t get elected to debate crowd size of your inaugural,” Emanuel had said. \nThat left people here wondering whether the mayor had provoked Mr. Trump’s threatening tweet, or whether the president was actually signaling potential executive action, even martial law. \nAlderman Pat Dowell CBS News \n“If he’s talking federal troops, we don’t want that in Chicago,” said Alderman Pat Dowell. \nWhat Chicago needs, she says, are federal funds for redevelopment, education and job training. \n“More jobs, not jails,” she said. \nAt the White House, press secretary Sean Spicer said the president was talking about more than money. \n“There’s other aid that can be extended as well, either through U.S. attorney’s office or other means that will ensure that the people of Chicago can feel safe,” Spicer said. \nThe federal government already has a large law enforcement presence in Chicago. More violent crime-fighting manpower is something the city and the police would welcome. \nSpicer also indicated the president wants to start a dialogue with the city to chart a path forward. He added “I think what the president is upset about is turning on the television and watching Americans get killed by shootings.” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
