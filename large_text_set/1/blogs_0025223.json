In a milestone for the continent, Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy and most populous nation, handed over power to an opposition candidate last year for the first time since democracy was restored in 1999. \n  But there have been notable setbacks to democracy, too. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, President Joseph Kabila is still in office even though his term expired last month. An election has been delayed several times and may not happen until 2018. Yet nations in the region have not deployed troops to remove him. In Gabon last year, violence broke out after President Ali Bongo Ondimba was re-elected amid widespread denunciations of manipulation of the vote. In the Republic of Congo, President Denis Sassou-Nguesso’s re-election came with accusations that he launched airstrikes on opposition strongholds. Last year, Uganda’s president, in power for more than 30 years, was re-elected in a vote marred by irregularities . In Gambia, the outcome of December’s presidential vote, while a surprise, was considered legitimate by the global community. Even Mr. Jammeh initially agreed , phoning his opponent to graciously concede. But it was a regional banding together against Mr. Jammeh that made all the difference once he made it clear a few days later that he had changed his mind and was refusing to go. African leaders took such a strong line in Gambia’s case for one chief reason: Mr. Jammeh was an easy target to align against. With a long record of human rights abuses and bizarre, repressive behavior, he had increasingly distanced himself from regional and Western governments. He had jailed journalists and opponents, some of whom were tortured or died in prison, and had been widely disliked for years. Numerous governments had denounced Mr. Jammeh’s administration long before he declared that he would defend his presidency with his security forces. “He rubbed too many people the wrong way,” said Mohammed Ibn Chambas, the top representative to West Africa from the United Nations. “He didn’t have too many friends.” It didn’t take long for regional organizations to side with the winner of the election, Adama Barrow. The United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States denounced Mr. Jammeh’s actions and called on the government of Gambia “to abide by its constitutional responsibilities and international obligations,” according to a joint statement from the groups. “It is fundamental that the verdict of the ballots should be respected.” The African Union announced that it would no longer recognize Mr. Jammeh as president as of Inauguration Day. And most important, the Economic Community of West African States — a group that despite its name has been increasingly active in peace and security matters — kept open a channel for a diplomatic solution, but simultaneously announced that it was preparing a regional military force to intervene if Mr. Jammeh did not step down.
