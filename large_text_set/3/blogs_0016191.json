I have an appointment.” \nThe Times reported that Tran, who had a history of mental illness, “breached the outer perimeter of the White House by the Treasury Department building while carrying a backpack holding two cans of pepper spray, a book by Mr. Trump, a letter to the president and other items, the authorities said.”   \nTrump was inside the White House at the time. He later tweeted, “Secret Service did a fantastic job last night.” \nHowever, former Secret Service agent and conservative pundit Dan Bongino told Fox News he felt otherwise. \n“The intruder set off multiple alarms, alarms that clearly showed someone breached the property, and he was seen by officers who didn’t think anything of it. This is a big story,” Bongino said. “That just shows the president is not safe there — in the White House. The Secret Service does not have the assets, they don’t have personnel on the ground they need to keep him safe.” \n“The Secret Service cannot even keep one person off the grounds — what will they do if 40 terrorists charge the White House?” Bongino said. “And believe me, the terrorists are already thinking about that.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:22:17.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
