Beyond its immortal \"I'm mad as hell\" moment , the film's fiery satire of the media industry was a clear inspiration to Sorkin, who previously told the New York Times that \"no predictor of the future — not even Orwell — has ever been as right as Chayefsky was when he wrote Network .\" \nTo honor Chayefsky, Sorkin delivered his own Network -style monologue, this time directed at President Trump. \"We’ve been told that as coastal elites we’re something less than real Americans and that we’re out of touch,\" he said, before taking on many of Trump's favorite talking points, claiming the president is more disconnected with reality than the residents of New York or Los Angeles. On the \"coastal elites\" slur : \"If you find it mind-boggling that living and working in the two largest cities in America makes you less than a real American, you are not the one who’s out of touch.\" \nOn illegal voting: \"If you don’t find it remotely credible that three to five million people voted illegally in our last election, you’re not the one who’s out of touch.\" On global warming : \"If you (don’t) think climate change is a global hoax being perpetrated by unscrupulous Chinese scientists in cahoots with every other scientist in a cunning long-con to get grant money, you’re not the one who’s out of touch.\" \nOn fake news : \"If you (don’t) think the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , the Washington Post , NBC News , CBS News , ABC News and CNN lie with impunity and that the only trustworthy news source is Fox & Friends , you’re not the one who’s out of touch.\" \nOn the immigration ban : \"And if you don’t think that turning away people who are seeking a safe haven from unspeakable brutality is a morally defensible idea, then you’re not the one who’s less than a real American.\" 'Moonlight,''Arrival' take top WGA honors \nSorkin ended with a rallying cry for America's writers to keep telling their stories, both \"liberal and conservative.\" \n\"So what can we do? A lot actually. Because the most powerful delivery system ever invented for an idea is a story,\" he said, calling the WGA crowd \"America’s storytellers.\" \n\"We come from everywhere. We are old and young, black and white, gay and straight, wealthy and struggling, and yes, liberal and conservative,\" he continued. \"The most powerful delivery system ever invented for an idea is a story, and we’re America’s storytellers, and my dream of being one of you has come true.\" \nAaron Sorkin accepts the Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Television Writing Achievement onstage during the 2017 Writers Guild Awards.
