As shade ranges on shelves are expanding, so are the types of women— and men —selling us on the products. Looking past traditional celebrities, 2017 has already been a banner year for new, fresh faces for makeup brands, and the latest brand appointment couldn't have us more excited. L'Oréal Paris just announced model Maria Borges is signing on to its roster. \nBorges made history in 2015 as the first model to wear her short, natural curls at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. Since then, she's walked the runway for fashion heavyweights like Ralph Lauren and Badgley Mischka. So, suffice to say, we're not surprised L'Oréal Paris tapped her. She's redefining the standards of beauty, and a champion for self-expression. \"I feel like I did my part,\" she told Glamour.com backstage at last year's VS Fashion Show . \"I showed women they don't have to look one way to feel beautiful. Be you and showcase your beauty.\" Also unsurprising is that L'Oréal Paris is behind this, either, as the brand recently chose transgender model Hari Nef to star in a campaign—which celebrated the beauty of diversity, to boot. \nBy strutting down the runway with her natural hair, Borges broke ground for her fellow models. \"Maria was the first to do short hair last season, and for me to fall in those footsteps—for what she brought through—made me so happy,\" Jourdana Phillips , a model with cropped blond hair, told Glamour.com. \"It’s good for us to show beauty isn’t really about the length of your hair, it’s about how you project yourself and the woman you are.\" \nHer momentous walk down the runway has already changed the standard for what sexy hair means, which is why we're excited to see what she does within the world of makeup. \nRelated Stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:46:14.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
