Doyle is coming off a breakout year with the Colts. After making just 35 catches over his first three NFL seasons, the Western Kentucky product hauled in 59 passes for 584 yards and five touchdowns to easily set new career highs in every key category. The 26-year-old Indianapolis native isn't the most dynamic tight end, but he has developed into a reliable option. He possesses a terrific catch radius, rarely drops passes and has worked to become a steady blocker in the run game as well. Nat Newell of the Indianapolis Star showcased how Doyle stacked up against his fellow tight ends last season, highlighted by his top catch percentage: Nat Newell @NatJNewell Chart isn't perfect but a look at how Jack Doyle compares to other tight ends. # in () is his rank in that category. https://t.co/SX2FTUatOM https://t.co/MtI0FhPrho 1/10/2017, 6:11:48 PM Meanwhile, John Breitenbach of Pro Football Focus rated him as the second-best tight end available this offseason behind only Martellus Bennett. He highlighted the pass-catcher's \"elusiveness in the open field\" as one reason for calling him the \"highest-upside option\" at the position. After the season, Doyle stated he hoped to remain with the Colts, but he also admitted the financial side of the sport would be a factor in his future, per Zak Keefer of the Indianapolis Star . \"Really hard to see myself playing anywhere else,\" he said. \"Obviously, I want to be back. I love Indy, all that stuff. But we'll see what shakes out. There is a business part of it.\" In the end, Doyle got his wish, as he was able to find enough common ground with the Colts to stay. That's great news for Andrew Luck , who enjoyed a bounce-back year in 2016 due in part to his success working over the middle to options like Doyle. He should continue to form a rock-solid one-two punch at the position with Dwayne Allen. With Indianapolis featuring a number of deep threats on the outside, led by T.Y. Hilton and Donte Moncrief, Doyle should see a high volume of targets thanks to his dependable hands , especially on third down.
