This week, while many are focusing on the products being announced at CES in Las Vegas, Evan Blass revealed some alleged details about the HTC One X10.\nIf his sources are true, this phone will have a 5.5″ 1080p display and be the successor of the company’s One X9 phablet.\nWe generally see successors to an older phone come out with better, or at least more powerful, hardware than the device that came before it. However, Evan’s sources are telling him that the HTC One X10 will be shipping with the MediaTek MT6755V/C SoC. This chip has an eight core CPU clocked at 1.9GHz (while the X9 had eight cores clocked at 2.2GHz), and it is being paired with the Mali T860 GPU.\nThe CPU seems to be the only area that is slacking when compared to the One X10’s predecessor. The rumor says the upcoming phone will have 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, which are at least on par with what HTC released last year in the One X9. Instead of improving the processing package, HTC has chosen to focus on the camera with this phone. The HTC One X10 is said to come with a 16.3MP rear-facing camera and a 7.9MP front-facing camera.\nEvan says HTC is currently working to get the One X10 released sometime this month.\nSource: VentureBeat \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T17:01:19.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
