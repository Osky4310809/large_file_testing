But that will be solely up to South Sydney coach Michael Maguire. \nWhat the 20-year-old Bunnies recruit does know is that if this rugby league caper doesn’t work out, he has plenty of other career paths laying in front of him. \nIn fact Fuimaono has more fingers in more pies than most people his age. More than most professional sportsmen of any age, for that matter. \nDon’t be mistaken — he’s always wanted to play rugby league for a living. But that hasn’t stopped him preparing for a life outside football if and when that time comes. \nFuimaono is midway through a degree in business commerce at Western Sydney University. He’s interested in property development. \nAside from that, he’s planning to apply for a real estate licence in the not too distant future, and he’s studying for a Certificate 4 in fitness. \n“A broad range, just keeping my mind open to anything,” the switched-on Fuimaono tells foxsports.com.au . \n“I’m fortunate to be a rugby league player. We do have a lot of opportunities and help off the field, so one thing I’ve always said is to take it with both hands if someone is encouraging or providing you (an opportunity).” Tyrell Fuimaono playing for NSW under 20s. Source: Supplied \nFuimaono credits the NRL’s School to Work program — particularly the work done with indigenous children — for his eagerness and passion to follow opportunities outside football. \nIt was with the help of NRL education officers that he gained early entry into university and began his tertiary studies. \nHe has a simple message for any young indigenous person wanting to follow a similar path. \n“Never say no,” he said. \n“Just jump at it, take every opportunity that you’re given because we’re very fortunate to get that. Not everyone is provided with that so never say no.” \nCheck out the social side of the game in this week’s edition of NRL Confidential! \nPRE-SEASON PRANKS \nSouth Sydney playmaker Adam Reynolds gave teammate Jason Clark a fright when he asked him to check under his car.
