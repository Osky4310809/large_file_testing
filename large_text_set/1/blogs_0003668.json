Domestic violence in the area has soared over the past decade. Photograph: The Independent/Rex/Shutterstock   17.11   17.22   \nThe police and crime commissioner for Northumbria, Vera Baird, is in talks with local government officials in an attempt to stop the withdrawal of funding for women’s refuges in Sunderland . \nThe Labour-led council recently told residents in a consultation that it would cut its budget by £74m over the next three years. \nCharity officials at Wearside Women in Need , which runs four refuges for 173 women and 107 children as well as a 24-hour helpline, said they were told their funding of £568,000 would be withdrawn in June. \nDomestic violence has been increasing in Northumbria, with incidents rising by 62% between 2007-8 and 2014-15. If the proposed cut goes ahead the charity said it would probably be forced to close. Cuts to women's refuges are a matter of life and death Read more \nBaird will meet the leader of the council and the chief executive to try to resolve the situation. \n“Sunderland would be the only Labour council in the north-east to close domestic abuse refuge provision if this went ahead,” she said. \n“My experience of councillor colleagues in Sunderland – and indeed of council employees there – is that they have always been committed and supportive of the need to tackle domestic abuse. They have often been at the forefront of innovating activities around this work that we have pursued together.” \nNorthumbria was the first area in the country to introduce a joint response to domestic violence involving a police officer and a refuge worker from Wearside Women in Need going out on patrol in Sunderland . Housing benefit cap may force 67% of women's refuges to close – report Read more \nWearside Women in Need has been running a refuge in Sunderland for 35 years. Clare Phillipson, director of the charity, said its funding had been cut by 33% since 2010. \n“If this goes ahead it will create a dangerous precedent of a council being able to stop funding all its women’s refuges. If one does so, I am sure others will think they can follow,” she said. \nA spokesman for Sunderland city council said no decision had been made. \nThe council will vote on changes to its revenue budget in February and March. \nCllr Graeme Miller, who runs health, housing and audit services, said: “Because of the unprecedented cuts and budget pressures the council has been facing since 2010, many services have to be reviewed, refreshed and reorganised. \n“While no final decisions have been made on the council’s budget for next year, the council consults with many individuals and organisations. \n“For several years, this has included dialogue on a more collaborative and comprehensive approach working with Wearside Women In Need and others to support victims of domestic violence. This dialogue is continuing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T19:32:02.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
