Marinos. \nCity itself also has close links to Spanish second tier side Girona, through their ties with Media Base Sports - the agency run by Pep Guardiola’s brother, Pere, and his business partner Jaume Roures. \nCity's owners have increasingly been looking into South America as the next arm of CFG's global expansion.

Torque would become the smallest member of the CFG stable by a considerable distance. \nCity CEO Ferran Soriano has been the man steering CFG's expansion across the globe and has always wanted one club on each continent for a number of reasons, including the expansion of the City brand, as they look to become a bona-fide European power. Pep Guardiola is tasked with City's on-field development (Photo: Getty Images) \nAnother is player-related, and CFG's purchase of Torque will ease the acquisition of South American players; City saw the signing of Gabriel Jesus delayed for a number of weeks due to a third-party claim from a former agent and are CFG are determined that similar doesn't happen in future. \nIt will help City in that respect while also being particularly geared towards helping NYCFC - the MLS club coached by Patrick Vieira, also. \nThey are looking to follow the increasing MLS-trend of bringing in young, on-the-rise players to the US, as opposed to European veterans seeking a final pay day. The purchase of Torque will help with the practice.

Teams have been fined for acting as \"bridges\" for bigger clubs in Brazil and Argentina to buy and sell players at a lower tax rate. Others, like Maldonado, have been used by investors as vehicles for third-party investment, banned by FIFA in 2015. \nThat was the case with Rulli, whose third-party ownership was ended when City purchased him last summer. Rulli was immediately moved on to Real Sociedad, where he had already been on loan.
