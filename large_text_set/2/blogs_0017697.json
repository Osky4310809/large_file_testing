Source: AP \nRooney has 18 months left on his Manchester United contract, although the club have the option of extending it by another year. \nUnder Mourinho, Rooney has become a squad player at United and has not played since February 1 because of a muscle injury. \nCSL clubs are allowed to have only three foreign players in their starting line-ups. \nThree clubs still have a slot available for a foreign player - Tianjin Quanjian, Jiangsu Suning and Beijing Guoan - but other clubs could also sign Rooney and drop another one of their foreign players. \nRooney was a member of the United squad which travelled to China last July on a pre-season tour which was plagued with problems. \nUnited were unable to train properly because of the intense heat and pollution in Shanghai and Beijing and their game against Manchester City was cancelled because of the poor state of the pitch at Beijing’s Birds Nest Stadium.

Source: AP \nAguero briefly lost his place to Jesus, raising questions over how he fitted into Guardiola’s plans and whether he had a long-term future at the club. \nBut Aguero, who is under contract until 2020, played down speculation that his recent spell on the bench could lead to him leaving the Etihad Stadium. \n“I’ve always said I want to be here at the club, I’ve always said that at the end of the season it won’t be my decision,” said Aguero. \n“The truth is that with these things it’s the club that handles everything, and obviously it’s always my intention to stay.” \nWhen asked about his relationship with Guardiola, Aguero added: “The truth is we get on very well. City edge Monaco in classic 1:17 \n“What he wants, above everything, from all the players is that we push a little more. He’s always asking me for more, more, more. \n“Obviously it’s a sacrifice I have to make, that we all have to make, and fortunately tonight it worked and we’ll see if it keeps working in the next game.” \nAguero spent the previous three games on the substitute’s bench but his two goals on Tuesday took his goal tally for the season to 20. \n“The truth is that those things are for the manager to decide,” he added. “The only thing I can do is keep fighting to be able to play. \n“Fortunately he counted on me, now I have to help the team and show what I can do.” \nManchester City will now be favourites to advance to the Champions League quarter-finals but after such an open first leg against Monaco, their last-16 tie is not yet over. \nAguero said: “It’s not over but it’s important that we’re two goals up. If it was one obviously it would be more complicated.” \nMARTIAL GOING NOWHERE \nManchester United winger Anthony Martial insists he wants to remain at Old Trafford “for as long as possible”. \nMartial has struggled to recreate the scintillating form he produced during his first season in English football and has now found himself fighting for first-team opportunities under Jose Mourinho. \nHowever, the 21-year-old - who became the most expensive teenager in history when he joined United from Monaco in 2015 - has started to show signs of improvement in recent weeks after starting three consecutive games.
