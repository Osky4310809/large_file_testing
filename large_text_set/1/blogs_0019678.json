Archie Bello, a farmer from the village of New Antique in Mâlang, North Cotabato has very little crop left to harvest from a small 2-hectare rice field a month after PAG-AGA declared a weak El Nino in the Philippines. With no signs of rain coming soon, Bello and his family face an uncertain future. File photo by Karlos Manlupig/Greenpeace   An estimated 3.1 million Filipino families experienced involuntary hunger at least once during the 4th quarter of 2016, a recent Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey reported. Published first on BusinessWorld on Tuesday, January 24, survey results showed that 13.9% of respondents suffered from involuntary hunger from November to December 2016. This is 3 points higher than 10.6% or an estimated 2.4 million families during the 3rd quarter survey conducted in September. It is also 2.2 points more than December 2015’s 11.7% or estimated 2.6 million families. Moderate hunger – not having something to eat “only once” or “a few times” – in the last 3 months affected 10.9% or an estimated 2.5 million families. It is almost 2 points higher than September’s 9.1% or 2.1 million families. Meanwhile, 3% or an estimated 673,000 families experienced severe hunger – going hungry “often” or “always” – an increase from the previous results of 1.5% or 329,000 families. Hunger rates increased in all areas Hunger rate – the sum of moderate hunger and severe hunger rates – increased in the last 3 months of 2016 in all areas in the Philippines. In Metro Manila, the hunger situation rose by 5.7 points from September’s 7.3% or 225,000 families to 13% or 399,000 families in the last quarter of 2016. The hunger rate also increased by 3.3 points in Balance Luzon to 15% or 1.5 million families from 11.7% or 1.2 million families in the previous survey. The number of families in Visayas also climbed by 3.7 points. From 13% or 565,000 families in September, the hunger rate is now 16.7% or 724,000 families. Meanwhile, in Mindanao, the latest hunger rate rose by 1.7 points to 10% or 515,000 families from 8.3% or 429,000 families. The survey was conducted from December 3 to 6, 2016 via face-to-face interviews among 1,500 adults nationwide with sampling error margins of ±3 points for national and ±6 points for Metro Manila, Visayas, and Mindanao, and ±4 points in Balance Luzon. – Rappler.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T09:02:31.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
