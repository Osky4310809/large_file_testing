But we've got a good feeling about Bella Hadid's distressed skirt. Something tells us the throwback mini, shredded at the hem, and complete with just one button instead of a whole row, is back. While we used to throw on such a design with glittering graphic tees from Abercrombie, or yes, even Limited Too, Bella shows us the perfect way to refresh our old '90s look . \nSlip into a cami and accent with matching accessories — the supermodel chose patent leather moto boots and a Givenchy bag — then hit the road.
