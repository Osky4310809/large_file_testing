But on any given day they can beat any of the sides and they have done that, apart from England.\" George North scores a try on 'super Saturday' last year Bonus points \nThe Six Nations have also employed bonus points for the first time although a side who wins the Grand Slam are guaranteed to win the tournament. \n\"It is something we have considered for many years but resisted to date,\" said Feehan. \n\"If you look at the Six Nations, it is inherently unfair because some teams have three home games and other teams have two home matches in any given year and there is an imbalance. \n\"That word balance is key and we are looking to see whether the benefits we get on encouraging more tries to be scored is better than any direct imbalance. \n\"We decided we had to give it a try to see if it works. \n\"If you look at the the championship two years ago, we ended up with 27 tries on the last day. \n\"Teams can score tries when they wish to and need to. \n\"That's what we are trying to encourage.\" \nListen back to the full John Feehan interview on BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad show on Monday, 30 January.
