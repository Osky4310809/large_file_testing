Language Tweet \nA proposed draft by the Trump administration states that US is planning to change visa process for countries who have enjoyed visa interview waiver program till now. \nThe Huffington Post is reporting that a draft copy of an executive order on immigration and refugees which is likely to be signed this week states Australians planning on visiting the US could be forced to undertake an in-person interview with American officials under strict new border rules. \nThe draft states - Suspend the visa interview waiver program indefinitely and review whether existing reciprocity agreements are reciprocal in practice . \nThe visa interview waiver program that allows Australians and citizens from 37 other countries a 90-day tourist visa to easily enter the US by simply submitting biographical information online, could be suspended. \nVisitors, instead, would have to sit for an in-person interview before entering the US. \n\"The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act), which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa, undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions,\" the draft executive order states. \nREAD THE DRAFT HERE: YOU MAY ALSO LIKE TO READ: US President Donald Trump to order visa ban for citizens of 7 countries In his tweet late on Tuesday, Trump said: \"Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow.
