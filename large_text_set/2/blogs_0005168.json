Every trailer, every gameplay demo, every Jimmy Fallon appearance — they all found Link just runnin' around in a big empty field. Field, field, field. Were we Zelda fans waiting years and years for Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Field ? \nPress A to till. (source) \nBut this new trailer, released today on the game's Japanese website and thrown up on YouTube by Gematsu , shows that Breath of the Wild will NOT be a farming sim. It will instead feature many different locales, including a rain world, a fire village, a snow zone, and a ball pit. Okay, there's no ball pit, but like, there should be. Link works too hard not to have any fun :) (source) \nGuys, we're less than a month away from this game. Can you believe it? In just over three weeks, we're going to be playing a new open-world Zelda game on a new Nintendo portable console . That means I'm going to be looking for Heart Containers in the backseat of an Uber . And let me tell you, that's the reason I was so worried it looked like Breath of the Wild was just going to be in a field — my commute is boring . \nI'd prefer Gannon just set the whole thing to flame.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:07:23.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
