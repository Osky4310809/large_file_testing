bill Lords' Brexit debate: Peers to table amendments on Article 50 bill PEERS will debate Brexit this afternoon and are expected to table a number of amendments. PUBLISHED: 00:00, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 | UPDATED: 00:54, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 \nLeader of the opposition in the House of Lords, Baroness Smith, said there would be no \"extended ping pong\" with the Commons over the Article 50 bill. \nHowever, peers have demanded some changes to the legislation which went through the Commons before recess. \nFormer Labour cabinet minister Lord Hain has also claimed he has a mandate to try to amend the Brexit bill. PA•GETTY The peers will be debating Article 50 in the House of Lords \nHe is to argue: \"Critics say 'what right have I, an unelected peer, to oppose this Bill or even to seek radically to amend it?' \n\"But I was appointed by my party. And in the referendum, two thirds of Labour electors voted to Remain. That's what I am reflecting, that's my mandate.\" \nLords are expected to debate the bill for the next two days. \nPrime Minister Theresa May has promised to trigger the Article 50 by the end of March. \nBelow is Express.co.uk's blow-by-blow coverage of how the Lords debate played out today... Related articles Brexit bill House of Lords: How to watch the Article 50 debate? \nThe debate will continue tomorrow. \n11:00pm update: The Labour peer Baroness Royall of Blaisdon ended proceedings with a warning as she said: \"With this Bill the country is embarking on a perilous journey towards an unknown future, which rather than being driven by economic well-being is being driven by immigration control.\" \n10:55pm update: Former lord chief justice and independent crossbencher Lord Judge supports a quick decision. He said: \"For the purposes of this Bill, the starting of the process under Article 50, surely Parliament must accept the result without equivocation or delay. \n\"Surely Parliament cannot now seek to attach conditions to the exercise of the Article 50 power. That is not what the referendum was about. \nHe added: \"It would be an astonishing coup for those negotiating on behalf of the EU with us, if we here in Parliament sought to set out conditions in advance of the negotiations that we would or would not find acceptable. \n\"Frankly if I were on the other side I would welcome such conditions being imposed. I would greet it with hilarity and think the British had once again played into our hands.\" \n10:42pm update: Conservative peer Lord Callanan said he \"unwelcomed\" amendments to the bill and launched a scathing attack on the hypocrisy of peers who \"enthusiastically supported the referendum bill, but now tell us they do not accept the result of the referendum\". \n10:21pm update: Tory peer Lord Balfe led a gloomy tone, saying: \"Overall we lost, I lost, and I believe the country lost. Over time I hope they begin to realise the foolishness of that decision.\" \n10:15pm update: F ormer justice of the Supreme Court and independent crossbencher Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood said he supported the Bill with the \"deepest misgivings\". \nHe said: \"Whatever damage we judge Brexit may do to the national interest, it is still less than the damage which I believe would inevitably be done to the public's trust in the political process if we were now to thwart the majority vote.\" \nLord Browne said he was disinclined to support any amendments aimed at binding the Government at a future point, but urged ministers to give immediate assurances to EU nationals already in the UK. \n10:02pm update: Tory former minister Lord Blencathra warned a \"firestorm\" would be unleashed if peers tried to thwart the referendum result. \n\"You have no idea of the destruction we would create if we go against the decision of the electorate now,\" he said. \nIf peers tried to amend the legislation it would be perceived as the \"deliberate sabotage of the will of the people\". \nHe said their opinions on the EU were \"utterly irrelevant\". \nLord Blencathra said peers would be called \"the real enemy of the people. We will have unleashed demons which will not be controlled. This House will be destroyed.\" \n9:49pm update: Liberal Democrat peer Lord Bruce of Bennachie attacked the Government over claims that some of the UK's foreign aid budget could be moved to boost the chances of a favourable Brexit deal. \nHe said: \"At the weekend we were told we should use our aid budget to sweeten a trade deal by spending it in Europe and not Africa. How hard-faced to take money away from the poorest in Africa and south Asia to try and win votes from eastern European member states. How despicable.\" PARLIAMENT TV Lord Balfe says he hopes people will realise their 'foolishness' \n9:42pm update: Labour's Lord Foulkes of Cumnock said he would continue to oppose the UK's divorce from the EU as he warned ministers: \"You ain't seen nothing yet.\" \nHe said: \"I remain totally opposed to Brexit. I'm not going to throw in the towel. It's going to be a total disaster if we go ahead: economically, socially and in every other way, and it was sold on a false prospectus. I will oppose it by any legal and constitutional means.\" \n9:28pm update: Lord Carlile of Berriew spoke against a second referendum saying: \"that sounds like enjoying punishment and wanting more\". \nHe claimed amending the bill would bring Parliament into \"greater disrepute than it already is\". \nLord Carlille, who was a Liberal Democrat but now sits as a non-affiliated peer, added: \"If we judge as a Parliament, in both Houses, that the arrangements which have been agreed are to the detriment of the national interest compared with the alternatives or if they endanger security in Europe, at that point we will be properly informed as to what has been discussed. \n\"We will be properly informed as to what has provisionally been agreed and we will then be exercising our constitutional role, if it be the case that what is agreed is unsatisfactory, to reject it. That seems to me to be the correct constitutional analysis.\" \n9:15pm update: Tory peer Lord Sterling of Plaistow revealed he was \"almost ostracised\"when he told friends he was voting for Brexit. \nHowever he admitted people have come round to thinking \"let's get on with it\". PARLIAMENT TV Lord Cumnock said he would continue to oppose the Brexit bill \n9:07pm update: Lord Hannay of Chiswick warned Britain \"will be less prosporous, secure and less influential in the world than we would have been if we decided to stay in the EU.\" \nThe former diplomat said the bill was \"short but certainly isn't sweet\". \n8:47pm update: Tory Baroness Wheatcroft said the EU referendum had unleashed a \"wave of anger and intolerance, which is truly frightening and dangerous for this country\". \nShe said that after voicing concerns about the outcome she had been branded a \"s***, w****, harlot, scum and much, much worse\". \nLady Wheatcroft said: \"I don't believe we are appointed to this House merely to troop obediently through the lobbies.\" \nThe terms of Britain's departure from the EU must be put to Parliament in a \"meaningful vote\" and there must be a referendum to determine if it was the will of the people to leave on those terms, she said. \n8:34pm update: Baroness Armstrong of Hill Top says she fears that rising populism, which rejects diversity, is becoming the \"driver of politics\". \nThe Labour peer said: \"We're living in a world where complexity is scaring people.\" \nShe says people \"believe what they read about migrants and they're frightened\". PARLIAMENT TV Baroness Wheatcroft said the Leave vote had released a 'wave of anger and intolerance' \n8:15pm update: Staunch Remainer Baroness Featherstone began her speech by saying those who threaten the House of lords for making amendments to the Brexit bill should be \"ashamed of themselves\" \nShe said: \"The EU was our rock, it was our nearest and dearest.\" \nThe Lib Dem peer said she was \"broken hearted\" the nation was \"was walking away from peace, security and success\" when making the decision to leave the crumbling bloc. \nAnd went on to warn: \"Do not tell me not to what I believe it.\" \nOver the single market, she said Britain needed their \"heads examining\" if they made the decision to leave the single market. \nShe said she hoped \"common sense prevailed\". \n8:08pm update: Labour's Lord Anderson of Swansea argued many older voters backed the Leave campaign because of nostalgia. \nHe added: \"Perhaps the nostalgia even includes memories of the Commonwealth as it was. Indeed, a group of Conservative members apparently want a new entry channel at our ports and airports for the Commonwealth but oddly seem to focus only on the white old dominions.\" \n8.01pm update: Lord Howell of Guilford said: \"I cannot see the point in trying to amend what I think is a procedure.\" \nThe Tory peer said fears over Brexit were \"completely and utter obsolete\". \nHe added: \"The obvious conclusion, the obvious analysis, is that being in or out of the old single market is of decreasing relevance to our interests and prosperity.\" \n7:43pm update: Starting with a rather controversial confession, Labour Lord Alli says: \"I like Theresa May - there I've said it.\" \nHowever in the \"same vein of honesty\" he lays into Boris Johnson, Liam Fox and David Davis saying he does not believe they have the skills to successfully pull us out of Brussels. \nHe said \"I equally do not trust Boris Johnson, David Davis or Liam Fox to successfully negotiate a good deal with the EU or any other nation. \n\"I have no confidence that they have the skills, understanding and competence to do such a deal.\" \nFor those that had managed major commercial operations, he said: \"We know that putting the trainees to run your most important deal is a mistake, and that is what looks like will happen.\" PARLIAMENT TV Lord Alli says he likes Theresa May \n7:32pm update: Cross bench peer Lord Macpherson of Earl's Court warned against the UK using \"ameteurs who have flitted from post to post\" to carry out exit negotiations and said Britain has \"limited\" expertise in trade negotiations with the EU. \nThe former treasury permanent secretary said the sooner there is certainty, the better. \nBut he refused to say whether he was supporting any amendments, adding: \"I do worry that leaving all further scrutiny to the Great Repeal Bill will leave it too late.\" \n7:19pm update : Lord Campbell-Savours \"admits he never thought we would withdraw, but only open a debate about the EU\". \nHe added: \"We should leave and this bill starts the process.\" \n7:06pm update: Cross bench peer Lord Hennessy of Nympsfield lambasted the Brexit White paper as representing the \"coldest of cold print\". \nBut he added: \"We have to crack on with the negotiations.\" \n6:53pm update: Lord Whitty says he does not want his name recorded in supporting the removal of his country from the EU, which offers \"hope for peace and security in a continent which has been scarred by war\". PARLIAMENT TV Lord Whitty says he will not support the Bill \n6:32pm update: Baroness Walmsley says she will be supporting amendments to protect rights of EU nationals in the UK, access to the single market and on an amendment which will allow the British people to have the final say on the deal. \n6:25pm update: Labour's Lord Hain said the \"country is split down by the middle\". \nHe said: \"If the prime minister was acting in the national interest, she would represent remainers too and reprsent a one nation Brexit instead of partisan and hard Brexit. \" \nLord Hain warned the \"peace process could unravel\". PARLIAMENT TV Lord Hain says the country has been split in two \n6:17pm update: Brexiteer Lord Forsyth of Drumlean said: \"Supporters of Brexit have been callled many things - ignorant, gullible, naive, bigoted, uneducated and much worse by people who refuse to accept the result of the referendum. \n\"It is our duty to pass it quickly and without amendments.\" \nHe added: \"The bill before us has been passed unamended and overwhelmingly.\" \n6:11pm update: Lord Eames, former Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, called for Northern Ireland's interests in Brussels not to be \"overlooked and should not be forgotten\". \n6:04pm update: Lord Boswell of Ayno, a non-affiliated peer who chairs the Lords EU committee said: “I think the government would be wise to make a virtue of necessity and involve Parliament from the outset. \n\"As chairman of the European Union Committee, I feel obliged to support the government and if a material attempt to obstruct the bill is made I would vote for it to prevail.” PARLIAMENT TV Lord Boswell of Ayno \n5:59pm update: Cross bencher Lord Birt warned we are \"woefully undeprepared for the gigantic challenges ahead\" and described Theresa May's Brexit White Paper as \"shockingly flimsy\". \nReinforcing his scaremongering, he said: \"We are woefully over optimistic. We are in a weak, not a strong negotiating position\". \nBut he said despite being a passionate remainer, he would vote through the bill, adding: \"We simply must respect the people's choice.\" \n5:51pm update: Baroness Smith of Newnham said she was speaking for the \"people who cannot remember life before the UK was part of the EU and believed our future was part of the EU\". \nShe added: \"There are many people in the UK whose rights should be thought about and secured.\" \nBaroness Smith also pushed for the rights of EU nationals to be considered and \"certainty to be secured\", adding: \"we need to take the lead\". PARLIAMENT TV Lib Dem peer Baroness Smith \n5:36pm update: Cross bencher Lord Gus O’Donnell says the “long term effects once we have left will be negative because we are leaving the single market”. \nHe said remaining in the EU \"boosted economic growth\" before admitting the negotiations will be \"complex\" and the civil service would be \"under huge pressure\". \nHe said: \"As my successor has said they are under huge pressure. The negotiations are extremely complex.\" \nLord O'Donnell called for the Parliament to have a \"serious role\" in the final negotiations. \n5:21pm update : Labour's Lord Rooker warns EU negotiators will \"run rings around Brexiteers\". \nHe says if Theresa May relies on Cabinet members to negotiate with Brussels \"we are sunk\". \nMaking it clear he will be supporting amendments, Lord Rooker says: \"Any success for the UK is tantamount to allowing other member states to try something on.\" PARLIAMENT TV Lord Lawson \n5:15pm update: Lord Lawson of Blaby said a \"complete free trade with no strings attached is unattainable\". \nHe said we must not \"waste time in banging our heads against a brick wall\" and instead accept a \"no trade deal with the EU\". \nThe Tory peer added: \"That is no disaster my Lords. We shall continue to trade with our former partners. There is nothing to be gained by protracted and doomed negotiations. \n\"There is no way EU collectively will accept the sort of trade deal we are offering.\" \nHe added: \"The amendments which are being tailed would mean we embark on an ill-dvised, improper and fundamentally unconstitutional manoeuvre.\" \nLord Lawson said the continent was facing a rise of \"Eurosceptic and anti-establishment popular movements\". \n5:06pm update: Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Campbell hinted for a second referendum during his speech. \nHe said: “It is not to be permitted that the public should be allowed to change its mind? \n\"Is it not to be permitted that there can be any turning back? Parliament is sovereign, and parliament can change its mind. It frequently does so. \n\"And yet the public is not to be allowed the same opportunity. \n\"And remember this my Lords, if it goes wrong, who believes that the public will hold up their hands and say 'it is all our fault because we voted for it'. \n\"They will say it is the 'fault of the politicians, and they will be right to do so.'\" \nLord Campbell of Pittenweem also hinted that some people have attempted to \"bully\" peers into pushing the Brexit bill through. PARLIAMENT TV Baroness Jowell \n4:56pm update: Baroness Jowell said the EU referendum had left the \"country deeply divided\" and it was \"an issue, which served for significant numbers of people, as a proxy for other issues, for fears about their lives\". \nThe former Olympics minister vowed to \"secure the best outcome in perilous circumstances in our country\". \nShe accused the Government of \"damaging the country's national interests by declaring at the outset to leave the single market and customs union\". \nThe Labour peer said: \"How much better would it have been to offer other members of the union a choice.\" \nShe said it was \"urgent\" for parliamentary engagement, adding; \"Our parliament should be that powerful principle. It must make clear its own red lines\". \n4:37pm update: Lord Marks of Henley-on-Thames called on his peers to take action against the Brexit bill. \nThe Lib Dem peer: \"We cannot simply consign Britain's economic future to this head long rush towards Brexit at any cost. \n“We have a responsibility not to next year’s growth figures of inflation figures, but to the prosperity of our country for decades to come.\" PARLIAMENT TV Lord Marks called on his peers to take action against the bill \n4:27pm update: Lord Hill of Oareford said: \" The rest of Europe is not sitting there waiting to take us back. There priority is to work out their future as 27. \n\"Business here in Britain are also not sitting just waiting for something to turn up. \n\"The rest of Europe wants to get on with its post referendum life, business wants to get on with its post referendum life and so, I suggest very gently, should we.\" \nThe Tory peer called for Britain to \"remain on best possible terms with Europe once we have left\", adding \"to increase the chances of this happening, and to avoid dangers of a political crash, we need to have a grown up negotiation. \n\"Our political climate has to change - it must be far more reasoned, far more calm and rational to bring the country together. \n\"We need to think more about bringing remainers and leavers together instead of driving the wedge between us.\" PARLIAMENT TV Lord Hill of Oareford \n4:19pm update: Lord Stevens of Ludgate highlighted the referendum manifesto promised to \"honour the result of the referendum whatever the outcome\". \nThe UKIP peer thanked David Cameron for calling a referendum and congratulated Mrs May for honouring the people's decision to leave the Brussels club. \nHe said: \"Those of us, that is the majority in the referendum, should thank Mr Cameron for bringing out our departure from the EU, even though he did it by mistake.\" \nLord Stevens suggested the EU has become increasingly unstable it is \"better to get out before the house of cards falls down\". PARLIAMENT TV \n4:14pm update: It is reported Theresa May has now left the Lords \n4:12pm update: Lord Wallace of Saltirewarns warned Brexit had a \"potentional for a train crash\". \nThe Lb Dem peer said: \"I cannot recall a point in my lifetime when British foreign policy was as incoherent as it was today. This has the potential for a train crash.\" \n4.05pm update: Lord Cashman says “It is our duty to give a voice to the voiceless\" because we he fears \"we are living in a very dangerous period in this country's history\". \nHe aded: \"The divide has opened up, at a time of rising intolerance and intimidation, especially for minorities\". \nThe Labour peer says he wants \"equality\" for the people that voted to Remain in the European Union. \n\"I will support amendments to protect the single market and customs union and the rights of EU nationals.\" \nLord Cashman revealed he will look to block the triggering of Article 50 if amendments are not passed because he does not believe a \"hard Brexit\" will benefit the country. \nThe remainer says he will not ditch his \"principles because they're unfashionable or unpopular\". PARLIAMENT TV Lord Cashman says he wants to amend the Brexit bill \n3.58pm update: Foreign Foreign Secretary William Hague says although he voted to remain, he will support the bill. \nHe said: \"The referendum was decisive - more people voted to leave the European Union than voted for anything in this country in history.\" \nTaking a swipe at Tony Blair's intervention last week, he said: \"Attempts to refight that referendum are a great error. Asking people to rise up to fight Brexit are a great mistake. \" \nHe vowed to \"listen to voters and obide by the result\". \n3:43pm update: David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead said: \"I am convinced there is no turning back. I have a keen desire to get on with the Article 50 process - I want to know where we are going. \nBut he said: \"The Governemnt will not reveal its hand until negotiations have started. I find this actually frustrating.\" \n\"Let the Government have its bill, but I would caution the government against thinking by introducing this legislation hat it has done all the supreme court desires.\" Brexit: Which parts of the UK had the majority vote? Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain. Getty Images 1 of 8 GREAT YARMOUTH: The town of Great Yarmouth on the East Coast of England voted by 72% to leave the European Union. PARLIAMENT TV Lord Newby is seeking to amend the Brexit bill \n3:37pm udpate: Lord Newby has launched a scathing attack on the PM calling her \"weak\". \nHe said: \"The deliberate decision of the PM to control migration over the membership of the single market means they’ve chosen not to make the economy the priority in negotiations. \n\"Many prominent Brexit supporters, Nigel Farage, Dan Hannan and even the Brexit secretary suggested we remain in the single market. \n\"So the decision to rip us out was a deliberate choice by the PM and one that deserves to be challenged.\" \nThe Liberal Democrat hinted he would be seeking to amend the deal, by saying:\" We do have the power to ask the Commons to think again\". \nHe said it would be \"unthinkable\" for the House of Lords to \"sit on their hands\" and not seek to amend the Brexit Bill. \n3:33pm update : Lord Newby laid in to Theresa May's relationship with US President Donald Trump. \nHe said having a relationship with Trump was \"unsustainable\" because he does not share British values. \nHe said: \"The election of Donald Trump makes an America First policy by this country not only risky but demeaning. The bold assertion that the US shares our values is unsustainable under a Trump president.\" \nThe Lib Dem said Mrs May's rush to visit Trump and \"offering a trinket of a state visit only highlights her weakness\". PARLIAMENT TV Labour's Baroness Smith \n3:20pm update: Baroness Smith of Basildon opens for Labour by admitting \"our role is often misunderstood\". \nShe said: \"We will not be threatened into not fulfilling our normal constitutional role and neither will we be goaded into acting irresponsibly. \n\"We have to have a serious and responsible debate. \" \nInsisting that the House of Commons will have the \"final say\", she said: \"We will not wreck, sabotage, or block the bill before us. \n\"But we will not provide the government with a blank cheque. \n\"If sovereignty is to mean anything it has to mean parliamentary responsibility. \n\"We have to make this Brexit just for the 52 per cent but make this a Brexit that is understood by the 48 per cent.\" PARLIAMENT TV Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, the Leader of the House of Lords, \n3:18pm update: Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, the Leader of the House of Lords, opens the debate saying \"process of leaving EU is a complex one\". But she says the Lords can play a \"valuable role\". \nThe Conservative peer said: \"This Bill is not about revisiting that debate, this Bill responds to the judgment of the Supreme Court that an Act of Parliament is required to authorise ministers to give notice of the decision of the UK to withdraw from the UK\". \nBaroness Evans said: \"There are a huge number of opportunities to help shape the future direction of our country and for the better.\" \n\"Leaving the EU offers our nation many opportunities.\" \nAdding that Theresa May's Brexit will will give her the \"power to leave the EU\", she said the House of Lords wish to \"achieve the right deal for Britain\".
