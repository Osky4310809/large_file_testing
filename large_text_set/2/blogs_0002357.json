It was a handball to everyone watching on TV but not to the ref and he's the boss so we lost the match. \n\"It's very hard to lose this match but it's okay. I think we deserved to draw but they played right to the end and well done to them.\" \nLeicester had a second-half penalty claim turned down when Jamie Vardy went down under a challenge from Tom Heaton, but Ranieri said his players needed to show more composure in front of goal. \nThe Foxes host Manchester United in their next Premier League fixture and Ranieri said: \"We have to react as soon as possible. \n\"The performance was good.

We need a squad with depth that can compete. They are quality players but I think I've got a lot here.\" \nAuba admits: I want out of Dortmund \nOn condemning the Premier League champions to their third successive league loss, Dyche added: \"I know they've had an up and down time this season but they're still a very good side. They've got players who can affect the game, particularly in the attacking positions. I thought we dealt with their threat very well. \n\"We kept knocking on the door all night and eventually got a break for the> Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:19:24.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
