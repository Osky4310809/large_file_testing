The combo of flame-grilled meat, bread, spices, and sauce also takes a lot of culinary skill to get right. After all, no one wants to be on the receiving end of a “dodgy kebab.” \nOur first episode takes us to Mangal 2 in East London. The Dalston kebab shop is as famous for its outspoken Twitter account and celebrity customers (Gilbert and George are regulars) as its authentic Turkish-style meats.
