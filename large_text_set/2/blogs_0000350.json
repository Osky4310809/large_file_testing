We need to douse tension in the country. That’s our agreement,” the source added. \nIn order to avoid further controversies, he explained that this was one of the reasons why the DSS asked Suleman to postpone his coming for interrogation from 10am to 8pm. \n“We needed to manage the crisis and the crowd. That was one of the reasons we agreed that his coming should be devoid of any razzmatazz and long convoy,” the source added. \nReacting to his visit, Suleiman, who refused to speak on whether he was banned from speaking during his interrogation, commended the DSS operatives. \nHe said they exhibited what he described as professionalism in their work. \nSuleman’s spokesperson, Mr. Prank Shuaib, who spoke with one of our correspondents on behalf of his boss, said the cleric was happy with the outcome of the interrogation. \nHe said, “It was a friendly interview that was devoid of any rancour. We need to commend the DSS operatives because they exhibited the highest degree of professionalism during the interview.” \nA source added that though the cleric spent about three hours with the security operatives, the discussion between the two parties was less than one hour. \n“Apostle Suleman spent about three hours in DSS but his discussion with the DG (Director-General, DSS) about his preaching was 55 minutes. It was a very friendly and cordial meeting between Apostle Suleman and the DG of DSS. \nThe source confirmed that the cleric was told to be cautious of his words because he had a large audience, including both Christians and Muslims, who watched his satellite channel, Celebration TV. \n“The DSS categorically told him that there is the tendency for his followers to misinterpret him while mischief makers could, at the same time, capitalise on it to cause crisis in the country,” he added. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:16:57.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
