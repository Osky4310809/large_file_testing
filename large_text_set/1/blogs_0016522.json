The White House announced the surprise move on Tuesday. Manning, who formerly went by “Bradley,” was court-martialed in 2013 for stealing nearly one million classified documents. The former Army intelligence analyst will leave prison in May.

The anti-secrecy group upped the ante by dangling Assange, who resides in exile in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. \nWikiLeaks issued a statement immediately after the announcement, but did not comment on whether Assange will leave his confines in the United Kingdom. \nThe status of the U.S. government’s investigation of the Australian national is not entirely clear. Still up in the air is whether Assange is even the subject of an extradition request from the U.S. government. The Swedish government currently has an extradition request pending in order to question Assange in a sexual assault investigation against him that is ongoing. \nAssange has refused to comply with that request for fear, he says, of being extradited to the U.S. He has said that he believes he could face the death penalty here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:46:14.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
