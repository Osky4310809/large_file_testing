Will Seattle repeat as MLS Cup champions? Sebastian Salazar and Herculez Gomez preview the year ahead for the Sounders. \nThey lost as many games as they won during the regular season. After Week 20, they sat ninth in the Western Conference, 10 points out of a playoff spot. They were the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference playoffs. They didn't register a single shot on goal in MLS Cup 2016. \nThese aren't exactly the most endearing of truths, but in the end, none of it mattered: The Seattle Sounders won 2016 MLS Cup, topping Toronto FC in a dramatic penalty shootout. \nWas it luck? Was it a fluke? Is Seattle bound to return to its early 2016 ways and repeat the Portland Timbers' ignominious feat of missing the playoffs a year after winning MLS Cup? \nWhile the aforementioned data points might suggest otherwise, Seattle's 2016 title run was far from a fluke. That's not to say there wasn't some luck involved; facing a Mauro Diaz-less FC Dallas in the Western Conference semifinals comes to mind. But the Sounders were good value for their MLS Cup triumph on that frigid December night in Toronto.

Just two weeks before the start of the season, star striker Obafemi Martins packed his bags and headed to Chinese Super League club Shanghai Shenhua. Suddenly, instead of the attacking duo of Martins and Clint Dempsey going into their third full season together, the Sounders were left with Dempsey trying to make things work with rookie forward Jordan Morris. \nMorris arrived in Seattle to immense anticipation, with fans expecting him to score routinely in his first full season, but that was entirely unrealistic. \nSeattle was hindered in other areas as well. When designated player Nelson Valdez wasn't bothered by injuries, he couldn't buy a goal; the Paraguayan ended the regular season with a goose egg in the goal column. The absence of center-back Roman Torres until late August, due to a long-term knee injury sustained in September 2015, was also a huge factor. Plus, there was Dempsey's time away from the Sounders during the Copa America Centenario, when the Texan missed five matches: one victory, one draw and three defeats. Herculez Gomez evaluates the MLS rankings ahead of the new season, deciding who was properly rated and who was snubbed. \nIt's easy to see why Seattle was near rock bottom on July 24 after an embarrassing 3-0 loss at Sporting Kansas City, but then Seattle started having the kind of season that was expected of them in terms of results. And there was nothing accidental about it. \nA team doesn't fluke its way into signing a creative No. 10 like Uruguay international Nicolas Lodeiro from Boca Juniors. And a club doesn't fluke its way into making a major coaching decision midway through the season; out went longtime coach Sigi Schmid and in came interim Brian Schmetzer, who quickly instituted a formation change -- from a 4-3-3 to a 4-2-3-1 -- to optimize the role of Lodeiro as a No. 10. \"Lodeiro's arrival to the team was very important for Seattle,\" Montreal Impact midfielder Hernan Bernardello told ESPN FC. \"But so were other players like Valdez, Morris and Torres. They all played well at the end of the season.\" \nBy this point, Morris was a different player than the one who started the season. Schmid's decision to stick with the youngster would prove massive in the second half of the season, even if Schmid did not get to reap the rewards. The Stanford product's holdup play improved. He combined better with teammates and relished the chance to run at defenders. Dempsey's heart ailment forced the young striker to mature, and he responded with aplomb. Nicolas Lodeiro's arrival marked the beginning of the Seattle Sounders' turnaround in 2016. \nAlso of note was the return of Torres to the fold, not just in defense alongside Chad Marshall but in the locker room as well . That defensive cohesion was another important piece to the Seattle puzzle. \n\"The Sounders were able to defend better as a unit toward the end of the season, which is what eventually won them the cup,\" said Clark. \nWhile Seattle's late charge into the playoffs fuels the argument that the MLS regular season \"doesn't matter that much,\" that is a discussion for a different day. Seattle peaked when it mattered most. The Sounders team that closed the season with eight wins in their final 13 games -- and then deservedly beat Sporting KC, FC Dallas and the Colorado Rapids in the playoffs en route to MLS Cup -- hardly had the look of a .500 team that lucked its way to a championship. \nThe way Seattle starts the 2017 season should make that very clear. \nArch Bell covers CONCACAF for ESPN FC.
