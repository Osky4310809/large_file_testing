PHOTO FROM MANASES CARPIO \nMANILA, Philippines - President Duterte rushed to Davao City from an engagement in Cebu last night to see his 10th grandchild named Marco Digong, with the nickname Stonefish. \nPresidential daughter and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio gave birth to the baby boy at the Davao Doctors Hospital at around noon yesterday. \nHer husband, lawyer Mans Carpio, welcomed the birth of Stonefish, their third child, announcing on his Facebook account that at 12:56 p.m. yesterday, she delivered a healthy baby boy. \n“Stonefish weighs 2.42 kilos or 5.3 pounds. He was delivered through a cesarean section. Thank you Lord for the gift of life. Mayor Inday Sara is ‘stable’ and ‘generally fine’,” Carpio wrote. \nAsked to react to his grandson’s name, Duterte said: “Ewan ko ba bakit ganun si Inday (I don’t know why Inday is like that),” Duterte said. \nThe couple’s eldest, eight-year-old Mikhaila Maria, is nicknamed “Sharky,” while their second child, four-year-old Matteo Lucas, is also known as “Stingray.”   \nDuterte said his family follows a practice wherein a newborn child is “sold” to his grandparents. The one who wins the “bidding” will give the name of the child. \nPresidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said the President is delighted with the arrival of his newest apo (grandchild) and glad that both Sara and Stonefish are healthy and stable. \nThe President has five grandchildren with his eldest son Davao City vice mayor Paolo and two from son Sebastian. \n“The arrival of the Chief Executive’s newest apo Stonefish strengthens PRRD’s (Duterte’s acronym) resolve to leave a legacy of a Philippines (that is) safe and secure from drugs and heinous crimes to future generation of Filipinos,” Abella added. \nThe mayor was initially carrying triplets but earlier lost the two other babies and only baby Stonefish survived until she gave birth yesterday.
