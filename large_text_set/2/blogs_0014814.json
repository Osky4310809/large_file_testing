Here's what's weighing on our writers' minds. \nOn what we learned from the West Coast swing: \nIf the job of the West Coast swing is to set the table for the upcoming season, consider that mission rather accomplished this year. \nAfter all, what more do you want? Dustin Johnson is a newly christened world No. 1, and fellow top names Jordan Spieth and Hideki Matsuyama immediately preceded him in the winner’s circle. Justin Thomas won twice, and Jon Rahm established himself as one of the newest rising stars. \nIt’s been a strong start to the calendar year from golf’s upper echelon, even with Rory McIlroy on the disabled list and without much from the newly dethroned Jason Day . \nNow the scene shifts east, where one question will inch closer to the forefront of everyone’s mind: How many days until the Masters? - Will Gray \nOn the power of parity : \nNews last week that Tiger Woods wouldn’t be playing this week’s Genesis Open , an event that benefits his foundation, or next week’s Honda Classic nearly broke the Internet. \nIf the buzz on social media is to be believed, without Woods the game’s not worth watching. Never mind that Dustin Johnson lapped the field at Riviera Country Club by five strokes to overtake Jason Day atop the world ranking, or that Jordan Spieth went one better last week on his way to a six-stroke romp at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, or that Rory McIlroy’s return is just two weeks away. \nParity, as opposed to individual dominance, may not be everyone’s favorite, but it’s certainly entertaining. – Rex Hoggard \nOn Ha Na Jang's showmanship : \nHa Na Jang is a natural born entertainer. If she was nervous coming home Sunday at the ISPS Handa Women’s Australian Open, you wouldn’t have known it. She seemed to relish the spotlight with her name moving to the top of the leaderboard. She played to the crowd and played to the cameras, and she put on a hell of a show winning her fourth LPGA title. \nThe return of Jang’s showmanship was a freshening breeze. - Randall Mell \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:56:57.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
