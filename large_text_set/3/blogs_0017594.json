But TOWIE's Lauren Goodger is going one better - by helping her boyfriend set up a business for his life after prison. \nThe reality TV star, 30, took to Instagram on Sunday where she happily promoted Joey Morrisson's range of watches that'll be for sale once he's released from HMP Highpoint South in Newmarket, Suffolk, later this year. \nSharing a snap of a selection of time pieces, she said: \"Follow @joeymorrisson for all luxury watches at the best prices, also jewellery such as rings, chains and more. Mens and Womens Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Patek Phillipee, Cartier and more [sic].\" \nThe eyebrow-raising post clocked-up more than 100 likes before she deleted it after followers questioned whether the items were illegitimate -something Lauren emphatically denies.

And no they ain’t stolen what a pathetically unintelligent question to ask.\" \nA second post said: “@logue_david and your point is? Say more about what? Yes his in prison and has more going for himself than most people out here. So maybe keep your opinions to yourself.” \nJust a day earlier she uploaded a teaser post, which featured a picture of her criminal beau. She captioned it:\"Mine @joeymorrisson as he can't put his own up ❤ follow as watches to be uploaded soon\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T17:19:18.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
