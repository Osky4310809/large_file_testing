After all, July 16 is a full three months after the show usually comes back. But in the Game of Thrones world, winter isn’t just coming, it’s here. Understandably, the premiere had to be delayed to accommodate winter filming . But Kit Harington is promising those extra few months will pay off . \n“Yes, I’m gonna say, ‘Yes,'” Kit told The Huffington Post in an exclusive interview when they asked if the wait would be worth it. “I mean I hope it is. I certainly did more this season than I’ve ever done. I think every actor on it did more action, had more action, had more scenes.” \nPlus, the show’s ever increasing popularity and this season’s shorter run also meant more money per episode. \nAnd some really cool effects we can look forward to. “They spent an increasing amount of money on less episodes,” Harington explained, “so it’s gonna be much bigger in scale, the CGI … we’re trying new things, experimenting with new camera techniques. I think we’re trying to break boundaries and push past boundaries in these final two seasons.”\n\nBreak boundaries, huh? We’ve got a suspicion that they also might be breaking a certain wall if that melting-ice-block Facebook reveal video was anything to go by. \n\nBut the wall coming down isn’t the only thing we’re looking forward to. According to Harington, certain characters are finally (FINALLY!) going to be meeting up.\n“They really focused [the show] because less characters are coming in, and they’re focusing in on the existing ones, and there are lots of people who cross paths, and that’s something that I think the audience has been waiting for for a long time.” \nWe can’t help but wonder which characters he means. Sure, season 7 spoilers are everywhere and we could just check those, but what fun would that be? We’d rather come up with our own ideas. Maybe Jon and Tyrion will meet back up? Could we see Danaerys and Sansa ever work together? \nThe possibilities on Game of Thrones are pretty endless. There’s only one thing we know for sure: We. Can’t. Wait. Unfortunately, we’ll have to. \n\nIs it July yet?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:27:38.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
