I did not give them a chance at all but now we have all seen that the road to Russia 2018 is going to be rougher. For Cameroon to excel without Liverpool’s Joel Matip and the trio of Eric Choupo-Moting, Andre Onana and Alan Nyom, that’s incredible.” super eagles \nThe former Abia State governor urged the Super Eagles to remember the ill fated journey to Italia ’90 during which the Indomitable Lions stopped Nigeria Inspite of the death of Sam Okwaraji. \n“History must not repeat itself. During the Italia ’90 qualifiers, Cameroon and Nigeria were in the same group. We needed just a draw in Yaounde to advance having beaten them 2-0 at the Adamasingba Stadium, Ibadan, the day Austin Eguavoen scored his first goal for the Eagles. It did not happen. Peter Rufai was dropped at the airport by Clemens Westerhof, David Ngodigha was injured in the game that turned out to be Aloysius Agu’s debut. \n“And the Lions were at the time Nations Cup champions having won in 1988. François Oman Biyik sealed it with a header that gave the hosts a 1-0 victory,” Kalu warned. \nHe has also volunteered to open up talks between former captain Vincent Enyeama and Rohr. \n“I think there is communication gap between Rohr and Enyeama. I am ready to bring them together.We need good keepers to support Carl Ikeme. The Eagles also need to play friendlies with Senegal and Burkina Faso. They are francophone and play like the Indomitable Lions,” Kalu said.
