ISIS,” Colbert said during his monologue. “They try so hard. Sorry, ISIS. If you want to get on the list, you’ve got to publish photos of Trump’s inauguration crowd. Then he’ll be really, really angry at you. So sad. Hidden victims.”\nThe FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017\nColbert’s joke underscores a larger point: Trump has had strong words for the Islamic State, but, of late, his strongest words have been for the media. He has been battling them since he was on the campaign trail, even banning several news organizations, including The Washington Post, from campaign events.\nAnd the tumult didn’t end when candidate Trump became President Trump.\n[ Trump, in CIA visit, attacks media for coverage of his inaugural crowds ]\nA day after Trump’s inauguration, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the media had played down the size of the crowds. He’s called reporters “among the most dishonest human beings on earth .” Earlier this month, he speculated that the media was covering up terrorist attacks .\nOf course, members of the media have responded, saying they’re not too fond of Trump’s tactics, either.\n“Trump’s attacks on the American press as ‘enemies of the American people’ are more treacherous than Richard Nixon’s attacks on the press,” former Post reporter Carl Bernstein told CNN . Trump’s comments are reminiscent of “dictators and authoritarians, including Stalin, including Hitler.”\nAn Islamic State flag. (Dado Ruvic/Reuters) In an editorial, the New York Times said “the language that Mr. Trump deployed on Friday is more typically used by leaders to refer to hostile foreign governments or subversive organizations. It also echoed the language of autocrats who seek to minimize dissent.”\nIt’s unclear what tactic Trump intends to use to thwart the United States’ new No. 1 enemy, although Colbert pointed out that within days of declaring the media the country’s enemy, Trump announced a new national security adviser, Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster.\n“I swear to do everything in my power to protect the nation from America’s enemies, which I am being told are CBS and the failing New York Times,” Colbert said, mocking McMaster’s introductory remarks. “Wow, things have really changed since I was in the Army five minutes ago.”\nRead more:\n‘Never fjorget’: Colbert mocks Trump’s Sweden flub, honors ‘all the people who did not suffer’\nStephen Colbert channels Keyser Söze to blast Trump’s Russia ties\nStephen Colbert calls Donald Trump a liar — over and over and over again\nJon Stewart mocks Trump, slams his first days in the White House: ‘This nation is in crisis’", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/business/trump-calls-the-news-media-the-enemy-of-the-people.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzKiSoSn9qA?start=5&feature=oembed", "https://twitter.com/CBS", "https://twitter.com/@CleveWootson", "https://twitter.com/NBCNews", "https://twitter.com/nytimes", "https://twitter.com/ABC", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832708293516632065", "https://twitter.com/CNN"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:50:47.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
