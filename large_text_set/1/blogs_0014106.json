While only a very weak 38 percent of the mass population trust institutions in France, a mere 56 percent of the category described as the 'informed public' still maintains its faith in the same institutions. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T09:00:19.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
