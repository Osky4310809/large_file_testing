Leila De Lima on drug-related charges as \"political persecution.\" \nIn an article published on March 21, the New York Times published “Becoming Duterte: The Making of a Philippine Strongman” that narrated the president's rise from his elite childhood in Davao City to his election as its mayor and later to his capture of Malacañang.   \nThe article, written by Richard Paddock, told the story of the president’s anti-drugs crusade and his violent vision that the article alleged has been turned into a national policy. \n“The dissonance between the image of the gentle, caring grandfather and the brutal strongman spilling blood on the streets is just one of many in a common-man president who was born to the elite and has lived a life surrounded by violence,” the article said. \nAbella, without offering any evidence, insinuated that some moneyed individuals might be behind the article which he described as a “well-paid hack job.” \n\"One would expect more from The New York Times,\" he said as he described the piece as a \"well-paid hack job for well-heeled clients with shady motives.\" \nHe said that the article “cynically and unfairly” narrated Duterte’s rise to power in the context of the article. \nAbella said that the chief executive did not engage in “western liberal niceties” to push forward his agenda of rebuilding the country. \nAs an outsider, Duterte vowed to reduce poverty, address crime, corruption and illegal drugs and reinforce agreements with Muslim insurgents and communist rebels. \nHe lamented that the author omitted in his story the projects the president made when he was still mayor of Davao City. \n“Davao City, under the leadership of President Duterte as mayor, is hailed as one of the safest cities in the world where residents follow an anti-smoking and a midnight alcohol ban,” he said, as he also enumerated some of Duterte’s initiatives as mayor such as Central 911, “Lingap Para sa Mahirap,” health assistance, free primary and secondary education in public schools and access to college education for poor students.
