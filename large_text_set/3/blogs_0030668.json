The administration says they have no records of the reports. \nDemocrats are happy with this status quo? \nApparently, this isn’t the first time this judge has done this. \nNebraska Judge Jeffrey Marcuzzo, who set Vargas-Perez’s bail at only $5,000, has a history of setting low bonds for illegal immigrants accused of heinous crimes. \nHow many innocent people need to be victimized by immigrants both legal and illegal before we finally recognize and address the huge holes in our immigration system? \nIllegal aliens commit a disproportionate amount of crime in this country. There’s no way around that. \nWhile we have seen studies that show legal immigrants commit less crime than U.S. born citizens, that doesn’t really address the fact that a lot of crime is being committed that is preventable. \nAlso, there is no excuse for letting anyone, immigrant or not, out of jail that easily for such a serious crime. \nFor some reason, I don’t think they are letting American citizens off the hook so easily over there in Omaha. \nLooks like this guy is gone and that poor young girl will never see justice carried out. \nShameful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:46:30.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
