Grail spun out of the genetic sequencing giant Illumina to develop its blood-based cancer testing service and Illumina said today in a release the startup would be working with Goldman Sachs to help shepherd the round for a “contemplated” additional financing. \nGrail leverages Illumina’s gene sequencing tech to potentially spot any kind of cancer in the body before symptoms appear. \nWhile this type of technology isn’t necessarily new, it has never been used in early-stage detection and Grail will need the cash to continue development of its testing, particularly for the previously announced Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas study slated to analyze at least 7,000 cancer patients and compare them to 3,000 healthy individuals as well as other large-scale clinical trials – one possibly involving half a million people based in the U.K. \nMost biotech startups need more cash in earlier stages to make any kind of headway — Grail raised a whopping $100 million for its Series A. But a billion or two dollar raise gives the startup an avalanche of money to work with and would put it far ahead of many other companies in the space. \nIllumina plans to give Grail more independence as well with the raise, eventually owning less than 20 percent of the company, and withdrawing members from Grail’s board of directors. The gene sequence company also said it believes Grail is set to become one of its largest customers over time, both by providing royalties on future testing and through Illumina’s appreciation in ownership. \n“We are honored to have world-class investors who support our goal of reducing global cancer mortality through early detection — especially the invaluable support we received from Illumina during our start-up phase – and we look forward to the next phase of our growth,” Grail CEO and former Google executive Jeff Huber said.
