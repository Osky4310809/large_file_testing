Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA student says she was left looking 'like a burns victim' after an alleged cock-up with the glue in her hair extensions caused her blonde locks to fall out. \nHolly Jane Harbottle says her mum treated her to the £170 hairdo to combat her anxiety problems - but now she has been left even more depressed after allegedly faulty extensions left her with a huge bald patch. \nThe 19-year-old claims she now has to wear a wig and is scared to leave the house after the bonded extensions left her hair 'ruined'. \nBut the hairdresser who fitted the extensions said Holly was to blame for the damage because she 'didn't care for them properly'.

I'm afraid to even leave the house because I look terrible. \n\"This was supposed to something that gave me my confidence back but instead it's just made things worse. I hate it. \n\"She was recommended to me by a friend but right from the start, it didn't seem right. She was really rude when she came round to the house to do it. \n\"She got out this rusty-looking set of straighteners and was in and out in under an hour. She didn't give me any advice at all. It was a new experience for me and it was horrible. \n\"We paid for 22 inches but that's definitely not what we got. I've never had extensions before and I can't afford to have them done again. Her blonde locks came out in clumps (Photo: Mercury Press and Media Ltd) \n\"She's absolutely ruined my hair. I got in touch with her within a week to complain that a couple of the extensions had come out but she just said it wasn't anything to worry about. \n\"I've got bad anxiety. I thought extensions would help boost my confidence. It's had the opposite effect. In some of the photos, I look like a burns victim. \n\"I cried for hours while my mum [Andrea, 46] took the remaining clotted s**t out of my hair. Now I have to wear a wig.\" \nHolly Jane, a beauty student, contacted the hairdresser again this week as the problems with her extensions worsened. \nShe took several shocking pictures showing the extent of the damage, and claims other customers who have used the same person have come forward with similar stories.

They're all over the place and that's how they've got clotted. \n\"She needs to be stopped because she is just ripping people off and doesn't deserve a penny. \n\"My hair is in poorer condition now then it was before she fitted the extensions. It was falling out within days and when I washed it it was all matted and horrible. \n\"I have messaged her numerous times and she just makes no sort of effort to try and come and sort it out. She told me to use argan oil and that made it worse. \n\"My mum is really upset by it too. Every time I look in the mirror I just burst into tears.\" \nHolly Jane said she intends to visit the Citizens' Advice Bureau to see if she can report the hairdresser, from Sunderland, to Trading Standards \nThe hairdresser said she had had been forced to remove her business page from Facebook after receiving threats. She says she was left with a bald patch (Photo: Mercury Press and Media Ltd) \nThe hairdresser said: \"It's absolutely ridiculous. I done her hair over five months ago. It was September 22. The first week there was a couple that came out. I said to keep an eye on it and that if any more came out, I would come round and take a look at it. I've heard nothing else until last week. \n\"She sent me the pictures and I said I needed to come out and have a look. She asked me what would happen then and I said I'd remove them for her. Next thing I know she's put some stuff on Facebook. \n\"I was getting inundated with abuse from people so I had to take the page down. Then on Monday I saw that her mum had actually cut bits of her hair out, for which there was no reason. It would have taken a few hours, but I could have taken them out. \n\"The problem is, she hasn't looked after them from the start. Extensions have got to be looked after. They've got to be pushed through, separated, and maintenance checked. She wouldn't pay for that. I told her to use a soft brush, no conditioner on the roots. She's not been in touch for five months and then, all of a sudden, this. \n\"I don't see why I should have taken them out for free when it's down to her not looking after them. Extensions don't just go like that. I've got plenty of happy customers. If somebody's not looking after something, it's not down to me. \n\"I was quite willing to go out and look at it last week. If she'd rang me before that, I'd have gone out.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:24:10.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
