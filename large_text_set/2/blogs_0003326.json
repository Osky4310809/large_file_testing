This is notable because Google hasn’t even issued the February patch to Pixel or Nexus devices yet, not even in the Android 7.1.2 beta release which started rolling out two days ago.\nSee also: Android Nougat update: when will you get it? 3 weeks ago The Xperia security patch is dated February 1 and comes as part of build number 39.2.A.0.417 for the Xperia XZ and X Performance and build number 34.2.A.0.311 for the Xperia X and X Compact. The Xperia XA does not seem to be getting the update.\nWe can’t even tell you what is addressed in the patch because Google hasn’t posted February details on the Android security bulletin page yet. While this might be a nice little win Xperia X family owners, the stalled Nougat update for various Xperia Z series devices doesn’t seem to have been resumed yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:51:44.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
