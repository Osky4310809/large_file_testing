Franklin the Shiba Inu \nFranklin the Shiba Inu keeps designer Justin Maller grounded We&apos;d like to introduce you to Franklin the Shiba Inu, whose human is New York-based freelance designer and illustrator Justin Maller . \n\nDogs are like people, but furrier and more awesome\nJustin Maller \"Being a freelancer is lonely,\" Maller admits. \"Usually, there&apos;s no other people around. This has its pros and cons – people are great for loneliness but usually a pain in the ass for everything else.\n\"Dogs are like people, but furrier and more awesome – they don&apos;t talk back, learn tricks, do cute shit constantly and basically unequivocally think you&apos;re great. They also force you to get up from your desk and leave the house a few times a day to go on things called &apos;walks&apos;.\"\n02. Sloane the Vizsla \nSloane is quick to let her human Steve Fisher know when he's been working too long Sloane the Vizsla makes the life of human Steve Fisher , the founder of Canadian UX, content strategy and web technology consultancy the Republic of Quality, all the better.  \n\"Sloane is a high-energy Vizsla that loves to go for hikes in Vancouver&apos;s north shore rain forest with me pretty much every day [photographic evidence can be found on Instagram @hellofisher ]. She’s quick to let me know when I’ve been working too long by climbing up onto the chair with me. My office is made 100 per cent better with her around. #ilovemydog.\"\n03. Mesa and Gina the Chihuahuas \nSmall but mighty, Chihuahuas Mesa (left) and Gina (right) bring artist Brynn Metheney joy throughout her working day Small but mighty, these two tiny Chihuahuas are great company for concept artist and illustrator Brynn Metheney . Full of personality, Mesa has her own Instagram account and we can imagine it won&apos;t be long until Gina, a recent addition to the family, does too!\n\"Mesa is my tiny, almost 5 pound Chihuahua. She might be little but she has a very important job! She reminds me to go outside throughout the day so I don’t stay indoors too much. Her and her cousin Gino (a new addition I recently adopted) both keep me company in the studio. Working solo and on tight deadlines can be stressful and lonely. These two bring me so much joy throughout my work day. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;d do without their company. Mesa might be the smaller of the two but she’s definitely top dog…er, or potato.” \n04. Ziggy the Bulldog \n\"Ziggy is the glue that holds the whole operation together,\" says Frost Life is never dull for web designer Brad Frost with Ziggy the Bulldog around. \"I work from home with my brother and my wife who runs her own business. Ziggy is the glue that holds the whole operation together. His snores contribute to conference calls, his gas clears rooms (it&apos;s his way of telling us we need to get up and stretch our legs), and his hilarious presence ensures there&apos;s never a dull moment in the office.\" \n06. Scruffy and Duff the Shih Tzus (cross Spaniel) \nScruffy (left) and Duff belong to podcast host Debbie Millman Adorable creatures are Scruffy (left) and Duff provide their human, author, educator, brand strategist and host of the podcast Design Matters Debbie Millman with nothing but uncondititonal love. Scruffy, a male, is a Shih Tzu while Duff, the female, is a mix of that and a Spaniel.\nIn an interview with Core77 , Millman was asked about design and her dogs: \"On their best day, brands could aspire to be like dogs, evoking that sense of connectivity,\" she said. \n07. Freddie the Jack Russell \nFreddie is Creative Bloq's unofficial office dog – don't be fooled by those big brown eyes! We&apos;re huge fans of our four-legged canine friends here at Creative Bloq, but, sadly, CB HQ is unable to allow them into the office. However, that doesn&apos;t mean we don&apos;t have an office dog. This furry fella, eight-year-old Freddie the Jack Russell, has recently started joining the CB team on monthly meetings, stealing the hearts of all the staff in the local coffee joint and luring them into a false sense of security with his big brown dinner plate eyes. \nHe helps his human, CB associate editor Kerrie Hughes, keep the world&apos;s top design website running by keeping her very alert and on her toes. How so? By regularly stealing unsuspecting lunch-goers&apos; sandwiches and generally being a total menace. \n08. Mattie the Australian Shepherd \nMattie is Paula Scher's absolute favourite Mattie the Australian Shepherd accompanies Pentagram partner Paula Scher to the office every day. During in an interview with Fast Co Design , Scher was asked what the favourite thing she owned was: \"My dog! He’s an Australian shepherd, my fourth one. Their names have all started with M–Matty, Mickey, Molly, and Mimi.\"\n09. Sir Oliver Ottoman of the High Country the Havanese Sir Oliver Ottoman of the High Country, or Ollie for short, is always around to provide his designer human Stanley Hainsworth with some creative inspiration. The founder and chief creative officer of Tether, a creative, cross-discipline studio, Hainsworth is never far away from Ollie, who (as you can see from his Instagram account ) accompanies him in the office and on design jobs regularly.\n10. Olivia the Golden Retriever mix \n\"Olivia is the most reliable creative partner we have,\" says Neo Pangea founder Brett Bagenstose Olivia the Golden Retriever mix is the resident office dog at digital boutique Neo Pangea . \"Always ready for a brainstorm or a belly rub, Olivia is the most reliable creative partner we have… just don’t leave food out on the counter,\" says Brett Bagenstose, founder and self-titled &apos;Baron of Pixels&apos; at Neo Pangea. \nRelated articles: \n10 ways to make your desk more comfortable What time should designers get up in the morning? 10 ways to get a designer to date you ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:47:25.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
