The Touch Bar may not be a must-have but you can do some cool things with it. \nThere have also been rumors that Apple plans to get rid of the Home button , so it probably makes sense that Apple makes use of the area, though some would argue that it would be better if they reduce the size of the device instead. It will be interesting to see how Apple plans to use the function area on the iPhone. Apple could also use the function area display to embed the Touch ID as I am still not convinced that Apple will take the leap and embed it in the OLED display. Apple has also already started training us by replacing the physical Home button with the pressure-sensitive button (for the record, I still don’t like it ) in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. \nFolks at Tech Driven Times have created a new iPhone 8 concept video which features the function area, which they’ve aptly called the Adaptive Function bar . The concept video showcases some use cases of the function bar, such as the ability to use it to unlock the iPhone using the embedded Touch ID, access playback controls while watching videos and the ability to zoom into a photo by swiping on the slider. The iPhone 8 concept also features very thin bezels on the sides and a much smaller bezel at the top. \nCheck out the iPhone 8 concept video below, and let me know what you think in the comments below. Are you excited about the possibility of the iPhone 8 coming with a Touch bar?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:05:03.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
