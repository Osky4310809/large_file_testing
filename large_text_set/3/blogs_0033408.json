He’s been a fire chief, volunteer, safety guru, and mentor to new firefighters. Three years ago, Dan raised almost $10,000 for a fellow firefighter who lost his home in a fire. He’s part of everyone’s family, always willing to lend a hand. \nIn December 2016, Dan was diagnosed with cancer. After spending his entire life giving to his community – it’s time to give back to Dan. Chive Charities and the Green Ribbon Members donated $5,000 to the Fairview Township Fire Department so they can support their brother fighting for his life. We’re also spreading the word about a benefit happening THIS SATURDAY – head over to Fairview Township Fire Department’s Facebook page to learn more about the benefit, drop by if you’re in the area this weekend, donate if you’d like, or leave some words of encouragement for Dan. He could use a little pick-me-up. Chive Pennsylvania will be on-hand to make sure it’s a party worthy of a legend such as Dan. \nKeep fighting, Dan.
