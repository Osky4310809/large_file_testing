Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday.\nThe desperately-needed new bridge, which carries the Brooklyn Queens Expressway over the Newtown Creek, has been under construction since 2015 and is expected to open in April. And then the state will dynamite the decrepit 78-year-old bridge, said Cuomo.\nCrews will explode the Brooklyn and Queens approaches of the old bridge and then grab it by the middle to haul it away, said officials.\nBlowing the bridge up instead of taking it apart will save the state several months of work.\n“Think of the commuter point of view, every day, every hour matters. so let’s find out a way to accelerate it, get it done,” said Cuomo.\nThe first phase of the bridge cost taxpayers $550 million. The state will now issue a request for proposal for the second span, and officials expect that half to be done in 2020. In the meantime, both directions of traffic will drive on the first span.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:13:39.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
