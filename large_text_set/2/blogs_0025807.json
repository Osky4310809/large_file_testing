Itâ€™s an historic moment in the 97-year-old labelâ€™s history, as it collapses Menswear and Womenswear into a single show. Though details remain scarce so far, we have Highsnobietyâ€™s Digital Fashion Editor Alec Leach on the ground in Milan, who will be reporting live with all the deets.\nTo whet your appetite for whatâ€™s to come, weâ€™ve noted everything we know so far below. Highsnobiety will also be live streaming Gucci FW17 right here at 3pm CET / 2pm GMT / 9am EST, or you can follow the action on Facebook .\nBIG QUESTION. Today's #Gucci fashion show invitation, a 12\" record with gatefold cover feat: ðŸŽ™SIDE A) #FlorenceWelch reads from \"Songs of Innocence and Experience\" by WILLIAM BLAKE. ðŸ”ˆSIDE B) #AsapRocky reads \"A love letter from Frederick Wentworth to Anne Elliot\" from Persuasion by JANE AUSTEN. \nA post shared by Joerg Koch/ 032c (@032c) on Feb 22, 2017 at 12:26am PST \n\nAccording to the â€˜gram, the invite for Gucci FW17 is a vinyl record, and the sleeve features words by CocoCapitan . Of course, it bears a striking resemblance to Jim Joeâ€™s signature scrawling that made an appearance on Drakeâ€™s cover art for his 2015 surprise mixtape, If Youâ€™re Reading This Itâ€™s Too Late .\nWeâ€™re assuming the vinyl invite features the FW17 show soundtrack, and Gucci has already revealed that the likes of Florence & the Machine and A$AP Rocky are featured. According to Twitter, the record includes Florence Welsch reciting William Blakeâ€™s Songs of Innocence and of Experience .\nListen to the #GucciFW17 Audio Tracks by @flo_tweet & @asvpxrocky on the Gucci App after the show, live at 3PM CET https://t.co/UI1l2KPvL8 pic.twitter.com/8YpVaNf1g1 \nâ€” gucci (@gucci) February 22, 2017 \n\n2/2 â€¢ A garden inhabited by signs, symbols and archetypes invoking and recalling remote worlds. See the #GucciFW17 womenâ€™s and menâ€™s runway show by #AlessandroMichele live from Milan tomorrow at 3PM CET. \nA post shared by Gucci (@gucci) on Feb 21, 2017 at 6:14am PST \n\nItâ€™s no secret that Gucciâ€™s creative director Alessandro Michele loves his art. Take one look at his Instagram , and youâ€™ll see he has been posting snaps of Italian art, antiques, and antiquities since long before a wave of success carried him to the forefront of fashion influence. So far, GUCCI has teased an intriguing still life of botanic goodness. You could easily mistake it for a historic Flemish Baroque painting but the subtly placed iPhone charger says otherwise.\nMake sure you keep your eyes firmly fixed on this page as we continue to update it with more coverage from Gucci FW17.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:59:33.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
