The attack killed six people, and injured eighteen others, five of whom remain hospitalized. Candlelight vigils were held across Canada Monday night to pay tribute the multiple victims of the mosque shooting. \nWWE’s Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens, both Quebec natives, honoured the victims of this tragedy during WWE Raw in their own way, by wearing black armbands emblazoned with white fleurs-de-lis on a patch of blue (representative of Quebec’s flag, for all our non-Canadian friends who might be wondering).\n\n\nSami, who is of both Syrian and Canadian descent, sent out this tweet of solidarity with the Muslim community in Quebec:\nMy heart is with the Muslims of Quebec. \nMon coeur est avec les musulmans du Québec.\nقلبي مع المسلمين في كيبيك.\n— Sami Zayn (@iLikeSamiZayn) January 30, 2017 \n\n\nOwens also expressed his sadness and disgust on Twitter, saying “Ignorance and intolerance have no place here,” and urging people to take care of one another:\nJe viens tout juste d'apprendre ce qui s'est passé à Sainte-Foy. Je suis absolument dégouté. Je ne sais vraiment pas quoi dire de plus.\n— Kevin Owens (@FightOwensFight) January 30, 2017 \nMes pensées sont avec les familles des victimes et avec le Québec au complet. J'ai le coeur vide en ce moment. Prenons soin l'un de l'autre.\n— Kevin Owens (@FightOwensFight) January 30, 2017 \nL'ignorance et l'intolérance n'ont pas leur place chez nous. Nous sommes au-dessus de ça et nous DEVONS le rester. Parlez à vos enfants.\n— Kevin Owens (@FightOwensFight) January 30, 2017 \n\nAlexandre Bissonette — the man responsible for the barbaric attack — is currently being charged with six counts of first-degree murder, and five counts of attempted murder. Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau referred to the attack as a “despicable act of terror.” According to the RCMP, terror-related charges could be coming, pointing out that the investigation is still ongoing.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:57:17.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
