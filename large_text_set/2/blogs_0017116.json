It’s one of my favourite places to eat in London – a real treat of a venue, we went last year and loved it and have wanted to go back for a night out for a long time. I love the bar area with the light up tree, the restaurant is on the 38 th and 39 th floors of Bishopsgate and overlooks the whole of London so the views are spectacular, and the adjacent tower had light up hearts – a very cute wow factor for the night! We enjoyed some of their signature cocktails (love the Lychee and coconut martini) and of course their sushi. The spicy tuna roll is delicious and the choice of seafood on the menu is vast. We really liked the lobster tempura and the cod with sweet potato broth, the duck gyozas were full of flavour too. I decided to wear one of my new season Lipsy London dresses and I think it had a oriental feel to it, what do you think? Embroidery and flowers are big this season, and I like the high neck and the way the dress clings to your figure (in the right places!) As the neck of the dress is so high, I decided to have a high and very messy bun, otherwise I thought I might end up looking like I had no neck! I accessorised my Valentines outfit with my Top Shop fluffy blue bag and favourite Sophia Webster shoes. I kept my accessories to a minimum, no earrings, just some rings, and this made the dress the focal point of the outfit. I used my new Windle and Moodie Compact Pro Mini Irons to get the tufts of hair to fall around my face in the right places, I also straightened and sprayed the tufts of hair popping out of the bun, to make them stand up (a trick I picked up from a recent photoshoot). My make up was pretty fresh and natural, I didn’t go too heavy with my eyes as the dress had a lot going on. As there was some pink in the flowers on the dress I chose a Revlon pink lipstick (named Dessert 712) which is one of the new ultra gel HD lippys. These fab lipsticks are so lightweight and moisturizing, they feel like a lip balm. You can get more info about the range (there are 15 colours to choose from!) here: http://www.revlon.com/products/lips/lip-color/revlon-ultrahd-gellipcolor You know I love to experiment with my eye colours, well I decided to wear a light blue contact lens from Mesmereyez (to compliment with the dress of course!) – the colour is called ‘blue slate’ and you can get them here: I love being able to change my eye colour, the contacts don’t irritate my eyes or make them water, so long as you are careful putting them in, and of course, taking them out, then why the hell not! Favourite products of the week… Windle and Moodie hair masque This masque has made such a difference to the condition of my hair. It’s my new favourite intensive conditioner. You just massage a couple of tablespoon sized amounts through your hair, wrap in a towel and leave for 15 minutes and let the keratin and green tea and cocoa butter ingredients work their magic. This big 200ml pot is around £32 but this would last a couple of months if you treated your hair weekly. http://www.windleandmoodie.com/hairproducts/shop/ Body mists I have been keeping up with keep fit routine and have been another three times this week. I like to shower afterwards, and have been sampling various day fragrances and body mists post workout. These are the ones I am rating so far… Fresh Cream by Philosophy http://www.philosophyskincare.co.uk/fresh-cream-spray-fragrance.html This is an ultra light and fresh smelling perfume, although it’s so light I would call it more a body mist. It’s sweet, but not in any way sickly, and a great fragrance for layering with others. Great to spritz all over after moisturising. You can buy it from John Lewis or from various beauty websites for around £32 for 60ml and I love the elegant design of the bottle. Eau Ressourcante by Clarins http://www.clarins.co.uk/eau-ressourcante/0255610.html#start=1 This is a delightful fragrance which combines essential oils with plant extracts (basil iris and cedarwood) it’s not sweet, it leaves you feeling renewed and very fresh. This one lasts on your skin for a good while too. It’s around £33 and you get 100ml so it’s going to last a year in your gym bag. Energy Burst eau de parfum by Neom https://www.neomorganics.com/energy-burst-100-natural-eau-de-parfum.html This one has a real zing to it! If you like smelling citrus fresh this is the one for you – it’s all organic and it’s an eau de perfume so will last on your skin forever. It’s full of lemon, grapefruit, rosemary and basil. It’s the most pricey at £49 for 100ml but you only need two sprays and you are smelling great for the rest of the day. I have my new Lipsy collection out this week! It was shot last year out in super glam Hollywood. It’s very girly, perfect for Spring, lots of pastels, ruffles, soft lace and florals. You will be able to check out my new collection here: https://www.lipsy.co.uk/ I have been skiing with a group of our friends over the weekend, we have had a ball! I’m pleased to report I did so much better on the slopes than on my previous trip. Thanks again to my instructors at The Snow Centre in Hemel Hempstead. www.thesnowcentre.com for more info… It was only a short trip though as I need to be back for an important dress fitting – because I am off to The Brits on Wednesday night! Woo hoo! So excited for this, The Brits are always a fantastic night! Will tell you all about my skiing trip in the next blog… Until next week,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:39:27.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
