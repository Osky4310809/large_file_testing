These Rangoon co-stars have famously not gotten along during the film’s shoot and during their promotional rounds too, there have been a lot of comment-wars between the both of them. \nLooks like Shahid has decided to end their war when he was asked to comment on something Kangana said about him: \nI would not like to play a table tennis match on this whole episode by answering to each of her comments. I just wish to put an end to this match. Kangana should move ahead with all her co-stars in an amicable manner and work with a team spirit. \nThere you have it!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:54:29.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
