This is for the people who serve our country.\" Watch it for yourself here: An emotional Jim Leyland after Team USA's #WBC2017 win. pic.twitter.com/uwctU30m3r \n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) March 23, 2017 \nLeyland is known to get emotional after big victories, as we can recall from his time with the Tigers, and this one was no different. Team USA crushed Puerto Rico in the championship game 8-0, which was played in Los Angeles this year. This was the first title win for team USA since the international baseball tournament began in 2006, and the second time they advanced to the semi-finals or further. The tournament was originally held every three years, but in 2009, changed to occurring every four years. The next tournament will be held in 2021. \nAfter the huge win, Leyland briefly appeared on camera to say his quick sentiment with teary eyes. After, however, he promptly turned around and proceeded to join Team USA in the celebrations. You earned it, Jim.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:01:34.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
