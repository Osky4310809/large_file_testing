Last we heard from the ultra-elusive artist, she was premiering the surreal dance-film Soundtrack 7 , which was accompanied by a drastic overhaul of her website into a user-friendly archive of her complete creative output. Now, twigs has revealed that she is the creative director of NikeWomen’s Spring Zonal Strength Tights campaign through a frenetic dance film. Watch it above. \nTitled “do you believe in more?,” the film sees twigs along with a dozen professional athletes decked out in items from the new campaign set to the bewitching electronic music that has made her a household name. There is also, of course, a lot of voguing. Speaking of the collaboration, twigs said that she saw it as a means “to inspire people who want to use their bodies in a positive way…in order to push people to be healthy and understand that, through any genre of sport, they can be the best versions of themselves.” \nFKA twigs has kept herself busy with projects this past year, including the aforementioned Soundtrack 7 , and the single “Good to Love.” Her last musical release was the EP M3LL155X in 2015, so it seems likely that a full-length may be headed our way soon. Stay tuned for more information regarding the new NikeWomen campaign. \nWatch the music video for “Good to Love” below.\n\nIn other music news, Beyoncé put on her journalistic glasses for a chat with her sister Solange just published in the new issue of Interview magazine.
