McClatchy High School Ryan Lillis Protestors approach C.K. McClatchy High School Friday Ryan Lillis 1 of 3 i \nBy Ryan Lillis \nAbout 500 people protesting the inauguration of Donald Trump as president converged on the state Capitol Friday after marching along various routes through Sacramento. \nThe march was largely peaceful, with police controlling traffic. Disability rights activist and former Sacramento mayoral candidate Russell Rawlings was among the speakers. He noted that Sacramento is a Sanctuary City, and that Trump has threatened to strip such cities of federal support. \n“We’re going to have a lot of work ahead of us,” he said. “We need to build the resistance now.” \nFour groups of marchers came together at the Capitol after starting from points in Oak Park, Land Park, West Sacramento and north Sacramento. \nOne group, numbering about 100 people, started marching at Sacramento City College. About 1 p.m. Friday, they passed C.K. McClatchy High School with chants of “Join us, Join us.” \nAbout two dozen students walked out of the school and joined the march toward the Capitol. \nSchool district officials said there have been no reports of students leaving the McClatchy High School campus. “The population has been stable during the day,” said Maria Lopez, Sacramento City Unified spokeswoman. \nBut McClatchy teacher Lori Jablonski said that about 25 students joined the protesters. \n“We ran to the windows when we heard the rally folks come by,” she said. “Most of my students had no idea this was happening.” \nStudents also joined the march from Sacramento Charter High School in Oak Park. \nMarchers held signs declaring “Not my President,’ and Stand up, fight back.” \nTraffic was backed up on Freeport, a major thoroughfare, as marchers paraded down the middle of the street. Two motorcycle officers rode in front of them and several patrol cars followed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:37:02.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
