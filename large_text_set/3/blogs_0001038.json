Lafayette on the 13th floor that was roomy and listing for $175,000. Also, with all these, we should mention the HOA fees, which for that unit are $1,673 a month. That listing had 13th floor views and space going for it. A new co-op is listing for about the same price ($174,900) and lower HOA fees ($1,269 a month). It’s on the third floor and coming in at 1,210 square feet, but has recently been remodeled for a pretty sleek look. The living space overlooks downtown (you can see the Ren Center quite clearly, and the listing smartly included evening pictures) and the River. You can also get a good view of DuCharme Place, which will be open soon. The kitchen has quartz counter tops and an island for seating. The renovated bathrooms also have quartz counter tops and lovely tiling in the showers. The co-op has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. As always, the location is close to downtown, the Riverfront, and Eastern Market. It’s listed through Jason Hill at Historic Realty Detroit .
