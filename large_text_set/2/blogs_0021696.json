In the brand's current TV ads, fashionable young people are surprised to find a Buick that doesn't look like a stodgy old dad wagon. \nThere's no need to make that case with drivers in China, where Buick , outsells Honda, Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. \nIn the U.S., Buick sold 202,000 cars last year. In China, it closed out a record-breaking year, delivering more than 1.1 million vehicles -- that's about 80% of the brand's worldwide sales. SUVs accounted for a big part of that success. China's first premier Zhou Enlai kept a Buick at his house in Shanghai. \nBuick's popularity on the mainland is linked to China's last emperor and other historical leaders. \nSun Yat Sen, often referred to as the founding father of modern China, had one. And the two owned by Emperor Pu Yi reportedly became the first cars ever to enter the Forbidden City in Beijing. \nUnlike the emperor, Buick hasn't been branded as a relic of the past. \nIt was one of the first brands that GM's Chinese joint venture launched back in the late 1990s, says Ka Leong Lo, an auto analyst at Maybank. The automaker used Buick's upscale reputation to target China's growing middle and upper-middle class. \nLo attributes Buick's success in China to a couple of factors: \"First is heritage, second is they have the right products.\" \nIn China, that means SUVs. \nBuick has two extremely popular ones in China -- the Excelle and the Envision -- that sell more than 30,000 units a month. With the Envision SUV, Buick quietly became the first big automaker to sell Chinese-built SUVs in the U.S. \nThey have been so successful that Buick began building SUVs in China -- not only for customers there but also for overseas markets. \nBut the company could run into obstacles under President Trump, who has threatened to take a tough line on trade with China. \nAround the same time that Trump was on the campaign trail slamming Ford's decision to manufacture cars in Mexico, Buick quietly became the first big automaker to start selling a Chinese-built SUV, the Envision, in the U.S. \nSomehow, Trump missed that . Since his election victory, he has threatened GM ( GM ) , Toyota ( TM ) and other car companies over their plans to make cars in Mexico. But he hasn't so far singled out Buick's China production of the Envision. \nThe brand could yet run into political issues over SUVs made in China sold to American drivers, according to Lo. \nBuick, though, is playing down the significance of the work done in China. \n\"Envision was designed globally, with GM's global resources,\" Liu-Barnocki said. \"The hardcore work in terms of design and engineering, that product development ... much of that was conducted in the U.S.\" CNNMoney (Hong Kong) First published February 22, 2017: 11:51 PM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:27:53.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
