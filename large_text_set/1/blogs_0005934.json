He has stolen our hearts with his music, and we just can't express our ever-lasting love for the songs from films such as Dil Se and Bombay. Recently he had us floored when he performed Vande Mataram with Chris Martin, at the Global Citizen Festival. On his 49th birthday, we give you seven interesting facts about the music maestro. \n1. We think his first film was R oja , but that's not true. It was a Malayalam film, Yodha. \n2. Rahman wanted to become a computer engineer while growing up. \n3. It is common knowledge that A R Rahman converted to Islam, but most of us don't know that his birth name was Dilip Kumar. Also, coincidentally his wife's name is Saira Banu. \n4. Rahman shares his birthday with his son, Ameen, who was also born on January 6. \n5. The music composer's Oscar-winning song Jai Ho , from the film Slumdog Millionaire , was initially composed for the Salman Khan starrer, Yuvraaj . However, the song was not included in the film's soundtrack. \n6. He was apparently suspended from school, at the age of fifteen, due to his inconsistent attendance record. \n7. He doesn't like to party, nor does he go to theatre. He likes to a lead a quiet life away from the limelight. When he gets free time he just spends it with his family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:12:29.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
