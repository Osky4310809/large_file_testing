I also advise on music related properties, band strategy, record deals and other industry related fields.\" \nJimmy added: \"In addition to having run a technology company for four years, I have 30+ years of experience in the entertainment industry. This gives me a unique and holistic understanding of the music business. \n\"I witnessed drastic change in both of these markets which gives me a valuable vantage point. I forged thousands of relationships and friendships over the years, which allows me to tap into the collective wisdom of the industry, stay current with trends, and see developments in real time.\" \nAsked to single out the best advice he was ever given, the drummer noted: \"When I was leaving the Pumpkins back in 2009 I had some fear about money and such, and a good friend and mentor told me, 'I remember sitting on the couch talking to my Dad. I don't remember what the couch looked like.' Point being that you can always make money, but you don't get time with your loved ones back.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T06:39:50.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
