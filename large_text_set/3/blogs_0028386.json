On RT, the American author of 11 books, and social critic, who is also a Presbyterian minister with a master’s degree from Harvard Divinity School, is “On Contact” with the black sheep of the establishment. \n\" Now we have news as just one of the innumerable revenue streams for Viacom or General Electric or Rupert Murdoch News Corp competing against revenue streams, and this has created a kind of vacuum. I think the last show on national television, on PBS that dealt with power was Bill Moyers – that's gone now. And that's fatal to a democracy ,\" Hedges told RT. \n\" We need programs where dissident voices that challenge the dominant narrative, that critique systems of power, including of course corporate power, can be heard. And there is almost no space left, and that's what we've tried to do with 'On Contact,' to fill that void ,\" he added. \nActivists, intellectuals, revolutionaries, and radicals are the journalist’s conversation partners on the show, often exposing the assault on democratic systems, the ecosystem, and the greed of big corporations. \nThe RT America host previously spent 20 years (15 of them with the New York Times ) reporting from Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and the Balkans. He has been an outspoken critic of the Iraq War and criticized the media coverage at the time of the military campaign as “ shameful cheerleading .” \nIn 2002, Hedges won the Pulitzer Prize with a team of reporters for his coverage of global terrorism. \nThe 44th Daytime Emmy awards ceremony will take place in Pasadena, California on April 30. Meanwhile, you can watch Chris Hedges ‘On Contact’ every Saturday on RT America, at 4pm EST, with repeats at 6:30pm and 10:30pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:39:52.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
