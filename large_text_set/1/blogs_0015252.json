One of the films that will premiere in this section is the new thriller “ Killing Ground ,” about a young couple’s nightmarish weekend getaway. When Ian (Ian Meadows) and Sam (Harriet Dyer) arrive at an isolated campsite, they figured they would escape urban living for a while, but instead, they find an abandoned SUV and a tent. As night falls and the other campers don’t return, Ian and Sam grow increasingly uneasy, only to discover a distressed toddler wandering alone on the campground. The film also co-stars Aaron Pedersen (“Water Rats”) and Aaron Glenane (“Truth”). Watch an exclusive trailer for the film below. \nREAD MORE: 10 Surprises and Hidden Gems from the 2017 Sundance Lineup \nThe film is written and directed by Damien Power.
