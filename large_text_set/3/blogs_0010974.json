I've always loved those guys - brothers Joe and Dennis [it's Mario but oh well] are just an incredible team and it's just great musicianship, great songs. \n\"The new album is a real departure from the last one, it almost sounds psychedelic at times, and I'm pretty psyched about it. That's pretty much all I've been listening to for the past months.\" Nonne \n\"I've been listening to this other really weird band that I've discovered from England, they're called Nonne. It's two guys and it sounds kinda like '60s R&B, but there's elements of trip-hop in it. There's keyboards and synths, and when he sings he sounds like an African-American guy. \n\"It's just really cool laid-back music that is good to listen to when I've surfed or something. I listen to Gojira on my way to surf to get me all fired up, and then I listen to Nonne after I surfed.\" The only artist named Nonne that pops up on the web is this hip-hop producer and MC from Sydney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:41:57.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
