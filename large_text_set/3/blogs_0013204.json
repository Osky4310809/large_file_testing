I saw the ball and went for it. I reacted quickly and everything went well for me.” Atletico's Antoine Griezmann. Source: AP \nLeverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno also played well to keep Atletico from capitalizing on its chances. \nLeverkusen was trying to reach the quarterfinals for the first time since it lost to Real Madrid in the 2002 final. The German club was eliminated by Atletico at this same stage in a penalty shootout two seasons ago, when Oblak also thrived with an important penalty save. Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak makes a save. Source: AP \nThe goalkeeper made amazing back-to-back saves on Wednesday after a mistake by Atletico defender Jose Gimenez led to a dangerous breakaway for Leverkusen in the 68th minute. \nOblak first stopped Julian Brandt’s attempt in a one-on-one, then immediately threw himself in front of the goal to keep Kevin Volland from scoring from the rebound, and again outstretched his arms to block Volland’s other attempt from close range. \nThe German club still had another chance in the same move, but the shot by Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez missed wide of the far post as Oblak watched. Oblak later made two other key stops to keep out dangerous shots by Leon Bailey and Kevin Kampl. Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno was also immense. Source: AP \nLeno had prevented Atletico from scoring with a superb fingertip save after a close-range shot by Angel Correa in the 38th, and again with a great stop to a low shot by Koke two minutes later. \nAtletico is trying to return to the final after losing to Real Madrid last season. Diego Simeone’s team also lost to the city rival in the Champions League final in 2014. \nIn the night’s other second-leg match, Monaco beat Manchester City 3-1 at home to advance on the away goals rule after their contest finished 6-6 on aggregate. The draw for the quarterfinals will be held on Friday. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
