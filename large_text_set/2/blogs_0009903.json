Performing at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, Katy showed off her new song , co-written by Sia, at the awards while wearing a ’70s inspired tuxedo, which of course, she rocked. The 13-time Grammy nominated artist ended the performance of her new song alongside Skip Marley, Bob Marley’s son, hand-in-hand with “We the People” (you know, the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution) emblazoned across the screen.\nYAS KATY!\nKevin Winter/Getty We have to applaud Perry for taking the time to make a statement about unity amidst this turbulent political climate. We love that she was seen hand-in-hand with the son of an icon who stood for peace, and we especially love that Perry did all of this while the world watched.\nLarry Busacca/Getty And we love that no mater what, Perry remembers not to take herself too seriously. Of course, she stands her own when she literally takes a stand, but she is still Katy Perry.\nLet’s also call attention to the “persist” band on her arm, possibly in reference to Elizabeth Warren’s now infamous “Nevertheless, she persisted” moment recently.\nJohn Shearer/WireImage : Kevin Winter/Getty \nAnd of course she looks effortlessly cool in her all-white ensemble and sneakers.\nWatch Katy’s performance here:\nKaty Perry's performance of Chained to the rhythm.
