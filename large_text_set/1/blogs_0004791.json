They’re preparing for it as well.” \nBecause no snow emergency has been declared, Walsh reminded residents that using space savers is not permitted. Any items left in the street will be collected. \nSaturday is trash day in Boston, and Walsh told WBZ-TV trucks have been out early in the morning to avoid having garbage covered by the incoming snow. \nWalsh asked residents to help their neighbors during the storm, and encouraged people to clear out fire hydrants. \nHe also issued a reminder not to throw snow back into the street, and asked commercial property owners not to plow snow into the road. \n“If we can all work together to remove the snow rather than push it around, we’ll be in good shape for Monday morning,” Walsh said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T12:17:56.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
