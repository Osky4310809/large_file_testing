That you weren’t appropriate? That you were pornography? That displaying your nipples (or her nipples) was somehow disturbing, or so likely to create a disturbance that, like yelling “fire” in a crowded theater, there had to be rules against it? \nThe creators of the body-positive and go-girl underwear brand Oddo Body do. In late December, to celebrate the incoming year, the company posted an image to its account—the bodybuilder and dragon slayer Lisa Lyon, nude, flexing her muscles, and unleashing her curves to the lens of Robert Mapplethorpe—only to be forced to remove it by the social media giant. \nThis is not a new story. This is not the first piece of art or image of nature that Instagram has censored, and it will likely not be the last: #FreeTheNipple , yadda yadda yadda; this is well-tilled earth. The fact that it was a Mapplethorpe image is almost humorous, and echoes older cases of art censorship: Mapplethorpe’s stark imagery of naked people, S&M, and gay sex acts famously elicited charges of obscenity against some who displayed them . Instagram’s move was almost a little too on-the-nose—a hat on a hat, or a fist in a fist, as the case may be. \nThere are sure to be mixed feelings about a for-profit company using the work of Mr. Mapplethorpe for its own gain, but let’s put its use of the photographer’s estate aside for a second, and focus on what was taken from Oddo Body’s female proprietors (and from women everywhere, on a regular basis) when they were told to cover up or consider themselves cut off. It is understandable that Instagram needs to draw lines in what its platform will show if it wants to retain its age-12+ rating. But in staking out its position—“ Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK ”—it’s entered an art-vs.-pornography debate as security guard, a position that time and time again has been on the wrong side of history. And yet this month presents a unique opportunity to not only reverse course on a policy that falls somewhere between Orwellian and Kafka-esque, but to stand with all its female users, and every woman in the world. \nHere’s the proposal: On January 20, 2017, for a single day, Instagram should allow female nipples to appear on its platform. \nIdeally, this policy would continue forever and would apply to the entire female form, but on the day when a president who has publicly degraded and boasted about grabbing women wants all eyes on him, Instagram should give us all somewhere else to look. \nA man pleading for the right to see more breasts, under the guise of feminism, is a little closer to National Lampoon than Ms. Magazine than I’d like, but that isn’t the reason I make the ask. It would be a statement. It would be a statement of support for women that will resound louder than any performer who takes the stage when Mr. Trump takes his oath. That oath, that day, that man, would be upstaged by a digital parade of femininity, strength, and self-expression so daring, so engaging, that any of us would be a fool to miss it. \nAnd so, a not-so modest proposal for Instagram, on January 20: Please #FreeTheNippleOneDay. \nIt’s the right thing to do. Also, it’s just good business! Not sure if you’ve noticed, people like the female form. People of all stripes! Including us. And them.
