Still, there is everyday life to deal with and problems happen in the lives of everyone. On Tuesday afternoon, Vince McMahon was out driving in his Bentley not far from WWE headquarters in Connecticut and ended up getting into a pretty serious car accident. \nTMZ Sports was one of the first to report of the accident and it actually ended up happening less than a mile from WWE’s main offices in Stamford, Connecticut. Being who he is, it was not unlikely for something like this to happen in public and pictures of it stay clear of social media. \nIt appears as if McMahon’s Bentley ended up being pretty torn up in the crash and the WWE boss can even be seen walking around at the scene of the accident. \nVince McMahon moments after he crashed his Bentley earlier today.

No injuries have been reported from any vehicles involved in the accident and that all involved appeared to be “okay” after it happened. \nBoth McMahon’s Bentley and the other driver’s Toyota appeared to have sustained a great deal of damage in the accident. Judging from the pictures, it is actually quite amazing that no-one was hurt, but that is also a very good thing. \nAs soon as word of the minor car accident started making the social media rounds, everyone first waited to make sure Vince McMahon and all were not injured. From that point, the jokes and laughter started appearing in reference an absurd WWE storyline from years ago. [Image by WWE] \nBack in the summer of 2007, WWE held a “Mr. McMahon Appreciation Night” on Monday Night Raw due to everyone trying to cheer him up after his “nervous breakdown.” It didn’t go quite like they planned and McMahon left the arena in an even more depressed mood than when he arrived. \nAs he left, McMahon paused as he went to enter his limo and gave a bit of an evil look around before closing the door. Upon closing the door, the limo exploded in a giant fireball and the episode of Raw ended with Vince McMahon seemingly “dead.” \nWWE really played it up for weeks as if he was truly dead and it was just a very strange and weird storyline and time in the company. The storyline came to a screeching halt after Chris Benoit’s suicide and the death of his wife and son. \n“Vince McMahon involved in car accident today” pic.twitter.com/srRo8ZWIFY \n— risa (@minygrande) March 21, 2017 \nMcMahon’s fake death was brought to light in early August and he returned to say the limo explosion took place to see what people really thought about him. It really hasn’t been mentioned much over the years, but his accident today has it becoming a focus point once again. \nThe good thing is that no-one ended up being injured in the car accident and McMahon is scheduled to be at SmackDown tonight at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut. \nWrestleMania 33 is pretty much the entire focus of Vince McMahon and all of WWE right now, and one wouldn’t be surprised to see them all exhausted. While it could be that McMahon’s mind was elsewhere, there is also the possibility that his car accident today in Connecticut was nothing more than that. The good thing is that no-one appeared to be hurt and that all can likely just move on from the incident. \n[Featured Image by WWE]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:51:11.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
