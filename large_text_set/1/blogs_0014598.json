While the reasons for the meeting are unclear, the BBC's Umaru Fofana in Banjul says that parliament may be asked to extend Mr Jammeh's term of office. Profile: Yahya Jammeh \nThe Gambia, a tiny country of less than two million people, is surrounded on three sides by Senegal and regional bloc Ecowas has said it is considering military intervention to force Mr Jammeh to relinquish power. \nOne woman boarding the boat with her three children told our correspondent that the political uncertainty made it hard to ensure she could look after her children. \n\"We don't know what to expect with electricity outage, water shortage, food supplies,\" she said. \nAnother said she was going \"because things are not safe\". \n\"I'm going because I am afraid. I'm going until we have peace and then we can come back.\" \nThe UN refugee agency said last week that several thousand people, mainly children, have crossed into Senegal from The Gambia since 3 January. \n\"UNHCR teams report seeing buses filled with children, accompanied by women, cross the border,\" said Liz Ahua, the regional representative for UNHCR. \nMr Jammeh's attempt to overturn the election result has been delayed because of a shortage of judges. \nThe African Union has said it will no longer recognise Mr Jammeh's authority after his term ends. \nThe 51-year-old leader seized power in the country in 1994 and has been accused of human rights abuses, although he has held regular elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T15:22:31.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
