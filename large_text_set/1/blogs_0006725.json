Could   \nIsrael's ambassador to Britain has apologised after secret footage showed an embassy official discussing \"idiot\" Boris Johnson and how to \"take down\" his deputy. \nShai Masot, a political officer at the Israeli embassy, was caught making the extraordinary claim about Sir Alan Duncan for causing \"a lot of problems\" during dinner in a swanky restaurant. \nSir Alan has been critical of Israel and in 2014 described settlements as \"illegal\", adding they were \"theft, annexation, a land grab\". \nQatari government-owned news network Al Jazeera secretly filmed Mr Masot in October with Maria Strizzolo, an aide to Tory education minister Robert Halfon - the former political director of Conservative Friends of Israel. Read More \nDining across the street from the Israeli embassy in Kensington, West London, Mr Masot is seen asking: \"Can I give you some names of MPs that I would suggest you take down?\" The comments referred to Boris Johnson's Foreign Office deputy Sir Alan Duncan (Photo: PA) \nMs Strizzolo apparently replied that all MPs have \"something they're trying to hide\". \nMr Masot responded by saying \"I have some MPs\", adding \"she knows which MPs I want to take down\", before specifying \"the deputy foreign minister\". \nHe continued by dismissing Sir Alan's boss Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, as an \"idiot\". \nThe footage showed him saying: \"He's basically good. He just doesn't care. He's busy with everything else \n\"He is an idiot but so far he has become the minister of foreign affairs without any responsibilities, so technically if something real happened it won't be his fault.\" \nIn a statement the Israeli Embassy said it \"rejects the remarks concerning Minister Duncan, which are completely unacceptable\". \nThe spokesman added: \"The comments were made by a junior embassy employee who is not an Israeli diplomat, and who will be ending his term of employment with the embassy shortly. Protesters clash with an Israeli soldier over settlements, which Sir Alan has criticised (Photo: Rex) \n\"Ambassador Regev on Friday spoke with Minister Duncan, apologised for the comments and made clear that the embassy considered the remarks to be completely unacceptable.\" \nTory chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Crispin Blunt, who was also referred to by Mr Masot, said the comments about Sir Alan were \"outrageous\". \nBut Ms Strizzolo told the Mail on Sunday and Observer that her conversation with Mr Masot was \"light, tongue-in-cheek and gossipy\". \nShe told the papers: \"The implications [you are] seeking to draw from a few out-of-context snippets of a conversation, obtained by subterfuge, over a social dinner are absurd. \n\"Any suggestion that I, as a civil servant working in education, could exert the type of influence you are suggesting is risible.\" \nShe said she knew Mr Masot \"purely socially and as a friend. He is not someone with whom I have ever worked or had any political dealings beyond chatting about politics, as millions of people do, in a social context\". \nThe conversation was recorded by an undercover reporter who dined with the pair. \nThe reporter - known as Robin - posed as a graduate activist with strong sympathies towards Israel who was keen to help combat the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement prominent in Britain. \nA Foreign Office spokesman said: \"The Israeli Ambassador has apologised and is clear these comments do not reflect the views of the Embassy or Government of Israel. The UK has a strong relationship with Israel and we consider the matter closed.\" \nIt comes after Theresa May issued a thinly-veiled rebuke to US Secretary of State John Kerry - one of Britain's key allies - over his war of words with Israel.
