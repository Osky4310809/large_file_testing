The pert hot hatch has been given a new look and a little bit of extra grunt, but has seen a slight reduction of kit compared to its rather well-specced predecessor . \nFirst up, the price – RM143,888 on-the-road with insurance, RM4,000 more expensive than before. Included is the new five-year/120,000 km warranty that replaces the previous three-year manufacturer/two-year insurance coverage. \nEnthusiasts will want to know what’s changed under the bonnet, so let’s get down to business. The Prince 1.6 litre Turbo High Pressure (THP) four-cylinder engine has been retained, but has been fettled to produce 208 hp (hah!) at 6,000 rpm and 300 Nm at 3,000 rpm, the same figures as on the hardcore 30th Anniversary Edition (now called the 208 GTi by Peugeot Sport). \nThose numbers are up eight horsepower and 25 Nm over the outgoing model, but at significantly higher revs. As such, the new car zips from zero to 100 km/h three tenths of a second faster at 6.5 seconds, although the top speed remains at 230 km/h. A six-speed manual gearbox remains the sole transmission option. \nThe upgrades have also made the engine Euro 6 compliant, and with the addition of automatic engine stop/start, more economical. Combined fuel consumption has dropped from 5.9 litres per 100 km to 5.4 litres per 100 km, while carbon dioxide emissions now sit at just 125 grams per kilometre. \nDifferentiating the new from old is a revised front fascia featuring a new integrated grille – the U-shaped red trim at the bottom of the grille on the outgoing model has been replaced by a simple red stripe. There are also new LED tail lights with triple “lion claw” light guides, while the GTi-specific headlights (with C-shaped LED indicators) and 17-inch “Carbone” two-tone alloy wheels remain unchanged. \nInside, the rather tacky gradated red decorative trim has been replaced by piano black items, with the door handles gaining the same red stripe as on the 30th Anniversary Edition. In terms of kit, the facelifted model loses out on the panoramic glass roof, Park Assist and front parking sensors. \nOtherwise, standard equipment is the same as before and includes Club Nappa leather/Caro Weave fabric combination bucket seats, automatic headlights and wipers, dual-zone automatic climate control, a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system, Bluetooth connectivity and six speakers. Safety-wise, the 208 GTi gets six airbags, ABS with EBD and brake assist, stability control and ISOFIX rear child seat anchors. \nWant to know how the Peugeot 208 GTi drives?
