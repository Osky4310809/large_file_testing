Directed by Sunhil Sippy, the film is based on Pakistani author Saba Imtiaz’s novel, Karachi, You’re Killing Me! and follows a Pakistani journalist-writer Noor’s misadventures and love life as she navigates her way through Mumbai. Sonakshi Sinha has revealed that the her role of a journalist in the film is just like any other girl as she is a “bundle of contradictions.” The film stars Sonakshi Sinha, Kanan Gill, Shibani Dandekar and Purab Kohli. Sunny Leone also has a cameo in the film. The music of the film is composed by Amaal Malik and Sonakshi Sinha will be seen crooning the title track. \nThe first thing that catches your attention in the trailer is its slice-of-life feel. It will instantly remind you of Alia Bhatt’s Dear Zindagi, which is a good thing. The trailer shows Sonakshi Sinha’s character, who is a journalist, not being happy with her life. She is single, has a group of friends she hangs out with, a job where she is forced to interview Sunny Leone when she clearly wants to cover some serious issues, a date whom she likes. So far so good, but the film suddenly takes a U-turn and becomes an investigative one. Giving you the feel of No One Killed Jessica.

I liked the initial bit of it but was left disappointed when suddenly it changed to an investigative story. \nAlso the revisited version of Gulabi Aankhein is played in the background. What’s with Bollywood revisiting the classics. Is there a dearth of music composers who can create an original tune? That’s food for thought… \nLet us know what you think of the trailer in the comments below.
