Leicester City Lineups and Stats \nUntil goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel boldly became the first to break ranks on Friday by posting a message of \"thanks and respect\" for Ranieri on Instagram, not a single one of the club's players had uttered a word on the manager's sacking. \nThen, on Saturday, in an almost-orchestrated fashion, the \"tributes\" began to emerge on social media. Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, Danny Drinkwater and captain Wes Morgan led the way, all crediting Ranieri with creating the belief and faith which enabled them to enjoy the most incredible season of their career. \nIt all felt a little contrived and somewhat forced. But then nothing has seemed quite right at Leicester City all season. \nNobody expected the Foxes to retain the Premier League title, and that sense of reality was shared by Ranieri and the club's owners, but equally, nobody would have imagined they would face Liverpool in the final week of February sitting in the bottom three either. \nStill, while Ranieri remained at the helm, it was easy for the finger of blame to be pointed at him. The 65-year-old had, apparently, tinkered too often with personnel and tactics and altered the training schedules which had proved so successful last season. \nWith Leicester starting 2017 without scoring a goal in the Premier League -- they still haven't managed one since the 1-0 home win against West Ham on Dec. 31 -- Ranieri was the obvious scapegoat and, by losing his job, he has taken the ultimate hit. \nYet with Ranieri no longer there to shield his players and staff from the scrutiny that the team's position has warranted, they are now exposed and facing up to the fact that, if it continues to go wrong and Leicester end up relegated, they will have nobody to blame but themselves. Quite simply, the players now have to step up. \nVardy needs to rediscover the goal scoring touch - and perhaps his goal in Seville might be a crucial turning point -- while Mahrez must become the mercurial talisman of last season again. \nMorgan and Robert Huth must learn how to defend resolutely again; Drinkwater needs to take command of the midfield; Craig Shakespeare, promoted to caretaker-manager from his role as Ranieri's assistant, must find a way of fixing a broken machine without indulging those players who have left Leicester fighting for survival. Relive Claudio Ranieri's best moments during his unforgettable season that saw Leicester City crowned league champions. \nLeicester's players have no more excuses, which is why the dynamic of their dressing room before the Liverpool game will be intriguing. If Ranieri had become unpopular among the players, as reports suggested he had, then they can no longer sulk about his decisions and management style. \nThey are the ones in the firing line, but if they suddenly turn back the clock and secure a convincing win against Jurgen Klopp's team, they will be accused to downing tools under Ranieri and picking their moment to perform. Player-power (the so-called phenomenon of players deciding their manager isn't up to it and doing their best to drive him out of the club) is an overused term; the true power at any club is held by the owner. But if a group of players are no longer convinced by their manager, it shows out on the pitch. \nDavid Moyes and Louis van Gaal were victims of this during their ill-fated reigns as Manchester United manager, while Brendan Rodgers also suffered as a consequence of it in the final weeks of his spell as Liverpool manager. The same applied to Jose Mourinho at Chelsea last season and many would argue that Arsene Wenger is battling to convince some of his Arsenal players that his way is the right way. \nLeicester's players have been performing like they had lost faith in Ranieri -- their results certainly support that theory -- but the ball is now firmly in their court. They have 13 Premier League games to not only save their season, but also their reputations, collectively and individually. Right now, they remain the players who achieved the most remarkable league title triumph in English football history. But if they are relegated to the Championship, they will have to suffer that ignominy for the rest of their lives. \nThey would forever be the players who won the title but threw it all away -- like a lottery winner who blew all the cash and ended up worse off than they began. It would be a bitter taste that would never go away, but they do, at least, still have time to make sure it does not happen. \nNow that Ranieri has gone, the only ones who can save Leicester are the players -- the same group who have put the club in the predicament they are currently in. \nMark Ogden is a senior football writer for ESPN FC.
