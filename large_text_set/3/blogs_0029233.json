This week's best SSD deals and hard drive deals 2.5-inch SSD deals \nKingDian 120GB SSD | Now £43.99 | Amazon \nWith 120GB SSD deals being a bit scarce of late, it's made more sense to look towards the larger 240GB Solid State Drives instead, especially as they've been the same price lately. KingDian range of cheap drives offers a modest saving over the 240GB deal below though. \nDrevo X1 Series 120GB SSD SATAIII SSD Solid State Drive | Now £41.99 | eBay \nWhile the Drevo brand doesn't carry as much weight as the likes of SanDisk or Toshiba, they're one of the cheapest options this week for a 120GB Solid State Drive. \nSanDisk 240GB Solid State Drive Plus | Now £76.99 | Amazon \nIf you know you're going to need some extra space for games or movies, we'd recommend this deal over the smaller SSDs. This is your best deal for a more recognised brand than cheaper deals we saw last week. \nWD Blue 1TB 2.5-inch Internal SSD | Now £264 | Amazon \nLike the idea of a 1TB SSD deal, but don't want to pay over £300? That sounds like a reasonable enough request and Amazon is one of the few sites complying (by some distance!) at £264. \nKingston 1TB SSDNow KC400 deals This new 2.5-inch SSD from Kingston is super fast and ideal for laptops or even a PS4. It's newness is keeping the price quite high though, with most retailers hovering around the £320 mark for early adopters. Keep an eye on this comparison chart below though for the latest prices and you'll hopefully find a better deal as time goes by. 3.5-inch PC hard drive deals \nToshiba P300 2TB 3.5-inch High-Performance Hard Drive | Now £59.99 | Amazon \nWith most retailers charging over £70, this cheap internal drive is well worth a look if you're wanting to upgrade the capacity on an older PC. \nToshiba P300 3TB 7200RPM 3.5-inch Hard Drive | Now £78.98 | Amazon \nThe price for this 3TB drive is impressive enough, but the increased 7200RPM speed is another big selling point too. \nSeagate ST4000DM000 4TB 3.5-inch Hard Drive | Now £112.99 | Novatech \nThis is one of the cheapest 4TB PC hard drives we've seen for a while and should provide enough space for most users. Most other drives of this size start at about £135. \nToshiba X300 5TB 3.5-inch Extreme-Performance Hard Drive | Now £144.99 | Amazon \nThis speedy 7200RPM hard drive is excellent value if you're looking for a large 5TB capacity. If you need something that big though, maybe we can tempt you with the 6TB drive below instead? \nToshiba X300 6TB 3.5-inch Hard Disk Drive 7200RPM | Now £174.99 | Amazon \nThis Toshiba drive isn't a massive leap in price over the 5TB option above. Still not enough space though? That's ok, we have some even larger hard drive deals below. \nSeagate IronWolf 10TB 3.5-inch hard drive deals This brand new hard drive from Seagate has just been released and our very own Matt Hanson gave it a highly recommended 4.5/5 rating in his extensive appraisal .

This is currently the very cheapest 1TB option in our internal hard drive deals guide. \nSeagate Backup Plus Slim 1TB USB 3.0 portable hard drive | Now £56.99 | Amazon \nThis stylish hard drive is available in multiple colours and is cheapest at Amazon today. \nTranscend 1TB Military-Grade Shock Resistance Portable Hard Drive | Now £56.60 | Amazon \nThis 1TB USB 3.0 external drive is usually a bit pricier than the offers posted above, but it's had a tenner knocked off this week! It's able to withstand clumsy drops or getting bashed about a bit. If you need something that's going to travel with you a lot, this is certainly one to consider. \nMaxtor M3 2TB USB 3.0 Slimline Portable Hard Drive | Now £69.52 | Amazon \nWe haven't had a decent 2TB deal in while as the prices have been way too close to the 1TB or 3TB options. At this price though, this 2TB hard drive deal sits nicely between the other sizes. \nSeagate Expansion 4TB Desktop USB 3.0 external hard drive | Now £111.15 | Amazon \nThis Seagate offer from Maplin is your next best option for a 4TB external hard drive, especially as Argos' offer for a similar drive last week has shot up by £10. This really should be plenty of space unless you're storing a lot of media files. \nSeagate Expansion 5TB USB 3.0 external Hard Drive | Now £129.99 | Amazon \nIf the Toshiba deal above doesn't do it for you, you could opt for this Seagate drive, so maybe hang on for a discount.
