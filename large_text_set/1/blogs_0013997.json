The two-step system promises up to 14 days of wear , for half the price of a salon gel manicure. The colors go for $11.50 a bottle, and for two weeks of wear, you’ll be able to put the money you save on the salon toward ballet classes! \n\nThe colors are: Satin Slipper (a champagne ivory), Lace Me Up (a rose pink), Hold the Position (a coral peach pink), At the Barre (a cinnamon nude), Perfect Posture (a periwinkle powder blue), and Closing Night (a soft shimmer gray.)\nEssie is the prima ballerina of naming polishes! Those sassy subtle double entendres, those aspirational names (did anyone else sit up straight when they read “Perfect Posture”?) Don’t forget the top coat , it seals the deal with a gel-like finish and staying power. These polishes don’t need a base coat — how easy is this?\nSeriously, even the bottles look like ballerinas posing. gel couture’s six NEW lust-worthy shades will have you leaping for weeks with a long-lasting essie mani.
