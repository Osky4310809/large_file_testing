As Zenefits has had to shake off the perception of cutting corners in order to focus on growth, it’s had to temper back its plans and has instead started to focus on being more of a platform for HR managers to handle their employees and slot in third-party apps that access that data. \n“For us the most important thing is the core HR system, the employee system of record with the key workflows around employee hiring, like management and termination,” CEO David Sacks said. “That’s the thing that gives us the right to be a platform. Everyone wants to hook into that stuff. We see that as central. Payroll, we think, is a really important part, and of course benefits are important for revenue reasons. Everything thing else we see as something for a partner to do.” \nThe first new tool is a way for HR managers and employers to keep ahead of compliance requirements for their employees. For example, that might be flagging when an employee hasn’t submitted their required paperwork after accepting a job. This gives managers an overview of all the employees it needs to get in check in order to ensure that they are compliant with all regulations, Sacks said. And the challenge there, and what might give Zenefits a good pitch to companies, is that these regulations may whip from one requirement to another — requiring the service to be constantly appraised of how things are working. \nThe second is a documents-management application that gives HR managers a way to track all the documents that employees have to submit for their employers. The goal there isn’t to just offer file storage like a Box or a Dropbox. Zenefits’ documents app instead focuses on the metadata of those documents and tries to ensure that everything is signed and in a file somewhere. HR managers can upload documents on their own or request (or bug) employees to get their documents in on time.

Zenefits decided at the time that it would be better off trying to build an employee record database with all the attached requirements — such as payroll or document management — and let developers handle the rest. So far we’ve seen developers build tools that manage employee options and 401(k) plans so far, and more are on the way, Sacks said. He said the company has more than 50 companies in their developer pipeline.\nWhile Zenefits may seem at times to sort of be assembling some kind of mess of products — especially as new partners add new tools — they are all ones that HR managers need and have been requesting. The need for simplicity, however, isn’t lost on Sacks, and the company is trying to pare down the complexity of their pricing with a new model that charges per additional service. \n“When Zenefits launched originally, it had HR and made money off benefits,” Sacks said. ” In the past year we’ve been launching a bunch of different paid HR apps, and sharpening our focus on HR. We started rolling out more and more paid apps to have a price on every app becomes a little unwieldy. The bundles reflect the way that we expect Zenefits to actually be used.” \nAs Zenefits builds more and more tools and tries to simplify the model — making it more attractive for small business — Sacks said products like insurance for individuals (going to the bottom of the funnel) still weren’t something that interests the company. “On the insurance side, that’d be a detour for us,” he said. \nZenefits also said it was expanding payroll to five new states: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Colorado and Arizona. It already exists in California, Florida, Texas and Washington. That’s going to, naturally, bring the company in more direct competition with startups like Gusto (which is also gunning for HR) as well as larger providers like ADP. But Zenefits is hoping that as it becomes a more complete suite, it can become a more attractive platform for developers and eventually be more sophisticated. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T19:10:02.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
