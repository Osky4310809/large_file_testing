I’m almost always emailing while referring to a spreadsheet or PDF, web coding with a console and browser open, transfering files between windows, keeping multiple chat windows open, or even just messing around while keeping an eye on work. It’s obnoxious having to switch back and forth to see anything, and doubly so to keep manually dragging around windows to keep everything visible. On a 15” laptop screen, every pixel of real estate counts, and Magnet keeps everything perfectly (and quickly) laid out so I never have to mess around with my window layout. Snappy, easy to use, not overburdened with UI or useless features. Easily worth the price. My only wish would be to customize window positions/sizes, for apps where I could use more of a 60/40 ratio. Not a deal-breaker by any means, though. Very useful for college students by dltokidoki Before Magnet I would messily put my files, assignments, and have chrome laid out everywhere on my screen because I had this need to see everything opened. My boyfriend acknlowdged my disorganized habit and introduced me to Magnet and I must say this is the most convenient app I've ever purchased! I’m able to do a lot of assignments easily, for example I can use chrome on one half of the screen to read articles and on the other half I'll open up micorsoft word so I can look back into my article and write my essays without having to click back and forth. I also use the 3 split screen and would have chrome use my whole left half, then on the top right i would have my Reminders app opened and the bottom right I would have my calendar app opened.Overall this product is worth every penny, makes a difference, and is very efficient. First Review on App Store by Raybies0909 Hi All,I have been using Apple products for longer then I can remember. Parallel to that I have had a PC as a personal computer as I enjoy gaming from time-to-time. That said, I ALWAYS missed the functionality that Windows provides in regards to intuitively letting me view mutlipul things in a way that utilizies the screen revenue.This is better then Windows. It gives a bunch of different options of how you want the windows to be organized/sized and has become the most useful app to date that I have purchased. Honestly, if your time clicking/dragging for hours does not outway the $.99 they are asking for, then you really shouldn’t be browsing the app store, you should be looking for a new job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T20:31:42.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
