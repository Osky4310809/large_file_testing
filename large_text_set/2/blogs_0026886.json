Simpson was sentenced to serve 33 years in prison for armed robbery and kidnapping. Some nine years into his sentence he is up for parole due to good behavior. \nNow closing in on his 70th birthday, Simpson was sentenced to 33 years in Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada when he was found to have been involved in a 2007 armed robbery to retrieve items he claimed had been stolen from him by a retailer of sports memorabilia. \nOne tenet of Simpson's conviction was that he would not be eligible for parole for nine years.

The Brown and Goldman families have seen \"very little\" of the money owed to them as a result of the civil suit, according to the New York Post. A source close to the Goldmans said that \"[the families] have vowed to pursue him to the ends of the earth and will continue to do so after he walks out of prison. His nightmare might be coming to an end, but their's never will.\" ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:35:11.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
