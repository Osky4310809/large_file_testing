I am part of the Pan-African diaspora and I definitely feel like in America, even though race is a social construct and we've acknowledged this in academia and in science there still is a line drawn in the sides. There still are sides. Politically, there's a black side and a white side, and I stand unapologetically on the black side. I stand with my own internal sense of self and my own values. I stand with my sons, I stand with my sister, and I also stand really with the greater cause of challenging the myth of white supremacy.\"\nShe added:\n\"I really prefer to just be exactly who I am. And black is really the closest race and culture category descriptive term that represents the essential essence of who I am.\"\n!!!\nReally, what can we even say at this point? Her memoir will probably be a best-seller too! Our world is CRAY!\nWatch a short clip from the interview (below)!\n\"I don’t identify as African American, I identify as black,\" said Rachel Dolezal to @SavannahGuthrie . https://t.co/dOAtGn96My \n— TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 27, 2017 \nThe author also explained that she's changed her legal name to make it easier for her to find work. She admitted:\n\"I really felt like I needed to change my legal name in order to be seen for my qualifications and experience rather than just seen for the tabloid publicity that I got in 2015. When applying for a job, people were just seeing ‘Rachel Dolezal' and not paying attention to the wide ranging experience and qualifications that I do have.\"\nAs for the legacy of her book, the 39-year-old stated that she hopes readers are encouraged and inspired by her story:\n\"I really hope that readers are encouraged to be exactly who they are. Like I said, I want to tell the whole story of my life, and [I hope that] in some way [I'm] able to kind of set the record straight because my life story was really warped beyond recognition by a lot of the negative press in 2015.\"\nThe memoir is set to come out Tuesday, March 28.\n[ Image via Instagram . ] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:28:55.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
