The big city-set TV movie is inspired by the 1980s film “Adventures in Babysitting.” \n“We know these four young actresses all have the potential for extraordinary careers, and we’re excited to give them new opportunities to showcase their talents,” said Adam Bonnett, exec VP of original programming of Disney Channels Worldwide. “We’re especially proud of Rowan and Sabrina, as they have helped drive the success of our hit series ‘Girl Meets World.'” \n“Invisible Sister” was written by Jessica O’Toole and Amy Rardin (“Greek,”“The Carrie Diaries”), and Matt and Billy Eddy (“Teen Beach 2,”“Bad Hair Day”). It will be directed by Paul Hoen (“Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,”“How to Build a Better Boy”) and exec produced by Sheri Singer (“Halloweentown,”“Girl vs. Monster”). \n“Further Adventures in Babysitting” is written by Tiffany Paulsen (“Nancy Drew”), and will be directed by John Schultz (“Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer,”“Like Mike”) and exec produced by Michelle Manning (“Teen Beach 2,”“The Breakfast Club”). \nProduction on both TV movies is set to begin this spring, and the films are slated to premiere in fall 2015 or early 2016.
