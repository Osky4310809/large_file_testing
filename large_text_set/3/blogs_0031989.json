(Theodore Parisienne/for New York Daily News) Sunday, March 26, 2017, 10:41 PM \nFearless Girl isn’t going anywhere any time soon. \nThe statue, depicting a young ponytailed girl staring down the Financial District’s famous Charging Bull , will remain in place through February 2018, Mayor de Blasio's office told the Daily News on Sunday. \n“In her short time here, the Fearless Girl has fueled powerful conversations about women in leadership and inspired so many,” de Blasio said in a statement. “Now, she’ll be asserting herself and affirming her strength even after her temporary permit expires — a fitting path for a girl who refuses to quit.” \nThe extension comes after Public Advocate Letitia James pushed for the inspirational art to be made permanent — saying her message was necessary given the “huge gender gap” in the top ranks of American corporations and on corporate boards of publicly traded companies.

That office typically handles short-term events like block parties, festivals or promotions. \nTo allow Fearless Girl to continue standing firm on Department of Transportation property, the installation will get a longer- term permit through the DOT Art “Arterventions” program. \nThe statue hasn’t been without its critics — some have argued the feminist message would be stronger if it depicted a grown woman and others decried it as corporate feminism from a company that has just three women on its 11-member board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T06:04:04.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
