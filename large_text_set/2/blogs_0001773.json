From the outset, the “Plus” versions were both bigger and better than the non-plus versions, shipping with advanced features, often added to the camera, that attracted power users who want cutting edge technology. \nThis trend has continued with the iPhone 7 Plus, which features both a wide-angle lens and a 56mm telephoto lens that’ll support a variety of shooting conditions. The telephoto lens is compatible with a Portrait mode the produces a pleasing bokeh-effect that highlights the subject and blurs out the objects in the background. \nApple sold a record 78.3 million iPhones in the quarter even though it faced supply issues. Cook confirmed that the company underestimated demand issues leading to a shortage of handsets that impacted sales over the quarter. Like this post?
