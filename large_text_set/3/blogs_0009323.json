Forced to go on the run from a hostile government, the family joins up with an underground network of mutants and must fight to survive. \nWriter Matt Nix ( Burn Notice ) will executive produce and showrun the series. Director Bryan Singer ( X-Men: Apocalypse, X-Men: Days of Future Past ) will direct the pilot episode of the series. \n“Developing a Marvel property has been a top priority for the network–and we are so pleased with how Matt Nix has led us into this thrilling universe,” Fox Entertainment president David Madden said back in July when the show was announced. “There’s comic book adventure, emotional and complicated relationships, and a rich, existing mythology from which to draw. With the brilliant production crew behind this project, it has all the makings of a big, fun and exciting new series.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T17:17:46.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
