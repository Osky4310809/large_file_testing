The company is constantly working on the speed aspect as there are generally always some type of improvements to be made with the current system. Their goal is to make websites display at 60 frames per second and doing this means Chrome only has 16ms to render each frame. Chrome likes to break up pages into tiles so it only needs to redraw the tiles that are being changed.\nThis idea is being taken a step further with the latest changes as there are times when an entire tile doesn’t need to be redrawn. So while this is a lot better than redrawing the entire page, there’s definitely room for improvement here. Take the image below as an example. Tapping on the input field would generally cause the entire tile to be redrawn when that just isn’t necessary. Instead, the only part that needs to be redrawn is the blinking text cursor.\n\nSo instead of redrawing the entire tile, Chrome saves time and resources by simply redrawing the exact pixels that are needed. This helps to keep the 60 frames per second target for heavy websites and it improve the overall experience of Chrome for the end user. Google says this isn’t the only changes that have been made recently to help improve the overall speed of Chrome. Google’s web browser of choice is now better at figuring out how to complete its workload depending on the type of hardware that is available.\nVideos and canvases have been GPU accelerated since 2012, but there are other parts of a website that can benefit from utilizing the GPU. With Chrome on Android, macOS and Windows, you should see it uses your GPU more often to render websites that have complex layouts. This change helps to improve animation performance, input latency, and scroll smoothness for modern SVG and HTML5 pages.\nSource: Chromium Blog ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:06:05.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
