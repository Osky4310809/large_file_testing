The star announced her own denim line Good American and the collection is available online, and in select Nordstrom stores, for fans to shop. As promised, the brand offers three silhouettes: Good Legs (skinny), Good Cuts (boyfriend), and Good Waist (high-waisted) with prices ranging from $159 to $215. The denim's all produced in Los Angeles, a fact that Khloé was proud of and defended after a Twitter user accused her of operating a sweatshop. \nThe star also had another reason to be proud, though. Good American reached $1 million in sales on its first day of release. According to a press release, it was \"the biggest denim launch in apparel history.\" An even more impressive feat was the release of Good American's first non-denim item: a hoodie that immediately sold out. There is a waitlist, however, for those who want a second chance to snag one in navy. Khloé can probably rest easy now knowing fans are standing by her designs. \nGiven the success of the line, the star dropped a season two collection featuring two new jeans, denim skirts, and a jean jacket. The brand will roll out new products biweekly, so scroll on for a peek at what you can buy right now.
