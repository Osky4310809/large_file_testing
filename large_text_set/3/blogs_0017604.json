Spoiler: \nThe results came in and “Puss in Boots” beat “Ballerina” to progress to the next round. The person behind the ballerina mask was revealed to be CSJH The Grace’s Lina. \nLina greeted everyone and opened up about returning to TV for the first time in 10 years. She stated, “While I was away, I got married. I tied the knot in 2014, and I’ve moved on from the televised stage to singing and acting on the musical stage. But I wanted my voice to be heard beyond the musical stage, so I gathered up the courage and decided to come here.” \nShe continued to add, “I’ve never stood on stage by myself, even when I was a member of CSJH The Grace. I always thought my voice was not good enough to be heard on its own. I was always afraid and felt pressured by solo performances, and hearing such great feedback from the panel has given me a lot of confidence.” \nIt was great to see Lina on TV again for the first time in a while! \nCatch up with the latest episode of MBC’s “King of Masked Singer” below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T14:26:35.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
