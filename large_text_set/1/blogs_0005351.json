Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint \nMumbai: India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has reintroduced the controversial teaser loan offering on the first working day of 2017. \nA teaser home loan is a loan where the bank offers a lower fixed rate for the first few years of the loan term and then adjusts the loan rate to a higher floating rate on a pre-decided rate. This hybrid loan product allowed customers to protect themselves against a volatile interest rate scenario. \nIn a statement on Monday, SBI stated that customers would be able to avail home loans up to Rs30 lakh at a fixed rate of 8.55% for the first two years of the tenor of the loan, which would later be readjusted to a floating rate. For the bank’s women customers, the home loan rate has been fixed at 8.5% for the first two years. \nSBI had first introduced the teaser loan format in 2010 under then chairman O.P. Bhatt. The product was wildly popular owing to the volatility in interest rates during that period. This led to SBI’s home loan competitors like Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) and ICICI Bank Ltd introducing similar products. \nAlso read: Steep SBI rate cut sets stage for low-cost loans \nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had expressed its concerns over such a hybrid loan product as it could lead to higher rates of default in the home loan market, which is currently considered a safe haven for lending. The regulator then asked lenders to provide more against such loans, owing to their increased risk. Eventually, all the lenders had to withdraw their teaser products. \nAt an event in August 2015, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya had hinted that maybe the teaser loan product was needed to make a comeback, during a conversation with then RBI governor Raghuram Rajan. \n“I am told that real estate stock is at a two-year high and I was thinking if it is possible something of this (teaser loan) kind could be allowed given the fact that this is one of the portfolios where NPAs (non-performing assets) are the lowest,” Bhattacharya had said. \nIn February 2016, the lender had also launched a product called Flexi Pay where working professionals could avail a home loan with a two- or three-year moratorium where they had to pay only the annual interest and not the principal amount. After this moratorium, the equated monthly instalments (EMIs) would be raised to reflect the principal amount. \nIn its statement on Monday, SBI also talked about regular loan products. Customers can also avail a regular floating rate loan at a premium of 65 basis points over one-year marginal cost-based lending rate (MCLR), for loans up to Rs75 lakh. This means that such home loans will be priced at 8.65% interest. For women, SBI said that a fully floating rate home loan will be available at 8.6%. \nIn case of loans above Rs75 lakh, home loans have been priced at 8.65% and 8.7% for women and other customers, respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T10:59:58.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
