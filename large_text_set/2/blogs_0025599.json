Today’s recipe: garlicky, lemony shrimp with broccoli rabe. \nYou will barely have time to set the table before this dinner is ready to devour—the shrimp and the broccoli rabe cook on the same baking sheet, for an easy sheet pan meal. Leaving their tails on will keep the shrimp from curling up into tiny balls during cooking. Orzo pasta tossed with olive oil and Parmesan cheese is an easy accompaniment to round out the meal, but a loaf of crusty bread would be excellent as well. \n\nLemony Shrimp and Broccoli Rabe \n\n1 big bunch broccoli rabe, tough stems removed \n4 Tbs. (2 fl .oz./60 ml) olive oil \nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper \n1 1/2 lb. (750 g) tail-on medium shrimp, peeled and deveined \n2 tsp. Dijon mustard \nPreheat an oven to 400°F (200°C). \n\nPile the broccoli rabe on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle with 2 Tbs. of the olive oil, season well with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Spread the broccoli rabe in a single layer on half of the baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes. \n\nWhile the broccoli rabe is cooking, in a large bowl, combine the shrimp with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the mustard and garlic. Season well with salt and pepper and toss to coat evenly. Transfer the shrimp to a sheet of aluminum foil and spread in a single layer. Fold the edges of the foil up into a “bowl” so that the cooking juices don’t spill over. \n\nOnce the broccoli rabe has cooked for 8 minutes, transfer the shrimp with the foil to the prepared baking sheet and place next to the broccoli rabe. Roast until the shrimp are bright pink and opaque throughout and the broccoli rabe stems are fork-tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and squeeze the lemon juice all over the shrimp and broccoli rabe. Serve immediately. Serves 4. \n\n\n\nFind ways to make hectic suppers into fun, relaxed gatherings that the whole family can enjoy in our cookbook School Night , by Kate McMillan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T13:43:42.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
