Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. \nDirected by Zack Snyder, the screenplay is by Chris Terrio from a story by Snyder and Terrio. The producers are Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, Jon Berg and Geoff Johns.
