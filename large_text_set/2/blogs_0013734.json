(This is also why we’re imagining John Legend and Chrissy Teigen getting tipsy and watching Bravo in formal wear, for what it’s worth.)\nWhich, in case you’ve somehow missed their social media presence over the past couple of years, is absolutely their version of living their best lives.\nHemsworth, dressed like he was about to go on a dive with Team Zissou on the Belafonte, posted a shot of a hoodie-clad Cyrus enjoying two pups, a gorgeous (Malibu?) beach, and a cup of coffee. He captioned the pic with a Valentine’s rose emoji, which definitely counts as a sign of PDA from the typically more private half of the couple.\nHappy valentines \nA post shared by Liam Hemsworth (@liamhemsworth) on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:36pm PST \nCyrus added another of Hemsworth strolling with the pups down the shoreline, which, you know, looks like absolute heaven.
