Its sudden climb in the rankings came after President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway defended White House press secretary Sean Spicer by saying he had presented “alternative facts” when he insisted the inauguration crowd was much larger than what pictures showed .\nCommentators quickly noted that the term “alternative facts” had an Orwellian ring to it.\nIt’s unclear how how much Conway’s comments affected sales of 1984 , though one Amazon reviewer called Orwell’s classic a “perfect primer to POTUS 45” as he explained his decision to brush up on the book. In the comment, posted Tuesday, he continued to say that, “Kellyanne Conway announced that we were given alternate facts. Shades of changing the past and controlling the present…Get ready to party like it’s 1984.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T14:59:22.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
