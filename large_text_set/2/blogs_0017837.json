The strength of the projected 2017 field should bring even more attention and value to this year's first-round selections. We've already seen the draft come into play as part of the DeMarcus Cousins trade. The Sacramento Kings swapped out an All-Star for a potential lottery pick from the New Orleans Pelicans, along with Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway and a future second-rounder. There are nine college players who general managers should have in the back of their minds when looking to deal at the deadline. For the right team, these prospects could make a rebuild through the 2017 draft worth it to trade established, cap-clogging talent. Markelle Fultz (Washington, PG, Freshman) 2 of 10 Christian Petersen/Getty Images Markelle Fultz has superstar value for teams projected to draft top three. He's still on pace to become the only college prospect in 25 years to average at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists while shooting 40 percent from the three-point line. Fultz has emerged as the consensus No. 1 talent in a draft perceived to be top-10 strong. He projects as a full-service lead guard equipped with an advanced scoring arsenal and high-level passing ability, along with size and explosiveness that fuels upside. Acquiring the Brooklyn Nets' pick from the Boston Celtics would likely command an established franchise player like Jimmy Butler, Paul George or maybe Andre Drummond. But a team looking to start fresh that has a star to unload could roll the dice at the deadline for the chance to build around Fultz. Lonzo Ball (UCLA, PG, Freshman) 3 of 10 Robert Laberge/Getty Images NBA franchises looking for an identity change could already be thinking about Lonzo Ball at the trade deadline. No prospect has the potential to alter a team's playing style more or help maximize its talent like Ball. He's the driving force behind UCLA's No. 1 ranked offense that was No. 51 , per KenPom.com, with a similar core in 2015-16. The Bruins, last year's No. 73 -ranked team in tempo, are now No. 14 and average 22 assists per game after averaging between 14-17 in every season dating back to 2001-02. Ball's fast-paced attack and extraordinary passing create free-flowing ball movement and open shots. Given his unteachable, immeasurable strengths, he's to be scouted non-traditionally compared to previous guards and others in the draft. The fact that he continues to shoot the lights out helps lessen concerns over his scoring numbers (17.5 points per 40 minutes) for a perceived can't-miss prospect. Jonathan Isaac (Florida State, SF/PF, Freshman) 4 of 10 Rich Barnes/Getty Images A gambling general manager could view Jonathan Isaac as a top-three pick. He'll be worth it if he maxes out the potential his tools, quickness and skills create. Isaac jumps out as the ideal hybrid 4 in today's league, which covets power forwards who can shoot and use the dribble. Though skinny, Isaac plays stronger inside than his 210-pound weight, making 61.4 percent of his two-pointers and averaging 11.9 rebounds per 40 minutes. It's the perimeter game that separates Isaac from other 6'10\" players, though. Comfortable handling the ball and using it to separate into blow-by drives or jumpers, he can score effortlessly one-on-one from out to the arc. Light on his feet with fundamentally sound catch-and-shoot shot preparation, Isaac is just as capable scoring by working off the ball. Averaging 2.0 steals and 2.5 blocks per 40 minutes, he's been disruptive on defense, where he's also flashed promising versatility in pick-and-roll coverage. Playing a smaller role ( 21.4 percent usage ) with fewer minutes (25.2), Isaac's production (12.7 points) doesn't say \"must-have prospect,\" but the numbers still confirm effectiveness and efficiency. He's ranked top five in the ACC in the following categories: player-efficiency rating, box score plus-minus, true-shooting percentage, block percentage, two-point field-goal percentage and win shares per 40 minutes. Josh Jackson (Kansas, SG/SF, Freshman) 5 of 10 John Weast/Getty Images Josh Jackson continues to strengthen his case as top wing in the draft. And given the need for shooting guards and small forwards across the league, he'll be worth keeping in mind for a handful of teams at the NBA trade deadline. Explosiveness and jack-of-all-trades versatility create a high floor and foundation to build off. But over the past month, flashes of budding offense and volume scoring have helped raise the height of Jackson's perceived ceiling. At baseline level, he offers transition offense and the showtime athleticism that practically guarantees will translate. Above-average passing instincts are a part of the package as well. And though he's still rough around the edges on defense, Jackson's lateral quickness for a 6'8\" forward is undeniable. If he keeps trending upward as a shot-creator and shooter—he's averaged 19.3 points and made 16-of-31 threes over Kansas' last nine games—Jackson could evolve into the draft's most complete two-way player. Dennis Smith Jr. (North Carolina State, PG, Freshman) 6 of 10 Lance King/Getty Images A franchise looking to restart with one of the draft's freshmen floor generals could offer a star to the Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, Dallas Mavericks or Minnesota Timberwolves—teams projected to pick in the No. 4-8 range. That's where they'd have the chance to select Dennis Smith Jr., whose explosiveness, production, scoring and playmaking create exciting point guard potential. Smith backs up quickness and athleticism with sharp offensive skills by averaging 18.9 points and 6.6 assists . His brand of offense mirrors Damian Lillard 's as an attacking-style ball-handler who puts pressure on the defense with change-of-direction, hesitation and pull-up shooting. It's the Eric-Bledsoe-like burst that raises the bar, though. Questionable decision-making and leadership won't devalue Smith's talent for a rebuilding team whose guards have been weak. Malik Monk (Kentucky, SG, Freshman) 7 of 10 Andy Lyons/Getty Images Arguably the NBA's weakest position projects as the draft's shallowest in 2017. Teams like the Atlanta Hawks, Brooklyn Nets and Orlando Magic, who rank No. 25-30 in three-point shooting and have assets to trade, could think about going after a pick at the deadline for Malik Monk, the only natural off-guard prospect to get excited about. He's already hit a ridiculous 84 threes through 27 games at an accurate 41.4 percent clip. Monster production (21.4 points per game) and elite-level athleticism strengthen Monk's credibility when projecting him to the pros. Even in February, NBA teams should feel confident in his potential to inject their offense with firepower and shot-making. For a smitten general manager, the possibility of Monk improving as a playmaker and developing into a superstar combo could make him worth prematurely targeting and eventually reaching on in the draft. Jayson Tatum (Duke, SF, Freshman) 8 of 10 Lance King/Getty Images It's easy to picture Jayson Tatum scoring in the NBA with his prototypical forward size, advanced skills and production. Rebuilding teams looking to unload talent for a top-10 pick could target Tatum for his half-court offense. He's flashed exceptional shot-creating and shot-making, as well as the ability and confidence to take over games. Already with a deep arsenal of moves, including pull-ups, step-backs, jab-step jumpers and fadeaways, Tatum projects as an option coaches can feature. His tools, quickness and playmaking (1.3 steals, 1.3 blocks per game) help hint at untapped defensive potential as well. Extremely polished for a teenager—physically, fundamentally and mentally—Tatum comes off as one of the 2017 draft's surest bets. Robert Williams (Texas A&M, PF, Freshman) 9 of 10 Robert Laberge/Getty Images Robert Williams has all but locked up the title of most compelling defensive big. A team such as the Denver Nuggets, who rank No. 30 in defensive efficiency , may want to consider offering a starter for a chance to add Williams in the draft. He protects the rim with NBA tools (6'9\", 237 lbs, 7'4\" wingspan ), blocking 4.3 shots per 40 minutes and 11.7 percent of opponents' two-point field goals while on the floor, tied for the sixth-best mark in the country. The fact that he's also swatted eight three-point shots is a tribute to his length, foot speed and all-around defensive versatility. Over the past month, he's teased with more frequent flashes of mid-range shooting and interior offense. Williams is still raw but shows the potential to improve as a scorer. Either way, the likelihood that Williams can toughen up a defense could make him a predraft target for a team in need. Lauri Markkanen (Arizona, PF/C, Freshman) 10 of 10 Christian Petersen/Getty Images Lauri Markkanen's size and three-point track record make him easy to identify and seek out for NBA teams that need frontcourt shooting. At 7'0\", he's making 2.1 triples per game at a scorching 45.7 percent clip. He already jumps out as an ideal fit alongside an interior-oriented, defensive big man. Markkanen creates spacing with his silky-smooth jumper but also offense thanks to impressive ball-handling skills and mobility. Because his stretch 4 (or 5) identity is so well-defined, he's the type of player a general manager (looking for Monk's particular strengths) could track and covet from October to June.
