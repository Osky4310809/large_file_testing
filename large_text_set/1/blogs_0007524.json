It’s one of the best parts of these award shows, to find inspiration for our own look and Lucy Hale’s sleek hairstyle for the Golden Globes immediately caught our eye.\nWhen you think of these big fancy celebrity events, we’re used to seeing glammed up hair with long loose waves or intricate pieces that tie up the locks into a ultra-fab updo.\nBut, the Pretty Little Liars’ star had a look last night that proves sometimes simple is the only way to go. A photo posted by Lucy Hale (@lucyhale) on Jan 8, 2017 at 8:18pm PST \nThe 27-year-old actress hit up the Golden Globes after parties wearing an incredible black floor-length Christian Siriano gown. It was pure elegance. The dress has an eye-catching crackle pattern on the bodice, but her hair is what tied the whole thing together.\nGetty Images / Gregg DeGuire Kristin Ess, who owns Kristen Ess Hair, is the wizard behind Lucy Hale’s look. It’s nothing but chic-goodness. She parted the actress’ dark bob right down the center and used her magic to make it sleek ( read: somehow there are no flyaways ) and it’s giving us LIFE.\nSimple + Chic always wins. @lucyhale @kdeenihan @taraswennen \nA photo posted by KRISTIN ESS HAIR (@kristin_ess) on Jan 8, 2017 at 8:30pm PST \nYou can tell Lucy Hale felt gorgeous because she exuded confidence, and we’re totally here for that. Also, we’re totally trying this hairstyle for the office tomorrow.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:11:35.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
