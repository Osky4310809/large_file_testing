But it comes with a few caveats, including the fact that you generally can't run different instances of the same app in both windows.\nGoogle Chrome, however, is smart enough to juggle tabs between windows, letting you view different pages in each half of the screen. It's a neat trick that you might not be aware of, so here's how you do it.\nCreating two Chrome windows \nOpen Chrome Long-press the recent apps key to open multi-window mode. Tap the overflow menu (three dots) in the top right corner Tap Move to other window That's it! Your Chrome tab will pop into the lower half of the screen. And you can use this feature to juggle tabs between the lower and upper half's of the screen at will.\nOpening a link in a new window \nFirst, you'll need to have Chrome open in multi-window mode. Long-press the link and tap open in other window That's it! The link will pop into the lower window and you'll be good to go, with the original page up top and the new one down below.\nIt's worth remembering that you can open links from the lower window in the upper one using this trick - it doesn't matter which window you're starting from.\nHappy multitasking!\nAndroid Nougat Android 7.0 Nougat: Everything you need to know Will my phone get Android Nougat?
