King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 11 hours ago 11 \nDiscussing his signature ESP LTD Sparrowhawk guitar, Mastodon's Bill Kelliher said that with the way music gear has developed, super high-output pickups have become less and less needed for a great metal sound. \nThe guitarist told Total Guitar about the pickups his six-string is loaded with: \"These are called the Divinators - they're not quite as hot as [Bill's older pickups] Dissonant Aggressors, but they sound great. They're very unique, very transparent. \n\"Nowadays, I use Axe-Fx and Friedman amps, the sound is kind of already in the amp, you don't have to use crazy super-high-output distorted pickups. These are kinda in the middle somewhere.\" \nDuring the rest of the chat, Bill also singled out the \"three main tunings\" of Mastodon - D standard, open C, and drop A - stressing that the Sparrowhawk can easily take changes between 'em without a hitch. \nYou can check out the full guitar rundown below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:01:57.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
