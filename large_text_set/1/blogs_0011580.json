Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIt wasn't to be Liverpool's night in the first leg of their EFL Cup semi-final clash at Southampton, with Nathan Redmond's early goal giving the Saints a 1-0 win . \nJurgen Klopp's side were well below par throughout the evening, never really getting going and in truth more than a little fortunate that it was only the one goal that they lost by. \nThey'll try and put that right in the second leg at Anfield in two weeks' time, as Klopp's efforts to rectify things on Wednesday evening didn't work out. Not even all the shouting and clapping in the world could save Liverpool (Photo: Ian Walton) Daniel Sturridge with the note (Photo: EMPICS Sport) \nIn an attempt to gee up his team, the German boss was seen passing a note to Daniel Sturridge via Adam Lallana and Emre Can during the second period, and Twitter immediately began to wonder just what could be on it. \nWe think we've got it worked out though. It's one of these five suggestions: Kick it in the goal \"Ohhhh. The goal? Gotcha.\" (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nSimple, but Liverpool seemed like they needed it. Trying running around a bit more \"Down I go\" (Photo: Andrew Powell) \nTo be fair, it wasn't just Sturridge who needed telling about this one. Tell Emre to pass to a green , yellow , Toxic Thunder shirt He's probably just given it away (Photo: Reuters) \nBecause whatever colour it is, he clearly couldn't see it at St Mary's. You got Sadio's number? The missing Mane (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nBecause he's needed back pretty sharpish on this evidence. Do you like my dance? \nNeeds a bit of work, just like the second leg will. poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:14:01.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
