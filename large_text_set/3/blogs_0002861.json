The March 8 strike will take place in more than 50 countries around the world, calling for gender equality, reproductive health access, labor rights and an end to gender violence.\nSEE ALSO: 13 mildly sassy out-of-office replies to use when joining the Women's Strike\nWhile U.S. Women's Strike organizers said the movement was created by working class, black and migrant women — groups who often experience the most economic inequality , yet are still taking the personal risk — joining a strike arguably requires privilege . This could leave out women in low-paying jobs and hourly work, who might not have the same freedom to strike as women with more financial stability.\nMany women will still work on March 8 out of necessity, and that's a decision everyone should respect. But even if you can't afford to leave your job on Wednesday, there are still ways you can participate in the Women's Strike.\nHere are just a few things you can do to speak up, act out and make a difference on A Day Without a Woman.\n1. Avoid shopping for the day. Sisters, one week from tomorrow we have the opportunity to show that our country would down w/o us. #StrongerTogether #DayWithoutAWoman pic.twitter.com/1jwWNRPs8E\n— Robin (@Robins_Tweet) February 28, 2017\nWhat would happen to the economy if women didn't buy anything for an entire day? There's only one way to find out.\nWomen's Strike organizers encourage those who can't take the day off work — and even those who can — to avoid spending money on March 8. The goal is to recognize the value and power of women by recognizing what they bring to the economy.\nSimply put: A woman's economic value isn't only in the work she does, but also in where she chooses to spend her money.\nIf you do need to shop, Women's Strike organizers suggest spending your money at small businesses, especially those owned by women and people of color — if they're not already striking, of course.\n2. Wear red in solidarity. We call on ALL who believe that women's rights are human rights to wear RED on 3/8 in solidarity with #DayWithoutAWoman . Are you with us? pic.twitter.com/AouASLnNFb\n— Women's March (@womensmarch) March 6, 2017\nWhether it's an entire outfit or a simple ribbon, Women's Strike organizers want women and allies to wear red on Wednesday. Organizers chose red because it's the color of \"love, revolution, energy and sacrifice.\" It's also associated with past labor movements , which also fought for human rights — particularly for immigrant workers.\nThough it might seem like a small gesture without much of an impact, wearing red is an accessible way to connect with a movement in which you might not be able to participate otherwise. Similar to the pink pussyhats that dominated the Women's March in January, wearing red will visually tie you to a community of women taking bold action for equality.\n3. Show your support IRL and on social media. SAVE THE DATE: \"A Women's Strike Is Being Organized for March 8th.\" https://t.co/FAGBWXcdTY pic.twitter.com/Hc188CyJT3\n— Craig Bowman (@craigab1) February 23, 2017\nWomen's voices are often silenced, but the Women's Strike is a time to be heard.\nEven if you have to work, use your voice to talk about equality and the movement for women's rights, and support those who are striking. Whether you're in the office, at the grocery store or on Twitter, speak up to assert how valuable you and other women truly are.\nOn social media, use the hashtag #DayWithoutAWoman to speak out. Your voice and your platform have power.\n4. Strike from gender expectations.\nImage: Women's Strike\nIf you can't strike from work, consider other ways you can take action in your own life — like striking from gender expectations.\nOrganizers suggest striking from things like child care, emotional labor and housework, if an opposite-gender partner can pick up the slack. Organizers also recommend striking from \"polite\" responses to catcalling, fake smiles and even makeup.\nStriking can take many forms — get creative.\n5. Consider attending a rally. @ACLU It's time! pic.twitter.com/PZtZIas906\n— Rogue Photographer (@david_films_nyc) January 21, 2017\nJust because you can't take the day off work doesn't mean you can't participate in Women's Strike events. Check out the roster of local rallies in your area in support of the strike, and attend one taking place after work hours.\nRallies are a core part of the strike, offering a space for women fighting for gender equality and human rights to connect and amplify each other's voices.

Donate to women.\nWomen living in a women's shelter receive donations of socks, a highly under-donated item.\nImage: Raglin/AP/REX/Shutterstock\nOrganizations that focus on the needs of women can always use financial help to fund the work they do. However small the amount, consider giving to women-focused nonprofits on March 8. Especially for local organizations, even $5 can make an impact.\nIf you can't afford to take the day off work, however, you might not have the financial resources to donate money. But there are other cashless ways to give to women's charities.\nGiving gently used clothing to a women's shelter, for example, is a great way to give back to women in need. Consider digging through your closet for clothes you no longer need or don't fit anymore. Whether it's two or 20 items, a small donation of essentials can make a difference.\nWATCH: Across the globe, nasty women and men hit the streets after Trump's inauguration", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/womensmarch/status/838751031546757124", "https://qz.com/924575/womens-strike-2017-a-day-without-a-woman-is-going-to-be-mostly-a-day-without-privileged-women/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yrC2n47bqwgNVxpEJyda4zT84ew=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405838%2Ff5bef7e3-44b3-4ff8-afa4-e93915dd2dd9.jpg", "https://www.womenstrikeus.org/about-the-iws/", "https://t.co/PZtZIas906", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrongerTogether?src=hash", "https://www.womenstrikeus.org/events/2017-03-08/", "https://twitter.com/ACLU", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/GKKo9U7E.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/DayWithoutAWoman?src=hash&lang=en", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/eyI8WWVmLCUk5uxud_dUaaa7Vfw=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405844%2F10da9594-ce82-4552-8cc9-9bcec1c25f4c.png", "http://www.womenstrike.org/&quot;>Women", "https://t.co/1jwWNRPs8E", "http://www.womenstrike.org/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/DayWithoutAWoman?src=hash", "https://t.co/AouASLnNFb", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/GKKo9U7E.jpg", "https://eh.net/encyclopedia/labor-unions-in-the-united-states/", "https://www.womensmarch.com/womensday", "https://twitter.com/david_films_nyc/status/822820349075189761", "https://t.co/FAGBWXcdTY", "http://www.aauw.org/aauw_check/pdf_download/show_pdf.php?file=The-Simple-Truth", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HXJ6YzbmT8dJTIrCYKMGfk1e6ko=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405844%2F10da9594-ce82-4552-8cc9-9bcec1c25f4c.png", "https://twitter.com/Robins_Tweet/status/836695148817956864", "https://twitter.com/craigab1/status/834820402874576902", "https://t.co/Hc188CyJT3", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/F4KwuwNGikhoP69jh-I0OgtuZbM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F405838%2Ff5bef7e3-44b3-4ff8-afa4-e93915dd2dd9.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-08T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:05:05.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
