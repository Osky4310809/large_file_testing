Speaking to Entertainment Tonight at the premier of “Fifty Shades Darker”, the 34-year-old actor said that three years after shooting the first film, he and the actress are “great friends”. “(Now) it’s been three years, (and) Dakota and I are very close. We’ve got a great sort of love and respect for each other. We’re great friends… So it’s definitely more comfortable,” said Dornan. Also, the 27-year-old actress said that their close connect helped them with their intimate romantic scenes in the film and the second instalment will not have sequences “definitely not as petrifying” as in the 2015 movie. \nFifty Shades Darker had its premiere in Los Angeles on Thursday. The film also has a number of steamy scenes between the two. Dakota Johnson confessed that she takes some swigs of whisky before filming the nude scenes. The second film deals with the part when Ana (Dakota Johnson) gets back in Christian’s life (Jamie Dornan) after she left him. She also has to deal with his other jealous lovers and the one who introduced him to the BDSM lifestyle. The first part ended with Ana dumping Christian because she did not like that kind of romance.
