This is really starting to get irritating.\" \nFor the time being, there's still no official word from PlayStation and the server status page is still showing as all services as working fine. \nThe Ask PlayStation Twitter support team have not responded to the flood of questions asking about the state of PSN. \nHowever, we imagine they'll tell you, like they have on other occaisions, to send over any \"error codes or messages when you try to connect to the network?\" PS4 System software 4.50 Update - Screenshots Friday, 3rd February 2017 Get a run-down of the biggest features in the forthcoming update. 1 / 5 Sony Custom Wallpapers \nIt comes just days after PSN was hit by a similar outage over the weekend, as fans were greeted with maintenance error messages. \nThat was despite the fact that there was no scheduled maintenance confirmed for that day. \nFans reported (WS-37432-9) error codes, although the problem was fixed in a relatively short period of time. \nPerhaps it's connected to the new PS4 update, which is currently being tested by beta members. *** We will continue to update this story until the PSN servers are back online for the majority of people *** Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:23:45.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
