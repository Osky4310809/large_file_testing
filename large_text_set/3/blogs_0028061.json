Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. \nAfter the viral success of Netflix's Making a Murderer , the streaming giant is dipping its toes back into true crime for an in-depth look at the infamous, unsolved murder of JonBenét Ramsey with Casting JonBenet . It's been 21 years since the 6-year-old beauty queen was found murdered in her family home, but interest in her death has far from waned. In 2016, a number of TV specials aired about her, but Netflix's feature-length documentary — which has the same slick, stylized, look its docs are becoming known for — is a hybrid of fiction and nonfiction filmmaking that took place over the course of 15 months in Ramsey's Colorado hometown. It aims to figure out why this crime's legacy continues to capture the nation's attention, and the official trailer and teaser will leave you unsettled, to say the least. It arrives on Netflix on April 28. Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:02:52.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
