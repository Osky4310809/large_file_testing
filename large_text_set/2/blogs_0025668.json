Does not look respectful in the Oval Office,\" one Twitter user said. \nAnother said: \"To be fair we shouldn't expect people born in barn to know any better. No respect for the highest office.\" \nWhile the moment also sparked an outpouring of memes. \nTrump was meeting with the leaders of the nation's historically black colleges and universities at the White House, committing to a partnership between his administration and the schools. \nConway has faced scrutiny over her conduct as an adviser to the president. Last week, a group of 15 legal ethics professors made a complaint to the Bar, accusing her of misconduct.
