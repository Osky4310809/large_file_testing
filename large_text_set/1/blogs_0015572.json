During his press conference last week, the president-elect thanked Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for recently announced U.S. investment plans that are expected to create a combined 2,700 jobs. \nHe then turned up the heat on GM to follow suit. “I hope that General Motors will be following. And I think they will be,” Mr. Trump said. \nThey did indeed, even if GM's response was largely predictable. Recall that GM CEO Mary Barro was appointed to Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum , which as a reminder \"is composed of some of America’s most highly respected and successful business leaders, will be called upon to meet with the President frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his plan to bring back jobs and Make America Great Again.\" \nIt would look confusing if one of Trump's own economic policy advisors looked the other way when practicing what Trump is preaching. \nOn January 3, Trump launched the opening salvo in this brief but productive \"negotiation\", when he tweeted that “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!.” General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 \nGM picked the middle option: to invest money in the US, creating new jobs. \nIn keeping with the narrative proferred by other carmakers, in an interview with the WSJ, GM general counsel Craig Glidden declined to confirm specifics of the announcement but said any investment the company might disclose has been long planned and isn’t a response to pressure from Mr. Trump. \n“This is something we’ve been undertaking for some period of time,” he said. “It’s really getting our story told in a way that is I think complete and fulsome.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T03:07:20.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
