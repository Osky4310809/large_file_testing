Patrick Aisowieren (Edo-APC). \nMoving the motion earlier, Aisowieren said that the Benin-Ugo-Abraka road was the shortest route between Benin City, the Edo c apital and Delta. \nHe also explained that it was about the only Road Project embarked upon by the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs and was of immense economic and social benefits to the people of Edo and Delta States. \nAisowieren expressed concern that the abandonment of the project had rendered it impassable and was causing hardship on commuters plying the road. \nThe lawmaker said that the abandonment of the project also hindered the conveyance of agro-allied products around the communities. \nThe motion was unanimously adopted by members after it was put to vote by the Speaker, Mr Yakubu Dogara. \nThe house, therefore, urged the Federal Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs to take urgent steps to mobilise the contractors back to site to complete the project. \nIt mandated the Committee on Niger Delta Affairs to ensure implementation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T20:34:38.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
