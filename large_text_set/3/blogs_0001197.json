He gave up $14.5 million in injury guarantees for the ability to opt out of his deal at the end of the year. \nWhen the 49ers hired Kyle Shanahan as head coach and John Lynch as general manager, there was some speculation that they would try and keep Kaepernick around. His play last season was far better than the play that saw him benched in favor of Blaine Gabbert in 2015. In 12 games, Kaepernick completed 59.2 percent of his passes for 2,241 yards with 16 touchdowns against just four interceptions.\nThere was talk of Kaepernick no longer trusting the 49ers as early as 2014, and his divorce from the team has been building for some time. But given his play last season and the chance that the 49ers might keep him around at his previous contract, it’s still somewhat surprising to see him choose now to move on. \nThere’s the thought that the 49ers will push hard to acquire a new starting quarterback this offseason. They had been linked to Kirk Cousins, provided Washington let him hit the open market, and to a potential trade for Jimmy Garoppolo of the New England Patriots. \nPlus, the 49ers have the second overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and if both free agency and the trade market don’t bring a starting quarterback, the 49ers could go with a quarterback early. Even if they wait until the second round.\nWhat’s next for Kaepernick is a little less clear. Obviously, Kaepernick wants to continue starting in the NFL, which means his options are limited. Still, at 29 years old and possessing both an incredibly strong arm and rushing ability on par with any other quarterback in the league, it’s hard to imagine him not landing elsewhere. A quarterback-needy team should like his potential enough to sign him, though what kind of contract he ends up with will be very interesting. He’s made a lot of money over the past few seasons, after all.\nThe 49ers have Gabbert and Christian Ponder at the quarterback position but not much else now with Kaepernick opting out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T16:39:09.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
