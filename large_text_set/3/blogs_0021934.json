operation to save her  35 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online Omsin rests next to a tray of coins that were removed from her stomach at the Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters \nA 25-year-old Thai sea turtle has died from blood poisoning, never recovering from an operation to remove 915 coins from her stomach, thrown into her pool for good luck, veterinarians said. \nThe green turtle named Omsin, “piggy bank” in Thai, underwent a seven-hour-long operation this month to remove 5 kg (11 lb) of coins which she had mistaken for food. \nBut Omsin, who lived at a conservation centre in Chonburi, east of the Thai capital Bangkok , was rushed into intensive care on Sunday night, breathing too slowly. She received an emergency operation on Monday, after which she went into a coma. \nHer fate had preoccupied Thais, who cherish turtles as a symbol of longevity, and the vets had urged people to pray for her recovery. \n“Her cause of death is blood poisoning,” one of the vets told reporters. \nThe gap in Omsin's stomach left by the removal of the coins caused her intestine to become strangled, blocking blood flow, the vets said. Acute infection in the intestine then caused blood infection.
