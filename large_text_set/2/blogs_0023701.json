Jeremy Corbyn Credit: Peter Byrne/PA Wire \n\"I was elected to lead this party. I am proud to lead this party,\" he told reporters. \n\"We will continue our campaigning work on the NHS, on social care, on housing.\" \nC ritics on the backbenches warned however that he had become an \"obstacle\" to victory and urged him to step down in the interests of the party. \nThe victory for Tory candidate Trudy Harrison was the first time a governing party had gained a seat in a parliamentary by-election since 1982 and represented a historic achievement for the party after seven years in office. \nThere was some consolation for Labour in Stoke-on-Trent Central, where it saw off a concerted challenge from Ukip leader Paul Nuttall - albeit with a reduced majority. \nBut there was despair among Labour MPs at the defeat in Copeland in an area which has long been regarded as safe Labour territory. \nJohn Woodcock, the MP for neighbouring Barrow-in-Furness, said the party was not an effective opposition and had to do better. Watch | Paul Nuttall: \"I'm not going anywhere\" 00:58 \n\"There are always excuses you can make. But we are in trouble as a party,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \n\"We are on course to a historic and catastrophic defeat and that will have very serious consequences for all of the communities that we represent.\" \nS enior Labour backbencher David Winnick said it had been a \"disastrous\" result for the party and urged Mr Corbyn to consider his position. \n\"The party is faced with the problem of a leader who is simply not acceptable to a large number of people who would normally vote Labour. That it is an obstacle and it would be wrong not to recognise that,\" he told the Press Association. \n\"It is now entirely up to Jeremy and those close to him to decide what is best in the interests not simply of the party but the people we are in politics to represent.\" \nDespite the despair among Labour backbenchers there appeared to be little appetite for a fresh leadership challenge after Mr Corbyn's crushing victory in last year's contest. \n\"That would be quite useless. It would end in the same result as previously,\" Mr Winnick said. \nOn a tumultuous night, Ms Harrison polled 13,748 votes to 11,601 for Labour's Gillian Troughton, increasing the Conservative vote share by more than 8% as Labour's dropped by nearly 5%. \nShadow chancellor John McDonnell, one of Mr Corbyn's closest allies, said there had been \"unique\" factors in Copeland which is heavily dependent on the Sellafield nuclear facility. \nHe said the party had had enough of \"macho leaders\" and that voters would respond to Mr Corbyn's consensual approach . \n\"Jeremy has a sense of duty. He will lead this party. He will rebuild it as a social movement, as we are doing now, and on that basis we will win the next election and he will be the prime minister,\" he told the Press Association. \nHe also hit out at Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson for high-profile interventions in the days before the by-elections. \n\"We can't have a circumstance again where a week before the by-election a former leader of our party attacks the party itself,\" he told the Today programme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:38:25.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
