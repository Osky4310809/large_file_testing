Quit the person who I know you don’t want to give up on. Quit the attention you give to someone else who doesn’t care to give you theirs. Quit the person who doesn’t respect you enough to even answer. Quit settling. Quit thinking you can love someone into liking you. \nI hope you quit your past and stop letting it dictate your future. I hope you quit holding onto your mistakes and not giving yourself the forgiveness you deserve. \nI hope you quit holding onto your ex because they are an ex for a reason. Quit turning to them when you’re lonely because it’s better to be alone than be in the wrong company.\nI hope you quit answering that text at 3 am or answering the person who only texts you when they are bored. \nQuit everything and everyone in your life who doesn’t deserve you. I hope you find the courage to quit dating if you aren’t ready and take time learning to love yourself and learn what you want in life. \nI hope you finally decide to quit hating yourself. I hope you quit trying to change who you are to appease others. I hope you quit looking at your reflection in the mirror and telling yourself you aren’t great. \nI hope you quit lying to yourself. Whatever that lie may be that’s on repeat in your brain. \nI hope you finally find the courage to quit the job you hate. Quit the people who are taking advantage of you. Quit doing something that makes someone else happy and go find something that makes you happy. Quit living according to someone else’s standard and go create your own. \nQuit killing yourself to make someone else’s life easier because I know what it’s like to be miserable and be busting your ass when you know in your heart something isn’t right. Quit adding unnecessary pressure to your life. Quit comparing yourself to others and thinking you need to be where they are. Quit thinking you are in a rush to get somewhere.\nQuit the path you aren’t happy walking on. \nQuit living someone else’s life. Quit living someone else’s dream. Quit that voice inside your head that tells you, ‘that idea won’t work or it’s crazy.’ Do it anyway. \nI hope you quit holding things off until tomorrow. I hope you quit saying, ‘you’ll be happy when.’ Quit thinking you don’t deserve happiness right now and go out and get it. \nI hope you quit trying to be normal and find the courage to go off the path a little even if you don’t have a plan or know where you are going. \nI hope you quit your fears and do that thing that scares you. Go to that place, meet those people, get on that plane and quit thinking you need to come back. \nI hope you quit the bad company. Quit the people who tell you, you can’t and surround yourself with those who encourage and motivate you. Quit those who aren’t bringing you to the next level. Quit the people who aren’t making you the version of yourself you want to be. \nQuit thinking you don’t deserve the best of everything. Quit pushing that one person or thing away because you’re afraid to be happy. Quit thinking you’re better off alone because this life wasn’t meant to be lived by yourself. You were meant to share in all the great moments and not be met with loneliness. \nQuit running from that person you know loves you because you’re scared of not being able to reciprocate it. Go get what you deserve. \nI hope you quit unhappiness. Quit depression. Quit negative people. Quit doing everything you are doing that isn’t bringing you ultimate happiness. Quit before it’s too late. \nQuitting something doesn’t make you weak. Staying does. Staying the path is easy. Routine is easy. Losing yourself to something that doesn’t make you happy happens every day. Then next thing you know, years have passed and you wonder where the time went. \nDo not settle. In life. In your career. In your relationships. In love. I’ll say it again, do not settle. \nI hope you find the type of courage inside yourself to quit. \nQuit until you are living the type of life that gives you a reason to put two feet on the ground in the morning. \nQuit until you are doing something that makes you not want to sleep at night because the reality you created is better than any dream. \nBe sure to look back at your story and remember the day you starting living was the day you quit. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T04:01:30.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
