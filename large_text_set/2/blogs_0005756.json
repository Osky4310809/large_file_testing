The argument I have made about a vote over the last three months is that the vote must cover the article 50 deal and any future relationship and that it must take place before the deal has been concluded,” Starmer said. \nA surprised Starmer was then left struggling for issues to talk about, since he said Labour’s demands for a meaningful vote at the end of the negotiating period had “been met in large part”. \nThe issue initially appeared to satisfy the Labour frontbench but a number of MPs stood up to urge Jones to outline further details about the form of the vote, given parliament was about to proceed with a four-hour debate on the issue. \nBen Bradshaw, a Labour former minister, said the scope of the vote was equally important, as MPs could be “faced with a choice between hard Brexit and World Trade Organisation rules, which is no choice”. \nKen Clarke, the pro-EU Conservative former chancellor, warned Labour that “leaping on a concession may be unwise before we are sure what it amounts to”. \nJones confirmed later that a House ofCommons vote on the Brexit deal would be on a “take it or leave it” basis, meaning the government would not go back the negotiating table with Brussels if MPs did not like the proposal. \nAlex Salmond, the SNP former leader and first minister, said the government’s conduct was unacceptable, as Jones had not put forward an amendment to the Brexit bill to guarantee the timing of the vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:44:44.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
