Maybe you've let them know you're holding a party in advance, or some such.\nWhatever good deed you might have done, it pales in comparison to the generosity 31-year-old Chris Salvatore has shown his neighbour Norma Cook. She's just become his new roomie.\nSEE ALSO: 'Google changed my life': The real-life subject of 'Lion' on tech's role in his miraculous story\nSalvatore, a California-based actor and singer, first met the 89-year-old Cook almost four years ago, when he moved into the apartment block she'd been residing in for 35 years. The pair became great friends, but their friendship was put to the test when the leukemia Cook had been battling for ten years was diagnosed as terminal.\nDoctors gave her mere months to live, and said she would need around-the-clock care. Rather than allow Cook to be taken to a hospice, Salvatore stepped up and said she could come and live with him.\n\"She's been living in the apartment across the hall for the last 35 years, and that's probably the longest place that she's kind of called her home,\" Salvatore told Australia's The Project .\n\"I just couldn't do that to her, I just couldn't rip her out of her own home.\"\nSince they moved in together, the pair have become inseparable, with Salvatore uploading photos of their many adventures onto Instagram.\nNorma is such a ‚≠êÔ∏è.

I read all of your messages from around the globe to her and she cries every time she hears the kind words from all of you. We just want to both say thank you for all of the love and support. It keeps Norma healthy and definitely keeps my energy up to be able to care for all her needs.
