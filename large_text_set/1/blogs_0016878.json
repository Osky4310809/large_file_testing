Click here! \nYou learn something new every day; what did you learn today? \nSubmit interesting and specific facts that you just found out (not broad information you looked up, TodayILearned is not /r/wikipedia ). Posting rules \nSubmissions must be verifiable . Please link directly to a reliable source that supports every claim in your post title. Images alone do not count as valid references. Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, Discovery, etc). \nNo personal opinions, anecdotes or subjective statements (e.g \"TIL xyz is a great movie\"). \nNo recent sources. Any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) more recent than two months are not allowed. \nNo submissions regarding or related to the following Recent politics/politicians Police misconduct Inflammatory submissions relating to religion/race/gender \nNo misleading claims . Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed. \nRephrase your post title if the following are not met: Titles must begin with \"TIL ...\" Make them descriptive, concise and specific (e.g. not \"TIL something interesting about bacon\"). Titles must be able to stand on their own without requiring readers to click on a link. Starting your title with a why/what/who/where/how modifier should be unnecessary.* \"TIL about ...\" and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try /r/Wikipedia , etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word \"about\"). \"TIL how to ...\" posts belong on /r/HowTo . \nNo submissions related to the usage, existence or features of specific software/websites (e.g. \"TIL you can click on widgets in WidgetMaker 1.22\"). \nAll NSFW links must be tagged (including comments). Please see the wiki for more detailed explanations of the rules. \n( Why we need rules ) Additional info \nIf your post does not appear in the new queue and you think it meets the above rules, please contact the moderators (include a link to your reddit.com post, not your story). \nPlease report spam, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate posts by messaging the moderators , as this helps us remove them more promptly! \nMore information available on the TIL FAQ and wiki.
