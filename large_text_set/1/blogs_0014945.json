( AAL ) has won the 2017 Airline of the Year award, according to a press release. The award has been given out annually for the past 43 years by media company Air Transport World (ATW). It will be presented at a gala dinner in New York on March 28. \nIn order to win the award, ATW says an airline must “demonstrate exceptional achievements and capabilities across operations, financial performance, customer service, safety and labor relations. Its executive leadership must also clearly show innovation and strategic thinking that sets the company apart.” \nThe award was given to American Airlines in part because of its seamless integration of US Airways. ATW says the merger was “the largest, most complex airline merger in history.” The merger closed in late 2015 after a year and a half of uncertainty and delays.

The airline also spent billions to upgrade its aircraft. \nDoug Parker, chairman and CEO of American Airlines, said in the ATW press release, “It was another phenomenal year for American Airlines, and all the credit goes to our team. Our 120,000 team members completed several crucial integration milestones, launched 67 new routes, took delivery of 115 new aircraft and much more – all while running a solid operation and taking great care of our customers. While we still have much to accomplish, we're incredibly proud of the work these men and women are doing every day to restore American as the greatest airline in the world.” (See also: American Airlines CEO Cashes Stock Rights Worth $9.47 Million .) \nThis year marked the first time since 2015 that an American airline has won Airline of the Year. In 2015, Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV ) took home top prize.   ( DAL ) won in 2014. Other recent winners include Etihad Airways in 2016, ANA in 2013, Air New Zealand in 2012 and Emirates in 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T05:27:44.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
