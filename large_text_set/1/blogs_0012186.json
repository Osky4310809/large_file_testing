While the Indian actress rocks the film industry, she doesn’t forget that there are important social issues around the globe to be taken care of. \nA photo posted by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Apr 30, 2016 at 8:48pm PDT \n\nMichelle Obama – who will retain the FLOTUS title for a few more days before handing it over to Melanie Trump – was photographed alongside Chopra more than six months ago at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the latter teased that she will be working with the First Lady on women empowerment, with special focus on education. \nLast year, the 34-year-old Chopra was in the US to complete shooting for Baywatch, which marks her Hollywood debut. She will commence promotional efforts for the new film, which is scheduled for release on May 26, 2017 in America. \nTimes of India reveals that the idea came into being after the two powerful icons talked about Chopra’s work with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The Indian star expressed awe at how Michelle Obama was up-to-date with her social work. \nIn an official statement, Chopra commented, “She (Michelle Obama) discussed the work I do with UNICEF and how we should work together for the education of the girl child. It was like they knew all about me. Can you imagine being the head of State and having to keep in mind everyone, but being able to do that? That, to me, was impressive,” IndiaTimes reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T09:12:44.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
