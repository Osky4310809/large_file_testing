On Sunday, he was headed to another victory when his car had an issue with 2 laps to go. 6 The Joe Gibbs Toyotas should improved speed at Las Vegas, after a disappointing Atlanta weekend. 7 Ryan Blaney Now in his second year with the Wood Brothers, Blaney had one of the fastest cars in the field, despite some odd vibrations at several points in the race. 8 Jamie McMurray Traditionally, Las Vegas has not been a great track for McMurray, but he had a good finish this time. 9 A three-time Las Vegas winner barely cracked the top 10. 10 The new kid on the block at Stewart-Haas Racing had the team’s best finish. 11 Jimmie Johnson After a pair of disappointing races to start the season, the seven-time series champion wasn’t great here, either, 12 Early on, Kahne has been one of the pleasant surprises of the season. 13 The 2011 Daytona 500 winner had a decent outing. 14 So far, 2017 has been better for Almirola than 2016 was. 15 Erik Jones The rookie won a Truck Series race here before, and in his first Monster Energy start at this track, he did a solid job. 16 Dale Earnhardt Jr. In the previous six Las Vegas races, Earnhardt finished in the top 10 every time. Today, he didn’t. 17 Ryan Newman Newman, who had three top fives in the previous six races here, couldn’t match his best runs. 18 Michael McDowell This track had been a challenge for McDowell, who in seven starts here has never finished better than 29 th here.

He didn’t get going early and fell off the lead lap. 22 Kyle Busch \nBusch was lined up for a top-10 finish until he made contact with Joey Logano and spun off of Turn 4. He got into a scrap with the crew of the No. 22 after the race. 23 Chris Buescher \nBuescher didn’t have a great day but it was a step in the right direction for the No. 37 JTG Daugherty Chevrolet. 24 AJ Allmendinger \nThe JTG Daugherty cars found themselves right near each other at the end of the race as Allmendinger tried to get some points back after his lug nut infraction at Atlanta. 25 Austin Dillon \nThe No. 3 Richard Childress Racing Chevrolet didn’t show the same speed at Las Vegas that we saw in the first two weeks of the season. 26 \nThe 2017 season has been an improvement for DiBenedetto and the Go FAS Racing group. 27 Landon Cassill \nThe Front Row Motorsports duo has struggled to start the season and again found themselves near each other at the end of the race. 28 Cole Whitt \nAfter two impressive results to start the season, Whitt came back to reality at Las Vegas. 29 David Ragan \nA new sponsor is a good omen for Ragan but he didn’t get the result he wanted. 30 Kurt Busch \nThe Daytona 500 winner was frustrated all day and needed to make a battery swap that killed any chance of a comeback for him. 31 \nSorenson made another start for the No. 55 Premium Motorsports team. 32 Ricky Stenhouse Jr. \nStenhouse had a rear axle issue in the closing laps and went from a top 20 to the back of the pack. 33 \nThe fourth generation Earnhardt continues to log laps in the No. 33 car. 34 Gray Gaulding \nThe rookie has had a rough go so far with the No. 23 BK Racing team. 35 \nCope made back-to-back starts in the Cup Series for the first time in years. 36 Danica Patrick \nThe No. 10 SHR Ford lost an engine late in the race and turned a bad day worse. 37 Timmy Hill \nThe No. 51 team exited the race early and Hill finished near the back of the field. 38 Kevin Harvick \nHarvick blew a tire early and ended up smashed into the wall and out of the race. 39 Corey LaJoie \nIt’s been a year full of hits into the wall for the driver of the No. 83 team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T02:01:39.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
