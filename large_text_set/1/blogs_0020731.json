Chef Kevin Meehan and partner/wine guru Drew Langley have created something special : an easygoing restaurant that can go both high and low, putting together a versatile menu that comes with a ton of heart and technique.\nAnd now they’re getting a bit of the Chef’s Table- esque treatment, thanks to Jon Berkowitz and producer Simone Benyacar of Crispy Bits . The gorgeously shot short film above walks through the growth of the restaurant , the spirit of what Meehan and Langley are trying to do, and Meehan’s own personal perspective on being a chef and owning his own restaurant. Enjoy.\nPretty Much Every Critic Love Kali on Melrose [ELA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:40:49.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
