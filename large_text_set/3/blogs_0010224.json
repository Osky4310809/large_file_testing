I am a professional. I defend my club.

When they have somebody who wins four Premier Leagues for them, I'll be No2. For this moment, Judas is No1. \n“I left the club last season in the Champions League, winning the Champions League group, in the knockout phase playing the second leg at home. If they won the Champions League last year, they'd be playing in Europe this season. \n“It's not my fault. It's the ones that stayed here and didn't win the Champions League. What I share with them is that we didn't have a good Premier League, and I share responsibility with that.” Mourinho talks with referee Michael Oliver (Photo: REUTERS) Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho applauds supporters (Photo: AFP) \nMourinho and Conte shook hands in the tunnel after the game but the United boss was clearly angry at referee Michael Oliver for sending off Herrera. \n“Compare Herrera's second yellow card with that of a couple of minutes later when Rashford goes to attack the space and the Chelsea captain grabs him, stops him in a counter-attack. Mr Oliver does not give a card, not even a yellow,” said Mourinho. \nUnited could also face an FA rap after their players surrounded Oliver following the red card while Rojo’s stamp could also result in a retrospective ban. \nBut Conte angrily accused United of trying to ruin the game by kicking Hazard off the pitch.

For 20 or 25 minutes, it was impossible for Hazard to play football. \n“I see only that he got a lot of kicks. But I don't think I'm crazy and I see only him in this situation. This is my reply to the question. \n\"Hazard, for 25 minutes, it was impossible for him to play football. Only kicking.
