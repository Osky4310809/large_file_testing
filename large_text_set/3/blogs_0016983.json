The players leaving accounted for quite a bit of snaps for a unit that finished 14th in yards allowed and fifth in points allowed this past season.\nThe Cowboys just lost 50.1% of their 2016 CB snaps via free agency as Brandon Carr signs with the Ravens, Morris Claiborne with the Jets. pic.twitter.com/GkeXa3Ehzk \n— Pro Football Focus (@PFF) March 16, 2017 \nDL Jack Crawford (529) – Falcons\nDL Ryan Davis (155) – Bills\nDL Terrell McClain (471) – Redskins\nCB Brandon Carr (1015) – Ravens\nCB Morris Claiborne (406) – Jets\nS Barry Church (675) – Jaguars\nS JJ Wilcox (557) – Buccaneers \nLB Justin Durant (282) – Unsigned\nLB Andrew Gachkar (75) – Unsigned \nThese exits seem to have many fans of America’s Team in a panic, but fresh blood has been the calling card of the Cowboys’ defense throughout the Rod Marinelli era, so hope is not lost. \nThe Cowboys did not make much of an attempt to retain any of the above players because Stephen Jones and company knew they would leave for more money elsewhere, and frankly, the team is ready to bring in younger players with more potential. \nFor starters (literally), Dallas has four such players already in the fold: Anthony Brown, Jaylon Smith, Charles Tapper and Jeff Heath. Brown already proved capable, logging over 700 defensive snaps in his rookie season. He has already arrived as a key contributor for the Cowboys. The list doesn’t end there. \nSmith and Tapper were 2016 draft picks that didn’t play at all last season due to injury. But to say The Star in Frisco is abuzz about these players’ potential in 2017 is an understatement. \nContinue to read more on how these snaps will be replaced.\n1 2 3 4 5 … 6 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T03:37:03.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
