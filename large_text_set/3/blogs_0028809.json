Then the red eye . Now, it's rare to get through a day of Instagram scrolling without coming across \"halo eye.\" \nMore and more beauty-lovers, and especially artists and bloggers, are ditching multidimensional smoky eyes in favor of a cleaner and often brighter ( peach and orange are huge right now!) wash of one shadow shade on the lid and along the lower lash line, connected at the sides to create an entrancing \"halo\" around the eye. \nMakeup artist Ashlee Glazer says the key to mastering the look is to go big. \"Apply a primer (such as Urban Decay Primer Potion ) to help set the shadow and ensure it doesn't wear throughout the day. Then, use an eye shadow brush (like MAC #239 ) to apply the desired color to the entire lid, stopping just short of or going slightly over the crease line. Finally, using the same brush, sweep the same shade along the lower lash line, connecting the color at each corner,\" Glazer advised. \nIf you really want to amplify your look, Glazer suggests adding a touch of highlighter just below the brow line and in the inner corner of the eye. \"Complete your look with two coats of volumizing mascara (like Smith & Cult Lash Dance Mascara in Radio Silence ). Bonus points if you add false lashes!\" she said. \nNow that you have the basics down, read through and be inspired by some of our favorite Instagram \"halo eye\" looks. We suggest you go with a lighter shade for day, then ramp things up with a darker or brighter shade come evening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:49:07.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
