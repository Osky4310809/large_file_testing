During Monday’s broadcast of the Knicks’ matinee against the Hawks, MSG play-by-play Mike Breen suggested Jackson and Anthony clear the air with a meeting. However, Frazier insisted the problem was on Anthony’s end.\n“I think the players should be more like Phil Jackson, just keep their mouths shut and just play ball,” Frazier said.\nAnthony has insisted in the past he would not waive his no-trade clause, but there continues to be an apparent rift between the team president and star player. Jackson criticized Anthony for his lack of ball movement earlier this season, prompting Anthony to respond on Instagram. But Frazier was leery of Jackson being the source for Rosen’s column, which was published Thursday on FanRagSports.com. \nSEE ALSO \nCarmelo Anthony: If Phil Jackson wants me gone, let's talk :0 TORONTO — Carmelo Anthony has no proof Knicks president Phil... Carmelo Anthony: If Phil Jackson wants me gone, let's talk “He can’t respond if Phil Jackson didn’t say that, that was someone else that said that. It wasn’t Phil Jackson, it was some guy that’s affiliated with him, supposedly,” said Frazier, a teammate of Jackson’s on the Knicks in the ’70s.\n“So you can’t get caught up with that in today’s media. Plus, it’s nothing new, Melo. When I played they blamed me when we lost, they blamed Willis Reed. That’s why you are getting big bucks. They want you to deliver and it has to happen on the court. Talk isn’t going to get you anywhere. You can’t have rabbit ears.
