That’s why there are fraternities for males and equal social organizations of sororities for females. Because there are social organizations for males and females that means that it is not a violation of Title IX, which states, “ No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” But that isn’t stopping a student group at Yale University from demanding that women be allowed to join fraternities. \nEngender, a student group at Yale University, is attempting to lobby the administration to allow women into all-male fraternities. They are citing Title IX as the basis for their argument and stating that fraternities are discriminating against women. \nFrom Yale Daily News :\nAccording to co-directors of Engender, the fraternity Sigma Nu declined the request for female and nonbinary students to attend rush events by citing the right to free association for an all-male institution. Chi Psi made an explicit note that, as per the bylaws of their national organization, females are not allowed at their rush events, Engender co-directors said. …\nMcGrew said that for many of the fraternities they contacted, their national bylaws were likely not specific in how they define gender requirements for recruitment versus membership. For example, SigEp’s national organization notified its Yale chapter that coed rush events would be fine as long as no females received bids, he said.\nCo-directors of Engender, including McGrew, anticipated that following its recent campaign, many fraternity national organizations will define their bylaws to include more explicit gender requirements for the rush process. But from the perspective of some national organizations, only people eligible to join the fraternities are actually considered to be actively rushing.\nWith the conclusion of Greek life recruitment, Engender — a student group that coordinated the attendance of female students at the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon’s rush events — plans to take its course to the next stage and lobby the Yale administration to intervene in the single gender membership policies of fraternities by helping local Yale chapters navigate the gender requirement bylaws of their national organizations as well as prepare the wider student community for a social system in which more gender inclusive spaces exist on campus.\nBut oddly, the group is not demanding that sororities must accept men. Hmmmm. But, I thought this was all about “equality.” \nWhy would women want to even be in a fraternity? Do women want to chug vomit to be in a frat ? And what happened to the narrative that all frat guys are sexual predators? And if that is your belief then why would you want to live in the same house with all that toxic masculinity ?\nFor colleges that are vocal proponents for “safe spaces,” one would think that a safe space for young women and young men would be appealing. \nThis comes on the heels of Harvard punishing students for joining frats and sororities . Beginning in the fall, the university will penalize any students who join any unrecognized single-gender social organizations by banning them from becoming an athletic team captain as well as leadership positions in all recognized student groups. \nWomen in a fraternity would really ramshackle the elephant walk. But it would make the paddling sessions into the most anticipated hazing ritual. \n[ FoxNews ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:51:50.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
