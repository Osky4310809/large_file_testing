(Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images) \nBOSTON (CBS) – I’ve never really understood why immigration issues drive people so crazy. Since all of us who aren’t Native Americans are immigrants or the descendants of them, the notion of people coming here seeking a better way of life seems not just benign, but a central part of being an American. \nBut between real problems that immigration can sometimes cause to our culture’s apparently built-in fear of immigrants, we have a long history of turmoil surrounding them. \nDid you know Massachusetts was a hotbed of support for the so-called Know Nothing anti-Catholic movement in the 1850s? Their bigotry is part of a regrettable American tradition that runs through the Ku Klux Klan to the birther movement. \nWho wants any stone left unturned in the work of screening immigrants or refugees for signs of terrorist intent? Not me. \nBut an effort to make good on a Trump campaign promise to tighten up the vetting process seems to have been executed with a haste and ideological zeal unsuited to such a sensitive and complicated issue. People gather at Copley Square January 29, 2017 in Boston to protest President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive order, which restricts refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.

They couldn’t give him a week or so to get his feet wet and make sure this new refugee ban would be executed properly? \nRidiculous. \nBefore Friday’s rookie mistake, the Trump administration seemed to be making progress in consolidating business and political support. Now, after one arrogant spasm, potential allies are furious with them. \nImmigration is one of those perennial hot-button issues. \nWhen you carelessly meddle with it, it seems, you can get burned. \nListen to Jon’s commentary: Jon Keller Follow Follow Jon on Twitter E-Mail Jon Keller Jon Keller is WBZ-TV News' Political Analyst, and his \"Keller At Large\" reports on a wide range of topics are regularly featured during WBZ-TV News at 6PM and 11PM.
