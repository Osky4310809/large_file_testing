As in cruelty-free products that look amazing without using fur or other animal byproducts, and that often come from recycled materials. \nWhich is why we are pretty much obsessed with Emma Watson’s latest all-black, eco-friendly ensemble . We first got wind of the look on Watson’s brand new, Beauty and the Beast Instagram account , which is devoted to the film’s current press tour. She’s already shared several glorious designer outfits , as well as some behind-the-scenes antics. And now, she’s graced us with even more style perfection.\nA post shared by The Press Tour (@the_press_tour) on Feb 21, 2017 at 12:54pm PST \n“ Faux leather jacket and dress by @stellamccartney ,” she wrote in the caption. \nShe also added, “ Boots by @goodguysdontwearleather . The brand doesn’t use any animal products in its collections, which are made in Porto, Portugal, helping preserve the traditional shoe making industry of the region.” \nvia GIPHY \nAnd eco-friendly aside (which we can’t stress enough how much we love), can we just take a moment to discuss how GOOD our girl looks?! This all-black aesthetic looks comfy and casual, yet perfectly pulled together. It’s also a great reminder that faux-leather can look every bit as fabulous as the real thing.\n\nAs Watson also noted in her post, the next leg of the tour will take the team back to her home-base in London (the tour started in Paris with a surprise screening, because, well, BONJOUR!). It will then eventually make it’s way across the pond to the U.S. — presumably with ample time to prepare us for the official March 17th release date.\nWatch the brand new clip of the song \"Belle\" from #BeautyAndTheBeast and see the film on March 17: pic.twitter.com/Gkxp6BSEHv \n— Oh My Disney (@OhMyDisney) February 20, 2017 We were BORN READY for this movie, and at risk of sounding melodramatic, we feel like we’ve been waiting 10,000 YEARS for it! Needless to say, we can’t wait! Oh, and also can’t wait to see what other eco-friendly fashion choices Watson has up her sleeve.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:33:04.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
