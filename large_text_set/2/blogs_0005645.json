We were blessed with a video of her taking a dip in a little pool .\nBecause Fiona was born six weeks premature, caretakers have been constantly monitoring her health and vitals. On Sunday, they happily reported that Fiona was strong enough to take her first steps and also shared a video of the event.\nEncouraging news from hippo headquarters! This video, taken by animal care staff overnight, shows Fiona's 1st steps! https://t.co/RywHq2zIcl pic.twitter.com/9gcr4LHgru\nâ€” Cincinnati Zoo (@CincinnatiZoo) February 5, 2017\nFirst steps are really tough, as your past baby-self can tell you. But even though she is wobbling, Fiona clearly nailed her first time moving on her own four feet.\nGet it, baby girl! We're so proud of you.\nFiona had another good night and drank more from her bottle this afternoon than she has to date. She is now able to suckle both in and out of the water and is gaining weight. As of this morning, she was up to almost 37 pounds!
