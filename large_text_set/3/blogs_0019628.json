Some of those things, like spending a lot of money on infrastructure or on the Mexican border wall, will speed up the clock while other “things,” like more revenue pouring into the Treasury from added jobs and a faster-growing economy, will slow the debt clock down.\nAnd by “things,” I mean practically anything that could ever happen.\nTo make matters a bit more cloudy, the Treasury Department, which maintains the official debt stats, has a different number from the debt clock.\nOne of them is promoting fake news.\nHey, our country is in serious financial trouble. But that doesn’t mean we can’t have some fun with it.
