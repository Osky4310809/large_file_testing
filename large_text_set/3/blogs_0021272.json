The interference from solar radiation is particularly harmful to geostationary satellites — they’re the ones responsible for TV and radio broadcasts, and telecommunications.\nUniversity of New South Wales’ School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications senior lecturer Dr. Elias Aboutanios said these interferences are called sun outages.\n“Most geostationary satellite communication works in the microwave [frequency]. And the sun transmits those same frequencies,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Company .\n“[At the equinox] it’s like you have this tiny light bulb, passing in front of a massive projector. You can’t see the light bulb. The background noise — provided by the sun — blinds you from seeing the satellite, much like with visible light.”\nAboutanios said the of multiple satellites sharing the same signal can help reduce the level of interruption but admits that this solution is usually too expensive when the outages are so brief.\n“If you place another satellite such that it’s displaced from the first satellite by more than the period of the outage then you can hand over the signal, and when that second satellite experiences its own outage, then you hand back,” he said.\n“It’s quite expensive to mitigate the effect by focusing an antenna on another satellite, so it’s kind of accepted that you have a degraded picture quality or a broadcast is interrupted for very short periods in the year.”\nWhile the equinox has already occurred, the weeks following are when you might notice the disruption because that’s when the sun, satellites, and Earth receivers align.\nSpace weather expert Dr Brett Carter said because of a difference in latitude, not all cities would experience the disruption at the same time.\n“As you start to move away from the equator, the geostationary satellite belt is like a ring around the Earth. You could imagine where the shadow of those satellites falls on the Earth changes with the day and the latitude,” he said.\n“The lower your latitude, the closer to the equinox your maximum disturbance will occur.”\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on News.com.au .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:21:59.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
