After eight seasons of blood-sucking, curses, resurrections, and epic romances, The Vampire Diaries wrote its final chapter last night. SPOILERS AHEAD! The supernatural drama concluded in its usual breakneck fashion, with Stefan (Paul Wesley) sacrificing himself to kill Katherine (Nina Dobrev) in hellfire. He vowed eternal love for his new wife, Caroline (Candice King), who ended up starting a boarding school with Alaric (Matt Davis) and some other familiar faces (Steven R. McQueen’s Jeremy!) and received an impressive donation in the mail from Klaus. Stefan also paved the way for his brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder), to live out his life with Elena (also Dobrev), who ultimately went to med school. Bonnie (Kat Graham), who’d saved the day, was finally ready to live again — she set out to travel the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:48:08.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
