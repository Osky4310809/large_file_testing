Carphone Warehouse is the only retailer in the country currently taking pre-registrations for the feature phone, and says the demand for the 3310 has been ‘unprecedented’. “Levels of pre-registrations at Carphone Warehouse are incredibly strong, proving that it’s not all hype and that consumers really want to get their hands on one,” said Andrew Wilson, UK director of buying at Carphone Warehouse. The 3310 is something of a cult product, and has a massive fan following worldwide. The relaunched classic boasts features like a 2.4-inch colour display, 2MP camera with flash and even a modern version of the popular Snake game. While many users are keen to get their hands on the phone just for nostalgia’s sake, the actual use cases of the phone are limited in several countries around the world. This is primarily because the 3310 is a 2G-only device, and 2G networks have been switched off in major markets like the US and Australia. The Nokia 3310 is expected to land in India in May or June this year. Priced at €49 in Europe, it’s expected to cost around Rs 3,000 when it lands in India, which will make it expensive for a feature phone. It’s uncertain how much of the interest in the 3310 will translate into sales for HMD Global, so we’ll just have to wait and watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:20:37.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
