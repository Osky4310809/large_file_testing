This deployment has the potential to further destabilize the already fragile security situation in Tripoli. \nLibya should work to build a unified national military force under civilian command that is capable of providing security for all Libyans and combating terrorist groups. Disunity and lack of coordination among Libyan forces only benefit ISIS and other terrorist groups seeking to exploit Libyan territory and resources. \nWe continue to encourage all Libyans to support political reconciliation and the Government of National Accord (GNA) as it works‎ to address Libya’s critical security and economic challenges, preserve Libya’s unity, and oversee the transition to a new government through peaceful elections, within the framework of the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA). \nWe urge all parties to renew efforts toward national reconciliation through political dialogue.
