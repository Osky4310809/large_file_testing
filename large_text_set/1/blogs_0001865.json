Bush’s and Bill Clinton’s terms, roughly three-quarters of Americans said they had confidence in the newly elected President in these areas. \nWhen compared with Gallup’s averages of confidence polling in his predecessors, Trump comes up short. \nThe incoming president has a 32-point confidence deficit in his ability to avoid scandals in his administration, a 29-point deficit in his ability to use military force well and a 28-point deficit in his ability to manage the executive branch. \nMost Americans (60 per cent) believe Trump will be able to get things done with Congress, but even there he comes up far behind his predecessors — the average number of Americans with confidence in Obama, Bush and Clinton to work with Congress was 82 per cent. \nThe data also reflects a more polarised America than Obama or Bush faced when they came into office. \nOn average, only 21 per cent of Democrats have confidence in Trump’s ability to handle the various responsibilities of the presidency. \nBy contrast, roughly two-thirds of Republicans had some confidence in Obama and the same was true for Bush and Democrats. \nBut Trump even has a confidence deficit among members of his own party. \nOnly 84 per cent of Republicans have confidence in his abilities as President, compared with 94 per cent of Democrats who trusted Obama and 95 per cent of Republicans who had faith in Bush. \nThe poll’s sample included 1,028 adults and had a margin of error of +/- 4 per cent. \n(NAN)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T12:22:32.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
