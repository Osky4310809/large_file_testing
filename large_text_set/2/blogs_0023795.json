Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWayne Rooney has been warned that China will be no picnic for the Manchester United star should he elect to leave Old Trafford. \nRooney’s agent, Paul Stretford, has flown to China to negotiate a £600,000-a-week deal, with United ready to let Rooney leave by Tuesday’s CSL transfer deadline. \nThe England skipper is more popular in the Far East than even Lionel Messi but the only Englishman currently playing in China, Jack Sealy, says he needs to do his research ahead of a potential move. \nSealy believes that Rooney must be prepared for a multitude of changes: \"The culture is different, the food is different, the people are different and the football is different. “ \nIf Rooney wants to research what faces him should he follow through with his own personal Brexit , then the cautionary tale of England’s last great off-the-cuff talent would be one well worth familiarising himself with.

In the months prior to his six-game spell at Turf Moor, while still at Everton, he had been treated at an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona. Paul Gascoigne playing for Everton (Photo: Julian Hamilton) Gascoigne upon his arrival (Photo: Reuters) \nGascoigne initially failed to impress on his Chinese sojourn when on trial at first division side Liaoning Bodao, the former club of old Toffees teammate Li Tie. But he refused to give in on the game he loved. \n\"I still have something to give in football and I don't give a s*** where,\" he said. \"I don't care if it's at the end of the world.” \nThat end of the world was the edge of the Gobi desert, in one of China’s poorest provinces, at the very end of the Great Wall, where stifling summers and harsh winters couldn’t be more different and described in the documentary that accompanied Gascoigne’s move (Gazza - One Day at a Time), as “officially the most polluted city on Earth”. \nLanzhou remains in the world's top 10 for atmospheric pollution due to human activity, the industrial region overlaid by a layer of smog cause by car traffic and factory emissions. For Gascoigne, an icon after Italia '90 and Euro '96, it was a far cry from being adored at White Hart Lane, Wembley, Ibrox and Rome.

In front of a sell-out 20,000 home crowd, he took just 14 minutes to make his mark, opening the scoring in a 2-0 win over Hailifeng with what Bohong described as “a world-class goal”.

I couldn’t speak the language and none of the hotel staff could speak English. When I wanted some water I had to point at the fridge and try to indicate it was water I was after. It was like being locked in a cave.” \nNeeding ways to fill his time, Gascoigne used food as a vice, whiling away the hours between training with packets upon packets of dried beef, a local delicacy. The aforementioned documentary saw him cry “I just wanna be happy like,” at one moment of self-reflection, while another saw him bellow \"England, I miss you” as he sang in a karaoke bar, frequented by himself and painfully few others.

We ponder the numbers \nGascoigne fished in the pool at the front of his hotel, trying to catch Koi Carp with Jammie Dodgers just to pass the time between sleep and training. When a pair of friends came to visit, Gascoigne purchased a fake Rolex watch for 300 yuan believing himself to have knocked down the street seller from 500. \nIn actuality, he had handed over the local equivalent of two months’ salary, taken for a mug when the starter price was 50. Alone and unable to communicate, it was no surprise when his demons soon returned. Gascoigne was idolised - but ultimately alone (Photo: Reuters) \nGascoigne would score in his second game also, but as his alcohol addiction reared it’s ugly head once more, he returned to Arizona after just two months in the Far East. Due to head back in June, despite the outbreak of the SARS virus, Gascoigne never reappeared. \nEventually Gascoigne returned to Britain, declaring that he had gone on strike after the fallout over unpaid money. \n\"Nothing went wrong in footballing terms in China - I played two games and scored twice,” he declared. \"They just wouldn't pay my wages. It was very disheartening, I gave everything for them but they wouldn't pay me so I just came back. They wanted me to play football and not get paid. \n\"The Chinese club have still got my footballing licence and the whole thing is in the hands of my agent and FIFA. I am just waiting for the outcome and then maybe I will try to play abroad again.” Gascoigne warming up before a training match - he lasted only two months (Photo: Reuters) Read More Gascoigne's Euro 96 gem is my favourite England goal EVER, says David Seaman \nThat summer, Gascoigne had words of advice for a 17-year-old Rooney, already a senior England international, two years after he had first been spotted by the Geordie as he made his way through the ranks at Goodison Park. \n\"I watched Wayne when he was 15 at Everton. I saw him come on as sub at 15 in a youth game and score two goals and win the game for them. I said at the time that this guy would be very, very special. He'll develop into a great player.” Gascoigne tipped Rooney to become a great (Photo: Getty) \nRooney did precisely that, becoming both United and England’s all-time record goalscorer. While their have been off-field indiscretions, he has avoided the kind of destructive off-field temptations that Gascoigne proved unable. \nThe two will always be linked by how they burst onto the international scene, lighting up a major tournament with precocious wonder. \nNow, some 14 years apart, they may soon be further bound. The money Gascoigne found withheld pales in comparison to the £600,000-a-week Rooney stands to earn, and there is no question that China’s sporting boom under President Xi means the footballing situation is now far different and certainly far more professional.

Our reporters have their say \nA move to Shanghai or Tianjin could help him rediscover something that appears lost. Maybe he would thrive as the league’s marquee name; he unquestionably prefers being the lead man, given his assertion when returning to the England squad post-injury at the 2006 World Cup that ’the big man is back in town’. \nGiven his status and celebrity his reality would not be at some remote outpost, in contrast to his former hero. However, given the cultural differences, that doesn’t mean his existence he finds is likely to be any less lonely. \nYet, if Rooney does believe he’s done with English football, and wishes to make China Wayne’s World, he could do far worse than heed Gascoigne’s woe of yesteryear.
