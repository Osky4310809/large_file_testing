It fell way, way short of that mark. Nathalie Baptiste Jan. 20, 2017 12:05 PM Email Luis Alvarez/AP; screenshot from EarthCam \nDonald Trump said his inauguration would have \" record-setting turnout ,\" but a quick glance at bird's-eye photos of his event and Barack Obama's in 2009 shows how far that claim is from the truth. In recent days, various groups estimated that the crowd for Trump was likely to be between 700,000 and 900,000 people. In 2009, an estimated 1.8 million people flocked to the National Mall to watch the swearing-in of the nation's first black president. \nAn astonishing 10,000 charter buses applied for permits for Obama's event; for Trump ' s swearing-in, only 200 buses applied. In 2009, 98 percent of the city's hotel rooms were sold out. As of this Thursday afternoon, there appeared to be plenty of hotel rooms available. And while Obama's inauguration was a star-studded event , many celebrities declined to perform at Trump's ceremony, leaving him with bands that have almost completely faded from memory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T19:21:43.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
