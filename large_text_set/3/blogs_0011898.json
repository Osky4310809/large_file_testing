It doesn’t matter how it’s done. If I give you drugs for something, that’s a drug deal.” \n“Right,” Cuomo said. \n“You go to jail, OK?” Houck said. \n“Yes, but it doesn’t make him a drug dealer. That’s all I’m saying,” Cuomo insisted. \nTo recap: just because he was seen dealing drugs and was a drug dealer, doesn’t mean he was a “drug dealer.” \nUnderstand?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T14:11:40.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
