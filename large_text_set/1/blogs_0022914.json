Hosseini Bay has lived in the Boston area for approximately nine years. After a judge granted a case brought by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union Saturday night, Hosseini Bay was reunited with his wife and daughter, who had traveled with him to Iran but returned two weeks earlier.

I’m grateful for all the people back there, but it was chaotic.” Hosseini Bay reunited with his daughter after being questioned at Logan Airport. (WBZ-TV) \nAccording to the ACLU, the judge’s stay prevents the U.S. from deporting anyone with approved refugee status or a valid visa from the country. The ruling does not allow more refugees in, but it prevents the government from deporting anyone who has already made it to the country, such as refugees arriving at airports on Saturday. The judge ruled today that no refugees should be put back on planes and sent back to danger. \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) January 29, 2017 Signed judge's order.

Last week everything was normal. I would pick up my daughter from preschool, she was like everyone else, I was like everyone else. But now we’re different.” Families reunited at Logan Airport after a judge issued a stay on   freeze. (WBZ-TV) \nSen. Elizabeth Warren, who met with the family after Hosseini Bay was released, called Trump’s ban unconstitutional. \n“We do not discriminate against people based on their religion. Period,” she said. “What Donald Trump has done today is illegal. It’s unconstitutional and it chips away at the very foundation of what our democracy is all about.” \nACLU lawyers in Boston also headed to federal court late Saturday night to make sure the immigration order wasn’t being enforced in the city after the stay was put in place.
