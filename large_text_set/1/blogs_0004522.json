However, I think most people will be talking about the unexpected kiss between Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge. \nIn the comics, the two iconic characters are best known for competing against each other for Archie's affection. While it would make for a nice curveball to have Betty and Veronica become lovers, I'm going to assume — based on their P.E. clothes and the audience behind them in the gymnasium — that the kiss is purely for show. \nThe live-action series offers a bold, subversive take on Archie, Betty, Veronica, and their friends, exploring small-town life and the darkness and weirdness bubbling beneath Riverdale’s wholesome facade. The show will focus on the eternal love triangle of Archie Andrews, girl-next-door Betty Cooper, and rich socialite Veronica Lodge, and will include the entire cast of characters from the comic books—including Archie’s rival, Reggie Mantle, and his slacker best friend, Jughead Jones. \nRiverdale stars KJ Apa as Archie Andrews, Lili Reinhart as Betty Cooper, Camila Mendes as Veronica Lodge, Ashleigh Murray as Josie McCoy, Luke Perry as Fred Andrews, Cole Sprouse as Jughead Jones, Madelaine Petsch as Cheryl Blossom, Ross Butler as Reggie Mantle, Casey Cott as Kevin Keller, Mädchen Amick as Alice Cooper, and Marisol Nichols as Hermione Lodge. \nRoberto Aguirre-Sacasa (Supergirl, Glee ) writes and executive produces, along with exec producers Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and Jon Goldwater.
