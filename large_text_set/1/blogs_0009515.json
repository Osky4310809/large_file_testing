The closure comes after prosecutors across the US have aggressively targeted the site and its executives , claiming that Backpage facilitates and profits from pimping and human trafficking. CEO of Backpage charged with pimping over sex ads that allegedly led to forced prostitution Read more \nBut sex workers have long argued that Backpage provides a safe public platform to vet clients and report predators, and that without it, the industry will be pushed further underground. On Tuesday, activists said the termination had removed a source of income for many vulnerable people and would force some with no choice but to work on the streets where they are much more likely to face violence and police harassment . \n“A lot of lives are being destroyed,” said Kristen DiAngelo, executive director of the Sex Workers Outreach Project of Sacramento. “These are human and civil rights abuses. How many sex workers across the US now have no way to support themselves?” \nNewly elected US senator Kamala Harris led the fight against Backpage as California’s attorney general, repeatedly filing charges against the site’s operators, claiming the platform was an “online brothel”. But judges across the country have continually sided with the website and first amendment advocates , citing a law that is foundational to free speech on the internet , which dictates that platforms are not liable for the postings of users. \nDespite the legal victories, including the supreme court’s decision on Monday not to hear an appeal against Backpage, the US Senate has intensified scrutiny of the company with a report and hearing on Tuesday, leading the site to replace its adult section with a banner that reads “CENSORED” . \nTargeting Backpage, activists say, is part of a broader campaign by liberal and conservative lawmakers in America to further criminalize sex work, which research has shown does little to protect victims of trafficking while making it harder for consenting adult workers to safely do their job .

They’re thinking about paying bills and buying food,” said Kimberlee Cline, a Sacramento-based sex worker who used Backpage. “They’re saying if they can’t make money on Backpage today, they have to go and be on the streets tonight. \n“On the streets,” she added, “there’s no screening at all. It’s just based on gut.” \nThe ongoing political campaign to force Backpage to close is another example of how US lawmakers ignore sex workers in policy debates on trafficking, said Ellyn Bell, a former nonprofit director who has written about child exploitation . \n“Sex workers’ voices need to be taken into consideration,” she said, adding, “It really comes down to decriminalization. There has to be a platform where people feel safe.” \nIn recent years, the shuttering of other adult services sites has left workers with very few options. In some communities, a loss of online ad platforms has directly led to reports of increased arrests of sex workers and sexual assaults on the job. \nSince the Backpage news this week, DiAngelo said sex workers are already getting threats from pimps who are telling women they will now need to rely on them to get work. \n“We’re going to see so many more people trafficked and pimped. Violence is going to escalate,” she said, in tears. “The bottom line is we’re going to see bloodshed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:27:13.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
