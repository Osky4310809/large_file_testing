So it's my number one too!\" Atomic Kitten with Michelle Heaton Read More \n\"It's everyone's number one,\" replied Natasha. \nAccording to reports, there was \"awkward tension\" between Kerry and Natasha throughout the band's set. The band are in New Zealand \nThe odd vibe was apparently made worse when Kerry hit a few bum notes on the group's biggest smashes. \nThe female trio of Jessica Taylor, Kelli Young and Michelle Heaton looked fierce as they performed at Auckland's ASB Theatre in skin tight outfits and towering heels. Liberty X disappointed fans (Photo: wonderwomanshel/Instagram) \nFans were hard pushed to tell the difference between the threesome now and back in 2002 when they were formed out of the rejects of Popstars. \nOne disappointed reviewer wrote: \"The ladies proved they've still got it (and then some) but... you came all this way. And seemed super excited to be here. And we've waited 15 years for this. \nMirror Celeb has reached out to Atomic Kitten's rep for comment.
