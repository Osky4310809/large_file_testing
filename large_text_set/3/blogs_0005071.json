Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe quality of refereeing in the Premier League is under the spotlight again after a couple of poor officiating displays on Saturday. \nKevin Friend was the man in the middle at Old Trafford for the 1-1 lunchtime draw between Manchester United and Bournemouth and received widespread criticism for his performance. \nHe failed to show red cards to Tyrone Mings and Zlatan Ibrahimovic for separate incidents involving each other, while Andrew Surman was arguably harshly given his marching orders. \nMings appeared to stand on Ibrahimovic's head in the first half before the Swede exacted retribution with an elbow just minutes later. \nBoth men are now facing retrospective action after Friend failed to spot the two incidents.

Is there a rule that you're not allowed to do that? He's a human being, he's allowed to live his life I'd imagine, unless there's a rule that prevents him from doing that. \n\"As long as he stayed off the carbs because there's no carbs before Marbs!\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T12:33:15.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
