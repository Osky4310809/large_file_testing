In April she posted a video on Twitter explaining she was cutting her tour short due to family planning. <blockquote>“We’re in the second leg of the tour, and there actually has been a sudden change,” she said in the <a href=\"http://madamenoire.com/695696/janet-jackson-is-pregnant/\">April 6 announcement</a>. “I thought it was important that you be the first to know. My husband and I are planning our family, so I’m going to have to delay the tour.”</blockquote> It wasn't until October, however, that the singer put out an official, albeit brief, <a href=\"http://madamenoire.com/721475/janet-jackson-pregnancy/\">statement on her pregnancy</a>, saying: “We thank God for our blessing.\" https://www.instagram.com/p/BLdh7Foj0ha/ Janet and Wissam, who just turned 42 on January 1, have been married since 2012; this is their first child together.
