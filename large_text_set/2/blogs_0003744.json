But we can‚Äôt help but feel for the Atlanta Falcons and their fans. Not only are they still one of 13 NFL teams who have yet to win the Super Bowl, the Falcons are now in the record books as the only team ever to surrender a 25-point lead in the big game. \nThe pain of the loss was apparently too much for one instructor at Georgia Southern University to overcome on Monday to show up for work. SB Nation found an email sent by Georgia Southern instructor Tyson Davis , who canceled class for his students Monday, and cited the Falcons‚Äô defeat as the reason.

He knew a night‚Äôs sleep wasn‚Äôt going to be enough to get over this one. Many sports fans can relate. \n[ image via Rob Hainer ‚Äì Shutterstock.com ] \n‚Äì \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
