Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA bride's life was saved by an eagle-eyed medic who she bumped into while on honeymoon. \nDanielle McCulloch was holidaying in Cyprus just days after getting married when a doctor spotted a strange lump on her neck when she was in a supermarket. \nShe advised the 26-year-old that it looked suspicious and told her she should get it checked out as soon as she landed back in the UK. \nRemarkably, the newlywed was diagnosed with stage three thyroid cancer just weeks later by doctors who told her without treatment, it could have killed her.

Danielle, with husband Matt, is lucky to be alive (Photo: James Linsell-Clark / SWNS.com) \nAs both of their families were going to be all together, they found it the perfect opportunity for an intimate beach ceremony - with their children Louis, 9, and Imogen, 4, by their sides. \nBut just days after tying the knot, Danielle was out shopping with her grandmother Wendy who lives on the island, when they bumped into the doctor. \n\"She is my nan's doctor so she was introducing us,\" said Danielle. \n\"Almost immediately she asked what the lump on my neck was and whether I'd had it checked. \n\"I had only recently had my second child and had put around a stone in weight on, so I just put it down to changes in my body. \n\"I didn't really know how to take what she was saying as it was quite personal and out of the blue but she was quite insistent that when I got back to the UK I needed to go and see someone.\" Bride Danielle sought medical help as soon as she got home (Photo: James Linsell-Clark / SWNS.com) \nAfter arriving home to Peterborough, Cambs., Danielle struggled to get what the doctor had said out of her head and so went to see her GP. \nShe was immediately referred to a specialist for tests and a biopsy, however nothing showed up. \nDanielle said: \"I wasn't worried at all because I really didn't think there was anything in it. \n\"When the biopsy came back clear, I thought it was all just a fuss about nothing, but the doctors asked to remove the lump just to be safe. \n\"They carried out a pretty straight forward operation to take the mass off my left thyroid, and it was only later that they revealed it was in fact cancerous.\" \nDoctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge found Danielle was suffering from thyroid cancer.

It was literally this massive bombshell.\" Danielle and husband Matt with their children Louis, 9, and Imogen, 5 (Photo: James Linsell-Clark / SWNS.com) \nDuring her treatment, Danielle had to be kept in isolation away from her children, who she told she was turning into a 'she-hulk' to try not to worry them. \nShe said: \"The treatment was a really scary experience but compared to some treatment cancer sufferers have, it was a godsend. \n\"I had to stay away from my family and friends for a week. That was the hardest part of it. \nWe explained to my son that I was like the Hulk and would have this stuff in my system. \n\"My daughter was too young to understand. When I could see my children again and hug them it was great but I was a bit scared. \n\"I didn't want to hurt them.\" Read More Cervical cancer victim dies aged 25 after begging for smear test 20 times Danielle has been left with a scar on her neck (Photo: James Linsell-Clark / SWNS.com) \nDanielle, who works as a cleaner, has been left with a visible scar on her neck from the treatment and will have take medication for the rest of her life to do the work of her thyroids. \nShe will also have to return to hospital for bi-annual check-ups but now hopes to encourage others to visit a doctor to get any unusual symptoms checked out - no matter how small. \nDanielle added: \"People know their own bodies and when something doesn't feel right, they shouldn't just assume everything is OK. \n\"I'm lucky. The lump was large but contained. If I had left it much longer who knows. I knew something wasn't quite right but I chose to ignore my body. And to be honest I'd never even heard of thyroid cancer. \n\"It's a cancer maybe not a lot of people are aware about but to all my friends and family I remind them anything new or any difference in your body big or small, check it out. \n\"It only takes ten minutes and it could save your life.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T06:08:13.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
