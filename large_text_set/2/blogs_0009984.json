The courts stopped his Muslim ban. He has vowed to fight, but he's more likely to water down the original order. Knowing he can't force Mexico to pay, Trump floated the idea of a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports. That got howls all around. Mexico wouldn't suffer, American consumers would. As for China, Trump said in December he didn't want it dictating to him whether he can take a phone call from Taiwan's president. Last week, in affirming its \"One China\" policy, Trump allowed China to dictate to him. \nAs I said, things could change, but that seems unlikely. Trump didn't \"pivot\" after the GOP convention. He didn't \"pivot\" after taking office. And in addition to the above, the evidence of Trump's fundamental weakness is piling up. The bureaucracy is mounting an internal insurrection. His Cabinet nominees have faced historic opposition. The intelligence community is coming around to the idea that he is a pawn of Russian President Vladimir Putin. And the Republican establishment, having figured out that he's just one flattering remark away from changing his policy views, is playing him perfectly. \nUnder normal circumstances, it would be unfair to say that the president is weak because he runs into obstacles. Presidents are not kings. They must share power, abide by the rule of law and be accountable to the citizenry that gave him authority. But Trump is not a normal president and should not be judged by normal political standards. He himself won the presidency on the basis of his strength, that he alone can fix our nation's problems. Everyone else was weak. \nTime will tell if I'm wrong. But so far, the evidence isn't in his favor. Trump talked a good game during the campaign, but when it comes to the trials of governing, he's showing us that so far, he's a fundamentally weak president.
