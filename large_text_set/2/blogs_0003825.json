CREDIT: AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais President Donald Trump announced three executive actions addressing violent crime before Jeff Sessions was sworn in as attorney general on Thursday.\nBecause the full language of the actions is not yet on the White House’s website, the details contained within remains vague. But Trump said one of them would empower the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to “break the back of criminal cartels.” Trump also announced the creation of a task force to reduce violent crime, and an action directing the Department of Justice to stop violent crimes against law enforcement officers.\n“It’s a shame what is happening to our truly great officers,” Trump said.\nA couple weeks ago, Trump tweeted that he would “send in the Feds” if the Chicago homicide rate doesn’t fall.\nTrump has presented himself as a bringer of “law and order” through both the 2016 presidential campaign and the early days of his presidency. During his inauguration speech he made a colorful reference to “American carnage” and said there were “crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.”\nIf Chicago doesn't fix the horrible \"carnage\" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\n —  @realDonaldTrump \nAfter being sworn in, Attorney General Jeff Sessions gave a speech in which he said he agreed with Trump’s approach to immigration and that crime is on the rise nationwide. But in fact, the FBI’s national crime statistics show a decades-long, downward crime trend . Although Trump himself has referred to violent crime increasing in major cities — and it did indeed rise in some cities in 2016, in the long term — violent crime has overall declined .\n“We have a crime problem,” Sessions said. “I wish the rise we were seeing in crime today were an aberration or a blip. This is a dangerous permanent trend and places the health and safety of Americans at risk.”\nSessions also appeared to link undocumented people to lower wages for U.S. citizens.\n“We have an increased threat from terrorism … We need a lawful system of immigration. That’s not wrong or immoral and indecent … We need to end this lawlessness that threatens Americans’ safety and pulls down wages of ordinary Americans,” he said.\nTrump signs three new ‘law and order’ actions at Jeff Sessions’ swearing in was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:21:20.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
