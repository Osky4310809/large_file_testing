Call it the tire, the muffin top, or the dreaded jiggly belly – having extra weight around your middle, or anywhere else, is unhealthy and typically unwanted. Whilst a balanced diet and some exercise will send you on the right track to a healthier bod, you can also choose to sip this drink at night to let your metabolism reach never before heights and burn your fat. Up your metabolism with this herbal tipple \nOur metabolism is at its lowest when we are asleep, simply because the body is relaxed and in a resting state. A glass of this herbal drink can help raise the metabolism since it contains herbs and ingredients rich in antioxidants and digestives that help the body burn fat at a much faster rate, as well as detoxify and function at its optimum rate. All this will help you burn your fat faster! To make the drink \nBlitz together one cucumber, a bunch or parsley or cilantro, the juice of a lemon, 1 tbsp of grated ginger and aloe vera juice, and ½ cup of water. Strain and drink it just before you go to bed to burn your fat. Why do these ingredients work? \nThe vitamins and fiber found in cucumbers, along with its water content, makes you feel fuller and the more water you drink, the faster your metabolism will be. Cilantro or parsley are antioxidant-rich and tackle any water retention and bloating you might be facing while also helping in eliminating flatulence and acting as a blood tonic and blood purifier. [1] Both lemon and ginger are excellent digestive and detoxification aids that help burn your fat. \nAloe vera, too, is rich in antioxidants and stimulates the metabolism – it also soothes any internal inflammation in the digestive tract, thereby making the digestive system more efficient. [2] \nSo the bottom line is, this is a healthy drink that detoxifies you inside and out, aids in a healthier digestion, and also increases the metabolic rate – all in all, helping you to lose that stubborn fat much faster, as long as you couple it with a balanced diet and some regular exercise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:24:35.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
