Yes, the Cadbury Oreo Creme Egg is coming to the U.S. next month, TIME reports. The eggs are already available in the U.K. The “Egg n’ spoon” packages consist of four chocolate eggs filled with a whipped Oreo cream mixture and a small plastic spoon. \nTIME reports the eggs will hit U.S. shelves in mid-February at .99 cents \nWhen I first heard about these Cadbury Oreo Creme Eggs and how they were only available in the UK and Canada, I was heartbroken. How are we supposed to be land of the free, home of the brave and obese yet not have what appears to be one of the greatest confectionary concoctions on the planet? Falling behind our old landlords and extra polite neighbors to the North in anything, along with some of the other P.R. hits Old Glory has taken lately, had me wondering if just mayyyybe out country’s future was in trouble. \nAnd then this story dropped out of the blue and every ounce of faith I ever had in the red, white, and blue has been restored. Tell that clucking bunny that we will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight! We’re going to live on! We’re going to survive! Today (actually about a month from now) we celebrate our Cadbury Oreo Creme Egg Day! USA! USA! USA!!! \nAnd while I sincerely doubt that President-elect Trump had anything to do with this groundbreaking news, cryptically taking credit for it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world. \nh/t Corey", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:28:13.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
