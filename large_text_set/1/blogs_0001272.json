This represents an increase of 2,245,347, or 0.70 percent, from New Year’s Day 2016. \nThe numbers may come as a surprise to those who remember back on Nov. 20, 1967 when President Lyndon Johnson announced that the U.S. population had reached 200 million. \nNationally, the U.S. population grew by 0.7 percent to 323.1 million from July 1, 2015 to July 1, 2016.
