It reads as follows: \nJohnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic, swashbuckling anti-hero Jack Sparrow in the all-new “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.” The rip-roaring adventure finds down-on-his-luck Captain Jack feeling the winds of ill-fortune blowing strongly his way when deadly ghost sailors, led by the terrifying Captain Salazer (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil’s Triangle bent on killing every pirate at sea – notably Jack. Jack’s only hope of survival lies in the legendary Trident of Poseidon, but to find it he must forge an uneasy alliance with Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a brilliant and beautiful astronomer, and Henry (Benton Thwaites), a headstrong young sailor in the Royal Navy. At the helm of the Dying Gull, his pitifull small and shabby ship, Captain Jack seeks not only to reverse his recent spate of ill fortune, but to save his very life from the most formidable and malicious foe he has never faced. “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” also stars Kevin R. McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Golshifteh Farahani as the sea-witch Shansa, David Wenham as Scarfield, Stephen Graham as Scrum, and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa.

The classic Silly Symphony The Tortoise and the Hare was also released in 1935. The Disney Channel debuted the medieval adventure film Black Arrow starring Oliver Reed in 1985.

Disney Vault \nEach week we highlight an underappreciated Disney classic! This week we’re celebrating the 20th anniversary of Hayao Miyazaki’s 1997 animated masterpiece Princess Mononoke (“Mononoke-hime”), which was produced by Japan’s Studio Ghibli but English dubbed and distributed in the US by Disney. The story of a young prince who meets a warrior girl and gets involved in a primal battle between ancient forest gods and industrialists was at the time the highest-grossing movie in Japanese cinematic history, and was a major influence on the look and themes of James Cameron’s Avatar . It was also a watershed film for Miyazaki, as the Disney dub (translated by Neil Gaiman!) played a big role in popularizing the master animator’s prior and subsequent films in the States. \nIn honor of both its 20th anniversary and Miyazaki’s 76th birthday, GKids is re-releasing Princess Mononoke to U.S. cinemas in English-dub form on Monday, January 9 at 7:00pm. The celebration will include the never-before-released music video directed by Hayao Miyazaki titled “On Your Mark.” You can go to this link to purchase tickets through Fathom Events!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T04:49:43.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
