Sneaky, sneaky!\nRelated: Armie Hammer & Wife Welcome Their Second Baby! \nA rep even confirmed to People that the twosome have named their son Joshua Bishop Kelley Jr . While baby Joshua is Katherine and Josh's first biological child together, the couple have been parents for awhile now as they adopted their daughter Naleigh in 2009 and then adopted other daughter Adalaide in 2012. Now that's one big happy family!\nWe honestly couldn't be happier for Heigl and her man, it feels like it was just yesterday that these two were announcing their pregnancy . Time certainly flies, doesn't it?\nHowever, Miz Heigl isn't the only Shondaland vet to welcome a kiddo under the radar! In case you forgot, last month Katherine's former Grey's costar Ellen Pompeo was seen walking around with her husband Chris Ivery and a mysterious newborn. It didn't take long for the 47-year-old's rep to confirm that Pompeo and Ivery had welcomed their third child -- which was shocking since no one knew the TV star was gearing up to have another little one in the first place!\nIs it just us, or is everyone having their babies in secret these days ? LOLz!\nNonetheless, we just want to congratulate Katherine and Josh on their latest arrival.
