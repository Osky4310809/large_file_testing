Signing new players who can give the team something more it’s always positive.” \nLyon manager Bruno Genesio revealed that signing the 22-year-old is the club's main priority at the moment. \nGenesio's side currently sit fourth in Ligue 1, and are looking to bring Memphis in to close the gap on leaders Monaco. \n\"Memphis Depay is a player who I have made a priority. The intention is that we capture him as soon as possible,\" Genesio told reporters. \n'I'm a fan. He is a complete, powerful and fascinating player.\" \nMemphis joined the Red Devils for £25 million after a title-winning campaign with PSV in order to reunite with former Netherlands boss Louis van Gaal. The 22-year-old failed to break into the first-team in his first season, though, and has not been named on the bench under Jose Mourinho this season since he was an unused substitute against Arsenal.
