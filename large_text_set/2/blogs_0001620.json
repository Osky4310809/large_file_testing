So I said to Tim, be like Franco Baresi and just stay tight to him. \n\"But he was happy to come back. He is loving it here. He got some fluid out of his knee, he has had a good reaction to it, so we will see how he is for the weekend.\" \nAhead of the transfer deadline, Goal revealed how Celtic were unwilling to sell the 20-year-old former Fulham forward , who has 20 goals in 38 appearances since joining the Bhoys. \nRodgers did not want the France Under-21 international to leave in January, but may be willing to listen to offers in the summer after sealing the Scottish Premiership title. \nChelsea were also linked with Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon, but that move failed to materialise before the window closed. \nRodgers was relieved to keep the Scotland international at Celtic Park, and hopes that he can get the 34-year-old to extend his contract at the club. \n\"It was difficult for Craig because I don't think he is built for the stress,\" Rodgers said. \nFuming Mourinho slams Klopp behaviour \n\"He is a big guy who is calm and laid back and it probably got on his nerves. But I have reassured him that he is an absolutely massive part of what I'm doing here. \n\"You see the level of his game, his composure, his quality, everything. And I'm very hopeful that soon we will tie him down for longer here because he is a huge player in relation to how I want my team to operate. That will be our best signing once that gets done.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:20:41.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
