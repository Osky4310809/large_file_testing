Thousands of activists, workers, civil rights leaders and elected officials plan to march on the plant, 20 miles north of Jackson, this weekend in what organizers predict may be the Magnolia state’s largest protest since the Civil Rights era. They will be joined by Senator Bernie Sanders, Rep. Bennie Thompson, and actor Danny Glover. “The march is simply the first step,” Glover told Jezebel by phone this week. “These workers are prepared to confront history.”\nAdvertisement \n\nGlover grew up in a union family—his parents were postal workers—and has been involved in the Nissan workers’ campaign for the past four years. “When Nissan first came to Canton, the wages were good, benefits were acceptable, and they mostly employed permanent workers,” he said. “Over time, the relationship deteriorated: The workforce has expanded, but it’s 40 percent temporary workers, working alongside people making much more.” Efforts to organize the workplace have been met with intense opposition: “These workers have virtually no outlet to express themselves without being attacked, without being threatened in a very intense, palpable way.”\nSubsidized by state and local governments to the tune of $1.3 billion , Nissan opened the 4.7 million square foot plant opened in 2003, introducing car manufacturing to Mississippi for the first time. According to the company and local business groups , the factory has generated an average of $2.9 billion annually to the state’s GDP and created 25,000 jobs statewide. Nissan, which is owned in large part by the French car company Renault, employs approximately 150,000 workers globally, with factories in more than twenty countries, including Japan, Australia, Spain, the UK, Russia, Mexico, and South Africa. Workers in all of Nissan’s factories are unionized—except for those in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement \n\n“Why not us?” Morris Mock, a paint technician at the Canton plant, wanted to know. “Some people work with their heads down. They want to trust Nissan,” he told Jezebel. “This is the South. People are very loving, very trusting. And we’re grateful that Nissan is here!” With a median household income of just $40,593 and a poverty rate of 22 percent, Mississippi was the poorest state in the union last year ( as it was the year before ). “Nissan is in Mississippi because they were seeking cheap labor,” Mock said. “A lot of politicians made a lot of promises that they wouldn’t have to worry about unions.” (Mississippi is a right-to-work state, meaning that workers in unionized workplaces cannot be compelled to pay union dues.) “The workers are so scared. A lot of them support the union. Maybe even a majority. But even with a majority, there is still too much fear, too many threats, too much intimidation” to hold a union election.\nNissan has inundated workers in Canton with anti-union messaging almost from the day the plant opened, although those efforts accelerated in the mid-aughts, after organizers from the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (U.A.W.) first began contacting employees. According to a 2013 report from the Mississippi NAACP , commissioned by UAW, Nissan’s tactics at the time included gathering new hires in captive-audience meetings and overwhelming them with misinformation—not just about unions, but about Nissan’s relationship with unions. “When I got hired in 2004 they had us go through training at [an offsite training center near the plant],” Rosalind Essex, an engine quality technician, is quoted in the report as saying. “I remember them starting off saying ‘Nissan is a nonunion company’ and ‘Nissan has never had a union’ and stuff like that, practically telling us that Nissan doesn’t allow unions. It’s like they wanted to put the fear of God in you from day one.”\n\nOther reported tactics include screening anti-union television shows, produced by Nissan management, on monitors throughout the plant, in break rooms and work areas. “They don’t just show it once at the start of your shift,” Pat Ruffin, a quality technician, explained in the NAACP report. “They put the film on a continuous loop and show it all day long, so it’s in your face whenever you look up at the screen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:33:12.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
