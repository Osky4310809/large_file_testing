Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIllegal football streams and pirated films and music will be harder to find in internet searches under a crackdown. \nGoogle and Bing have agreed a code of conduct that means pirate sites, that can put usersâ€™ security at risk, are demoted in search results \nThe code, the first of its kind in the UK, will accelerate the demotion of illegal sites following notices from rights holders. \nIt means those who search for content such as music videos, digital books and football coverage will more likely to be taken to bona fide providers rather than pirate sites where a user's security may be at risk. \nEddy Leviten, director general at the Alliance for Intellectual Property, said: \"Sometimes people will search for something and they will end up unwittingly being taken to a pirated piece of content. \n\"What we want to ensure is that the results at the top of the search engines are the genuine ones. \n\"It is about protecting people who use the internet, but also protecting the creators of that material too. \n\"You go into schools and speak to children and many will say they want to be on YouTube, to be a personality on there. \n\"When you explain to them that they need to protect their ideas, their content, from being stolen or pirated, they understand.\" \nThe Intellectual Property Office (IPO) led the discussions to create the code, with the assistance of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).

These include court ordered site blocking, work with brands to reduce advertising on illegal sites and the Get it Right From A Genuine Site consumer education campaign, which encourages fans to value the creative process and directs them to legal sources of content. \nMr Leviten said: \"The alliance has been present throughout the discussions and has consistently made the case for a collaborative process that works for all rights holders and creators and starts to help the UK's intellectual property generators to promote and sell their works without unfair competition. \n\"While there is still a lot of work ahead, I would like to thank ministers, past and present, and officials at the IPO, DCMS and Ofcom for their help in getting us to this crucial stage.\" Read More The end of Pirate Bay?
