So far, it looks like only a small group of iOS users have received either version of the update.\nWhy is Facebook fussing over its comments so much lately? The tweaks could be part of the social network's's push to make users more, well, social. Facebook wants to increase user sharing and engagement network wide, which might also be the inspiration for all the Snapchat features that have come to the 'Book and its related apps in recent months.\nFacebook is betting users will be more likely to follow through with replies to their friends if comments are more like conversations on every platform — which means they'll spend more time on the site, driving even more revenue.\nWe reached out to Facebook for comment on the updates to see if this is a new feature definitely coming soon to all users or just limited tests of potential new UIs. We haven't received a response yet, but we'll update this article when we do.\nWATCH: Facebook stalkers confess their dark secrets", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Herbie", "https://t.co/2zXQxQKXF5", "https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/843896908745773057", "https://twitter.com/chrisZsnow/status/843541060903026688", "https://t.co/giirtKKHgv", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/fcwG4FC7.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/fcwG4FC7.jpg", "https://twitter.com/facebook"], "published": "2017-03-21T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:34:25.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
