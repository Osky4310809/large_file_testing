Canada has taken in some 40,000 refugees from Syria under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been a vocal advocate for asylum seekers.\nThe country’s parliament passed a resolution late last year concluding that the persecution of Yezidis, a Kurdish-speaking minority predominantly in Iraq, amounted to genocide . ISIS views Yezidis as heretics, and the group has been subjected to a brutal campaign of sexual and other forms of abuse.\n[ AFP ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:10:57.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
