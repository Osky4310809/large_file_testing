It's so nice to meet you!,\" Jolie said to the boys, hugging them, while the father encouraged them to say thank you.\n\n\nWhat happened next only served to excite them even more: not only did Jolie buy the big teddy bear, she gave both of the boys $50 each.\nTim explains they were only hoping for $40 - not $100.\n\"What a nice lady,\" remarked the happy Dad.\n\nMany on social media praised Jolie for the act, although few were unsurprised.\n\"Not surprised to hear that she did this for these sweet boys,\" wrote on user on LittleThings.com's Facebook page. \"She has a big heart for children but boy want they have a great story to tell their children someday. I'm happy that she decided to stop by and make these boys day so sweet of her to do so.\"\nSources:  LittleThings.com ,  RDS/YouTube  and  Facebook/Little Things /Photo Credit:  Georges Biard via Wikimedia Commons \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:53:20.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
