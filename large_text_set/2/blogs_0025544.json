I also think it’s politics. That’s the way it is,” Trump replied.

You’re possibly right but you never know. But I think President Obama’s behind it, because his people are certainly behind it,” Trump continued. \n“And some of the leaks possibly come from that group. You know, some of the leaks, which are really very serious leaks, because they’re very bad in terms of national security, but I also understand that’s politics. And in terms of him being behind things, that’s politics, and it will probably continue,” he added.   \nEarlier in February, Trump called the leaks a “ disgrace ” and a “very dangerous thing for this country.” \nDuring the interview, Trump noted that he may seek the source of the leaks in a different way than White House press secretary Sean Spicer , who over the weekend checked staffer’s phones in an attempt to crack down on leaks. \n“I would’ve handled it differently than Sean, but Sean handles it his way and I’m OK with it,” Trump said, noting he would have sat down one-on-one with staffers. \nTrump, who did not watch the Academy Awards because it conflicted with the White House’s Governors Ball, commented on the frequent attacks he received from attendees during the event.

I’ve watched it for years. I watched it against Ronald Reagan, I’ve watched it against so many other people,” he said. \n“And they always like pulling out the race card. In fact I did much better than many other than other Republicans in the last election. I did much better with Hispanics, I did much better with African-Americans, if I didn’t do better, I wouldn’t be sitting here,” he added. \nTrump noted that with all of the fake news coverage, he would not attend the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. \n“Over the years you make a mistake, I fully understand when they hit you. But when they make stories up, when they create sources, cause I believe that sometimes they don’t have sources, you know, the sources don’t exist, sometimes they do exist, I’m not saying all sources, but I do believe that a lot of the sources are made up. A lot of the stories are made up,” Trump said. \n“I believe a lot of, the stories are pure fiction, they just pull it out of air. Now, with all of that being said, I just thought it would be better if I didn’t do the dinner, that doesn’t mean I’m not going to do it next year but I just thought it would be better if I didn’t do it this year,” he added.
