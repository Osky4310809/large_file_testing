(Responding to a complaint, city officials closed the arts space days after a fire in an Oakland, Calif., building used for art studios killed 36 people. Some Bell Foundry tenants had been living at the artist workspace illegally, according to city officials.) \nOn Thursday, a fire inspector walked through and approved BROS' first-floor space for rehearsal use again, Baltimore Fire Department spokeswoman Blair Adams confirmed in an email Tuesday. Baltimore Housing acting commissioner Michael Braverman said in an email his agency approved a use and occupancy permit on the Bell Foundry's first floor. (The second floor and basement are still not permitted for use, Adams wrote.) \nKeating said the biggest hurdle to re-entering the space was proving to the city that squatters would not return to the building. The second floor, where some artists lived before the shuttering, is now empty, he said. The basement, which previously held music performances illegally, is now a space used only for storage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:30:29.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
