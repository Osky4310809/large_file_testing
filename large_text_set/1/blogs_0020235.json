Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFilm companies are constantly trying to market their films in new, interesting ways . And it's fair to say that Paramount Pictures succeeded with a prank to mark The Ring's latest instalment, Rings. \nIn footage uploaded to Facebook on Tuesday, customers in a TV showroom are tricked into believing that the film's villain, Samara, is crawling out of their television sets. \nThe 30-second clip - entitled 'Thereâ€™s no escape from Samara' - has already been viewed more than one million times and has gone viral, with thousands of petrified viewers left triggered by the joke. \nIt begins with a shop assistant testing the various features of devices on a wall, with potential buyers expressing mild interest in return at the demonstration. Film fans scream in horror as they're pranked (Photo: Facebook/ringsmovieuk) Samara is seen emerging from a flat-screen TV (Photo: Facebook/ringsmovieuk) The unsuspecting guests had no idea who was behind them... (Photo: Facebook/ringsmovieuk) The unknown actress certainly embodied the film's character with aplomb (Photo: Facebook/ringsmovieuk) \nIt's only when he claims to amp the settings up even further, that the raven-haired character is seemingly brought to life and crawls through the screen. \nNaturally, the reactions are priceless - with people screaming, crying and running away in fear. \nAt one point a man can he heard telling Samara to \"chill\", while another runs away so quickly that he falls to the floor. Hilariously, one dozy woman doesn't even notice the ghoul's presence until it touches her side - and, even then, it takes a while. \nOne young woman seems genuinely petrified as she shakes in the monster's presence, while another runs into a stack of cardboard boxes. \nNaturally, fans have been quick to respond on social media. One wrote: \"Seriously, I would freak if this happened!\" while another added: \"I swear to God if I was there I would've smacked her so hard out of panic. She creeps me out so much ahahah\". The grisly ghoul was seemingly brought to life in the prank (Photo: Facebook/ringsmovieuk) One bewildered woman seemed oblivious (Photo: Facebook/ringsmovieuk) The adults run away screaming from the TV showroom (Photo: Facebook/ringsmovieuk) \nA third chimed in: \"Definitely scream my lungs out. Can't believe no one else attacked her, TBH\". \nReleased in the UK on 3 February, Rings tells the tale of a woman called Julia who becomes worried about her boyfriend, Holt, after he explores the dark urban legend of a mysterious video said to kill the watcher seven days after viewing. \nShe sacrifices herself to save her boyfriend and in doing so makes a horrifying discovery: there is a \"movie within the movie\" that no one has ever seen before. One young woman was literally shaking at the elaborate practical joke (Photo: Facebook/ringsmovieuk) The film fan seems genuinely fearful as she makes a swift exit...
