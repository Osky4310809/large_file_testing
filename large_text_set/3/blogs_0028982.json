The teenager’s diary reportedly contained plans on how she would do a shooting at her school. FREDERICK COUNTRY SHERIFF’S OFFICE FACEBOOK PAGE \nWASHINGTON, United States — Police in Maryland have arrested an 18-year-old student who was planning a shooting at her school, after her family turned her in. \nFrederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said Tuesday that Nichole Cevario had amassed firearms and potential explosives materials, as well as instructions to make a homemade bomb. \nCevario will now face charges of possession of explosive and incendiary material intended to create a destructive device. ADVERTISEMENT \nAfter being arrested Thursday, the suspect was undergoing psychiatric evaluations at a local hospital near Thurmont, about an hour outside Washington. \nIf released, she would be held until arraignment. \nShe planned the attack on Catoctin High School for April 5, police said. \nThe plot was derailed when Cevario’s father noticed worrisome comments in her diary. \n“This event was very probably prevented by the parents who stepped forward,” Jenkins told reporters. \n“They saw something, they said something, they came forward. They did the right thing, so I give all the credit in the world to the parents of this young lady.” CBB", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T08:17:30.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
