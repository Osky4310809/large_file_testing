Not a very good one, way too dramatic. \n“Such blatant cheating with this hand on the throat, look of agony, bullshit! \n“This is football porn. Kids should not be allowed to watch.” \nWhile he was no too enamoured with Suarez’s exploits against PSG, Cantona was impressed by Barca as a collective, with Neymar in particular proving to be a shining light for the La Liga giants. \nHe added: “For some, it was a miracle on grass. \nNeymar: PSG comeback meant the most \n“For others it was the heist of the century. Either way, it was epic. \n“There were only 12 people on the field who actually believed in the possibility of Barca qualifying: Neymar...and the 11 players of Paris.” \nBarcelona’s reward for edging out PSG is a quarter-final showdown with Italian champions Juventus, with the two-legged contest set to pitch the 2015 finalists into direct competition once again.
