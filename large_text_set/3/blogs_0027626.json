If you’re like most, you could probably use some help in this area. Your memory holds a record of your entire life and helps shape your identity, but the ability to form memories does not occur until around the age of five . \nIn the video above, two-time world memory champion Alex Mullen and fellow medical student Cathy Chen explain a memorization system called Memory Palace, also known as Method of Loci, 1 which can help you improve your short-term recall. \nThe process involves using a space or location you’re familiar with to memorize unfamiliar or new things. The reason it works so well is because most people have very good spatial and visual memory. \nAs noted by Chen, “Visualizing an image makes it way more memorable and interesting to your brain than, say, random names or numbers.” \nAs an example, Chen and Mullen explain how you might memorize items on your grocery shopping list. You probably know your dining room really well, so to memorize “eggs” on your list, mentally travel into your dining room, look at a bowl of, say, fruit, and imagine a hen has laid eggs in your fruit bowl. \nThen, when you’re in the store, you can mentally travel around the space (your dining room), recall the bowl of fruit — and the funny image of eggs laid in the bowl. Another example: Imagine toothpaste smeared all over your placemats. When you recall the placemats, you automatically remember the item on your list, namely the toothpaste. You Too Can Become a Memory Master \nAccording to recent research, 2 , 3 , 4 anyone can become a memory master by training their brain using these kinds of techniques. In fact, people who had never used memory techniques prior to the study were able to master it, and in just six weeks, their brains began resembling those of the world’s top-ranked memory masters. \nThe study also confirmed what Chen and Mullen say — that the memory centers in memory masters’ brains communicate very strongly with their visual and spatial centers, and this appears to be a key to their impressive feats of memorization. As noted by CNN: 5 \n“[Researcher Boris Nikolai] Konrad said this is because of how memory athletes train: by picturing familiar places and filling them with imaginary objects, like a cow eating moss to represent the city of Moscow.” \nEssentially, what you’re doing is improving and expanding the connectivity between different centers in your brain. You’re not altering the actual structure. \nCompared to using a technique like Memory Palace, memory training involving repetition showed only minor gains in recall. They also didn’t improve the connectivity in their brain, which was evaluated using brain scans.

As reported in the Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services: 9 \n“Chess and bridge are leisure activities that demand working memory and reasoning skills. Older adults who play bridge score higher on working memory and reasoning measures compared to non-players and working crossword puzzles has also been associated with maintained cognition in older adults.” \nOther helpful pastimes include the following: \n• Learn a new language . Language lessons have been shown to provide a beneficial brain workout and increase neuronal connections 10 \n• Meditate . While it may seem you’re not doing much of anything in terms of challenging your brain when meditating, research shows it alters the structure of your brain for the better and has a number of neurological benefits, including improved attention and concentration 11 \n• Listen to Mozart . It’s long been theorized that listening to music may boost your brainpower ; you’ve probably heard of the “Mozart Effect,” which suggests listening to classical music can help make you smarter. \nIndeed, research 12 shows people who listen to Mozart’s classical music have an increase in brain wave activity linked to memory, understanding and problem solving. Interestingly, music composed by Beethoven showed no such effect. \nAccording to the researchers: 13 “These results may be representative of the fact that Mozart’s music is able to “activate” neuronal cortical circuits (circuits of nerve cells in the brain) related to attentive and cognitive functions” \n• Sniff rosemary oil. Engaging your olfactory senses may also have an effect on memory. Smells get routed through your olfactory bulb, the smell-analyzing region in your brain, which is closely connected to your amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions that handle memory and emotion. \nOne study 14 found people who sniffed rosemary essential oil performed better on memory tasks than those who did not. The aroma of peppermint has also been shown to enhance memory and increase alertness. \nIndeed, research shows that odors are especially effective as reminders of past experience, much more so than cues from other senses, such as sights or sounds 15", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T07:38:57.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
