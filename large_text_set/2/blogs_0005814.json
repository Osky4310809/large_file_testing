The suit, which is currently being heard in the ninth circuit federal court in San Francisco, California, has already succeeded in imposing a temporary halt to the enforcement of Trump’s executive order. \nWhile SpaceX and Tesla were not signatories of the original version of the amicus brief, a Tesla spokesperson told the Verge that “as soon as we saw the brief this morning, we insisted on being added”. Previously, Musk had argued that he would use his membership of Donald Trump’s advisory forum to “express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration”. \nAlong with Tesla and SpaceX, 29 other companies also joined the brief , including Adobe, HP, Bungie, and Slack. Separately, companies including Groupon and Pivotal software have filed their own letters supporting the amicus brief . \nAnother amicus brief, supporting the migrant ban , was filed by a collection of right-wing organisations, including the English First Foundation, Gun Owners of America, Citizens United and the Conservative Legal Defence and Education Fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:58:48.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
