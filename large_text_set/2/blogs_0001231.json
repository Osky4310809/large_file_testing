No suelo responder a los rumores pero en este caso involucran a mi familia y no puedo ni quiero pasarlos por alto. — Sergio Kun Aguero (@aguerosergiokun) 2 de febrero de 2017 Las versiones periodísticas que circulan son falsas. Mis abuelos paternos lamentablemente ya fallecieron y los maternos viven en Tucumán. — Sergio Kun Aguero (@aguerosergiokun) 2 de febrero de 2017 \n\"I do not usually respond to rumours but in this case my family is involved and I cannot, will not let this go,\" the striker wrote on the social network. \n\"The media stories that are circulating are false.
