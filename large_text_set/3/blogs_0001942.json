Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJose Mourinho believes Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be at Manchester United next season – and sees him as crucial to their continued revival. \nIbrahimovic has the option to extend his contract with United by another year, but has yet to commit himself to the Reds for another season. \nAlthough Ibrahimovic is 35, he has already scored 26 goals and Mourinho believes he can help United’s group of rising stars become world-class talents under his guidance. \n“I see Zlatan staying with us because that was the initial agreement – for him to come for one year plus us to have the option for a second,” said Mourinho. Ibrahimovic scored twice at Wembley last weekend (Photo: PA) \n“So I see him staying. This team has a lot to grow up, and the next transfer window will bring the team to a different level, because we’re going to try and bring a few players. \n“So I think Zlatan will be fundamental in the second year of this team and I think he’s willing to stay. \n“My feeling is that he’s really proud of himself, he’s happy with the success of his situation, so I see him staying.” \nMourinho feels youngsters like Marcus Rashford, Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw can take their game to a new level by continuing to work alongside Ibrahimovic. \nIbrahimovic is renowned for his discipline and professionalism, particularly with regard to his fitness, a trait Mourinho is hoping will rub off on his younger players, especially Shaw.
