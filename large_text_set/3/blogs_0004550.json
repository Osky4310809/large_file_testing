AG Jeff Sessions recuses himself from any current and future investigations into Russia ties to the Trump campaign https://t.co/gFFsmQuriP \n— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) March 2, 2017 \nSessions argued his answers to Congress were “honest and correct” about his meeting with the Russian Ambassador, but said he would further explain himself in a letter to Senators. \n“I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,” the Attorney General said at the outset of his news conference. \nOn Capitol Hill, Sessions had endured a full day of slings and arrows about his answers at his confirmation hearings, where he said, “I did not have communications with the Russians.” \n“My reply to Senator Franken was honest and correct, as I understood it at the time,” Sessions explained. \nSome Republicans argued that Sessions did not mislead the Senate Judiciary Committee – but Democrats pointed to a written answer that he gave to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), in which he flatly denied any contacts at all. \nThe announcement that Sessions would not be involved in any Russia probe did not satisfy his critics, who wanted more. \n“Attorney General Sessions’ narrow recusal and his sorry attempt to explain away his perjury are totally inadequate,” said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. \n“He must resign immediately,” Pelosi said flatly. \nOther Democrats also wanted more. \n“Recusal is not enough,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). “Special Counsel at the bare minimum.” \n“Special prosecutor needed, as well as Independent Commission to investigate Russia ties,” added Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR). \nAsked what he and the Russian Ambassador had discussed, Sessions said it was a lively discussion at times.
