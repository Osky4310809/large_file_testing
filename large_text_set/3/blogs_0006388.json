Comparing me now to that 18 year old girl then is apples n oranges. I can give a f--k about meeting standards and impressing people.\" \nAfter marrying her now-husband Hank Baskett at the Playboy Mansion in 2009, Kendra went on to star in her own self-titled reality show and give birth to a son and daughter, ages 7 and 2-years-old. Photos \nStars Who Posed Nude for Playboy Paul Fenton/ZUMA \nThe 31-year-old went on, \"Who I am is who I am n the people who follow my journey know what's up n I love you guys. Got a lot coming up n can't wait to share it with all of you. \" \nKendra has never shied away from discussing her experience with Playboy publicly, and in an exclusive interview with E! News last October, she reminisced about the most positive aspects it afforded her. \n\"You know what my favorite part of living there was? Hef. At first, it wasn't. I moved into the Playboy Mansion at 18 years old. I went in for the party, but I left with a best friend,\" Kendra told us. Aww ! \nAs for those future projects Kendra can't wait to reveal, guess we'll have to wait and see!
