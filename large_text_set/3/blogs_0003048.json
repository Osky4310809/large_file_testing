Good job monks he’ll be injured by week 6. snowdood163 says: Mar 7, 2017 7:55 AM \nImagine that, a moronic New England stool pigeon interjecting his loser opinion on a Broncos thread. Just worry about your own team renobinroxbury. jonathankrobinson424 says: Mar 7, 2017 7:56 AM \nI don’t get the mad rush to sign Romo. He’s one clean hit from separting his shoulder again. I don’t think he’ll last more than 5 games with whomever he signs for. Draft another QB and pickup a health jouneyman veteran.(McCown?) gixrider says: Mar 7, 2017 8:02 AM \nOf course, then it becomes a question of how far Jerry Jones is willing to go to do right by Romo. Houston has been mentioned as a possible trade partner, \nElway knows that Jerry would sell his soul to the devil before he would help Houston potentially advance in the playoffs. I think he would rather help a division rival than his state rival. Another NFC east team does well and he loses bragging rights…..Houston doing well potentially costs him in-state fan support which translates into money (gear purchases, etc.).
