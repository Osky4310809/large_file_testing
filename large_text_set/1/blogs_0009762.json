Earlier that evening she and her husband had been discussing their hopes and dreams for their new daughter, Dora — and Feinzaig jolted wide awake with an idea.\n“I imagined my daughter getting a letter that said, ‘Congratulations on being the founder and CEO of your own company!’” said Feinzaig, 37, of Seattle. “I decided I would build her a toy so that she could play 'entrepreneur' just like she will also play doctor, teacher, ballerina and scientist.”\nCourtesy of Mel Chaves Photography Leslie Feinzaig said her daughter Dora helped inspire her to dream up Venture Kits.

Launched last fall, the kits include game-like guides to entrepreneurism written for kids.\nNever miss a parenting story with TODAY’s newsletters!

More kits are coming soon, starting with Talent Show, a live entertainment business kit for kids age 8 to 12.\nCourtesy of Venture Kits, LLC The Venture Kits \"Treats To-Go\" line helps young kids start their own baking businesses. The kits retail in the $25 range, and they’ve been getting positive reviews from tiny CEOs.\nFlora Bradley, 11, of Seattle, asked for a Venture Kit as a gift over the holidays.\n“It seemed like a fun way to interact with my friends and make money,” she said. “I feel with other kits it might just give you a recipe, but (this) actually helps lead you to make a business that you will continue. It leads you to become an entrepreneur.”\nCourtesy of Venture Kits, LLC These kids are hoping to make some actual dough from their baked goods. It’s a nifty idea — but is it all that different from the lemonade-stand model, complete with a card table and hand-drawn sign? Feinzaig said there’s nothing wrong with lemonade stands; this approach just adds more structure to the experience.\n“This is the next step up,” Feinzaig told TODAY Parents. “Every invention, every discovery, every work of art, every new venture starts with an entrepreneur and an entrepreneurial spirit. Kids have a passion to learn and create.”\nRELATED: Lessons from a lemonade stand\nFeinzaig noted that the effort of starting a business flexes all parts of kids’ brains: it nurtures their creativity, challenges their problem-solving skills and promotes their communication and people skills.\nCourtesy of Venture Kits, LLC \"Kids have a passion to learn and create,\" said Venture Kits creator Leslie Feinzaig. More than anything else, she said, parents might be surprised to watch their budding entrepreneurs in action. Mom Elizabeth McQuillan sure was.\n“My 8-year-old just got off the phone after a 45-minute pricing interview with my mother-in-law, and has also recruited a girlfriend to do customer sourcing,” said McQuillan, who lives in Massachusetts. “We'll see how far she gets with this, but ... I’m loving this idea of plan first, do the math, then execute and review.\n“The suggestion to reinvest in the business with any profits was a great conversation starter. Over the summer I had to put a stop to the endless lemonade stands. Suggesting that she pay for the endless demand for supplies helped my cause!”\nKids also can get involved in picking, designing and testing new kits by joining Venture Kits’ Board of Kid Advisors , which has more than 100 members nationwide.\nFeinzaig, a native of Costa Rica, moved to the United States 11 years ago to get her MBA at Harvard University on a full-tuition scholarship. She stayed after earning her degree to get work experience on a visa. Now a permanent U.S. resident, Feinzaig is focused on building her Venture Kits business and helping kids learn entrepreneurial skills through what she calls “hands-on, screens-off play.”\nMeryl Schenker Photography \"As a woman, a mom, a Latina, an immigrant and an entrepreneur,\" Leslie Feinzaig said, \"I am more passionate and more committed than ever to fulfill my mission of making entrepreneurship accessible and fun.\" More Parenting Tips videos 3:54 How to set new rules for your kids (like less screen time) in 2017 5:35 Snow day activities to keep kids busy (and grown-ups sane) indoors 3:20 How to have the best New Year’s Eve ever… with kids 3:28 How to keep your kids from getting bored during holiday break “My goal is to inspire a whole generation of children to try entrepreneurship,” Feinzaig said, “so that when all those kids grow up, no matter their gender, creed, race, religion or sexuality, they can all have an equal chance at becoming tomorrow's leaders.”\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display Background Enhancements font\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans size\nT T T T color\nshare link Carry him while you can: One mom on the weight of motherhood Play Video - 0:49 Carry him while you can: One mom on the weight of motherhood Play Video - 0:49", "external_links": ["http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_02/1187438/kid-entrepeneurs-today-170111-tease-02_ca5ee76276094e9463c06092b2ad6fec.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/_pb4QcsGyyI?wmode=transparent", "http://www.venturekits.com/kids", "http://www.venturekits.com/", "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201612/tdy_klg_activities_161226.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_02/1187196/leslie_and_dora_-_courtesy_of_mel_chaves_photography_a8b0d6534dcb1015f983d8816627f7c5.today-inline-large.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201701/x_tdy_ORANGUTANPREGNANTWOMAN_170111_02.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/4hb1wiVCK6Zl&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:0,&quot;height&quot;:0,&quot;bitrate&quot;:0,&quot;duration&quot;:49,&quot;durationISO&quot;:&quot;PT48S&quot;,&quot;assetType&quot;:&quot;OnceURL&quot;}", "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_02/1187199/_mg_0715_b82d813320ecba51602dc665591e9ed6.today-inline-large.jpg", "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201611/x_tdy_tov_carry_him_161111.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201701/x_tdy_GABBY_SSCHOOL_BUS_170111.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201701/tdy_take_obama_170111__205886.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "http://www.venturekits.com/shop", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201701/2017-01-06T15-41-46-266Z--1280x720.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201701/tdy_take_activities_170106.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_02/1187200/leslie_feinzaig_headshot_-_copy_f7c5982b9d2e82e44d71db7bb3a2fa9f.today-inline-large.jpg", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_02/1187198/_mg_0773_bc0e32ae2698505cb786a815a44f9b4c.today-inline-large.jpg", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201701/x_tdy_DEAFDOGAUTISMBOY_160110.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201612/tdy_nye_tmb.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_02/1187197/product_front_treats_to-go_53f663dcc27b45bcbfe38f8f114dabde.today-inline-large.png"], "published": "2017-01-12T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:19:24.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
