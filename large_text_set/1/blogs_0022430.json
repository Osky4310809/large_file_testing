Celebrities such as Madonna, America Ferrera, Cher and Scarlett Johansson all participated in the historic event, the Huffington Post reported.\nWhile Swift did not show up at any of the marches, she did sent out a tweet in the support of the women who did. She wrote: So much love, pride, and respect for those who marched. I'm proud to be a woman today, and every day. #WomensMarch\nThe \"Bad Blood\" singer's tweet did not go over too well with social media users, with some people accusing her of using feminism as a marketing tool.\n“As a fan of yours, this is some bullsh*t,\" wrote one Twitter user. \"You do not get to pick and choose when feminism benefits you.\"\n\"Stop using feminism as a prop to fuel your fake girl power narrative/meticulously crafted PR persona,\" wrote another.\n\"F**k you. you stayed quiet all through the election process to ensure your record sales wouldn't fall victim to a divided USA,\" another user observed.\nSome Taylor Swift fans came to the singer's defense.\n\"And it would drag attention to Taylor instead of the cause,\" one user tweeted. \"And that’s why she decided to don’t go.\"\n\"You have to understand that she does not have to prove anything to anyone, leave her alone,\" another user wrote.\n\"Taylor doesn't speak: gets hate… taylor speaks: gets hate… give the girl a f*cking break,\" wrote another.\nStill, others were convinced the pop singer could have used her celebrity for good.\n\"No one said it was her job, but in a position of influence you have a moral obligation to stand against hate,\" wrote one Twitter user.\n\nTaylor Swift previously told Time Magazine during a 2012 interview that she prefers to keep her politics private.\n“I don’t talk about politics because it might influence other people,\" she told the magazine. \"And I don’t think that I know enough yet in life to be telling people who to vote for.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T16:07:31.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
