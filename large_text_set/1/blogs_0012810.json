Shirley Randleman, R-Wilkes, when she was in the House and committee assistant. \nUnder Weeks, White served as House voting clerk and then administrative clerk. \nWhite must be elected Wednesday by a majority vote of the chamber. But House Rules Chairman David Lewis says White is the only known nominee so far, and he has the backing of both the Republican and the Democratic caucuses. \n\"He's kind of been Denise Weeks' chief deputy for these many years,\" said Lewis, R-Harnett. \nAn Oregon native, White has spent the majority of his life in North Carolina, earning a bachelor's degree in political science at St. Andrews University in Laurinburg.
