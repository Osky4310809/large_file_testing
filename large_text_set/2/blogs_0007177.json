He was 71.\nFans of sci-fi likely know Hatch from his portrayal of Captain Apollo in the original Battlestar Galactica series, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination in 1979. When the series was reimagined on Syfy in 2003, Hatch returned in the role of Tom Zarek.\nPrior to Battlestar Galactica , the actor appeared in television shows including All My Children and Hawaii Five-O . He had a special fondness for the Battlestar universe, though, writing five novels based on the series and its characters.\nHatch died at his home in Santa Clarita, CA, with his son Paul by his side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:44:59.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
