Lance Bass appeared on Entertainment Tonight , where he announced that *NSYNC will be re-releasing some music later this year. \n“I don’t know if I can announce it yet,” he said before revealing, “We are coming out with a really cool vinyl edition of our Christmas album, because it’s coming up on 20 years of that album.” Has it been? We feel old. \nThey’re also getting their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this year, and he confirmed, “We’ll all be there.” While groups like New Kids on the Block, the Spice Girls, and the Backstreet Boys have all reunited over the years and gone on tour, we haven’t seen much of *NSYNC all together since the band broke up. \nBut, even though we haven’t seen much of them, Bass said that the group still keeps in touch. “We talk daily,” he said. But as far as what they talk about, his lips are sealed. “I would have to shoot you,” he said. \nThey won’t be releasing any new music, but this is *NSYNC we’re talking about. We’ll take what we can get. \n[image via Featureflash Photo Agency / Shutterstock, Inc.] \nHave a tip we should know?
