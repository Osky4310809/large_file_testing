By Tom Phillips Published 23/02/2017 \nMass Effect Andromeda has largely avoided replicating the big-name voice cast of the series' original trilogy - until today, as BioWare has revealed Game of Thrones' Natalie Dormer as one of your new crew. \nDormer plays doctor Lexi T'Perro, an asari medic you meet right after waking from cryosleep and who then later joins you as your permanent medical officer on board the Tempest (your new Normandy ship). \nLexi is your new Dr. Chakwas, in other words, although like everyone on the Tempest has a lot more interaction. In one section I played Lexi - a fairly traditional asari - was having a disagreement with your more rebellious asari squadmate Peebee. \nBioWare's fresh character trailer for Lexi mentions her rivalry with Peebee and reveals her crush on a certain krogan squad member of yours: \nAndromeda's other cast of characters are voiced by regulars in the video game voice acting world, but few other names (save for Clancy Brown as your dad) will likely be known to players. \nFor much more on the game, our huge Mass Effect Andromeda hands-on preview just went live.
