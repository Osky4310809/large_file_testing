But regardless of the outcome, two former Alabama players will walk out of NRG Stadium as world champions later this evening. \nFor New England, linebacker Dont'a Hightower will try to win his second Super Bowl ring in his fifth season with the Patriots (XLIX). The Pro Bowl linebacker ranks fourth on the team in total tackles with 65 as New England’s defense’s signal caller. \nHis teammate, rookie corner Cyrus Jones will try to earn his first, although he could find himself on the inactive list Sunday. Regardless, Jones could accomplish a rare feat of winning a national championship and Super Bowl in back-to-back seasons. \nFor Atlanta, All-Pro receiver Julio Jones will look to bring his new city its first Super Bowl title and second world championship. This season, he caught 98 passes for 1,656 yards and nine touchdowns, despite missing two games. Jones and Falcons’ quarterback Matt Ryan will look to overpower Hightower and the Patriots’ defense with the NFL’s top offensive attack. \nJust like Hightower, Atlanta linebacker Courtney Upshaw is looking to claim the second Super Bowl win of his career. He also won a title as a member of the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII, achieving Jones’ goal of winning a national championship and Super Bowl in consecutive years.

But before the final game of the 2016-17 season begins, let’s take a trip down memory lane to recall some of the best former Alabama player performances on Super Sunday. (Photo: Focus On Sport, Getty) \n*** Honorable mention: Cornelius Bennett, Super Bowl XXV-XXVII and XXXIII \nBennett never won a Super Bowl in his 14-year career, but the former Tide linebacker played in five championships during his pro tenure and is one of only seven players to play in five Super Bowls. Bennett made four-straight appearances with the Buffalo Bills (XXV, XXVI, XXVII and XXVIII) and one with the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII against the Denver Broncos. \n5. Dont'a Hightower. Super Bowl XLIX \nHightower helped New England win its fourth Super Bowl and made one of the most important tackles of the team’s season, just before the play that shocked the world. Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch appeared to find a hole for an easy score with 1:06 to play, but Hightower stopped the back just shy of the goal line. One play later, Malcolm Butler picked off a pass to seal the game. The former Crimson Tide team captain did this a torn labrum. \n4. Lee Roy Jordan, Super Bowl VI \nJordan started at middle linebacker on the Dallas Cowboys’ defense for 14 seasons – and in Super Bowl VI. Dallas faced the Miami Dolphins in January of 1972, a year after losing to the Baltimore Colts. The former Alabama linebacker and the Cowboys’ defense, which was nicknamed the “Doomsday Defense,” were able to hold Miami’s offense to a field goal in the team’s 24-3 win. \n3. Ken Stabler, Super Bowl XI \nStabler was close to reaching the big game throughout his entire career, but he finally made an appearance in January of 1977. The former Crimson Tide quarterback was the starter for the Oakland Raiders as the team faced the Minnesota Vikings. The late Stabler threw for 180 yards and one touchdown to tight end Dave Casper on 12-of-19 passing. The Raiders defeated the Vikings 32-14 to claim the franchise’s first Super Bowl victory. \n2. Bart Starr, Super Bowl I and II \nStarr lined up under center for the Green Bay Packers in the first two Super Bowls and walked away victorious from both championship games. In Super Bowl I, against the Kansas City Chiefs, Starr threw for 250 yards and two touchdowns on 16-of-23 passing. In Super Bowl II, against the Oakland Raiders, the former Alabama quarterback threw for 202 yards and two scores on 13-of-24 passing. Starr was named MVP of both games. \n1. Joe Namath , Super Bowl III \nBefore the third Super Bowl even began, Namath guaranteed the AFL’s New York Jets would defeat the NFL’s Baltimore Colts. “We’re going to win Sunday, I guarantee it,” he said. And the former Crimson Tide gunslinger was true to his word, as the Jets won the game 16-7. Namath threw for 206 yards on 17-of-28 passing, with eight of his passes going to wide receiver George Sauer for 133 yards. Broadway Joe was named the game’s MVP. *** Subscribe to BamaOnLine: Buy 1 month, GET 2 MONTHS FREE *** Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:19:18.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
