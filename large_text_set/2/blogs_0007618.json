is sent off as Barcelona edge into the Copa del Rey final, Neuer’s heroics takes Bayern Munich to the German Cip final, and PSG’s controversial late winner. \nCatch up on all the overseas action in EuroBeat! \nLuis Suarez booked Barcelona’s place in a fourth consecutive Copa del Rey final but was sent off as a bad-tempered 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday secured a 3-2 aggregate win. \nSuarez’s second goal of the tie looked to have put the semi-final beyond the visitors just before half-time. \nHowever, the Uruguayan was one of three players sent-off in a pulsating second-half and will miss May’s final against Alaves or Celta Vigo. \nKevin Gameiro set up a grandstand finish seven minutes from time moments after blazing a penalty over the bar. \nBut Barca saw out five minutes of stoppage time with nine men after Suarez’s first red card for the club. \n“It makes me laugh because it was like he (the referee) wanted to do it,” an angry Suarez told Gol Television. media_camera Barcelona's Luis Suarez celebrates after scoring. \n“We need to see if we can appeal the second yellow because it isn’t even a foul, but we already know how these things go.” Atletico needed a first win at the Camp Nou since 2006 to have any chance of overturning a 2-1 first leg deficit inflicted by stunning goals from Suarez and Lionel Messi. \nYet, a fine performance in which they pushed Barcelona all the way gave Atletico boss Diego Simeone hope they can recapture during the rest of the campaign the form that took them to the Champions League final last season. \n“We are out of the competition but have our heads held high and the strength that we have three fantastic months (ahead),” said Simeone. \n“Hopefully we can maintain what we showed against them in the second-half the other day and during the 90 minutes today.” media_camera Suarez (R) argues with referee after being shown the red card. \nAtletico nearly secured the perfect start with a lightning counter-attack from a Barca corner that ended with Yannick Carrasco stinging the palms of Jasper Cillessen. \nHowever, the visitor’s intense early pressing eased as the half wore on and Barca went in front just before half-time thanks to more magic from Messi and Suarez. \nMessi sucked in the Atletico defence and when his effort from the edge of the area was parried by Miguel Angel Moya, Suarez gobbled up the rebound for his 23rd goal of the season. \nAtletico were dealt an injury blow at the start of the second period as Diego Godin had to be replaced by Lucas Hernandez just five days after the French defender was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. \nHowever, Simeone’s men were given a glimmer of hope just before the hour mark when Sergi Roberto dived in on Filipe Luis and was deservedly shown a second yellow card. \nThat hope should have been bolstered moments later when Antoine Griezmann smashed the ball inside Cillessen’s far post, but was wrongly flagged offside. media_camera Barcelona's Andre Gomes (R) runs with the ball chased by Atletico's Antoine Griezmann. \nBarca’s nerves were eased when Atletico were also reduced to 10 men 21 minutes from time when a slip from Carrasco saw him wipe out Arda Turan, the Belgian also being shown a second yellow card. \nMessi’s incredible run of scoring free-kicks in 2017 nearly continued with a driven effort from fully 35 yards that came crashing back off the bar. \nAtletico were given a lifeline when Gerard Pique was adjudged to have tripped Gameiro inside the area with 10 minutes remaining. \nGriezmann had missed his fifth penalty in seven attempts at the weekend and handed over responsibility to his compatriot, but Gameiro blazed over. \nJust three minutes later, though, the two combined to great effect as Griezmann’s decision to cross rather than shoot caught the Barca defence off guard and Gameiro rolled into an empty net. \nAtletico then pilled on the pressure in search of a winning goal on the night to send the game into extra time. \nSuarez was the third player to be shown a second yellow for a stray elbow on Koke. \nBut a great block from Samuel Umtiti to divert Luis’s goalbound drive preserved Barca’s incredible record of not having lost a tie to anyone other than Real Madrid in the Cup sine 2010. media_camera Barcelona's Lionel Messi (C). \nNEUER’S HEROICS PUT BAYERN INTO CUP QUARTERS \nHolders Bayern Munich squeezed into the quarter-finals of the German Cup with a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg on Tuesday following Douglas Costa’s first-half strike and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer’s heroics. \nBayern were coasting at Munich’s Allianz Arena after a well-taken goal from Costa on 17 minutes, but it took two superb saves from Germany shotstopper Neuer to put the Bavarian giants through. \nWolfsburg, who are struggling in the Bundesliga, upped the pace for the final ten minutes as Bayern lost their shape at the back. \nAttacking midfielder Yunus Malli, a new signing last month from Mainz, forced Neuer into spectacular parries in quick succession as Carlo Ancelotti’s Bayern endured a tense final few minutes. \nCosta’s goal was a boost for Bayern amidst reports the Selecao forward is considering leaving the German giants to further his career at the end of the season. media_camera Bayern's Douglas Costa, background, celebrates with team mate David Alaba after scoring. \nAnd according to another report in magazine Sport Bild, Bayern captain Philipp Lahm has decided to retire in June despite having a year left on his contract. \nElsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach won their third round match 2-0 at second-division Greuther Fuerth thanks to goals by Oscar Wendt and a penalty from Thorgan Hazard, brother of Chelsea star Eden. \nGladbach’s cause was helped when Fuerth’s Hungary international midfielder Adam Pinter was sent off with just 19 minutes gone for a dangerous tackle on Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer. \nHamburg, who are in the Bundesliga’s relegation places, brushed off poor league form, winning 2-0 at home to Cologne with goals by Gideon Jung and US striker Bobby Wood. \nSecond division Arminia Bielefeld are into the last eight after a scare against fourth division minnows Astoria Walldorf, progressing 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw. \nIn the plum pick of Wednesday’s matches, Borussia Dortmund host Hertha Berlin in an all Bundesliga tie. \nCONTROVERSIAL LATE WINNER RESCUES PSG \nLucas grabbed a controversial late winner as Paris Saint-Germain beat Lille 2-1 on Tuesday to stay three points behind Monaco after the Ligue 1 leaders secured a gritty 2-1 victory at Montpellier. \nEdinson Cavani netted his league-leading 23rd goal of the season to put the reigning champions ahead on 70 minutes at the Parc des Princes. media_camera Paris Saint-Germain's Brazilian midfielder Lucas Moura (3rd-L) celebrates. \nA dreadful mistake from Alphonse Areola allowed Nicolas de Preville to level with four minutes left, but Lucas claimed a crucial three points for PSG in stoppage time despite being in an offside position. \n“We never gave up despite conceding a goal just a few minutes from the end. We kept going and were able to get the winner,” Lucas told Canal+ Sport. \nLille boss Patrick Collot admitted to feeling “huge frustration” and called for video technology to help out referees in such situations. \n“That’s the vagaries of football and it will be until there is video to help the referees,” said Collot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:19:16.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
