Franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe have shown fans what can happen when a studio pulls together its resources, so it should not be surprising to know that other companies are looking into the idea. Over at 20th Century Fox, the studio has film rights to one of Marvel’s most popular franchises with The X-Men , and they will be bringing that world to the small screen with Legion .

No, if you ask showrunner Noah Hawley, Legion has to earn the right to have crossovers. \nSpeaking to Entertainment Weekly , Hawley was asked if Legion might adopt crossover elements, and this is what the higher-up had to say: \n“I’m firm believer the show has to stand on its own two feet. For a crossover to be possible we have to earn that right through the quality of our storytelling and hopefully our popularity. David’s origin story hasn’t changed, so we haven’t changed that connection to the X-Men universe.” \nSo, for all you fans who were hoping to see Patrick Steward wheel Professor Xavier onto the show, it may not happen. Well, yet, at least. \nLegion is the story of a troubled young man who may be more than human. It introduces the story of David Haller, who since he was a teenager, has struggled with mental illness. Diagnosed as schizophrenic, David has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years. But after a strange encounter with a fellow patient, he’s confronted with the possibility that the voices he hears and the visions he sees might be real. \nDan Stevens ( Downton Abbey ), Rachel Keller ( Fargo ), Jean Smart ( Fargo ), Aubrey Plaza ( Parks and Recreation ), Jeremie Harris ( A Walk Among the Tombstones ), Amber Midthunder ( Hell or High Water ), Katie Aselton ( The League ) and Bill Irwin ( Interstellar ) star in Legion . \nMore LEGION: New Legion Teaser Image / New Legion Trailer / Legion In X-Men Comic Books / Who Is Legion? / Jemaine Clement Joins Legion / Legion Producers Talk X-Men And Marvel Universe Connections / How Legion Could Fix X-Men Continuity (Photo: 20th Century Fox) \nNoah Hawley ( Fargo ) will serve as an Executive Producer along with Lauren Shuler Donner ( X-Men: Days of Future Past, Deadpool ), Bryan Singer ( X-Men: Apocalypse, Superman Returns ), Simon Kinberg ( X-Men: Days of Future Past, The Martian ), Jeph Loeb ( Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Marvel’s Daredevil, Marvel’s Jessica Jones ), Jim Chory ( Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Marvel’s Daredevil, Marvel’s Jessica Jones ) and John Cameron ( Fargo, The Big Lebowski ).
