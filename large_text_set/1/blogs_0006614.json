FOX SPORTS BARCELONA and Real Madrid are set to battle for Dele Alli, but he’s not the only Spurs man that the Catalan giant wants. \nCheck out the latest transfer links in Rumour Mill! \nBARCELONA V REAL FOR ALLI \nBarcelona are ready to vie with Real Madrid for Tottenham starlet Dele Alli, according to The Mirror. \nThe Spurs midfielder has quickly become one of the most sought after young players in football, and now the Catalan giant reportedly want him to join their superstar line-up. \nHowever, the 20-year-old, who’s scored seven goals in his last four games, is reportedly also being pursued by Barca’s arch-rival Real Madrid. \nBut for either side to capture his signature, they will need reportedly to pay at least 70 million pounds ($118m). \nIt would result in a great profit for Tottenham, who bought him for just five million pounds from MK Dons in early 2015.

Griezmann ends drought in win 0:37 \nPEP: CITY ‘EVALUATING’ BADSTUBER DEAL \nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola has admitted they could make a move for Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber. \nGuardiola believes his squad is short of defensive options, especially considering they will compete across three competitions in the second half of the season following a 5-0 thrashing of West Ham in the FA Cup third round. \nThe Spaniard insists there are no names on the table yet but he will hold talks with City’s director of football Txiki Begiristain in the coming days before deciding on their targets. \nHe said: “We are evaluating if there’s a chance to take one (defender). I know Holger, he’s a fantastic player, a fantastic guy, but he’s a Bayern Munich player, and we should first of all speak with them and with him. Holger Badstuber. Source: Supplied \n“Now, on the table, there are no names because we had a lot of games. But now we have 10 days until Everton, so we have time to discuss with Txiki, with the club, what is the best for the rest of the season. \n“We have to speak about the situation. When we arrive now in the Premier League, in the FA Cup, in the Champions League, if something happens with the injuries we don’t have enough. \n“We have Nico [Otamendi], John [Stones] and [Aleksandar] Kolarov. Kolarov is a full-back, and of course we have Tosin [Adarabioyo], but Tosin is still young. Hopefully Vincent [Kompany] can help us, but Vincent in the last two years he was like this [with injuries].” \nCONTE WANTS 10 YEARS AT TOP - JUST DON’T TELL HIS WIFE \nChelsea coach Antonio Conte wants to stay in top-flight management for at least another decade, but worries his wife might have other ideas. \nThe Italian, who has guided Chelsea to pole position in the Premier League, says the likes of Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and current Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger have set the benchmark for management. \n“You are talking about two monsters, two great managers,” Conte said.

I prefer that my wife (Elisabetta) doesn’t listen to this.”“But in the moment that football is not in our life, I think probably we die.” Chelsea, five points clear in the Premier League, play Peterborough in the FA Cup third round on Sunday looking to bounce back from seeing their 13-game winning run in the league come to an end on Wednesday at Tottenham \nBILIC HAS TWO GAMES LEFT \nSlaven Bilic’s career at West Ham could be coming to an end. \nWith the Hammers in 13th place and after their 5-0 FA Cup home defeat to Manchester City, the manager has two more games to save his job, according to The Sun.

Source: AFP \nBut Antalyaspor club chairman Ali Safak Ozturk said the club had decided to hold on to Eto’o. \n“Great targets are only achieved with great deeds and people,” he said, quoted by the Fanatik sports website. \n“There has been various gossip about a transfer for Eto’o. We talked to the good people of our city and decided not to sell our captain, whatever happens.” In a bizarre exchange with Eto’o at the club, he asked the player “Do you love Antalyaspor? Are you staying?” Eto’o replied “Yes” on both occasions, Fanatik said.
