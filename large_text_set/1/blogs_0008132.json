Called the \"Monkey Sign\" statue, this is only Banksy's third statue creation for the mass market. Working with Medicom Toy, the 14\" figure falls under the brand's \"BRANDALISM\" section and features a monkey wearing a sign that says \"DO NOTHING YOU'LL LIVE LONGER.\" The figure is constructed of resin, and was available at retailers such as TOYKIO for â‚¬599 EUR (approximately $630 USD). While it's sold out now, keep an eye out for this piece to pop up elsewhere. \nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:36:12.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
