A majority of Americans in every single congressional district in the country think we should set strict CO2 limits on coal-fired power plants—and yet, the New York Times notes , the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are hell-bent on unwinding rules that would stem greenhouse gases and harmful pollution (or, as Kentucky Senator Rand Paul spins it , “suffocating regulations on our hardworking miners and their families,”).

There are a ton of revelations here: on a national scale, 70 percent of Americans believe that global warming will harm future generations and 71 percent trust climate scientists about global warming. However, only 49 percent agree that “most scientists think global warming is happening,” appearing to demonstrate the effective dissemination of the false , industry-funded notion that the existence of climate change is still a matter up for legitimate debate.

The destruction of our habitat is not something people really like to chat about, which, while understandable, is also pretty scary. \nTo find out how your neighbors feel about climate change, check out the full study here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:40:51.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
