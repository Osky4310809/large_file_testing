Austin Westlake . All the chips were on the table with one swim to decide who would bring home the UIL Class 6A girls state championship at the Lee and Joe Jamail Texas Swim Center . \nEach team entered the 400-yard freestyle relay with 225 points, but it was the Lady Highlanders who prevailed, taking the gold medal with a new state-record time of 3:21.06. It was more than two seconds faster than the previous mark, ironically set by the Lady Chaparrals back in 2008. \nThe winning team was comprised of Lucie Nordmann, Emily Reese , Payton Neff and Lillian Nordmann . The Woodlands came away with 265 points, followed by Westlake (259) and Southlake Carroll (196). \nThe Woodlands came away with a runner-up finish last February behind Westlake. But this time around, the Lady Highlanders were the ones standing at the top of the podium with their seventh state championship trophy. \n\"They thought about that all year - getting runner-up last year,\" The Woodlands coach Kent Kirchner said. \"That was the only thing on these girls' minds from the time we left last year to coming back this year and winning it all. That was their motivating factor here today, and they did an awesome job.\" \nJunior Lucie Nordmann led the charge for The Woodlands, collecting four gold medals - two individually and two as part of the Lady Highlanders' relay teams. \nNordmann won her first individual gold of the day in the 50-yard freestyle, touching the wall at 22.69 seconds. She set a new state record in prelims on Friday with a time of 22.68. She also won the state title in the same event last year. \nNordmann reached the top of the podium once again by winning her third straight gold medal in the 100-yard backstroke later in the meet. She finished the race in 52.48 seconds to set another new state record. \n\"I'm just so proud of this team, and I wanted to do it for all the girls here at state,\" Nordmann said. \"It just takes working hard at practice and working on the little things, and then everything else will take care of itself once you arrive to the big meet.\" \nLillian Nordmann, a freshman, captured her first-ever state medal in the 200-yard freestyle, taking bronze with a time of 1:47.58. She also took bronze in the 100-yard butterfly later in the meet, finishing at 53.48 seconds. \nReese, a senior, reached the podium in the 100-yard butterfly, earning silver for the second consecutive year with a time of 53.35 seconds. \n\"It means so much, especially with Lilly, the little freshman, right behind me,\" Reese said. \"The team this year is incredible, and we're all doing it for each other. So it means so much to be able to stand up there [on the podium] with her.\" \nThe Lady Highlanders kicked off the meet in grand fashion, setting a new state record in the 200-yard medley relay with a time of 1:41.83. The team of Lucie Nordmann, Karsten Fields , Reese and Valerie Staffeldt topped the record of 1:42.04 they set on Friday morning in the prelims. \nThe Woodlands followed that up with a bronze in the 200-yard freestyle relay, as Lillian Nordmann, Staffeldt, Vivian Yu and Fields finished at 1:35.58. \nHIGHLANDERS FINISH THIRD \nThe Woodlands boys also captured a state banner by finishing third in the team standings with 159 points. They trailed only Southlake Carroll (327) and Westlake (226). \nThe Highlanders' 200-yard medley relay team of Alberto Gomez , Joshua Sorensen , Nolan Persyn and Alexander Merrill narrowly missed the podium with a fourth-place finish at 1:32.24. \nThat trend continued in the 200-yard freestyle relay, as the team of Hickman-Chow, Sorensen, Merrill and Persyn took fourth at 1:24.25. \nGomez barely missed winning a medal in the 200-yard IM, finishing in fourth place with a time of 1:49.21. He also finished fourth in the 100-yard backstroke at 48.70 seconds. \nDespite the close calls, the Highlanders finished strong and came away with a silver medal in the 400-yard freestyle relay with a time of 3:03.90. That team was comprised of Hickman-Chow, Persyn, Merrill and Gomez. \n\"They battled the whole day,\" Kirchner said. \"They were getting fourth place in the relays and not getting on the podium. But coming down to that last relay, getting on the podium with second place, they got what they deserved.\" \nSIMS TAKES GOLD \nMontgomery sophomore Kaitlynn Sims captured a gold medal in the 500-yard freestyle after finishing second last year. She touched the wall at 4:46.07. \n\"I was just really relaxed, swimming my own race and seeing what I could do and how fast I could go,\" Sims said. \"I was definitely motivated and more experienced having done it last year, and I just had more peace of mind.\" \nHOHERZ WINS SILVER \nOak Ridge senior diver Anton Hoherz ended his high school career by capturing a second consecutive silver medal in the 1-meter diving event. He finished with a score of 465.40. \n\"Today, I just gave it my all, and good things happened,\" Hoherz said. \"I'm really happy about how I performed. … It's been really fun, and this is a really good experience.\" \nCHAMPIONSHIP HEAT RESULTS \n1.
