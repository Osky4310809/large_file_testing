The snake had not. \n\"The pilot came, and said, 'Guys, we have some loose snake on the plane, but we don't know where it is,'\" Ms McConnaughy said on Tuesday. \nUnlike the film Snakes On A Plane, strarring Samuel L Jackson , this one wasn't venomous. Mostly, it was sleepy. Samuel L Jackson saves the day in Snakes on a Plane Credit: Rex \nA little boy, one of seven passengers on the Ravn Alaska commuter flight on Sunday from the Alaska village of Aniak to Anchorage, was climbing on his seat when he spotted the slumbering snake. It was lying partially covered by a duffel bag near the back of the plane. \n\"He said, 'Oh, Mom, look at this. What's that?'\" McConnaughy said. \"That's how we figured out there was a snake sleeping in the corner.\" \nThere was no panic, Ms McConnaughy said. Mostly people wanted to see the snake .

It spent the rest of the flight in an overhead storage bin, and the plane reached Anchorage on schedule. \nAnchorage television station KTVA first reported the incident. \nM s McConnaughy's photos show a pale snake about 4 to 5 feet long. She said it appeared to want only to go back to sleep.

After arriving in Aniak, he reported that his snake was missing and likely on the return trip to Anchorage. \nThe airline was thankful for the heads-up, Walsh said. However, it has specific requirements for carrying on reptiles. Ravn Alaska does not allow any large animal that's not a dog to be used as a service animal. \nMs McConnaughy said there are plenty of snakes where she grew up in the Russian Far East. However, there are no wild snakes in most of Alaska, and she's not crazy about them, she said. \n\"Here in Alaska, it's kind of weird,\" she said.
