Kate Middleton says that Princess Charlotte is in charge of the royal family, and we believe it.\nEveryone knows that Queen Elizabeth II is the leader of Great Britain, but who runs the royal family? Okay, again, it’s clearly the actual Queen. That being said, in the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s household , it’s all up to Charlotte.\nShe is the princess of England after all — so she totally deserves to run the family. According to People , Middleton had a little “mummy chat” and revealed who runs their house. Sure, Middleton is a fierce mother. And she can take charge. But she joked that her toddler actually controls her world .\nOn Thursday, after unveiling a war memorial, the publication revealed that the Duchess talked to a fellow parent about motherhood.\nDanny Martindale/WireImage/Getty Images The publication reported that Middleton spoke with Samantha Burge, wife of Warrant Officer Class 2 Chris Burge. Burge is a mother of two, as is the 35-year-old royal, so they have a lot in common.\nOnce the ceremony in honor of servicemen, women, and civilians who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was over, the two women talked about their kids.\n“She said that Charlotte is growing up really fast,” Burge told reporters via People . “She is the one in charge.” Samir Hussein/Samir Hussein/WireImage/Getty Images The women talked together during their “mummy chat” about how their young children “rule the roost.”\n\nThe Duchess also opened up about the relationship between the royal siblings.\n“[She said] they are both becoming really good friends, George and Charlotte,” Burge added. Just look at these two siblings…of course they are BFFs already.
