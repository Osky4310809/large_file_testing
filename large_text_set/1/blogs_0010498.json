The Red Bulls are also going to promote assistant coach Denis Hamlett to technical director. Sporting director Ali Curtis was seen on Wednesday at the MLS Combine, but declined to comment on the ongoing changes at the club. \nMarsch was noticably absent from the MLS combine this week, as he was in Europe negotiating his move. He will leave the Red Bulls to replace Oscar Garcia Junyent as Red Bull Salzburg manager, with Junyent finalizing a deal to manage La Liga side Malaga. MLS Soccer was the first to report on Wednesday that Marsch was in negotiations to manage Red Bull Salzburg. \nArmas takes over in what will be his first professional coaching job. He joined Marsch's coaching staff in 2015 after a stint as coach of the Adelphi University women's team. A highly regarded coaching prospect who sources tell Goal once turned down an opportunity to coach the Chicago Fire, Armas is the third Red Bulls coach in three years, with Marsch having replaced former New York boss Mike Petke in abrupt fashion following the 2014 MLS season. \nHamlett will join the Red Bulls' front office after a lengthy career as both an assistant coach and head coach in MLS. A former member of Bob Bradley's coaching staff with the Chicago Fire, Hamlett spent two seasons as head coach of the Fire, leading them to the playoffs each season, before being let go. He joined Marsch's coaching staff with the Montreal Impact before reuniting with him at the Red Bulls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:27:45.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
