The first test is this question: Does Donald Trump act on behalf of a foreign power, or does he act in the interests of a foreign power especially over our own interests,\" McMullin said. \n\"The clear answer to that is yes, and that is very alarming.\" \nWith Trump's loyalties answered for, McMullin, who got about.05% of the popular vote in last year's election, moved on to treason. \"The second… part of the test is, does Donald Trump act under the control of a foreign power, and that's something that's very hard to determine.

Last month, over Twitter, he said Trump was taking sides with \"America's greatest adversary\" — once again effectively accusing the president-elect of treason . \nAlso in December he said Trump is \"not a loyal American\" for suggesting Rex Tillerson, a former ExxonMobile head with business ties to Russia, for secretary of state. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:47:44.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
