Not to mention, the document is also meant to help prevent discrimination against those who are cross-dressers in the Philippines. So, why does Manny have a problem with this piece of potential legislation??\nRelated: YouTuber Gigi Gorgeous Opens Up About Her Girlfriend \nApparently, Pacquiao simply doesn't support Senate Bill 1271's mission to eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression. The controversial athlete turned politician noted: \n\"Even in the Bible, we read that the woman should wear women's [clothing]; and the man, for men's wear. That's what I believe.\"\nRidiculous. To make matters worse, the 38-year-old defended his opposition to the bill by claiming that cross-dressing could be used to \"commit fraud.\" Excuse, you???\nManny went on to site the murder of Jennifer Laude , who was killed in 2014 by U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton , as an example of this said \"fraud.\" According to the conservative sportsman, Pemberton's crime was downgraded to a homicide due to Miz Laude deceiving him. Yup, Pacquiao just victim-blamed a slain innocent.\nThankfully, several of Manny's peers have since defended that Laude's murder is proof why an anti-discrimination bill is a necessity. Sadly, this isn't the first time Pacquiao has spoken out against the LGBT community. In case you forgot, back in 2016, Manny called homosexuals worse than animals while on the campaign trail. While he's since apologized for the comment, he's remained an adamant opposer to same-sex marriage . Smh.\nHopefully, one day, Manny will realize he's on the wrong side of history .
