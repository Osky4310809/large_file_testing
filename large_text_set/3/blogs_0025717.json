Brie Larson is playing the first ever female presidential candidate in new biopic We can not get ENOUGH of Brie Larson! Room , Short Term 12, and Trainwreck are some of our favorites. Because of this, we are so excited to hear that the Oscar-winner has an exciting new project coming up. Larson will play first female presidential candidate Victoria Woodhull ! Go Brie! Go Victoria! Go girl power!\nWe’ll admit that we’re excited for this film for another reason other than our love, Brie : we don’t know as much as we should about Victoria Woodhull.\nThe film will center on Woodhull’s incredibly interesting life . Just this summary from Deadline gave us chills for a sec:\n#victoriawoodhull #wcw #mrssatan #notoriousvictoria \nA post shared by candice (@kuroneko3012) on Nov 16, 2016 at 8:50pm PST \n“Woodhull was a suffragist who became the first woman to run and be nominated for President of the United States in 1872, more than 40 years before women had the right to vote. She was a women’s liberator, non-conformist, conniver, narcissist, politician, and rebel. Her con-artist father taught her and her sisters to channel spirits in front of crowds to bilk the superstitious. These skills formed the start for an ambitious climb that would bring Woodhull from rags to riches and back again.”\nWow. Crazy.\nAccording to the Guardian , Woodhull was called “Mrs. Satan” by a popular newspaper for running. Ugh. Sigh. She faced fierce cultural opposition and was even jailed three days before election day for sending “indecent and obscene publications” (AKA the feminist and generally far-left newspaper she published along with her sister) through the mail. She was released a month later and exonerated from all charges.\nIt has been announced that Brie Larson is set to play Victoria Woodhull in Amazon Studio's biopic about the first female candidate for the presidency of the United States. No director has been slated yet for the project but Ben Kopit will be helming the script. Larson will also produce the project. \"Woodhull was a suffragist who became the first woman to run and be nominated for President of the United States in 1872, more than 40 years before women had the right to vote.

She said while interviewing Jane Fonda about feminism for Net-a-Porter , “I’d put it all on the line and be an activist for the rest of my life because it doesn’t feel right to me to be quiet.”\nWe love your spirit, Brie! \nGot a crowd to make peace with me. When you see the film it will make even more sense. @kongskullislandmovie \nA post shared by Brie (@brielarson) on Mar 8, 2017 at 9:28pm PST \nBrie is also producing the film, so we assume it’s a passion project for her. Dope. Even better? You’ll be able to check out the flick without leaving home. It’ll be on Amazon!
