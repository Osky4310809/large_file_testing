Cousins bullied his way past Marvin Williams and got to the rim, where he finished to give Sacramento a two-point lead.\nBut he left 14 seconds on the clock, which is more than enough time for Kemba Walker , also an All-Star, to drill a patented game-winning buzzer-beater. Unfortunately, he never got the chance.\nWalker made the right play and found a wide open Frank Kaminsky at the top of the key. But Kaminsky left the three ball short and his Hornets went on to lose, 109-106.\nBoogie finished with a game-high 35 points on 13-for-22 shooting to lift his Kings to a 19-28 record, tied with New Orleans for 10th in the West. Charlotte, on the other hand, has lost four in a row and slipped to eighth place in the Western Conference.\nMaybe Kemba should shoot the game-winners from now on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T05:01:43.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
