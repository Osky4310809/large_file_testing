Sometimes for movies like this, the score doesn't have to be a musical masterpiece. It's good to just go back to the catchy themes that make us score fans love Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, and the like. The big drumms, the rhythmic strings, and powerful thematic brass is right up my alley. And then his added use of electronics is a nice Tyler touch to make it stand out on its own.The nod to the original theme is pretty amazing and Tyler does a great job at making this score his own. Despite the obvious temp track of a Jablonsky score that heavily influenced how the producers wanted the score to sound, this was a really fun listen and right up there with his Iron Man 3 score, in my opinion. Highly recommend! Worth the $10. Brian Tyler delivers! by AlexVLM I´ve never been a Power Rangers fan, not by a long shot, although my 9 year old son loves the franchise. But I love Brian Tyler´s music, he as has a way to uplift your spirit with his art and unleash your imagination, it doesn´t matter if the film is not preciely masterpiece, his talent always shines. And his music for the latest Power Rangers flick proves this. Really cool and inspiring. Thanks Brian! GO GO POWER RANGERS!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T05:45:58.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
