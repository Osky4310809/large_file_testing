It includes 274 restaurants and covers the nations of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, plus Iceland for the very first time. While this marks the first time since 2008 that Copenhagen fine-dining sensation Noma isn’t included in the guide — it’s currently closed for a major revamp , and will reopen later this year — its reach across the region’s restaurant scene is still quite evident: Earning its first star this year is Copenhagen’s 108 , the casual restaurant debuted last summer by Noma co-founder Kristian Baumann. Meanwhile, Reykjavik’s first and only Michelin star was awarded to Dill, a New Nordic restaurant owned by chef Gunnar Karl Gíslason, who moved to NYC last year to head up the kitchen at Agern, the Grand Central Station restaurant from another Noma co-founder, Claus Meyer. The 2017 guide also marks the first time that a restaurant from Denmark’s Faroe Islands has been included: KOKS, where chef Leif Sørensen uses indigenous island ingredients along with traditional techniques such as smoking and salting. In other notable inclusions, Magnus Nilsson’s Fäviken Magasinet in remote Sweden and Maaemo in Oslo both maintained their respective two- and three-star ratings. No new restaurants snagged that coveted third star this year.
