We observe Communion because the Lord told us to . We are to obey His commands: And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" 1 Corinthians 11:24 (NIV) In observing Communion we are remembering Christ and all that He has done for us in his life, death and resurrection: And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" 1 Corinthians 11:24 (NIV) When observing Communion we take time to examine ourselves : A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. 1 Corinthians 11:28 (NIV) In observing Communion we are proclaiming His death until He comes . It is, then, a statement of faith: For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. 1 Corinthians 11:26 (NIV) When we observe Communion we show our participation in the body of Christ . His life becomes our life and we become members of each other: Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ ? Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body , for we all partake of the one loaf. 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 (NIV) 3 Main Christian Views of Communion The bread and the wine become the actual body and blood of Christ. The Catholic term for this is Transubstantiation . The bread and the wine are unchanged elements, but Christ's presence by faith is made spiritually real in and through them. The bread and the wine are unchanged elements, used as symbols, representing Christ's body and blood, in remembrance of his enduring sacrifice.

And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf. 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 (NIV) \nAnd when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. 1 Corinthians 11:24-26 (NIV) \nJesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\" John 6:53-54 (NIV) Symbols Associated with Communion", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:58:56.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
