(Photo: BBC) \nRight from the off, the trailer promises \"pure drama\" and we see the return of the Doctor's friend Nardole, played by Matt Lucas, and the introduction of new companion Bill, played by Pearl Mackie. \nExplaining his TARDIS to Bill, the Doctor says: \"This is the gateway to everything that ever was, or ever can be.\" \nAnd he looks a bit upset when she tells him it looks like a \"kitchen\". \nAs they hurtle through time and space, we see glimpses of them arriving in the year 1814, travelling to Mars, and plunging deep under the sea.
