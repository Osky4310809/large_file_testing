Traveling via self-catapulting rock is cool. Inventing super jumps to skip puzzles is cool.

Thus, placing Octo Balloons on a raft to turn it into an airship, as YouTube's BeardBear has done.\nIf you wanted to fly even fast, you might be able to use the same \"motor boat\" trick that you can use to make your raft move faster in the water, but your flying machine probably won't be stable enough.\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:08:25.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
