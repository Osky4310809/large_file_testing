Questions include “do I really need both my kidneys?” “how much vitamin C is too much?” and “what’s the part of my brain that’s going to deal with my emotional breakdown tomorrow?”\n#DrKen answered medical questions for all the Twitter hypochondriacs. @wired \nA post shared by Ken Jeong (@kenjeong) on Mar 23, 2017 at 8:54pm PDT \n\nJeong’s other roles ( Community , The Hangover ) don’t exactly inspire confidence, but in this video he obviously knows what he’s talking about. He answers each question both with his signature snark and medical expertise — he even explains why exactly we do that weird knee reflex test at the doctors.\nWatch the video above, but be warned, it will make you wish your doctor was as cool as Dr Ken.\nIn other TV news, this is what your favorite Twin Peaks characters look like now.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:08:38.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
