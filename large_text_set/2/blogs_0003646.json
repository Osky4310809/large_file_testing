By: FE Online | Bengaluru | Published: February 5, 2017 10:54 AM Krishna served as an MP from Karnataka’s Mandya district starting from 1968 in the 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th Lok Sabha.(PTI) \nThough both Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party sources have suggested that Congress leader and former Chief Minister SM Krishna may join BJP , Krishna dismissed it and said it is “absurd” and he still hasn’t decided. Congress sources said that there is a possibility that Krishna may join BJP shortly. Karnataka BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa on Saturday said that Krishna is all set to join the party. Krishna recently left Congress blaming the leadership of being neglectful since 2012. \nIn Kalburagi, Yeddyurappa said Krishna joining BJP is “almost certain”. To close the deal some more talks are left to seal the deal. The veteran Congress leader will be joining BJP without any pre-conditions, said Yeddyurappa. \nThe 84-year-old Krishna also belongs to the same community as senior BJP leader and Union minister V Sadananda Gowda and former state minister R Ashoka, who belong to the Vokkaliga community. They said that they will welcome Krishna’s entry, but the state leaders cannot make any commitments without further negotiations at the highest level in the BJP. After the formalities, Krishna would be a part of the party. But Krishna rubbished this saying it is “absurd” with no elucidating comments. \nYou May Also Like To Watch: \nDK Shivakumar, Congress minister who is also close to Krishna said that congress is trying to convince Krishna to stay in the party. But some Congress sources also suggested that Krishna will join BJP shortly. Krishna on exiting Congress had said, the party wants managers who can manage the party. They do not want time-tested leaders, workers like him.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:01:35.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
