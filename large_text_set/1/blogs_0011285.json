It is misleading to imply that there are.All reputable breeders welcome you into their facilities and have contracts along with an application in order to purchase a puppy.You should always be able to view the parent/parents of your puppy along with the environment your puppy is raised in.Shelters and rescues have many animals in need of a new home (including puppies) and specific breed rescues.Pet stores acquire animals from sources who breed for profit only, purchasing from a pet store promotes animal cruelty in puppy milled/ farmed facilities, adult dogs live their entire lives in confined kennels or cages, with little or no vet care, isolated, fearful, with no caring or loving human contact.A proposed bylaw would eliminate a medium through which puppy mills sell their dogs.It would help to prevent the impulse purchase of pets in pet stores and elsewhere.It would allow rescue organizations and reputable breeders to become a more visable source for pets.It will save the Town money - the Town incurs costs caring for unwanted dogs and cats, reducing the number of unwanted and abandoned pets in Okotoks is a valid municipal concern.There is public interest ensuring pets which have already been abandoned to shelters and are being supported with public funds find a new home, towns should not be faulted for treating those facilities differently from pet stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T05:35:01.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
