SinceÂ everyone canâ€™t wait for theÂ confirmation; here it goes. I am pregnant,â€ the post read.\nâ€œPlease know this was a choice I made, I already know some wonâ€™t agree but Iâ€™ve been showered with support by the ones I love since I found out. Why did I wait? Iâ€™ve had a lot of health complications leading up to this pregnancy and I was not ready to release such private information on my own just yet being that I am so high risk with this pregnancy. I didnâ€™t want to announce just to have another miscarriage and suffer through another grief,â€ the post continued.\nOn Thursday, the MTV star shared an adorable Instagram post that featured her ultrasound photos next to a notebook for “baby memories & milestones.”\n“I can’t wait to meet you,” the expecting mom captioned the sweet photo.\nI can't wait to meet you \nA post shared by Kailyn Lowry (@kaillowry) on Mar 30, 2017 at 6:43am PDT \nFROM COINAGE: Best Home Improvement Tips for Every Budget \nLowry, 25, is already mom to Isaac Elliot, 7, whom she shares with ex-boyfriend Joe Rivera,Â and sonÂ Lincoln Marshall, 3, whom sheÂ shares with ex-husband Javi Marroquin.\nThough her third childâ€™s father is currently unknown, she onlyÂ recently finalized her divorce from Javi.

She opened up to PEOPLE, prior to the show airing, saying, â€œI like to think that everything kind of happened for a reason â€“ Iâ€™m not really sure what the reason was yet for that, but Iâ€™m just constantly reminding myself that there was a reason why this happened.â€", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:06:39.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
