A source close to Onika says that all of Remy’s alleged lies are being shot down by Trey Songz, Ebro and Lil Wayne so there is no need for her to reply.\nInstead of writing bars , Nicki is carrying on with her life and posting Instagram pic after Instagram pic to prove how much she is unbothered by Reminisce’s raunchy rhetoric.\nNone of this is to say that Nicki will NEVER respond, but it doesn’t look like it’s gonna happen anytime soon because she feel like she’s winning without saying a word.\nSounds lame. Rappers should rap, but maybe Nicki just wants to be considered a pop star. *shrug*\nImage via Instagram \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T15:30:31.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
