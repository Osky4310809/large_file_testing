John Mikel Obi in action for Tianjin Teda \nHe played in a more advanced midfield role and proved his mettle with neat, crisp passes to his fellow midfielders and strikers of the team. \nTianjin Teda are warming up for the start of the Chinese League and the capture of Mikel is one of the numerous steps they have taken to reposition their team for a better outing. \nEagles coach, Gernot Rohr has assured that as long as the experienced midfielder is playing well in China, he will be part of the national team. \n“We can still follow him on the internet and as long as he is playing well, he remains in our plans,” Rohr stated. \n“I am happy he will play in China and not sit on the bench at Chelsea.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T08:21:16.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
