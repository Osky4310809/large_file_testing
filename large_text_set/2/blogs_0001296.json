Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA four-month-old baby boy was shaken so severely by his dad that he was left permanently brain damaged and will need nursing care for the rest of his life, a court has heard. \nZsolt Lakatos admits that he shook the infant on two separate occasions but denies that he had intended to cause him serious harm. \nHe previously told interviewers he had shaken the child vigorously \"in a moment of frustration.\" \nNeville Biddle, prosecuting, said when Lakatos, known as George, was interviewed by police he was “ducking and weaving and trying to avoid questions and frequently not telling the truth”. \nEventually he admitted he had shaken the infant on two occasions, causing the serious injuries he suffered, the Liverpool Echo reports. \nBut he maintained he had not intended to cause such harm. \nLakatos, 31, of Walton, is on trial at Liverpool Crown Court where he denies unlawfully and malicious causing grievous bodily harm to the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, with intent on September 2, 2015. \nHe has pleaded guilty to two lesser charges of causing grievous bodily harm to the child on September 2 and on an earlier occasion.

(Photo: MEN) \nHe needed intensive care and had to undergo surgery to remove fluid because of a brain haemorrhage. \nMr Biddle told the jurors: “He suffered permanent injury and will require nursing care for the rest of his life.” \nIn his police interviews, Lakatos denied deliberately causing him injury. \nHe said that afterwards he had been “praying all day and crying”. \nHe denied hitting the baby or causing the rib fractures. \nThe court heard that doctors believe the fractured shin, near his right knee, could have been caused while flailing around while being shaken but was more likely to have been caused by a “yanking” or “twisting” motion. \nLakatos was interviewed for the fourth time in March last year after he had made admissions about shaking the tot during family proceedings, said Mr Biddle. \nAt that hearing he admitted “in a moment of frustration I shook him vigorously”. \nLakatos said he had not wanted him to become unconscious and had tried to revive him. \nIn earlier interviews he told how he had been holding the crying child in his arms while feeding him a bottle. \nHe said: “I didn’t mean to hurt him on either occasion. I had no idea after the first occasion that anything was wrong with him.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:06:32.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
