In Munich there is nothing given. As we have defended, you cannot stand against Bayern. In short, this was a very bitter evening.\" \nThe players out of contract in 2017 \nLewandowski felt the speed at which Bayern played was a decisive factor in their comfortable win as they move towards a 19th Pokal title. \n\"We played very well in the first few minutes and scored three goals,\" the prolific striker said. \"Schalke could do nothing. \n\"In the second half, we just played. We know we have to play every three days. Our pace was not so high.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:59:41.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
