Christian Pulisic sits down with Raf Honigstein to talk about life with Dortmund, the U.S. national team and more. Borussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel tells ESPN FC's Raf Honigstein it will be a quiet transfer window for the club. \nBorussia Dortmund have reached an \"agreement in principle\" with Chinese Super League club Chongqing Lifan over the transfer of attacker Adrian Ramos for a reported transfer fee of around €12 million. \nRamos, 30, is set to join La Liga strugglers Granada, who are under the same ownership, on loan before moving to China in the summer. \nThe Colombian requested a transfer twice in 2016, and has now been granted his wish to leave the Bundesliga side after making 79 competitive appearances in which he scored 19 goals. \n\"We have reached an agreement in principle,\" BVB media director Sascha Fligge told multiple media outlets on Tuesday , adding that final talks over the transfer will take place in the next few days. Adrian Ramos joined Borussia Dortmund in 2014. \nAlthough BVB currently are without Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who is at the African Nations Cup in Gabon, Dortmund believe that in Germany internationals Andre Schurrle, Marco Reus and Mario Gotze they have enough options in attack. \n\"I would have liked to keep him, and regret it,\" BVB coach Thomas Tuchel said . \"Adrian expressed his desire to leave in every transfer period. It's different being the No. 2 striker at his age than at a younger age. \n\"With a heavy heart, we've accepted his wish, but his decision for more playing time is understandable. Auba will come back soon, and he's our starter. We'll have other options until then.\" \nTuchel said Dortmund have not identified a replacement for Ramos, adding: \"It's not like we have an idea about that right now. To allow Adrian a transfer was an isolated decision.\" \nB.Z. reported that Hertha Berlin, Ramos' previous club in Germany, are set to receive a windfall of around 15 percent of the transfer fee thanks to a clause included in the paperwork when selling him to Dortmund for around €9.7m in 2014. \nStephan Uersfeld is the Germany correspondent for ESPN FC.
