Roger Marshall tweeted: “He’s grounded.” Just so you know @SpeakerRyan : He's grounded. https://t.co/PGGhYXEfQv \n— Dr. Roger Marshall (@RogerMarshallMD) January 3, 2017 \nDuring the photo shoot Tuesday, Cal Marshall held the Bible with his father and Ryan. As the photographer prepared to take photos, the son raised one arm in the move popularized by sports celebrities known as dabbing, hiding his face as if he was about to sneeze. \nRyan asked if he was OK, and then asked him if he was about to sneeze. \nAs the teen began laughing, Marshall said, “He’s sneezing.” \n— Jeremy Art (@cspanJeremy) January 3, 2017 \nMarshall, an obstetrician, won the 1st District seat after beating incumbent Tea Party favorite Tim Huelskamp in the Republican primary. \nRyan poked fun at the incident on Twitter. Just finished swearing-in photos. Nearly 300 members. Countless cute kids. Still don't get what dabbing is, though. pic.twitter.com/E2hFgyPYZT \n— Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) January 3, 2017 \n“Just finished swearing-in photos. Nearly 300 members. Countless cute kids.
