The first chance of the game falls to Stoke as Crouch gets up well to flick a header into the path of Arnautovic, who cuts inside onto his left foot and fires a fierce effort towards goal from 15 yards out, but Hennessey springs to his right to palm it away from danger. 7' Glenn Whelan this time tries to pick out Ramadan with another long cross-field pass but once again Ward intercepts it and nods the ball back to Wayne Hennessey. Neither side have really stamped their authority on this game yet. 5' Joe Allen and Peter Crouch link up well close to halfway before Marko Arnautovic’s attempted cross-field pass towards Ramadan Sobhi is well intercepted by Joel Ward. Stoke are certainly looking to get the ball wide here as often as possible. 3' Stoke have settled into this game quickly here and are seeing plenty of the ball but Palace look well organised at the back in the early stages. 1' Kick-off! Palace get the game underway. The players are making their way out onto the pitch, kick-off is not far away now. Crystal Palace came out on top when the two sides last met in September, with goals from Scott Dann and James Tomkins helping them to a 4-1 win over a Stoke side who were bottom of the table at the time. Crystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce makes two changes from the side that lost to Sunderland, with Luka Milivojevic coming into midfield for his debut in place of Yohan Cabaye, while Andros Townsend replaces Scott Dann in a switch which sees Palace revert back to a four man defence. Mark Hughes makes just one change to his Stoke side that were beaten by West Brom, with Ramadan Sobhi replacing Ibrahim Afellay having returned from international duty with Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations. Subs: Speroni, Sakho, Schlupp, Flamini, Cabaye, Remy, Campbell Crystal Palace (4-2-3-1): Hennessey; Ward, Tomkins, Delaney, van Aanholt; Milivojevic, McArthur; Puncheon, Townsend, Zaha; Benteke Subs: Given, Muniesa, Johnson, Berahino, Afellay, Diouf, Imbula Team news: Stoke City (4-2-3-1): Grant; Bardsley, Shawcross, Martins Indi, Pieters; Whelan, Adam; Arnautovic, Allan, Ramadan; Crouch Crystal Palace meanwhile have won just once in their last 10 Premier League outings, and suffered a humiliating 4-0 home defeat to fellow strugglers Sunderland in their last match, leaving them 19th in the table, two points from safety. That result against West Brom was though their first league defeat of 2017, following wins over Watford and Sunderland and successive 1-1 draws with Manchester United and Everton. Stoke come into the game on the back of a 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion last time out, a result which left them without a win in their last three Premier League games.
