Picture by Joe Giddens PA Wire/PA Images \nLONDON - A 27-foot sculpture made out of 100,000 knives will be placed on the fourth plinth in London's Trafalgar Square in tribute to victims of knife crime. \nThe sculpture, named \"Knife Angel,\" was created in Oswestry, Shropshire, by the British Ironwork Centre. It took two years to build. \nThe knives were handed in by 41 police forces around the country during amnesties and confiscations. \nThe campaign, \" Save a Life, Surrender Your Knife ,\" and the statue aims to raise awareness of the growing issue of knife crime throughout the UK. \n\"The monument was created for one purpose, to highlight this extensive problem. Both government and the educational system need to open their eyes to the epidemic,\" t he British Ironwork Centre's website says . \nHere are some pictures of the impressive statue: This is \"Knife Angel.\" Joe Giddens PA Wire/PA Images Families affected by knife crime, police officers, politicians, celebrities, community leaders, and ex-gang members welded their own knives on the sculpture as a symbolical gesture.
