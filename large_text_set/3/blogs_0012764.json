It also says the game will launch in Early Access first when it does eventually get a full release, and that the current price of $20 is expected to go up. \nKlei included an alpha roadmap as well, including adding more temperature related things, more ways to creates sustainable systems in your base, improved stress gameplay, new biomes, new creatures, and more. Being an alpha, Klei also specified that all of this was subject to change, and it expected to update the game \"about once every 4-6 weeks\" for now. \nSo while it's obviously not the full game, and not even the Early Access version, there's nothing stopping you from getting your hands on Oxygen Not Included right now, which I imagine will come as a surprise to most.
