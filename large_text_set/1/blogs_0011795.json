There's no offers, for me there are no problems for the renewal,\" Dybala told reporters on Wednesday. \n\"I'm fine at Juventus, my agent will be in Turin in the coming days for the renewal. \nJust like old times in landmark match for MSN \n\"I'm thinking only about Juventus.\" \nDybala has scored five goals in 17 games in all competition for Juventus, who take on Fiorentina in Serie A on Sunday.
