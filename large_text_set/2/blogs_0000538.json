I believe in the spirit of equality, and that the spirit of this country is one of love and compassion and kindness. My performance will uphold those philosophies.” \nAnd just what sort of statements has Gaga made in the past? Well, she’s slammed Trump as “one of the most notorious bullies” in history. . @MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for \"anti-bullying\" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed. \n— xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) November 6, 2016 \nShe’s protested outside his home at Trump Tower ❤️🇺🇸I want to live in a #CountryOfKindness where #LoveTrumpsHate pic.twitter.com/Eni145YgW1 \n— xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) November 9, 2016 \nAnd, in what is likely the sharpest blow to Trump’s voracious need for attention, once declined to talk about him at all , telling a BBC interviewer that she had “nothing to say” about the then-candidate. \nSpeculation about whether or not Gaga would use her performance to drag the president was fueled in part by reports that the NFL had specifically asked that she not “say anything or bring anything up about the election, or mention Donald Trump,” according to an anonymous source who spoke with Entertainment Tonight. \nA spokeswoman for the NFL later dismissed the allegation as “unsourced nonsense from people trying to stir up controversy where there is none.” \nSo what does Gaga hope to accomplish with her Super Bowl performance? Nothing short of harmonious nationwide coexistence. \n“I don’t know if I will succeed in unifying America,” Gaga said at her press conference. “You’ll have to ask America when it’s over.” \nOh, OK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:09:34.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
