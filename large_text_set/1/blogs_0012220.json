It will be developed by KAR Properties and seeks to convey an “expression of art and nature.”\nAt 800ft above the ground, the building’s skybridge will ultimately be the main attraction for guests and tenants. The L-shaped suspended platform follows the esplanade and includes indoor areas for bars and nightclubs, as well as outdoor areas complete with a palm tree court, swimming pools, and a cascading waterfall.\nWhether this is your dream home or your idea of a true Ballardian nightmare , you have to admit it’s a genius piece of architecture. Check it out above.\nIn other news, this artist turned old Mac computers into tiny tech gardens .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T18:10:37.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
