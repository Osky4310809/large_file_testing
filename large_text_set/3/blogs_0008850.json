The guys continue to kick ass â€” fronting campaigns for mega brands and creating their own products . We just learned that two of the leaders of this pack are joining forces on a makeup line. Come April, you can get your hands on Jeffree Star Cosmetics x Manny Mua goods. \nBoth influencers shared the news on their Instagram and Twitter feeds. Here's what we know so far: the packaging is black with a holographic logo featuring Jeffree's signature star and Manny's moon. We're hoping the iridescent foil means there are some unicorn-inspired pigments inside. It looks like the collab will feature multiple picks including Velour Liquid Lipsticks and Skin Frost. A sexy lip and strobed cheeks are basically all you need to get your Instagram face on! \nWatch this space for more details as they emerge.
