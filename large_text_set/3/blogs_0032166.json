It’s a friendly one, the type of rivalry that makes sports even better. We’re all for it.\nOn Tuesday, Ball told ESPN 710 Los Angeles that he felt he was better than Fultz.\n“Markelle's a great player, but I feel I'm better than him,” Ball said during an interview . “I think I can lead a team better than him. Obviously he's a great scorer — he's a great player, so I'm not taking that away from him.”\nBall is totally justified feeling like he’s better, just like Fultz should feel he’s better than Ball. That’s the confidence you’d expect from a highly regarded lottery pick. Fultz didn’t respond directly, but you should check out the likes section on his Twitter — here are a few tweets that show up there.\nLonzo Ball Says \"I'm Better\" And \"Can Lead A Team Better Than\" Markelle Fultz\n\nVIDEO: https://t.co/ifMaUTNJvp pic.twitter.com/3k5GKgTzNc \n— Ballislife.com (@Ballislife) March 28, 2017 Lonzo Ball's confidence on pic.twitter.com/I0CfpV9qoM \n— 120 Sports (@120Sports) March 28, 2017 Lonzo Ball: 'I'm Better' Than Washington's Markelle Fultz https://t.co/RcbmhRpY22 pic.twitter.com/g6gR6afLQc \n— SLAM Magazine (@SLAMonline) March 28, 2017 Lonzo Ball: I'm Better Than Markelle Fultz: https://t.co/0HNKUIoycR pic.twitter.com/FtFTyJDzPU \n— RealGM (@RealGM) March 28, 2017 The passive aggressive Twitter like is one of the best social media flexes available, so that makes sense. The one I love even more is this tweet, from a random Twitter user with less than 600 followers. He watched UCLA and Lonzo Ball lose in the NCAA Tournament , decided that really showed him something, and decided to tag Fultz in it — so Fultz liked it.\nThis game has confirmed for me that @MarkelleF should be the #1 pick. #UCLAvsUK \n— Michael G. Johnson (@MGJohnson24) March 25, 2017 It ended up getting two likes.\nFultz has also been liking tweets that just say Ball — and other point guard prospects like Dennis Smith Jr. — are committing for the draft, so this is all friendly gestures. On Wednesday, Fultz did tweet this, which pretty clearly seems like a response to Ball’s comments, albeit one that didn’t directly name him or anything.\nIn the words of Marshawn Lynch \" I'm about that action\" \n— Markelle Fultz (@MarkelleF) March 29, 2017 So let’s see: how do Ball and Fultz stack up?\nRight now, Ball and Fultz have played twice, and Ball is 2-0. UCLA and Washington played twice this season, but Fultz sat out of the second game. In the first one, UCLA trounced the Huskies in a 107-66 win. Of course, UCLA had a very talented roster this year, while Washington finished with a losing record and failed to make the tournament.\nIn that game, though, Fultz at least held his own. He scored 25 points on 9-of-19 shooting, with six rebounds, five assists and three steals. Ball dropped 22 points on 7-of-12 shooting with six rebounds, five assists and four steals.\nThe two also faced each other on different teams during the 2016 All-American game, though. Ball’s team won out 114-107, with Ball going scoreless but recording 13 assists with only one turnover. Fultz came off the bench for the East team, scoring 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting with six assists and three steals.\nWe can’t wait until the first time these two face off against each other as rookies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:24:05.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
