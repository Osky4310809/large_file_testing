She collected the award for Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress , and spoke passionately about her first introduction to “girl power” when she was a kid, which was The Spice Girls (who we love forever and always!). There was just so much heart on display.\nGrateful for all the fans who voted for girl power in the award category, she later posted an Instagram message that expanded her point — that girl power is for everyone . Thank you Thank y❤u for this honor. You all did this. We make movies for you, so your love means the most. I'm so grateful for the opportunity you gave me, and so many people by supporting The Shallows. I was so proud to stand up there last night to thank you and to share my passion and pride for #girlpower As you proved, girl power isn't just for females. ...That's so 1995. Men and women, together we are stronger.

She’s absolutely right; we are all stronger together, and each and every one of us, whether male or female or non-binary gender, should feel encouraged to step forward confidently and show the world our vulnerability and our strength as individuals.\nIn fact, “girl power isn’t just for females…that’s so 1995” could well become the slogan of 2017.\nShould we go ahead and re-live her kick ass speech? Okay.

Damn, girl! Your team-mentality inspires us to support one another and be grateful for what we have.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T03:18:36.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
