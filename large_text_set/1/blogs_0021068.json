Orji is not drawing any of such funds from Abia State, knowing the full implications of such an act.” As a man who went through the rungs of the civil service, from the Administrative Officer to the Permanent Secretary cadre, he is fully aware of the code guiding retirement of officers and so would not violate same. \n“The public at the same time is advised to disregard this unwholesome fallacy as it is unfounded and basically false in its entirety.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T13:29:00.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
