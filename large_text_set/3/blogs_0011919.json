Source: AP \nHe added: “Everyone saw the penalty to Di Maria that would have put us 3-2 up. Not to mention the penalty on Suarez.” \nHowever, new footage of the penalty Suarez was awarded in stoppage-time seems to suggest defender Marquinhos made contact with the Barca striker. \nWith the score at 4-1 in Barca’s favour, a ball was lifted over the top to Suarez. Marquinhos put his arm across the striker, but Suarez went to ground very easily. \nThe penalty was Barca’s fifth goal (that Neymar converted) before Sergi Roberto scored the sixth and vital goal in the 95th minute. When a defender trips an opposing player in the box it’s a penalty.End of story! pic.twitter.com/jzDtpO1skF", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:47:06.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
