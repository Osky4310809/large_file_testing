TRACY WATKINS Last updated 12:28, February 7 2017 MONIQUE FORD/FAIRFAX NZ \nFormer Prime Minister John Key packs up his old office. \nJohn Key is back where he began, on Parliament's back bench. But for how long? \nThe former prime minister has so far kept a low profile since stepping down for Bill English last year and it looks like that strategy will continue, with Key apparently slipping into the National caucus early this morning to avoid the usual media scrum. \nBut we know Key is around because Bill English tweeted this with a picture of himself and Key. Checking in on one of our bright, young backbench MPs before the political year gets underway. pic.twitter.com/JlMTuqyP5N â€” Bill English (@pmbillenglish) February 6, 2017 \n. \nAn updated version of Key's biography was supposed to be released last week but was delayed. It includes material from interviews following Key's resignation. \nREAD MORE: * Who are the contenders to replace Key as Prime Minister? \nApart from that, Key clearly intends to stay out of the limelight in order not to hog the headlines while English establishes himself in the leadership. \nBut it will be difficult for him to escape the media for too long around Parliament - to get to caucus ahead of the media Key would have had to arrive at least 30 minutes early as journalists and camera operators are usually milling around for some time before MPs arrive. \nPresumably he took some good reading material along with him to fill the time till the rest of his colleagues arrived. Ad Feedback \nThere is also a daily \"media scrum\" on the way into Parliament - this is where MPs cross what's known as \"the tiles\" on their way into the House, and where they are usually grabbed for comment on the issues of the day. \nKey might be hoping that the media interest in his return will die down soon enough that he can make the daily walk without attracting any interest. \nThat's more likely than the other possibility, which is that National are hoping to keep him out of the media's way till he announces his departure from Parliament altogether, probably in a few weeks time. \nTo avoid triggering a by-election in his Helensville seat Key would need to wait it out till March 23. But he could leave anytime after that so long as National is not left short on numbers in the House - and that would require agreement from Labour that one of its MPs would leave at the same time. \nThere has been speculation that outgoing former leader David Cunliffe might also be keen to leave early, allowing the status quo to remain. \nFor now, however, Key will be getting used to the view of Parliament from where he began, down among the backbenchers. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:34:13.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
