CNN reported that a “number of troops had been wounded” badly enough to require medical evacuation, but it was unclear exactly how many.   \nThe same could be said of the situation in Syria, according to The Military Times , which early last month reported that at least 14 American military personnel “have been wounded in combat since the start of October while battling Islamic State fighters in (both) Iraq and Syria.” \n— Danger 6 (@Danger6_1ID) February 20, 2017 \n“Although comparatively small when measured against monthly casualty reports from the height of America’s full-scale conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the numbers suggest that more U.S. troops are being sent closer to the Islamic State’s front lines to direct or help local forces who are in the lead,” the Times added. \nAs things heat up even further in the Middle East — which they are likely to do now that President Donald Trump is the commander in chief — such reports are apt to become more commonplace.
