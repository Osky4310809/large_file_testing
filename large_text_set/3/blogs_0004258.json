The attackers seem to have made a binary chemical weapon out of Kim Jong-nam’s face. \nKim Jong-nam was the half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. He died last week in an ambulance after falling ill at Kuala Lumpur airport. Two women were seen on CCTV wiping his face with their hands before he sought medical help. Malaysian authorities later announced there were traces of VX gas on Kim’s face. \nVX is so lethal that minute amounts can sicken and kill. Yet the attackers survived, and no one in the airport or ambulance reported symptoms, mystifying chemical weapons experts. Advertisement \nBut with reports that one of the two attackers vomited afterwards, a possible cunning scheme is beginning to emerge. Because VX is so dangerous, chemical artillery shells and bombs meant to deliver it normally contain two separate chemicals, sulphur, and a complex but non-toxic compound called QL. Two-part weapon \nIn such “binary” weapons, these are blended at the last minute to make VX. The US and Russia both have stockpiles of such weapons which they are destroying under the Chemical Weapons Treaty . \nVipin Narang at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has suggested that this is why two people were needed to attack Kim, and only one was ill afterwards. The first would have wiped a sulphur-containing liquid on his face. The second applied QL – and so would have picked up a little of the just-formed VX herself, even though both women immediately washed their hands. \nVomiting is a classic symptom of such brief, minute exposure. The convulsions with which Kim later died are also consistent with a lethal exposure to VX.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T12:24:51.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
