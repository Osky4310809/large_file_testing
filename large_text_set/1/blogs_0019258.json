His comments at the meeting echoed sentiments expressed by Trump throughout the campaign and early into his presidency on Twitter and elsewhere. \nTrump said at the meeting he’ll cut regulations, noting he believes they can cut them “by 75 percent, maybe more” and leading to expedited approvals for new manufacturing facilities, reiterating earlier commitments to do the same, and noting that environmentalism in general is “out of control” in his opinion. These comments were made with FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne in the room, whose company is currently facing both EPA and Department of Justice investigations regarding the carmaker’s alleged use of software to control emissions and skirt established U.S. limitations on the same in production vehicles. \nAlso present were GM CEO Mary Barra and Ford CEO Mark Fields, making this the first time all three top execs at the so-called Big 3 met with the U.S. President since a meeting with former President Obama in 2011 to discuss a deal that would set a target of doubling fuel efficiency across U.S. vehicles by 2025. Obviously, this meeting had quite a different tenor.

FCA also provided the following statement from Marchionne via email: \nI appreciate the President’s focus on making the U.S. a great place to do business. We look forward to working with President Trump and members of Congress to strengthen American manufacturing. \nTrump has also reportedly effectively shut down the EPA, putting a pause on all the agency’s activities while his administration reviews its budget, spending and policy initiatives, something which is highly unusual even during a transition of power. He also will sign executive orders to push both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines forward, both of which have been opposed by environmentalists, but will mean increased access to traditional fuel sources in the U.S. BREAKING Trump, at automaker CEO meeting, cites pledge to cut regulations, says environmentalism is out of control. \n— Reuters Top News (@Reuters) January 24, 2017 Featured Image: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T18:13:03.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
