The moon, which Farmer’s Almanac said was named the Full Wolf Moon by Native Americans, is expected to reach its full phase at 6:34 p.m. EST, however, people on the east coast will be able to see it as early as 5:26 p.m. EST. \nSkywatchers who aren’t able to catch the moon on Thursday will be able to see it again later that night, because it will not completely set until 7:58 a.m. EST Friday, according to EarthSky.org . The moon will reach its highest point in the sky at midnight. \nMost people will not need to use a telescope to see the moon because it will be big and bright enough to see with the naked eye. That is unless clouds sweep the night sky and block views. However, the light from the Wolf Moon should still be bright enough for folks to get a preview of it above the clouds.

However, Native American tribes during colonial times named it Full Wolf Moon due to the constant howling villagers would sometimes hear from wolves hungrily searching for food in cold winter nights. Some tribes also call January’s full moon the Moon After Yule or Full Snow Moon. In some southern hemisphere areas, the full moon in January is known as the Buck Moon, Hay Moon, Mead Moon or Thunder Moon. \nFull moons appear in the sky every 29.53 days, according to Space.com . The event marks the moment when the Earth, moon and sun are all in line, with Earth in the middle. Their alignment causes the lunar near side to become fully illuminated. \nIf staying up and watching the moon isn’t an option, people who want to see the Full Wolf Moon during peak hours can watch Slooth’s live stream event, which will air the full lunar orb on Wednesday and Thursday night.
