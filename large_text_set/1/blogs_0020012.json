Williams was rightfully confused and upset as to why he had been stopped and asked the officers for an explanation after he had been searched. One of the officers off screen said Williams was accused of being in someone’s backyard, which he denied, saying he was just walking in that area by what he thought was a trail but not in anyone’s yard. \n“Why would I be in someone’s backyard?,” said Williams. “You might’ve saw a black person and got suspicious, but I wasn’t doing anything.”\nHis frustration with the situation was clear as he explained that this wasn’t the first time he’d been in this situation because he was a black man, to which the officers recoiled and took exception. \nThe officers went on to question him as to why he was in town, to which he responded that he was visiting Earl Campbell and then had to explain he was a retired football player. Williams went on the Dudley & Bob + Matt Show on KLBJ 93.7 in Austin to explain what happened, and said he felt that if he weren’t who he was he “would’ve been in trouble.” \nRicky Williams was stopped by police in Texas… for taking a walk near his hotel pic.twitter.com/XhuFf1bl1I \n— Sports Illustrated (@SInow) January 20, 2017 \n\nWilliams was released after nearly seven minutes with the officers. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T09:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T05:25:32.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
