Who can name all of these queens? pic.twitter.com/i6KCxyNmUo \n‚Äî Live Civil (@LiveCivil) February 23, 2017 \n\nToday we take a moment to thank the universe for Alfre Woodard, the actress who is responsible for the photo above.\nFor the past eight years, Alfre has hosted an Oscar‚Äôs Sistahs Soiree to put to bed the myth that Black women in Hollywood don‚Äôt support one another. And every year, the guests take a fabulous photo that reminds us just how incredibly magical and beautiful our Black stars, and Black women period, are.\nThis year, as always, there was a wonderful mix of seasoned stars and up-and-coming entertainers from Diahann Carroll, Loretta Devine, Margaret Avery, Angela Bassett, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Pauletta Washington, and Lorraine Toussaint to Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Chandra Wilson, Rosario Dawson, Tracee Ellis Ross, Rashida Jones, and Rutha Negga, Cynthia Erivo, and Tessa Thompson.\nHow can we NOT love this room of inspiration wiht WEEN WOW @YolondaRoss ?! So much beauty and grace in one room! #weenonline #SistahsSoiree pic.twitter.com/U0FPhUonwg \n‚Äî WEEN (@WEENOnline) February 23, 2017 \n\n \nWe love seeing the ladies in their regal glory and showing off their fun side in these photos which capture the true essence of sisterhood.\nLast batch #SistahsSoiree pic.twitter.com/ouKZKqsMTe \n‚Äî Matthew A.
