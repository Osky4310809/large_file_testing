Both lived in Elk Grove. \nAt 3:05 a.m., they were in the front seats of a Honda Accord and the 1-year-old was in the back when their car drifted over a center turn lane and collided with a white panel van, said Officer Tommy Riggin. The crash occurred south of Rosemont between Harlin Drive and Mayhew Road, just east of Watt Avenue. \nThe mother and her 11-year-old were not wearing seat belts, and the infant was not fully strapped in to a car seat, Riggin said. \n“No one was properly restrained,” Riggin said. \nRenee and Gerardo Villalobos died on impact and the 1-year-old was transported to the UC Davis Medical Center, Riggin said. He did not know the infant’s condition. \nThe driver of the panel van, a Ford Transit, was conscious and alert at the scene, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:46:11.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
