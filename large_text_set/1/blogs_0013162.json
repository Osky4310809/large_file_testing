What better way to celebrate 100 years of business than with a big, flashy video? \nNikon is coming up on its 100th anniversary, July 25th to be exact , and it wants to let its customers know in a big way. Not with free gear or a signed headshot from company president Kazuo Ushida (that we know of), but with a website dedicated to the history and evolution of the company , as well as an epic video that was probably intended to be sincere, but is actually pretty grandiose and hilarious. (Just listen to that amazing voiceover!) \nEven though the video is comically over-the-top, you've got to hand it to Nikon, I mean the company has been in business for an entire century. Founded in 1917 in Japan, Nikon has spent one hundred years developing glass, cameras, and important image making technologies that we use today. \nIt was one of the companies at the forefront of the digital revolution, creating some of the first DSLRs for NASA, as well as lower cost DSLRs, like the D1, which opened up digital filmmaking and photography to professionals and hobbyists alike. In fact, Nikon's D90 camera, which came out in 2008, was the very first DSLR that had video recording capabilities. \nSo, brand loyalty and overly dramatic 100th anniversary video aside, I think we can all appreciate the fact that Nikon has done some pretty great things for the film/photo industry. Here's hoping the next 100 years bring more sweet cameras and lenses, as well as great innovation. \nIf you're a Nikon fan, you should check out its 100th Anniversary website to learn more about the history of the company. Or if you're not, you can just leave a snarky comment down below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T10:26:34.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
