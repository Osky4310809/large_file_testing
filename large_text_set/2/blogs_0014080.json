King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 20 \nDuring a recent Facebook Q&A , The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan said he no longer believes music has the power to change the world, branding its current state \"a weird Illuminati festival.\" \nThe musician noted (via Alternative Nation ): \"I think I'm more positive with where I am. I accept defeat, and accept things I don't like with a bit more grace. \n\"But I also believed much much more in my 20's in the power of music to change the world, and I don't necessarily share that same belief, which is sort of a strange tragedy really. \n\"You could make that akin to my own ego issue, which is that I no longer believe I am capable of changing the world, but I look around and I don't see a lot of people changing the world with music anymore, I see a lot of people writing the soundtrack for the apocalypse, and some sort of weird Illuminati festival.\" \nBilly added: \"Here's the positive part of it: I think human beings, in an act of self-preservation, gravitate to things that they think will make them feel better, or feel more hopeful, or want to fight the good fight. \n\"So if music doesn't do that for a majority of people these days - I shy away from criticizing popular music because it ends up coming off like a screed against a particular generation, and I don't mean it that way. I just don't see the same musical relationship in the world. \n\"I mean, I grew up, by the time I figured out who The Beatles were they'd already broken up, but the fact that there was a Beatles, and those things did happen, and people still talked about them in a particular way, and still talk about them in a particular way, it's hard to erase that memory and compare it to the Illuminati festival stuff.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:21:08.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
