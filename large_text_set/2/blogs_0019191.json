A lawsuit was reportedly filed against “ Rangoon ” maker Vishal Bhardwaj on grounds of copyright infringement, by Wadia Movietone Pvt Ltd, which has claimed that Kangana’s character Miss Julia is based on real-life Australian stunt actor Mary Evans, popularly known as Fearless Nadia. ‘Rangoon’ role not based on anybody living or dead: Kangana Asked about it, Kangana told IANS here: “I think there is some legal hassle around that. First of all, we cannot comment on a matter when it’s already in the court, but we can assure you that it’s not based on any living or dead person.” The 29-year-old actress added that “ Rangoon ” is “completely a fictional story” and the “characters are fictional as well”. “ Rangoon “, also starring Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor, will release on Friday. It is set during World War II. TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:12:31.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
