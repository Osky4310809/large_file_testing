The administration could still ask a larger panel of judges of the appeals court to reconsider the case.\nThe Associated Press reported that Trump said he is considering signing a new executive order.\nThe White House is not ruling out the possibility of rewriting Trump’s Jan. 27 order in light of the court actions, an administration official said.\nTrump’s order, which he has called a national security measure to head off attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who are banned indefinitely.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:49:23.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
