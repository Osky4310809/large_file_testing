So I know… there’s been some talk about that in the media, some politicians have said that. I just want to say thank you to everyone for coming out tonight, whether you agree or me or disagree with me. This is part of what our country’s all about.” \nWatch above, via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:49:31.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
