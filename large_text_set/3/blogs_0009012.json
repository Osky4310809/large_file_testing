A Packer has been suspended and we donâ€™t need to comment. \nJust kidding. It looks like Leroy got into Clayâ€™s stash. \nPerformance ENHANCING?

What would you expect? footballboozer says: Mar 7, 2017 5:35 PM \nI think the New Jersey Jets are in need of a few players, heâ€™s a perfect candidate. #chippy cribbage12 says: Mar 7, 2017 5:35 PM \nHe probably thinks heâ€™s still in MN. Plays like it too. Serious question here: is there any avenue for a team to release a player like this with multiple suspensions whoâ€™s still under contract while not penalizing the team for a cap hit?? If not, there should be â€“ for the benefit of ANY NFL team.
