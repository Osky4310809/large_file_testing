Syrians have argued that the building decimated in the airstrike was a newer, larger mosque facility.\nPentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said the U.S. is analyzing whether any civilian casualties occurred in the strike, but said the airstrike hit its intended target.\n\"We had tracked this building for some time,” Davis said. “We know it was being used by al-Qaeda, but at this particular time its purpose was to host this meeting of very senior people in al-Qaeda.”\nThe Al-Nafir Bulletin, titled \"Kill the Americans Without Consulting Anyone,\" called the airstrike \"a horrible crime among the crimes of America and its damned president, Trump.\"\n\"It is a clear and evident message from the carrier of the cross, America, and its allies in the east and west, and its Arab and foreign apostate agents, that 'you must, O Muslims, remain lowly and diminished, we steal your resources, we render your honors permissible, and we demolish and desecrate your sanctities. Otherwise, we will kill your children in the bellies of their mothers, we will strike your sheikhs in their mihrab, we will keep your sheikhs in the prisons of oppression and torture, and we will punish your Mujahideen on every terrain and every battleground,'\" the bulletin said.\nAl-Qaeda told \"Muslims in general and the youth of Islam in particular\" to henceforth \"not consult anybody to kill Americans.\"\n\"Proceed with the blessing of Allah, and remember that you are promised by Allah the Exalted to be in the companionship of the best Prophet, peace and blessing be upon him,\" Al-Nafir added.\nLast month, al-Qaeda accused the United States of withholding necessary medication from \"Blind Sheikh\" Omar Abdel-Rahman, the mastermind of the deadly 1993 World Trade Center bombing who died behind bars, and released what they said was his last statement in the Al-Nafir Bulletin, in which he said the Americans were using his imprisonment to \"rub the pride of the Muslims in the dirt.\"\nHe complained of being filmed while bathing or using the toilet in solitary confinement, being strip-searched \"until I am as naked as when my mother delivered me\" before \"they look into my private parts, from the front and the back -- what are they looking for?\" and of not having any fellow Arabic speakers visit. \"If it were not for reciting the Quran I would have been afflicted with many psychological and mental illnesses,\" he said.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2017/03/19/al-qaeda-order-do-not-consult-anybody-to-kill-americans/\nload more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T01:38:51.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
