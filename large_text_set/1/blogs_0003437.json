She’s not. She’s not performing,” Janelle Monae said while speaking with TMZ . \nEllen DeGeneres confirmed on Twitter that Burrell will not appear on the show. For those asking, Kim Burrell will not be appearing on my show. \n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 3, 2017 \nThe Southern songstress did confirm that both she and Pharrell will “absolutely” still appear on the talk show this week. Janelle then went on to applaud Hidden Figures for “celebrating the often-times uncelebrated.” \n“Make sure you guys tune in and watch,” she continues. “And go see the movie January 6. Hidden Figures . About the three African American women, American heroes directly responsible for getting our first astronauts into space. We are so excited about this movie.” \nShe also let it be known that she’s not here for Burrell or anyone else’s “hate speech.” \n“I don’t stand for any hate speech or anything that targets our fellow brothers and sisters in a negative way,” she says. \nJanelle also let her lack of tolerance for hate speech be known via social media. She reposted Pharrell’s “I condemn hate speech of any kind” photo and offered her own commentary.

I make no excuses or apologies. My love is as pure as it comes.” \nVideo of Kim Burrell’s rant is below.
