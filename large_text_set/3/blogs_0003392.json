Fortunately, they have Russell Wilson and a defense that’s among the best in the NFL, so they’re certain to be back in the mix next season. \nIn order for that to happen, though, there are a few needs that have to be addressed. They would benefit from adding a big-bodied receiver as well as a few offensive linemen –positions which could both be filled through free agency. Additionally, the secondary and defensive line are lesser needs, but both could use another starter or two. \nHere are five free agents the Seahawks should target. Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports Bruce Kluckhohn 5 DT Bennie Logan (Eagles) \nSeattle has three capable edge rushers in Michael Bennett, Cliff Avril and Frank Clark. What they don’t have is a dominant presence inside. Tony McDaniel is a free agent, and he wasn’t all that consistent in 2016. Logan is more of a run-stuffer, but he has experience in the 4-3 defense and would be a good addition to Seattle’s defensive line. It’s one of the few positions that could use some attention, considering how talented the Seahawks are on that side of the ball. WP 4 CB Dre Kirkpatrick (Bengals) \nThe Seahawks covet size and length at corner, both of which Kirkpatrick has. With Deshawn Shead uncertain to be ready for Week 1, and a lack of depth behind him, the Seahawks should be looking at corners in the draft and free agency. Kirkpatrick would be a nice complement to Sherman on the other side, benefitting from Seattle’s stellar safety play, too. He’s a bit thin for his height (6-2), but he can always add bulk, and he’s already a willing tackler on the edge. He’d fit nicely in Seattle’s Cover 3 scheme. George Gojkovich Getty Images 3 G Ronald Leary (Cowboys) \nThe Seahawks want to be a run-heavy team, they just don’t have the personnel to do so. Signing Leary, a terrific run-blocker, and getting Thomas Rawls and C.J. Prosise back, will help them reestablish their identity. Leary played extremely well for the Cowboys this season, and is one of the youngest guards on the market. He won’t be cheap, but relative to what other guards are going to make, he’ll be a much cheaper option. He can step in right away and be Seattle’s best offensive lineman. Tim Heitman Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports 2 LT Russell Okung (Broncos) \nOkung began his career with the Seahawks, playing six seasons in Seattle before going to Denver in 2016. He was injured often with the Seahawks, but he rebounded with the Broncos last season, playing all 16 games. While he was inconsistent, he proved he may just be past his injury history and ready to be a full-time starter again. Because of his past, he’d be a relatively cheaper option at left tackle for the Seahawks, who desperately need help at that spot, among others. Okung’s history with the Seahawks should help Seattle lure him in. Ron Chenoy Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports 1 WR Alshon Jeffery (Bears) \nThe biggest wide receiver Russell Wilson has at his disposal – who actually plays meaningful snaps – is Jermaine Kearse, who’s 6-1. Outside of him, Jimmy Graham is Wilson’s biggest target. Jeffery is a big, physically dominant receiver, standing at 6-foot-3 and playing much bigger than even that. He would give Wilson a big weapon on the outside to go along with Doug Baldwin, who’s a great receiver on crossing routes and underneath throws – not so much deep routes down the sideline. He’d also help the Seahawks in the red zone where they tend to struggle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T16:11:45.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
