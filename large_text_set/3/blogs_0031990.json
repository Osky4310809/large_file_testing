But Navalny still faced a weightier charge of refusing to obey police.\nHe was among more than 1,000 people taken into custody after police and protesters clashed around the epicenter of the demonstration, a statue to the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. It was an unusually large number of detainees compared to recent protests, and a sign of how authorities might respond if protesters try it again.\nNavalny’s Moscow office, the Anti-Corruption Foundation , was ransacked by police , who took away computers and other equipment, according to his press secretary, Kira Yarmysh. A lawyer for the foundation said 13 employees had been detained.\nNavalny had called on people to come out after publishing a report that alleges that Putin’s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, has amassed a fortune in luxury yachts, estates and vineyards.\n[ Russian police arrest anti-corruption leader Navalny, hundreds more in nationwide rallies ]\n“Yesterday’s rallies, especially the number of them in outlying regions — we haven’t seen anything like that since the 1980s — first of all shows how completely artificial that famous 84 percent support is,” Navalny told the Post via Facebook Messenger in the courtroom, referring to Putin’s approval rating , which hasn’t dipped below 80 percent in three years.\nPutin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, responding to the protests for the first time Monday, told Russian news agencies that the rally was a “provocation” because its organizer lied when they told people it was legal. “We cannot respect those who mislead people by calling for illegal rallies,” Peskov added.\nHe also claimed that teenagers at the rally had been paid to turn out.\nPeskov, as has become his practice, avoided mentioning Navalny by name. Actually, demonstrators did that at Sunday’s rally, too: No one was chanting Navalny’s name at the Moscow rally. The chants were “We want answers,” “You can’t jail everyone,” and “Shame.”\nOfficial Moscow has dismissed Navalny, who has said he will run for president in 2018, as a widely reviled nuisance with little political support and whose allegations of official corruption are an attention-grabbing stunt. However, a conviction in a fraud case, which Navalny says was politically motivated, could block him from entering the race.\nPutin, who almost certainly will run for reelection or anoint his successor, is hoping for a landslide to validate his past six years of authoritarian rule. State-run television, where most Russians get their news, ignored the rallies, including the one in Moscow, where by some estimates 25,000 people showed up.\nAuthorities had sought to keep people from turning out by refusing to grant permits to organizers in dozens of cities and warning of arrests if the demonstrations were held without permission.\nInstead, the rallies appear to amount to the largest coordinated protests in Russia since the street protests that broke out in 2011 and 2012 after a parliamentary election that opposition leaders decried as fraudulent. Back then, Putin accused Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time, of inciting the protests.\nOn Sunday night, the State Department condemned the detentions, saying in a statement that “detaining peaceful protesters, human rights observers, and journalists is an affront to core democratic values.” It added that “the United States will monitor this situation, and we call on the government of Russia to immediately release all peaceful protesters.”\nPeskov said the Kremlin “cannot agree with the appeal” to release the detained protesters, who, he said, had broken the law by attending protests that hadn’t received permits.\nIt remained to be seen how Russia’s small, fractured opposition could take advantage of the popular discontent.\nVladi­mir Milov, the leader of Democratic Choice, one of a handful of opposition parties, suggested that Russia under Putin had reached a turning point.\n“The entire country is against Putin, no one turned out to support Putin,” Milov wrote in his party’s Livejournal blog . “We say that the only thing propping up this regime is law enforcement and brutality, but even here there are signs of cracking.”\nSergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin analyst, agreed that Navalny had scored a “serious success” by carrying off rallies in dozens of cities “despited the bans and arrests.” He also took note that the crowd was younger than the people who usually show up at demonstrations.\n“The new phase of the radical oppositions is clearly not aiming at elections, where pensioners vote, but on mass disorder in the streets, where young men of draft age take part,” he said.\nBut Navalny said that the rallies in Siberia, the Far East, the Urals and other outlying regions suggested strong support for his anti-corruption platform in an election campaign.\n“If thousands of people turn out for unsanctioned meetings in the regions, that means millions support them,” Navalny said. “This confirms that people will come out to elect a person with my views. Now our demand to allow me to run looks even more authoritative.”\nRead more:\n10 critics of Putin who died suspiciously\nA film about a slain Putin critic gets a screening just off Red Square\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@davidfilipov", "https://fbk.info/english/about/", "https://twitter.com/Kira_Yarmysh/status/846115235790553088", "http://www.levada.ru/en/", "https://fbk.info/english/english/post/304/", "http://demchoice.livejournal.com/43462.html", "https://twitter.com/arothwp", "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostworld/"], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:54:34.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
