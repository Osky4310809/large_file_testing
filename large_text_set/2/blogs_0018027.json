The online video streaming giant just released the first official poster of his special and it makes you realise how massive this is going to be. Why you ask? Because it has the names of Jerry Seinfeld , Chris Rock , Amy Schumer , Aziz Ansar , and David Chapelle , along with Vir’s name. Vir Das \nThese ace comedians have all had their own exclusive shows on Netflix, and now Vir is next in line to take the world by storm this April 2017. So exciting!
