That's exactly what Lovely — a new wearable that is part tracker, part sex toy — is aiming to provide.\nThe device, on sale today for $169, is essentially a stretchy silicone ring worn around the base of the penis — though it could also be put on a finger or a dildo . It uses sensors to measure movement and position and sends that info to an app (available for Android and iOS) via Bluetooth. You can then see your top speed, the number of thrusts you recorded and how many calories you burned during sex.\nIf that wasn’t intimate enough for you, the device also vibrates to provide clitoral stimulation, and it promises to enhance erections, too, by constricting blood flow to the penis.\nBeyond giving you immediate feedback, the point of the app — which is aimed at couples of all orientations — is really to enhance your sexual experience by offering up personalized recommendations for new positions and stimulation techniques.\nCreated by Jakub Konik, the Lovely began as an Indiegogo campaign in 2016, but it is now a real live product that Konik told Mashable is generating strong international interest, even without any formal marketing. It is already available in India for pre-order and should also be popping up in other countries soon.\nImage: lovely\nThe unit's battery is meant to last two hours when vibration is on and seven hours when it isn't and can be recharged using a wireless base. The unit is one-size fits all and comes in “wild green” and “soft pink.” It's shipping out to customers in the U.S. now, just in time for the data-driven Valentine in your life.\nFitness trackers bring out the obsessive nature in many of us — gotta log those daily steps! — so it will be interesting to see whether Lovely users experience the same competitive urges. Though proceed with caution, since reaching top thrust speeds could get slightly, um, uncomfortable, if you go overboard.\nBONUS: Finally, a device that can work out your vagina", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/thL9ixDr.jpg", "https://player.vimeo.com/video/191760997", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q7-ZPHrrv7Of3fIUQt89bOP19pU=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366593%2F3a301c82-e6c3-4884-ab71-baed0ff605bc.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NzL3jq1wJfg2ptow3DwZNqwJj1U=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F366593%2F3a301c82-e6c3-4884-ab71-baed0ff605bc.jpg", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/05/lovely-sex-tracker_n_7519630.html", "https://www.ourlovely.com/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/thL9ixDr.m3u8", "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lovely-the-smart-wearable-sex-toy-for-couples#/"], "published": "2017-01-31T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:15:32.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
