However, Verizon has revealed to Fortune that \"thousands\" of its customers are still using the device, posing a legitimate safety risk:\nIn spite of our best efforts, there are still customers using the recalled phones who have not returned or exchanged their Note 7 to the point of purchase. The recalled Note 7s pose a safety risk to our customers and those around them.\nVerizon rolled out an update that prevents the Note 7 from charging on January 5, but it looks like a few users managed to avoid installing the update. The carrier is now undertaking additional measures to recover the device. Starting today, Verizon will redirect all calls — excluding those for 911 emergency services — placed from the Note 7 to its customer service department.\nVerizon may also charge Note 7 holdouts for the full retail price of the phone, even if they were reimbursed previously. With the Note 7 costing upwards of $850 at launch, Verizon is hoping that the financial penalty will convince the remaining Note 7 customers to turn in their devices.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 7 Galaxy Note 7 fires, recall and cancellation: Everything you need to know Survey results: Samsung users stay loyal after Note 7 recall Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review The latest Galaxy Note 7 news Join the Note 7 discussion in the forums!
