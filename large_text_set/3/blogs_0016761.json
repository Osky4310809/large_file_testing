HARD RAW POWER G HISSS POW! It will be great’ Monday 20 March 2017 12:50 GMT Click to followThe Independent US The President's budget was lambasted in the piece Getty \nA satirical story claiming Donald Trump ’s first budget “makes perfect sense” has been mistaken for a real article and included in the White House’s online daily briefing. \nThe article, entitled ‘Trump’s budget makes perfect sense and will fix America, and I will tell you why,’ published on the Washington Post , was included as a link on the White House’s ‘1600 Daily’ . \nThe briefing page carries news, events and updates from the White House, including a daily schedule for the President and links to news stories that generally favour the administration. Donald Trump budget slashes funding to spend $54bn on defence \nWritten by columnist Alexandra Petri, the article stated: “This budget will make America a lean, mean fighting machine with bulging, rippling muscles and not an ounce of fat. America has been weak and soft for too long. BUT HOW WILL I SURVIVE ON THIS BUDGET? you may be wondering. I AM A HUMAN CHILD, NOT A COSTLY FIGHTER JET. You may not survive, but that is because you are SOFT and WEAK, something this budget is designed to eliminate.” \nOn the proposed 29 per cent cut to the State Department, Ms Petri wrote: “With the money we will save on these sad public servants, we will be able to buy lots of GUNS and F-35s and other cool things that go BOOM and POW and PEW PEW PEW.” \nThe article, which ends with the words, “RAW POWER! HARD RAW POWER G HISSS POW! It will be great,” was included in the news reports section of the 1600 Daily on 17 March. The link has since been removed, but screenshots of the mistake were tweeted by readers to Ms Petri. \nWriting on Philly.com , Ms Petri described her article as “a piece composed almost entirely of onomatopoeic noises (PEW PEW! G !) typed out in all caps”. @petridishes Your parody piece was featured in the White House's \"1600 Daily\" email today pic.twitter.com/kgjOkwfnHg — Will R.
