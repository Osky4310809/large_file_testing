They were on one heck of a hot streak, correctly predicting the winner of 8 out of their first 11 Super Bowls. Even going so far as to predict almost every aspect of the big game 2 years ago, including the final score . This year’s sim is in, and it promises one heck of a game. \nStarting with an opening drive Touchdown by Falcons Running Back Tevin Coleman. \nPatriots 0 – Falcons 7 2 \nTom Brady and the Patriots fire back with a 30 yard pass to Chris Hogan for the TD. \nPatriots 7 – Falcons 7 3 GIF \nEntering the 2nd quarter, Falcons Tailback Devonta Freeman broke loose on a toss to scamper in for the Falcons 2nd score of the game. \nPatriots 7 – Falcons 14 4 GIF \nThat would be the score going into halftime, but coming out of the locker room (having enjoyed the Pepsi halftime show) Dion Lewis would take a pass in the flat from Brady and tie the game at 14. \nPatriots 14 – Falcons 14 5 GIF \nBoth teams would then exchange field goals, before the Patriots took the lead on a 48 yard kick from Stephen Gostkowski to put the Patriots 3 points ahead.
