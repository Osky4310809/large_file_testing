Shares \nIn his review of Gears of War 4 last year, Wes wrote that he wished the instalment \"didn't feel exactly like the kind of shooter campaign [he'd] played a dozen times since 2006\". Turns out, the series co-creator Cliff Bleszinski – who is now developing LawBreakers with Boss Key Productions – feels vaguely the same way. \nIn an interview with Gamespot , Bleszinski says he enjoyed the game, though noted that it refrained from taking any risks – referencing Star Wars: The Force Awakens as a similar example. \"\"What [studio The Coalition] did was give the people what they want. He [Rod Fergusson] did the J.J. Abrams Episode VII. \n\"I've watched Episode VII five times,\" he continued. \"I still get misty-eyed and get all excited but when I think objectively about it, I'm like, 'There wasn't a lot of risk there.' So I'm hoping they take a little bit more risk in the future.\" \nAs for Bleszinski's current game, LawBreakers, it's getting a closed beta testing period later this month . According to the studio, much has changed since the last time the game was available to play to the public, with Bleszinski saying \"I want to make the character-based, first-person shooter for the Halo, Call of Duty, Battlefield crowd.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Shaun Prescott Shaun is PC Gamer’s Australian Editor.
