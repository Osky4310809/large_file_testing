(Picture used for representative purpose; Credit: PTI) \nPolice today recovered a hand grenade and a bomb in Manipur’s Imphal West district where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address an election rally tomorrow. The recovery comes even as an apex body of six rebel groups in Manipur has given a call for a “complete shutdown” in the state tomorrow to protest against Modi’s visit, saying it was aimed at “hoodwinking the people of Manipur”. The Prime Minister will address a rally at Langjing Achouba ground in Imphal West district in support of BJP candidates in the ensuing Assembly polls. \nA Chinese-made hand grenade was found near the gate of BJP candidate Soibam Subhachandra’s residence at Ningombam Leikai, 9 km away from the Achouba ground, while another bomb was found in front of another BJP worker O Sunil’s residence in Thoubal district, 40 km away from the rally venue. The shutdown called by the Coordination Committee (Corcom) will begin at 6 AM and continue till the Prime Minister leaves the state, a Corcom press release said. \n“Narendra Modi’s visit to Imphal on February 25 is another trip aimed at hoodwinking the people of Manipur,” the release said. Essential services like medical, media, water supply, electricity and fire services would be outside the purview of the shutdown, the statement said. Police have intensified frisking all over the state capital to ensure that there was no loophole in the security arrangements for the Prime Minister’s visit. \nAlso Watch: \nState police commandos under the supervision of Additional SP S Ibomcha and led by DSP Thankhochon and OC Thaingampou carried out search operations and house-to-house verification at Taobungkhok Awang Leikai. Polling for the 60-seat Manipur Assembly will take place in two phases on March 4 and March 8.
