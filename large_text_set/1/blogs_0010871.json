Image copyright BBC/Hartswood Films Image caption The series was the fourth outing for Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman in Sherlock The series final of BBC One's Sherlock drew its lowest-ever overnight UK ratings on Sunday night. \nAround 5.9m tuned in to watch Benedict Cumberbatch in The Final Problem, down from the 8m who watched the first episode of the series on New Year's Day. \nHowever, viewing figures will be higher when on-demand services are taken into account. \nThe BBC says it is investigating how the episode was leaked online before it was broadcast on TV. \nThe last instalment of the fourth series was screened on BBC One on Sunday evening hours after a Russian language version emerged online. \n'Full investigation' \nIt featured a brief continuity announcement linking it to Russia's Channel One, which owns the rights to show Sherlock in Russia. \nA spokesman said: \"BBC Worldwide takes breaches or our stringent content security protocols very seriously and we have initiated a full investigation into how this leak occurred.\" \nThe series was the fourth outing for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective, played by Cumberbatch, and starring Martin Freeman as Dr John Watson. \nSherlock's nemesis Moriarty, played by Andrew Scott, made his return as part of a flashback sequence which saw him team up with Sherlock's secret sister, Eurus, before he died. \nThe pair enticed the detective, Dr Watson and Sherlock's brother Mycroft into a series of games. It also featured a cameo appearance by singer Paul Weller. \nWriter Steven Moffat has fuelled speculation that The Final Problem could be the last ever Sherlock. \nHe said: \"We're not planning it to be (the final), but it might be. We could end it there. We couldn't have ended it on any of the previous series because they always ended in walloping great cliff-hangers, usually by Andrew.\" \nThe episode received mixed reviews from the critics. \nMichael Hogan wrote in the Daily Telegraph \"if this was the last-ever episode, which it surely won't be, it worked well as a sign-off\". \n\"Last night's episode showcased all the elements that have made this modern-day reinvention such a hit - as well as those that have proved divisive.\" \nHe gave it five stars and called it \"an exhilarating thrill-ride\". \nBut Christopher Stevens in The Daily Mail gave it no stars and said that the episode was \"an abject, flailing, noxious mess\", \"shockingly bad\" and \"self-indulgent rubbish\". \n\"If you've woken up this morning with the angry feeling that you were robbed of an evening's entertainment, I share your sense of betrayal. Sherlock was, quite simply, the most nonsensical, verbose piece of television I've ever sat through,\" he wrote.
