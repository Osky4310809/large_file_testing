Compared to May of last year, just about every religious group is less likely today to support the ban. They’re learning! \nIn fact, only one group goes in the opposite direction: white evangelical Christians. They’re sticking their fingers in their ears as people explain why the ban makes for awful policy and clinging to their belief that America needs to be closed off to people who don’t believe as they do.. \nSo much for helping people who are struggling. \nIt’s also worth noting that white evangelicals are also, as usual, on the other side of the issue from young Americans overall: \nOpposition to a temporary Muslim travel ban is much higher among young adults than older Americans. Eight in ten (80%) young adults oppose a temporary Muslim travel ban , compared to a slim majority (53%) of seniors. Only 20% of young adults support this policy. \nEvangelicals may have the power right now, but young people are once again learning that you can’t look to the Christian church for guidance, goodness, or morality. On the simplest moral issues of our time, evangelicals are failures. I hope that this support of a ban on immigration, much like their stance on marriage equality and LGBT rights, comes back to bite them in the ass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:32:45.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
