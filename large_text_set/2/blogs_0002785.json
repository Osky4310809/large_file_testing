Lampard for sure for this club is a legend. He played 13 years and won a lot. He played 100 or more times for the national team. \nBarcelona injuries, suspensions and line-up vs Athletic Club \n\"But I think we must respect his decision because every player understands the right moment to end his career. \n\"I have great respect for him, for his career and for the man. I don't know him very well, but I heard a lot of positive things about him.\" \nPressed on a potential role for Lampard at the club, Conte added: \"I don't know his thoughts. \n\"It's important when you decide to finish your career to take a bit of time to decide to make the best decision for you. \n\"I think Frank can decide which is the best way for him in football, but I don't know his thoughts.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:42:10.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
