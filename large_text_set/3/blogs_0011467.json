That is what needs deliverance and healing and, honestly, they should have more exposure to the Ten Commandments so that they would be free from their demonic influence .” \nWhich Commandments, I wonder, would free someone from demonic influence? The one about not committing adultery or the one about keeping the Sabbath Day holy? \nAnd if the concern is that atheists don’t know the Ten Commandments, that’s probably not even true. At least one credible survey has found atheists have more religious knowledge than believers themselves. \nWe know what the Commandments are. We know why they’re not the basis for our nation’s laws. We know why the government shouldn’t promote them. And we know that the people hell-bent on putting Ten Commandments monuments everywhere have no good secular reason for it. (Hell, just ask them to name the ten and hilarity will ensue .) \nDemons didn’t influence the atheists who sued over this monument. They sued because the monument was an illegal endorsement of Christianity by the government. \nYou’d think a former legislator would understand the Constitution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:38:30.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
