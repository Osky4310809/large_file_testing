One police officer was killed and seven others were wounded in conflicts between supporters of Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. \nThursday’s blast was the deadliest to hit Baghdad since a huge truck bomb attack claimed by IS set two shopping arcades in the Karrada district on fire and killed more than 320 people in July. \nSince October, U.S.-backed Iraqi troops have engaged in an intense operation to regain the ISIS hub of Mosul in northern Iraq. \nIraqi military forces have secured the eastern party of the city and are expected to advance on western Mosul in the coming days. Even so, ISIS has carried out near-daily attacks in Baghdad. \nBaghdad had seen a wave of similar attacks since the start of the year, but the number had dropped until this week. \nThe Iraqi government has expended countless resources in its attempt to secure Baghdad. Measures have included checkpoints, blast walls and other measures, but militants have consistently found ways through. \nIn November, an explosion killed at least 70 people, most of them Iranian pilgrims, at a gas station south of Baghdad, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State.
