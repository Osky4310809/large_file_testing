Victorian philanthropists created clubs such as the Sunderland Street Waifs Rescue Agency and Street Vendors Club at about the same time that education was expanded and employment law was introduced. \nIn the early 1900s, councils were given the power to spend money on youth facilities, eventually leading to the first local authority clubs. With rising concerns about juvenile delinquency coinciding with the ending of national service, the Albemarle report of 1960 led to the building of local authority-run youth centres across the country, mainly on council estates. A national training college for youth workers was set up, and youth work was established as a paid occupation, though still with a great deal of voluntary involvement. If philanthropy comes to the rescue of the service, we will have come full circle \nHalf a century on, many of the 1960s youth club buildings are now closed and demolished, while youth services are under threat as never before. Research by Unison , based on a Freedom of Information request to 168 local authorities, shows that youth services lost at least £60m of funding between 2012 and 2014. More than 2000 jobs were lost. Around 350 youth centres closed and 41,000 youth service places for young people and at least 35,000 hours of outreach work by youth workers were cut. \nResearch demonstrates the impact of youth work on young people’s lives . Youth workers help young people through difficult times, signpost them to health and other services, go with them to court, support them to find employment or housing. Young people trust youth workers because of the relationships they have built up, on a rock climbing trip or simply over a game of pool. Youth workers meet young people on their own territory and in all youth work interventions the young person chooses to be there and to engage. Open access work means that young people are not stigmatised and can enjoy their leisure time in a safe space with their peers. For those with mental health issues, a local youth work presence can be a vital lifeline. \nIn the 1980s I ran a youth centre in the north-west and took young people to the mountains and on trips abroad. They were exposed to ideas and activities they had never experienced, but which their families could not afford to offer them. I strongly believe that such experiences should not be confined to young people whose parents are well off. \nCouncils spend huge amounts on targeted children’s social work services but intervention often comes too late. As well as a duty of care to young people who are in care or in the youth offending system, the state has a duty to young people who are not in trouble, though they may be having difficulties at home or in school. Are private partnerships the answer to the youth services funding crisis? Read more \nMany publicly funded services are under threat, from parks to hospitals, but it looks as though youth work may be the first to lose its public funds completely. Youth work does survive in the voluntary sector and in faith communities. Initiatives such as OnSide bring private money and local authorities together. But if they have to rely entirely on the voluntary sector, youth workers will spend most of their time looking for the funding they need to continue. If philanthropy comes to the rescue of the service, we will have come full circle. \nMany adults today look back on their time having fun at the “youthy” or the “boysie” with great affection. They wish that something like it was there for their own children. It built a solidarity and shared experience that people still reflect on and value. Unless we act soon, these memories may soon be the only legacy of the youth clubs opened by the Victorians.
