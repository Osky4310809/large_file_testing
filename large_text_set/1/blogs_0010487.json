He and Huma continue to co-parent their son. He is spending a lot of time at their apartment, and lives the rest of the time with his mother” Frances Weiner, who is believed to have a small place in Park Slope.\nA source added of Weiner, “He knows he’s hit rock bottom. But now they are both out of the limelight, they can focus on their son. They are actually getting on pretty well, and he and his friends are hoping that they might reconcile.”\nFor now, we’re told the divorce is still on.\nOther sources added, “A reconciliation is very unlikely.”\nHuma Abedin and Anthony Weiner Getty Images Abedin announced in August that she was splitting from her horndog hubby after he sent a picture of his crotch to a woman while his son was in bed next to him.\nShe said, “After long painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what’s best for our son, who is the light of our life.”\nThen, a few weeks later, it was revealed that he had been sexting with a 15-year-old girl over a period of months.\nWeiner was packed off to a $25,000, 35-day, all-male sex rehabilitation program at the Recovery Ranch in Tennessee, where he was seen horseback riding in the woods.\nThe US Attorney’s office in Manhattan is investigating Weiner over the alleged sexting with the teenage girl. Our source added, “His lawyers are negotiating with the US Attorney’s office. No charges have been filed as yet.”\nWeiner and Abedin didn’t get back to us Wednesday night.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T04:21:23.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
