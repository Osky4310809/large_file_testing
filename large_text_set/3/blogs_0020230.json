She stopped running to shop (Photo: RM70) \nShe said she was feeling \"blessed\" that she'd managed to turn her life around, writing alongside a selfie: \"Super excited to board the plane home to the UK excited to see my babies my mates and get back to work a busy life and no ones wife is a life well lived.. \n\"Feeling super blessed at the turn around in my life lately.. hard work determination and never ever letting my problems, my mental health, my bad choices in who I've trusted get the better of me. \n\"Everything happens for a reason and out of every bad time comes some good. Strength keeps growing my character builds and my faith deepens.. my heart still on my sleeve and my loyalty never broken .. I'm truly grateful for everything I have and for the people I share that with [sic].\" She got a new hair do while she was there (Photo: danniellawestbrook/Instagram) Fans loved her new look (Photo: danniellawestbrook/Instagram) \nMeanwhile, Danniella has said said she'd love to return to her role in EastEnders - but fears bosses would just \"use\" her for PR. \nWhen asked if she'd ever think about returning to the show, Danniella told The Sun Online : \"Always, love EastEnders. The last time I went back fans [wanted me back] because [Sam’s] a superbitch and there’s good tension between her and Sharon and all that stuff. \n\"And now because you haven’t got the Pauline, Peggy and Pat types older characters and it needs Sam, Sharon and Roxy but they just won’t do it. \n\"They just will not do it. They have said I’m sacked, I’m this and that, they seem to use me for PR and not for the work.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:42:40.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
