You have been warned.\" Danny Dyer's mum has spoken out about his alleged drunken antics (Photo: BBC) \nChristine explained that she was worried he would make the same mistakes he made on the previous year's show, which saw Danny slate the Royal Family and target then Prime Minister David Cameron , stating: \"I don't believe he's got a c**k.\" \nDespite her warnings, the EastEnders star still appeared pretty drunk as he exposed his testicle to Alan and fellow celebrity guest Mel B. \n\"Danny went through every alcohol stage during the six-hour record, from fun drunk to silly drunk, morose drunk, angry drunk and slumped drunk, and ended by flashing his surprisingly large ball bag at me and Mel B,\" the presenter said.

I mean, I did try to give up drinking but — as you can see — I’m now sucking on a lager.\" \nClearly, he still hasn't achieved his goal to give up boozing as the 39-year-old actor, who plays Mick Carter, was spotted supping a couple of beers as he jetted out to South Africa on February 10 after being given a break from EastEnders.
