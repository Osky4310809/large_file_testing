When this occurs, the sun’s elongated loops stretch and sway above it. NASA says these loops are actually charged particles that are made visible by “extreme ultraviolet light.” When they’re moved along the magnetic field lines of the active region of the sun, you can see glimmering yellow lights.\nThe video covers nearly 30 hours of activity.
