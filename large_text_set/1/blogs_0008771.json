Sansern Kaewkamnerd told MENAFN. \nSouthern Thailand is a major rubber-producing area, and the flooding comes at a particularly bad time for farmers. \n\"I've had orders from China but we aren't even sure if we can meet these orders because of the havoc the floods have caused,\" Uthai Sonlucksub, president of the Natural Rubber Council of Thailand told Reuters.\"This the worst impact we have had in the area in 10 years.\" \nUthai said that rubber prices would increase this year because demand is set to exceed supply. \n(MORE: Storm Topples Iconic Sequoia in Northern California ) \n“Floods mainly cause damage to roads, bridges and transport routes, but not much to machinery or the production process, which are generally covered by insurance,” he said. “So the impact on the private sector is quite limited.” \nNamchaisiri told the Post that the Joint Standing Committee on Commerce, Industry and Banking have estimated damages to the economy will be around $280 million and should not exceed $420 million.
