Below, discover a made-in-Canada kaleidoscope of racial slurs, drinking terms and words that sound dirty but aren’t.\n—\nGhost car \nCountries all around the world feature unliveried police cars, but Canada is the only one to assign these vehicles with the magnificent term of “ghost car.” Everywhere else, they go by the more pedestrian terms “undercover car” or “unmarked car.”\nStuart Dryden/QMI AGENCY A ghost car on the case in Calgary. —\nFat City \nA nickname for Ottawa . The term is somewhat ironic, because Ottawa is actually a relatively fit place, what with all those high-paid bureaucrats buying kale and gym memberships. But it refers to the classical usage of obesity as a sign of wealth. While every other city may need to tighten its belt at times of recession, Ottawa’s tax dollars keep it “fat.”\nCanadian Press/Justin Tang Just look at these fatties. —\nCorporate welfare bum \nThis is a rare political term that is beloved by both NDPers and Conservatives; both of whom purport to hate “corporate welfare bums.” NDP leader David Lewis appears to have invented it and — despite the best efforts of former U.S. presidential candidate Ralph Nader — the term continues to be used almost exclusively in Canadian political debates.\nTim O'Lett / The Ottawa Citizen David Lewis: Hated bums. —\nCube van \nAnother excellent Canadian term for a vehicle that the rest of the world is too stubborn to adopt. A cube van refers to the type of two-axle moving truck typically rented out by U-Haul. Incredibly, online analyses by dictionary editors found almost no mention of this term outside Canada.\nPostmedia File It's a cube on a van. How come we're the only ones who thought of this? —\nCPR strawberries \nA word reminiscent of the days when it was really hard to get fresh fruit across much of Canada — particularly when all your groceries came by way of the CPR. From the 1880s to the Great Depression, workers sick of prunes began trying to brighten their meal choices by referring to them as just another variety of strawberry.\nJoe O'Connal for National Post Get 'em while they're fresh. —\nBylaw \nEasily one of the most surprising entries on the list. While “by-law” originated as a British term, only Canada has taken it up as an almost universal descriptor of a community-specific law. The rest of the English world has municipal laws, to be sure, but they refer to them as “regulations” or “ordinances” or subsections of a “code.”\n—\nGretzky effect \nThe dictionary is utterly filled with hockey terms that, while not necessarily Canadian, are considered Canadianisms simply because we have so many hockey fans. The Gretzky effect refers to how Wayne Gretzky’s trade to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 helped to popularize hockey in California and other warm-weather U.S. states. Notably, this appears to be a skill unique to the Great One. While English football great David Beckham was similarly exported to Los Angeles in 2007, North America still refuses to care about soccer.\nCanadian Press/Ray Giguere August 9, 1988. Never forget. —\nBarley sandwich \nA nickname for beer, often employed when the beverage is being used to substitute for a proper meal. This term is almost never seen outside Canada, possibly because they have healthier drinking habits — or are at least more direct about it.\n—\nMolson muscle \nAnother clever term invented to smooth over Canada’s national drinking problem. A Molson muscle is a beer belly , and the term is almost certainly not endorsed by the Molson Coors Brewing Company.\nFile Photo Two particularly impressive Molson muscles. —\nHad the biscuit \nDeep sixed. Bought the farm. Gave up the ghost. The term “had the biscuit” doesn’t need to specifically refer to death, it just refers to the state of being finished, spent or done with something. There is speculation that the term originated in the First World War, when dying soldiers were placed on “biscuits,” or field mattresses.\n—\nCyberspace \nNot an exclusively Canadian term, to be sure, but it was invented here . Author William Gibson was in Vancouver when he first included it in his 1982 short story Burning Chrome. However, Canada can lay claim to monopolizing another “cyber” word: Cyberbullying .\n—\nBeaver fever \nIt doesn’t take a lot of imagination to imagine a sexual connotation for this word. In fact, as IMDB informs us , there are at least five X-rated movies with this exact title. However, in Canada, beaver fever is a decidedly unsexy parasitic disease transmitted in part thanks to beavers. The term is not exclusive to Canada , but seems to be in wider usage by simple virtue of us getting sick from beavers more often. \nPete Fisher/Northumberland Today/Postmedia Network Destroyer of forests. Bringer of pestilence. —\nGlory hole \nMost of the internet is pretty well agreed that a glory hole is an opening in a washroom stall that can be used for anonymous hookups. But try to explain that to an elderly Ontario sports fisher, who might innocently use the term to refer to a particularly rich fishing spot .\n—\nDouble-fisting \nIn parts of New Zealand, double-fisting reportedly refers to a potentially impossible sex act involving two fists. Fortunately, Canadians have once again devised a more innocent meaning for this word: Holding an alcoholic drink in both hands .\nTed Jacob, Calgary Herald See? Nothing sexual about it at all. —\nBody-rub parlour \nThis term is sexual, by contrast, and it is notable for being unapologetically boring and clinical. Used across Canada, a “body-rub parlour” refers to a massage parlour that clandestinely offers sexual services on the side. These establishments exist around the world, of course, but they are usually given more exciting names like “erotic massage parlours,” “rub and tug parlours” or “late night masseuses.”\nLondon Free Press/Postmedia Network The Five Senses Spa in London, Ont., an alleged body rub parlour shut down by police. —\nBreakup \nMost of the English-speaking world knows this word to mean the end of a romantic relationship. But only in Canada and parts of Alaska is it a joyous annual event to denote the day when ice in a neighbouring river, lake or harbour begins to break apart in the spring. And in the Yukon, at least, both river and romantic breakups have a weird tendency to coincide .\nKirsten Lorenz Breakup in Dawson City, Yukon. —\nCrawfish \nThis was a slur against Anglo Canadians used in some corners of Quebec. The intent of the insult is not known (Anglos eat a lot of crawfish?), but no less than Quebec premier Réne Lévesque said in interviews that the term was a feature of his Gaspé childhood.\nPat McGrath/The Ottawa Citizen Pictured: An Anglophone Canadian. —\nPeasouper \nSo in response, Canadian Anglos referred to Réne Lévesque and his friends as “ peasoupers .” These are hurtful terms, to be sure, but Canada can at least take pride that they merely seem to be based on a group’s particular food preferences. In the vast global catalogues of insults and slurs, it usually gets way worse.\n—\nBay Wop \nAnother pejorative term, but surprisingly, it has nothing to do with people of Italian heritage. Used exclusively in Newfoundland, it’s employed by urbanites to refer to the inhabitant of a coastal settlement — sort of like calling someone a “hick” or a “yokel.”\nThinkstock / Getty Italians have a point. —\nMangia-cake \nSpeaking of Italians, here is an exclusively Italian-Canadian term used as a jocular slam against non-Italian white Canadians. It means “cake eater,” and refers to how most of Canada prefers sweet white sandwich bread — in sharp contrast to the more sophisticated bread tastes of Italians.\n—\nSquare head \nThis can refer to the Canadian-designed Robertson screwdriver. Or, it can be used as an all-purpose slur against any number of white ethnicities . The darker corners of Canadian history have featured the term “square head” being hurled at Germans, Swedes, Poles or simply English Canadians.\n—\nBumper shining \nThe only term on this list exclusive to Manitoba. It refers to the apparently popular wintertime Manitoba practice of grabbing onto a passing car for a free ride . The National Post would like to take a moment to remind our readers that this is a very dangerous pursuit.\nYouTube Canadian actor Michael J. Fox demonstrates a variant of bumper shining in Back to the Future. —\nPoisoned \nThanks to their unique brand of English, Newfoundland punches far above its weight in contributions to the Dictionary of Canadianisms. This one — which has likely caused no end of confusion on safety-conscious Alberta work sites — refers to being annoyed. “I’m poisoned with the lot of ’em I am,” reads a 2009 example cited in the dictionary in which a Newfoundlander complains about the government of Danny Williams.\n—\nBush ape \nThankfully, this one’s not a racial slur. It’s a B.C. term for a logger, and “does not seem to have been derogatory,” says the dictionary . As B.C. logging terms go, it’s also notable for not containing the “f-word.”\nFile photo Some proud Canadian bush apes. A part of our heritage. —\nFrench French \nCanada, of course, proudly has our own, better, French people than the ones in Europe. Naturally, this has necessitated an Anglo term to differentiate someone who comes from Rimouski rather than from Avignon. In French-speaking areas of Canada, meanwhile, the usual term is “French from France” or “those damned French.”\n—\nIdiot string \nA string that is used to attach a possession to one’s body to prevent it from being lost . While this could conceivably refer to wallet chains or corded key holders, Canadians usually use “idiot string” to identify a length of string used to bind two mittens to one another.\nMike Beitz/Beacon Herald No idiot strings for this guy. —\nHiyu \nParticularly in the Canadian territories, English features a lot more borrowing from Aboriginal languages. While “skookum” (good) is the most well-known, parts of interior B.C. once saw heavy usage of “hiyu,” meaning “many.” “Saturday night was a hiyu success,” reads an 1899 example unearthed by dictionary editors.\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images Maybe it's what Trump has been trying to say this whole time? • Email: thopper@nationalpost.com | Twitter: TristinHopper \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:07:47.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
