Bruce Franks. William Nelson (center), of Berkeley is his alleged accomplice in the Christmas carjacking. Maurice Green is his alleged accomplice in the Franks carjacking. \nST. LOUIS • One of the carjackers who robbed a woman leaving Christmas Mass in downtown St. Louis also robbed a newly elected state legislator of his car, gun and cellphone days earlier, prosecutors allege. \nThe woman was carjacked at gunpoint at 12:50 a.m. Christmas Day as she and a friend left Mass at Christ Church Cathedral, in the 1200 block of Locust Street. \nWithin days, two men — Tavion Regans and William Nelson, both 20 — were charged with robbery, armed criminal action and tampering with a motor vehicle. \nNow authorities say Regans is one of two men who robbed State Rep. Bruce Franks Jr. at gunpoint Dec. 19 on the parking lot of the Schlafly Tap Room, 2100 Locust Street. \nRegans was already being held without bail for the Christmas Day robbery when the St. Louis circuit’s attorney filed additional charges against him on Sunday in the Franks case. Bail in the Franks robbery was set at $80,000, cash-only. \nRegans had a different accomplice in the Franks holdup, according to police. Maurice Green, also 20, was arrested Saturday and charged Sunday with first-degree robbery and armed criminal action. His bail in the Franks case is also $80,000 cash-only. \nRegans, of the 1500 block of Biddle Street, already had pending criminal cases for robbery and tampering. Green, of the 8000 block of Busiek Avenue in Berkeley, was on probation for a 2015 burglary case in St. Louis County at the time of the robbery, authorities said. \nWhen Franks was robbed, he was days away from being sworn in as a new state legislator. Franks said he had been at the Tap Room for a holiday party and was returning a phone call while sitting in his car. \n“I looked up and the guy had a gun and he told me to get out,” he said. “I got out and he pointed a gun at me and told me, ‘Get the hell out of here.’” \nFranks was unharmed in the robbery, but the robbers made off with his Toyota Camry, two cellphones and a black .40-caliber Smith and Wesson gun he stored in the console. \nFranks identified Regans, as the man who ordered him at gunpoint to get out of his car. Franks’ car was recovered the next day by Ferguson police. \nThe woman robbed after leaving Mass on Christmas told police she and a friend had walked to her Hyundai Tucson and got inside to drive home. Police say Regans and Nelson walked up and ordered the car’s owner to get out at gunpoint. Both women obliged. \nRegans and Nelson jumped into the Tucson and drove off, police say. \nHours later, Regans and Nelson were seen driving in the Tucson, police say. Police arrested them as they tried to escape. \nNelson, of the 1000 block of North 17th Street, was also charged with resisting arrest and leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:54:33.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
