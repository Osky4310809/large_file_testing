He should be a megastar, but he’s mounted one of the quietest National Player of the Year campaigns in recent memory. That’s because his Gonzaga Bulldogs play in the WCC and at such a late hour that East Coasters are usually fast asleep while Williams-Goss is on the floor. \nWhatever anonymity Williams-Goss has played under will end this weekend. He’ll lead Gonzaga into a Sweet 16 game Thursday against West Virginia (7:39 p.m. ET, TBS), and he’ll be squarely in a national spotlight. \nHis audience will like what it sees. \nWilliams-Goss has been superb. In 32 minutes per night, he’s averaged 16.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.7 steals. He’s made 90 percent of his free throws. He’s not an elite shooter from the field, where his effective field-goal percentage is a fine but ordinary 55 percent. He’s not a human highlight reel like some of the other elite point men in the field: UCLA’s Lonzo Ball, Kentucky’s Malik Monk , and Michigan’s Derrick Walton Jr. \nWilliams-Goss will grind to find efficiency, though. With free throws factored in, his true shooting percentage is an excellent 61 percent. By offensive rating, an overall efficiency measure that factors in playmaking and rebounding, he’s in the top 100 nationally. \nHe isn’t in the handful of top offensive threats in the sport, but he’s nonetheless an elite scorer who has to face top defenders all the time.\nIn the past, Gonzaga’s had great guards with serious athletic limitations Mark Few has made 18 NCAA tournaments in 18 years leading this program. In all 18, his teams have fallen short. Dumb luck plays a part in a streak like that; some years, you’ll play a bad game at the wrong time, and that’s that. But Gonzaga has always had a structural problem, too, in that it hasn’t had elite, athletic guards. \nGonzaga’s had a lot of great guards, of course. But those guards haven’t been top-level athletes. And when they’ve had to go against the four- and five-star recruits of the world in the tournament, they’ve often been overmatched. Some of them have put up decent scoring games, but the position’s been a frequent disadvantage. \nKevin Pangos was a four-year contributor and WCC player of the year in 2015. It did him no good when he lined up across from Duke’s Tyus Jones in the Elite Eight. Pangos went 2-of-8 and had four points and no assists in 40 minutes on the floor. Jones also played a full 40 minutes and had 15 and six. Pangos wasn’t quick enough to guard him or get away from him, and it was a huge factor in a 66-52 clunker.\nFew has developed a bunch of other point guards who have become good or great WCC players. Dan Dickau and Derek Raivio, the WCC’s players of the year in 2002 and 2007 respectively, come to mind. They weren’t top-flight athletes. \nThe national champion starting lead guards in those years were Maryland’s Juan Dixon and Florida’s Taurean Green. Those were athletes. That’s not a coincidence. (Maryland’s point guard was Steve Blake, but Dixon, like Gonzaga’s guards, drove the offense.) \nWilliams-Goss doesn’t have the same limitations as his predecessors He’s a former McDonald’s All-American with athleticism coming out of his ears. He can beat other athletic point guards off the dribble. He can defend whomever. Williams-Goss is a WCC player of the year whose game wears well against the best athletes, too.\nGonzaga didn’t land him out of high school. Williams-Goss spent his first two collegiate seasons playing for Lorenzo Romar’s Washington, and he was a top scorer both years. He transferred to Gonzaga after the Huskies season ended in 2015. He had to sit an NCAA-mandated eligibility year, which he apparently used to make himself a lot better.\nWilliams-Goss was good at Washington, but he’s miles better now. He had bouts with volume shooting at Washington, but his shooting splits have gotten a lot better with the Zags. Most striking is that 90 percent foul shooting, which had been in the 70s. His three-point shooting, never a great strength, is still just OK. \nHis turnover rate is a career low. His fouls called per 40 minutes is also a low, while his fouls drawn are a career high. He spends much, much more time at the foul line than he used to, so he can put his marksmanship to use. \nMy favorite part of Williams-Goss’ game is the way he draws a crowd. He’s a good ball-handler and he’s quick, and he likes to shoot from close to the basket. (He makes 55 percent of his two-point shots and draws a lot of fouls.) The prettiest thing Williams-Goss does is bend defenses into him, then kick out to one of Gonzaga’s shooters:\nThat highlight came against former team Washington, with future No. 1 NBA draft pick Markelle Fultz among the players failing to do anything about Williams-Goss. \nWilliams-Goss is the biggest reason this Gonzaga team can be different If he’s not the best player on the floor, he’s up there. He doesn’t get overwhelmed by more talented players like someone with lesser skill might.\nGonzaga has had wonderful WCC players over the years, plus a couple of NBA-caliber bigs and wings. But it hasn’t had a guard like Nigel Williams-Goss. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:10:32.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
