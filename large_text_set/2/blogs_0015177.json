If so, look no further than regular CNN contributor and perennial Democratic supporter Sally Kohn. While I happened to miss this original announcement the good folks at the New York Post highlighted a plan which Kohn tweeted out a few days ago. It’s a brilliant strategy and just what the chanting masses in the streets have been hungering for. In a few simple steps progressive activists will be able to sweep away the results of the 2016 election and install Hillary Clinton as the President of the United States. It’s fairly short, so let’s check in and see what it involves .\nStraightforward from here:\n1. Impeach Trump & Pence\n2. Constitutional crisis\n3. Call special election\n4. Ryan v Clinton\n5. President Clinton\n— Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) February 15, 2017 \n\nLast week, cable news personality Sally Kohn tweeted what she called a â€œstraightforwardâ€ plan that would eject Donald Trump and install Hillary Clinton into the presidency: â€œ1. Impeach Trump Pence; 2. Constitutional crisis; 3. Call special election; 4. Ryan v Clinton; 5. President Clinton.â€\nGenius! Is that really all there is to it? Why didn’t we think of that in 2008 or 2012?\nI assume that by now someone has corrected Sally on the error of her ways but let’s think about that for a moment. Assume hypothetically that you could come up with some rapidfire process to trump up some charges (if you’ll pardon the wording) and boot the president out of the Oval Office. Mike pence would then immediately be sworn in as the next president. Somewhere deep down inside the fire swamp of Sally’s imagination there is apparently a list of high crimes or misdemeanors which Mike pence is already guilty of. Okay, let’s just go with that. So we impeach Pence and thenâ€Ś\nAssuming that you managed this 2nd feat of impeachment so fast that President Pence would not have had time to designate a new vice president then Speaker Paul Ryan would be sworn in as president. So far so good, Sally. So now we have Paul Ryan as President of the United States and weâ€Ś Call for a special election ?\nPardon me for a moment while I flip through my handy pocket Constitution. Let’s see hereâ€Ś Nope. There doesn’t seem to be anything in here about a special election for the presidency. I suppose Hillary Clinton could run against Paul Ryan in 2020 but that doesn’t really solve your problem now does it?\nThis is apparently the sad state of affairs not only out in the streets right now but on the set of major cable news outlets. Trump Derangement Syndrome is in full swing and affecting the minds of liberals in terrible ways. While I may not agree very often with with Sally Kohn when she writes the occasional opinion piece or expounds at length on the issues of the day on CNN, I’m fairly sure that she knows that’s not how this works. That’s not how any of this works . But all she has left is her bitterness over the results of the election and her hatred of all things Trump.\nAre we really in for four straight years of this? And if so, will the replacement for Obamacare include any sort of coverage for long-term therapeutic treatment for people who have fallen prey to this affliction?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:08:29.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
