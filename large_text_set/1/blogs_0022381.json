REUTERS/Edgard Garrido – RTSWLX4 \nTrump signed the two executive orders at the Department of Homeland Security, one of them ordering construction of a wall along the roughly 3,200-kilometres U.S.-Mexico border. \nThe other order moves to strip Federal grant money from “sanctuary” states and cities, often governed by Democrats, which harbour illegal immigrants. \n“The American people are no longer going to have to be forced to subsidise this disregard for our laws,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. \nIn an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, Trump said construction on the wall would start within months, with planning starting immediately, and that Mexico would pay back to the U.S. “100 percent” of the costs. \nMexican officials have said they would not pay for the wall. \nDuring a White House briefing, Spicer referred to the wall as “a large physical barrier on the southern border”. \n“Building this barrier is more than just a campaign promise, it’s a common sense first step to really securing our porous border. \n“This will stem the flow of drugs, crime, illegal immigration into the United States,” Spicer said. \nTrump has long said that he will make Mexico pay for the wall. \n“We’ll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico. \n“I’m just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. What I’m doing is good for the United States. \n“It’s also going to be good for Mexico. We want to have a very stable, very solid Mexico,” Trump told ABC on Wednesday. \nTrump made cracking down on illegal immigration a key element of his presidential campaign, with supporters often chanting “Build the wall,” during his rallies. \nThe cost, nature and extent of the wall remain unclear. \nTrump last year put the cost at “probably eight billion dollars”, although other estimates are higher, and said the wall would span 1,600 kilometres because of the terrain of the border. \nHis plans prompted an immediate outcry from immigrant advocates who said Trump was jeopardising the rights and freedoms of millions of people.
