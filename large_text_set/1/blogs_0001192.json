She opened with a successful rendition of “Auld Lang Syne,” but when the music started playing for her next song, “Emotions,” she announced: “We can’t hear,” apparently waiting in vain for technical support as the music played on. While her background dancers carried on as normal, the star gave up on singing, sashayed around the stage and threw out some commentary and explanation: “We didn’t have a sound check, but it’s New Year’s, baby. It’s OK, guys.” And later: “I want a holiday, too, can I not have one? I’m trying to be a good sport here.”\nHer final song, “We Belong Together,” went slightly more as planned—because she was lip-syncing, as she seemed to admit at the beginning when she said, “This is the album version.” She could plainly be seen to lower her microphone and stop moving her mouth at points during the song, though the vocals continued.\n“It just don’t get any better,” she said before leaving the stage.\nThe singer later tweeted about the situation:\nShit happens 😩 Have a happy and healthy new year everybody!🎉 Here's to making more headlines in 2017 😂 pic.twitter.com/0Td8se57jr \n— Mariah Carey (@MariahCarey) January 1, 2017 \nFans and critics alike also took to social media to comment on the performance:\nMariah Carey is 2016\n— Spike (@loudspike) January 1, 2017 \nCc: @MariahCarey https://t.co/ZdjnwkTDlS \n— Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) January 1, 2017 \n2016 has claimed another victim.
