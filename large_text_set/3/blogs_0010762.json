Some people are like, ‘Oh, there’s one person for everyone,’” says Hartley, who adds, “But when you meet that one person, you realize like What the hell have I been doing my whole life? This is the person .” \nHartley, who is father to adolescent daughter Isabella Justice, dished to PEOPLE about his and 35-year-old Stause’s wedding in October. \n“I think we’re going to do an intimate wedding,” he said. “We’re just starting now, and we’re realizing that even when you just start and you give yourselves tons of time to do it, you’re still behind. You’re always behind. You feel like you are. I might just hand it off to someone.” \nHarry airs weekdays (check local listings).
