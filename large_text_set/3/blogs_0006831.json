He is the captain and is working very well and helping me a lot in the changing room to translate the right message. He is an important player for us” \nTerry has only managed four Premier League appearances this season but has been a regular in the FA Cup. \nChelsea take on Manchester United on Monday night in the cup - but Conte has yet to decide on Terry's involvement.
