It will be covered,” he said. \nThe creation of the CITF came in the wake of discovery that rogue policemen kidnapped and murdered Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo. The Korean was kidnapped in Pampanga and killed inside the PNP headquarters at Camp Crame. \nInitial investigation showed Jee had been dead by the time his wife paid his captors P5 million ransom for his release.   \nDela Rosa would later say some members of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) were involved in Jee’s kidnap-slay. \nHe reassigned one company or about 70 Special Action Force (SAF) commandos to serve as CITF enforcement unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:50:48.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
