I stopped covering the Twitter feed… \n“It is an unusual thing that the White House and its chief spokespeople have been called out saying stuff that’s not true over and over and over again,” she said. “It’s the petty stuff but it’s also important stuff that they’ve not told the truth about.” \nShe hosted Kellyanne Conway on her program back in December , but describes talking to her as conversing with “a pro-Trump political operative” as opposed to a White House official. \nMore generally, she says that when surrogates are caught lying, “we no longer go to that person for factual information.” \nMaddow talked about this approach to her broadcast last month , and a bump in viewership in the Trump era recently gave Maddow her best ratings week since 2008 . \nShe also weighed in on the state of the conservative media and how telling consumers “you can’t trust anybody else” has been “taken to a high art at Fox.” \nYou can read the full interview here . \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:17:50.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
