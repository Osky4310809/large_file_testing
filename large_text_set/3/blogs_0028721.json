It’s one of the reasons we love turning to video games, after all. But sometimes, the feedback loop goes all the way back around like a JT song, and games start simulating the realest aspects of real life in real ways. And sometimes, companies like Astragon and TML make simulators that you had no idea you needed. Here are some very real gaming simulators with very real fan bases. American Truck Simulator \n(source) \nIf you like the unimaginable stress and impossibility of a normal sleep schedule, then American Truck Simulator is for you. Cruise down the highways and byways of the midwest as you struggle to keep control of a bajillion-pound semi, careening into other cars and tanking your finances. Guys, I can’t get behind the wheel of my mom’s SUV without being compelled to buy four different types of insurance, American Truck Simulator is a shade too much for me. Farming Simulator \n(source) \nAnd then there’s the multi-installment Farming Simulator ! Now you can, once again, simulate the stress of a real-life lifestyle when you get home to unwind in front of your PS4. Now get on out there and pull your farm equipment out of the Dark Ages and into 2014! Or 2015! Or any year in which this game has legitimately been released. How fitting that we’re still dealing with the psychological torment of Daylight Saving Time. (Or is it the end of Daylight Saving? Would you believe me if I told you both? Or neither?) Goat Simulator \n(source) \nThe tongue-in-cheek Goat Simulator is NOT an Astragon product, but rather an uncanny parody in which you can drag objects around the virtual environment with your raspy lil’ goat’s tongue. Go out and support this with your dollars, because I’m not sure I’m going to want to live in a world where Goat Simulator 2018 isn’t a real thing. I need to know how they live! City Bus Simulator \n(source) \nThis bad boy simulates a real route traveling through New York, including Times Square. Much like American Truck Simulator , it will prepare you for heart-stopping stress as you navigate a cumbersome vehicle through treacherous terrain, and, hey, deal with struggling Internet writers who beg you to let them on and waive the fare, but choose to be a HUGE JERK-FACE and make them late for work (uh, citation needed). Street Cleaning Simulator \n(source) \nI need this in my life, if only so I can understand why I need to wake up at 4AM to move my car, just so this big noisy broom on wheels can kick all of the leaves up onto the sidewalk. Do you get bonus points for waking up as many elderly people as possible? Could we just throw all of these sims into a big ol’ pot and get American Street Cleaning Goat Simulator ? \nYo dawg, do you want a simulator simulator so you can sim while you sim?
