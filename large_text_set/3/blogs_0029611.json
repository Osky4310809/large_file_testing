This one was a rematch of these two powerhouse programs from last December, with the Wildcats winning, 103-100, in that one. UNC won this second round of the matchup in a 75-73 thriller of a game. \nThe first half of this one looked to be just as exciting as the first game between these two, but less high-scoring, with the Tar Heels heading to the locker room with a 37-33 lead. In the second half, things remained close throughout. One of the biggest storylines of the night was how the Tar Heels’ defense did a masterful job containing true freshmen De’Aaron Fox and Malik Monk . The two combined for just 25 points on the night.\nBut with the Wildcats’ two stars being limited by UNC’s defense, the offense got some quality production from Edrice Adebayo , who finished with 13 points, seven rebounds, and two assists on the night. Isaac Humphries also came off the bench and scored 12 points.\nThe second half of this game did not disappoint.\nKentucky’s largest lead of the game came with just under six minutes left, at 64-59 off a Humphries jumper. UNC was able to regain a one-point 65-64 lead inside the three-minute mark, and free throws put it up by three with less than two to go.\nUNC capitalized on a missed UK possession, and was able to go up 69-64 with two minutes left on a nice shot from Joel Berry II , who was playing with a sprained ankle he sustained earlier in the game. He finished with 11 points. \nKentucky got the ball back with 1:12 left, but Monk missed a three-pointer, forcing the Wildcats to start sending UNC to the line. Fox made a three-pointer to pull the Wildcats within four with 47 seconds to go, and UNC was unable to inbound the ball within five seconds to give UK another shot. Monk drained a three to pull within one, but a miscue on defense allowed Jackson to make an easy bucket on a long pass to get the Tar Heels back to a three-point lead.\nMiraculously, Kentucky was able to drain a three-pointer with 10 seconds left, but Luke Maye made a quick jumper with two seconds left to give the Tar Heels the 75-73 victory.\nJackson finished with 19 points for the Tar Heels.\nFor the UNC, this will be its second straight Final Four appearance, having advanced last year to the national title. The Tar Heels will face the No. 7 South Carolina Gamecocks, who beat Florida in the Elite Eight, next Saturday.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:47:11.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
