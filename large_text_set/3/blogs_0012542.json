Both have previously said they are legal gun owners, and that Michigan law allows them to carry their weapon openly, including in a police station. \nThe men allege that police knew of their arrival because of a fake Facebook account that was used to track their activities. Officers reportedly had their guns drawn before Baker and Vreeland reached the precinct.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:16:58.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
