He will be the third opener in the 16-man squad. The southpaw had scored 849 runs in 14 innings at an average of 65.30 - which included four centuries and three half-centuries in the recently concluded Ranji Trophy season. \nWriddhiman Saha, who is fit and in form following the match-winning double century in the Irani Cup has returned to the side. His inclusion has led to the ouster of Parthiv Patel, who had scored a match-winning century and led Gujarat to a win in the Ranji Trophy final. \nAjinkya Rahane too has returned to the side, while Shikhar Dhawan does not find a place in the team. R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra and Jayant Yadav are the four spinners, while Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya are the four pacers. Mohammed Shami, who is undergoing rehabilitation for a knee injury, does not find a spot. He has been out of action since the third Test against England. \nThe selection committee meeting which was set to start at 12 noon, was delayed by six hours after Amitabh Chaudhary was asked not to convene the selection committee meeting by Chief of Committee of Administrators Vinod Rai. \nThis will be the first time Bangladesh will play a Test in India. \nSquad: V irat Kohli, KL Rahul, Murali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Wriddhiman Saha, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Jayant Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Amit Mishra, Abhinav Mukund, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Karun Nair, Hardik Pandya. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T15:35:21.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
