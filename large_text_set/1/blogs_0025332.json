PUBLISHED: 12:25, Tue, Jan 31, 2017 | UPDATED: 13:09, Tue, Jan 31, 2017 \nBrexit Secretary David Davis kicked off two days of debate on the second reading in the House of Commons of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. \nIf passed, the Bill will hand Theresa May the authority to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and start EU divorce talks. \nShe has vowed to invoke Article 50 by the end of March. \nBeginning proceedings, Mr Davis said: \"This Bill responds directly to the Supreme Court judgement and seeks to honour the commitment the Government gave to honour the outcome of the referendum held on June 23 last year. \n\"It is not a Bill about whether or not the UK should leave the EU, or indeed how it should do so. \n“It is simply about Parliament empowering the Government to implement a decision already made, a point of no return already passed. \n“We asked the people of the UK if they wanted to leave the EU; they decided they did. \n\"So at the core of this bill lies a very simple question: do we trust the people or not?\" Related articles How the SNP, Lib Dems & Labour rebels will try to block Brexit \nThe Brexit Secretary told MPs the \"democratic mandate is clear\" for them to pass the Bill. \nHe said: \"The electorate voted for a Government to give them a referendum. Parliament then voted to hold a referendum, the people then voted in that referendum and we are now honouring the result of the referendum as we said we would. \n\"This is the most straightforward possible Bill necessary to enact the referendum result and respect the Surpeme Court judgement.\" \nMr Davis also reminded MPs the House of Commons has \"already overwhelmingly passed a motion to support the triggering of Article 50 by March 31\" in a vote last year. \nSpeaker John Bercow revealed 99 backbenchers are hoping to speak in the debate today alone. PA David Davis opened the Article 50 debate today We asked the people of the UK if they wanted to leave the EU; they decided they did David Davis \nThe 133-word Bill follows the Supreme Court's ruling last week the Prime Minister must first gain the consent of MPs and peers before beginning EU exit negotiations. \nThe Liberal Democrats, SNP and rebel Labour MPs will this week introduce five wrecking amendments aimed at derailing the Bill. \nEach of these amendments will be debated over the next two days, with votes to be held tomorrow. \nBut it has been reported Government ministers and Tory MPs have also been told to stay in the House of Commons until midnight tonight amid fears of an “ambush” late-night vote by pro-Remain MPs. \nLabour will only try to introduce their planned seven official amendments at a later stage in the process and not this week. \nParty leader Jeremy Corbyn has ordered his MPs not to block Brexit but could face a rebellion by up to 100 MPs. \nIf the Bill survives unscathed, it will return to the House of Commons for a third reading and a final vote on February 8, when it will then pass to the House of Lords.
