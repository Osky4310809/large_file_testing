So why's the Black Lives Matter movement involved?\nIt's not, of course. But that didn't stop a racist hashtag suggesting as much from trending.\nOn Tuesday, Chicago police arrested three 18-year-olds and a 24-year-old, including the woman who allegedly filmed and posted a 30-minute video on her Facebook account showing the kidnapping and torturing of a white man with an intellectual disability. The four accused attackers are black. On Thursday, the group was charged with a hate crime for the attack.\nSEE ALSO: Trevor Noah has a lesson on how to talk to conservatives\nIn the video, the alleged kidnappers can be heard shouting expletives about white people and Donald Trump, as the victim is tied up and beaten.\nWith the video online and accessible for some time before Facebook removed it, the clip quickly turned into fodder for white supremacists, alt-right trolls, and racists. Tweets about so-called reverse racism and demands to charge the group with a hate crime came swiftly, and proliferated as such. By Wednesday night, the misleading hashtag #BLMKidnapping ‚Äîwhich includes the acronym for the Black Lives Matter movement‚Äîwas picking up steam.\nThe hashtag incorrectly implied that the kidnappers are connected to Black Lives Matter, and the idea was pushed by prominent Twitter users such as Infowars editor Paul Joseph Watson. The site, known for promoting fake news and conspiracy theories, ran a story claiming the attack was fueled by \"anti-Trump hatred.\"\n#BLMKidnapping is the hashtag to get this story trending. https://t.co/gNaBrifiLm\n‚Äî Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) January 5, 2017\nSome of the earlier tweets Wednesday started to link the attack to Black Lives Matter. What looks like the first use of the hashtag simply linked back to the Infowars story.\n#BLMKidnapping\nBlack Lives Matter once again showing it is a terrorist org like ISIS. https://t.co/WCDFkD5iyb\n‚Äî Philip Schuyler (@FiveRights) January 4, 2017\nChicago police have already debunked any connection between the activist group and kidnappers, despite prominent alt-right social media users pushing the narrative. Former Chicago police officer Dimitri Roberts told CNN this is about hate, not race: \"For folks to talk about 'this is somehow connected to Black Lives Matter' is absolutely the wrong way to look at this,\" said Roberts. \"And we cannot respond to hate with hate. It's just going to perpetuate the cycle.\"\nRemember the #blmkidnapping every time some journalist lies about my white advocacy organization and calls it a hate group.\n‚Äî Richard üê∏ Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) January 5, 2017\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has come down hard against the false information spreading through the hashtag. The local Black Lives Matter Chicago chapter reacted with disgust to the countless posts pulling the organization into the heinous crime.\nSome people are disgusting. Your making jokes!?What happened to the teenager is terrible & tragic. However it has nothing to do with BLM. pic.twitter.com/f7qit5Ym6z\n‚Äî BLMChicago (@BLMChi) January 5, 2017\nOn the main Black Lives Matter Facebook account, the group posted on Thursday: \"We condemn this behavior,\" reiterating the message behind the movement as \"less violence, not more.\"\nIt goes without saying that the actions being branded by the far-right as the \"BLM Kidnapping\" have nothing to do w/ the movement.\n‚Äî deray mckesson (@deray) January 5, 2017\nThis isn't the first time Black Lives Matter has had to deal with the efforts of those opposing it to create a false narrative connecting them to violence. It's not even the first time this week .\nOver the weekend, the group was blamed for the increase in shootings in Chicago last year, and a staged home invasion last year in Massachusetts was made to look like the work of Black Lives Matter activists. Meanwhile, conservative groups and others continue to label the organization as a hate group, and a modern-day version of the Ku Klux Klan .\nIn the mainstream imagination of today, anything horrible done by Black people will be associated with BLM. Funny how oppression works.\n‚Äî BLMChicago (@BLMChi) January 5, 2017\nThese instances, like the kidnapping hashtag, attempt to diminish the organization's efforts to promote equity for the black community, and usually leave fringe groups squabbling over pro-white and anti-black sentiments. It's a new threshold in the way social media networks are being used, now, to create agitprop campaigns‚Äîregardless of truth‚Äîand one we'll likely get used to seeing before too long.\nBONUS: Faraday Future just unveiled a super fast Tesla competitor ‚Äî here's what it looks like", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/816908247261024256", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/us/black-lives-matter-chicago-facebook-live-beating/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/blmkidnapping?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=refgoogle", "https://t.co/gNaBrifiLm", "https://twitter.com/Charles_Littles/status/816788200094101504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.facebook.com/ChicagoPoliceDepartment/posts/10153926342406534", "https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/884_RC03/embed_loader.js", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/10/09/a-professor-is-under-fire-after-saying-black-lives-matter-is-as-racist-as-the-kkk/?utm_term=.ba3fa0219d30", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/MSMfgnzs.jpg", "https://t.co/f7qit5Ym6z", "https://twitter.com/BLMChi/status/816835687119015940", "https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/816807919924690944", "https://twitter.com/FiveRights/status/816793759274979330", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/blmkidnapping?src=hash", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/us/chicago-facebook-live-beating/index.html?sr=twCNN010517chicago-facebook-live-beating0347PMVODtopLink&linkId=33051321", "http://time.com/4550455/police-officer-wife-fake-robbery-black-lives-matter/", "https://t.co/WCDFkD5iyb", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLMKidnapping?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/BLMChi/status/817120348189691908", "https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/MSMfgnzs.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/deray/status/816991081837580288", "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/3/black-lives-matter-blamed-for-spike-in-chicago-sho/", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/12/01/trevor_noah_and_tomi_lahren_talk_black_lives_matter_race_and_colin_kaepernick.html"], "published": "2017-01-06T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:02:14.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
