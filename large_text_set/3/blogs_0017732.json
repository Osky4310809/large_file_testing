He’s defended CNN multiple times after attacks from President Trump , said “there’s been a lot of lying” from the White House , and just this week said he’s stopped quoting Kellyanne Conway “because, well, history.” \nAnd now today, Smith said on-air that Fox News cannot confirm “commentary” by the network’s own Judge Andrew Napolitano on British intel agency GCHQ surveilling Trump for Barack Obama . \nThis earned Smith some plaudits from MSNBC competitor Joe Scarborough : \"Fox News know of no evidence of any kind.\"Shep kicks ass. Full stop. https://t.co/wNEwwinlH4 \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 17, 2017 \nScarborough too has been alarmed at the White House over this new claim: It is beneath the dignity of the White House to churn out fraudulent conspiracy theories that trash our special relationship with Britain. https://t.co/fiqpxEA1wJ \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 17, 2017 First Great Britain. Now Germany. All to defend a lie that the entire world knows is a lie. https://t.co/SfwUXblkPW \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 17, 2017 Of course you don't. Because it's only our most important alliance, after all. https://t.co/rxzxYnndQV \n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 17, 2017 \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:29:20.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
