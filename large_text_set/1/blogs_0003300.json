Blah. Blah. Donald Trump was quick to lash out after reporting made clear that the current plan for building his precious wall involves Republican lawmakers allocating taxpayer dollars to fund it. x \nThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! \nCaitlin McNeal writes : \nUnder Trump's current plan for building a border wall, Congress will use existing legislation authorizing border fences to appropriate funds for additional building along the border, according to the Associated Press . Congress would not pass a new bill authorizing a wall. \nTrump surrogate Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) also told CNN Friday morning that Trump will negotiate reimbursement with Mexico. \nYeah, we'll believe that when we see it. Just one more lie they’re spinning in hopes that the American people will forget about it. Like that press conference Trump promised proving that his wife, Melania Trump, didn't evade immigration laws. Never happened. Or that press conference detailing how he'll cut ties with his businesses so he can focus on the presidency. Still waiting. Or how about a look at those tax returns so we know the full breadth of his conflicts of interest? Never gonna happen. \nCan’t wait for that “foolproof” plan to defeat ISIS. \n#MAGA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T20:41:49.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
