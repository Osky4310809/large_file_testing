(Courtesy KWGN) \nTom Green, one of Denver’s longest-tenured broadcasters and one with a particularly loyal following, will leave KWGN-Channel 2 and “Daybreak” when his contract expires at the end of May. \n“It’s just time to change my vista,” Green said. “I don’t have a plan.” \nThe anchor known for his droll style will stay in Denver and will likely remain in broadcasting, he said. He has had conversations about a return to sportscasting. “I’m not retiring.” \nGreen calculated he has anchored 4,000 “Daybreaks.” That has meant setting his alarm for 2:30 a.m. for 16 years to be on set for the weekday 5-9 a.m. show. “I keep hearing about Denver traffic …,” he said. It’s not something he encounters at that hour. \nHe previously worked for ESPN, ABC and Fox Sports. Locally he was sports anchor for more than 13 years at KUSA and for three years at KMGH, transitioning to news anchor when he joined KWGN. He also was a radio host for KKFN-AM. In recent years he has publicly pondered his next career move .
