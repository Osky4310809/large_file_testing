Early in December, Politico reported that Trump explained in his interview for TIME as Person of the Year that he said he would “work something out” with the so-called “Dreamers.” \nRegardless, the actions of those three Republican senators is outrageous. They are trying to undercut Trump’s agenda — and they don’t even know what it is yet! \nWhile Trump can — and should — expect some opposition from Congress with various parts of his agenda, what these three senators are doing is pure obstructionism. It would be one thing if they were crafting this legislation after Trump stated he would deport the Dreamers, but Trump has made no such statement. \nIf Graham, Flake and Murkowski are going to act like this before Trump is even the president, what will they do when he actually tries to enact his agenda?
