I'm thankful to [Burnley manager] Sean Dyche for the work he's done with me and the faith he's put in me -- that's what has got me to where I am today.\" \nFormer Manchester United teammate Ryan Giggs said Keane \"didn't put a foot wrong\" against World Cup holders Germany. \nHe was the first outfield Burnley player to be capped by the Three Lions since 1974 and said: \"It's a dream come true on a personal level. \n\"Obviously it's a shame about the result in the end, but I thought the lads played really well.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
