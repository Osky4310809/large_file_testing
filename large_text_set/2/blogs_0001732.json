Last year, it launched a new product called Reserve for Restaurants , allowing those restaurants to manage all their tables, maintain a database of customer information and accept reservations on their own websites. \nNext up, according to co-founder and CEO Greg Hong, is the launch of a new, “best in class” table management product in the second quarter of 2017. \nIt might look like Reserve’s focus has shifted from its dining app to restaurant software (and certainly its business model has shifted from charging diners per reservation to charging restaurants a flat monthly fee), but Hong said it’s all part of the same vision. He admitted that first, he “didn’t fully have have my arms wrapped around that alignment with those restaurant communities,” which is why the company’s put such a focus on building out tools for those restaurants. But he also said Reserve has always been a “two-sided marketplace” that needs to serve both restaurants and diners.

Reserve says it has already been used by more than 500 restaurants to seat nearly 9 million diners. \nReserve was incubated at Expa, the “startup studio” created by StumbleUpon and Uber co-founder Garrett Camp, and the relationship continues, with Expa Capital leading the Series B. First Round, Human Ventures (a firm created by Reserve co-founder Joe Marchese) and others also participated in the new funding.
