But the country I encountered in the summer of 1970 is all but unrecognizable now. In a fit of cultural enervation, social ennui, and just plain suicidal stupidity, it was among the first Western countries to throw open its doors to the avant-garde of Islam, and is now paying the price. So with the Dutch elections now looming, the question is: can the tide of Muslim social conquest be reversed?\nThe question is precipitated by the extraordinary sight of riots in Rotterdam this weekend when the Dutch government forbade the Turkish minister of family affairs from landing in Holland in order to openly campaign among Holland's Turkish \"emigrant\" community on behalf of Turkish strongman's Erdogan latest power grab, which is coming up for a vote on April 16. Naturally, she simply snuck across the border from Germany into the Netherlands, but the Dutch somehow managed enough backbone to block her.\nPolice using water cannon, horses and dogs moved in to disperse the crowds after several hours of demonstrations on Saturday evening. Protesters hit back, throwing rocks at the police, while hundreds of cars jammed the streets blaring their horns.\nTensions tipped over into violence after a day of fast-moving events, triggered when Turkey's family affairs minister Sayan Kaya was stopped from attending the rally by being expelled from the Netherlands. Ms Kaya could be seen in images on Dutch NOS television appearing to argue with officers about the situation.\nEarlier, Dutch authorities also refused permission for foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to land in the city, saying he was not welcome to campaign for the referendum. In response, Mr Erdogan accused the Dutch, who were once under Nazi occupation, of being \" the vestiges of Nazis \".\nTo which a Dutch official replied: \"It is a crazy remark, of course. But I understand they are angry, but this is of course way out of line.\" If that's the best riposte the Dutch government can muster, they're going to need a lot more riot police.\nFour planned Turkish rallies in Austria and one in Switzerland have also been cancelled in the dispute. The diplomatic row comes ahead of the Netherlands going to the polls on Wednesday for a parliamentary election, where far-right politician Geert Wilders is set to make big gains.\nFatma Betul Sayan Kaya, Turkey's Minister of Family Affairs (AP Photo)\n\"Far-right\" is the far-left media's redefinition of what used to be called \"patriotism\" or simply \"cultural self-preservation.\" The international Left, of course, can't have that -- it interferes with the whole Frankfurt School/communist mission to destroy the West by undermining its faith in its own institutions, and then using those institutions against it. This movement has long employed \"open borders\" as part of its strategy, couching it in liberal pieties about \"the free movement of peoples in search of a better life.\" A better life, perhaps -- but for how long? And at whose expense?\nhttps://pjmedia.com/michaelwalsh/2017/03/12/holland-the-canary-in-the-european-coal-mine/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159403768X", "http://news.sky.com/story/dutch-riot-police-break-up-turkish-protest-in-rotterdam-10799324", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/michaelwalsh/user-content/43/files/2017/03/AP_17071366755669-300x210.jpg", "http://news.sky.com/story/who-is-geert-wilders-and-will-he-become-dutch-pm-10774387", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/michaelwalsh/user-content/43/files/2017/03/AP_17071366755669.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-13T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T02:39:57.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
