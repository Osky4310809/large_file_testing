It's going to be tough.\" \nBrewman posted a video of Nye freerunning in Paris days before he died. \nJacob says he knew Nye when they first started freerunning together, but says he's not doing it any more. \n\"When I found out what happened I was inconsolable,\" he says. \n\"He knew everyone and everyone he knew saw him as their best friend. It's heartbreaking. \n\"Nye was probably the most positive and the most outgoing person I've met in my life. \n\"He was always jumping around - he had probably the biggest flip gap of anyone I know. He could flip further than anyone I know. \n\"He would make it look so easy because he had such a big jump - he would always pull off the sketchiest things. \n\"He loved to travel. He was always going all over the world. \n\"He left an imprint on pretty much everyone he ever met.\" \nA statement posted on Brewman's Facebook page paid tribute to him. \n\"Nye was an incredible human being who was always up for anything, he experienced things in his short life, that many won't experience in their life times. \n\"He was always up for anything, and he always gave a positive outlook to any situation. \n\"He inspired so many people through his enthusiastic lifestyle and the assisted creation of Brewman. \n\"He was the type of guy who had no regrets in his life and lived every day like it was his last.\" \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:40:10.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
