What’s involved? Let the man tell you himself. \nMen’s Health: What’s your gym routine like? \nTony Kanaan: I always do a full body workout but basically I go to the gym three times a week, four times a week will be chest and back and some abs and then I do some specific for my neck. The other days will be shoulders. \nDo you have a trainer? \nI have two coaches, I have my triathlon and cardio coach and I have my strength coach, which are two different people. We usually focus on whatever part of my body I want to make better or whatever part I feel is weaker. \nWhat part of your body do you think is weakest right now? \nI would say my shoulders are my consistent problem just because they are really beat up and used up. I have to be careful, so we do a lot of stretching, a lot of massages, a lot of physio to keep maintaining and not hurting. \nIs there a meal plan that you’re on to complement that? \nMy coach is also a nutritionist. I did a metabolic test in India, and after that it was easy. I have an app on my phone that anyone can use, it’s called MyFitnessPal. The way it works is, my calorie intake is 60/90. Before I eat anything I check, and if it looks like it’s going to screw up a lot of my day I either get something else or eat a smaller portion. \nDo you restrict eating or can you pretty much eat anything? \nI can eat everything. I can have ice cream, I can have cake, but let’s say you have a piece of chocolate cake and it’s going to be 600 calories. I have to make sure that for the rest of the day I only eat 1,000. Let’s say I ate it for breakfast. So the rest of the day I have to control my portions to not beat the 1,690 calories that I have to adhere to. It’s pretty cool because when people diet they deprive themselves of something they really want. What they don’t understand is you can have everything you want, but at some point you’re going to have to either reduce or you’re going to go over. \nWith this structure of caloric limits, do you get granular about how many of those calories should come from protein versus how many calories should be from fats? \nYes, yes of course. My breakdown per day is 33 percent carbs, 37 percent fat and 47 percent protein. I need more carbs because of all the working out I do but mostly protein, and then fat because your body needs it. \nYou’re pretty tuned in. Can you tell something is out of whack before you even look at the app? \nFrom the day I got this app, I weighed my food for the first six months. But now I know the portions. I know exactly what to order. When we travel a lot and go someplace to eat, I get rice or a carb and a protein, I can eyeball it and know exactly how much to eat. I don’t have to bring a scale. I never deprive myself of eating anything. Chris Trotman / Getty Images \nDo you take supplements? \nProtein shakes, some gels during my workouts and electrolytes. My favorite protein bar is called Combat. As far as protein shakes, it’s called FormulaX, I tasted a bunch and it’s the one I prefer. And for gels I always use the GU gels. Salt caramel is my favorite. Protein shakes are recovery. Gels are during and the bars are a snack between meals. Breakfast and lunch, I have a meal between, I have a protein bar or a protein shake or something like that. \nTomorrow you’re going to be in a 24 hour race. What will you eat? \nI’ll have a nice breakfast. Probably have egg whites with some Ezekiel bread. Three egg whites with a little bit of salt, so I don’t cramp when I sweat, and some greek yogurt. Before the race I’ll have some chicken or any sort of protein. I’m not starting in the race so I’m fine. I treat my lifestyle as if I’m racing every day, so I don’t have to change anything. And I would never do anything different than I haven’t done in the past on race day. People have that mentality. If it works when I work out for four hours a day why isn’t it going to work out for a 24 hour race? \nFair enough. How many pounds of sweat do you lose during a given race? \nIn IndyCar, 4 to 5 pounds per race. Here, in endurance racing, I’ve never really measured. Because we used to weigh ourselves before and after. \nWhat’s more mentally demanding: IndyCar or endurance racing? \nThey’re different. But mentally I would say IndyCar is a lot more stressful. It’s intense because things are happening a lot quicker, especially when you’re travelling at 217 mph. Here in endurance racing, the top speed on the Ford GT is 180, but the average speed in an IndyCar can be 220. In endurance races, it’s more the focus. You have to be on-point for such a long period of time. \nYou’ll do three hours in the car then six hours of rest followed by three more hours of driving. How do you stay mentally sharp in your second stint and your third stint? \nI have a stationary bike in the bus so I’ll do that for 10 minutes just to wake everything up then I’ll go get back on the track. \nDuring the off-season, what kinds of speed tests do you do? Do you do hand-eye coordination? \nWe have the hand-eye coordination with slapping lights on a big board. We do that at the gym for fun. It’s a tool but I do it more for fun. We drive quite a bit. Nothing’s going to simulate better than the race car what you need to do. Cyclists, what do they do, train on the bike. Runners run. We drive the cars. \nWhen you’re in the middle of a triathlon, there is a lot of time for your mind to wander, how do you stay focused there? \nA triathlon is different. You’re suffering, and it’s only you. I’m not depending on the equipment. If I don’t pedal hard on my bicycle, I’m not going to go any quicker. I started triathlon to train my mind for the racing. Because that is only you. You have to focus. You have to stick to it. If you’re on the bike and you’re dying after three miles, but you have to go 80, you have to pace yourself. And that’s what keeps you focused. You have to check yourself, make sure you’re not going too fast so you don’t bonk by mile 20. I know my numbers, I have to follow that. It’s the preparation, can’t go over 80 percent of my max power so I don’t die at mile 20. \nYou do triathlons to help with training? \nYes, I did the ironman in Kona. I’ve done probably 9 70.3’s which is a half-Ironman. I’ve done them all over, in San Diego, Brasil, Miami, plenty in Miami, and I did Kona in 2011, which is the full Ironman. \nWatch Kanaan return to the asphalt during the first race of the 2017 IndyCar series, The Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, this Sunday at 12:30pm on ABC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:57:55.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
