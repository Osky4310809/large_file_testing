Christmas has been replaced with Marijuana Christmas: In areas where marijuana is legal, a marked shift from celebrating traditional Christmas to Marijuana Christmas has been noted. The two holidays are exactly the same, except that Marijuana Christmas celebrates the birth of Marijuana Jesus. \n2. In California, more than 40 million trees have been chopped down since legalization to produce paper for Doonesbury anthologies: From Red Rascals War to Tee Time In Berzerkistan , the billions of wry political cartoons needed to satisfy Californians post-legalization have led to rampant deforestation and ecological mayhem. \n3.

But it was still surprising to see just how many crabs were passing around a joint on the beach once marijuana was legalized in Washington state.
