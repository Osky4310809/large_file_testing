We’re just built for this. The truth is, even before kids, we push each other until there’s no room left to give as far as work. Sometimes to tears.” \nYeah, they sometimes end up lying in the fetal position in the bathtub or hiding in the closet eating Thin Mints, but that’s to be expected. The whole thing is just fodder for the songwriting. The fans have come to expect a certain sound from a Dollyrots album and the pair is happy to provide that, but the subject matter has always been intensely personal. And while there are no songs overtly about parenting, relationships are always a big inspiration, as with songs on the new Whiplash Splash album like “Squeeze Me” and “Babbling Idiot.” \n“Musically we’re the same band we’ve always been,” Ogden says. “We’re just a little bit less of afraid of going out of genre. We have an amazing fan base that expects a Dollyrots record. If we want to make different music, it’s not gonna be the Dollyrots. It’ll be a different project that has a different sound and different influences.” \nAnother song on the new album, “Just Because I’m Blonde,” deals with the misogyny that Ogden regularly faces. While the pair is dismayed by what has been happening in the country post-election, the album was written before life under Trump began. Perhaps that’s why the album closes with a cover of Katrina & the Waves’“Walking on Sunshine.” \nBoth musicians are delighted that they were able to write Whiplash Splash devoid of any depression and anxiety brought about by the new administration. “If we’d been halfway through writing and recording the new record, and then the election happened, it would be like two different records,” Cabezas says. “On the other hand, it’s almost better to put out a record like this because it acts as the neutralizer. This is a happy record. We feel like it can be an antidote. People come listen to it, and they can escape in it. There’s nothing wrong with fulfilling that role. Anti-Flag is awesome because of what they do, but we’re not Anti-Flag.” \nThe new album is tremendous. It’s also typical Dollyrots fare, sugary sweet and blessed with the catchiest of melodies, with a backdrop of dirty riffs. It’s the classic “ice cream and barbed wire” approach to songwriting, and it’s served The Dollyrots well for 17 years. The record was financed using fan pledges, so the band felt a massive level of responsibility to produce something great.
