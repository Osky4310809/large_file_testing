Health experts, parents hit out at Wamberal Public School’s ban on birthday cakes Matt Taylor, Central Coast Gosford Express Advocate February 13, 2017 6:33pm \nA CENTRAL Coast primary school has taken a big slice of fun out of classrooms by banning the much-loved birthday cake, experts and parents say. \nIn a move aimed at reducing childhood obesity, Wamberal Public School has told parents in its latest newsletter to “not send in birthday cakes for students to share within the class”. \nBut experts say the fun police have gone too far. media_camera Wamberal Public School has told parents to not send in birthday cakes to class. Picture: Peter Clark \n“Banning, I believe, is not the key. Education and information is the key,” Leticia Campos, a senior dietitian with Nutrition Australia, said. \n“If the school wants to address unhealthy birthday cakes, one way to go would be educate parents and carers about healthier options. For example, cakes with no icing, use wholemeal flour instead of white, try chocolate cake using cocoa powder, and fruit cakes and fruit muffins are also good options­. \n“Not all cakes are unhealthy. It’s just a matter of choosing healthier versions­.” \nParents say a great school tradition is being killed off. media_camera Central Coast P&C spokeswoman Sharryn Brownlee outside Wamberal Public School, which has put a stop to birthday cakes in classrooms.

Parents also send their children to school to learn how to share, have empathy for others, and develop broader social skills. \n“And by banning birthday cakes, it takes away some fun moments of sharing­.” \nA spokesman from the NSW Department of Education said parents had been consulted before the school made its cake-cutting call. \n“After recent concerns expressed by some parents about the special dietary requirements of their children and teachers’ inability to determine cake ingredients, the (Wamberal) principal has asked — not mandated — that families refrain from sending birthday cakes to school,” he said. media_camera The latest Wamberal Public School newsletter reveals the ban on birthday cakes. \nOther schools around the region, including Terrigal Public, allow cakes in its classrooms to celebrate special occasions, but under strict conditions. \nOne parent said Wamberal Public’s call to kill off cakes for its 700 students was “over the top” and questioned whether children’s lunch boxes would be the next target. \n“Banning cake altogether is a shame for the kids as that is one of the most exciting days in the year for them,” the mother, who did not want to be named, said. \n“And what’s next? Will lunch boxes get checked?” \nOne of the Coast’s best cake makers, Kyla Daniels, said while it would only take a small cut out of her business, “it’s really sad for the kids”. media_camera Kyla Daniels with one of her amazing baby elephant cakes.

It’s about balance in kids’ lives.” \nANOTHER SCHOOL TRADITION IN DECLINE \nTHE death of the party cake in primary schools is being accompanied by a drop-off in long-distance excursions. \nIt was once the rite of passage for those about to enter high school, but the few-day trips to places like Canberra are on the decline, parents say. \nThese excursions to the nation’s capital weren’t simply about learning Australia’s political and cultural history. It was the toboggan ride in the ski fields and odd pillow fight with schoolmates which gave lasting fun memories. \nCentral Coast P&C spokeswoman Sharryn Brownlee says school excursions in general have been steadily dropping off over the past 10 years. \n“This is another loss which has been detrimental to kids’ learning,” Ms Brownlee said. \n“Those of us who have long gone through school remember the trips to Canberra, where you learn a lot about Australia’s political history and have plenty of fun along with way with singalongs, instead of just sitting in front of iPads. \n“These trips give children some of their best childhood memories.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:43:48.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
