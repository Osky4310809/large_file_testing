Playing in Turin is not easy for our opponents, they suffer in the environment of Juventus Stadium.\" — JuventusFC (@juventusfcen) February 17, 2017 \nDybala opted not to celebrate his strikes against his former club, who are in serious danger of relegation. \nHe also talked up his relationship with Higuain after they each laid on an assist for one another. \nJuve surge further clear at summit \n\"I knew that if I scored I wouldn't celebrate,\" Dybala said. \n\"Out of respect for my former fans and team-mates I didn't celebrate. I did hug Higuain but that was a thank you for the assist he gave me. \n\"We are talking a lot to improve the understanding between us and we hope to continue like this.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:31:32.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
