The thieves stole her money and jewelry.\n“You can’t believe to have every other day have a robbery,” she said.\nDuring the fourth time, she confronted the burglar even though she knew it was dangerous to do so. “He just kept walking out the door, and he left. He didn’t say goodbye. He just wanted to get out,” Romer recalled.\nWhen asked if she was scared, Romer said she didn’t know but “just was so bewildered by how he got in.”\nRomer said she missed the days in the 1930s when she and her friends were able to roam the streets without worrying about their safety. “Our parents didn’t worry about us. We were good children,” she reminisced.\nSince the break-ins, Romer has had numerous security cameras installed inside and outside her house, changed her locks and added lights. Her neighbor are now keeping a close eye on her.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T03:32:29.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
