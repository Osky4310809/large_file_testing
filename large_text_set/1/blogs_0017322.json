The sense of self entitlement some of these newcomer actors have is beyond imagination. If only they were half as talented. \nTo which Harshvardhan responded with a series of tweets, saying: Just take my name https://t.co/D2Y3ivBbQW — Harshvardhan Kapoor (@HarshKapoor_) January 19, 2017 And go through people's filmographys while your at it https://t.co/D2Y3ivBbQW — Harshvardhan Kapoor (@HarshKapoor_) January 19, 2017 It's amazing , you can't share your thoughts at all , then you become the anatagonist you guys run a business on things actors say https://t.co/D2Y3ivBbQW — Harshvardhan Kapoor (@HarshKapoor_) January 19, 2017 It's not entitlement it's an opinion just like how your magazine always has one https://t.co/D2Y3ivBbQW — Harshvardhan Kapoor (@HarshKapoor_) January 19, 2017 Don't feel entitled to any award,I'm questioning the principle of who is a newcomer,have zero problems losing to a genuine newcomer — Harshvardhan Kapoor (@HarshKapoor_) January 19, 2017 \nHere's our take on the whole situation. We agree, that everyone has a right to their opinion. But not every opinion needs to be broadcast multiple times across various platforms, till you sound like a petulant child. We get that Harshvardhan is disappointed about not winning the award, but there's no need to drag someone else down because of your warped view of a technicality. Yes, Diljit has acted in Punjabi films, and made an appearance in a Hindi one, but he still comes from a completely different industry. This was his first ever full-fledged role in a Hindi film, and we, and Filmfare , think this counts as a debut. Plus, you've won the other awards in the same category. Missing out on one shouldn't be such a big deal. And, in what we can see as a long career ahead of Harshvardhan, we're sure he'll have countless more opportunities to win prizes. We hope Harshvardhan learns to look forward to the future, instead of making a big deal out of the past.
