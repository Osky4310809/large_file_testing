The vote was the final hurdle the Democratic congressman must clear to become the state’s top law enforcement officer.\nBecerra has vowed to stand up to the Trump administration and fight any federal law he believes infringes on the rights of Californians.\nDemocrats are broadly supportive of Becerra’s nomination and praised his career.\nRepublican Sen. John Moorlach of Costa Mesa says he’s worried Becerra would jeopardize federal funds as attorney general by attacking the Trump administration, while Republican Sen. Joel Anderson of Alpine says he’s not persuaded Becerra would be tough enough on crime.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:56:22.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
