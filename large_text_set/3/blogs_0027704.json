The same year, VAIO entered the smartphone business with the launch of the Android-powered VAIO Phone. Last year, the brand introduced the VAIO Phone BIZ, its first Windows 10 Mobile smartphone. Now, the company has unveiled Android-powered variant of the VAIO Phone BIZ, which is called the VAIO Phone A. \nThe VAIO Phone A offers features an aluminium body with a phablet-grade 5.5-inch full HD display. It is powered by a 1.7GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor, mated to an Adreno 405 GPU and 3GB of RAM. The device comes with 16GB expandable memory, a 13-megapixel primary camera, a 5-megapixel secondary snapper, 4G LTE support, and a 2,800mAh battery. \nSimilar to VAIO’s earlier phones, the Phone A is unlikely to launch outside its home market of Japan. There’s no word on the phone’s pricing at the moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T07:19:57.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
