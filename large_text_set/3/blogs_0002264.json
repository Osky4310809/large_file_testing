However, the smaller car will also debut a host of its own technologies, which are focused on steering the driver out of trouble. \nThe company’s City Safety system, which includes automated emergency braking, has been augmented with steering support, which kicks in should the car detect that braking alone will not prevent a collision. In such cases, the system will provide steering assistance to avoid obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians and large animals, at speeds between 50 and 100 km/h. \nAlso set to be introduced is Oncoming Lane Mitigation, which steers the vehicle back into its lane if the driver wanders out into oncoming traffic; the system is active between 60 km/h and 140 km/h. The optional Blind Spot Information System has also been upgraded and will now be able to steer the car back into its own lane if a lane change is conducted with a vehicle in the driver’s blind spot. \nSet to be based on the same Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) as the 90 Series, the next XC60 is set to grow larger, with a longer wheelbase. Expect the latest Drive-E 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbo petrol and diesel engines, along with 1.5 litre three-cylinder versions and a T5 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid .
