What better way to promote it than taking one of the characters and giving them a real-world officer position? Does that make sense? Does it sound crazy? It happened, so there’s that.\nIt turns out that the Japanese government took the main character from the main Sword Art Online series and protagonist of Sword Art Online the Movie: Ordinal Scale and assigned him a cyber security officer position. This comes from the Japanese government’s National Center for Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) as a part of a tie-in meant to promote the Sword Art Online film.\nThere’s an official poster that goes along with the promotion with the tagline “We will protect the internet,” which is a bit of a hint as to what the movie will be about, though it makes sense in the real world, of course, too. Just don’t expect to be able to call or write Kirito as the cybersecurity officer since he’s, well…a fictional character and all, but you all knew that.\nKirito and additional characters from Sword Art Online will be part of the overall promotion for Sword Art Online the Movie: Ordinal Scale and there will be various posters going up for Cybersecurity Awareness Month in Japan, beginning February 1 through March 18.\nThe film will start showing on February 18 in Japanese theaters, but American fans can get in on the fun too, with United States theaters showing the film beginning March 9, 2017, via Eleven Arts as a limited release. It will first premiere in Japanese with English subtitles in Hollywood, California on March 1. If you’re a big fan of the show, this should be a pretty exciting time for you given Kirito’s new position and all. Major hats off to him and the rest of the team.
