While the total number of people with jobs grew by 13,500, the number of people either employed or looking for work also went up by 0.1 percentage points. \n“Today’s jobs data demonstrates that despite global headwinds our economy remains resilient, recording the third consecutive month of strong growth in jobs, particularly in full-time jobs,” the education and training minister, Simon Birmingham, said after the figures were released. \nBut he recognised the ongoing economic transition posed challenges and said there were about 740,000 Australians who remained unemployed. The young are paying for the privilege of unpaid work - and it's further entrenching inequality Read more \nLabor seized on the increase in the jobless rate to complain the federal government was failing to deliver its jobs plan. “You’re looking at 1.8 million Australians looking for more work or some work and not being able to find it,” the opposition employment spokesman, Brendan O’Connor, told reporters in Melbourne. \n“We are seeing dysfunction, division and failure by the Turnbull government to focus on the biggest challenge it has, the biggest obligation it has, and that is to provide opportunities for Australians to find work.” \nCapital Economics chief economist Paul Dales said the labour market remained “fragile”. \n“The level of employment is only 0.8% higher than a year ago and within that, the number of full-time jobs is 0.4% lower than a year earlier, while the number of part-time jobs is 3.4% higher,” he said. \nDales said underemployment and a high proportion of of part-time work would further restrain wage and income growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T06:30:51.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
