( NFLX ), General Motors Company ( GM ) has started a subscription service called Book Cadillac that lets members order up to 18 times from Cadillac's 10 models for $1,500 a month. The service is currently available only in New York City but will soon be available in Los Angeles and other markets. The company told The Wall Street Journal that the service has 5,000 members currently. It did not disclose the numbers for paying subscribers versus free trial members.

( HTZ ) and Avis Budget Group, Inc. ( CAR ) operate on a somewhat similar model that allows customers to pick up and drop off cars at specific points. There are also small rental agencies that offer customers the choice of renting cars for long-term commitments. However, General Motors is counting on the fact that it charges a flat rate (as opposed to the hourly rate charged by companies like ZipCar) to make a difference. The WSJ report also quotes an expert as saying that GM is trying to get onto the radar of more luxury-oriented customers with this move. GM's new service is sure to resonate with millennial customers used to ride-sharing sites and apps.

Under CEO Mary Barra, the Detroit-based company has made a series of increasingly bold bets for a future in which transportation options are offered as services to consumers. It has invested in ride-sharing app Lyft and launched an intelligent mobility platform last year that uses International Business Machines Corporation's ( IBM ) Watson program. (See also: What a GM and Lyft Partnership Means .) \nGM has also made substantial progress toward developing self-driving cars to compete with the likes of Tesla, Inc. ( TSLA ) and Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ) subsidiary Waymo. Additionally, GM launched a car-sharing service called Maven in January last year. The service has garnered 27,000 members and is present in 17 cities in the United States. As of February, Maven had racked up 57 million miles.

But recent trends have been positive for car companies. A study out in December showed that millennials, who stayed away from car purchases through the recession , are now buying cars at a rate that has surpassed the rate for baby boomers.
