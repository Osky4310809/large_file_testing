The full results of the poll were not shared by either outlet.\nSEE ALSO: Security experts mock website of Trump's cyber czar\nAmong Democrats, a whopping 89 percent did not approve of Trump's use of Twitter. But even among Republicans, only 46 percent said Trump on Twitter is a good idea, while 47 percent would prefer him not tweeting.\nThe poll, which was conducted among 1,000 adults between Jan. 12-15, is not surprising; several earlier polls showed that the majority of Americans want Trump to call it quits on Twitter.\nBut this one comes after the president-elect said he would keep using his personal account, @realDonaldTrump , instead of the official @POTUS account, during his presidency.\n\"I think, I’ll keep it . . . so I’ve got 46 million people right now — that’s a lot, that’s really a lot — but 46 million — including Facebook, Twitter and ya know, Instagram, so when you think that you’re 46 million there, I’d rather just let that build up and just keep it @realDonaldTrump, it’s working,\" Trump recently told The Sunday Times in an interview (note that he has combined all his social media followers into one number; his Twitter account has 20.3 million followers).\nTrump also cited \"dishonest press\" among his reasons to stay active on Twitter.\n\"I don't like tweeting. I have other things I could be doing. But I get very dishonest media, very dishonest press. And it's my only way that I can counteract,\" he said during an interview on Fox News' Fox & Friends.\nBONUS: Obama offers kind words to the media at the end of eight long years", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/G6tTe4Bw.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/G6tTe4Bw.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://twitter.com/POTUS", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/majority-of-americans-disapprove-of-trumps-twitter-use-poll-finds-1484715660", "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/nbc-wsj-poll-nearly-70-percent-americans-give-thumbs-down-n708116"], "published": "2017-01-19T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T11:08:32.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
