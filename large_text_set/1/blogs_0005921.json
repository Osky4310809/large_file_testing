One of the final pictures taken of Bowie (Photo: Jimmy King) He was working on Lazarus when he discovered it was terminal \n\"To me it had to do with the biblical aspect of it, you know the man who would rise again, and it had nothing to do with him being ill. \n\"That was only because I liked the imagery of it,\" he added. \nThe Last Five Years looks at the singer's acclaimed A Reality Tour in 2003 as well as the last four years of his life in which he returned with two albums after a 10-year absence and helped produce hit musical Lazarus. It includes rare and never-before-seen footage of Bowie and interviews during his Ziggy Stardust characterisation and is a follow-up to the acclaimed David Bowie: Five Years, which was broadcast in 2013.

It's more than being a star. \n\"What it is really is that I want to be productive. I'm not content to just be a rock 'n' roll star all my life. I am trying to be one at the moment because I need it at the moment for a particular reason so I can get off and do other things.\" \nThere are also interviews with his long-time producer Tony Visconti who said Bowie was \"at the top of his game\" when recording Blackstar. Tony Visconti has been interviewed for the documentary (Photo: Getty) \nVisconti, the man behind more than half of Bowie's studio albums including The Man Who Sold The World and Heroes, added: \"David had great, grand ideas. \n\"To become well known, famous, for him was initially to have the resources to realise what his ideas were. He really does come from that spirit, he just didn't want to be famous per se.\" \n* David Bowie: The Last Five Years airs on Saturday January 7 at 9pm on BBC Two.
