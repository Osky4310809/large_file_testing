Start spreading the boos \nHow can Sunderland justify a jolly to New York after this dreadful performance? \nMoyes is taking Sunderland on a mid-season break to New York next week, and morale will need raising. \nHope lifted with their win at Crystal Palace. But they had boos ringing in their ears after this collapse. David Moyes is under pressure (Photo: Reuters) Pressure lifted on Claude Puel \nThe Saints had lost six of their previous seven league games and Puel was under a bit of pressure. \nWith the EFL Cup final approaching it was time for an upturn, and after a shaky start they delivered. Staying up? Not at this rate \nFor 20 minutes this was actually one of Sunderland's better footballing performances. They looked solid at the start with five at the back, if vulnerable down the right flank. \nFor the last hour they were dreadful. \nThe atmosphere fell flat after the first goal and they collapsed. There was a worrying lack of spirit. \nMoyes went four at the back second half, adding Steven Pienaar's energy to midfield but it was pitiful to watch. Sunderland are staring at the drop (Photo: Alex Livesey) Gabbiadini two goals in two \nNot for the first time Gabbiadini scored at Sunderland. \nBut it wasn't local hero Marco, legend of a couple of decades ago. \nIt was visiting striker Manolo Gabbiadini, who has now scored twice in his two games since signing for Â£15m in January. \nProblem was, this one went in off Gabbiadini's elbow, and should have been disallowed. \nDavid Moyes saw this coming \nHe warned against his side winning last week then messing up their chance to climb out of the bottom three. \nThis was the essence of Sunderland. Hopes raised by a battling win against Spurs, win at Palace, then back to awful again. \nThey need to string together two wins in a row. But they've only done that once, in November.
