Ian O'Connor of ESPN passed along comments from the outspoken patriarch of the Ball family about the collegiate plans for the other two highly touted members of his clan. He stated Steve Alford 's status doesn't matter amid speculation the former Indiana standout could return to coach the Hoosiers. \"We're going to stick with UCLA even if you put Bobo the Clown in as coach,\" he said. Ball has stolen the spotlight in recent months with a series of outlandish comments ranging from saying Lonzo is already better than Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry, a two-time NBA MVP, to claiming he would've \" killed \" Michael Jordan, the GOAT, one-on-one in his prime. Whether he actually believes those delusions is unclear, but his apparent plan of generating hype for his kids and his Big Baller Brand has been successful. Rarely does a day go by where something he says doesn't become headline news. His constant efforts to drum up attention struck a struck a chord with the Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James, though. After Ball stated his kids were better set up for future success than James', the four-time MVP and three-time NBA champion fired back, per Dave McMenamin of ESPN.com. \"Keep my kids' name out of your mouth. Keep my family out of your mouth,\" James said. \"This is dad to dad. It's a problem now.\" The elder Ball's antics aside, his most recent comments about LiAngelo and LaMelo heading to UCLA is terrific news for the future of the Bruins' program. LiAngelo Ball is a 3-star small forward in the class of 2017, according to Scout.com . He's a dangerous, streaky shooter who's probably going to have some massive scoring outputs at the collegiate level. The wait for LaMelo Ball, a member of the 2019 class, will take a little longer. That said, all signs point to him becoming a dynamic combo guard. He's a 5-star prospect who rates at the No. 16 overall prospect in 2019, per Scout.com . Both of them committed to UCLA back in 2015. Meanwhile, Lonzo Ball is trying to wrap up what's expected to become a one-and-done college career by leading the Bruins to a national title. The guard has tallied 33 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds in the first two games of the NCAA tournament to lead UCLA to the Sweet 16. He's one of the top prospects in the 2017 NBA draft class. He'll compete with the likes of Washington's Markelle Fultz and Kansas' Josh Jackson to become the first overall pick.
