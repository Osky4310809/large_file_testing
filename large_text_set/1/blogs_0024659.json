By Mike White / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nThe old Washington High School gymnasium oozes history. A banner on a wall denotes a WPIAL-record 52-game winning streak in the 1980s. The place has a certain charm, arena seating in a horseshoe, and all of the seats are old and wooden. Heck, before the starting lineups are introduced the PA announcer exclaims to the crowd, \"Welcome to the most historic place in Western Pennsylvania.\" \nWashington's team added to the history Friday night. \nIn a big WPIAL Class 3A Section 4 game that featured two of the top seven scorers in the WPIAL, Washington defeated visiting Southmoreland, 65-55. \nThe win clinched a playoff spot for Washington -- and that's a historical feat. Washington will be in the postseason for the 61st time, the most in WPIAL history. Uniontown also has qualified 60 times, but might not make it this year. \nThe win also pretty much sewed up a section title for Washington (14-3 overall, 9-0 in section). With three section games left, Washington, the Post-Gazette's No. 3 Class 3A team, has a two-game lead over No. 4 Southmoreland (14-2, 7-2). It would be Washington's 44th section title, second only to Uniontown's 47. \nThe player who fueled Washington's latest push to history also has a tie to Washington's glory days. Senior guard Matt Popeck, the seventh-leading scorer in the WPIAL, scored 29 points, including 20 in the first half as the Little Prexies took a 12-point lead. Popeck's father, Chris, and uncle, Matt, were key players on those great teams in the 1980s. \n\"These kids have never won a section, so this important,\" said venerable Washington coach Ron Faust, who also was the coach in the 1980s. \"There is nothing in this world that I would like more than for these kids to be able to experience some of the great things that happened in this gym. A little bit of that atmosphere was back tonight.\" \nWashington beat Southmoreland, 82-63, earlier this season when Southmoreland's 6-foot-10 junior Brandon Stone had 24 points. Stone, who has Division I college offers and came in averaging 27 points, was held to 18 Friday night. Washington played mostly man-to-man defense, and Stone was able to get only 14 shots. He had 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. \n\"We had way more back-side help on him on defense this time and we tried to double him every time,\" Matt Popeck said. \"We had to make other dudes beat us.\" \nA slew of turnovers in the first half hurt Southmoreland, and Popeck was speeding up and down the court, making plays. Stone had six points in the first half. Southmoreland cut Washington's lead to six at one point in the second quarter, but the deficit was a dozen at halftime. \n\"Washington did what everyone else does to Brandon -- sack on the backside and force someone else to beat you,\" Southmoreland coach Frank Muccino said. \"We didn't have anyone else that was attacking in the first half. We were almost too fixated on the post on offense.\" \nSouthmoreland cut Washington's lead to five late in the third quarter, but could get no closer. Two other Washington players scored in double figures. Jacob Swartz, a 6-4 senior center, had 12 and senior forward Isaiah Robinson had 10. Senior forward Tommy Pisula had 11 for Southmoreland. \nThe win added a bit more confidence to a Washington team that is thinking big. \n\"I'd love to say we could win it all [the WPIAL], if we work hard enough,\" Popeck said. \nMike White: mwhite@post-gazette.com and Twitter @mwhiteburgh.
