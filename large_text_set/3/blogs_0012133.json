For starters, we’re talking about applications that have effectively been abandoned and not updated for modern standards. If they don’t support 64 bit, they probably also have the old iOS look. These apps are not optimized for performance either. Finally, Apple has to maintain 32bit and 64bit versions of libraries in order to support both types of apps. If you’re running both older and newer apps, then both sets of libraries have to be loaded into memory. This should really streamline efficiency and also serve to force updates to old apps. If they’ve been abandoned they should be pulled from the store just on principle anyway. Andrew Mondt \nThis is extremely annoying as some of these abandoned games I still enjoy. Yarrenbool \nThis makes sense from Apple’s point of view, I understand this. But what happens to people still using an iPhone 4S which, I think, is 32 bit? \nMy main phone is a 6-Plus but I keep my old 4S as a backup, or spare, just in case. I also use my old 4S when traveling and pop a local SIM into it. \nI also know at least three people who have never upgraded their 4S and use them daily. \nI’m guessing that, like iOS on the 4S, apps will simply never get any updates nor will any future apps be built to run on the 4S, right? CAIO MARIOZ \nThey could upgrade to iPhone 5S Yarrenbool \nYeah, but I’m sure you know these types, they won’t consider upgrading until their 4Ss totally give up their ghosts! :-) \nWith my own 4S it certainly isn’t worth upgrading. I’ll just wait till I upgrade to the “8”, or whatever it will be called, and then my current 6+ will take over from my 4S and become my spare and travelling phone. buzz \nYou can stay on iOS10.3 and no problem with 32bit games on your 6+ 5723alex . \nNo problem as iPhone 4s won’t get iOS 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T07:44:28.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
