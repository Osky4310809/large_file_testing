The flowers are blooming, snow is melting and new smartphones are being announced. The first major release comes March 29 from Samsung, which is expected to announce the Galaxy S8. Follow our live coverage of Samsung's event to get down to the nitty-gritty.\nBut whether you get a Galaxy S8 or one of those swanky red iPhones , you need to consider your carrier plan. Which plan is the most affordable? How much are extra lines? Should I get a prepaid plan or a postpaid plan? We are here to help with answers to those questions and more.\nWhich carrier has the cheapest plans? All of the carriers offer unlimited talk and texting, so your decision will likely come down to the cost of data. Unfortunately, there are no apples-to-apples here. AT&T, Sprint , T-Mobile and Verizon 's data plans are all slightly different.\nThis handy chart I made below should help. It compares the total cost over two years on each carrier except T-Mobile -- more on the \"uncarrier\" later. To make things as easy as possible, I added up the costs of carrier activation fees, monthly line access charges, financing a new $649 phone (the price of a 32GB Google Pixel or iPhone 7 ) and a monthly data plan over 24 months -- this does not compare taxes, surcharges or other regulatory fees (and my sanity hopes you'll understand).\nTotal cost for a single line and a new phone over 2 years Carrier One-time activation fee Monthly cost of $649 phone Monthly access charge Monthly data plan Total cost over two years AT&T Next Every Year Plan $25 $27/month $20/month 3GB for $40/month $2,115 ($88/month) Verizon Plan $30 $27/month $20/month 5GB for $35/month* $1,998* ($83/month) Sprint Installment Plan $25 $27/month $25/month 3GB for $25/month* $1,880* ($78/month) Sprint 18 Month Lease $25 $27/month $25/month 3GB/month for $25/month* $1,418* (18 months at $79/month) * includes $5/month autopay discount\nWhat about T-Mobile and unlimited data plans? As of today, all four major carriers offer unlimited data plans.\nJosh Miller/CNET I didn't include T-Mobile in the previous section because the carrier only has an unlimited data plan. But as of today all of the major carriers have unlimited data plans . A single line of unlimited data on Sprint is $50/month , T-Mobile is $70/month and Verizon is $80/month . AT&T offers two unlimited plans: Choice at $60/month and Plus at $90/month .\nThe Choice plan limits people to standard definition video, data speeds capped at 3 megabits per second and has no hotspot data allowance. The Plus plan does away with the Choice plan's limitations (just turn off their Stream Saver to get HD video), and includes 10GB of hotspot data before its speed gets slowed down.\nHere's a chart comparing the total cost between carriers of a new phone and a single line on an unlimited data plan.\nSingle line unlimited data plans and cost of new phone over 2 years Carrier Data throttled after One-time activation fee Monthly cost of $649 phone Unlimited data monthly cost Total cost for single line over 2 years AT&T Plus 22GB/month $25 $27/month $90/month* $2,834 ($118/month) Verizon 22GB/month $30 $27/month $80/month* $2,599 ($108/month) T-Mobile One 30GB/month $20 SIM starter kit $26 upfront, $26/month $70/month* $2,350 ($98/month) AT&T Choice 22GB/month $25 $27/month $60/month* $2,114 ($88/month) Sprint 23GB/month $30 $27/month $50/month* through March 2018, then $60/month* $1,999 ($83/month) * includes $5/month autopay discount\nA warning: There's definitely some fine print here.\nAT&T, Sprint and Verizon plans do not include taxes, surcharges or additional fees which depending on where you live can be a significant cost At the time of this writing, Sprint's $50/month promotion expires March 31, 2018 at which point a single line will increase to $60/month. All plans include a $5 per month discount for setting up automatic payments. Verizon and AT&T limit data speed and priority access after 22GB, Sprint after 23GB and T-Mobile after 30GB. Verizon, T-Mobile One, Sprint and AT&T include high-definition video streaming with their plans. AT&T Choice limits you to standard definition (think DVD quality).\nAll of the carriers include a mobile hotspot allowance with their unlimited plans. Sprint, T-Mobile One, AT&T Plus and Verizon allow up to 10GB of hotspot data a month. AT&T Choice does not include hotspot data.\nAdditional line costs for unlimited plans are all over the place. Both AT&T Plus and Choice offer a second line for $55/month and additional lines up to 10 for $20/month (unless it's for a wearable then the cost is $10/month). Sprint gives you a third, fourth and fifth extra line for free until March 31, 2018, after which Sprint's unlimited plan reverts back to regular pricing: $60/month for first line, $40/month for second line and $30/month for lines three through five.\nBelow is a chart comparing the various prices of adding extra lines to your unlimited plan.\nComparison of carrier additional line costs for unlimited plans Carrier First line cost Second line cost Third line cost Fourth line cost Total monthly cost for four lines AT&T Plus $90/month* $55/month $20/month $20/month $185/month Verizon $80/month* $60/month $22/month $18/month $180/month* T-Mobile $70/month* $30/month $41/month $19/month $160/month* AT&T Choice $60/month* $55/month $20/month $20/month $155/month Sprint pre-March 31, 2018 $50/month* $40/month $0/month $0/month $90/month* Sprint post-March 31, 2018 $60/month* $40/month $30/month $30/month $160/month* *includes $5/month autopay discount, a $10 monthly discount for AT&T\nAre prepaid plans a better deal than postpaid? The newest iPhone sold on Sprint's prepaid plan is the 5S model from 2013.\nSarah Tew/CNET It depends on the carrier. Up to this point, all of the carrier plans mentioned in this article have been postpaid -- you pay monthly after you use the service. Prepaid plans are also monthly, but you pay in advance for the data you think you will use. If you need more, you buy more. Prepaid phone plans also don't have a contract.\nWhat really makes prepaid plans cheaper is the lack of a monthly line access fee. Over two years, this fee can cost you as much as $600 on a postpaid plan. Carriers make up for the this fee by charging more for data. AT&T and T-Mobile prepaid plans will save you some money compared to their postpaid ones, while Verizon's prepaid plan is pretty close in cost to its postpaid plans. And even though Sprint's prepaid and postpaid plans are ridiculously cheap, you can save hundreds by going prepaid.\nSo what are the downsides? The process of constant filling and refilling your data plan can be exhausting. Though, there are options for autopay. AT&T will even give you a $5/month discount when you use autopay for a prepaid GoPhone.\nAnother downside is the lack of family/multiple line options and pricing. Handset selection can be a negative, too. Sprint has a limited number of phones that work with its prepaid plans -- the newest prepaid flagship phones available are the iPhone 5S and the Samsung Galaxy S3. On the other hand, AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon offer prepaid access to newer phones like the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 .\nThe chart below compares the cost for prepaid plans on AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. The cost includes activation fee along with monthly data plan charges for 24 months, but it does not include the cost of your phone.\nPrepaid plan comparison (without cost of phone) Carrier One-time activation fee Monthly data plan Total data plan cost for two years T-Mobile $20 SIM starter kit 3GB for $40/month $980 AT&T $25 + $5 SIM card 3GB for $40/month* $990 Sprint $0 3GB for $45/month $1,080 Verizon $0 5GB for $50/month $1,250 * includes $5/month autopay discount\nHow does Google's Project Fi fit into all this? Google's Project Fi service works only on the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X.\nJosh Miller/CNET Project Fi is Google's high speed phone service which uses a combination of Wi-Fi networks and data from carriers like Sprint and T-Mobile to always keep you connected. The unlimited talk and text plan costs $20/month ($15/month on a family plan), which is similar in cost to the line access fees that AT&T, Sprint and Verizon charge on postpaid plans. The data rate is $10 per 1GB.\nThese prices apply internationally, too. Google Fi is supported in over 135 countries, so if you're traveling abroad you pay exactly as much as you'd pay at home.\nProject Fi has no contracts and works a bit like a prepaid plan where you pay everything up front. If you have leftover data, your account is credited with whatever you didn't use. So you only pay for what you actually use. That's nice.\nThe downsides with Project Fi are that it only works on the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X phones and connectivity might be spotty in areas where Sprint and T-Mobile's coverage is thin.\nIs it true that I can save money by setting up automatic payments of my bill? All carriers offer discounts for letting them automatically deduct from your bank account, as well as chatbots named Jessica.\nScreenshot by Patrick Holland/CNET Yes, it is true! All four major US carriers offer a $5 monthly discount for letting them automatically deduct money from your bank to pay your bill. Over the course of two years, this discount can save you $120.\nHowever, there is some fine print here. Verizon only offers the discount for its unlimited plan as well as certain single line data plans. AT&T limits its autopay discount to its unlimited plans and prepaid GoPhone plans. AT&T does increase that discount to $10 a month for an unlimited data plan with multiple lines.\nI'm still not sure what plan is best for me, what should I do? This has been a comparison of pricing for the major carriers, but smaller carriers' pricing can sometimes be equally competitive. The costs of a carrier phone plan is only part of the bigger picture. For many, a network's coverage and data speeds are just as important, if not more so. It's also worth asking around to see what your friends and family's experiences are with a particular carrier, too. This is especially important if you're entering into a family or sharing plan with them. But ultimately, it's your decision. If you think you're paying too much, you probably are and should start shopping around. If you're happy with what you got, consider sticking with that carrier and plan.\nIf you still haven't considered where to buy your phone or if you should get an unlocked one , we can help with that, too.\nLinks to each carriers unlimited plans: Sprint , AT&T , T-Mobile and Verizon.\nBest iPhone 7 cases : Protect your precious phone with a spangly new case.\n9 things Alexa can't yet do : Our wishlist of features Amazon needs to add to its smart assistant.\nUpdated: March 9, 2017, to reflect a change of T-Mobile's data cap from 28GB to 30GB per month and March 28, 2017, to link to Samsung's live event.", "external_links": ["https://www.verizonwireless.com/plans/verizon-plan/", "https://fi.google.com/about/phones/", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/q8Mavb7SN2SyGd8sEQVgX7_AjvI=/fit-in/970x0/2017/02/15/26c802df-43d7-4adb-b48f-a51bb4886a8f/carrier-photos-8039-005.jpg", "https://www.sprint.com/landings/unlimited-cell-phone-plans/index.html", "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/fLBg5_gCiCqaMRw5WzwuRoscmIg=/fit-in/970x0/2016/10/14/84054ae1-4f2a-4c02-ba17-7a135c08f797/google-pixel-9100-004.jpg", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/Ct4YkCe34eqb6agluZeTV937b_E=/770x433/2016/08/02/cb316089-53cb-4572-8dda-9adc71e82764/screen-shot-2016-08-02-at-1-09-02-pm.png", "https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans", "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/34RK2R7yanuthM0vATZq3DYKL6I=/fit-in/970x0/2017/02/17/e16fb938-976f-4fa8-b370-3ff35ced95b6/verizon-sprint-chatbot-named-jessica.jpg", "https://prepaid.sprint.com/#!/shop/phones/@New,Apple%C2%AE,Samsung/", "https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/unlimited-plan.html", "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/8rpHSab_UeUSANSmD-ol7zQIrKw=/fit-in/970x0/2013/09/18/fc382384-6de5-11e3-913e-14feb5ca9861/iPhone5s_35781409_07.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-28T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T22:50:12.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
