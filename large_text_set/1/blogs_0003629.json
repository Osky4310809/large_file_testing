Someone spray-painted vulgar anti-religious messages on the walls — and apparently did the same thing to a few other churches in the area. \nSome of the messages on there —“Religion is slavery,”“God is a cunt,” etc. — suggest an atheist was the culprit. That hasn’t been confirmed by police. Needless to say, it’s a despicable act, whoever did it. Religious people have every right to worship in peace. There’s a way to voice your disagreements with their beliefs, and this isn’t it. \n(Thanks to @NorseMythNews for the link)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T18:03:55.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
