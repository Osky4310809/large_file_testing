Morning Madness: Tuesday, Feb. 21 NCAA.com Contact | Archive | RSS \nHere's what you need to know in college hoops for Tuesday, Feb. 21. \nThe marquee matchups of the week aren't going down until Wednesday night with Butler vs. Villanova, Duke vs. Syracuse and UNC vs. Louisville. Still, the ACC had some interesting developments on Monday … \nIn case you missed it \n• Miami picked up a huge win on the road against No. 18 Virginia on Monday night. It took an extra period to do it, but the Hurricanes edged the Cavaliers 54-48 in OT . Before the game, the Cavaliers retired former Virginia star Malcolm Brogdon's jersey . After the game, Canes coach Jim Larrañaga showed off his dance moves: Locker room is lit. pic.twitter.com/8uN6NDQP1q \n• No. 12 West Virginia handled Texas 77-62 at home , and No. 19 Florida State ... well, FSU was not very nice to Boston College, taking down the Eagles 104-72 . \n• The Week 16 AP Top 25 was released Monday afternoon, and though the top three teams didn't change, there was plenty of movement. Here's our reaction , and our look behind the numbers . \n• The NBA dunk contest was on Saturday, but this throwdown by Texas freshman Jarrett Allen may have been the best of the holiday weekend. \n• Check out who made the latest edition of NCAA.com's All-Week Team . \n• Full Monday scoreboard \nWhat to watch for today \n• It's the second day in a row without a ranked vs. ranked matchup (who's counting?). The highlight of the night probably will be No. 13 Florida (22-5, 12-2 SEC) taking on South Carolina (20-7, 10-4 SEC). The Gamecocks just fell out of the Top 25 after five weeks in the rankings, but they have a chance to prove themselves against a Florida team that is riding an eight-game winning streak ( 7 ET, ESPN ). \n• Four other ranked teams are playing tonight: No. 9 Baylor (22-5) takes on Oklahoma (9-17) ( 7 ET, ESPNU ), No. 11 Kentucky (22-5) travels to Missouri (7-19), No. 14 Purdue (22-5) heads to Penn State (14-13), and No. 25 Wichita State, which entered the AP's rankings this week for the first time this season, hosts Evansville (14-15). \n• Full Tuesday schedule \nStat of the day \n2,543 -- Days it had been since Virginia lost four games in a row. The last time was on March. 6, 2010, when the Cavaliers lost nine straight to close out the regular season in Tony Bennett's first year as head coach. The Cavaliers have dropped games to Virginia Tech, Duke, North Carolina and now Miami. \nWho's taking over the race for the Naismith? \nWith just over a week left until the finalists are announced, some separation is starting to show -- finally! -- in the race for the Naismith Award. The point guard of the Kansas Jayhawks, Frank Mason III, leads this week's Naismith Watch . \nBracket tip of the day: Which is the best (and worst) regional to end up in? \nOther than 2011, when the Southeast and Southwest regionals made a one-time appearance, we’ve had the same four regionals for the past 10 years: East, West, South and Midwest. Looking at the tournament history for those past 10 years gives us some interesting insights. \nBRACKET CHALLENGE GAME SIGN UP NOW For starters, if you’re a top-ranked team, cross your fingers that you don’t end up in the Midwest. Over the past 10 years, one third of all games in the Midwest regional have been upsets (any lower-ranked team defeating a higher-ranked team) — the most of any regional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:34:17.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
