In response, Nicki’s ex referred to the potency of the diss track. \n“It’s just a very disrespectful record,” Safaree said. “It’s probably the most disrespectful record I’ve ever heard in my life. That shit is very out of pocket.” \nWhen asked if Nicki should respond to Remy, Safaree didn’t seem terribly confident in the Jamaica, Queens MC’s ability to issue a worthy response. \n“I don’t know. ‘Cause it’s like what can you even say … What can you even say to Remy? It’s really not much,” he said. \nIn regards to providing backup for his former boo, Safaree says he’s good. \n“I don’t get caught up in the whole female beef thing. I’mma just try to mind my business as much as possible,” Safaree said when asked if he’ll provide Nicki with any assistance. A post shared by Safaree 🇯🇲 (@iamsafaree) on Feb 25, 2017 at 1:47pm PST \nBased on the lyrical content of “SHETHER,” many were quick to assume that either Safaree or Meek Mill provided Remy with intel for the song. \nIn fact, while speaking about his shady namedrop on “SHETHER” yesterday (February 27) on Hot 97, Ebro Darden speculated that Safaree was “possibly” the culprit due to what he claimed was prior jealousy.
