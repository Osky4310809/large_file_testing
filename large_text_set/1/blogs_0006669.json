She manages it through diet and routine cortisone shots, Us added. Psoriasis is a chronic disease of your immune system that causes cells to build up on the surface of your skin, leading to thick, red, scaly patches that are very itchy and sometimes painful. Up to 7.5 million Americans suffer from the disease, which has a surprisingly significant economic impact, to the tune of approximately $112 billion a year if you count both direct costs of treatment and indirect costs such as related health problems. People with psoriasis are at an increased risk of numerous other chronic diseases, including eye conditions, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. And then there are the psychological repercussions — because it not only can be painful, but disfiguring if the outbreak is uncontrolled. If you have psoriasis, it is imperative that you have your vitamin D levels tested and maintain levels in the therapeutic range of 50-70 ng/ml year-round. Vitamin D is a potent immune modulator , making it very important for the prevention of autoimmune diseases. If you opt for a supplement, be sure to take vitamin D3 — not synthetic D2 — and take vitamin K2 and magnesium in conjunction with it . Vitamin D is fat-soluble, so taking some form of healthy fat with it will also help optimize absorption.
