From stiletto nails to aquarium nails ( yes, those exist ), professional and amateur manicurists alike have proven that if you can think it, you can put it on your nails. Kim Kardashian is usually one to play it safe with her manicures. But yesterday she stepped into the world of cray nail art in a big way. Kardashian is now sporting ~ pierced nails ~ and oooo, this is a lewk . But we’re into it. Kardashian shared her new look via Snapchat and in the video, she can be heard saying, “ Khloé would be so proud of me right now .” Girl, we all are. We think Kim may have gotten inspiration for her pierced nails from freelance nail artist, Mei Kawajiri. Kawajiri is responsible for the nails that appeared on the models during last week’s Balenciaga Men’s Fashion Week show. To the event, Kawajiri wore her own pierced nail creation, which looks very similar to Kardashian’s new style. Even though the nails look great, we must admit that we are concerned about Kim’s near future. How will she pick things up, use her phone, use the bathroom, etc.? People on Instagram are also feeling just as unsure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T00:42:06.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
