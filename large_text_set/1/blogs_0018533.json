Next week on The Bachelor , Nick and his girl gang ship out from the mansion in sunny Southern California and wash up on the slightly less sunny shores of Nick’s home state of Wisconsin. And what better way to welcome a bunch of sexy singles competing for the affection of one man to America’s dairyland than by visiting a working farm full of flies and asking them to bottle-feed baby bovines and shovel cow crap? Corinne, the 24-year-old Miami princess who still has a nanny, is less than enthused to be part of this date. “This is probably the worst date I’ve ever been on,” she whines. “You can’t escape the poop.” And also she, like, totally needs sushi. (Fun fact: You too can plan a romantic rendezvous at this ranch in Omro, Wis. , which was the first U.S. dairy to use automatic milking machines. And they say TV isn’t educational.) While the other “ladies” put smiles on their faces and delve into muck-shoveling duty without complaining, Corinne scampers out of the pen to pout on a rock nearby. “She’s used to being babied,” scoffs Jasmine. “She’s like, ‘Oh I don’t want to do this so I’m going to cry about it.’” Related: ‘The Bachelor’ Episode 3 Recap: All Aboard the Vomit Comet If you’re wondering why the action has already moved to Nick’s hometown so early, host Chris Harrison says “extenuating circumstances” caused production to make some last-minute changes. “Our first trip was supposed to be to Kiawah Island in South Carolina, but Mother Nature had different plans,” the host explains. “There was a Category 5 hurricane bearing down on the island, exactly where we were supposed to go, and it wasn’t safe to film. We obviously couldn’t put everyone in the middle of a hurricane — although that would have been good TV, and I’d argue a good way for Nick to see which ladies worked best in a crisis.” Related: Chris Harrison Blogs ‘The Bachelor’ Episode 3 The production team came up with a plan B “within a matter of 12 to 15 hours,” Harrison continues. “There was no preproduction for that week. We had to change everything about what we were going to do including the location and the dates themselves. We were flying by the seat of our pants, booking random hotel rooms, and setting up dates on the fly.” When they realized the last-minute location change was necessary, Harrison suggested letting Nick and the women in on what was happening. “I said, ‘Let’s just be honest and embrace it and make it fun,’” says the host. “By the time I had to have the talk with the girls about the week, we still had no idea where we were going. It was like, ’We are going somewhere today, but we’re not sure where that somewhere is.’” Related: ‘The Bachelor’: Nick Viall Explains That Awkward Shower Scene Harrison is thankful that this climate-caused calamity happened in Season 21, when The Bachelor production is clearly a well-oiled machine. “If this had happened in the Andrew Firestone days, we’d have been in trouble,” he jokes. “The girls would have gotten glamorous dates in Burbank. ‘Ladies, who wants to go to the Valley?’” The Bachelor airs Mondays on ABC at 8 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:47:49.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
