The social media manager, Curtis Burns (a former TSA officer and a songwriter who claims he once had “ZERO experience in aviation security”), employs a dry sense of humor to tackle questions sent in from airline passengers, such as: “Can you bring knitting needles on a plane?” “Do you need to check Bubbe’s menorah?” And, “What about a six-pack of now-defunct Pliny the Elder beer?” The exchanges are funny—a quality rarely associated with the TSA—with a cheeky, matter-of-fact deadpan patter. Consider the image of a confiscated jackknife, found hidden in a medicine bottle, captioned: “Intentionally concealing a knife (no matter how small) can lead to headaches such as fines and arrest.” Of a large spear gun, Burns writes: “Flying fish are found in the ocean, not on commercial aircraft.” The oddest query he’s received so far? “The individual who sent us a picture of their grill asking if they could wear it through security!” he writes. \nEven if the TSA is an organization that is associated more often with grumbles about long waits and oversize toiletries than anything involving humor, Burns has his reasons for running the feed as he does. “It not only makes people want to read your content, it makes them want to come back and read more,” writes Burns. “It has allowed us to put a human face on a large government agency.” In addition, the account is a better option than calling an automated 1-800 number with inquiries. “It’s also allowed us to amass over 600,000 followers,” he writes. “That’s 600,000 people we can reach out to at any time for a regular post, or urgent messaging.” Have some time to kill at the airport this week? Follow the account: A little bit of humor goes a long way—especially while you’re waiting to go through security.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T19:15:05.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
