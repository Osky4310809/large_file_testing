Based on a recent Insta, a Chantel Jeffries x ColourPop collab could be dropping soon. She posted a picture yesterday in an office that clearly has ColourPop's Super Shock Shadows in the background. And her caption sealed the deal: \"Up to something.\" The picture has already received 108,930 likes — and counting — so the excitement is real. In case you aren't one of Jeffries's 2.5 million Instagram followers, the social media queen does a little bit of everything these days. A year ago, she started DJing under the name CeeJay the Dj and is coming out with new music soon. That's not her only musical connection. Jeffries has modeled in a Guess campaign with rapper A$AP Rocky. She's also appeared in a rom com called The Perfect Match .
