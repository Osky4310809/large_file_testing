The juniors consider themselves to be like brothers, so the constant bickering is no surprise. (Glenn Graham) \n\"I trust these guys, ultimately, and we just got out running and I knew whoever was open we were going to get the ball in their hands,\" Higgs said. \"There's no words – you just get that chill down your spine every time the ball goes through the net.\" \nAfter falling at Perry Hall, 53-37, on Dec. 16, the Millers (15-6) won 12 of their next 14 games to finish in first in Baltimore County's Division I. \nThey got eight points apiece from Ugo Obasi, Jeremiah Simmons and Jawan Smith and showed no quit in getting within 10 in the fourth quarter. But the Gators were simply not to be denied. \nIn addition to winning their first county crown, the Gators also tied the program mark for wins in a season – they went 21-4 last season in reaching the Class 4A state semifinals. Higgs said they aren't through. \n\"Part of me wants to say it's big, but it's just another step in the real truth in trying to get that state championship, so this is just another milestone for us,\" Higgs said. \nThe teams will continue their quest for state championships with region play. In the Class 3A North, Milford Mill will host Baltimore County foe Lansdowne on Thursday with Perry Hall getting a first-round bye in the Class 4A North. On Feb. 28, the Gators will host the winner of Parkville and Bel Air's opening-round game. \ntwitter.com/GlennGrahamSun", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:01:25.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
