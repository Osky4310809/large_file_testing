We just go to work every day, push each other, make plays and just be that SEC duo. That’s really what we’re looking for: just being that SEC duo that everyone talks about — that Quincy Wilson and Jalen Tabor type. That’s what we’re working toward this year.” \nWilson and Tabor were stars at Florida, where they both decided to jump into the NFL Draft following their junior seasons. Some prognosticators believe they both could be selected in the first round later this spring. \nThe Davis duo have a ways to go before receiving those accolades. \nCarlton Davis had 46 tackles and 10 pass breakups last season, but did not record an interception. Javaris Davis picked off two passes and broke up seven throws. \n“I just have to keep going,” Javaris Davis said. “Never take a play off. (Play) every play like it’s my last, and that’s what coach always preached to us. So, I just have to stay on top of it and play every play like it’s my last play.” \nCarlton Davis was an All-SEC selection as a freshman. The rising junior knows bigger things could be on the horizon for himself and his teammate in the fall. \n“We’re veterans now,” Carlton Davis said. “It’s time to really get after it. We’re really trying to help our receivers grow more, because we’ve got a lot of young receivers, but we’re experienced guys. We’ve been there, done that. This is our second spring, so by now we’ve seen a lot. We’re just trying to help our teammates grow.” \nJavaris Davis’ strength is in man-to-man press coverages, Carlton Davis said. “His speed is outrageous and he has good ball skills, so he’s going to make plays on the ball,” he explained.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:48:36.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
