Practical advice and easy-to-learn exercises to strengthen your powers of ESP \nEVERY ONCE IN a while, you get the feeling that the phone is going to ring... and it does. Or you know who it is that is calling... and you are right. A song is playing in your head; you turn on the radio, and there it is... the same song. You are overwhelmed, somehow, with the feeling that a close friend or relative is in trouble or needs your help at that moment... and you soon learn that is actually the case. \nAre these examples of mere coincidence? Or is there something more profound taking place? Are we, in fact, tapping in to what many researchers believe is a shared consciousness -- or superconsciousness -- that connects all people... perhaps all living things? \ncontinue reading below our video Great Singers Gone too Soon These are no longer just \"New Age\" concepts, but are subjects of serious speculation and research by a growing number of mainstream scientists in the fields of quantum theory, psychology, and other disciplines. The idea that extrasensory perception (ESP) and related psi abilities are quite real (if difficult to measure) phenomena is gaining respectability. \nThose who research ESP suspect that most if not all people have this remarkable ability to varying degrees. The ability is often likened to that of musical talent. Some people are naturally gifted with the ability to play and compose music, and practice makes them virtuosos. Others must learn and work and practice to be able to play an instrument even adequately or in the simplest way. But nearly everyone can learn to play to some degree. The same may hold true for psychic abilities. \nHere's what you need to know about developing your psychic abilities. \nACKNOWLEDGE THE ABILITY \nThe first step is to acknowledge that ESP exists and that it is present within you to develop. Although this might sound silly or trite, begin by telling yourself that you are psychic. Make it a mantra that you repeat to yourself daily and often. This kind of self-talk has a scientific basis. It is now known that when a person learns something -- whether it's a physical skill like wood carving or a mental exercise like memorizing poetry -- through repetition, his or her brain physically changes -- \"rewires\" itself, if you will -- to accommodate that task. This process of rewiring your brain for psychic ability begins with your belief in it. \n\"It takes time for the subconscious to be able to communicate with the conscious mind, and the best way to do this is to simply start thinking about it,\" says Russel Steward in an article for Psychic Journal . \"All these thoughts have a positive effect on developing your gift. Read about the subject. Knowledge will help, as you need some understanding of how things work. Adopt the policy you would take with a new hobby. Become involved in it, buy books and magazines, and look for more information on the Internet.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T09:48:05.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
