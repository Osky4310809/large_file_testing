Mugabe has been endorsed as the ruling party’s presidential candidate. \nEarlier in the day, the police deployed water cannon and anti-riot officers on the streets of the capital ahead of the protest. \nAn anti-government protests in August descended into some of the worst violence seen in the southern African nation for two decades as anger over economic hardship boiled over.
