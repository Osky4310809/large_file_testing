New lighting systems ensure even greater safety. Passengers are 'always online' thanks to a WLAN hotspot. The new programme includes two 1.0-TSI engines with three cylinders, which are efficient and low-emission, yet dynamic. The upgraded models will be presented to the public for the first time at the 2017 Geneva International Motor Show. \nPositioned between the Skoda Fabia and Skoda Octavia, the Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback are in the class of compact cars and set the benchmark for spaciousness among the direct competition. Compact on the outside, they boast a tremendous amount of space on the inside. Now both models have been optimized \nNewly designed front and rear \nThe visual enhancement of the Skoda Rapid is particularly evident at the front. The modified fog lights shine in the newly designed lower part of the bumper. A narrow chrome strip (standard from Style up) connects the lights and creates a wider-looking front end. Black-tinted covers on the taillights in the distinctive C-shape (Skoda Rapid LED technology as an option) give the rear an even sportier look. The Skoda Rapid Spaceback now also features an extended rear window. The boot door, popular for its size and width, makes it easy to load the luggage compartment. The side view on both models is characterized by the long wheelbase and the coupe-like silhouette, with a sharp tornado line creating an interplay of light and shadow. 2017 Skoda Rapid \nThe wheels are available in new designs: COSTA for the size 15 inch, EVORA (silver) and VIGO (silver / black metallic) for the size 16 inch, TRIUS (silver), and TORINO (black polished, for the Monte Carlo edition) the size 17 inch. \nNew intelligent lights \nThe main headlights of the Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback now shine with bi-xenon lights, the daytime running light uses LED technology. The Light Assistant completes the programme: It activates the daytime running light with the ignition. A sensor then continually measures the light conditions and switches the headlights on or off automatically. This applies to both twilight and driving through tunnels. A predetermined time for brightness can be set using the Coming Home and Leaving Home functions. The vehicle environment is illuminated so that the passengers can safely get in our out. \nFinally, the high-beam assistant always ensures optimal illumination of the road. In the dark and at speeds above 60 km/h, the sensor detects vehicles ahead (up to a distance of 400 meters), as well as on-coming traffic (up to 1,000 meters) and dims the lights as appropriate. \nBenchmark for spaciousness \nThe interior of the upgraded Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback features many design changes. Firstly, new inlays have been added to the four doors. The air nozzles in the dashboard, the instruments and the control panel of the manual air-conditioning system have also been redesigned. \nThe compact exterior dimensions and the comparatively spacious interior make the Skoda Rapid (4.48 meters long, 1.71 meters wide, 1.46 meters high) and the Skoda Rapid Spaceback (4.30 meters long, 1.71 meters wide 1.46 meters high) extremely popular with families. The interior seats up to five passengers. The headroom in the rear of the Skoda Rapid has a generous 972 millimetres (Skoda Rapid Spaceback: 980 millimetres), the legroom in both models is 65 millimetres. With a capacity of 550 litres (Skoda Rapid Spaceback: 415 litres), the boot volume of the Skoda Rapid sets the benchmark among the competition. \nNew: dynamic and efficient three-cylinder TSI engines \nAs part of the upgrade, a 1.0-litre TSI engine is now available for the Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback. Responsiveness and efficiency characterise the three-cylinder, which is available in two power levels: Skoda Rapid 1.0 TSI with 70 kW (95 PS), top speed of 187 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 11,0 sec., consumption combined 4,4 l/100 km, CO2 101 g/km 1.0 TSI with 81 kW (110 PS), top speed of 200 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 9,8 sec., consumption combined 4,5 l/100 km, CO2 104 g/km. Skoda Rapid Spaceback 1.0 TSI with 70 kW (95 PS), top speed of 184 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 11,0 sec., consumption combined 4,4 l/100 km, CO2 101 g/km 1.0 TSI with 81 kW (110 PS), top speed of 198 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 9,8 sec., consumption combined 4,5 l/100 km, CO2 104 g/km. \nThe new petrol engine combines numerous advantages: Thanks to the compact design and the aluminium crankcase, it weighs ten kilograms less than the 1.2-litre unit used previously, and runs particularly quietly. On account of the low free-inertia forces, a balance shaft, which would otherwise be used in a three-cylinder, is not required. This reduces the weight and helps to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The oil pump achieves the same effect with a flow-adjustable output; the required oil pressure is continuously adapted to the engine load. The intercooler turbocharger is integrated into the intake manifold, which means that the charge pressure spontaneously builds up. \nIn addition to the two 1.0 TSI, three other engines are available for the Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback. All powertrains are equipped with brake energy recovery, a start-stop system and meet the EU6 emission standard. The diesel engines operate with direct common-rail injection and diesel particulate filters. The following are available: Skoda Rapid 1.4 TSI with 92 kW (125 hp), top speed of 208 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 9,0 sec., consumption combined 4.8 l/100 km, CO2 113 g/km. 1.4 TDI with 66 kW (90 hp), top speed of 185 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 11,7 sec., consumption combined 3,9 l/100 km, CO2 103 g/km. 1.6 TDI with 85 kW (116 hp), top speed of 201 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 10,0 sec., consumption combined 4,1 l/100 km, CO2 107 g/km. Skoda Rapid Spaceback 1.4 TSI with 92 kW (125 hp), top speed of 205 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 8,9 sec., consumption combined 4.8 l/100 km, CO2 113 g/km. 1.4 TDI with 66 kW (90 hp), top speed of 183 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 11,6 sec., consumption combined 3,9 l/100 km, CO2 103 g/km. 1.6 TDI with 85 kW (116 hp), top speed of 198 km/h, 0 - 100 km/h in 9,9 sec., consumption combined 4,1 l/100 km, CO2 107 g/km. \nSkoda Connect - WLAN hotspot and help at the touch of a button \nPassengers in the upgraded Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback are always online thanks to the WLAN hotspot. The new Skoda Connect services consist of Infotainment Online and CareConnect services. Infotainment Online is the online traffic information, which transmits the traffic flow on the selected route in real time and suggests a traffic jam route. Other available information consist of fuel stations including current fuel prices, parking spaces, current news and weather. \nCareConnect services support the driver in many situations, and are available for all equipment variants and the Amundsen and Swing infotainment systems. The data is transferred via a permanently integrated SIM card. The offer includes the automatic emergency call, which can be used to establish a connection to an emergency call centre or operated manually even after a restraint system has been triggered. \nThe CareConnect services also include a breakdown call function, which can be used to arrange help when needed or answer questions on vehicle technology, and the Proactive Service. This makes it possible to transfer maintenance-relevant vehicle data to the Skoda workshop in good time before a service. Via the Skoda Connect app on the smartphone, at any time the driver can remotely access vehicle information, find out whether the windows, doors or sunroof are closed, and view the fuel gauge of the Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback. In addition, it is possible to send navigation information to the car and display the current parking position of the vehicle on the smartphone. \nThe music and navigation systems of the Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback are based on the second-generation modular infotainment kit. Features such as the Skoda surround system, Bluetooth hands-free kit and an Apple-compatible USB port come as standard or are available as options. The smartphone interface SmartLink+, which supports Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, MirrorLinkTM and SmartGate standards, can also be used with the Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback display. \nComprehensive active and passive safety \nThe Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback continue to feature a wide range of safety systems: The electronic stabilization control ESC and a continual tyre-pressure monitoring, for example, come as standard. They also feature the multi-collision brake, which, in the event of an accident, reduces the risk of multiple collisions by preventing the continuous rolling of the vehicle. The trailer-stabilization programme expands the electronic stabilization control. \nModern assistance systems, such as fatigue detection and Front Assist, including city emergency braking function, are also available for both models. Optional features, such as fog lamps with integrated cornering light and Hill-Climb Assist increase the active safety level. The park distance control for front and rear ensures comfort and safety. \nThe passive safety systems protect the occupants in the event of an impact, inter alia, with six airbags in the front, side and head area, as well as height-adjustable three-point safety belts with belt tensioners as standard. KESSY provides even more comfort. The abbreviation stands for the keyless entry and start-stop system. By touching the sensor on the door handle, the vehicle unlocks or locks automatically. The 'Start/Stop Engine' button starts or stops the engine. \n'Simply Clever': two additional USB ports in the rear \nSkoda is known for its numerous 'Simply Clever' solutions. Ideas that make passengers' journey on board even more enjoyable. The new additions to the upgraded Skoda Rapid and Skoda Rapid Spaceback include two USB ports in the back, which can be used to charge smartphones or other small mobile devices. Furthermore, the following practical details can be found in the vehicle (standard or optional): ice scraper in the fuel tank cover, boot mat - one side carpet, the other rubber, a holder for the hi-viz vest under the driver's seat, umbrella in the compartment under the passenger seat, portable waste container, USB port and multimedia holders in the centre console, ticket holder on the windshield, various cup holders, nets on the reverse of the front seats and a net programme for the boot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:37:19.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
