King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 0 \nAlternative Press has received an official confirmation that As I Lay Dying frontman Tim Lambesis was released from prison in December after receiving a 6-year jail sentence in February 2014 for hiring a hitman to murder his wife. \nThe source reports: \"When AP reached out to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to find out if Lambesis was still confined in a California prison, a representative confirmed that he was discharged December 17, 2016. He was discharged to the Division of Adult Parole Operations.\" \nThe news was initially revealed by Dokken guitairst George Lynch, whose daughter was once engaged to As I Lay Dying guitarist Nick Hipa. \nLynch told Eddie Trunk: \"[Lambesis] just got out of jail for attempting to kill his wife. Now I'm not saying this as an indictment against anything. \n\"All I'm saying is, there is a guy who could argue Christianity beyond anybody I've ever spoken to in my life; I had these very heated debates with this guy... He had a beautiful wife; they had adopted three Cambodian children. And then he discovered cocaine, strippers, heroin and steroids. He went completely off the rails, abandoned his family, his wife threatened to divorce him, he hired an off-duty cop to kill her. \n\"He recently got out of jail. He destroyed his band. They don't have a pot to piss in now; they're all struggling. They are a great band. I know them very well because the guitar player was my daughter's fiance. And the drummer [Jordan Mancino] played in another project I had ways back, Souls of We. \n\"So, anyways, he's out, he's got a mega record deal, he's got a book deal, everything's lined up for him. I mean, he's gonna skate through life. Everybody else is suffering. His wife is living in fear, his children are living in fear. His band doesn't have a pot to piss in.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:01:58.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
