How a “Wishing Tree” in Seattle Has Become a Beacon of Hope for the Community Sara Lindberg Image Source: The Wishing Tree Seattle \nImagine, if you can, a place that provides both peace and inspiration to all who visit. A place where hope is found and wishes are endless. For thousands of people who travel by a special tree in the Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, that’s exactly what they’ll find. \nThe Wishing Tree , as it’s come to be called, is a place where strangers bare their souls and reveal their deepest wishes and desires, all scribbled on small pieces of paper hung from its branches. And while this particular tree has only been holding wishes for a few years now, the concept of wishing trees has actually been around for centuries. \nThe Seattle tree was started by a woman named Jane who owns the house where the tree stands, with its branches hanging over onto the street. It has quickly become a gathering spot and safe place for the Capital Hill community, where locals stop by to make wishes of their own and read the quirky, beautiful, sweet, and sometimes even heart-wrenching messages of others. \nIt all began back in November 2014, when Jane decided to set out little cards and Sharpies next to a giant tree outside her home, and invite people to write down their wishes and share what they wanted most in life. Before long, there were thousands of wishes hanging from that special tree.

Most are honest and sincere and seem to resonate with the people who stop to read them. \n“There is something about this tree that inspires you to stop and take a moment,” says Jane.

And for those that watch others take part, it can be incredibly moving to witness what happens for people who have lost that space.

She found him standing in front of tree one day, just staring at the thousands of wishes swaying in the wind, and asked how he was doing and what he thought of the tree. \n“Well that’s a lot of pressure,” he began. “You just look at the tree and all those wishes and wonder which one to pick for yourself to share … I am 85 and there is a lot in there,” he continued, referring to his heart. Image Source: The Wishing Tree Seattle \nIt’s easy to see how the tree is of service to so many. \n“It’s very touching to come upon someone who is in that moment — it’s similar to a prayer, and it’s like people are connecting with this place inside of themselves and I think this space allows them to access what is real for them and what’s in their heart,” says Jane. “It allows them to say things they would never say to another person — they can say it to the tree and give it over like a prayer,” she adds.

Rather, it’s a symbol of inspiration to show that everybody can do a little something to help others out. \nIn fact, those in the neighborhood have donated time and supplies to help keep the wishes alive. When Pacific Northwest rain threatened to ruin the wishes, a neighbor showed up with a laminator to protect the cards, and someone else placed a beautiful stone bench for people to sit on.

Image Source: The Wishing Tree Seattle \n“These wishes are real and from the heart, because this is the stuff that people are living every day,” explains Jane. \nAnd it’s those experiences that remind us our intentions and prayers can create great kindness and beauty. Because after all, something magical happens when we all wish in one place.
