Despite being the only Wall-E unit left on the abandoned Earth, he continues to spend his days fulfilling his trash-compacting duties. He’s able to find joy in his work even after doing it for centuries, and he sees beauty in cockroaches and stars alike.\nID: 10610120 2. Tiana ( The Princess and the Frog ) View this image ›\nDisney Tiana is one of the most positive, proactive examples of what it means to be a ‘Puff. Tiana is brutally honest and fair-minded, devoted to her family, and endlessly hardworking. Though her ambition may be a bit Slytherin, she never loses sight of what’s important, and she refuses to give up Naveen when Facilier promises her everything she’s ever wanted in return.\nID: 10610127 3. Quasimodo ( The Hunchback of Notre Dame ) View this image ›\nDisney In spite of his upbringing, Quasimodo is a kind, gentle soul. Quasi fights his loyalties to Frollo throughout the film, and he ultimately defies the villainous judge to save his friends.\nID: 10610135 4. Flounder ( The Little Mermaid ) View this image ›\nDisney Ariel’s sidekick Flounder is not the bravest of companions, but what he lacks in courage he makes up for in dependability. Often the (slightly terrified) voice of reason on Ariel’s adventures, Flounder nevertheless stays by her side through thick and thin.\nID: 10610147 5. Sally ( The Nightmare Before Christmas ) View this image ›\nDisney Sally is loyal to Jack Skellington even when she knows he’s wrong about Christmas. Her soft-spoken voice is overshadowed through much of the film by Jack’s over-the-top personality, but she remains strong in her convictions and is ultimately proven right.\nID: 10610155 6. Kristoff ( Frozen ) View this image ›\nDisney Kristoff is perhaps the surliest Disney Hufflepuff, and he isn’t overly eager to help Anna when she asks him to take her up the mountain to find Elsa. His frosty exterior eventually melts away to reveal that he’s actually a warm-hearted hero who’s willing to sacrifice his own happiness for the woman he loves.\nID: 10610169 7. Dory ( Finding Nemo and Finding Dory ) View this image ›\nDisney Staying positive in the face of adversity is the mark of a true Hufflepuff, and Dory never loses her pep when things go wrong. Dory is always there to lend a fin and remind everyone around her to just keep swimming.\nID: 10610178 8. Snow White ( Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ) View this image ›\nDisney Another Hufflepuff princess, Snow White is no stranger to hard work, and she embraces whatever task is before her with a smile and a song. She quickly befriends the dwarves and wins them over with kindness and delicious baked goods.\nID: 10610197 9. Nakoma ( Pocahontas ) View this image ›\nDisney Pocahontas’s best friend Nakoma is more reserved than her free-spirited friend, and she provides a much needed dose of reality when Pocahontas begins to lose herself in her daydreams. She’s also super into Kocoum even though he’s no fun. Same, girl.\nID: 10610204 10. Bellweather ( Zootopia ) View this image ›\nDisney Although Hufflepuff has produced the fewest dark wizards of any Hogwarts house, that doesn’t mean it hasn’t had a couple of bad eggs along the way. While it appeared that Bellweather was seeking equality for prey animals in the beginning, she ended up being quite the corrupting force in Zootopia.\nID: 10610211 11. Geppetto ( Pinocchio ) View this image ›\nDisney Geppetto lovingly crafts himself a child out of wood, and he brings Pinocchio to life only to have him disappear.

Fix-It Felix ( Wreck-It Ralph ) View this image ›\nDisney Fix-It Felix may be a gentleman, but that doesn’t stop him from rolling up his sleeves and employing some good old fashioned elbow grease when someone needs his help. Felix’s honey glow cheeks and can-do attitude make him a pure ‘Puff.\nID: 10610241 Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?
