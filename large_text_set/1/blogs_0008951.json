The existence of the information, organized as an appendix to the highly classified intelligence briefing, has been known among journalists and officials in Washington but was first publicly reported Tuesday by CNN . Buzzfeed News later published a copy of the unverified documents. Slideshow Evan Vucci/AP \nPresident-elect Donald Trump will hold his first press conference in 168 days on Wednesday in New York City, a forum in which he's expected to address how he'll disentangle himself from his sprawling business interests and outline the initial actions he'll take when he becomes commander-in-chief next week.But given the extended period of time that's elapsed since he last faced a room full of reporters, the topics will extend far and wide, handing Trump an opportunity to put some issues to rest, spark new controversies – or both.Here's the U.S. News checklist of what to watch for when the president-elect takes the podium at Trump Tower. About That Russia Thing   \nEven after U.S. intelligence officials released a declassified assessment stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to \"denigrate Secretary [Hillary] Clinton and harm her electability,\" Trump has been resistant to the notion that Moscow's cyber activities and propaganda had any impact on the ultimate results.\"There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,\" he said in a statement last week. Why Clinton lost can and will be debated for years to come – and there likely isn't one singular factor that led to her defeat. And Trump is correct to say that the election itself wasn't hacked; it was Democratic officials' emails that were stolen and released. But he has yet to openly say he even accepts the joint conclusions of the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency, most likely because he believes doing so would tarnish his victory. Because of this defiance, Trump surely will be pressed about his confidence in the intelligence community on a broader scale, since trust will be necessary in order for him to make crucial decisions tied to the nation's security. If he is skeptical of its conclusions on Russian intrusions, will that wariness carry over to the agencies' other judgments? A Clean Business Break?   \nRemember, it's not just Trump himself who is being confronted with conflicts of interest regarding his fleet of hotels, apartments and golf courses that span the globe. It's his family members, who are expected to be integral Oval Office advisers.Jared Kushner, the quiet but powerful 36-year-old son-in-law who was instrumental to the campaign, will be a senior adviser in the West Wing . His wife and Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, also will inevitably influence her father's decisions, even if she declines a formal title.Reports indicate that Kushner will resign his role overseeing his own real estate empire and divest \"many, many\" of his assets. But if some wind up with other family members, like his brother and mother, there will be valid questions about whether the dispossession is even meaningful. Ivanka Trump, who already has sat in on a transition meeting with Japan's prime minister, is stepping away from the Trump Organization and her global fashion brand, leaving control of the former to her brothers, Don Jr. and Eric. The president-elect has promised the sons won't cut any new deals while he's in office, but has also downplayed potential problems, explaining that Americans knew all about his global businesses before they sent him to transform Washington. Given the press conference has been delayed by a month, Trump will be expected to have a detailed explanation as to how he'll prevent influence-peddling by foreign and domestic actors, who could court him on a policy issue by sweetening a current or future business transaction. Democrats already have set the bar for what they expect.\"If President-elect Trump announces anything short of full and complete divestment at his press conference [Wednesday], he will leave a cloud of suspicion hanging over his administration,\" Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin said in a statement. Repeal and Replace?   \nIt's the most significant emerging conundrum for Republicans on Capitol Hill: how to make good on their relentless promise to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law without completely blowing up something 20 million Americans have gotten newly accustomed to.While Obamacare has been a meddlesome boondoggle in the eyes of many voters due to its coverage requirements and impact on premiums, the GOP knows that many individual provisions – like prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions – remain very popular. And killing it all without a backup plan is causing apprehension even among some Republicans , like Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, both of whom hail from rural, poorer states.GOP leaders on Capitol Hill are hoping Trump weighs in to begin framing the specific constructs of what elements should be included in a replacement policy.\"The president-elect can say, 'This is what my replacement looks like' and then Congress will get behind it,\" one top GOP Senate aide says. \"Politically, that's how it happens. He needs to drive it.\"Trump, according to The New York Times , said Tuesday that a replacement should follow any repeal \"very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter,\" but he did not detail what exact principles should be included in legislation. It's unclear if Trump will commit to any new level of detail on Wednesday, but he's already warned his party it must \"be careful\" with the delicate politics of taking it away from voters. \"Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium hikes,\" Trump tweeted last week. \"Don't let the [Chuck] Schumer clowns out of this web.\" Tempered Trump or Twitter Trump? (Evan Vucci/AP Photo) \nEven as he constantly complains about \"dishonest\" coverage, Trump revels in mixing it up with reporters, parrying his responses into zingers, indelible facial expressions or pithy put-downs.But just nine days from taking the oath of office, Trump's demeanor will be under more acute scrutiny than ever before. He has said that he would become \"presidential\" once he won the campaign. And now that the election is in the rearview mirror, even many of his allies will be looking for a more refined, restrained approach that's appropriate for the office.When presented with onerous questions, will he take the bait and lash out like he often does on Twitter? Or will he show the discipline to resist escalating petty disputes with critics, even if it involves a celebrity ?Wednesday's press conference will not only preview his relationship with the media, but it will demonstrate if he actually intends on modulating his impulsive disposition as he transitions from unruly renegade candidate to 45th U.S. president. x of x \nIntelligence officials reportedly added the information to their briefings – which included leaders in Congress and the intelligence committees known as \"The Gang of Eight\" – because they were concerned it would leak before they had a chance verify it. It is rare they would include unverified information in a briefing of this magnitude. \nShortly after the news broke, Trump tweeted \"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\" \nThe reports came after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Friday released a declassified version of the classified briefing provided to the president and president-elect. \nOthers on Capitol Hill began indicating publicly on Tuesday that there was more information to be released. At a hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden asked FBI Director James Comey repeatedly if there was any investigation into potential conflicts of interest between the Trump campaign and Russia. Comey repeatedly told the Oregon Democrat he would not comment on any investigations that are or aren't ongoing. \nThe unverified information in the report includes claims that Russian covert surveillance documented Trump performing lewd sexual acts with prostitutes at a hotel in Moscow and that Russian agents had proposed to him lucrative deals that amounted to bribes in order to gain influence over him.
