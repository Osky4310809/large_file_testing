And with more orders to come, Trump opponents are suddenly dusting off their law books to see just how much executive power he has to play with.\nBut what if Trump woke up as the prime minister of Canada? What kind of unilateral power would he have then?\nWith the assistance of Ottawa-based Westminster expert Philippe Lagassé (who probably had better things to do), the National Post presents this guide to how much our head of government is legally allowed to get away with. Buckle up, reader. It turns out we’ve got some crazy rules in this country. \nA majority government prime minister is essentially a dictator \nIn his 2001 book, author Jeffrey Simpson called Canada a “friendly dictatorship.” During the years of U.S. president Barack Obama, U.S. right-wingers were fond of noting that Stephen Harper was the most powerful conservative in the Western Hemisphere. These observations underlie a simple fact: When a Canadian prime minister heads up a majority government that routinely votes his or her way, the only true limit to their power is the Supreme Court and/or rebellious city and provincial governments. Harper fully ensured that marijuana dispensaries were illegal, but the City of Vancouver decided to simply not act on it. Similarly, Justin Trudeau can impose a carbon tax on Saskatchewan, but Premier Brad Wall could simply rebate every dollar collected from it.\nRelated The early days of President Trump: Insiders rethink tactics after series of stumbles ‘Brewing power struggle’: Ivanka’s moderating influence giving way to extremist Steve Bannon, sources say He can kill TPP, he (might) be able to kill NAFTA: What Trump can — and cannot — do with a stroke of his pen Say a prime minister goes crazy, what is there to stop them? \nLet’s call this the Crazy Prime Minister Scenario: We wake up one morning and Justin Trudeau is appearing in an emergency broadcast to outline how he’s abandoning all his other prime ministerial duties in order to focus exclusively on fighting invisible leprechauns. Within seconds, everyone in Ottawa is suddenly scrambling to figure out how to get rid of him. In ideal circumstances, the Crazy Prime Minister is simply shunted out the door in one of those caucus coups that the British and Australians are so fond of. But the caucus coup is still dependent on a shunned leader politely deciding to resign. The Crazy Prime Minister, however, can simply prorogue parliament, dismiss the cabinet and begin filling civil service positions with compliant lackeys. At that point, the only thing the (prorogued) House of Commons can do is to withhold funding. Eventually, Prime Minister Crazy is going to run out of money. And when they convene parliament to get a budget bill, their joyride will come to an end with a vote of non-confidence.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left, speaks with Governor General David Johnston following the speech from the throne in the Senate Chamber on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Dec. 4, 2015. Can the Governor General save us? \nYes, in fact. The Governor General currently ranks among the most useless government jobs in Canada — but the office suddenly becomes very important if a maniac gets into the PMO. All of a prime minister’s executive powers are funnelled through the Governor General. Stephen Harper could have technically ordered a unilateral invasion of Mexico at a moment’s notice. But, if he had staggered into Rideau Hall reeking of ouzo and holding a cocktail napkin scrawled with the words “Mexico war planz,” the hope is that David Johnston would have fired him and appointed a new prime minister. And here’s the weird thing: Almost anyone can be appointed prime minister of Canada. There is nothing in the rules that says you have to be a parliamentarian; you’re just supposed to be someone who commands the “confidence of the House.” Just ask William Lyon Mackenzie King, who lost his seat in the 1925 election but remained prime minister anyway. What all this means is that if the House of Commons suddenly decided tomorrow that Don Cherry is the only one they trust to lead Canada, there is literally no legal reason he could not be made prime minister within 24 hours.\nPat McGrath/Postmedia Network The only person who can truly bind up the nation's wounds in times of crisis. The nightmare scenario: A prime minister goes crazy the day after appointing a crazy Governor General \nThere is some precedent for a Queen’s representative putting the brakes on a government leader. In the early 1990s, B.C. Lieutenant-Governor David Lam said he was fully prepared to fire scandal-plagued B.C. premier Bill Vander Zalm (it was ultimately a moot point, since Vander Zalm resigned). But there’s a loophole: David Johnston, Adrienne Clarkson and Michaëlle Jean all got their jobs because a prime minister recommended them to the post. And thus, we have the Achilles heel of Canadian democracy: If a prime minister manages to get their drinking buddy into Rideau Hall, they’ve suddenly got an all-powerful duumvirate. This duumvirate can’t make any new laws without the House of Commons, but they’ve got a whole treasure chest of executive powers. For instance, they could extend clemency to a bunch of violent criminals and appoint them as foreign ambassadors. Or they could fill vacant Senate seats exclusively with men named “I.P. Freely.” But here again, the PM-GG duo is still limited by cash. The duumvirate’s rampage is ultimately checked by how long Canada can limp along until it goes broke.\nBruce Stotesbury/Postmedia Network Bill Vander Zalm. His appearance in an article about 'crazy' political leaders is purely coincidental. And yes, Queen Elizabeth can still technically fire a rogue prime minister \nAll those pictures of Queen Elizabeth on the money are there for a reason: She’s still Canada’s head of state, and is technically the vessel from which all power flows. The Queen, in turn, avoids the violent fate of her French and Russian cousins by staying out of politics as much as humanly possible. However, if Canada suddenly found itself in the grip of a duumvirate, we still have the legal option of begging the Queen to fix everything. Presumably, a (preferably multi-party) delegation would fly to London, curtsy and request an audience with Her Majesty. If the Queen sympathized with the plight of her Canadian subjects, she would then tear up a 1947 document signed by her father (King George VI) which effectively handed the powers of the Crown to Canada’s Governor General. Then, with the Governor General thus neutered, the Queen would pick a new prime minister to fix everything and hopefully never bother her again.\nChris Jackson/Getty Images At an International Fleet Review in Halifax in 2010, Queen Elizabeth II visits with some of the thousands of Canadians technically sworn to do whatever she says. What about the RCMP and the military in all this? \nTherein is the key difference between the U.S. and Canada. When Donald Trump watches columns of marching troops, he knows that they are all sworn to act on his orders alone. As a fictional Richard Nixon says in his eponymous 1995 biopic, “the president can bomb anybody he likes.” But when Justin Trudeau watches a formation of fighter jets scream overhead, he knows that the men and women at the controls are beholden to a lady in London who enjoys corgis. It’s the same deal with the RCMP, who similarly swear an oath to “Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her heirs and successors.” So, Canada could conceivably get to the point where a power-mad, spittle-flecked prime minister has declared themselves supreme ruler and barricaded themselves inside 24 Sussex. Meanwhile, an entire House of Commons has challenged his power by getting a “you’re fired” note from the Queen. If that happens, rest assured that the government employees with guns are supposed to obey the people with the Queen note.\n• Email: thopper@nationalpost.com | Twitter: TristinHopper \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:58:45.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
