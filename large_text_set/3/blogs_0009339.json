The two tech titans, one of whom is currently embroiled in a massive sexism scandal, were either unconcerned or unaware that the party was themed as a “Babes & Balls Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” \nAnd if they were actually unaware, it’s only because they ignored all the signs—at least one of which was a literal sign on Facebook. \nThe party was held less than a week before Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are pregnant with a second baby girl. “We are all better people because of the the strong women in our lives—sisters, mothers and friends,” he wrote on Facebook yesterday. \nWe imagine Mark drafted that post between rounds Friday at SPiN. Perhaps he found inspiration in all the babes? Or was it the balls? Maybe the breakfast. Either way, photos make clear that the Zuck was clearly pondering the ramifications of raising two girls in a world where women make .79 cents on the dollar. Kalanick, on the other hand, has the face of someone who keeps his eyes on the ball—just so long as that ball doesn’t involve months and months of complaints about a negligent Uber HR team. Helps, too, if the ball in question is grey. Travis Kalanick, probably not thinking about Susan Fowler Rigetti, shown here. \nBut you’ve gotta hand it to the two of them: Who would’ve thought the way to address years of reported sexism in Silicon Valley would be to literally celebrate it?
