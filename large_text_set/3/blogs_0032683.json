In the process of spinning containerd out of Docker and contributing it to CNCF there are a few changes that come along with it. For starters, containerd now has a logo; see below. In addition, we have a new @containerd twitter handle. In the next few days, we’ll be moving the containerd GitHub repository to a separate GitHub organization. Similarly, the containerd slack channel will be moved to separate slack team which will soon available at containerd.slack.com containerd has been extracted from Docker’s container platform and includes methods for transferring container images, container execution and supervision and low-level local storage, across both Linux and Windows. containerd is an essential upstream component of the Docker platform used by millions of end users that also provides the industry with an open, stable and extensible base for building non-Docker products and container solutions. “Our decision to contribute containerd to the CNCF closely follows months of collaboration and input from thought leaders in the Docker community,” said Solomon Hykes, founder, CTO and Chief Product Officer at Docker. “Since our announcement in December, we have been progressing the design of the project with the goal of making it easily embedded into higher level systems to provide core container capabilities. Our focus has always been on solving users’ problems. By donating containerd to an open foundation, we can accelerate the rate of innovation through cross-project collaboration – making the end user the ultimate benefactor of our joint efforts.” The donation of containerd aligns with Docker’s history of making key open source plumbing projects available to the community. This effort began in 2014 when the company open sourced libcontainer . Over the past two years, Docker has continued along this path by making libnetwork , notary , runC (contributed to the Open Container Initiative, which like CNCF, is part of The Linux Foundation), HyperKit , VPNKit , DataKit , SwarmKit a n d InfraKit available as open source projects as well. containerd is already a key foundation for Kubernetes, as Kubernetes 1.5 runs with Docker 1.10.3 to 1.12.3. There is also strong alignment with other CNCF projects: containerd exposes an API using gRPC and exposes metrics in the Prometheus format. containerd also fully leverages the Open Container Initiative’s (OCI) runtime, image format specifications and OCI reference implementation ( runC ), and will pursue OCI certification when it is available. A proof of concept for integrating containerd directly into Kubernetes CRI is currently being worked on. Check out the pull request on github for more technical details. Figure 1: containerd’s role in the Container Ecosystem Community consensus leads to technical progress In the past few months, the containerd team has been active implementing Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the containerd roadmap . Details about the project can be charted in the containerd weekly development reports posted in the Github project. At the end of February, Docker hosted the containerd Summit with more than 50 members of the community from companies including Alibaba, AWS, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat and VMware. The group gathered to learn more about containerd, get more information on containerd’s progress and discuss its design. To view the presentations, check out the containerd summit recap blog post . The target date to finish implementing the containerd 1.0 roadmap is June 2017. To contribute to containerd, or embed it into a container system, check out the project on GitHub . If you want to learn more about containerd progress, or discuss its design, join the team in Berlin tomorrow at KubeCon 2017 for the containerd Salon , or Austin for DockerCon Day 4 Thursday April 20th , as the Docker Internals Summit morning session will be a containerd summit.
