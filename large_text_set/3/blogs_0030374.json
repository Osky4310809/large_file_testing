In a decision recently signed by Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales, Refol was found administratively guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct for fathering a child with his mistress. Based on the investigation by Ombudsman-Visayas' Public Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office, Refol maintained an illicit relationship with another woman despite being married. The ombudsman cited a report of the National Bureau of Investigation-Western Visayas Regional Office which said that Refol's illicit relationship was already “public knowledge in the municipality because respondent publicly displayed the same.” The ombudsman initiated a fact-finding investigation on Refol's extramarital affairs following a tip by an anonymous complainant. In a certificate of live birth obtained by the fact-finding team, Refol supposedly acknowledged paternity of a child born in 2007. The ombudsman found no merit in Refol's claim that he had already stopped seeing his mistress, making the complaint moot and academic. The ombudsman likewise dismissed Refol's defense that “at present, there are only a few public officials who have no mistresses.” “The respondent has not denied the relationship despite the subsistence of his marriage or the fact that he has fathered a child with the woman,” the ombudsman's resolution read. Morales directed the Department of the Interior and Local Government to implement the suspension. Disgraceful and immoral conduct is defined as “an act which violates the basic norm of decency, morality and decorum, abhorred and condemned by the society and conduct which is willful, flagrant or shameless, and which shows a moral indifference to the opinions of the good and respectable members of the community”.
