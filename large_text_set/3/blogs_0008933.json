It would also decrease the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA, which provides relief after natural disasters, by 11 percent to $3.6 billion. \n“It’s a little bit like putting an extra lock on the front door and none on the back door,” Michael Chertoff, who led the Homeland Security Department for four years, told the New York Times . “You are not really protecting the house.” \nThe Coast Guard has played a central role in cracking down on the drug trade and piracy, while the TSA has been on the first line of defense against 9/11-style attacks. \nThese cuts would eliminate several programs within the TSA that have been central to the U.S. counterterrorism effort, including training for pilots in the event of an armed takeover, a grant program for law enforcement patrols at airports, and a program that sends undercover and visible agents to conduct sweeps of airports and train stations, according to the same Times report. \nMoney for these programs and others would instead be diverted to beefing up the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as building the wall on the southern border with Mexico. Around $1.9 billion would go to ICE and $2.9 billion would be dedicated to building the wall, the Washington Post reported .
