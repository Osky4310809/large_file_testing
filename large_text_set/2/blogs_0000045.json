Getty Mariel Tyler By Melissa Locker Jan 31, 2017 \nWe all need some self-care to get through these tumultuous times, and that can come in the form of a massage, flowers, or the perfect playlist. Luckily, there's an assortment of new albums coming out in February that will rival heart-shaped boxes in helping get you through. \nThis month there's stunning new music from Big Sean, Bebe Rexha, Syd, Ryan Adams, and more. Here are ten songs you'll be listening to all February long. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Syd, \"All About Me\" \nThe Internet's Syd Tha Kyd is ready to take the spotlight. The former Odd Future member comes out swinging on her debut solo album, Fin , which is out February 3. She has opened up about her struggles with depression in the public eye and seems to be working it all out on her album with songs like \"Drown In It\" and \"Insecurities.\" The lead single, \"All About Me,\" produced by the Internet's Steve Lacy, pairs Syd's vocals with funk, soul, and a trap beat for an unforgettable song. Thundercat feat. Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins, \"Show You the Way\" \nYou may not know Thundercat yet, but he's your favorite artist's favorite bassist. When you hear his new album, he'll be your favorite, too. The Grammy-winning musician's next album, Drunk , comes out February 24 and features appearances from Kendrick Lamar, Wiz Khalifa, Kamasi Washington, and Pharrell. The first single features former Steely Dan singer Michael McDonald and '80s legend Kenny Loggins, who Thundercat claims is his favorite songwriter. Be as skeptical as you like; it's a fearsome combination. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Dirty Projectors, \"Up in Hudson\" \nThe band known as Dirty Projectors is evolving. Singer Amber Coffman is gone and David Longstreth has written an ode to their relationship, from hopeful beginnings to the not-quite-bitter end. From the forthcoming self-titled album, \"Up in Hudson\" is filled with lovelorn yearning, with Longstreth singing, \"We're going our separate ways, but we're still connected.\" The song is a beautiful, horn-tinged Valentine to lost love and is convincing evidence that this new iteration of Dirty Projectors is worth a whirl. Sinkane, \"Television\" \nSinkane is the ever-morphing project from New York-based musician and producer Ahmed Gallab, who makes what he calls \"feel-good music for trying times.\" The latest single, \"Television,\" fully fits the bill, with a transporting beat (yes—take us away, please). The album, Life & Livin' It (out February 10) , comes after Gallab spent a year traveling the world leading Nigerian electro-legend William Onyeabor's The Atomic Bomb Band, which also included David Byrne, Damon Albarn, and members of Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem. The resulting global vision shines through.

He is finally ready to break out on his own with his debut album, Process , set for release on February 3. The first single from the album reveals how thoughtful and downright gorgeous his music can be. Titled \"(No One Knows Me) Like The Piano,\" the song is a heartfelt tribute to Sampha's childhood piano, on which he wrote the majority of Process , bringing it all full circle. Ryan Adams, \"Do You Still Love Me?\" \nAlt-country crooner Ryan Adams started writing his new album Prisoner when he was in the middle of his divorce from Mandy Moore. Out of that personal heartbreak, he has crafted an album that will appeal to anyone who has ever had to deal with a broken relationship. Prisoner , out February 17, is filled with power ballads and lonesome tearjerkers—all featuring Adams' trademark country twang, daring songwriting, and true-blue way with words. His latest single, \"Do You Still Love Me?,\" is a fiery ode to big feelings, with a nod to the power chords of bands like AC/DC and Warrant.

Her debut solo album, All Your Fault: Pt. 1 , out February 17, puts all that songwriting prowess on display, and her fans just can't get enough—the electro-pop version of her song \"I Got You\" racked up 42 million views in just three weeks. The acoustic version of the track shows off Rexha's devastatingly insistent, addictive voice. Phantom, \"Dance\" \nThese Helsinki-based up-and-comers create dreamy, cerebral landscapes that let your imagination run wild. Think The xx meets School of Seven Bells, with a dash of M83 in the mix. The joint effort between formally trained jazz singer Hanna Toivonen and beat-maker Tommi Koskinen is fluidly electronic. \"Dance\" is a futuristic love song built on billowing melodies, soaring vocals, and icy cold beats, seamlessly blending emotion and technology. Phantom's new album, MMXII , will be available to soundtrack your dreams from February 24.

Freedom Highway , out February 24, is raw and personal, paying homage to Giddens' past and the formidable men and women that have come before her. Alongside original songs, the album includes a haunting reworking of a traditional tune and two civil rights–era songs: \"Birmingham Sunday\" and Staple Singers' well-known \"Freedom Highway.\" On \"At the Purchaser's Option,\" her haunting, powerful voice twists around the story of a young female slave whose baby is also up for sale. Big Sean feat. Chance the Rapper and Jeremih, \"Living Single\" \nFor Big Sean's latest album, I Decided , set to drop on February 3, the Detroit MC found inspiration in the idea of rebirth; the history of Motown; and artists like Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and the Temptations. He told Entertainment Weekly , \"They inspired people to have a good time, to do better—to be a better version of themselves. That really stuck with me. That's what I want to do, too.\" The new album finds Sean pairing his rhymes with old-school soul, R&B, and steady trap beats. He's already released a few singles, including the catchy \"Bounce Back\" and \"Living Single,\" which pairs the ever-quotable Sean with Chance the Rapper and Jeremih.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:19:01.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
