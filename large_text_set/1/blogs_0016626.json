Rowling's magical books series already had established careers, but many of series' main roles were filled by children who'd never appeared on screen before.\nEvanna Lynch, the Irish actress whose first IMDd credit is for Luna Lovegood in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , is one of these.\nSix years on from the release of the final Harry Potter film, though, and the close association with Luna's character seems to be taking its toll.\nOn Tuesday, Lynch shared a long post on Instagram to say that she's planning to stop going to fan conventions in a bid to push herself more creatively.\n\"I'm going to take a break from conventions after the other two I've committed to this year because I need to push myself as an artist more,\" she wrote.\n\"Sometimes life gives you an easy route that dulls your appetite for chasing your dreams and you become inhibited by fear of what lays beyond comfort and safety.\"\nHere's Lynch's post in full. My üíò @officialandel who is an actual fountain of joy, fun and wisdom and snarky comebacks. Thank you for keeping me spangly and reminding me why I'm here and inspiring some new intentions... I'm going to take a break from conventions after the other two I've committed to this year because I need to push myself as an artist more. Sometimes life gives you an easy route that dulls your appetite for chasing your dreams and you become inhibited by fear of what lays beyond comfort and safety. That for me has been living off the world I inhabited a decade ago. It's a blessing to have a safety net and while it's possible to maintain safety and chaos together I believe I need insecurity to light a fire under my scared little artist's ass. I'm different now and need to honour that and challenge myself to create something else, something from the person I am today. I feel like I'm stuck in my 18 year old self artistically when I actually have a lot more to say. I'm writing it down for myself to acknowledge and to remind myself to not be held back by fear of discovering my inabilities and inadequacies as an actor and human. What is there to lose anymore by being relentlessly optimistic about the future? I have run out of excuses and want to follow my heart wholeheartedly rather than my fear... üôèüèª\nA photo posted by Evanna Lynch (@msevylynch) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:07am PST\nSince the Harry Potter films wrapped in 2011 Lynch has nine more acting credits on her IMDb page , including a mixture of TV movies and films. Her most recent credit is for the voice of Luna Lovegood in the Lego Dimensions video game.\n\"I feel like I'm stuck in my 18-year-old self artistically when I actually have a lot more to say,\" she wrote.\n\"I'm writing it down for myself to acknowledge and to remind myself to not be held back by fear of discovering my inabilities and inadequacies as an actor and human.\"\nBONUS: Unlocking a chamber of secrets about the 'Harry Potter' movies", "external_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2121541/?ref_=nv_sr_1", "http://giphy.com/embed/GkkX3GzpeKebe?html5=true", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/WGVGqm4z.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/WGVGqm4z.m3u8", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPVh5d0jZGi/?taken-by=msevylynch&hl=en", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPVh5d0jZGi/"], "published": "2017-01-18T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T14:55:07.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
