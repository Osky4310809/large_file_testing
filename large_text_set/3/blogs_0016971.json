New bike lanes, curb extensions, crosswalks, pedestrian lighting, and added traffic lights are also planned for the area.\nFurther grant money will also fund pedestrian-friendly improvements at nearby Union Station. Part of Metroâ€™s master plan for the historic station, these updates include a pedestrian crossing on Alameda Street and other new connections between the station and its surrounding communities. The project will receive $3.15 million starting in 2019.\nOther LA-area projects set to receive state grants include a protected bikeway on Union Street in Pasadena, which will get $3.74 million; bike lane connections at Cal State Long Beach, which will receive $3.03 million; and a complete streets project at Pacific Boulevard and Vernon Ave in Vernon (it will get around $1.89 million).\nCTC Approves Regional Active Transportation Projects [Streetsblog] Southern California gets $56 million for new bike lanes, walkways [Pasadena Star News] New Sixth Street bridge will be delayed until late 2020 [Curbed LA] Union Station's Getting a New Bike- and Pedestrian-Friendly Makeover at Its Front Entrance [Curbed LA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T00:51:08.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
