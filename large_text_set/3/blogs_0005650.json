Pierson told Plott she had been offered a role in the White House , but decided on her own not to take it. \n“It was funny because, I think it might have been a week later…I called ‘em up and said, ‘You know, I’ve been thinking about it, and I think I’m gonna go over to the c4,'” she recounted. “I talked to… staff, who were very disappointed. But they understood. Everybody said, ‘Do what you feel is in your heart.’” \nBut another source in the Trump world told Plott something else entirely. They said that Pierson had been “pissed” about only being offered the deputy press secretary job, and was passed over entirely after complaining about it. \n“I love Katrina, but she was bitching to everyone that they should have chosen her and not Sean,” they said. “It got back to [ Jared Kushner and Reince Priebus ]. And they ultimately decided they just didn’t want to deal with that sort of drama. So they ‘placed’ her in the c4.” \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:25:17.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
