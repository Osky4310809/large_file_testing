Londoners' immune systems 'weakened by capital's toxic air' \nHowever, TfL said the charge gave a “strong signal” that the Mayor was prepared to make polluters pay to tackle poisonous air which contributes to the deaths of 9,400 Londoners every year. \nAnnouncing his plans last year, Mr Khan said: “I want to act before an emergency, which is why we need big, bold and sometimes difficult policies if London is to match the scale of the challenge.” \nAround 9,000 drivers a day are expected to pay the new £10 levy when it comes into force later this year, costing them an estimated £23 million. They will also pay the £11.50 congestion charge. \nLondon Assembly Conservatives warned that small businesses with older vehicles would be hit hard, facing charges of £2,600 a year or having to fork out thousands to renew their cars or vans. \nTory environment spokesman Shaun Bailey claimed the T-charge was a “pointless pollution tax” that did little to tackle poor air quality and urged Mr Khan to rethink his plans. \nHe said: “If the Mayor wants to impose a £23 million annual cost to Londoners that disproportionately affects small businesses, he needs a strong justification for doing so. \n“Unfortunately TfL’s own assessments of his T-charge show it to be little more than a vanity project that will do next to nothing to improve London’s air pollution.

It is expected to be introduced before 2020 and to be the toughest emission standard of any major city in the world. \nCity Hall insiders claimed the £23 million cost was misleading as they expected 40 per cent of motorists to switch to cleaner vehicles in the first year alone. \nMr Khan said: “The Tories should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for opposing plans, supported by environment and medical experts, businesses and Londoners to tackle air pollution that will help save Londoners' lives including children. \n“I’ve campaigned alongside the Evening Standard to improve air pollution because it’s the right thing to do. \n“The T-charge will reduce polluted emissions and will help remove the oldest, most polluting vehicles from central London’s streets - a vital first step to delivering the Ultra Low Emission Zone.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T09:49:32.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
