Having already created together winning products for the European market, we know that Opel/Vauxhall is the right partner,\" PSA Groupe Chairman Carlos Tavares said in a statement. \nSelling Opel and Vauxhall frees GM from a division that has bled money for 16 consecutive years, allowing the Detroit automaker to spend more time and money developing cars and trucks in North America and China where it is earning most of its profits and on the development off self-driving cars. \n“For GM, this represents another major step in the ongoing work that is driving our improved performance and accelerating our momentum,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. \"We are reshaping our company and delivering consistent, record results for our owners...and in new technologies that are enabling us to lead the future of personal mobility.\" \nRelated: A look at the history of Opel and Vauxhall, the European brands GM is selling \nThe deal includes all of Opel and Vauxhall’s automotive operations, including the brands, six assembly and five component-manufacturing plants an engineering center in Rüsselsheim, Germany and approximately 40,000 employees. \nPSA Groupe said it is forming a 50/50 joint venture French bank BNP Paribas to purchase and operate GM's car financing division. \nGM will retain the engineering center in Torino, Italy and will have the right to buy stock in PSA Groupe valued at $689 billion (.65 billion euro) over the next nine years. Based on a reference price of 17.34 euro the warrants correspond to about 39.7 million shares of PSA Groupe, 4.2% of the French automaker's total shares. \n“We believe this new chapter puts Opel and Vauxhall in an even stronger position for the long term and we look forward to our participation in the future success and strong value-creation potential of PSA through our economic interest and continued collaboration on current and exciting new projects,” Barra said. \nThe Detroit automaker also said it will record non-cash special charge of $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion after the transaction closes later this year. \nStill, it lowers the amount of cash GM must keep on hand by nearly $2 billion. GM said it plans to use that money to repurchase shares and other investments. \nSo far, Barra's bold move is being greeted with enthusiasm on Wall Street. GM's stock price has risen $2.71 per share, or 7.6%, to $38.23 since the since Feb. 13, the day before GM and PSA Groupe confirmed they were in discussions. \n\"Opel/Vauxhall was a profit losing puzzle no one at GM could solve for decades, and outside forces such as Brexit and an increasingly complex regulatory environment did not help the situation,\" Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book said in an email. \" \nLindland said that unloading Opel/Vauxhall allows GM to invest in growing markets such as China and India and frees up capital for further expansion into ride and car sharing and autonomous vehicles \nBarra, a lifelong GM executive, has been saying that she has been working changing the automaker's culture from a slow, plodding bureaucratic automaker into a nimble, customer centric company focused on profits. \nWhile there have been skeptics, the decision exit Europe -- on the heels of the automaker's decision to discontinue sales of mainstream Chevrolet models in Europe in 2015, to exit Russia in 2015 and end manufacturing in Australia in 2016 -- definitively sends GM into new direction. \nRelated: If it unloads European unit, General Motors could benefit \nFor PSA Groupe, the deal creates an automaker with a larger presence in Europe, giving it greater buying power. \nTavares says the goal is growth -- not retrenchment. Tavares has pulled the French automaker back from brink of bankruptcy over the past three years and now will try to use that same turnaround magic to do what GM couldn't do for nearly two decades -- make Opel and Vauxhaull profitable. \nTo cement the deal, PSA Groupe had to make promises to politicians and union leaders in Germany, Britain and Spain that to preserve jobs. \n“We are confident that the Opel/Vauxhall turnaround will significantly accelerate with our support, while respecting the commitments made by GM to the Opel/Vauxhall employees,” Tavares said. \nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.
