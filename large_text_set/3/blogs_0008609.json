Fox Sports' Peter Schrager reported the two sides agreed to a four-year deal. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport first reported the two sides had reached an agreement. Munnerlyn took to Twitter to announce his return: Captain Munnerlyn's Career Stats 0 Source: ESPN.com Munnerlyn entered the league in 2009 as a seventh-round pick out of South Carolina, but he has outplayed his draft positioning. He was a member of the Panthers from 2009-13 and the Minnesota Vikings from 2014-16. The Vikings largely used him as a nickel cornerback and as someone who could defend receivers in the slot, and Kyle Ratke of USA Today' s Vikings Wire wrote Munnerlyn previously said he wanted to return to Minnesota for the 2017 campaign. However, the Vikings selected Clemson's Mackensie Alexander in the second round of the 2016 draft and will likely give him more responsibility in Munnerlyn's place. Munnerlyn brings more than just experience to his new team. He has been notably durable throughout his career and has never played fewer than 14 games in a season. He appeared in all 16 contests in five of his eight campaigns and was one reason the Vikings finished third in the league in passing yards allowed in 2016. Munnerlyn has 11 career interceptions, five of which he returned for touchdowns. He also finished the 2016 campaign with 55 combined tackles, which marked his sixth straight season with more than 50: Captain Munnerlyn @captain_41 3/11/2017, 2:22:04 AM Pro Football Focus gave Munnerlyn a 75.5 grade in its free-agency tracker, which was the 15th-highest mark among all cornerbacks. Munnerlyn turns 29 in April, so he should have a number of productive seasons remaining after signing this deal. The tackle totals indicate he is capable of contributing to the run defense, and he has spent large portions of his career defending speedy receivers in the slot. With that talent and veteran leadership in the secondary, the Panthers will look to challenge for the postseason in 2017. The secondary was a huge weak spot for the Panthers last season due in large part to starting two rookies (Daryl Worley, James Bradberry) for a majority of their games. Carolina's defense finished with the third-highest completion percentage and fourth-most passing yards to opposing quarterbacks in 2016. Munnerlyn knows head coach Ron Rivera's system as well as any player in the NFL, having played in it from 2011-13. The cornerback should continue to play at a high level for years to come, giving the Panthers a huge boost in an area of need.
