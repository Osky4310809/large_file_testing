The remaining members claimed Cabello only informed them of her departure through her representatives, though the 19-year-old later said the accusations were “simply not true” and the four knew about her plans to pursue a solo career for months. \nThe band then fired back and revealed that the supposed “conversations” about Cabello’s exit “never happened” because the “Bad Things” singer refused to meet and discuss about it. \n— Fifth Harmony (@FifthHarmony) December 20, 2016 \n“Over the past several months we have consistently made every effort to sit down and discuss the future of Fifth Harmony with Camila. We have spent the past year and a half (since her initial solo endeavor) trying to communicate to her and her team all of the reasons why we felt Fifth Harmony deserved at least one more album of her time, given the success of this past year that we’d all worked so hard for,” they said in a joint statement. “We called for group meetings which she refused, we asked L.A. Reid and the label to step in and try to set meetings, which again, she refused. We even went as far as group counseling which she did not show up to.” 15 Photos » \n“We have tried with exhausted efforts and hearts to keep this group alive as the five of us, and we want it to be very clear that unfortunately those efforts are not mutual,” they continued. “We were truly hurt.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T08:12:04.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
