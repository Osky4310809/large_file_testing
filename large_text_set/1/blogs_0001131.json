We let them know again, and they just kept counting her down and reassuring her that they will work as soon as they go live, which never happened — at which point she pulled them out but could not hear the music over the crowd.”\n“After the show, I called [Dick Clark Productions'] Mark Shimmel and I said, ‘What the f–k happened?’ He said, ‘Let me call you back,’ then called me back and confirmed the in-ears were not working and asked if I would make a joint statement,” Stella added. “I said, ‘No way.’ I asked him to cut the West Coast feed. He said he could not do that. I asked him why would they want to run a performance with mechanical glitches unless they just want eyeballs at any expense … It’s not artist-friendly, especially when the artist cut her vacation short as a New Year’s Eve gift to them.”\nClick inside to read the statement from Dick Clark Productions refuting the claims… \nDick Clark Productions released a statement responding to the claims of sabotage being made.\n“As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists. To suggest that dcp, as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year’s Rockin’ Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. In very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television, however, an initial investigation has indicated that dcp had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey’s New Year’s Eve performance. We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge her tremendous accomplishments in the industry.”\nGet more news on what happened during Mariah ‘s NYE performance:\nFAN REACTIONS : Here is what people said on Twitter after the performance MARIAH REACTS : Here is what the singer said after the performance gone wrong ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T06:05:51.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
