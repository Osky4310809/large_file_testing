Composite: Photoshot/Central News Monday 9 January 2017 11.08 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nA crown court judge who retaliated with blunt, verbal abuse when insulted by a defendant has been cleared of judicial misconduct. \nThe widely reported exchange , which triggered complaints from the public, occurred last summer when Patricia Lynch QC informed the repeat offender John Hennigan that he would be sent to prison for breaching an antisocial behaviour order (asbo). \nThe defendant, who was appearing at Chelmsford crown court, interrupted her, saying: “It’s obvious, isn’t it? Because you’re a cunt and I’m not.” The judge then responded: “Well, you’re a bit of a cunt yourself. Being offensive to me doesn’t make things better at all.” \nWhen Lynch confirmed the defendant’s sentence, Hennigan, 50, said: “Go fuck yourself.” Lynch retorted: “You too. Take him down.” \nHennigan, from Harlow, Essex , has dozens of previous convictions, including for drug and firearm possession, and common assault. An asbo was previously imposed on him in 2005 when a swastika was painted on the front door of his council house. \nAfter the hearing on 11 August, the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office (JCIO) received around 10 complaints about the judge’s behaviour and her use of the word “cunt”. \nLynch told the investigators that she deeply regretted the incident and that her remarks were a momentary lapse of judgment which should have never happened. She apologised “unreservedly” for her remarks, according to a JCIO statement sent to one of the complainants, Robert Hackett. \nA report on the incident was referred to the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, and the lord chancellor, who is the justice secretary, Liz Truss. \nThe JCIO statement said: “Although the lord chancellor and the lord chief justice considered HHJ Lynch’s remarks to be inappropriate, they did not find that they amounted to misconduct or warranted any disciplinary sanction. [They] were of the view that the matter should be dealt with by informal advice.” \nLynch had now been been advised to “ensure that she responded appropriately to parties in court at all times”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T13:14:37.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
