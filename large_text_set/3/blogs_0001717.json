All Stories \nDepeche Mode 's Global Spirit Tour will reach North American soil this fall, when the group kicks off a new leg of arena and amphitheater dates in Salt Lake City. Before then, though, they'll be offering a taste of what the tour holds with a performance Wednesday night on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon . Related Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan on Urgent New LP, David Bowie Influence World crises loom heavily on band's 14th album \nTickets for the tour, which wraps in Canada in October, will go on sale March 10th. The band is asking fans interested in pre-sale tickets to register on their website ; those tickets will be available on March 6th. The band reports that the European leg of their Global Spirit Tour has already sold more than 1.5 million tickets, with many shows sold out. It will announce dates for a Latin American leg soon. \nThe tour ties into the release of Spirit , the group's first album in four years and 14th overall. Many of the songs on the album – including the recently released single \"Where's the Revolution?\" – address a devolution in civility that they've seen around the world in recent years. \"I wouldn't call this a political album,\" frontman Dave Gahan recently told Rolling Stone , \"because I don't listen to music in a political way. But it's definitely about humanity, and our place in that.\" \nGahan added that it was a sentiment reflected in the album title. \"We called the album Spirit , because it's like, 'Where's the spirit gone?' or 'Where's the spirit in humanity?'\" Gahan said. \"We considered calling it Maelstrom – that was a bit too heavy metal.\" \nDepeche Mode Tour Dates \nAugust 23 - Salt Lake City, UT @ USANA Amphitheatre August 25 - Denver, CO @ Pepsi Center August 27 - Detroit, MI @ DTE Energy Music Theatre August 30 - Chicago, IL @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre September 1 - Uncasville, CT @ Mohegan Sun Arena September 3 - Toronto, ON @ Air Canada Centre September 5 - Montreal, QC @ Centre Bell September 7 - Washington, DC @ Verizon Center September 9 - New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden September 11 - New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden September 13 - Tampa, FL @ MIDFLORIDA Credit Union Amphitheatre September 15 - Miami, FL @ AmericanAirlines Arena September 18 - Nashville, TN @ Ascend Amphitheater September 20 - Austin, TX @ Austin360 - Amphitheatre September 22 - Dallas, TX @ Starplex Pavilion September 24 - Houston, TX @ Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion September 27 - Phoenix, AZ @ AK-Chin Pavilion September 30 - Las Vegas, NV @ T-Mobile Arena October 2 - Santa Barbara, CA @ Santa Barbara County Bowl October 6 - San Diego, CA @ Mattress Firm Amphitheatre October 8 - San Jose, CA @ SAP Center October 10 - Oakland, CA @ Oracle Arena October 12 - Los Angeles, CA @ Hollywood Bowl October 14 - Los Angeles, CA @ Hollywood Bowl October 21 - Seattle, WA @ KeyArena October 23 - Portland, OR @ Moda Center October 25 - Vancouver, BC @ Rogers Arena October 27 - Edmonton, AB @ Rogers Place More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:35:20.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
