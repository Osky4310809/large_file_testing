I think it might be. Chelsea have been linked with the Swansea City striker for most of January, either with or without Michy Batshuayi going on loan the other way, but even though Swansea have had three head coaches in the dugout during that time, Llorente has not moved anywhere yet. Given his heroics on Saturday, I doubt that he will in the remaining week or so of the winter transfer window. Swansea have hope again! “I am very happy here and I want to play and score more goals.” “I wanted to celebrate with the fans and say thank you. [...] It is important that we have feeling when we are on the pitch and they are in the stand. We are all together.” “But we must do more now. We know we can play very well, we have shown that at Anfield, and we have to continue and go on. We will continue to work in this way, it was a good performance for us and we will keep fighting.” -Fernando Llorente; source: Telegraph Those are not the words of a man looking to leave. For Chelsea, this could conclude an already quiet transfer window (at least in terms of arrivals). For now, that’s not an issue, and while key injuries could drastically derail the season still, we really should be targeting the summer window for any major moves.
