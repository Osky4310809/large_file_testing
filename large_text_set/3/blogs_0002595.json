We are leading to a very serious conclusion regarding the potentially perilous state of British policing in this report HM Inspector Zoe Billingham \nI nspectors found evidence of some emergency calls being downgraded in order to justify a slower response and failings in responding to vulnerable victims. \nFewer arrests were made, a large number of crimes were effectively \"written off\", suspects were not always pursued and inexperienced officers were left to carry out complex investigations, the review found. \nHM Inspector Zoe Billingham said: \"We are leading to a very serious conclusion regarding the potentially perilous state of British policing in this report. \n\"Over the last few years, HMIC has said consistently that police forces were managing well in increasingly difficult circumstances.\" \nShe said she was raising \"a red flag\" over the consequences of \"an unconscious form of rationing of police services.\" Police services are being unconsciously rationed, the inspector said Credit: Dan Kitwood /Getty \nT he wide-ranging report found a lack of focus directed to apprehending wanted individuals, with the details of 67,000 suspects not placed on the police national computer (PNC). \nIn too many cases \"insufficient action\" was taken to actively track down wanted suspects once their details had been circulated on the PNC, inspectors said. \nT hey also said that neighbourhood policing, described as \"the bedrock\" of the service, continues to be eroded. \nHMIC said it was warning for the first time of a national crisis in the shortage of detectives and investigators in many forces. This was leading to excessive workloads, while complex investigations were being led by those who lacked appropriate experience. There can be no excuse for any force that fails to deliver on its obligations Brandon Lewis, Policing Minister \nT he report highlighted the extent to which forces were not taking inquiries further because the victim did not support police action. In some areas, more than one in five cases were not investigated fully for this reason and the issue was particularly acute for domestic abuse. \nSteve White, Chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said the report must act as a \"wake-up call\". \nHe said: \"What we are seeing is a service that is only being driven by cost constraints and some areas of policing are on the critical list and heading towards intensive care.\" \nThe watchdog examined the effectiveness of forces in England and Wales, and said that most provided a largely good service in keeping people safe and preventing crime. \nOverall, one force was judged to be \"outstanding\", 28 forces were \"good\", 13 \"require improvement\" and one was rated \"inadequate\". \nMichael Barton, National Police Chiefs' Council lead for crime operations, noted that the inspection found that most forces were \"good overall\" but said it was \"disappointing\" that HMIC also had concerns that some were \"falling short\". \nHe cited budget reductions and the loss of thousands of officers and staff, adding: \"Difficult decisions are being made between resourcing neighbourhood teams, response units, specialist investigations and digital and cyber enabled crime.\" \nP olicing Minister Brandon Lewis said that while the report rated two thirds of forces as either good or outstanding, \"a number of forces clearly still have more work to do to ensure they are providing the level of service which communities expect and deserve.\" \nMr Lewis said the Government has protected police funding, adding: \"There can be no excuse for any force that fails to deliver on its obligations - those identified as inadequate or requiring improvement must take HMIC's findings very seriously and I expect to see rapid improvements.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:04:22.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
