Well, one Instagram user — Mia Kennington (@thrillsoftomorrow) — has been taking photos of herself at the beach with glitter covering her bum. Sometimes, she's even dressed in mermaid-inspired swimwear. The influencer describes herself as a \"glitter creature\" (a woman after our own hearts!).\nShe has created this shimmery body art on herself and others using The Gypsy Shrine glitter. It's perfect for festival season, as she points out. We can totally see Burning Man attendees giving it a go.\n\"It was a hectic day because we were glittering up everybody and also had to get content for our website,\" Mia told Cosmo.com of her inspiration . \"So [artist Sophia Moreno and I] just had to spark off ideas in a span of, like, 20 minutes. We were in bikinis and were getting sand all over our butts anyway, so we were like, 'Well, what if we enhance this?' So we just did loads and loads of glitter.\"\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a9163893/the-newest-way-to-wear-glitter-on-your-butt/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BSB0iU5AsEB/", "http://www.thegypsyshrine.com/shop", "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/17438336_1842139042777896_3513563675132690432_n.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-28T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:07:19.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
