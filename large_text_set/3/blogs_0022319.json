And I was sitting on the armchair looking at him and he was laying on the sofa with his laptop with his earphones on watching a film, and I thought 'There's no way anything's going to happen tonight he's enjoying this film too much.' \n\"But, eventually I did go up to bed, yeah it did happen. I didn't initiate it, he started it. So the first night was OK.\" \nHowever, the London-born star believes going at it like rabbits for round two tonight will be \"more difficult\", because she will \"never\" initiate a steamy sex session.

There's no way I would initiate it. I never have the confidence. I always wait until he initiates it. I don't think that's going to happen tonight. \n*Loose Women continues on ITV1 weekdays at 12.30pm Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:32:03.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
