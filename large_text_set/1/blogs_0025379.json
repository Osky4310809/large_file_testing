Coat a 2-quart baking dish with butter; set aside. \nMake the biscuits: Whisk the flour, parsley, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the cream and use a wooden spoon to stir until a shaggy dough forms. Refrigerate while you prepare the casserole. \nMake the casserole: Melt the butter in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until completely combined. The mixture will look like wet sand. Cook until the mixture begins to dry out and turn golden-brown, about 4 minutes. \nGradually whisk in a little bit of the milk until smooth, then whisk in the remainder. Whisk in the chicken broth until smooth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. \nRemove from the heat and stir in the chicken, vegetables, parsley, chives, salt, and pepper. Transfer to the prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer. \nScoop out about 2 tablespoons of biscuit dough, use your hands to shape it into a 1/2-inch-thick patty, and place on top of the casserole. Repeat with the remainder of the dough, spacing the biscuits about 1/2 inch apart. \nBake until heated through and bubbling and the biscuits are golden-brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool about 5 minutes before serving. Recipe Notes Make ahead: The chicken can be cooked 1 day ahead and stored in a covered container in the refrigerator until ready to use. Storage: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:07:24.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
