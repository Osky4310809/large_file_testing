No more unexpected repair costs.\nSEE ALSO: Guy sacrifices Tesla to save unconscious driver, Elon Musk offers to cover repair costs\nThe news was dropped Wednesday in an earnings call, reports The Next Web , and suggests that Tesla executives believe they are uniquely qualified to change the way new cars are priced and purchased.\n\"We’ve been doing it quietly,\" Tesla VP of Global Investor Relations Jeff Evanson explained on the call, \"but in Asia in particular where we started this, now the majority of Tesla cars are sold with an insurance product that is customized to Tesla, that takes into account not only the Autopilot safety features but also the maintenance costs of the car.\"\nElon Musk's serious face.\nImage: Scott Olson/Getty Images\nIt's important to note that, like so many things in life, this service isn't free. Rather, the cost of lifetime insurance and maintenance is built into the initial purchase price. Even so, that gives customers a straight-forward way of knowing how much a new Tesla will actually set them back in the long run. It's unclear how much the lifetime insurance and maintenance bundle costs.\n\"It’s our vision in the future that we’ll be able to offer a single price for the car, maintenance and insurance in a really compelling offering for the consumer,\" added Evanson. \"And we’re currently doing that today.\"\nAccording to TechCrunch , Musk insisted that this move is not about disrupting the insurance market — as long as insurance companies agree to play nice. \"If we need to we’ll insource it,\" he said of the included insurance plan, \"but I think we’ll find that insurance partners do adjust rates proportionate to the risk of a Tesla.\"\nNo word yet on when this offering will become widely available, but as Tesla has shown time and time again, the company has a habit of following through on bold predictions.\nBONUS: Kick off and sail the skies with this personal aircraft", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jyDlYP5nJ8BvHdfCpCC1OzCAhlU=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393365%2Fe23fb8a3-d9e6-4e5d-b3f7-2fe11e434bfe.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HozZqxp0J4fH-g_gnXpSwIdonvE=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F393365%2Fe23fb8a3-d9e6-4e5d-b3f7-2fe11e434bfe.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/U8ikQXZ1.jpg", "https://thenextweb.com/cars/2017/02/23/buying-a-tesla-could-soon-include-lifetime-insurance-and-maintenance/#.tnw_lBiSyrz2", "https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/tesla-wants-to-offer-vehicles-with-one-price-including-insurance-and-maintenance/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/U8ikQXZ1.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-24T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:34:09.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
