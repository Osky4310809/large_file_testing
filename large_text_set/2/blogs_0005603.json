They were eventually allowed to re-enter.\nThe ACLU said it’s deeply disappointed in Friday’s decision. Other plaintiffs included international aid group Oxfam America and several noncitizens living in the U.S. legally.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:33:53.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
