Butterbeer ice cream now exists in the muggle (and wizarding) world.\nSEE ALSO: Bar serving butterbeer is making all our 'Harry Potter' fantasies come true\nYuengling's Ice Cream just announced butterbeer as its latest flavour, which takes its inspiration from the popular wizarding beverage.\nThe ice cream company has paid heed to J. K. Rowling's description of butterbeer's unique flavour, which she once described as \"a little bit like less sickly butterscotch.\"\nThe butterbeer ice cream, therefore, will be made from half buttercream ice cream and half butterscotch ice cream, \"twisted with a butterscotch swirl.\" Mmm.\nImage: giphy\nThe ice cream will be available at Yuengling stockists in the U.S.. Alas, it doesn't look like the ice cream will be available anywhere else.\n\"We are always looking for ways to inspire our fans and spark creativity. Whether it's our flavor names and descriptions or the recipes themselves—we’re in the business of having fun,\" said David Yuengling — president of Yuengling’s Ice Cream — in a statement.\n\"We hope we made J.K. Rowling proud with this flavor,\" Yuengling continued.\nWATCH: Test your Harry Potter knowledge before 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' this weekend", "external_links": ["http://www.yuenglingsicecream.com/ice-cream-near-me", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/SnxRFLY5.jpg", "http://www.yuenglingsicecream.com/news/yuenglings-ice-cream-announces-new-flavors", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nw4kj5T9O0EtwNACh5TfwkrF0Y0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420889%2Fdf5e6493-1e6a-4257-b1b0-bbc47756f858.gif", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/O7RaIancVYTAS1dj17STcj4-FmM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F420889%2Fdf5e6493-1e6a-4257-b1b0-bbc47756f858.gif", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/SnxRFLY5.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-21T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:42:49.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
