Marco Rubio , R-Fla., wants the Senate Intelligence Committee to include Flynn as it looks into Russia’s alleged interference with November’s election. \nRep. Jason Chaffetz , R-Utah, however, said there is no need for further investigation of Flynn. He believes the problem is “taking care of itself.” \nAmong Flynn’s harshest Republican critics is Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., who said, “Flynn’s resignation … raises further questions about the Trump administration’s intentions toward Vladimir Putin’s Russia.” \nMcCain added, “I think there is significant dysfunction in the national security apparatus of the Trump administration.” \nHe also said Flynn’s resignation was “certainly warranted for a number of reasons, including the fact that the vice president was misinformed.” \nWhile Trump railed against the “illegal leaks” that led to Flynn’s resignation, McCain dismissed that concern. \n“I wish leaks would not happen … I think pigs should fly, I think I should get double my pay, but none of those things are going to happen. It’s just not going to happen,” he said. \n“Leaks are endemic to Washington, D.C.,” McCain said. “Leaks happen, and they will continue to happen. They are at a level now with this administration I don’t think I have ever seen.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
