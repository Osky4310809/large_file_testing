The Bay Area-turned-Brooklyn outfit is comprised of vocalist Kristina Esfandiari, guitarist Colin Gallagher, drummer Joey Raygoza, and bassist Peter Arensdorf, and signed to Relapse on the strength of a single release, which I described then as \"beautiful, and unnerving, and utterly essential listening.\" \nAnd somehow, the band's first full-length album is even better. The digital version opens with \"Citios,\" a bonus track manifested as cloudy feedback loop, the album title repeated like a mantra—or a prayer. In its more corporeal form, Created In The Image of Suffering kicks off with \"Utopia,\" launching straight into the indefinable, alluring sound that's made King Woman so beloved in such a relatively short time. It's a romantic concoction of shoegaze, doom, post-metal, textured noise, drone, and wave upon wave of dreamy distortion, often obscuring its focal point—Esfandiari—in a smear of fog as grey and imposing as her native San Francisco. \nThat voice—previously heard in Whirr, and currently moonlighting in another project, Miserable—has an intriguing depth to it, whether she's employing a powerful rasp, a throaty moan, or a more delicate, pillowy croon. Esfandiari's elastic pipes retain a sort of nacroleptic, transcendental quality, swirling up thoughts of opium dens and bad trips even as choral-dappled tracks like \"Manna\" feel steeped in ornate religiosity—a kyrie for the abyss. The latter (heard on \"Citios\" as well as in the inclusion of an unsettling church hymn at the very end of album closer \"Hem\") feels like a nod to her own deep spirituality, and the years of religious torment that funneled energy into the creation of King Woman itself. The album title, Created In The Image of Suffering , is no joke; Esfandiari has lived through hell, and came out swinging a microphone cord. \nWe're streaming it in full below, and you can preorder the album from Relapse (or directly from the band ).
