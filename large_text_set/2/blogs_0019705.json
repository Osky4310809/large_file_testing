Welcome to AM.GREG HUNT: Good morning, Sabra. SABRA LANE: I understand that this means that there will be supply now stored within Australia in about two months' time. How many more people will be able to access the drug after these changes?GREG HUNT: Well, what this means is that there will be a supply to meet all Australian demand. That won't happen overnight but what we've done here is issue a call for people to be able to establish an interim supply for and within Australia through importation. That will change the situation quite significantly so last year the law was put in place which made medicinal cannabis available. Now however, I want to on coming into the portfolio, deal immediately with the question of supply and so we're creating an interim national supply through an import process done by private companies. We've already had very strong interest. Today we are issuing the call through the Health Department and the office of drug control for particular applications and in the meantime this will be available whilst state cultivation is occurring in Victoria. I think they're doing a very good job and ultimately private cultivation and so the first license for private cultivation was issued last week and that will take time but we want to get on right now in making easier and faster access available for patients who are ultimately the real users of safe, high quality appropriately obtained medicine. SABRA LANE: Okay, so you'll allow importation of the drug until domestic production meets demand; when do you think that will happen?GREG HUNT: So Victoria has indicated to me that they're looking at the middle of the year if not a little bit later. They're doing all of the right things and in addition to that, they are looking to fill that gap. They're not promising that they will cover everyone in Australia so we will make sure that there are sufficient supplies for all of the medical demand. In addition to that, you then have the private cultivation program which is being developed for the long term supplies. So our goal though right now, as quickly as possible, is to make sure that where doctors who are appropriately authorised do prescribe this as a medicine because it is a very serious medicine and it's appropriately done by doctors, where they do that then people will be able to access that medicine. I think that's my task, my duty and it's one of the first things I've done in the role. SABRA LANE: Sure, but just quickly, when do you think that there might be a local production of this to be able to meet local demand entirely without importing it?GREG HUNT: Well, Victoria has talked about the middle of the year. I've spoken directly with the Victorian Health Minister and I commend what they're doing. So they're talking about the middle of the year but it may not meet all supply. If not, I'm assuring off the basis of the first of the licences, that that may take a year but what we want to do is ensure continuous adequate supply of ...SABRA LANE: Sure, we understand that point. GREG HUNT: ... product. SABRA LANE: Earlier in the year, there were calls for an amnesty for patients buying the medicine illegally. The Prime Minister ruled it out but this is effectively saying that the Government needed to allow more access. Will you reconsider an amnesty?GREG HUNT: That's not actually an issue for the Commonwealth Government. That is entirely under state law so our role constitutionally is to make this medicine available. The states have sole and exclusive ownership of the laws relating to the treatment of individuals with possession so that's entirely a matter for the states. SABRA LANE: You've been the Health Minister for more than a month: What kind of freedom have you been given to fix problems within the portfolio? GREG HUNT: The Prime Minister has been very forthcoming. As he said only last week, he was very keen, he said this in Parliament, for me to work with the medical profession and I'm developing a long term national health plan and that's aimed at firstly the rock solid support for Medicare, the support for the hospital system, mental health and preventative health which is a deep personal passion, a deep passion and then medical research. Right now we're working with the different doctors' groups from the AMA, the College of General Practitioners. I met last night with the head of the council of all of the different speciality colleges in Australia and so we're working with the different medical groups on that long term plan, on an agreement and I've got to say I've been very, very heartened about the constructive way that all of them have gone about it. SABRA LANE: Sure but have you got a role as a kind of \"Mr Fix-It\" and the Prime Minister last week said that Government was revisiting this issue of the Medicare rebate freeze. Will that be thawed by the budget?GREG HUNT: Well, the Prime Minister has said and I have said that is an item that we would be willing to review and we are willing to review subject to a very clear set of reforms that will help make the system stronger and better so as we bring on new medicines, as we bring on new treatments such as immunotherapy, as we make new drugs available for children with rare diseases such as cystic fibrosis as we were able to do in only the last couple of weeks. We can sustain that into the long term so Australians get better health outcomes so it's about making sure that we get an agreement where is what the doctors need to need progressing but what we need in order to provide the best outcomes for the patients and I am actually very confident that we can have a long term national health plan which improves access, improves treatment, improves the hospital system for the patient and at the same time, allows us to establish a deep, strong, working relationship with the general practitioners and the medical specialists. SABRA LANE: Minister, thank you. That's all we've got time for on AM this morning. GREG HUNT: Thanks very much Sabra. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:08:27.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
