I refuse to believe that you cannot see beyond a headscarf. #compassionforall \n— Smeeta Khetarpaul (@Smeetatweets) March 22, 2017 \n@SouthLoneStar she's literally hiding her face and looks upset; also a white woman behind her doing the same.\n— grace (@gracieursel) March 22, 2017 \n@SouthLoneStar This type of tweet is unnecessary and provokes hatred. Please think before you say tweet. You do not know what was happening.\n— Eileen Shepherd (@Eileen_Shepherd) March 22, 2017 \n@SouthLoneStar The fact that people keep saying this about this poor woman is making me sick to my stomach. Just because of her head scarf?.\n— Sitara (@sitarabrushes) March 22, 2017 \n@SouthLoneStar she looks terrified. Which she would be, most likely being British and bang in the middle of a terror attack.\n— lisa scott (@L75A) March 22, 2017 \n@SouthLoneStar you are a complete embarrassing mess of a person.
