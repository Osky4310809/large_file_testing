Then it’s imperative you get your landscape in shape. Attractive landscaping boosts the look of your home and creates a comfortable space for all. Here are five secrets to creating a beautiful landscape without breaking the bank: 1. Clean up your yard. \nA quick tidying up will breathe new life back into your yard. Here are some quick tips to get you started: Rake leaves (if you didn’t during early spring). Prune and manicure your hedges. Get rid of any fallen tree branches. Power wash or pressure wash your deck/porch. Consider repainting some of the siding or the deck, depending on the damage it suffered during the winter. Get rid of any weeds in your flower bushes and add pesticide where needed. Add more mulch around your trees or flowerbeds if it disappeared over the winter. 2. Use hardscaping. \nHardscaping adds a twist to any landscape or garden. Plus, compared to mulch, they last for almost a lifetime, depending on the climate. They are especially useful if you need to keep kids or pets out. Mix gravel and pebbles to give your landscaping a streamlined look. Bricks are a great way to create lines between your flowers and grass. 3. Add more shrubs and trees. \nTrees and shrubs are perfect additions to any garden. Make sure you consult your local nursery as to which species thrive in your area. You also don’t want to crowd your yard with too many – this could lead to hazards down the road. Choose a range of colors to help create a dynamic landscape. Also, feel free to arrange shrubs around your porch or back deck for an added boost of privacy and style. 4. Utilize plastic plant containers. \nIntroduce colored plastic containers to your yard for an added splash of brightness. These help to keep your garden from getting cluttered with too many plants. You can hang them, line them on the wall of the home exterior or attach them to your windowsills. Mix and match containers to draw attention to different regions of your garden. Larger containers are also a good way to grow smaller shrubs and plants without taking up much space in your yard. 5. Develop a pathway. \nCurving and bending pathways give your garden an exotic touch. It also helps to tell others not to walk on your grass. There are various materials you can use to create a pathway – brick, tile, concrete and so forth. If you don’t feel comfortable putting in the pathway, you can get a landscape professional out to help. Line your pathways with standing lanterns to provide beautiful accents to your yard. Classy yard lighting is perfect for outdoor entertaining during the summer months. Conclusion \nYou don’t need a lot of money to give your yard a new lease on life. In fact, a little creativity, elbow grease and landscaping know-how are all you need to create a gorgeous lawn or garden. \nInvestopedia and HomeAdvisor have or may have had an advertising relationship, either directly or indirectly.
