Tim Kaine (D-VA) painted a pretty dark picture about America should Republicans succeed in repealing and replacing Obamacare. Speaking with CNN's' Alisyn Camerota, he said that if the GOP touches the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans will be in danger. He based his apocalyptic assertions on a Trump tweet. \n“I noticed a tweet from Donald Trump that said look Democrats and Republicans should work together to try to find health care fixes,” he said. “That’s what we should be doing, not rushing headlong over a cliff. What the Republicans are doing is saying we’re going to jump off a cliff and we’ll figure out how to land later. We’re playing with people’s lives right here, the lives of tens of millions of people and that’s not acceptable.” \nEven Camerota thought that was a bit much. \n“Well, I mean, not exactly,” the host responded. “They’re not phrasing it as dramatically as you are.” \nRegular Americans, no. Congressional Democrats, however, are using similar language to describe the GOP effort to replace Obamacare. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans are trying to \"Make America sick again.\" \nHyperbole on the hill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T19:58:34.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
