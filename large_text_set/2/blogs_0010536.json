Durkin | 12:27 am, February 12th, 2017 \nKate McKinnon is undoubtedly one of SNL ‘s most talented and versatile impressionists, providing versions of Hillary Clinton and of course, Kellyanne Conway earlier tonight . \nBut one impression we haven’t seen? The one she busted out tonight on Weekend Update : Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren . \nShe appeared alongside Michael Che and Colin Jost to grill the Weekend Update hosts in the spirit of her made-for-the-internet Senate confirmation hearings. “You only perform on a 10-minute segment called — I have it here — Weekend Update?” she asked Jost. “And yet, you collect the same paycheck of someone who appears throughout the entire show?” \n“Is it not also true that you are currently a board member for Goldman Sachs?” Warren continued; McKinnon appears to nail the cadence of the Massachusetts Senator and potential 2020 candidate perfectly in the bit. \nWhen asked about her incessant energy level, she admits, “My FitBit says ‘Check Engine.'” \n    .
