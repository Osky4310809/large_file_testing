Watch \nWatch Jessica Biel Make Her Singing Debut \n\"It's such a challenging existence being an artist,\" Biel said. \"It's hard. I just want him to be happy whatever he does.\" \nSilas kinda made his big screen debut in The Book of Love . Biel was eight-months pregnant when she shot the film. She's also a producer on the movie, which tells the story of an architect ( Jason Sudeikis ) who befriends a homeless teen ( Maisie Williams ) after his pregnant wife dies in a car accident (Biel). \nThey thought about recasting Biel but in the end she said she was too attached to step away after spending nine years working to get the movie made. \n\"I was terrified,\" director Bill Purple said of working with the mom-to-be. \"My entire being was terrified. All I cared about, as much as I was trying to focus on the film, was just don't induce labor. We took all the precautions we could...We did the best to make her comfortable. She was a trooper.\" \nTimberlake provided the movie's music. \"I was hoping I was going to be able to be this mean lady boss and be like, 'No, I don't like that cue, change it,'\" Biel said. \"But no, I was like, 'This is amazing. I love it. Whatever you want.'\" TAGS/ Jessica Biel , Justin Timberlake , Movies , Marc Malkin , Top Stories , Exclusives  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:19:29.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
