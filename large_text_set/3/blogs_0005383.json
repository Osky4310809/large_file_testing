In one of the photos, Watson is pictured wearing a see-through blouse exposing much of her “underboob.” \nI don’t know about you, but I don’t think showing off some underboob is a crime. Apparently, Emma Watson agrees. \nAfter people called her out for the revealing photos, she’s “confused” about why people are outraged in the first place. \nMost of her critics’ arguments were centered around feminism and how Emma Watson’s Vanity Fair shoot and her worldview on women’s issues didn’t seem to be compatible. Some people even flat-out labeled her a hypocrite. \nOne Twitter user tweeted , \nEmma Watson: ‘Feminism, feminism… gender wage gap… why oh why am I not taken seriously… feminism… oh, and here are my tits!’ \nHere’s the full tweet. Emma Watson: \"Feminism, feminism… gender wage gap… why oh why am I not taken seriously… feminism… oh, and here are my tits!\" pic.twitter.com/gb7OvxzRH9 \n— Julia Hartley-Brewer (@JuliaHB1) March 1, 2017 \nOn Sunday, the “Beauty and the Beast” actress sat down with Reuters to address the outrage, saying, \nIt just always reveals to me how many misconceptions and what a misunderstanding there is about what feminism is. Feminism is about giving women choice. \nWatson went on to explain what feminism stands for in her eyes, explaining, \nFeminism is not a stick with which to beat other women with. It’s about freedom, it’s about liberation, it’s about equality. I really don’t know what my tits have to do with it. It’s very confusing. I’m confused. Most people are confused. No, I’m just always just quietly stunned. \nI’ll admit I’m confused, too. Since when did forcing yourself to cover up to please society equal freedom? I think this is just a classic case of point and blame. \nYou can’t please everyone. They’ll live! Giphy \nThe 26-year-old actress concluded, \nWe’d been doing so many crazy things on that shoot but it felt incredibly artistic and I’ve been so creatively involved and engaged with [photographer Tim Walker] and I’m so thrilled about how interesting and beautiful the photographs were. \nKeep doing you, Emma… We’re not complaining! \nCheck out the clip below.
