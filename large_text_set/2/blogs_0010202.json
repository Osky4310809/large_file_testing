Women shown how to hide signs of domestic violence by state TV in Morocco \nThe message painted a picture of a violent and drug addicted man who also experienced mental health issues. \nMr Charping left behind “two relieved children,” the obituary said, and “countless other victims including an ex-wife, relatives, friends, neighbours, doctors, nurses and random strangers.” \nIt continued: “At a young age, Leslie quickly became a model example of bad parenting combined with mental illness and a complete commitment to drinking, drugs, womanizing and being generally offensive.
