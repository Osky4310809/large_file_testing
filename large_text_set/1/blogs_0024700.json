Twitter \nHillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump in California by a significant margin . \nClinton won 61.5 percent of the vote in the state, while Trump garnered just 31.5 percent of the vote. \nOverall, Clinton had 4,269,978 more votes than Trump in California. \nSo, it’s not surprising a movement for secession is gaining support in the state.

Donald Trump never would have been a candidate here, not even a party nominee. \nDo we need more evidence than that? \nEvans also told LA Times, \nCalifornia loses [by] being a part of America culturally and financially. \nIt could be a nation all its own, everybody knows that. The only question is if they want to break off. \nIf the ballot measure Yes California is proposing actually gets the necessary signatures and voters end up supporting it, there are a number of major legal obstacles Calexit supporters would have to overcome. \nThere’s nothing in the Constitution that gives a state a path toward secession. \nWhen thousands of people in Texas petitioned the White House to “peacefully be granted the right to withdraw from the United States” in 2012, it responded , \nOur founding fathers established the Constitution of the United States ‘in order to form a more perfect union’ through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government. \nThey enshrined in that document the right to change our national government through the power of the ballot — a right that generations of Americans have fought to secure for all. But they did not provide a right to walk away from it. \nIn short, it doesn’t seem very likely this will be successful. \nBut it is a major sign that people in many parts of the country despise Donald Trump, who currently has the lowest approval rating of any new president since 1945 .
