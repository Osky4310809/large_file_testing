There is also a process of acquiring about 15, 305 hectares. \n“The communities have agreed that government should take the area and use it. The surveyors are already there and until they complete the survey work, we cannot publish revocation notice and we cannot carry out enumeration for payment of compensations. \n“Let there be peace so that government can pay the compensations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:07:19.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
