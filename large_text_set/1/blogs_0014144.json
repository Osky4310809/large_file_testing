Pat Roberts (R-KS) at Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). \n“Senator Wyden, I’ve got a Valium pill here that you might want to take before the second round,” Roberts noted. “Just a suggestion, sir.” \nWyden gave his suggestion, which was for Roberts to keep it “brief” because they had a “lot of colleagues waiting.” As Roberts then went on to addressing Mnuchin, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) jumped into the mix. \n“Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I hope that that comment about Valium doesn’t set the tone for 2017 in this committee,” Brown shouted. “I like Senator Roberts. But I can’t quite believe that he would say that to a distinguished Senator from Oregon.” \nRoberts and Brown then began shouting at each other, with the Ohio lawmaker saying it was “outrageous” and the Kansas Senator responding that they could use a “little pinprick of humor.” \nWatch the crazy exchange above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T18:12:49.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
