The victory came after some confusion when the University of Guelph’s Connor Black and Western University’s Jack Sheffar went into their final kick 200 meters too early, believing the race was almost over, Canadian Running first reported. (Skip to 3:25 in the video to see what they thought was the last lap. The commentators were also thrown off.) \nThe two had reason for the mistimed fight for the finish, however. Connor Hood, sports information director at the University of Alberta (where the meet was held), told Runner’s World that the remaining laps tally on the track went from “8” to “6” during the 15-lap indoor race. This caused the final lap bell to sound 200 meters early. Black and Shaffer started dueling for the win as Thibeault stayed behind in third place. Shaffer did not complete the race, while Black started back up again and finished fourth. \nFélix-Antoine Lapointe, the head coach for Laval, said that he and other members of the team called out to Thibeault and Laval runner Igor Bougnot, who finished second, to keep running despite the early lap bell. \n“They struck [a] committee of conference representatives to decide what to do, then gathered all competitors afterwards and apologized for the mishap but stated the results will stand,” Jason Kerr, an associate coach at the University of Guelph, told Canadian Running .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T05:47:42.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
