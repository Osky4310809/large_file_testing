It happens; breakups are messy. However, breaking that normal mold is Jenny Slate, because she cannot stop singing the praise of her ex, Chris Evans . The two parted ways on amicable terms , and now looking back on their relationship Jenny has nothing but beautiful, sweet things to say about him.\nHold on to your heart, literally, because it’s about to grow three sizes.\nAs for Chris’ heart? According to Jenny: “His heart is probably golden-colored, if you could paint it.” \n“Chris is truly one of the kindest people I’ve ever met, to the point where sometimes I would look at him and it would kind of break my heart,” she explains to Vulture . “He’s really vulnerable, and he’s really straightforward. He’s like primary colors. He has beautiful, big, strong emotions, and he’s really sure of them. It’s just wonderful to be around…Chris is a sunny, loving, really fun person.” The first time the two met and really hit it off, Chris told Jenny right away they were going to be friends.\n“I remember him saying to me, ‘You’re going to be one of my closest friends.’ I was just like, ‘Man, I fucking hope this isn’t a lie, because I’m going to be devastated if this guy isn’t my friend.’” While the two haven’t talked much since their split, Jenny still hopes this prophecy about becoming close friends comes true in the future.\n“We’re not on bad terms, but we haven’t really seen each other, spoken a lot,” she continues. “I think it’s probably best. I’d love to be his friend one day, but we threw down pretty hard. No regrets, though. Ever.” You can read Jenny’s full interview over at Vulture (and you should because it is ).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:39:12.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
